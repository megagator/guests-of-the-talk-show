[00:00.000 --> 00:17.660]  So, uh, I don't know how well this is going to work.
[00:17.660 --> 00:18.660]  I don't know.
[00:18.660 --> 00:20.880]  When's the last time I've had more than one person on the show?
[00:20.880 --> 00:23.580]  Probably when I was on stage at WWDC.
[00:23.580 --> 00:24.580]  It'll work out fine.
[00:24.580 --> 00:25.580]  You'll see.
[00:25.580 --> 00:26.580]  We're doing comp roles for 10 people.
[00:26.580 --> 00:27.580]  It'll be fine.
[00:27.580 --> 00:28.580]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:28.580 --> 00:32.320]  I don't know why I've talked enough before we get the gist of it.
[00:32.320 --> 00:36.640]  My basic gist, though, is let's shoot the shit on Star Wars for two hours.
[00:36.640 --> 00:37.640]  Movies.
[00:37.640 --> 00:38.640]  So you know what's funny?
[00:38.640 --> 00:43.320]  Before you say this, I wanted to tell you to do the Christmas Spectacular again this
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.480]  year, except then actually have a guest on.
[00:45.480 --> 00:48.760]  I thought about it.
[00:48.760 --> 00:49.760]  And it's actually...
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.760]  It's just to screw people up.
[00:50.760 --> 00:51.760]  And it's actually Syracuse.
[00:51.760 --> 00:53.120]  Well, that's what it is.
[00:53.120 --> 00:59.160]  Here we are making up for last year, where it was a total sham, and I got a surprising
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.840]  amount of email from people who told me that we must have screwed up the editing because
[01:03.840 --> 01:06.680]  we cut it off before John or Marco made it on the show.
[01:06.680 --> 01:08.160]  Well, I mean, they were a little bit in the bag.
[01:08.160 --> 01:10.360]  They weren't really ready for the stage, right?
[01:10.360 --> 01:11.360]  No.
[01:11.360 --> 01:12.360]  Yeah.
[01:12.360 --> 01:13.360]  And poor Moltz.
[01:13.360 --> 01:14.360]  Poor Moltz.
[01:14.360 --> 01:19.820]  And his wife had to drive him home, and that was not a pretty scene.
[01:19.820 --> 01:24.400]  So have you guys done... John, you're on the Incomparable semi-frequently.
[01:24.400 --> 01:25.400]  Frequently?
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.400]  Semi-frequently?
[01:26.400 --> 01:28.000]  Pretty frequently.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.760]  Have you done Star Wars on the Incomparable?
[01:30.760 --> 01:32.360]  You obviously don't listen to the show.
[01:32.360 --> 01:34.360]  I don't listen to anybody's shows.
[01:34.360 --> 01:35.360]  Yeah.
[01:35.360 --> 01:36.360]  No.
[01:36.360 --> 01:42.040]  We have done all of the Star Wars movies, the original Star Wars movies, and we've done
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.400]  episode one and two for the prequels.
[01:44.400 --> 01:46.920]  And we did the Star Wars Holiday Special.
[01:46.920 --> 01:49.880]  Wait, see, I've never seen that.
[01:49.880 --> 01:51.640]  Guy, have you seen the Star Wars Holiday Special?
[01:51.640 --> 01:53.640]  No, and I don't want to.
[01:53.640 --> 01:54.640]  Yeah.
[01:54.640 --> 01:55.640]  Especially after listening to the Incomparable on it.
[01:55.640 --> 01:56.640]  Yeah, don't watch it.
[01:56.640 --> 01:57.640]  Don't watch it.
[01:57.640 --> 01:58.640]  Yeah.
[01:58.640 --> 01:59.640]  I feel exactly the same way you did, John.
[01:59.640 --> 02:03.080]  Like, you were... you sort of took one for the team there, and now you have to watch
[02:03.080 --> 02:04.080]  it.
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.080]  Yeah.
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.080]  If I can possibly avoid it.
[02:06.080 --> 02:09.000]  This is Jason's revenge for me, making him watch, like, hours and hours of anime and
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.220]  try to play video games and make him watch a Star Wars Holiday Special.
[02:12.220 --> 02:19.400]  A couple of years ago, one of the sites published a, like, what do they call them now, explainers?
[02:19.400 --> 02:22.480]  You know, like, this concept of an explainer, which I kind of like.
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.200]  It's sort of like a blog post crossed with, like, a Wikipedia entry.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.880]  Well, here's an exercise.
[02:28.880 --> 02:33.680]  Try to think of... pretend the word explainer doesn't exist, and then try to think of another
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.620]  phrase or summary or description of what we now know as an explainer.
[02:40.620 --> 02:44.840]  Because whenever I do it, I come out with something that's insulting.
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.840]  What would it be?
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.840]  I'm not sure.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.840]  I don't know.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.840]  It's like...
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.380]  I mean, I'm falling back on, like, the four dummies things or whatever.
[02:50.380 --> 02:55.600]  Let me simplify this to the point where it seems understandable, but what you're actually
[02:55.600 --> 02:59.600]  coming away from the article with is not a true understanding of the subject because
[02:59.600 --> 03:00.600]  it's really complicated.
[03:00.600 --> 03:03.820]  Let me take a complicated thing and make it really simple.
[03:03.820 --> 03:04.820]  Let me, like...
[03:04.820 --> 03:05.820]  It just...
[03:05.820 --> 03:06.820]  I don't know.
[03:06.820 --> 03:11.160]  I understand why some people are attracted to the concept, but the actual articles I've
[03:11.160 --> 03:14.400]  read that are described as explainers just leave me angry.
[03:14.400 --> 03:15.400]  Yeah.
[03:15.400 --> 03:17.600]  Like, overview, maybe, is a good word.
[03:17.600 --> 03:18.600]  Summary.
[03:18.600 --> 03:19.600]  Executive summary.
[03:19.600 --> 03:20.600]  Overview.
[03:20.600 --> 03:21.960]  Like, it's not much...
[03:21.960 --> 03:22.960]  I don't know.
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.120]  Whenever I read something that's described as an explainer, it's just like...
[03:27.120 --> 03:28.120]  You know, because no one...
[03:28.120 --> 03:31.720]  Like, if there's an article in the Atlantic or something, nobody calls it an explainer.
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.480]  An article is supposed to explain things.
[03:33.480 --> 03:37.480]  Once you call it an explainer, that's like code for, oh, we're not actually gonna get
[03:37.480 --> 03:38.480]  the real...
[03:38.480 --> 03:40.040]  Anyway, I'm unreasonably angry about explainer.
[03:40.040 --> 03:41.040]  Go on.
[03:41.040 --> 03:42.040]  I interrupted you.
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.040]  Well, I remember...
[03:43.040 --> 03:46.520]  The one that I remember that I appreciated was the one from Vox.com on...
[03:46.520 --> 03:53.120]  I don't know if it was Benghazi or one of these things where it seemed like I would
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.920]  have had to read 20 articles to catch up, and it didn't make any sense, and I read their
[03:58.920 --> 04:04.480]  quote-unquote explainer, and I figured the whole thing out because, you know, in the
[04:04.480 --> 04:07.740]  gist of the explainer, they're like, this is really nothing.
[04:07.740 --> 04:09.040]  It's really just a political witch-up.
[04:09.040 --> 04:13.120]  Well, they just called that the news that you would watch, and it would tell you a summary
[04:13.120 --> 04:14.800]  of what's going on, and...
[04:14.800 --> 04:15.800]  Oh, God.
[04:15.800 --> 04:19.560]  Well, anyway, somebody wrote an explainer on the Star Wars Holiday Special, and it had
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.560]  just enough screen caps where I was like, holy cow, it really is worse than the terrible
[04:24.560 --> 04:26.320]  reputation would have you believe.
[04:26.320 --> 04:27.920]  And so I knew I never had to watch it.
[04:27.920 --> 04:31.340]  Yeah, and not only that, as I said in the incomparable thing, it's not even the type
[04:31.340 --> 04:35.280]  of thing, if you care about Star Wars at all, that you can watch and be like, haha, laugh
[04:35.280 --> 04:36.800]  at this, it's so bad, you know what I mean?
[04:36.800 --> 04:38.440]  You can't even do that.
[04:38.440 --> 04:39.440]  It's just bad.
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.360]  It's just not fun, it's not interesting, and if you care about Star Wars, it will hurt
[04:43.360 --> 04:44.360]  you.
[04:44.360 --> 04:45.360]  Right.
[04:45.360 --> 04:47.640]  And it was shot on video.
[04:47.640 --> 04:48.640]  It's so bad.
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.080]  How it was shot is the least of its problems.
[04:50.080 --> 04:53.280]  So we're having a holiday special, and we're talking about Star Wars, but it has nothing
[04:53.280 --> 05:01.280]  to do with the Star Wars Holiday Spectacular, or whatever they called it.
[05:01.280 --> 05:02.280]  Not yet, at least.
[05:02.280 --> 05:03.280]  All right.
[05:03.280 --> 05:06.200]  And also, I only want to talk about the movies.
[05:06.200 --> 05:09.600]  The whole Expanded Universe thing is a pile of crap, as far as I'm concerned.
[05:09.600 --> 05:12.680]  Yeah, I don't mind the cartoons as much, but I don't.
[05:12.680 --> 05:14.200]  They're a different thing.
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.200]  You know what I mean?
[05:15.200 --> 05:18.480]  Like, if the movies are like a good steak dinner, they're kind of like a beef jerky
[05:18.480 --> 05:20.720]  that you'd buy at a corner store.
[05:20.720 --> 05:21.720]  You know what I mean?
[05:21.720 --> 05:25.640]  They're meat, but not really the same kind of thing.
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.560]  Have you watched all of the cartoons, Clone Wars, and now the Star Wars Rebels?
[05:30.560 --> 05:37.840]  I have, and there's some things to commend them, there's some Star Wars-y stuff, but
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.040]  I don't see how they could possibly fit into the story that the movies are telling in any
[05:42.040 --> 05:43.040]  sensible way.
[05:43.040 --> 05:48.880]  I mean, I actually feel the same way about the prequels, but every now and then they
[05:48.880 --> 05:51.400]  light up a lightsaber and fun stuff happens.
[05:51.400 --> 05:54.640]  There's spin-offs in the traditional sense, where it's like, all right, we'll make a TV
[05:54.640 --> 05:59.040]  show out of the movies, and it's in the same universe, and it more or less fits in the
[05:59.040 --> 06:05.560]  same timeline, but there's no specific expectation that they feel or behave exactly like the
[06:05.560 --> 06:06.560]  movie, because they're not.
[06:06.560 --> 06:11.600]  They're an animated television show, as opposed to movies.
[06:11.600 --> 06:13.800]  And for what they are, they're actually pretty decent.
[06:13.800 --> 06:18.720]  Wasn't the original premise for Star Wars Rebels, though, that it would be live action?
[06:18.720 --> 06:25.280]  There was talk of a live action Star Wars TV series a very long time ago, around about
[06:25.280 --> 06:28.200]  the time I think the prequels were either in the process of being made or before they
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.000]  were made, and that seemed to fall by the wayside, it just didn't work out for whatever
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.000]  reason, I forget what the actual situation was, and more recently I've heard the idea
[06:38.000 --> 06:39.800]  of it coming back up again.
[06:39.800 --> 06:46.120]  I'm not opposed to such a thing, I think it would be cool, but Clone Wars, the computer-animated
[06:46.120 --> 06:51.760]  one was kind of weird, because there was another animated thing called the Clone Wars that
[06:51.760 --> 06:57.800]  was cel-animated, as opposed to CG, which was great, it was very interesting, and all
[06:57.800 --> 07:01.040]  of them very different stylistic choices than the movie.
[07:01.040 --> 07:03.440]  Wait, when was this?
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.400]  Around about the time of the prequels, around about the time of maybe episode 2 or something,
[07:07.400 --> 07:08.400]  it was cel-animated.
[07:08.400 --> 07:10.240]  It was before episode 2.
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.000]  Very stylized, kind of looked like Samurai Jack, I don't know if it was the same guy.
[07:14.000 --> 07:21.080]  It was the same guy, yeah, and it was great, and you know what, it ends with the opening
[07:21.080 --> 07:24.080]  scene from episode 2.
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.880]  The end of that arc, or that animation arc, ends with the invasion of, or the assault
[07:28.880 --> 07:38.400]  on Coruscant from the bad guys, Grievous's army, yeah, shows up and they kidnap the Chancellor.
[07:38.400 --> 07:39.440]  That's the final episode.
[07:39.440 --> 07:44.000]  Is it in the cel-shaded one, or the CG one, where you learn why General Grievous is all
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  wheezy and everything?
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  It's the cel-shaded.
[07:46.000 --> 07:47.000]  Oh yeah, keep trying.
[07:47.000 --> 07:48.000]  Cel-shaded.
[07:48.000 --> 07:49.000]  Yeah.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.840]  So are these things, how come I'm not aware of this?
[07:51.840 --> 07:52.840]  How could that possibly be?
[07:52.840 --> 07:56.480]  Because your kids are kind of the right age, I don't know, the cel-shaded one, I don't
[07:56.480 --> 07:59.200]  think Jonas was born yet, because I saw that on my own.
[07:59.200 --> 08:01.080]  It certainly wasn't as big as the Clone Wars.
[08:01.080 --> 08:02.880]  But Clone Wars, my son watching, he's...
[08:02.880 --> 08:03.880]  What was it called?
[08:03.880 --> 08:04.880]  Clone Wars.
[08:04.880 --> 08:07.520]  Yeah, that's the problem, they're both called Clone Wars.
[08:07.520 --> 08:10.320]  And I think, well, here's the thing, I think you actually had to be a bit of an animation
[08:10.320 --> 08:12.840]  nerd to get into it, or to hear about it.
[08:12.840 --> 08:13.840]  That's...
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.200]  Right, like how did you hear about it, Jon?
[08:15.200 --> 08:18.560]  I've got them all in QuickTime movies, and I don't know from whence those QuickTime movies
[08:18.560 --> 08:20.120]  came, but that's how I watched it.
[08:20.120 --> 08:22.440]  Do you think I'm going to be able to get these on iTunes or something?
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.440]  I doubt it.
[08:23.440 --> 08:25.320]  I would have found it by now, right?
[08:25.320 --> 08:27.560]  The CG Clone Wars has got to be available somewhere.
[08:27.560 --> 08:28.560]  Oh yeah, CG is.
[08:28.560 --> 08:34.920]  I've seen, I too am, I'm completely caught up, I've seen every episode of the Clone Wars,
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.520]  saw the theatrical release, which is really just a two-hour episode of the movie, or the
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.560]  TV show, and just recently caught up, Jonas and I caught up on the...
[08:44.560 --> 08:47.360]  I think there's only seven episodes so far as Star Wars Rebels, right?
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.360]  Yeah, just started.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.360]  I believe so.
[08:49.360 --> 08:51.840]  Well, if that's the case, then I'm caught up.
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.080]  I like the way that the Rebels TV show doesn't feature any of the characters from the feature
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.080]  films.
[08:58.080 --> 09:01.760]  Yeah, but it's very clearly in the world, and it's creeping up on a New Hope timeline,
[09:01.760 --> 09:06.560]  so you start seeing TIE fighters look like TIE fighters, and the kind of rebels in the
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.440]  Empire in more or less the shapes that you would have expected, but it's a totally different
[09:11.440 --> 09:12.440]  thing.
[09:12.440 --> 09:16.800]  It's a different cast of characters doing different things within the same universe.
[09:16.800 --> 09:24.280]  There's a bit of a weirdness in that there are Jedis running around, whereas as of New
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.880]  Hope we know that there's, well, at least Yoda believes that there's no other Jedis.
[09:28.880 --> 09:29.880]  In hiding.
[09:29.880 --> 09:33.660]  You're going to have a Star Wars show, it's a good idea to have some Jedis and some lightsabers
[09:33.660 --> 09:34.660]  in.
[09:34.660 --> 09:37.620]  Oh, yeah, in terms of the narrative device, yes, for sure, but I mean, it kind of goes
[09:37.620 --> 09:40.920]  against what we heard of Luke being the last Jedi, right?
[09:40.920 --> 09:45.680]  Yeah, that's what Yoda says on his deathbed, or no, wait, is it Empire or is it Return
[09:45.680 --> 09:46.920]  of the Jedi when he's dying?
[09:46.920 --> 09:51.080]  It might be Return of the Jedi when he's dying, and he says something to the effect of, you
[09:51.080 --> 09:55.720]  know, in 10 seconds from now when I die, last of the Jedi you will be.
[09:55.720 --> 09:56.720]  Yeah.
[09:56.720 --> 10:06.480]  He'll be the last accredited Jedi.
[10:06.480 --> 10:11.800]  So there's something new that I have to learn, but see, I don't know my way around the underground
[10:11.800 --> 10:16.240]  internet, so I don't know how I'm going to get these cell-animated ones out there.
[10:16.240 --> 10:22.200]  So I said I have them in QuickTime movies, they're probably like 320 by 200, like postage
[10:22.200 --> 10:24.480]  stamps, you know, like what QuickTime used to look like.
[10:24.480 --> 10:31.280]  I remember when that was the big size, I remember when 160 by 120 was the regular size.
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.160]  But it's cine-pack compression is high fidelity, though, so it'll look great.
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.800]  Well, I'm surprised, though, that that wasn't like a bigger deal.
[10:40.800 --> 10:47.440]  Well, anyway, and what I understand is with the Disney purchase of Lucasfilm and the archive,
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.520]  and I mentioned this with Wescas a couple weeks ago, that they're more or less saying
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.280]  with this movie, all those novels and shit that you've been reading for 20 years, that's
[10:55.280 --> 10:56.320]  all out the door.
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.960]  We're not looking at any of that, and you know, none of that's canon anymore.
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.160]  Yeah, they have to do that, because if they're going to make it chronologically after Return
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.160]  of the Jedi, the Expanded Universe has like told all those stories like 20 times over,
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.480]  like we know what happens to all the characters that we love, and there's a whole other bad
[11:11.480 --> 11:14.520]  guys and good guys, and like they just rung it out.
[11:14.520 --> 11:18.320]  So you can't put anything chronologically after Jedi unless you either do exactly what
[11:18.320 --> 11:22.520]  happened in the books, which would probably be a bad idea, or put it way, way, way past
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.080]  where the books go or something, and then say, okay, it's the distant distant, you know,
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.080]  it's way past it.
[11:27.080 --> 11:29.080]  So, and it was always called Expanded Universe.
[11:29.080 --> 11:33.800]  So I think this is the only possible way to make a movie with the original actors.
[11:33.800 --> 11:36.640]  You just got to say, forget about the books.
[11:36.640 --> 11:42.400]  Yeah, I think there's a problem with fetishizing the canon, right, like it's going to hamstring
[11:42.400 --> 11:43.560]  your story.
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.920]  Just go tell good movie stories and just don't worry about the rest.
[11:46.920 --> 11:48.640]  Doesn't mean you can't read those books and have fun.
[11:48.640 --> 11:55.120]  But, you know, you don't need them to be in the exact same canonical universe really.
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.040]  Yeah, and I only read the first of those books, the first one with the Grand Admiral Timothy
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.040]  Zon.
[12:03.040 --> 12:08.120]  Yeah, it was so bad that, you know, it kept me from ever reading anymore.
[12:08.120 --> 12:13.160]  But I at least am enough aware of what happened that it in one and I, you know, I saw the
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.400]  headlines that in one of the novels Chewbacca gets killed.
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.280]  And you know, there's no way they're not bringing Chewbacca back in the new movie.
[12:21.280 --> 12:22.280]  Everyone dies eventually.
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.720]  Yeah, but if they're going to kill him, they're going to kill him in the movie.
[12:25.720 --> 12:30.960]  They're not going to they're not going to just say, well, I sure missed Chewbacca.
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.260]  Like they did in like they did in Last Crusade, where they just kind of panned over to a picture
[12:35.260 --> 12:38.360]  of Sean Connery on on his desk.
[12:38.360 --> 12:41.920]  Yeah, because they couldn't get him to do the movie.
[12:41.920 --> 12:42.920]  You mean indie four?
[12:42.920 --> 12:43.920]  Oh, indie four.
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.720]  I'm sorry, whatever the title of that piece of crap was, whatever the title of that piece
[12:48.720 --> 12:50.120]  of crap was.
[12:50.120 --> 12:52.720]  I always, Crystal Skull, was that it?
[12:52.720 --> 12:54.680]  I like to pretend that that movie didn't happen.
[12:54.680 --> 12:55.680]  Yeah.
[12:55.680 --> 12:56.680]  It didn't happen.
[12:56.680 --> 12:57.680]  I don't know.
[12:57.680 --> 12:59.680]  It happened in the same screwed up universe that the prequels did.
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.800]  Well, so episode seven potentially is in the same kind of danger zone because everyone
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.840]  was excited about indie four for a long time and they couldn't get the principals together
[13:08.840 --> 13:09.840]  to do it.
[13:09.840 --> 13:13.320]  By the time they did, Harrison Ford was really old and it was like, hmm, you know, I don't
[13:13.320 --> 13:14.320]  know if they can pull this off.
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.600]  So here we have, it works out a little bit better here because I think chronologically
[13:18.600 --> 13:21.700]  speaking everyone is more comfortable with the actors being the age they're supposed
[13:21.700 --> 13:22.760]  to be in episode seven.
[13:22.760 --> 13:24.600]  It's like how many years have passed since the turn of the Jedi?
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.400]  Well, that's exactly how much older you're supposed to be.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.400]  So you're fine.
[13:27.400 --> 13:28.400]  We don't need any makeup.
[13:28.400 --> 13:30.200]  This is what you look like when you're this age.
[13:30.200 --> 13:31.200]  Fine.
[13:31.200 --> 13:37.520]  And, and the other thing too, at the same point is there's clearly going to be a cast
[13:37.520 --> 13:45.460]  of 20 to 30 something heroes and villains who will be in major roles to do that sort
[13:45.460 --> 13:51.680]  of running and jumping and falling stuff that you need who are not Shia LaBeouf, right?
[13:51.680 --> 13:52.680]  Right.
[13:52.680 --> 13:53.680]  Right.
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.000]  So that the, you know, the classic characters can all sort of take on the roles of like
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.120]  Obi Wan's and Grand Moff Tarkin's and just be there, be there to fear though.
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.140]  Like when they said, I guess what everybody's coming back, it's like, Oh Jesus, everybody's
[14:05.140 --> 14:10.040]  coming back and you start to worry that like, it's going to be like their last hurrah and
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.000]  the, yeah, there'll be these young actors, but like, it'll be a movie for the oldsters
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.600]  and they'll transition to the youngsters during the movie.
[14:17.600 --> 14:18.600]  That was the fear.
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.760]  Like you're going to make his old guys run around for as long as you've got them and
[14:20.760 --> 14:24.640]  you'll kill some of them off or they'll kind of, you know, pass the baton.
[14:24.640 --> 14:26.960]  And then the next movie will be really about the youngsters.
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.000]  But like what they, like what they did with Obi Wan in the Phantom Menace.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.640]  Yeah, kind of.
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.720]  I mean like, well, it's like you're, we're going to introduce what's going to be one
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.640]  of the flagship characters of the whole six movie series, Obi Wan Kenobi, and then we'll
[14:41.640 --> 14:46.640]  just spend the entire middle hour of the movie with him waiting on a spaceship in the desert.
[14:46.640 --> 14:47.640]  Yeah.
[14:47.640 --> 14:50.920]  Or like, I mean, you didn't, you just didn't know who the, because we didn't know so little
[14:50.920 --> 14:54.120]  about, at least I know so little about the movie cause I've been avoiding spoilers that
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.880]  just based on the casting alone, you say, well, given this cast, I can make a movie
[14:57.880 --> 15:01.280]  mostly about the old people and about the idea of like, now they're past their prime
[15:01.280 --> 15:04.360]  and they're passing the baton on to a new generation, but this is their like one last
[15:04.360 --> 15:05.360]  heist or whatever.
[15:05.360 --> 15:10.080]  You know, if you want to use the, another movie cliche or you could do a movie entirely
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.360]  about the young people and these guys are just in supporting roles and they, there are
[15:13.360 --> 15:15.440]  brief glimpses of them or whatever.
[15:15.440 --> 15:18.460]  I still don't know what kind of movie it's going to be, but based on the trailer, there's
[15:18.460 --> 15:19.920]  no old faces in the trailer at all.
[15:19.920 --> 15:22.600]  So there's a clear signal right out of the gate that says, I know we've got all these
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.240]  great people, but this is a movie about these youngsters and here they all are on the trailer
[15:27.240 --> 15:29.720]  and we're not even going to show you any of the other people.
[15:29.720 --> 15:30.720]  Yeah.
[15:30.720 --> 15:31.720]  I'm going to Falcon.
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.720]  Yeah.
[15:32.720 --> 15:33.720]  Somebody.
[15:33.720 --> 15:34.720]  Well, I, I'm going to.
[15:34.720 --> 15:35.720]  Good answer.
[15:35.720 --> 15:36.720]  It's got to be either Han or Lando, right?
[15:36.720 --> 15:37.720]  Chewie flies Falcon.
[15:37.720 --> 15:38.720]  I don't know.
[15:38.720 --> 15:39.720]  Fly casual.
[15:39.720 --> 15:40.720]  It's a great line.
[15:40.720 --> 15:41.720]  Yeah.
[15:41.720 --> 15:54.640]  So I mean, starting out with our anticipation of, of The Force Awakens is as good a place
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.440]  as any, because it's really what motivated me to do the show and, you know, to get me
[15:58.440 --> 16:00.600]  excited about Star Wars again too.
[16:00.600 --> 16:09.720]  And the, the severe letdown, I would describe Indy four as more of a letdown than even the
[16:09.720 --> 16:10.840]  Phantom Menace.
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.840]  I would not.
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  I would not disagree.
[16:12.840 --> 16:13.840]  I disagree.
[16:13.840 --> 16:14.840]  Yeah.
[16:14.840 --> 16:15.840]  Wait, you would not disagree?
[16:15.840 --> 16:16.840]  You think?
[16:16.840 --> 16:17.840]  No, I would not.
[16:17.840 --> 16:24.460]  No, episode one is the biggest cinematic disappointment of our generation because of just the massive
[16:24.460 --> 16:26.400]  anticipation.
[16:26.400 --> 16:31.560]  And like, we, it was promised, it was foretold, right?
[16:31.560 --> 16:35.920]  We wanted to know what happened in this whole, you know, how, how did Anakin turn into Darth
[16:35.920 --> 16:36.920]  Vader?
[16:36.920 --> 16:37.920]  What's the whole deal?
[16:37.920 --> 16:40.760]  You know, like we wanted to know, we were promised like a nine movie arc in the fan
[16:40.760 --> 16:43.020]  magazines for so long.
[16:43.020 --> 16:44.020]  And we waited and waited.
[16:44.020 --> 16:47.280]  Whereas Indy four was like, I suppose they can make another Indy movie, but if they never
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.060]  make another one, I feel satisfied that the arc of Indy, you know, they had three good
[16:51.060 --> 16:52.060]  movies.
[16:52.060 --> 16:55.680]  Well, two good movies and another movie that was okay.
[16:55.680 --> 16:56.680]  And that's fine.
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.800]  Like you weren't aching to know something that has been talked about or alluded to for
[17:01.800 --> 17:03.080]  the entire run of the series.
[17:03.080 --> 17:05.880]  So whether or not they made another Indy four, you would have been satisfied with Star Wars
[17:05.880 --> 17:09.920]  was just massively anticipated with a huge gap in between.
[17:09.920 --> 17:13.000]  And the disappointment I think was even more crushing because I've only seen Indy four
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.420]  once, but my recollection is it was not as incompetently made as Phantom Menace.
[17:18.420 --> 17:19.420]  It's like, it's pretty bad.
[17:19.420 --> 17:20.720]  It's like the Johnny Dangerously joke.
[17:20.720 --> 17:22.840]  I saw Indy four once.
[17:22.840 --> 17:23.840]  Once.
[17:23.840 --> 17:26.280]  God, we're all making that up.
[17:26.280 --> 17:33.220]  So you and Whiskers were talking about excitement about the new Bond or the new Star Wars.
[17:33.220 --> 17:35.160]  And hands down, it's got to be the new Star Wars.
[17:35.160 --> 17:36.160]  Yeah, for next year.
[17:36.160 --> 17:37.160]  As much as I'd like Bond.
[17:37.160 --> 17:38.160]  But I mean, come on.
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.400]  Like, new Star Wars?
[17:39.400 --> 17:40.400]  There's what?
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.400]  25 Bonds now?
[17:41.400 --> 17:46.040]  Yeah, Bond has the out that it's like, all right, there's going to be some bad Bond movies.
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.040]  There's going to be some good ones.
[17:47.040 --> 17:49.480]  We're currently in an upswing because everyone loves Daniel Craig.
[17:49.480 --> 17:53.120]  And like, no matter how big a Bond fan you are, you're like, well, this is a bad Bond,
[17:53.120 --> 17:54.120]  but I'll wait.
[17:54.120 --> 17:55.120]  Like, it's, it's, it's evergreen.
[17:55.120 --> 17:58.480]  And the same way we were just mentioning Zelda before, the same way that the Zelda franchise
[17:58.480 --> 18:00.120]  is, you're like, well, I don't like this Bond.
[18:00.120 --> 18:01.120]  I like it different.
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.120]  You don't have to worry about continuity.
[18:02.120 --> 18:04.120]  You don't have to worry about actors aging out.
[18:04.120 --> 18:07.440]  They'll just, or like Doctor Who, they'll just rotate in a new guy, there'll be ups
[18:07.440 --> 18:08.440]  and downs, and it's fine.
[18:08.440 --> 18:12.400]  So whereas Star Wars is a defined continuity in story with specific actors playing specific
[18:12.400 --> 18:14.680]  characters that doesn't have that out.
[18:14.680 --> 18:16.440]  So it's like, it's got to, it's got to count.
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.440]  You don't get a million shots.
[18:17.440 --> 18:18.440]  Right.
[18:18.440 --> 18:22.840]  Well, even if Spectre ends up stinking, we would get just as excited next time when a
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.880]  new, whatever, the cast is just over or something like it would just be reset and your expectations
[18:27.880 --> 18:28.880]  would be fine.
[18:28.880 --> 18:29.880]  Like, oh, cool.
[18:29.880 --> 18:30.880]  Another new Bond movie.
[18:30.880 --> 18:33.920]  And I think it's safe to say, I think I forget exactly when Goldeneye came out, but I would
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.160]  say in the last 20 years, we've had four pretty good Bond movies.
[18:38.160 --> 18:41.080]  We've had Goldeneye and then the three Daniel Craig ones.
[18:41.080 --> 18:44.080]  So in 20 years, we've already, we've got four good ones under our belt.
[18:44.080 --> 18:47.680]  So a dud, a dud, you know, next year wouldn't weigh us down.
[18:47.680 --> 18:48.680]  Yeah.
[18:48.680 --> 18:50.040]  Like a swing and a miss is not weird for Bond.
[18:50.040 --> 18:54.560]  I don't understand your attraction to Goldeneye, but I'm willing to concede that we've had
[18:54.560 --> 18:58.760]  a pretty good set of Bond movies sprinkled throughout the bad ones.
[18:58.760 --> 19:01.760]  And even the bad ones are like, well, whatever, you know.
[19:01.760 --> 19:02.760]  Right.
[19:02.760 --> 19:03.760]  Yeah.
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.760]  I don't love Goldeneye.
[19:04.760 --> 19:05.760]  But Star Wars on the other hand.
[19:05.760 --> 19:06.760]  We're dry.
[19:06.760 --> 19:07.760]  Yeah.
[19:07.760 --> 19:08.760]  Yeah.
[19:08.760 --> 19:13.480]  Well, but I do think the long term, and this is another reason I thought to convene this
[19:13.480 --> 19:18.120]  and you know, I've done specials on Bond back in the day with Dan and now we're doing Star
[19:18.120 --> 19:19.120]  Wars.
[19:19.120 --> 19:24.000]  I do think though, that ultimately, like 20, 25 years from now, we'll look back at Star
[19:24.000 --> 19:29.520]  Wars as a sort of Bond like franchise where I think we're going to see an endless series
[19:29.520 --> 19:30.520]  of trilogies.
[19:30.520 --> 19:32.120]  Well, we hope so.
[19:32.120 --> 19:35.480]  Because when it was tied up in Lucas, like Lucas is the one who waited 16 years or whatever
[19:35.480 --> 19:37.000]  to give us episode one.
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.040]  And it was all because he controlled everything.
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.520]  No, I'm not gonna say no corporation would ever have waited that long because it'd be
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.840]  like, you're sitting on this cash cow, what are you doing, right?
[19:46.840 --> 19:50.240]  And turning it into a franchise frees it from the constraints.
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.760]  And I suppose by the time this new trilogy is over, we'll also free it from the constraints
[19:54.760 --> 19:59.000]  of those characters that we know and love, because they'll all be too old or dead, certainly
[19:59.000 --> 20:00.280]  the actors will.
[20:00.280 --> 20:03.160]  And then you're free to do whatever you want within this universe, which you could have
[20:03.160 --> 20:04.160]  done all along.
[20:04.160 --> 20:06.760]  But because Lucas didn't want to do that, that never happened.
[20:06.760 --> 20:07.760]  Right.
[20:07.760 --> 20:14.600]  So I have a weird take on that maybe that I so I obviously love the universe.
[20:14.600 --> 20:19.160]  I like stories being told in the universe, but I'm kind of of the opinion that the universe
[20:19.160 --> 20:25.000]  exists in order to tell us like the, you know, the Vader redemption story and the Luke becomes
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.120]  a hero story.
[20:27.120 --> 20:35.360]  And while it's fun to go play in that playground, I don't know if I don't know if the value
[20:35.360 --> 20:39.440]  of the universe is worth it.
[20:39.440 --> 20:43.520]  Like, maybe there's maybe you can have another universe to tell other interesting stories.
[20:43.520 --> 20:45.160]  Do you know what I mean?
[20:45.160 --> 20:48.640]  Like, it seems like just because you've got this well defined sort of universe that's
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.560]  being laid out to tell this particular story, the fact that you can shoehorn other stories
[20:52.560 --> 21:00.040]  into it is cool, but maybe not the best use of your storytelling skills.
[21:00.040 --> 21:01.360]  It's not really shoehorning.
[21:01.360 --> 21:05.360]  It's kind of like in the Star Trek universe where like the story of Captain Kirk and the
[21:05.360 --> 21:07.720]  Enterprise is one story.
[21:07.720 --> 21:12.380]  But what you're left with when you're done with that story, or you set it aside, is essentially
[21:12.380 --> 21:16.280]  a fleshed out sci-fi universe with a built-in audience.
[21:16.280 --> 21:18.820]  And it's really just an excuse to make sci-fi movies.
[21:18.820 --> 21:24.820]  Like I'm looking for anything that will let sci-fi movies be made where they don't have
[21:24.820 --> 21:28.120]  to be constrained by world building because everyone understands the Star Trek universe.
[21:28.120 --> 21:32.360]  I mean, Star Trek they use it for TV, you know, Deep Space Nine and all the Next Generation.
[21:32.360 --> 21:35.680]  It's like Next Generation is not Captain Kirk again, right?
[21:35.680 --> 21:40.320]  But it is the Enterprise and all the way over to, you know, the more Voyager and stuff like
[21:40.320 --> 21:41.320]  that.
[21:41.320 --> 21:43.800]  So I'm not saying that those are all great examples of what you can do.
[21:43.800 --> 21:48.280]  But the idea is that once you have an established sci-fi universe, you can do lots of interesting
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.600]  sci-fi things in it.
[21:49.600 --> 21:51.160]  And I want to see more sci-fi.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.720]  I think there's not enough of it.
[21:52.720 --> 21:57.240]  And every time someone wants to do something sci-fi-ish, they are faced with the problem
[21:57.240 --> 22:01.040]  of I have to describe the sci-fi world before I can even tell my story.
[22:01.040 --> 22:04.120]  Yeah, you spend 30 minutes establishing the world.
[22:04.120 --> 22:07.360]  30 minutes if you're lucky sometimes to spend the whole movie doing it.
[22:07.360 --> 22:12.680]  I think what you need is exactly what you said, Guy, but it lets the writer just concentrate
[22:12.680 --> 22:21.040]  on just give us a handful of really interesting protagonists and antagonists who have an arc,
[22:21.040 --> 22:24.680]  you know, and then you have a world to put them in immediately.
[22:24.680 --> 22:27.120]  But give them a different, you know, just give them, give us somebody, don't give us
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.400]  a new version of Vader.
[22:28.400 --> 22:30.120]  For God's sake, don't just, you know.
[22:30.120 --> 22:35.100]  Yeah, in a way it's like all of these superhero movies sort of falter because they end up
[22:35.100 --> 22:37.480]  telling the origin story over and over again.
[22:37.480 --> 22:39.960]  Well, that's because they don't have a universe.
[22:39.960 --> 22:42.440]  They have, like, each superhero has a universe in and of itself.
[22:42.440 --> 22:44.800]  It's not like we've established a universe and now we can just tell stories.
[22:44.800 --> 22:46.760]  It's like, well, I have a new character.
[22:46.760 --> 22:47.760]  Who the heck is Iron Man?
[22:47.760 --> 22:48.760]  Well, I've got to tell you who Iron Man is.
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.760]  And then you go, oh, Captain America.
[22:49.760 --> 22:51.560]  Wait a second, who is Captain America?
[22:51.560 --> 22:55.400]  Each character is a universe and the universe they're in is just normal.
[22:55.400 --> 22:56.400]  There's nothing about it.
[22:56.400 --> 22:58.880]  Like, whereas the Star Wars universe or the Star Trek universe, you have rules about,
[22:58.880 --> 23:01.380]  like, how do people get from place to place?
[23:01.380 --> 23:03.640]  How is the system of government organized?
[23:03.640 --> 23:06.520]  How do the alien races get along roughly?
[23:06.520 --> 23:10.640]  And the beauty of Star Wars is that these stories, the original story that's told within
[23:10.640 --> 23:14.600]  the universe, so many things are hinted at and touched on that may be interesting that
[23:14.600 --> 23:15.600]  are already there.
[23:15.600 --> 23:21.440]  Like, you just want to have an entire story about, you know, what happened in Ord Mandel?
[23:21.440 --> 23:23.520]  Yeah, I actually really want to find out.
[23:23.520 --> 23:24.920]  Like, and you can take that.
[23:24.920 --> 23:27.420]  You can end up with, like, I'm going to do a bounty hunter story, not Boba Fett, maybe
[23:27.420 --> 23:28.460]  something else.
[23:28.460 --> 23:32.000]  If you're lucky and you give this to the right people, you can end up with a new mini franchise
[23:32.000 --> 23:35.120]  where say there's some bounty hunter that uses a very charismatic actor that becomes
[23:35.120 --> 23:41.540]  like a cross between Indiana Jones and Han Solo, but in the Star Wars universe and they
[23:41.540 --> 23:42.540]  get a series of movies.
[23:42.540 --> 23:44.580]  And like, you don't never know which one is going to hit in the same way.
[23:44.580 --> 23:47.920]  You never know which one of these, the superhero movies is going to hit, but there's lots of
[23:47.920 --> 23:49.600]  things that have been touched upon.
[23:49.600 --> 23:51.680]  They could say, oh, we could try that as a movie.
[23:51.680 --> 23:52.680]  And the stakes are lower.
[23:52.680 --> 23:56.880]  You're like, well, this is mostly going to be, you can make a Star Wars heist movie or
[23:56.880 --> 24:03.880]  you can make a sort of, like the Clone Wars did a lot, like a Rebel Academy type movie
[24:03.880 --> 24:07.480]  where it's more like Top Gun and they're jockeying to be the best X-wing pilot.
[24:07.480 --> 24:11.160]  So many movies you can make in this universe with things that are already established that
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.840]  can just be plain old science fiction space movies.
[24:13.840 --> 24:14.840]  Right.
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.840]  Okay.
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.840]  Yeah.
[24:16.840 --> 24:17.840]  I feel better about it now.
[24:17.840 --> 24:18.840]  Yeah.
[24:18.840 --> 24:19.840]  Bounty hunter sounds rich.
[24:19.840 --> 24:21.000]  You could do it, you could do like a protagonist bounty hunter who's a little bit more like
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.480]  a, like a real bounty hunter though, who's looking to bring people in alive, not really
[24:26.480 --> 24:31.640]  an assassin, you know, which is let's face it with Boba Fett and some of the other, like
[24:31.640 --> 24:32.640]  those guys.
[24:32.640 --> 24:33.640]  No disintegration.
[24:33.640 --> 24:34.640]  Right.
[24:34.640 --> 24:38.680]  Um, who's maybe like Han, you know, or like, like Indy, the way that Indy kept losing out
[24:38.680 --> 24:43.320]  to Belloq, everything he went for Belloq at first, like a guy who's you, you want to root
[24:43.320 --> 24:45.160]  for because he's, you know, he's not evil.
[24:45.160 --> 24:49.040]  He just, you know, he's just a bit of a rogue, but he keeps losing out to IG-88 or something
[24:49.040 --> 24:51.760]  like that.
[24:51.760 --> 24:54.920]  And IG-88 keeps disintegrating, it's his bounty.
[24:54.920 --> 24:59.760]  I mean, they are doing like, so you have the three, you know, episode seven, eight, and
[24:59.760 --> 25:00.920]  nine that they're doing, right.
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.480]  And there's also going to be standalone movies and dispersed to them in my understanding.
[25:04.480 --> 25:07.680]  And the standalone movies will feature, you know, one of them will feature like Boba Fett
[25:07.680 --> 25:11.760]  and one of them, you know, with the well-known characters, but that's starting to establish
[25:11.760 --> 25:15.480]  the cadence of like, all right, there's, there's a trilogy, there's an arc here for these three
[25:15.480 --> 25:16.480]  movies.
[25:16.480 --> 25:18.980]  That's going to be a main story, but then we're going to start having these standalones
[25:18.980 --> 25:20.160]  to get people used to the idea.
[25:20.160 --> 25:24.440]  And I bet you, if any one of those standalones like really catches, they're like, oh, that
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.280]  standalone, you know, those characters that set or that conflict or whatever now spins
[25:28.280 --> 25:32.720]  off into its own little mini-arc, like, it's giving you the freedom to try a bunch of things,
[25:32.720 --> 25:37.200]  see which one sticks without people being upset of, you know, that like, oh, this is
[25:37.200 --> 25:40.560]  the only three chances we get, episode one, two, and three, and episode one stinks, well,
[25:40.560 --> 25:43.240]  maybe episode two will be good, episode two sucks, I'll forget it, now there's no hope
[25:43.240 --> 25:44.880]  for episode three, and that's it.
[25:44.880 --> 25:45.880]  Yeah.
[25:45.880 --> 25:50.160]  I'm actually really excited about eight and nine, because it's, it's, it's fender the
[25:50.160 --> 25:51.760]  show, uh, Rian Johnson, right?
[25:51.760 --> 25:53.280]  Well, at least writing.
[25:53.280 --> 25:54.280]  We don't know.
[25:54.280 --> 25:55.280]  Yeah, you pronounce it right.
[25:55.280 --> 25:56.280]  Right.
[25:56.280 --> 25:57.280]  Yeah.
[25:57.280 --> 26:01.320]  I don't think, I think he's directing eight and then he's doing the, the sort of the treatment
[26:01.320 --> 26:03.960]  for nine, I thought, but maybe I'm confused.
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.920]  I, I'm not quite sure what's official on that, but either way, it's pretty cool.
[26:08.920 --> 26:09.920]  Yeah.
[26:09.920 --> 26:10.920]  Yeah.
[26:10.920 --> 26:11.920]  That's awesome.
[26:11.920 --> 26:13.880]  But a lot of writing on episode seven though, because episode seven is going to set up the
[26:13.880 --> 26:16.520]  conflict that I assume will play out over the course of the next three movies.
[26:16.520 --> 26:19.160]  I do think that's the strength of, uh, of J.G. Abrams though.
[26:19.160 --> 26:20.680]  He does a great set up.
[26:20.680 --> 26:26.800]  Yeah, I just hope it's a strong arc because that like in, you know, so the original trilogy
[26:26.800 --> 26:34.280]  had such a strong thing of like an iconic villain and a, an iconic hero, a young hero,
[26:34.280 --> 26:37.240]  the hero gets to evolve over the course of the thing, but it's such a clear conflict
[26:37.240 --> 26:42.480]  rebel empire, Luke Vader, a little bit of twisting some Yoda, you know, Yoda stuff in
[26:42.480 --> 26:43.480]  there.
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.480]  And I am your father and all this stuff like that is such a good, satisfying, sturdy, simple
[26:47.480 --> 26:53.960]  arc, uh, and modern movies I find tend to overcomplicate things with like too much,
[26:53.960 --> 27:00.000]  I don't know, that's going to say too much nuance, but like it's that the bones are not
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  as sturdy.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  Like there always has to be a lot of, a lot of things in the mix and it's, uh, it's just
[27:05.000 --> 27:12.000]  star Wars for me seems to be more about clarity, simplicity and sturdiness of, you know, archetypes.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.100]  Uh, and you have to do it well, uh, and that's, that's what you can hang your three movies
[27:17.100 --> 27:21.640]  on the start of the talk show research department has just beat me.
[27:21.640 --> 27:27.240]  Um, according to IMDB at least, Ryan Johnson has been named as the director for both episodes,
[27:27.240 --> 27:30.120]  uh, so that is good.
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.120]  That's good.
[27:31.120 --> 27:32.120]  Cause I'd like to lose for a lot.
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.120]  No, I do agree with that.
[27:33.120 --> 27:36.600]  And I think what John just said is, is in a nutshell, and I feel like we can continue
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.220]  on for most of the rest of the show and sort of compare the first trilogy versus the prequel
[27:41.220 --> 27:46.000]  trilogy in detail and in broad strokes, but in broad strokes, the single biggest problem
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.440]  between the two, well, it's hard to say it's the single biggest cause there's maybe three
[27:50.440 --> 27:55.760]  or four enormous problems, but one, one of them is the simple lack of clarity over who's
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.760]  the good guys and who's the bad guys in the first one, right before you ever see anything
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.720]  it, you see the logo, you hear the fanfare and it's already very exciting because it's
[28:05.720 --> 28:11.400]  a cool logo and it's really cool fanfare to start the theme song and then boom, you get
[28:11.400 --> 28:16.140]  the scroll and the scroll says right at the beginning of the scroll, there's these good
[28:16.140 --> 28:23.080]  guy rebels who've just won their first victory against the evil galactic empire and there
[28:23.080 --> 28:24.560]  you've already got the basic gist of it.
[28:24.560 --> 28:28.080]  You could, if you're a little kid and you can't even read that fast, if you could at
[28:28.080 --> 28:34.760]  least get that first paragraph, rebels win first victory against evil galactic empire,
[28:34.760 --> 28:36.200]  just right there, evil.
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.280]  And then all of a sudden you miss the rest of the words and then you see a little tiny
[28:39.280 --> 28:43.200]  spaceship being chased by an enormous badass looking spaceship.
[28:43.200 --> 28:45.260]  You know exactly what's going on.
[28:45.260 --> 28:46.400]  You've already got it.
[28:46.400 --> 28:52.920]  Good guys outgunned bad guys, enormous resources and there's, that's, that's the whole three
[28:52.920 --> 28:53.920]  movies right there.
[28:53.920 --> 28:54.920]  Yeah.
[28:54.920 --> 29:00.000]  And it's very clear the prequel set up like the type of movie it would have to be to use
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.640]  that type of setup is like it would have to be kind of like, not even this, even this
[29:05.640 --> 29:10.840]  is simpler, like, like, like Rome on HBO or like, you know, it's all about political intrigue
[29:10.840 --> 29:12.880]  and the fall of a decadent empire.
[29:12.880 --> 29:18.240]  And that is a much more complicated story than, you know, underdog rebels versus oppressive
[29:18.240 --> 29:20.040]  empire.
[29:20.040 --> 29:22.400]  You know, like it's, it's, it's a different story.
[29:22.400 --> 29:25.120]  It's like, it's like turning it into a political thriller.
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.480]  It's like, well, that's not really what star Wars is.
[29:27.480 --> 29:34.760]  And then you fail to competently execute a sort of geopolitical thriller because geopolitical
[29:34.760 --> 29:37.600]  thrillers don't have a lot of, uh, spaceship chases and gunfights.
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.440]  Like they're all about backroom dealings and, and, you know, it's like, what is it house
[29:42.440 --> 29:43.440]  of cards in space?
[29:43.440 --> 29:47.080]  Like they just, it's not, no one involved in that movie was equipped to do that.
[29:47.080 --> 29:48.080]  The script didn't support it.
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.080]  The characters didn't support it.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.440]  And that's not the story we wanted to hear.
[29:50.440 --> 29:54.520]  We wanted to hear, Hey, this Darth Vader guy who supposedly was nice turned into Darth
[29:54.520 --> 29:55.520]  Vader.
[29:55.520 --> 29:56.520]  That's what we wanted to hear.
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.520]  You got three movies to tell me that.
[29:57.520 --> 30:00.760]  And you're just like, actually, I want to tell you about the, the fall of the decadent
[30:00.760 --> 30:03.120]  Jedi and I'll do a really crappy job of it.
[30:03.120 --> 30:05.400]  Not, not interested and you did a bad job.
[30:05.400 --> 30:08.460]  Yeah, I think it's, yeah, it's two levels deep where one, you didn't want a political
[30:08.460 --> 30:10.200]  thriller anyway.
[30:10.200 --> 30:16.080]  And two, the political thriller that George Lucas wrote made zero sense whatsoever.
[30:16.080 --> 30:20.000]  And I don't mean that in a small sense and like to exaggerate how little sense it make.
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.400]  It just, it just doesn't hold any water at all.
[30:22.400 --> 30:28.920]  Like I can see the story he was going for because you, it's sort of like, this is, he
[30:28.920 --> 30:32.780]  tells you flat out, like this is, you know, he has characters say things that are basically
[30:32.780 --> 30:36.280]  like the text of the movie, you know, and it went with the emperor saying stuff.
[30:36.280 --> 30:43.740]  It's like that I can imagine a story like that as like a side story or as like maybe
[30:43.740 --> 30:48.520]  one of the expanded universe novels describing the fall of the Republic and why the Republic
[30:48.520 --> 30:49.520]  fell.
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.360]  But it would have to involve entirely different characters and it would have nothing to do
[30:53.360 --> 30:57.440]  with Darth Vader or anything we cared about knowing in these prequels.
[30:57.440 --> 31:01.440]  I always think it's a mistake to tell the backstory of your most intriguing villain
[31:01.440 --> 31:07.040]  or anti-hero because all you can do is lessen them.
[31:07.040 --> 31:08.520]  Like a lot of that power comes in there.
[31:08.520 --> 31:11.080]  Well, no, you can, because here's the thing with Vader.
[31:11.080 --> 31:15.120]  Vader is a cartoon villain in the first movie and by the final movie you sympathize with
[31:15.120 --> 31:16.120]  him.
[31:16.120 --> 31:17.120]  So that's the arc of his character.
[31:17.120 --> 31:18.120]  Yeah.
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.120]  So that's it.
[31:19.120 --> 31:20.120]  You're done.
[31:20.120 --> 31:21.120]  That's what I mean.
[31:21.120 --> 31:22.120]  Right.
[31:22.120 --> 31:23.000]  But what you want to know, you still want to know how did Vader get to the place where
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  he is in A New Hope?
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.920]  How did this supposedly sympathetic person, you know, come, and I always compare it to
[31:28.920 --> 31:33.040]  the best case scenario of this is the Godfather series, not counting movie three, where you
[31:33.040 --> 31:38.480]  take Michael Corleone, who is a good person, smart.
[31:38.480 --> 31:39.840]  He means well.
[31:39.840 --> 31:44.860]  He's thrust into a difficult situation and he tries to do the right thing in every, every
[31:44.860 --> 31:47.600]  time he's presented with a decision, he tries to do what he thinks is the right thing for
[31:47.600 --> 31:49.260]  himself and his family.
[31:49.260 --> 31:52.720]  And a series of what he thinks are good decisions lead him to the place where he is at the end
[31:52.720 --> 31:54.680]  of Godfather II.
[31:54.680 --> 31:59.920]  It's how can a good person make a series of moves they think are right, end up in a super
[31:59.920 --> 32:00.920]  dark place?
[32:00.920 --> 32:03.080]  And the Godfather is obviously this is a high bar, right?
[32:03.080 --> 32:07.000]  You know, but if you want to say, well, Goodfellas does the same thing in a way, right?
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  Yeah, well, kind of.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.600]  His bad place is being witness protection, like, yeah, that's more like how do things
[32:11.600 --> 32:12.600]  fall apart?
[32:12.600 --> 32:16.080]  Whereas what you want to know in Vader is how do things come together?
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.720]  How do they come to a head where you are just this, you know, where you are the one of the
[32:21.720 --> 32:25.240]  top people in the empire and eventually with the end of the Death Star, by the time the
[32:25.240 --> 32:29.240]  empire strikes back, you are, you know, the, the fist of the empire crushing everybody
[32:29.240 --> 32:30.240]  else.
[32:30.240 --> 32:31.240]  You're like, this was a good person.
[32:31.240 --> 32:32.240]  How did that happen?
[32:32.240 --> 32:34.920]  And so we, we catch it at the end, right?
[32:34.920 --> 32:38.720]  I would like to see the story of how does this good person fall into that?
[32:38.720 --> 32:39.720]  Because that can be a variant.
[32:39.720 --> 32:40.720]  I like that story.
[32:40.720 --> 32:42.480]  It's kind of like, I don't know what you would call it.
[32:42.480 --> 32:43.600]  It's a, it's a tragedy.
[32:43.600 --> 32:46.040]  It's the downfall of a great person.
[32:46.040 --> 32:48.320]  It's a person who you care about, who you identify with.
[32:48.320 --> 32:51.240]  Is it through all through the Godfather moves, you feel for Michael Corleone, you identify
[32:51.240 --> 32:52.240]  with him.
[32:52.240 --> 32:56.080]  You, you, you feel like he is the protagonist that he is the good of, which is why Godfather
[32:56.080 --> 32:57.080]  2 is so brilliant.
[32:57.080 --> 32:58.080]  Like this is the good guy.
[32:58.080 --> 33:01.980]  Like it, it takes you through that journey and realizes, makes you realize along with
[33:01.980 --> 33:06.040]  everyone else in the movie that this, this arc has bent in a particular direction.
[33:06.040 --> 33:08.280]  I would like to see that movie about Anakin.
[33:08.280 --> 33:09.280]  So I, so I agree with you.
[33:09.280 --> 33:13.760]  I would like, I'm certainly, you know, since I was a kid, I've always been curious about
[33:13.760 --> 33:18.520]  how Anakin, like Luke's father turned to the dark side.
[33:18.520 --> 33:19.860]  That's fascinating.
[33:19.860 --> 33:24.640]  But I think the degree of difficulty of telling that story in a satisfactory manner is so
[33:24.640 --> 33:29.640]  high that you basically just run the risk of ruining the, the, the character.
[33:29.640 --> 33:35.840]  Well, you basically ruined, if you pay attention to this, the prequels, Vader sucks, basically.
[33:35.840 --> 33:37.400]  I disassociate them.
[33:37.400 --> 33:38.400]  Yeah.
[33:38.400 --> 33:39.400]  You have to, you have to.
[33:39.400 --> 33:40.400]  Right.
[33:40.400 --> 33:43.840]  Because you can't believe that that's the same guy and you don't, you don't root for
[33:43.840 --> 33:44.840]  him really.
[33:44.840 --> 33:48.840]  I mean, yeah, it has to be, Michael Corleone is a good example because you do root for
[33:48.840 --> 33:51.280]  Michael and you sympathize with his decisions.
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.760]  Like, I mean, I think clearly probably the biggest decision, you know, that starts him
[33:55.760 --> 34:00.960]  on a path he's never going to get out of is when he volunteers to, I don't remember his
[34:00.960 --> 34:01.960]  name, but he volunteers.
[34:01.960 --> 34:02.960]  Kill Salazzo.
[34:02.960 --> 34:07.680]  Yeah, Kill Salazzo is, you know, all of a sudden he's not, you know, up until then on
[34:07.680 --> 34:10.440]  the, on paper, he is clean.
[34:10.440 --> 34:11.440]  He's a war hero.
[34:11.440 --> 34:14.580]  He's, you know, I think he's college educated.
[34:14.580 --> 34:17.560]  You know, his father sent him blood all over your Ivy league shirt or something like that.
[34:17.560 --> 34:22.000]  Yeah, it's, you know, he's, he's set up for a career in politics and where maybe his family
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  isn't clean.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.920]  He is like, somebody could look at whatever he's done and if they knew the truth, they'd
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.440]  find out that, you know, he was a good kid from a, you know, gangster family.
[34:31.440 --> 34:35.080]  Whereas once he pulls the hit on Salazzo, that's, you know, he's got to keep that secret.
[34:35.080 --> 34:38.640]  And it's motivated by love of family, love of father, like, so here's the thing that
[34:38.640 --> 34:41.620]  could, you know, you said like, oh, it's very difficult to tell that story.
[34:41.620 --> 34:46.160]  One of the videos that John sent around that he wanted us to watch before this was the
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.560]  Dude Bash thing, where they're trying to show some of the influences that George Lucas has
[34:50.560 --> 34:56.720]  by intercutting those influences into the video of A New Hope.
[34:56.720 --> 35:01.240]  Like George Lucas was inspired by, you know, these Kurosawa movies and Westerns and Flash
[35:01.240 --> 35:02.240]  Gordon.
[35:02.240 --> 35:05.640]  And he just pulls from those and puts in the movie and the modern example that I love the
[35:05.640 --> 35:09.720]  best is look at Quentin Tarantino, all the movies, all the genres of movies that he loved,
[35:09.720 --> 35:13.080]  particular movies, particular scenes, particular images that he grew up with.
[35:13.080 --> 35:19.080]  He repurposes and remixes and filters through his own mind and imagination and makes something
[35:19.080 --> 35:20.580]  greater than the whole.
[35:20.580 --> 35:24.480]  If you wanted to tell the downfall of Darth Vader's story and you didn't have any better
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.780]  ideas, you could do that same appropriation and remixing directly from gangster movies,
[35:28.780 --> 35:32.480]  The Godfather, or like you said, Goodfellas or any, there are so many sources for you
[35:32.480 --> 35:37.800]  to perform the same creative function of saying, I mean, you could just pull that story straight
[35:37.800 --> 35:43.320]  out and use that as the bones to hair with and use particular scenes and like, you know,
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.240]  just there are, there are other examples of this type of story from cinema and it is essentially
[35:47.240 --> 35:48.240]  a tragedy.
[35:48.240 --> 35:51.760]  And even when we know the ending, that makes it all the more poignant because the first
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.420]  few movies you'd really want it to have us identifying with and rooting for Anakin.
[35:56.420 --> 35:59.520]  And then at the end, it would be all the, all the worst for the audience.
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.840]  They would feel terrible that they know what's coming.
[36:01.840 --> 36:02.840]  Kind of like Titanic.
[36:02.840 --> 36:03.840]  I mean, you know, the boat's going to sink, right?
[36:03.840 --> 36:07.440]  But you just got, you got to build up to it and then have the sinking be meaningful because
[36:07.440 --> 36:08.920]  now you've become attached to these characters.
[36:08.920 --> 36:09.920]  Right.
[36:09.920 --> 36:12.520]  Well, there's, you know, there's even like historical precedent, like, uh, I don't know,
[36:12.520 --> 36:17.160]  Caesar and Rome, like where he goes and basically becomes the emperor.
[36:17.160 --> 36:22.120]  That's a, seems like a decent model for, for the takeover of the Republic, right?
[36:22.120 --> 36:23.480]  And you know, it's going to happen to him too.
[36:23.480 --> 36:26.640]  They've told that story many times, you know, it's not going to happen to Caesar.
[36:26.640 --> 36:29.800]  You just got to, how can I tell that story so that I care when it happens?
[36:29.800 --> 36:30.800]  Yeah.
[36:30.800 --> 36:37.200]  Knowing, knowing, knowing the ending is actually a very well, it's a well trodden path for,
[36:37.200 --> 36:40.520]  especially, I think, tragic fiction.
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.120]  Um, I mean, Shakespeare, all of shit, most of so many of Shakespeare's plays were not
[36:45.120 --> 36:46.120]  original stories.
[36:46.120 --> 36:52.420]  They were either historical, uh, or they were these, you know, parables that had been passed
[36:52.420 --> 36:54.940]  down by spoken word for a hundred years.
[36:54.940 --> 36:56.240]  People knew the gist of them.
[36:56.240 --> 37:02.320]  All he did was do them really, really well with really clever dialogue and really crisply
[37:02.320 --> 37:03.360]  defined characters.
[37:03.360 --> 37:07.800]  But the fact that people knew where they were going emphasizes the tragedy of it.
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.480]  It's like the Hitchcock thing where the Hitchcock thing was, uh, have the bomb under the guy's
[37:11.480 --> 37:12.480]  chair.
[37:12.480 --> 37:15.440]  The character doesn't know the bomb there, but show the audience the bomb under the chair.
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.240]  So the audience knows ahead of time that there's a bomb under the chair, but the characters
[37:18.240 --> 37:19.240]  don't know.
[37:19.240 --> 37:22.200]  So when you know Anakin's going to turn, if you're rooting for Anakin, everything Anakin
[37:22.200 --> 37:25.720]  does that brings him closer to the dark side, like the audience knows like, no Anakin, there's
[37:25.720 --> 37:26.720]  a bomb under your seat.
[37:26.720 --> 37:27.720]  You're going to turn.
[37:27.720 --> 37:28.720]  Don't you see?
[37:28.720 --> 37:29.720]  You know what I mean?
[37:29.720 --> 37:33.000]  Like this ample precedent for how to do this well, just because it wasn't done well doesn't
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.100]  mean it can, couldn't be right.
[37:35.100 --> 37:39.800]  You lose the surprise and you gain tremendous tension, tension that lasts.
[37:39.800 --> 37:44.560]  Whereas like, and I think in that the other side of that Hitchcock, uh, parable, you know,
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.640]  his advice on show the audience the bomb under and put it under a little girl's seat, have
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.680]  it a little girl eating a piece of popcorn and you show the bomb that's under her seat.
[37:52.680 --> 37:57.960]  Uh, he said, you know, everybody's first instinct though, if they're making a thriller is to
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.820]  make the bomb a secret and we don't find it goes off until it goes off and that makes
[38:02.820 --> 38:06.360]  us, the real audience, no different than the audience in the theater where the bomb is.
[38:06.360 --> 38:10.000]  And he says, it's, you know, you, you surprise, you can surprise the hell out of the audience
[38:10.000 --> 38:14.400]  that way, but there's no, there's no tension.
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.040]  You know, the tension is what, what makes cinema interesting.
[38:19.040 --> 38:31.040]  Um, I think that there, yeah, there's, there's, there's just no arc with Anakin in the, in
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.400]  the prequel trilogy.
[38:33.400 --> 38:37.880]  It's all just annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying.
[38:37.880 --> 38:42.560]  And then all of a sudden with 45 minutes to go flip to the dark side for no good reason.
[38:42.560 --> 38:45.360]  I mean, we'll, we'll talk about this when we do the episode three and the incomparable
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.260]  I'm sure, but it's like you've got three movies to explain why this guy's going to turn and
[38:49.260 --> 38:53.800]  just the movie hours are ticking by and you're talking about the emperor and you're talking
[38:53.800 --> 38:58.200]  about people running around and shooting at each other and other inconsequential things.
[38:58.200 --> 39:02.320]  And at no point you're like, so, so why is he going to suddenly turn evil?
[39:02.320 --> 39:04.560]  Oh, cause the script tells him to like, all right, I guess.
[39:04.560 --> 39:05.560]  And now I kill children.
[39:05.560 --> 39:06.560]  Sure.
[39:06.560 --> 39:07.560]  That comes.
[39:07.560 --> 39:08.560]  Yeah.
[39:08.560 --> 39:09.560]  Right.
[39:09.560 --> 39:10.560]  That fits perfect.
[39:10.560 --> 39:11.560]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[39:11.560 --> 39:12.560]  Yeah.
[39:12.560 --> 39:15.600]  I was so shattered after the, um, like for the original teaser trailer for Phantom Menace,
[39:15.600 --> 39:22.480]  uh, there's one shot of Anakin standing and everybody's cheering him and I think the little
[39:22.480 --> 39:23.480]  boy.
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.760]  So, uh, and I totally had this weird, like my interpretation was that he's just so force
[39:28.760 --> 39:32.440]  powerful that everybody thinks he's awesome and he, and it basically he's, he's, his ego
[39:32.440 --> 39:35.560]  is going to end up eating him and turning him into an invader.
[39:35.560 --> 39:41.440]  And then it turned out it was whatever, cause he ran a goofy pod race, which what a letdown,
[39:41.440 --> 39:44.120]  like there's so many rich things that they could have done with that character.
[39:44.120 --> 39:46.800]  And that is a simplified way to go like, oh, he's super powerful.
[39:46.800 --> 39:47.800]  It goes to his head.
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.760]  Like that's more of the Marvel villain type of thing where if you're a super genius and
[39:51.760 --> 39:54.520]  you're just like, you know what, I'm such a super genius.
[39:54.520 --> 39:55.520]  Everyone else on earth.
[39:55.520 --> 39:58.800]  They're just like ants to me, I should rule over them and they're, you know, that's one
[39:58.800 --> 39:59.800]  way to go.
[39:59.800 --> 40:01.200]  It's a little bit more cartoonish villain.
[40:01.200 --> 40:03.560]  It is definitely not as sophisticated as the Michael Corleone thing.
[40:03.560 --> 40:07.200]  Cause that's what you want to happen because the arc promise in the original trilogy is
[40:07.200 --> 40:12.640]  that Vader is actually a thinking, feeling sympathetic person who finally connects with
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.960]  Luke and has a, you know, cares for his son, repents for his sin, dies for them.
[40:18.960 --> 40:25.440]  Uh, and you know, has like, that's the person that you're promised and the, the, the crazy
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.220]  egomaniac, uh, it's difficult to reconcile that with say, I think you have to go kind
[40:29.220 --> 40:32.160]  of a Michael Corleone route where it's like, he did want to do the right thing.
[40:32.160 --> 40:33.160]  And they tried to do that.
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.880]  It's like, and it can, and it goes whiny and annoying.
[40:35.880 --> 40:38.920]  And then, and the romance angle, there's no chemistry there.
[40:38.920 --> 40:43.520]  There's romance is a way you can kind of go bad, but that's more like leads you into a
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.520]  crime of passion.
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.080]  It doesn't lead you to become, you know, rule over a giant empire and kill all the Jedi
[40:49.080 --> 40:50.760]  and start by slaughtering children.
[40:50.760 --> 40:52.800]  And then it's like, well, I really didn't want my mom to die.
[40:52.800 --> 40:55.760]  So I guess now I should kill these children because some guy promised me I'll be able
[40:55.760 --> 40:56.760]  to help people stay alive.
[40:56.760 --> 40:59.440]  Like if you want people to stay alive, you're not going to be killing children.
[40:59.440 --> 41:00.440]  I don't know.
[41:00.440 --> 41:01.440]  Yeah.
[41:01.440 --> 41:02.440]  Make any sense.
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.440]  Yeah.
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.440]  I did.
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.440]  There was some other, sorry.
[41:05.440 --> 41:06.440]  Well, go ahead.
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.000]  There's some other disappointing stuff there where, um, I mean, they, they advertise him
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.080]  as being incredibly powerful, more powerful than Yoda, right?
[41:13.080 --> 41:14.960]  And he doesn't do anything powerful.
[41:14.960 --> 41:20.120]  Um, I felt that when I felt that they sort of lost an opportunity in the second movie
[41:20.120 --> 41:23.960]  when first of all, I don't like any of this, but when, uh, the sand people have captures
[41:23.960 --> 41:30.080]  his mother and he loses it, I kind of just wanted them to just force destroy this city.
[41:30.080 --> 41:35.040]  You know what the, the, the encampment, like just tear it apart with his mind.
[41:35.040 --> 41:38.800]  If you want to go with that angle, like the, he, that he's super powerful, then you can
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.000]  start pulling from child prodigy movies, you know, where there are child prodigies who
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.280]  are very good or you can do like a Bobby Fisher type thing.
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.560]  Like they're a chess genius or like, you know, an ender's game type thing where they're,
[41:50.560 --> 41:54.180]  they're a child and they have amazing powers, but they're not emotionally ready to deal
[41:54.180 --> 41:55.180]  with them.
[41:55.180 --> 41:57.600]  And, uh, you know, but that wasn't played up.
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.000]  Like he was, he was, but it wasn't about his strength.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.880]  Otherwise he was just like, Hey, it's pretty good.
[42:03.880 --> 42:04.880]  Jedi.
[42:04.880 --> 42:05.880]  Seems fine.
[42:05.880 --> 42:06.880]  Yeah.
[42:06.880 --> 42:09.440]  He seems, I mean, he's seems equivalent power to Obi-Wan.
[42:09.440 --> 42:10.440]  He's not as wise.
[42:10.440 --> 42:11.440]  He's stupid.
[42:11.440 --> 42:14.920]  He doesn't have instructions, but he's not super like the Jedi powers are kind of like
[42:14.920 --> 42:19.840]  the Marvel powers and that depending on the scene, especially in the prequels there, there's
[42:19.840 --> 42:25.280]  no real arc to the Jedi powers and it's not clear what they're able to do or not able
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.280]  to do.
[42:26.280 --> 42:29.160]  Like, whereas in the original trilogy, whatever the writer needs at the time and the original
[42:29.160 --> 42:32.640]  trilogy, it's like the forest is mysterious and weird and pretty weak.
[42:32.640 --> 42:36.600]  And by the time Yoda is pulling next wing at a swamp, it's genuinely impressive.
[42:36.600 --> 42:39.680]  Whereas in the prequels, it's like sometimes we're moving to giant rocks.
[42:39.680 --> 42:42.440]  Sometimes we're pushing one dude away.
[42:42.440 --> 42:46.000]  Sometimes we're moving to salt shaker or an apple.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.380]  Sometimes we've got lightning, but you can block the lightning, but it's like the rules
[42:49.380 --> 42:50.380]  aren't all worked out.
[42:50.380 --> 42:53.640]  Whereas in the original trilogy, there was a clear arc, there was three whole movies
[42:53.640 --> 42:55.200]  they made an arc of force powers.
[42:55.200 --> 42:57.920]  Lightning doesn't appear until the third movie and when it does, you're surprised and it's
[42:57.920 --> 43:02.280]  clearly a higher echelon of power and the prequels sits all over the map.
[43:02.280 --> 43:08.640]  I thought that the other lesson that was very, very clear in the original trilogy from all
[43:08.640 --> 43:16.160]  three movies, but in a growing, especially in the second two where Luke is more in training
[43:16.160 --> 43:25.720]  to be a Jedi or, and then in the third one growing as a young Jedi, was this point of
[43:25.720 --> 43:29.520]  if you're going to be a Jedi, you cannot, you can't touch the dark side.
[43:29.520 --> 43:31.720]  Like once you go, it's all corrupted.
[43:31.720 --> 43:34.820]  Like you can't just dip your toes in the dark side.
[43:34.820 --> 43:38.400]  Once you touch it, it's going to corrupt you.
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.400]  So I have a theory on that.
[43:39.400 --> 43:44.280]  I think I might've told Jon offline some of the time.
[43:44.280 --> 43:45.280]  I think so.
[43:45.280 --> 43:48.620]  I mean, Vader's supposed to bring balance to the force and effectively he does that
[43:48.620 --> 43:52.280]  by murdering everybody who's got a force powers except for Luke.
[43:52.280 --> 43:59.500]  And I think the thing with Luke is that he does touch the dark side.
[43:59.500 --> 44:02.320]  He uses a force choke on a guard.
[44:02.320 --> 44:03.480]  That's not cool.
[44:03.480 --> 44:07.400]  No other Jedi has done that, but he just walks into Jabba's palace and strangles a guy.
[44:07.400 --> 44:12.720]  He's dressed all in black, didn't Jedi.
[44:12.720 --> 44:17.920]  And he beats, he defeats Vader by just getting really, really angry and beating the crap
[44:17.920 --> 44:18.920]  out of him.
[44:18.920 --> 44:25.520]  And I think, I think the balance is where, when he tosses his lightsaber aside and decides
[44:25.520 --> 44:29.640]  that like, no, I can, like Luke uniquely can pull back from the dark side.
[44:29.640 --> 44:30.640]  Right.
[44:30.640 --> 44:33.920]  I'm so, I'm so willing to reject the dark side that I'll leave myself defenseless.
[44:33.920 --> 44:39.480]  But the balance thing is entirely, isn't that entirely a creation of the prequels, the whole
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.480]  balance business?
[44:40.480 --> 44:41.480]  Yeah.
[44:41.480 --> 44:42.480]  Entirely.
[44:42.480 --> 44:45.040]  And that's why I think it's BS because it's like, it's like saying, well, we need to have
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.040]  a balance between like, you know, a murder and safety.
[44:49.040 --> 44:52.280]  We need to have a balance between robbery and having your goods be secure.
[44:52.280 --> 44:55.840]  We need to have some robberies, but then sometimes things are stolen and we need to have some
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.600]  murders, but mostly not murders.
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.040]  Like we need to have some, you know, anger and hatred, but not so much.
[45:02.040 --> 45:03.360]  No, I disagree.
[45:03.360 --> 45:04.360]  I think so.
[45:04.360 --> 45:12.080]  I think if anything, ham fistedly, the Jedi order is depicted as being emotionless and
[45:12.080 --> 45:17.840]  detached and ultimately that kind of leads to their, their downfall.
[45:17.840 --> 45:19.600]  But that's not the type of balance you're talking about.
[45:19.600 --> 45:21.240]  You're talking about dark side balance.
[45:21.240 --> 45:24.760]  You're not talking about emotional detach.
[45:24.760 --> 45:28.720]  But I think dark side is embracing the passion angle of it.
[45:28.720 --> 45:35.360]  They're not passionately loving anybody.
[45:35.360 --> 45:36.360]  You know what I mean?
[45:36.360 --> 45:37.360]  Like, I know what you're saying.
[45:37.360 --> 45:38.720]  Like there's the emotional detachment depicted again.
[45:38.720 --> 45:40.040]  This is all dependent on the prequels.
[45:40.040 --> 45:42.440]  If you know, if you pretend that prequels don't exist, the arc is clear.
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.240]  The dark side is using your powers for evil and Jedi have tremendous powers and absolute
[45:47.240 --> 45:48.240]  power corrupts.
[45:48.240 --> 45:49.240]  Absolutely.
[45:49.240 --> 45:50.240]  That's the dark side.
[45:50.240 --> 45:52.160]  And the whole idea is, look, we're going to give you these powers and it's going to be
[45:52.160 --> 45:54.800]  really tempting to use these powers to essentially get your way.
[45:54.800 --> 45:58.680]  And even if the way that your way is the good, like, well, I really wanted to feed the empire
[45:58.680 --> 46:03.400]  and you still should be careful because it's really easy to slip into like, you know, using
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.840]  your emotions to tell you what you should do with these powers.
[46:06.840 --> 46:10.160]  And his whole arc is like, I'm going to try.
[46:10.160 --> 46:12.560]  He's a hothead and we're going to try to stay away from the dark side.
[46:12.560 --> 46:15.920]  But you know, by the second movie that, you know, his father had problems dealing with
[46:15.920 --> 46:17.460]  this and he's a hothead too.
[46:17.460 --> 46:19.760]  And he really wants to defeat Vader and Vader does terrible things.
[46:19.760 --> 46:22.000]  And you as the audience, you're like pound him, Luke, kill him or whatever.
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.680]  But in the end, as I've talked about in the episode, we did about Return Then You Die
[46:24.680 --> 46:30.160]  and the story of pacifism, where he's the only movie hero ever to embrace pacifism in
[46:30.160 --> 46:32.200]  the climactic scene.
[46:32.200 --> 46:36.360]  He gets away with it because Vader, who's already completely corrupted, has no problem
[46:36.360 --> 46:37.360]  killing the emperor.
[46:37.360 --> 46:41.240]  But he's like, I would rather die than fall to the dark side because it's a personal victory
[46:41.240 --> 46:42.240]  for him.
[46:42.240 --> 46:43.960]  He essentially says he's had his victory.
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.060]  His whole victory was like, can I master the force?
[46:47.060 --> 46:48.120]  Can I master myself?
[46:48.120 --> 46:49.720]  Can I not give in to my hatred and everything?
[46:49.720 --> 46:50.720]  And in the end he does.
[46:50.720 --> 46:51.720]  And that is his victory.
[46:51.720 --> 46:56.000]  Even if he had been killed by the emperor and by Vader, he still would have won and
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.360]  Yoda would have been proud of him.
[46:57.360 --> 46:59.920]  But we still get the happy ending because Vader does that.
[46:59.920 --> 47:00.920]  That's his arc.
[47:00.920 --> 47:04.200]  It's not like, well, I had to choke that Remorian guard.
[47:04.200 --> 47:06.880]  I had to get angry to defeat Vader.
[47:06.880 --> 47:08.240]  You didn't have to do all that stuff.
[47:08.240 --> 47:09.680]  That was his battle against himself.
[47:09.680 --> 47:12.840]  And when he's doing that, when he's wailing on Vader, the sad music is playing, not the
[47:12.840 --> 47:13.840]  happy music.
[47:13.840 --> 47:14.840]  There is no balance in him.
[47:14.840 --> 47:18.240]  There's no balance in him using his anger to beat up on Vader.
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.840]  That is his slow defeat.
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.560]  The balance angle coming from the free pull, I think you'd have a better argument for the
[47:24.560 --> 47:29.320]  balance being that the Jedi have to, you know, sort of be more in touch with their emotions
[47:29.320 --> 47:34.320]  and not be, you know, it's kind of more like arguing that priests shouldn't be celibate
[47:34.320 --> 47:35.320]  in the church.
[47:35.320 --> 47:41.600]  Yeah, because I don't think Luke walks away from Jedi squeaky clean, right?
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.040]  Like, he's, he's gone to the dark side and he's come back.
[47:46.040 --> 47:49.480]  Well, yeah, he's gone to the brick, let's put it that way.
[47:49.480 --> 47:50.480]  Because he stopped himself.
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.160]  And the thing is, like, he was not trained for his entire life to be a Jedi, like, like
[47:54.160 --> 48:00.000]  the part of the training, it's like, you know, like, like, or like priests or whatever, where
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.640]  you are denying in our parlance, because we just map humans and everything, you're denying
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.760]  a part of humanity, you know, if you're going to be celibate, because you're a monk, it's
[48:06.760 --> 48:09.520]  like, well, that's important for your spiritual life, and so on and so forth.
[48:09.520 --> 48:13.720]  But the number of humans who deal well with being celibate is very low, because it's a
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.160]  strong, you know, urge that we have.
[48:15.160 --> 48:18.600]  And so wouldn't it be better if there was a philosophy that embraced everything that
[48:18.600 --> 48:22.240]  it means to be human and just took the good from that, and that's what the Jedi are, never
[48:22.240 --> 48:26.320]  mind that they're aliens, and it doesn't really make any sense in that context anyway.
[48:26.320 --> 48:32.040]  Never mind, too, though, also that, like, let's say with the Catholic Church, where
[48:32.040 --> 48:39.160]  priests are celibate, there is no argument within church doctrine that what makes somebody
[48:39.160 --> 48:47.360]  a good priest is an inheritable quality, like genetic, whereas with the Jedi, not even going
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.920]  to the second trilogy, where they backwards, you know, rewrote in a bunch of, yeah, I was
[48:53.920 --> 48:58.400]  going to call it the M-word, but even in the first trilogy, they say, you know, the force
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.600]  is strong with the skywalkers and stuff, they even admit then that it's, you know, it's
[49:02.600 --> 49:03.600]  a genetic trait.
[49:03.600 --> 49:05.600]  That's hereditary, yeah, no, but it makes sense.
[49:05.600 --> 49:11.840]  So why in the world would the Jedi Order have everybody be celibate if, like, the best source
[49:11.840 --> 49:13.760]  for new Jedi would be their offspring?
[49:13.760 --> 49:19.160]  So the celibacy angle makes sense in this respect, because priests don't have super
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.840]  magical powers, right?
[49:20.840 --> 49:27.360]  So these individuals have tremendous power, and it seems, if I had to describe what the
[49:27.360 --> 49:30.960]  whole purpose of the Jedi would be, it was like, look, some percentage of people in this
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.000]  universe have this amazing magical power that is, like, super dangerous, so we need to get
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.040]  these kids young, and we need to tamp down some aspects of, you know, human nature, essentially.
[49:41.040 --> 49:45.000]  We need to get their tempers under control, we need to make, because it's very easy, you
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.640]  know, if you give, like, a five-year-old, you know, the ability to use the force and
[49:49.640 --> 49:53.760]  learn to, you know, by the time they're 13-year-olds, they will have built up an amazing ability
[49:53.760 --> 49:57.020]  to use this force, and they'll just be, they'll be very destructive, and we, like, we need
[49:57.020 --> 50:02.720]  to act as a balance against the worst parts of human nature, because if we don't, we're
[50:02.720 --> 50:06.280]  going to have a bunch of these people running around with, you know, that their power would
[50:06.280 --> 50:09.760]  corrupt them, that they may have been good people, but we need to get them early, and
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.360]  what we need to do is give them more of a monk-type mindset, because if we don't, we'll
[50:13.360 --> 50:16.880]  have a bunch of hothead teenagers running around with superpowers, and that is a really
[50:16.880 --> 50:23.080]  bad formula for peace, and so there is some, I could come up with a justification for why
[50:23.080 --> 50:28.060]  it's really important to find force-sensitive kids young, get them into the program, and
[50:28.060 --> 50:32.500]  teach them to, maybe they took it too far, like, total detachment and celibacy and whatever
[50:32.500 --> 50:37.300]  like that I think is too far, but have them in a program that lets them deal with their
[50:37.300 --> 50:41.900]  emotions and understand that they have, you know, with great power comes great responsibility
[50:41.900 --> 50:45.520]  to pull a line from another movie, but they have to deal with that in a certain way, so
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.700]  it makes some sense that the program for Jedi would be like, dude, chill, like, not, otherwise
[50:51.700 --> 50:54.800]  you've got, can you imagine teenagers with the force?
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.800]  It would be a bad scene.
[50:56.800 --> 50:57.800]  Yeah.
[50:57.800 --> 51:00.840]  Let's take a break, and we'll come back to that.
[51:00.840 --> 51:03.880]  I'm going to come back to this question of the Jedi Order.
[51:03.880 --> 51:08.880]  I want to thank our first sponsor, and it's our very good friends at Backblaze.
[51:08.880 --> 51:15.660]  You guys know Backblaze, online, unlimited, un-throttled backup for the Mac.
[51:15.660 --> 51:19.640]  You just go to their website, you download the software, put it on your Mac, you get
[51:19.640 --> 51:24.040]  a free month, you're done.
[51:24.040 --> 51:27.720]  Everything on your Mac, your external hard drives, your internal hard drive, it just
[51:27.720 --> 51:31.940]  syncs up to the Backblaze cloud, everything's there.
[51:31.940 --> 51:33.580]  You want to restore your whole disk?
[51:33.580 --> 51:34.580]  You can restore your whole disk.
[51:34.580 --> 51:39.720]  You can order a USB disk, they'll put everything on a USB disk, you pay them for the USB disk,
[51:39.720 --> 51:42.460]  like they charge wholesale prices, you don't pay a lot.
[51:42.460 --> 51:44.320]  Next day delivery, you get your disk.
[51:44.320 --> 51:47.960]  You want to restore one file, just one file, you can do that too.
[51:47.960 --> 51:50.400]  You can do it from your iPhone, they have an iPhone app.
[51:50.400 --> 51:55.160]  You log in with your Backblaze credentials, you can get one file.
[51:55.160 --> 51:59.400]  Send it from your phone, email it to somebody, you're done, you're not even near your Mac,
[51:59.400 --> 52:01.680]  you have access to your files.
[52:01.680 --> 52:05.200]  I've been talking about Backblaze for a year, probably two years.
[52:05.200 --> 52:08.400]  I can't believe that there are people who listen to this show who still haven't signed
[52:08.400 --> 52:09.900]  up for Backblaze.
[52:09.900 --> 52:14.520]  They keep coming back to sponsor the show though because people keep signing up.

[52:37.560 --> 52:45.720]  Here's where you go to sign up, Backblaze.com slash daring fireball, Backblaze.com, which
[52:45.720 --> 52:52.320]  I can never pronounce correctly, slash daring fireball.
[52:52.320 --> 52:53.320]  Jedi Order.
[52:53.320 --> 52:56.020]  See, this is one of those things.
[52:56.020 --> 53:00.560]  Big picture, big picture Star Wars double trilogy.
[53:00.560 --> 53:05.800]  The thing that has always stood out to me, I thought even with the original trilogy,
[53:05.800 --> 53:10.140]  by the time we got to Return of the Jedi, that Lucas didn't really have all this shit
[53:10.140 --> 53:11.520]  worked out at the beginning.
[53:11.520 --> 53:17.700]  I mean, not even by a long shot, but then with the second trilogy, it just reeks to
[53:17.700 --> 53:22.480]  high hell of stuff that he made up on the fly.
[53:22.480 --> 53:27.920]  Almost everything in the prequel trilogy to me shows, and it almost wrecks the stuff in
[53:27.920 --> 53:29.800]  the original trilogy.
[53:29.800 --> 53:31.360]  So I think it was great.
[53:31.360 --> 53:36.520]  I think it worked really well when you're doing Star Wars, because you can just say
[53:36.520 --> 53:42.320]  stuff as throwaway lines, and people can fill in the background, because it's not particularly
[53:42.320 --> 53:47.600]  pertinent to the tale of destroying the Death Star, right?
[53:47.600 --> 53:54.040]  And Empire kind of builds on that a little bit, because there was a flimsy enough sort
[53:54.040 --> 53:57.680]  of shell before that it could build into it a bit.
[53:57.680 --> 54:01.320]  Return of the Jedi just kind of goes a little bit off the rails, like I don't understand
[54:01.320 --> 54:03.160]  what's going on so much.
[54:03.160 --> 54:06.080]  But the prequel trilogy makes no sense at all.
[54:06.080 --> 54:08.040]  I don't understand the Jedi Order.
[54:08.040 --> 54:11.040]  The Sith seem like the most ineffective, like, really?
[54:11.040 --> 54:12.040]  There's only ever two of them?
[54:12.040 --> 54:13.040]  What?
[54:13.040 --> 54:14.040]  I don't get it.
[54:14.040 --> 54:19.240]  I don't understand the rationale for that at all, or how that can be, like, a legitimate
[54:19.240 --> 54:20.240]  threat.
[54:20.240 --> 54:21.960]  To a Jedi Order of thousands.
[54:21.960 --> 54:22.960]  Yeah.
[54:22.960 --> 54:26.480]  Well, it turns out they were, because they took them out, but still, you know.
[54:26.480 --> 54:29.760]  I'm sure it's explained in the Expanded Universe that I haven't read, but it makes sense to
[54:29.760 --> 54:38.080]  me that kind of in an evil organization, where, like, might makes right, if you are mighty
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.060]  enough, there is no reason to have a bunch of henchmen hanging around.
[54:43.060 --> 54:47.120]  And so if the Sith all kill each other until there's only two left, I mean, I didn't listen
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.120]  to the talk show with Whiskas yet, but the title, Leads and Relieves, you came to the
[54:51.120 --> 54:52.120]  same conclusion.
[54:52.120 --> 54:53.120]  Like, why have an apprentice then?
[54:53.120 --> 54:54.960]  Because the whole idea with the apprentice isn't going to kill him.
[54:54.960 --> 54:58.460]  It's like a wolf pack, where, like, eventually the lead wolf gets old, and some other wolf
[54:58.460 --> 55:02.840]  challenges him to a fight and wins, and then he's the head wolf, he's the alpha wolf, right?
[55:02.840 --> 55:08.540]  That type of model where the strongest survives, and the Sith tradition, you can hang a lot
[55:08.540 --> 55:11.000]  of stuff on tradition, because tradition is like, well, it doesn't make any rational sense
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  to talk about.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  It's just the way it's always been done.
[55:13.000 --> 55:14.000]  Sure.
[55:14.000 --> 55:15.660]  The biggest, the biggest bad is the big bad.
[55:15.660 --> 55:19.340]  But you always got to have someone who's an apprentice, because eventually you're going
[55:19.340 --> 55:22.220]  to get old and die or get defeated, and we need someone to replace you, what we'd rather
[55:22.220 --> 55:25.760]  have happen is you train some guy up, and eventually he gets stronger than you and defeats
[55:25.760 --> 55:26.760]  you.
[55:26.760 --> 55:29.360]  And it's kind of like, that's an honorable way for you to go out.
[55:29.360 --> 55:30.360]  And it keeps the Sith going.
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.000]  And so it's not an entirely crazy system.
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Okay, fair enough.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.680]  But you know, two against the entire Jedi Order is weird.
[55:39.680 --> 55:46.720]  Also the way the Jedi Order sort of sits next to the Republican government.
[55:46.720 --> 55:49.380]  That's exactly what I think is a huge mistake.
[55:49.380 --> 55:56.080]  I felt like, being in exile makes some sense where, you know, because of the Empire, Yoda
[55:56.080 --> 55:58.760]  and Obi Wan are both old, and they kind of have to hide.
[55:58.760 --> 56:05.980]  But I thought that the way that the Jedi were set up in the first trilogy was that they,
[56:05.980 --> 56:11.760]  not that they were all in hiding, but that they weren't centralized.
[56:11.760 --> 56:12.760]  There was an order.
[56:12.760 --> 56:14.600]  They were like knights, or like samurai.
[56:14.600 --> 56:15.600]  Yeah.
[56:15.600 --> 56:17.720]  Well, samurai is exactly what I'm thinking.
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.080]  Where there's not like one central, like, samurai headquarters where all the samurai
[56:21.080 --> 56:27.280]  come out of, there's a tradition and there's a code, clearly there's a code, and the training
[56:27.280 --> 56:31.980]  might be, what would you call it, regularized, you know, there's a systematic training to
[56:31.980 --> 56:32.980]  become a new one.
[56:32.980 --> 56:37.560]  And then once you do, you're all sort of lone wolves, you know, and they're, you know.
[56:37.560 --> 56:42.800]  Well that's true, because they give it, but you're serving, they're serving the good government
[56:42.800 --> 56:44.360]  or like the Republic, essentially.
[56:44.360 --> 56:47.760]  Like they would, you know, they would be the sort of benevolent enforcement arm.
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.220]  I think you could make, again, you can make an interesting sort of geopolitical thriller
[56:51.220 --> 56:54.480]  about, well, look at this weird system of government, you know, where they have a kind
[56:54.480 --> 56:56.840]  of weird Jedi Order with these magic people.
[56:56.840 --> 57:02.200]  It's an uneasy truce with the democratically elected non-magic people, like, that could
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.200]  work out.
[57:03.200 --> 57:04.480]  That's a different kind of movie.
[57:04.480 --> 57:08.940]  And you can see how a government could get into a really weird shape, especially if there's
[57:08.940 --> 57:11.880]  legitimate magic running around, you're like, well, who should run the show?
[57:11.880 --> 57:15.080]  Should it be those magic people, or should we like vote for people, or voting for a queen
[57:15.080 --> 57:16.080]  and then she's a teenager?
[57:16.080 --> 57:20.640]  And like, there's all sorts of, government ends up in all sorts of weird distorted shapes.
[57:20.640 --> 57:25.960]  So I'm willing to believe any weird galactic government shape could work out.
[57:25.960 --> 57:28.400]  But if your movie is going to be about that, then that's what your movie is about.
[57:28.400 --> 57:30.160]  It's about like, well, how do we reconcile this thing?
[57:30.160 --> 57:31.880]  And what if the magic people started to go crazy?
[57:31.880 --> 57:34.340]  And what if the political people started to become a correct?
[57:34.340 --> 57:35.800]  What are the checks and balances here?
[57:35.800 --> 57:38.200]  And how do empires fall and so on and so forth?
[57:38.200 --> 57:41.600]  Not the story I was interested in hearing, I wanted to hear about Vader and Anakin, but
[57:41.600 --> 57:44.000]  that's that's a story.
[57:44.000 --> 57:48.040]  You know, right from the start in A Phantom Menace, where the first thing we see is Qui
[57:48.040 --> 57:55.160]  Gon and his, you know, Padawan, Obi-Wan, you know, being sent by the Chancellor to do some,
[57:55.160 --> 57:57.880]  you know, fix a trade dispute or whatever.
[57:57.880 --> 58:01.120]  It's just that just didn't seem to me what the Jedi were about.
[58:01.120 --> 58:04.360]  It didn't seem to me like the Jedi were people who did the bidding of the government, like
[58:04.360 --> 58:06.360]  cops, you know,
[58:06.360 --> 58:09.320]  like, I mean, like knights serve the king, right?
[58:09.320 --> 58:12.440]  Yeah, like samurai serve their their feudal masters.
[58:12.440 --> 58:14.040]  Well, I have loyalty to that.
[58:14.040 --> 58:16.360]  I think they were Ronan, I think is the right word.
[58:16.360 --> 58:20.960]  I thought I always imagined the Jedi as as a sort of Ronan, you know, that they didn't
[58:20.960 --> 58:21.960]  serve a master.
[58:21.960 --> 58:24.040]  They serve the force was their master.
[58:24.040 --> 58:26.520]  And like a natural sense of truth and justice.
[58:26.520 --> 58:27.800]  Yeah, that would make sense.
[58:27.800 --> 58:30.680]  And I mean, and then you don't have the Jedi Council at all.
[58:30.680 --> 58:33.840]  When you have basically a government, you could still do the government angle if they
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.620]  really into that was like, well, you've got the Republic.
[58:35.620 --> 58:39.200]  But what's the deal with these Jedi that don't serve any master that are super powerful that
[58:39.200 --> 58:40.200]  are running around?
[58:40.200 --> 58:43.080]  We're just supposed to trust that they're going to be like, benevolent or whatever you
[58:43.080 --> 58:44.080]  can.
[58:44.080 --> 58:46.720]  The other angle you can go is like Merlin serving King Arthur.
[58:46.720 --> 58:50.400]  It's like, well, there's not that many of these guys, but they are running around.
[58:50.400 --> 58:53.000]  And we would like to have one in house.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  But there's other ones out there.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  How do you deal with wizards?
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.240]  How do you deal with people who can, who are not not constrained by any government and
[59:00.240 --> 59:05.040]  have powers that you don't understand it, but that are significantly powerful?
[59:05.040 --> 59:11.120]  Yeah, well, and then you can have something like that, where maybe one or so a very small
[59:11.120 --> 59:18.080]  handful of Jedi could volunteer to be the handful of ones who serve the Chancellor of
[59:18.080 --> 59:19.760]  the Senate or something like that.
[59:19.760 --> 59:21.080]  But not the whole order.
[59:21.080 --> 59:26.160]  I feel like, you know, they were they were like a sort of quasi independent police force,
[59:26.160 --> 59:29.720]  which I thought was just way off for the tone that was set by the original.
[59:29.720 --> 59:34.520]  And they did, once they bring in the whole youngling, and like the kids and everything,
[59:34.520 --> 59:38.280]  I mean that that the precedent for that was set in the movie when Luke shows up and Dagobah
[59:38.280 --> 59:40.680]  is like, he's too old, yes, too old to begin the training.
[59:40.680 --> 59:43.000]  It's like, well, I remember when I watched the movie, like, what do you mean too old?
[59:43.000 --> 59:44.000]  He's not too old.
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.120]  He's like, he's just just barely an adult.
[59:46.120 --> 59:49.880]  Like it's, that's, isn't that the perfect time to that's like when you would go into
[59:49.880 --> 59:54.940]  the army or be trained or whatever, but the that comment from Yoda and the prequels make
[59:54.940 --> 59:58.640]  clear that the whole idea was like, get them when they're young, get them like, pull them
[59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.440]  away from their parents, either get when they're toddlers, bring them in here.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.460]  And that again, my explanation for that in my head can is like, well, you really need
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:08.480]  to get them when they're young, because if you left to their own devices, you'll have
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.480]  a serious problem.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:15.060]  So that the whole order and system is like, that seems like it would be the most important
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.380]  function of the Jedi Order would be finding these people and bringing them into art and
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.520]  training them and they could disperse that they don't have to remain and become a Jedi
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.120]  Council who sits around in a circle circle and makes pronouncements.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120]  You don't need to do that.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.640]  So once you've established that very young kids get the force early, and the Yoda said
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.480]  that we need you need to be trained from a very young age, I think you it's reasonable
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.240]  to stick with that and say, we've there's got to be there's got to be like a school
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.280]  like Xavier school for gifted, you know, same thing with the X-Men.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.480]  Like if you don't get them into Xavier school, they might end up falling magneto and even
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.680]  even with just the original trilogy, even not even going to the prequel trilogy, I always
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:58.000]  thought that Yoda's protestations in that scene were he was just playing hard to get
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  to make Luke work.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.880]  I had no intention a minute.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.000]  Because even in even from what we only know from the original trilogy, we know that Ben
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.880]  lived near Luke his entire life, and that he'd sort of had a, you know, and they met
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.560]  each other before he knew him as Ben.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:18.640]  And, you know, they'd met each other before it wasn't the first time that they met when,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640]  when he rescued him from the sand people.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.360]  So Obi-Wan Kenobi clearly purposefully for the first 20 years of Luke's life never even
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.040]  mentioned the force to him.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.100]  Not even like it's like telling stories.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.880]  Like Luke didn't even know what a lightsaber was.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.200]  Yeah, that they have a timing problem with the prequels too.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.320]  It's like you're you're you to tell me that these Jedi were around but then within one
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.080]  generation they're so forgotten that that doesn't believe they exist like and Luke doesn't
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]  know what a lightsaber was.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.860]  If every kid in our world where the Jedi are fictional knows what a lightsaber is, how
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.300]  in the world doesn't every kid in that galaxy know?
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.040]  Like even if Vader had killed them all just before you were born, you're still gonna know
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040]  about them.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]  Like they have, you know.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.560]  Right, we know in the same the way that in the same way that we all know who the samurai
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.560]  were.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]  Right, exactly, right.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.080]  So that I mean that's timing wise that's a problem, but when Yoda said he's too old,
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.480]  the reason that always stood out to me because because he seems to be the perfect age.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.760]  And the fact that Yoda would pull out the too old and that, you know, it would be ridiculous
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.920]  like well it would say like he's too short.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920]  Like it would be the same.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920]  What do you mean he's too short?
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.320]  He's like average height for a person seems fine.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.000]  Maybe Jedi have to be super short, right?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.440]  So when he said he's too old he wouldn't pull that out and yes he didn't want to train him
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.600]  he was trying to back out or whatever but why pull up something so preposterous and
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.520]  the answer is it's not preposterous that Jedi actually are trained from a super young age
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.840]  and you don't usually get them by the time they're they're practically an adult because
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.120]  by then it's they're they're too set in their ways.
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.160]  It doesn't make much sense in the context of Luke because again my whole rationale of
[01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.800]  wanting them young is like they should be feeling the force when they're very young
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.360]  and by the time they get that old they'll just be like completely reckless force users
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.720]  whereas Luke has no idea that he even has the force until A New Hope so that's well
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.460]  there's there's two things there a I don't believe for a second that Yoda did not intend
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:04.820]  to train Luke he's just saying that because he wants to see what how Luke reacts that's
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:10.340]  my he's testing him no he's he's arguing with Obi-Wan because he doesn't what's he gonna
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.960]  do not train Luke and then just let let the galaxy go on being the way it is no but he
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.440]  like he's out of the game like he's on Dagobah he's hanging around he's looking at the animals
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.800]  and the lizards and stuff he's kind of checked out and like he's trying to try and pull him
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.860]  back in like oh he just can you train one more Jedi I think it's a at best a protestation
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.400]  like I don't want to get out of bed fine I know I've got to get out of bed and train
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:35.600]  this guy that's why the thing would be the thing well yeah it is a legitimate argument
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:44.440]  and and this is where I back you up is that Luke doesn't believe he can lift the x-wing
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.160]  and that goes to him being too old because he's got an experience and he's got like he
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:55.980]  he understands how heavy one is and like the other end like yeah like this is why you fail
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.480]  you can't you don't believe in this stuff enough so it's like in the matrix when the
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.020]  little kid has no problem you know there is no spoon and when you're older you're like
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.060]  what do you mean the spoon is totally there and it's harder because you're more set in
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:11.480]  your ways that's the that's the other angle for him being too old I think it's it's the
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.080]  least his age is the least of the problems with the chronology there the boy is reckless
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:23.160]  yeah yeah yeah I know I mean the the the Empire just it should have been around for like hundreds
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.920]  of years of this yeah it should not have been only 15 years old and in fact they don't say
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.760]  that though well they do say before the Empire because you could have had a benevolent Empire
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:37.760]  but you don't know how old Obi-Wan is he could you don't know how long lifespans are in this
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:43.260]  universe and he's a Jedi and Yoda is super old too and like there are many outs like
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.600]  that the chronology made sense when you just had the original trilogy but when you when
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:52.560]  you connect it up in the way they did then you're like then you think everyone forgot
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.960]  about the Jedi I mean I know you're on Tatooine it's far away and stuff but seriously man
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.640]  like you get TV and like yeah I mean what what's his name even calls tells Vader it's
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.840]  an ancient you're the last practitioner of that ancient religion yeah it's not too ancient
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.080]  it's like yeah you know yeah it's like 20 years out of date what are you you kidding
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.640]  I have like computers that still work that are that old like yeah I always yeah I always
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.960]  just had the vague sense just as a rough canology and whether it actually worked out or not
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.960]  but that let's say like in that scene on the Death Star where the guy is saying you know
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.600]  you're the last practitioner of that thing that at least the the age of the Empire and
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:34.620]  the age when the Jedi were either a dominant force missing or reduced to just a handful
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:39.920]  hidden around the galaxy was around the length of those men's ages like that guy was born
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.400]  in a world where the Jedi were already decimated yes you know like 35 40 years yeah you know
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.440]  because if it wasn't you know it's sort of like for what for like people like us like
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:56.000]  the the the world without TV like we know that there was a world without TV we believe
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.160]  in a world without TV but we don't we haven't experienced it which makes it because it predates
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.320]  our life you know our us being born it seems ancient or even black and white TV black and
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:11.160]  white TV seems ancient to me yeah it's intellectually fathomable but kind of visibly just you can't
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:15.220]  really picture it right right whereas if I was maybe 10 years older than black and white
[01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:21.040]  TV would just seem like something from my childhood exactly yeah and the other angle
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.440]  you can go to explain the chronology is the backwater thing where yeah these things were
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.400]  around but information is not evenly distributed and so if you are really far away from all
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:36.680]  the action on some remote planet maybe you're not interested in the history of the Republic
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.400]  or any sort of pangalactic government or anything like that and maybe you just you know like
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.440]  the Jedi story we heard samurai stories because Japan's not too far away and we had a war
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.200]  with them and we know about Japanese stuff and their culture came over here how much
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.760]  culture about maybe Tatooine they didn't get any culture about the Jedi and it still doesn't
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.400]  as as John said that all right well Ben is down the street he's purposely not mentioning
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.860]  it maybe that's part of his strategy of keeping an eye on Luke put him in a backwater where
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:05.000]  they've never even heard of the Jedi you can kind of explain it but once you get like Han
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.100]  Solo who's supposedly been jetting all over the galaxy and he's like I've never seen anything
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.840]  that made me think all-powerful for you never seen anything like you should have seen like
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.520]  movies of Jedi things with their mind and you'd be like all right well I guess that
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:21.340]  was a thing yeah and then in the new trilogy I mean again he's supposedly super super powerful
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.360]  but we see Anakin as a kid doing some things that would require the force you know that
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:32.040]  if just because the Jedi are decimated doesn't mean that human beings who have force related
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.560]  powers yeah you know that you wouldn't run into them with what we can only assume to
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:43.600]  be the wide variety of action that Han Solo has seen you know heretofore in his his adventures
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.880]  well I mean Anakin's whole thing was like he's got Jedi reflexes he's the only human
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.160]  who can podrace you could just be a child prodigy and have amazing reflexes at that
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.600]  point you don't necessarily have to you know he's not he's not moving salt shakers with
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.660]  his mind quite yet I just I bet I just think that if a seven-year-old is showing those
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.640]  type of abilities that Han Solo would have seen you know something a guy who could cheat
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:06.200]  at dice you know in a casino because he can yeah I mean there's no explanation explanation
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.920]  for Han not being so doubt I mean other than the fact that it works in the context of the
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.960]  original trilogy but as soon as you tack on the prequels with that timeline between them
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.680]  then all of a sudden everything in a new hope is just doesn't read as true yeah you have
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:25.180]  to be willfully stupid at that point yeah um I so I want to touch on some of the writing
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:31.520]  things that to me just clearly showed that it wasn't thought out in advance and I'm gonna
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.920]  say this though before I do that there's so many writing complaints that we can do and
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.480]  should do and I think it's fundamental to the prequels emptiness I'll say though I'll
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.880]  forgive Lucas for the those expositional problems like like Luke not knowing what a lightsaber
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.680]  is or the forces I'll forgive those completely because of the need to explain to us the audience
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.600]  what those things are and yes it was a little clumsy if you try to you know if you really
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:02.460]  think about it it it thinks a little clumsy but it you know I it's in hindsight though
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.240]  overall it was a good scene like I remember you know very fondly looking back on that
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.840]  scene in obi-wan's house where he you know gets the lightsaber and turns it on and hears
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.440]  about the Jedi in the first that scene is perfectly acceptable if the prequels don't
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.880]  exist it's perfect because he really wouldn't have known he's a farm boy how would you know
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.920]  about this love he's a farm boy shows up at the old man the old man shows him something
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.380]  from a box it's an ancient thing and it's it's exact it's it's a device yeah you get
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:28.400]  someone who's naive and then you have the wiser person explain to them and you really
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.120]  explain to the audience it works perfectly in the context of that story I think it would
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:36.400]  be a little bit more elegant if it was a little bit more and I hate to say it but a little
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:43.640]  bit more like the scene in a phantom menace where young Anakin asks if he's a Jedi because
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:48.600]  he's you know he sees his laser sword he doesn't even know the name lightsaber but it's like
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.760]  even if Luke had just said you know it just expressed some sort of I've heard of lightsabers
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.200]  but never believed I'd see well you wanted to be more mysterious than that like you don't
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:03.020]  want Neo to know about the matrix before I get like you want him to be a complete neophyte
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.180]  because he's got his arc is he's a farm boy who dreams something more and then his wider
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.720]  world opens up to him so I'm perfectly happy with him not knowing at all and the explanation
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.560]  as delivered by Alec Guinness but so laid-back and not going into a lot of detail like sure
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.340]  as hell not mentioning midichlorians it's like two or three sentences a vague it's the
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.080]  type of explanation you would get if this guy's like I've decided that I'm gonna bring
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.160]  you on board this thing but I can't explain it all to you now let me just give you the
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.720]  broad strokes and let's move on to the next scene because we gotta go to Mos Eisley right
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:37.000]  and it's a well you know Luke is our you know he's there for us we see yes we see that whole
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.680]  thing through Luke's eyes and up until that point in the movie you know it's actually
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.160]  it's not like this hybrid fantasy science fiction combo it's more just science fiction
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.180]  it's just spaceships and laser guns and then all of a sudden in that scene we're we're
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.040]  explained that it's also a little magic and that movie I knew hope is not force heavy
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.080]  like it's like all right lightsabers forest Jedi guest Vader's got one it's an excuse
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:07.080]  to have a sword fight but like really Lucas like it's only the mind I think it's only
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.800]  the mind trick that is that is magic you they don't even do the force move stuff that comes
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.120]  what I'm saying is like Luke what Luke dreams about is being a pilot like he wants to fly
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.380]  a spaceship and he's interested in the rebellion you know about the rebellion he's totally
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.600]  interested in the rebellion so he's like he's a liberal basically like he's against the
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:27.740]  embers for he's for the rebellion he just wants it big says friend has gone off into
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:32.620]  war to join the rebellion and he's totally into flying things and be like he's he's a
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:38.280]  young punk who you know wants to get off this stinking rock and do great things and none
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.400]  of that has anything to do with the force or swords or sword fighting or moving things
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.960]  with your mind or anything like this totally the second movie gets him into that and the
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.760]  first movie he's just like you know it's like a coming-of-age story and going off to the
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.200]  war and even though he does a little bit of force stuff like it's like Obi-Wan says taking
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.940]  your first step into a larger world he has but that larger world does not yet interest
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:01.200]  him and he doesn't realize the importance of it until more or less he sees Obi-Wan disappear
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.760]  in a puff of smoke and then starts talking to him through his you know he can hear him
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:09.180]  in his mind he's like maybe there's something to this force thing and that aspect of it
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:14.920]  I do think was loosely plotted out by Lucas where here in this first movie the force is
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.800]  really just for Vader and Obi-Wan and Luke gets a taste of it he gets a few drops on
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:26.200]  his tongue you know and it helps him it helps him have final victory in the movie like in
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.880]  the end his piloting skills are not enough and he has to you know use the force that's
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.080]  the whole big takeaway from and that's the climax movie but what has he done he's barely
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.600]  scratched the surface of like he didn't find anyone with lights there for the whole movie
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.480]  right he got shot in the butt by the little floaty ball but in the end it was all I mean
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.360]  this is why the movie resonated so much it was you know the the force stuff is like it's
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.560]  a little bit of ludditism of turn off your targeting computer but like you know the that
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.400]  things that are inside you your emotions and feelings and thoughts are that feel so powerful
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.320]  inside you can actually have an external manifestation manifestation of that power and it will lead
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.600]  you to victory and it'll be a good victory and the star will blow up and no one else
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.840]  could have made that shot and so on and so forth all right I think and I know this is
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.080]  it might be controversial I think and I think John you and I have even talked about this
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.200]  I think that when Lucas wrote Star Wars or what I call Star Wars the new hope episode
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.840]  four and I think he thought if this is a hit and I get to make the rest of the trilogy
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.320]  you know that was the whole thing I say I've got to make this first one and if it's successful
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:31.040]  holy shit then I can you know worry I can write and finish you know that's planned trilogy
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:37.640]  I think he wrote it with the idea that Luke was going to be the guy who gets the girl
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:42.160]  I think so yeah it's reasonable and the whole first movie completely supports that right
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:46.700]  I don't think there was any plan at all for Leia to be his sister no I think he did plan
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:50.040]  on Vader being his father I mean and there's the whole thing where Vader's I think the
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:55.360]  German word for father I think that might have been there although I'm still not even
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:01.720]  convinced of that because when obi-wan tells him that Vader he was killed by killed by
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:08.720]  Vader it it plays well in hindsight but I can't help but think that in from what we
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.880]  know of Lucas overall like he's if that's what he thought overall he would have overplayed
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.480]  it and it would have been like he killed your father so if you watch this any I just will
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.800]  actually as it happens I just watched that scene just before coming on this podcast and
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.920]  there's two ways you can take it one way if you look at it with hindsight it is acted
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:33.480]  perfectly to be like let me know he's thinking of like what he's gonna say and you know how
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.860]  is he gonna say is he knows he's gonna lie right in hindsight it can look like that the
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.760]  other way that the same performance from Alec Guinness can look is you don't want to tell
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:46.160]  kid what happened to his father especially his father died like oh don't ask me about
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.320]  your father I gotta tell you that you know he was killed by Darth Vader and it's unpleasant
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.880]  and the same performance reads like either one of those things reads on it perfectly
[01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:58.920]  obviously the one with hindsight you're like oh it's totally that performance but it could
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.480]  also just as easily be a little kid just asked me about his father and I know this father
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.840]  was killed he didn't he didn't die peacefully in his sleep he was killed by Darth Vader
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.260]  Darth Vader's a bad guy he's leading those people who are you know like it reads that
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.080]  way as well I don't know if Lucas told Alec Guinness by the way when Luke asks about what
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.260]  happened to his father you're going to be essentially lying even if I can't tell you
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.520]  what did happen to his father what you're going to tell him isn't the truth so play
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.800]  I get the feeling I get the feeling that Lucas made up Vader being his father in the second
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:35.720]  one and I get the feeling that he just went back in so many things in Jedi feel that he
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.200]  just went back to the well he made another Death Star it comes like that even as a kid
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.560]  I found that kind of boring but no but it makes it it makes a nice circle like I again
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.760]  I was thinking about a new hope when when uh when 3po is going to the oil bath and uh
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.320]  I forget Luke is talking to him or whatever and he's like you know I'm just a protocol
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.020]  droid and not very good at telling stories like throw away lines like that they get paid
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.800]  off two movies later I'll give you that one I agree I agree but I do think that he he
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:09.340]  shoehorned Leia into being part of the the Skywalker family in Jedi because I think he
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:14.600]  felt that he needed the reveal that was akin to the one in Empire but yeah but he did in
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.040]  Empire he said no there is another so he's got to pay off the is there is another I'm
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.400]  glad he didn't leave that dangling the fact that the the another that's true it's mostly
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.900]  immaterial unless they unless they build on that in episode seven or so but it's mostly
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.240]  no materials like basically says there's another which means that like basically that's there
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.840]  to let you know that Luke could conceivably die in Empire and he came pretty darn close
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.040]  to dying like to make you think guess what guys I'm willing to kill off a main character
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.300]  because there is another right and it just so happens that it turns out that he lives
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.440]  and in a Jedi way find out who the other is but it's mostly inconsequential because hey
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.320]  Luke is alive Luke again if Luke had died a Jedi then the other would be what we would
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.920]  be hanging our hat on for the future well I mean the concept the consequence is that
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:17:00.960]  it makes Luke go ballistic and ultimately defeat Vader through anger right yeah yeah
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.060]  I mean it was it was worked into the movie it's just like talk about making it up as
[01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:10.600]  you go along I'm willing to believe that like having Vader turn out to be his father fine
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.400]  that works but how many surprise familiar relationships are you allowed in a trilogy
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.940]  right by saying oh and guess what another main character is also related to you really
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.680]  is everybody related to me yeah it could have been it didn't have to be a sister it could
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.820]  have just been that Leia was the the other one yeah exactly late and untapped force
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:33.880]  power right and what's next we're gonna say Darth Vader made C-3PO come on it's ridiculous
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.040]  and actually he does yeah exactly that yeah let's not talk about that but he does he does
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.880]  like uh do the Vulcan mind chat with uh with Leia as her escaping best man yeah no there's
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:51.320]  the who the other is and uh the fact that they can have their relate that communication
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:55.620]  with each other is either they're related or they're both Jedi's or both and either
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.960]  one would be semi-plausible because there's plenty of movies that are like oh I just feel
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:03.960]  that my non-magical movies like I have some somehow a feeling that my my brother is in
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.460]  a terrible car you know people totally buy into that stuff especially in this movie we
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.960]  have established telepathic links between people even when one of them is dead like
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.480]  the first movie totally no Ben is in his ear saying you know use the force Luke or whatever
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:22.180]  so as soon as he's communicated telepathically with Leia like I guess she's the other see
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.340]  and I think and if you look remember the original posters and it's like the even the Star Wars
[01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.560]  logo is a little different and maybe even a lot different it's still got like the connected
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:37.800]  letters but it's like in a different almost like a pyramid shape and it's like there's
[01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:41.760]  it's a lot more stylized it doesn't I don't know that any of the characters quite look
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:47.520]  like likenesses of the actual actors but Luke is holding his lightsaber above his head his
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:55.580]  chest he's got his big chest coming out and Leia's wrapped around his leg it to me that
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:02.480]  that poster gets authorized because it's a tale of this boy from a farm which is what
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.480]  it ended up being who goes on this grand adventure and gets the girl well he rescues the princess
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:13.640]  he rescues her I swing across the canyon on a rope together like and she gives him a kiss
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:19.040]  for that for luck and then there's the famous kiss in on Hoth in right by that time you're
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.720]  doing actual romance and the first movie was so gentle it's like yeah even Disney even
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:27.080]  Disney movie has like Belle kissed the beast in the lips at the end there was nothing like
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.200]  it's Star Wars there's no kissing on the lips it's just like all kind of it's understood
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:37.600]  that Luke has saved the princess nothing is you know nothing is as sexual though as that
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.520]  poster right and because that was the way they did movie posters like you had to promise
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.740]  even if there's no actual sex in the movie you have to promise there's gonna be a guy
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.940]  there's gonna be a girl and the girl is gonna be a submissive princess who wraps herself
[01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.240]  around the hero's leg and the hero's chest is gonna be gigantic I mean Mark Hamill's
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:57.560]  chest is not gigantic but on those posters it's busting out of his white tunic you know
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:04.180]  it's the way they advertise things I'm looking at it now and I and if I'm correct and Han
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:09.600]  Han and Chewie I don't think are even in it it's you know there's a big Vader behind him
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:16.520]  but it's Han it's it's Luke and Leia and the droids yeah and it's a good call what they
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.480]  like if you're if you're gonna call an audible it's a good call it's the reason Empire is
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.480]  so great it's because after the first movie you've got you know the childhood fairy tale
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.280]  we're gonna save the princess Luke gets to swing across the canyon with her they all
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.260]  get medals at the end Leia gives them a special smile during the medal ceremony it's appropriate
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:37.640]  for like prepubescent boys who understand the concept of getting the girl or whatever
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:43.740]  but once you're about to make the second movie you say you know what you know Leia actually
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:48.360]  the bickering Leia did with Han is a better indication of a budding romantic relationship
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.080]  than anything that happened between Leia and Luke and that is a much more interesting relationship
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.280]  so why don't we go in that direction for Empire and they did and it was smart and again she
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.980]  doesn't have to be Luke's sister to do that because that that is the actual relationship
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:04.240]  with chemistry right well chemistry between Luke and Leia for the second movie to build
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.400]  yeah you could well I don't know about at the time when I first saw it probably not
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.080]  because I was very young but you can tell when he when she kisses Luke that it's basically
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.620]  just to get at Han right like it's it's got it's got it's got very little to do with kissing
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.180]  Luke and Luke is not ready to handle like Luke is like putting his hands behind his
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:29.000]  head going oh a girl kissed me it's like that's you know it's it's that's and Han is is you
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.320]  know yeah but he plays it cool he's like yeah take care kid like yeah well Luke is not Luke
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.320]  is as far as we know Luke hasn't even had a girlfriend here whereas Han is you know
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:44.960]  is worldly wise and yeah like he's wise there's not chemistry yeah he doesn't he's not even
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.680]  upset with Luke or anything he's just like okay well she wants basically he's resigned
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.000]  that she won that argument right you know it's got nothing to do with the kids he still
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.080]  knows it's the two of them and Luke is just a bystander that's that's exactly it that's
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:02.160]  you know that's the way he plays and Luke does not spend any part of Empire pining over
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.760]  Leia or thinking about Leia and as anyway except for a friend like when he's having
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.000]  these trances on Dagobah he's like oh Leia like in terms of his friends that he's gotta
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.960]  save Han Leia he's got to go save his friends he is not he's not hung up on Leia at all
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:22.520]  right speaking about uh sort of the beginning part of Empire what I loved uh because I you
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:28.720]  know after we decided we couldn't do this of course I watched them all over again um
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.920]  the story of Han in in in the first one ends with him basically turning around and saving
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:39.720]  the day right or at least helping Luke save the day um and then we come immediately into
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:45.040]  Empire Strikes Back and we keep building on that like as soon as he finds out that Luke
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.560]  is out in the cold he's willing to die to go get him like the the character progression
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.740]  starts exactly where it where it ended like Han had already decided that like no he's
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.420]  all in he's committed to saving like these people are his friends and he's going to go
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.920]  help them and we don't we don't but we don't repeat the arc you know we don't need to repeat
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:07.400]  the arc it's like immediately he's jumping on his tauntaun and seeing people in hell
[01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.840]  there's a continuation of the arc of like he's being chased because he's got a price
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.360]  on his head like we know there's there's that yeah but he but he but we don't see him being
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.840]  the scoundrel to his friends anymore like he's completely dedicated oh yeah no he goes
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:24.040]  out he goes out he goes out for Luke and when uh the Imperials attack the base he immediately
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:28.280]  goes to get Leia and try to tries to get her out like that's the first thing he does like
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.120]  there and we've had time removed because the the end of a new hope and the beginning of
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.040]  empire there's a substantial amount of time during which there's more like that they've
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.120]  been to war together so now they're essentially not just friends but war buddies yeah there's
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:46.440]  hijinks in there there's Ord Mandel well exactly but that to me is like the brilliant that's
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:50.780]  like Star Wars at its best is the Ord Mandel story where it's just they just mention it
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:57.000]  it's a cool sounding name uh you know something happened you know there's just this in in
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.700]  the in the quickest way possible simply through dialogue they just imply and it feels genuine
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:07.760]  that they've been through some shit in between the two movies and we haven't seen it yeah
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.080]  I always thought and it reminds you that bounty hunters exist in the universe which comes
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:17.320]  in later right and thereafter yeah all right I think I can't I could do a whole show just
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:21.940]  on empire because I think empire yeah I think empire is what what holds the whole thing
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:26.280]  together I think Star Wars was clearly you know the original one was a huge sensation
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:32.680]  it was the biggest pop cultural you know movie of the whole series nothing is ever going
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:37.120]  to top that but the one that makes it something that we're going to keep hoping for sequels
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:44.040]  that are good is empire I mean how when when else has there been a sequel that is you know
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:50.040]  as good or better than godfather 2 is the other godfather 2 aliens aliens here's the
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:55.500]  thing about maybe aliens but here's the thing about Star Wars versus empire uh empire took
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:25:00.160]  it to another level like it's not just because godfather 1 and godfather 2 are at the same
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.080]  level they're both the same kind of movie they're movies for adults they're serious
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.680]  they are they're they're aiming for the same type of things and the fact that godfather
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.000]  2 was just as good and some people might say better they're still the same because star
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.840]  wars a new hope is like kind of more of a kids movie again with the romance is not real
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:23.640]  romance it's very simplified it's very sort of fairy tale you know it it it aged right
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.200]  along with the kids and empire is like actually we're going to take this even more seriously
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.240]  and not innate everything is gritty you know tim burton's batman or dark knight or batman
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.040]  begins like everybody's got to be dark and gritty or whatever just say we're going to
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.880]  have real emotional stakes we're going to have relationships between adults that read
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:44.080]  as true to adults right so it will and kids will pick up on the fact that the relationship
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:49.920]  between han and leia is a more legitimate adult relationship than anything that that
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.040]  took place in a new hope and that's why it stands out it's like it's taking it to the
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:26:01.600]  next level yeah i loved your observation uh probably on the incomparable in fact i'm sure
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:08.260]  it was that um han and leia kiss on the falcon and then they get interrupted but when they
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:13.740]  end up in in cloud city and she's they're they're they're in that uh the suite that
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:19.440]  they've been hooked up on uh it's kind of i'd never thought of it before but you had
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:23.240]  the observation that it's clearly they slept together by that point because they're just
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.560]  they're demeanored together like they're so much more like relaxed around each other and
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.280]  a release of tension yeah yeah yeah they're just like pretty chill with each other and
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:35.080]  like yeah yeah the way they relate to each other is that finally so much more intimate
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:39.640]  will they won't they the answer was that they will and they did and now they can relate
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.680]  to each other directly without because they're so guarded with each other before kind of
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.600]  like you know they're trying to guard themselves but not reveal too much of themselves but
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.000]  show that they want to get together and like and eventually that settles down and they
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.600]  can finally relate to each other directly without sort of the artifice of like and it
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.080]  happens it happens off camera and all you see is like that just the familiarity and
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.320]  like the like he's they're still teasing each other but it's so much there's less tension
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.120]  going on you know up until then nothing that they've said to each other is actually what
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:19.800]  either one is actually feeling exactly right yeah except maybe uh the oh you uh you you
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:26.840]  do have your moments not many but you do have them yeah yeah yeah that was one of yeah the
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:31.120]  fact they slept together where they believe both me and dan moran as it often happens
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.440]  had the same thought at the same time in that podcast yeah but han's whole take up until
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.520]  then is i could take you and leave you and which isn't true he's obsessed and her angle
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.400]  is i'm not interested in you at all which is not true she's interested even though she
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:51.240]  knows she shouldn't be right like if there's a line that that is honest it's her uh i like
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:59.960]  nice men yeah i'm nice man i'm nice man but that is so basic that brings us to to me what
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:06.920]  was the great thing about empire was that it seemed as though george lucas recognized his weaknesses
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:13.560]  and recognized everything that would could have been improved in the first one and then did they
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:20.200]  either took action to rectify it or or delegated so for example stilted character dialogue guess
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:25.960]  what george lucas very creative at making stories create a brilliant seriously brilliant world
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:32.040]  builder probably i would argue the most brilliant cinematic world builder we've ever seen like you
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:37.560]  could argue that the lord of the rings is a more fully realized world but that's been something
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.840]  but that's a novel it's it's not cinema you know as a purely cinematic world i would say he's
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.640]  unparalleled guess what he can't write dialogue what was the harrison ford line uh george you
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:51.480]  can't say we can't you can write this but you can't say it yeah yeah you can write this but
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:59.000]  you can't say it so he brings in two great screenwriters larry casden who uh i guess yeah
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.800]  did raiders came first did great work on raiders uh which is a fantastic story and has fantastic
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:12.600]  dialogue and a fantastic relationship between harrison ford and uh marion yeah well larry
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.200]  casdon's like a legend right he's right yeah well and with the talk about legend the lee bracket
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:28.040]  right uh who wrote stuff for uh like humphrey bogart and uh um you know from that whole era
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:35.080]  from the 40s those 40s film noir which is great and that's what you know now that i'm older i
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:41.400]  mean obviously in 1981 when it came out i had not seen the maltese falcon uh you know i thought black
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.440]  and white movies were for you know old people but now that i have like a richer film vocabulary and
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:52.120]  i've seen movies like that that's what the empire strikes back crackles with crackles they threw
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:57.240]  away most of that script though like and the spirit of it still embodies it like but if i'm
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.960]  in the big empire making of empire book by uh what risen or something like that the big giant coffee
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:06.280]  table book about making of empire which is great i recommend everybody reading that made me feel
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:11.560]  like that lucas picked these people who are amazingly talented who'd work with before or new
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.520]  or you know like he picked he picked people who whose work he admired and then when they said about
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:21.000]  doing things either he was disengaged from it or if he was engaged the feeling that i got from him
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.800]  is like guys doesn't have to be that good like that he would be fine with it it was like that
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:29.960]  they were they wanted to make it the best it could possibly be and if it up to him he'd be like you
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:34.280]  guys don't need to just go home like what you've got is fine like for today yeah that's fine whereas
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.600]  the people actually involved in making the movie were just like we're gonna make this as good as
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.200]  we can possibly make it and they were arguing with each other about every little thing right down to
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.800]  the actors of harris and ford arguing about han's motivations and what he would say in the scene of
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:51.080]  like very collaborative very contentious aggressive filmmaking on the part of actually making the
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:56.920]  movie and that lucas would be like it's just it's just a kid's movie guys just chill like you don't
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:01.640]  it's not that like if it was if lucas was more involved he would not have been pressing people
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:05.400]  to and we see what happens when he did have the say over everything involved it's like what he
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:11.640]  cared about deeply was like the design of the ships and the computer graphics and stuff like
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.680]  that and what he cared less about was like dialogue story acting performances you know
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:23.480]  all that type of stuff uh so anyway i'll take a timeout for a sponsor break but anybody who's
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:28.520]  looking for some good older movies to watch would could do worse than some of the ones that lee
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:34.200]  bracket worked on the screenplay for um going backwards in time and just looking at her imdb
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:40.200]  credits some of the ones that i've seen that i know or stand out um the long goodbye from 1973
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:48.680]  that was uh a robert altman movie but to make a philip marlow detective story set in the 70s
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:56.840]  starring um uh what's his name the guy from oh elliot gold from uh young kids will know him
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:07.000]  from oceans 11 uh like a 70s take on a 40s film noir which was awesome uh probably my one of my
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.480]  favorite westerns ever made howard hawke's rio bravo you guys ever see rio bravo yeah
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.440]  uh oh my god it's one of the best movies i've ever seen dean allen or not dean allen dean
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:25.560]  martin plays an alcoholic uh sheriff you don't say it's him but it's actually to me like a pretty
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:32.120]  interesting take on alcoholism in a kid's uh action movie you know with john wayne as his boss
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:42.600]  great great great movie and uh the big sleep from 1946 with uh humphrey bogart and uh lauren bakal
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:47.400]  lauren yeah that's probably the one if you're only going to watch one of the ones i just
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:53.160]  listed watch the big sleep uh and i know you're right they didn't use a lot of large parts of
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.680]  her script but it definitely infused the the the dialogue of empire strikes back
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:06.680]  uh all right second sponsor let me thank our good friends at fracture you guys remember fracture
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:13.480]  they were here but they were sponsored to show a while back uh fracture is a service you send
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:19.160]  your photos to them and they print them directly on glass right how many of our photos never even
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:24.680]  get printed they're all we all we never look at them anywhere except uh eye photo and your your
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:30.840]  phone uh you don't get to hang them on your wall you want to start printing some more photos out
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:37.640]  go check out fracture they do this in an amazing way uh with fracture you send them your photos
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:43.000]  they print them directly on glass it's not like a piece of paper behind glass they have this i
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.320]  don't know how the hell they do it i've never seen anything else like it uh you send them your
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.360]  pictures they print them directly on glass it's almost like the effect like the whole thing like
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.240]  with iphones like where it used to look like you had a screen under the glass and then when they
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:01.480]  started fusing the screen closer to the touch you know to the surface it looks like the pixels are
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:05.800]  right on glass that's what fracture photos look like they look like pictures printed directly on
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:11.640]  glass the prints come with a foam back that's ready to mount right out of the box it's like a
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:17.080]  frame and you get desktop stand or something you can hang on the wall all in one right out of the
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:24.920]  box really clever packaging frankly um and it just looks like no other picture that i've ever seen
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.400]  uh it's a really cool gift uh just in time for the holidays
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:35.960]  hey they're the ones who booked this week but it is if you have future gifts to give out
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:40.280]  birthdays and stuff like that uh seriously fracture is great we do it all the time it is
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:45.000]  like the it's like just a go-to thing in my back pocket like mother's day just find a picture of my
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.360]  kid print a couple fractures for all the grandmothers in the family and boom there's a
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:56.040]  great gift here's where you go to find out more here's their website fracture me all one word
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:04.760]  fractureme.com and use this code it's just my last name gruber g-r-u-b-e-r and you can save 20
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:10.680]  percent they have a whole bunch of sizes ranging from really small square ones which are perfect
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:17.160]  for printing like instagrams that you want to save and print out to it's enormously big all sorts of
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:24.360]  sizes great great quality you won't regret it use the code gruber and you'll save 20 percent yeah
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:32.600]  and i know our friend marco uh uh uses fracture for his uh he makes fractures out of his app icons
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.080]  hanksman as well which i think is a nice idea yeah that's only useful if you come out with a new app
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.800]  every year like marco yeah and sell the old one yeah but it's a cool idea i like it yeah it is
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:49.640]  cool i've heard other people say that that they do that um empire we could go on and on about empire
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:54.600]  but it's there's almost no wasted exposition you're just like you said you're thrust back
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.480]  in this world it feels like yes some stuff has gone on but the characters are on this exact same
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:05.960]  arc that they were before uh i always use this word i and to me it epitomizes the sense of
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:12.440]  camaraderie between the heroes of the original trilogy it's this palpable sense of camaraderie
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:19.400]  which i think is so hard to capture in movies i feel like tv shows do a better job of it because
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.360]  can do a better job of it because they have so much more time right if you watch madman for
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:30.280]  six seasons there's a camaraderie between roger and don because they've been through so much
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:38.600]  together because we've seen them through you know i don't know 140 hours of television whereas it
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.400]  for star wars to have gotten to this palpable sense of camaraderie between these characters
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:52.680]  that you truly believe after just you know two hours and 15 minutes of of film so far when han
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.960]  says you know they say you're never going to survive the night and he goes well then i'll
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:00.600]  see you in hell and he goes out you just believe it i believed it as a kid i'd still it chokes me
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:04.920]  up i get a lump in my throat when i when he does that when i watch that because i feel to me like
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:10.280]  it's the it's not just serving the story it's that's what this guy would do yeah of course
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:15.080]  he's going of course he's like what else is he going to do and the way you build that camaraderie
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:22.840]  is you have to have the the people the ensemble cast you have to have them uh not sort of come
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.880]  together and just be friends from the beginning and go that you need to have them be like at odds
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:33.400]  over certain things and have them butt heads about those things and come not so much resolve those
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.960]  things but come to an understanding about those things whatever things they disagree on uh i'm
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:42.120]  totally into the force and think it's great you think it's uh it's hokey i'm with the rebellion
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:48.040]  you're not so sure about it uh i you know i'm a hothead i'm more calm you know like just whatever
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:53.320]  thing whatever personality traits that that you know don't mesh you have to show them clashing
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.720]  and then you have to show that they through the other things become more important they they come
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.320]  to an understanding about those differences and become friends then you also need to have them
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.960]  go through things like like john said about madmen you have to have them go through the moment where
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.640]  they succeed in business fail in business where what's one person is vulnerable because he's
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.120]  drunk and says something the other person to have one or two true moments between people and have
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.760]  like you could even have on a tv series you could have a misunderstanding or betrayal that
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:23.480]  eventually you know they they figure out how to work out like you have so much more time to have
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.560]  those things but in star wars with the ensemble cast in the first movie you throw these guys
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.680]  together they don't know what to make of each other they've probably never seen anybody like
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.000]  each other and there's other characters in the mix and that you know that obi-wan is there and
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.840]  and han is just you know gonna do a job but you know it kind of feels for these people and the
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:45.320]  old guy's weird and he dies and they're both there when the old guy dies like you have to have that
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:49.160]  right i think the problem with a lot of ensemble movies the more modern ones is you throw together
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:54.280]  this group of attractive personable well-adjusted smart witty people and they just kind of walk
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.760]  parallel to each other side by side through the plot and that does not build camaraderie
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.520]  right yeah like han it's very clear because i just watched a new hope recently and it's very clear
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.920]  huh han when he first meets them he just doesn't even believe him he doesn't believe he doesn't
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:13.880]  know what the hell kind of trouble they're in but he it's just his his cynical self thinks whatever
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.960]  problem whatever it is they want me to take them to alderaan for it's no big deal they're telling
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.800]  me it's the empire i trust me i've seen trouble with the empire this is bullshit yeah he doesn't
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.680]  believe i'm gonna until the two starters show up and he's like whoa okay i actually didn't expect
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:32.200]  this you know in the cantina all he's thinking about is ripping them off right and vastly
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.120]  overcharging them as i pointed out on the uh the um couple episode about empire so han is doing the
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:42.520]  thing where he's talking to them and you know negotiating the price and luke is being not a
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.000]  good negotiator and obi-wan's trying to you know tell him to calm down work it out right they both
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.240]  leave the table what you're left with at that point i think at that point you had seen han
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.280]  i forgot if you've seen him with greedo or not yeah but anyway you saw han dealing with these
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:59.720]  guys as like i've got a fast shipper or whatever as soon as they leave the table he talks to chewy
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:04.120]  person to person with his true self these guys must really be desperate and at that point when
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:08.520]  you see him talking to chewy with his true self you realize this guy's not such a hard ass right
[01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:13.320]  right he is he's he clearly cares for for chewy they have a real relationship with each other he
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.560]  doesn't talk to chewy like hired help he doesn't bluff you have this bluster and everything with
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.400]  chewy so you know that sort of like there's a heart of gold inside this scoundrel so that's
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.760]  set up from the very beginning uh and that's what that's how it works out it's not like this guy is
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.720]  you know a hard ass and then suddenly he turns over and you leave the whole movie he is he has
[01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:36.600]  this conflict about i have to show that i'm tough on the outside but on the inside uh i am i'm a
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:41.640]  sensitive soul there's a great and also go ahead john well just also that the the sense that he's
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:46.280]  in some financial trouble to some bad you know right some bad people yeah that's it he's scared
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.520]  about it like yeah yeah greedo comes almost immediately after this after the yeah like
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:56.680]  the storm took to show up and then the next time we visit han uh beat us there there's a great
[01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:00.280]  scene like that he does the indie the indie thing in that scene where it's like don't have it with
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:04.520]  me that's kind of the sarcasm like indiana jones and han solo blended a lot in my mind as a kid
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.640]  because there's a lot of crossover in terms of harrison for it playing the kind of uh you know
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.320]  going to talk his way out of a jam type of thing like he'll fight his way out of a jam and he'll
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:17.240]  talk his way out of jam and he's able to do both and he'll switch between them based on the needs
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.520]  of the situation so eventually he doesn't have to shoot greedo but he tries to talk his way out of
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:25.320]  it first and if that doesn't work he's setting up his shooting the way yeah and i think what so i'm
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:29.880]  getting my own self off point but i think that's why it's okay that that han shoots first is that
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:35.880]  he really did try to get out of that without any trouble and only when it became like really clear
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:40.680]  that greedo was just going to shoot him and as palm storm say that sets up his moral journey
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.280]  in like that he is slightly more amoral the beginning of the movie because he's like i just
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:49.320]  care about he's trying to he's trying to put up a front that says i'm tough i only care about
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.560]  myself it's not true but that's the front he's trying to put up see you later i don't care about
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:57.720]  your rebellion he can't actually stick to that but he's totally willing to shoot first because
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:01.560]  that's what a tough guy he's he's play acting the tough guy that he wishes he was he's cut
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.760]  yeah he paints himself into a corner by being a tough guy and then it has to shoot the guy
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:09.160]  and so when he shoots greedo like greedo is scum and like indy would you know indy shoots the guy
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:12.120]  with the sword in the street yeah you don't yeah you don't feel you don't feel bad there's a little
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.960]  bit of a hard ass because he's survived this long doing this job exactly i think there's one sorry
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:21.800]  wait just two seconds there's one scene in empire that i think really speaks to this uh aspect of
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.000]  han which is he's already saved luke and luke's being rehabilitated in that and backed a tank and
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.960]  luke is about to go out in this snow speeder to uh you know try to slow down the the imperial assault
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.360]  um meanwhile han is on top of the falcon trying to patch it back up and uh luke says goodbye to
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:48.040]  chewy and chewy gives him a big hug uh and then there's just no words spoken between between han
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:55.880]  and luke they just kind of smile at each other and nod and it's still it's it's um luke kind of
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:03.160]  accepting han's uh tough guy outer outer shell like you can't say it like they can't actually
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.120]  say anything but there's there's just such a good connection between them then that i love it i love
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.080]  that there was an intentional choice not to provide any dialogue there because i think
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.120]  anything you could have said would have just ruined it well he stops him when he's walking
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:20.680]  away like luke was walking away it's like well i've got my hug from chewy i'm gonna walk away
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:25.320]  and then han basically stops him by yelling hey but then after after he's gotten his attention
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.800]  that doesn't need to be a big you know exactly it's kind of that's a macho they just they just
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.920]  not but it's not even that macho it's more like i think there is a line there i don't it could be
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:39.000]  but it's like the line is not the line is not what they would say the line is not what george
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.760]  lucas would write for them which is take care out there because you are a good friend and i like you
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.480]  yes yeah it's it's something like take these or something it's maybe good luck but it's so
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:52.040]  it's so minimal but the way that they're communicating it's not a tough guy thing it's
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:57.720]  more of um like a good friend thing do you know what i mean it's not like yeah like fist bump
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:03.160]  it's not that it's it's the it's caring there's a slight reveal of like bringing down that wall
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:08.520]  ever so slightly exactly they are communicating without that wall being in the way but if people
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:11.560]  looking on the outside they don't see it's still a little bit of a macho thing because you can't
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:17.560]  show your emotions yes i take that but it's yes but and it's an interesting contrast with chewy
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:24.360]  who is i think the actual toughest of the heroes and you know the one with the boars temper and
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:28.840]  he's the one who just lets the hug fly oh he's he's in touch with his emotions when the right
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.880]  yeah he really doors close he wails because his friend is out there he is right he's much more
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.960]  able he's much more in touch with his emotions does not feel the need to tamp them down like
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:41.960]  macho right right he always lets his emotions whatever finds out
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:51.400]  um i was just going to say to me circling all the way back to earlier in the show when i said that
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:57.080]  i found indy four more disappointing than phantom menace i agree with your assessment that the
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:03.000]  phantom menace had more the hope that it would be good was bigger than the hope that indy would be
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.600]  good my thought my my line of thinking on that was simply though that spielberg is still a very
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:13.560]  talented filmmaker and i thought that meant you know there was a good chance it could still be
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.360]  a good movie whereas by the time phantom menace came out because of the special editions i was
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:24.600]  already so deeply pessimistic because almost everything i would say like nine out of every
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.800]  ten changes in the special editions was for the worse yeah and i just made me think this man george
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:36.760]  lucas has lost his fucking mind and now he's going to make a whole movie and i it to me everything
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.000]  that i thought would go wrong because of the special edition to the original trilogy was
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:46.360]  exactly what went wrong with the whole original trilogy so i will say this about empire strikes
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:51.560]  back it is the only one that survived being special editioned and i think came out better
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:56.600]  for it in many ways yeah i think the changes they made to empire and special edition were pointless
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:46:01.960]  they did not need to be made but because empire was so so perfect right so perfect like what can
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.760]  you do to it like he had to fight to even find things to put in like well when spader leaves
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:10.200]  cloud city how does he get back to his star destroyer we should see that so wait that's
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.880]  stupid but that's the running level of crap that is that is stupid but the running around in the
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.520]  hallways of cloud city makes it look nicer because you can see i kind of like when it was all white
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.760]  but that that's was lucas's whole thing is like what could i not do because of budget or technology
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:26.680]  or time or both like well i couldn't have things through the windows i had to paint them all white
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.200]  so i'll put stuff in the windows i didn't like the stuff in the windows i liked it being all white
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:34.040]  when i was a kid i didn't feel like hey why are the walls opaque i felt like this is a weird
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:39.000]  futuristic looking set where everything is white and when they changed it it jumped out to me and
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.240]  sure but it didn't make it worse it was it was the movie that didn't get worse for being special
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:46.520]  edition it didn't get a pretty because who cares about that like it's minor point like oh we get to
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.520]  see them fly into cloud city it doesn't fit in with the rest of the movie it sticks out you don't
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.080]  need it but like there was so little they had to do like they weren't inserting entire new musical
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.560]  numbers for example and they weren't you know they weren't altering major plot points like having
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:05.960]  grido shoot it at han like there was nothing they didn't load up 20 more ad ads in the in the hoth
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.480]  battlefield right there's like they're like oh i wish i could have had more things going on in
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:13.320]  the hoth battle no the amount of things in the hoth battle scene was appropriate it was fine like
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.520]  you don't need to have oh let's put a bunch of things in the background too and then we have a
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:21.080]  whole other section where we fly around like it didn't need to be there yeah they cleaned up the
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.840]  mat lines they added a few things here and there they showed the wamper arm getting chopped off
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:29.560]  here's the thing that annoys me with that is i don't know if you guys remember but they redid
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.720]  the mat lines so it wasn't called special edition but they did a cleaned up effects version of it i
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.840]  don't remember what release it was for maybe it was for like vhs or maybe like but they they he
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:44.120]  did go back and clean up a lot of the worst of the optical matting and that was the approach like
[01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:47.800]  that's why i kind of had high hopes for special editions because it was kind of like oh it's going
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:51.560]  to be more of that stuff it's going to be like things that were limitations of technology at
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.320]  the time where the mat lines were super annoying or when there was something just clean that i
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.960]  don't know if you remember but in the snow speeders used to be able to see through the
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:03.080]  cockpit into the yeah yeah slightly translucent and you oh yeah make that if you can make it opaque
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.160]  now fine because that's you feel like that's not changing the movie and it's a special edition and
[01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:11.880]  it's like cleaned up but it's not like insert entirely new footage yeah yeah and i i remember
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:17.400]  and i believe it too as i've read that uh with the mat lines on the spaceships like in the dog
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:23.160]  fighting in a new hope when it was theatrically shown originally they might you might have been
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:27.560]  able to squint and see them but just because of the nature between projecting versus the home
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:32.200]  video transfer they were nowhere near as noticeable a lot of it was really just that it was that the
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:38.280]  first home video transfer was too light they they blew out the blacks whereas everything looked it
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:42.120]  was a lot richer black it wasn't like wow i don't remember seeing those lines around the tie
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.400]  theater fighters when i was a kid well that's because you didn't really see them yeah i'd buy
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:52.120]  that yeah um but anyway that was my thing is i and to me nothing epitomizes it more than the
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.760]  han shooting first and i know it's a cliche i know that it's like a super popular t-shirt you know
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:02.920]  han shot first but i feel like it's one of those things that it it's a cliche because it really
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:08.280]  does it it's a way to just put your finger on everything that's wrong with the special editions
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.520]  because it seems to me it always and this is the way i put it it's almost as though like
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:19.240]  if george lucas had sold star wars to disney in 93 and then disney did the exact same things
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.680]  you'd be like oh my god this corporation doesn't know jack shit it's like they don't even understand
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:30.200]  star wars and they're ruining this great thing it's almost mind-boggling that it was all done
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.360]  by the guy who made it well it's not mind-boggling it makes sense to me because the guy who made it
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.520]  got older it's the same thing that happened with the walkie-talkies in et it's like both people
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.400]  are like i'm i'm very well known for this famous movie now i'm an older person and when i go back
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.400]  and look at the movie that i made when i was a younger man i i feel differently about it and if
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.520]  i was making it today i would make it differently and i feel it's it's too harsh for for han to shoot
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.720]  first because hana is a sympathetic character and you start thinking of the children and i'm
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:00.840]  a father now or whatever and like the whole lesson from this is fine then make a different movie now
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:06.040]  this is the movie you made when you were you when you were you know a young man and this is a movie
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:10.200]  made by a young man and when you go back and change that like that is the worst sin of the
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:14.440]  movies is like i know that you have changed if you have changed make new art that expresses where you
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.840]  are today but don't and spielberg the fact that his contemporary spielberg did the same thing
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.240]  with et oh it's too upsetting that the people chasing after et have shotguns put a walkie
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:27.320]  talkie in there that's how you feel now as a 50 60 year old man it's fine but you can't go back
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.440]  and change the thing you made when you were a young man like didn't he go back and change that
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.520]  back to guns yeah i mean he was he was guilted into it because he's also you know less stubborn
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:39.640]  than george and yeah he's like yeah it's the same impulse because the people who made the movies
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:44.360]  got older and they still had the creative control to say you know what i want to make a new version
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:48.440]  of this movie that better reflects who i am today and it's like no make make a new movie for who you
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:52.280]  are today that's the movie you made then when you were a different person and it was a valid thing
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:56.760]  to be i i agree with both of you i think we're saying the same thing which is that you know
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.680]  you would have to write an entirely different scene to not have him shoot first because the
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:07.400]  thing if you if you've seen the film even once you can see that that he tries to talk his way
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:11.720]  out of it he realizes he doesn't and there is no way out for him other than to shoot credo
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:15.560]  credo is going to kill him right yeah over my dead body yeah that's the idea i mean and the
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:20.440]  thing is he's he's prepping like he's he is a kg person he is prepping for that the whole time he's
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.280]  like he's not going to say oh after i fail to talk myself out of it then think of a plan b plan b is
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.480]  already ready plan b has to already be ready because that's how he lives this long in his
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:33.560]  business it feels like a change that was mandated by like disney corporate you know like we we can't
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:39.160]  have a hero shoot first this has disney corporate barely can be bothered to take out the blackface
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:42.840]  in their old movies so i think they would have just left the shooting first like that's fine
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:48.440]  well i'm just upset about i'm just saying no it feels like somebody outside the film who hadn't
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:53.400]  even seen it is just holding up a check lock a checklist that says the heroes can't do this it
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.480]  feels like it feels like somebody from like the what is that thing the uh something parents
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:01.000]  association people always write to the fcc to complain about cursing and stuff it's like
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  sort of like an old person who's like oh kids these days and they're cursing and baggy pants
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.360]  and we really need to quilting this up and like it's that type of that type of idea that older
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.800]  people who are uncomfortable with things that younger people think are cool like because you
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.840]  know it's just it's just too harsh and if that character feels like han solo is is a lovable
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.840]  likable good character and he would never do something that bad whereas a younger filmmaker
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:30.520]  or anybody with more artistic integrity to say is good people do bad things people grow the same
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:34.840]  reason you know that he grew he should have been able to say this is what han was like when he was
[01:52:34.840 --> 01:52:40.600]  younger and less wise and you know and when i made the movie that's the character i made and now han
[01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:44.120]  is older and more wise and kinder and he has changed but you can't retroactively go back and
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:47.720]  make yourself it's like retroactively going back in your own life and making yourself not do stupid
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:53.320]  things when you're a teenager that's part of who you are we haven't spoken much about return of
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:53:01.320]  the jedi yet just the opening where luke you know it's sort of you know vaguely touching the line on
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:09.000]  maybe what a jedi would do in terms of the dark side so that movie that movie i think the more i
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.200]  watch it as i get older the more i like it really yeah i don't love it and it's nowhere near it
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:18.840]  doesn't make me anywhere near as happy as star wars or a empire does but i almost feel like i
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:25.400]  don't know how else i don't he has the trilogy yeah okay well so i put it i put it above star
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:31.240]  wars for me just because i really like it is a it is a more it's like so empire took took it up to
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:37.160]  the next level say here's a movie that's appreciated for all ages it has sophisticated story emotion
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:41.720]  things for adults in it and also kids will love it so that brought it up to the adult level jedi
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:45.400]  brought things back down a little bit with the ewok business but i feel like the culmination
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:49.720]  of the arc how this story ends him at the whole angle of like luke doing something that movie
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:55.720]  heroes never do which is you know pacifism is the victory like that never happened pacifists are
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:01.560]  wimps nobody wants a pacifist you want john mcclain to shoot the guy you want you want the cop who was
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:06.120]  guilty about shooting and drop drop him off drop him off the roof right yeah and you want the cop
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.960]  who felt bad who couldn't pick up his gun again because he accidentally shot that kid to get his
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.600]  gun back and say now i'm confident enough that i can shoot people again like pacifism never wins
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.640]  can you think of it any other movie anywhere where pacifism leads to victory again it's a kind of a
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:25.080]  job because vader vader does a thing maybe gandhi like for us you know you gotta think pretty deep
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:31.880]  down like that that is the struggle at the end that it is it is a sophisticated struggle an
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:37.560]  emotional struggle between luke not giving into his anger and fighting fighting uh vader and in
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.560]  the moment when when luke is winning the fight which is what you want the good guy to do in most
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.560]  movies kids are rooting for the guy beat the bad guy good guy beat the bad guy good guy may be down
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:48.600]  for the count good guy may be on the ropes but he's gonna come back and he's strong and he's
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:54.040]  gonna beat the bad guy that's the when that's happening in jedi that's the bet you're like no
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:57.960]  luke don't do that like you're to bring little kids along on that journey because all little
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:01.880]  kids want is the good guy to beat the bad guy to bring little kids along to the point where they
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:07.080]  are sad when the good guy is beating the bad guy i think it's a nice message i think it's a message
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.080]  that is never ever seen and i think the sophistication of that culmination yes they do
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:16.600]  blow up the death star again but the sophistication of the resolution of the luke vader story elevates
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:22.200]  the rest of that movie silly ewoks and all okay so i i totally agree with you in terms of uh
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.840]  luke's arc and yes that is the most satisfying thing and it's ultimately it redeems
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.320]  vader and and luke and and the space battle is good too oh yes oh my god it's a good space battle
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:38.920]  they don't make space battles like that yeah it's not just a bunch of ships flying around you care
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:42.680]  about lando by that point because you know him you care that he's flying someone else's ship
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:47.320]  right you care like the the three fronts thing people down on the planet people in the space
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:52.440]  station luke and the death star the coordination between those three lines of action is i think
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.320]  very well done i totally tempted to do in many other movies i think is you know it's in a modern
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.760]  device it's like oh we see that all the time the multiple lines of action culminating around one
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.960]  thing but this was an early occurrence and i think the balance between those three plot lines is just
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.480]  very nice so sometimes when they're on the ewok planet you're not that interested but
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.560]  at least it's all connected in a way that you understand and in a way that sure but what i
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:18.440]  don't like about it is um sorry john i think i cut you off but just well i was just gonna say that it
[01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:23.240]  makes sense not scientifically not like if you really try to think it through but if you just
[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:28.120]  go with the flow of star wars level logic it makes sense that all three things are simultaneous
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.920]  right yeah i mean just as a narrative and that they're they're relying on each other like this
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:37.080]  this this cast that we've come to know and they've they've been with each other their ensemble cast
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.680]  their friends they are spread out to do different missions for this final battle here and they're
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.240]  all relying on each other if han doesn't get that shield down they can't do the attack and if luke
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:52.200]  doesn't defeat the emperor inside there it doesn't matter because you know if he gets turned then
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:55.400]  they could blow up the star but then they have a problem anyway because the emperor will survive
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:59.560]  the only person who kills the emperor is vader so all they're all depending on each other and
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.840]  they're all leverage of each other like the emperor saying oh your friends out there you
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:07.400]  think they're we know about their plan they're screwed like it all it all connects nicely so i
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.440]  so i completely agree with you that i guess the the last third or at least the second half of that
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:18.920]  movie is is great uh we've got akbar he's amazing the the ship battle is great uh the surprise
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:24.360]  appearance of the like the bulk of the imperial fleet amazing the shield being up and all of
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.400]  those ships having to dodge amazing everything's great i love it and and you're totally right
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:36.600]  about everything coming together jedi for me starts out with the world's most inane
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.840]  higgledy-piggledy plan of like what the hell are you doing so you give you give the droids
[01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:51.160]  to java and you've got lando embedded and that made sense to me then you hand over
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:57.240]  but then wait then you hand over chubaka and then you try to get hand solely released
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.480]  but so here's the hand but chubaka is already in the thing and then when it comes down to it
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:08.280]  you you thought you were going to get dragged over a star like pit so that r2d2 would be serving
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.800]  drinks and jettison at like a lightsaber to you so you could not as none of it makes sense it is the
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:18.680]  stupidest plan they had no they're outgunned right because the people are going after han
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.680]  it's not the entire rebellion the entire rebellion is not coming down tatami no no no it's just it's
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:27.160]  just his friends right and so they a frontal assault is not going to work sure so they seem
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:31.880]  to have planned a b c and d so they have a lot of things going on here they have people embedded
[01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:37.160]  there they have the droids luke goes there like he's planning you know he's probably his primary
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:40.360]  plan is probably you know talk his way maybe we can get maybe we can get him out with these guys
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:43.640]  who are embedded if they can't send in luke but don't send in luke with his lightsaber because
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:48.360]  if luke gets screwed we need to have his lightsaber available so smuggle that into r2 right it's a lot
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:52.840]  of contingency plans and basically all their contingencies needed to be there because
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:58.760]  everything goes wrong and they're at the brink of death and their final contingency was luke can
[01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:02.120]  get out of this as long as he has his lightsaber we do have his lightsaber like yeah i don't see
[01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:06.440]  them as contingencies yeah so much as like we're going to set up a bunch of things that may be
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.480]  useful and maybe it'll all work out like but that's a good opening scene it's like a good
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.720]  bond opening scene it's like yeah that's exactly it's contrived it's silly it goes on a lot longer
[01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:19.000]  than a bond opening scene it is a little bit contrived but you get to see first of all you've
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.280]  got to resolve the han angle and get that out of the way for the rest of the movie yeah and second
[01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:27.560]  of all it's it's like a a series of fun action set pieces it's it's like it's you know three
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:32.600]  bond ones you've got the rancor you've got the the the sarlacc pit uh and then you've got a lot
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.840]  of like intrigue with people in this guy bob bobber fair sadly sorry john i keep cutting you off
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:43.800]  well the only star wars movie that doesn't have any scenes on tattooing empire yeah right and
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:48.200]  here they are back on tattooing and instead of feeling at that time because at that point
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:54.680]  50 of all star wars movies had scenes on tattooing just you know half just the one here it is it it
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:59.960]  felt like a you know he started on tattooing he didn't know shit about the force now he's back on
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:05.560]  tattooing and he's a jedi and it felt like a close another loop you're not just closing the loop on
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:12.840]  han being kidnapped and frozen in carbonite you're closing the loop on luke's uh you know childhood
[02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:17.240]  and my and that sets up the rest of the arc of the movie though because he you saw him at the
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:22.040]  end of empire and he is defeated his hand is cut off he's a mess emotionally he just found out
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:26.520]  very his father he is at his low you see him in jedi you're like who is this guy because the last
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:30.920]  time i saw him he was drenched in sweat with his hand cut off and like i'm like crap now this guy
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.800]  is confidently strolling into here and strangling people everything yeah but he's traveling that's
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.960]  that's the best company going in and he's like super powerful like wow luke is super powerful i
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.880]  guess his his arc is done and you find out his arc is not done because what he's got to deal with
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:47.480]  now is oh so you think you're the master of the force everything you don't even know what the
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:52.360]  actual battle is against your nature of not using your newfound power is for evil and that is the
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:56.520]  actual battle and that's why he goes back to you and he's like oh you think you're a jedi no you
[02:00:56.520 --> 02:01:00.520]  have to face vader why does he have to face vader it's not like some trial like oh you have to the
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:03.800]  understanding of me as a kid is like you have to face vader because when you beat him that shows
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.400]  you're the best guy because the best is the guy but no you have to face vader because you have to
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:11.800]  you have to deal with the whole dark side angle like remember your failure in the cave you have
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.960]  to face vader to show that you really do on that you really are on the white side of the force and
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.160]  not the dark side the only way to do that is to test yourself against someone that you totally
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:26.920]  want to kill and not do it right i agree with you guy that it logically probably should have just
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:31.560]  gone in with the lights yeah you know that the whole idea that instead of going in with the
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:36.680]  lightsaber i'll smuggle it in r2 and i'll just assume that if and when i really need it he'll be
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.760]  he'll be in shooting but he can't go with the lightsaber because if he's got to kill every man
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.280]  woman and child in java's palace it's not like he's gonna run race out of there with a gigantic
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:50.920]  carbon but he grabbed somebody's gun and tries to blast jab in the face oh that is not that is not
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:56.120]  jedi stuff that is he's improvising at that point because it's like he's trying to shoot an unknown
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:00.520]  guy in the face that is he's trying to negotiate his way out of the thing and they're like oh
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:04.120]  actually we're gonna send you into the pit and he tries to use the force to get out of it it's like
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:09.000]  things don't go well for him and isn't isn't that the first time in the movies we've because we you
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:15.880]  know the whole the whole original trilogy is relatively light on jedi action you know yeah
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.920]  it's the first time we've seen the jedi mind trick not work on somebody
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.240]  and that's where we learned that it only works on weak-minded force well no actually i think
[02:02:25.240 --> 02:02:30.520]  kenobi says it the force can have a powerful influence on the weak minders yeah i mean the
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.040]  original trilogy is really good at paying off things in ways that movies are not patient about
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:39.640]  now movies they have something in the beginning of the movie and they're going to pay it off by
[02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:43.000]  the end of the movie very rarely do you have something in one movie and pay off in a second
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.240]  movie and the the star wars trilogy has to take tons of things in the first movie that do not get
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:51.080]  paid off until two movies later which almost nobody has the guts to do anymore except for
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:55.320]  maybe like the big marvel arcs now that they have i mean but even that is like you're much more
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:58.920]  assured like they set up so much stuff in a new hope even jabba the hud himself is set up in a
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:02.280]  new hope would have been in the movie if they had the time or budget they didn't put him in the
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:07.960]  second movie he's in the third movie right yeah pay off that the debt that we've from we first
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:13.240]  seen we meet han solo 40 minutes into a new hope we don't pay it off until the third movie but he
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:16.280]  and i think that's alluded to an empire right like you've got to assume that the guy i know
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.400]  mandel is sent by jabba yeah no they say that yeah that's a death what does he say the general says
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.760]  like a death sentence yeah but i don't know they mentioned not an easy thing to live yeah they
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:31.320]  don't mention jabba by name but it's clearly yeah um and i think luke's idea that hey i'll try the
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:36.920]  jedi mind trick on it maybe this would be easy it would not have been dissatisfied if jabba was like
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:41.400]  okay yeah you have to end up you have to end up puncturing luke's confidence because he comes in
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.320]  as a star-coated figure who could this be and like he works and he's super confident you will give
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:49.800]  han solo to me and like gradually things fall apart well he gets comes out he's like how we doing you
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:55.640]  know same as usual is that bad huh like at that point like his his confidence in buster has been
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.800]  pierced and he's back to the old likable luke that who's like well he's more powerful now
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:04.120]  but things really aren't going well anyway well because he does get past the butler with that uh
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.320]  the jedi mind trick right and that's what sets up jabber to be like oh you fool you idiot like
[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:15.720]  you know yeah i gotta get higher better help you know yeah yeah his his twisty-headed consigliere
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:21.000]  yeah i'm sure there's a name and people are yelling at us right now but whatever my only
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.120]  problem with the opening scene which i agree pace wise even more than the battle at hoth which is
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:31.000]  almost more of like an opening act because it involves everything from luke you know getting
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:37.640]  captured by the wampa and han rescuing him to the whole battle that to me that the the the jabba
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:43.000]  scene pace wise feels like a blonde opening yeah thing um my only problem with that whole bit is
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:49.720]  the ignominious way that boba fett yeah no no it's not good it's not let's just not talk about it
[02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:54.280]  it's a sign of things to come yeah i don't know how you could do that what i think they do give
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:05:00.520]  them a wilhelm which is a little nod of respect but other than that well yeah i don't i just
[02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:07.320]  don't understand you know they knew they knew how cool that guy was they knew how cool there's
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:11.160]  why would you there's a lot of a lot more slapstick in jedi there's a lot more humor
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:15.160]  and slapstick stuff which i think for the most part works but the fact that boba fett gets
[02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:19.720]  wrapped up in a slapstick joke and that ends up being his death is a shame he's the only guy that
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:25.640]  can go toe to toe with the jedi and he looks like he's gonna win like it yeah and normally he's
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:30.520]  crafty and waiting for his moment like he's established as uh not the toughest bounty hunter
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:35.080]  but the smartest the street exactly an empire that establishes his character and he doesn't
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:42.360]  even get taken out by purpose he gets taken out by well like yeah like a blind hand solo he either
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:46.840]  should not have been there at all and just leave you know he's not there or he should have gotten
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:50.920]  away well i mean i'm okay with luke cutting his gun in half because like well you're up against
[02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:56.840]  a jedi yeah that that can happen i'm not okay with the way he died that's garbage um but they
[02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:01.000]  made him even worse by having him like basically be all into that musical scene that they added
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.480]  like they just keep making bomb of it one more sad well they did in the original run he just
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:11.880]  gives the little nod to the the sexy girl dancer which is totally a thing of course yeah that that's
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:19.240]  badass but yeah you know and let's not even get into jango fit in the whole god what a waste of
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:25.320]  a character well i you know and the only other thing i'll say about return of the jedi is that
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:31.960]  to me the weak spot is the whole thing on uh the the end or moon that third moon event like the
[02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:37.400]  whole the middle bit with the ewoks yeah it just doesn't live up and it's it's partly just that
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:42.600]  the whole ewok thing was where the merchandising started getting out of hand because it was like
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:45.640]  have you guys heard this there's the i don't know you know you never know how much of this is
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:50.040]  apocryphal and how much is true but that the toys had already been put into production before they
[02:06:50.040 --> 02:06:56.920]  made the costumes and the costumes were like just incredibly hot and just and it really limited the
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:03.320]  actors ability to move that's why they just sort of waddle instead of walk uh i hadn't heard that
[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:09.400]  i i had heard that eventually it was going to be uh the wookie planet kashyyyk yeah yeah well which
[02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:12.920]  would have been a lot cooler yeah but your work is taken on stormtroopers you can believe that
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:19.320]  right and there's just a silliness to it that these little furry you know two-foot tall creatures
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:24.360]  are beating stormtroopers literally with rocks i do like that i do like there is a good insurgent
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:28.680]  angle like native people insurgent type thing but the ewoks are one of those characters that are
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:36.120]  mostly made for kids and yeah i don't have much value for adults i i do like the notion that the
[02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:42.680]  ewoks represent um nature where i'll the imperial troops represent like some kind of technological
[02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:46.040]  terror angle there's that obvious angle and there's also the angle of like an insurgent
[02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:50.520]  force against yes a much more dominant military force of the fact that insurgents could yeah like
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:55.960]  you know like native americans versus uh you know you know like during the indian wars the same
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:59.960]  type of territory that was trod much more seriously in ballast argalactica yes i think but
[02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:05.080]  there was an allegory for the iraq war yes yeah and i feel like the other thing that was evident
[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:13.720]  with the whole segment is that they had these characters han and leia who we wanted to see more
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:19.400]  of and would they just they so we got these scenes with them you know having this actual assault on
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:26.040]  the the the shield generator whereas the real what really mattered what was left to really matter in
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:31.320]  the story was the other two angles which was the big space battle with the fleet the two fleets
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:37.080]  fighting each other and uh you know and then primarily the luke vader emperor yeah i mean so
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:43.080]  the whole endor thing in addition to being silly just because they're little ewoks it it really
[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:47.000]  it really felt a little forced because it's like well we just want more han and leia and we're
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.320]  never gonna i mean but that was the gorilla action supporting the larger thing it's like you got to
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:54.760]  deactivate the shield generator which is in a remote place you're gonna send a small strike
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.200]  team because this is your stealth mission that's why luke doesn't go on it he's endangering the
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:01.480]  mission he shouldn't have come because they could sense him and all stuff you could have a speeder
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.640]  chase through the the redwoods that's also that was a nice action scene there uh it's spilling
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:11.240]  yeah well it fits a lot better than like the pod racing scene which is just this whole giant
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:18.200]  digression whereas the the the speeder bikes and the moon was just a really cool action and the
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  speeder bike is like uh you know the whole idea is that stealth and so it's jammed their comlink
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:26.600]  with the little script he used to say we want to have a chase scene and the stakes of the chase
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.480]  scene are as if you let these guys escape they're going to tell the whole empire that you're down
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:32.200]  here never mind the emperor already knows you're down here at that point the audience doesn't know
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.800]  that but there's a reason for the chase scene there's a reason for the desperation it's
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:39.480]  basically hide and seek we don't want the empire to know we're down here some people start getting
[02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.600]  that's the whole thing you think you got them all then you see two other guys get off on speeder
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:46.520]  bikes then you got to jump on a speeder bike and make sure they don't get out of here so one thing
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:51.480]  that used to bother me as a kid and only recently have i come around to the thought that maybe lucas
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:55.960]  actually this is like his last hurrah and he knew what he was doing and it's actually pretty good
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:03.320]  character development and screenwriting is it always bothered me as a kid that in empire vader
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:08.120]  doesn't really want to and not even really just doesn't want to kill luke he wants to turn luke
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:13.800]  and doesn't want to turn him for the emperor i i think he truly and sincerely means it when he says
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.440]  join me and we'll oh no totally he meant he meant that in empire too because that's the whole no no
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  no it's only an empire he doesn't even make the offer in return of the jedi he just takes custody
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:29.480]  of luke and at that moment where he takes custody of luke and he and he takes his lightsaber he says
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:33.960]  he was carrying this sir and he gives him his lightsaber and it's the little i've said this
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.840]  before on other podcasts it's one of my favorite little moments in all of the whole series is what
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:43.240]  does vader do when he gets luke's lightsaber well of course he turns it on and he tries it out a
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:47.800]  little bit just waves it around feels the weight it's like that's what like when i used to ride a
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.400]  skateboard when i was a teenager you get somebody else's skateboard what do you do you take you know
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.680]  you may not take it all the way around the block you just try it out a little bit see what it's
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:59.480]  like you know well so the whole father-son angle like you come in in the beginning like an empire
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.120]  it's like oh my you're identifying with luke like oh darth vader is my father what a dramatic
[02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:08.760]  revelation i'm upset about it and so on and so forth by the time jedi comes around you're looking
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.160]  at it from the other direction vader is going luke is now obviously he's known as luke is always a
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.640]  son but now he's like i've seen my son this is my son if your son made a lightsaber you'd be kind of
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.320]  proud of like hey my son made a pretty good lightsaber here you know like your training is now
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:27.320]  complete if you are internally a a you know a thinking feeling person and you meet up with your
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:31.240]  son like those feelings are going to be there like the fatherly feelings are going to be there
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:35.320]  and that is the feeling that vader has in jedi you know there is no conflict but there is and
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.560]  the conflict is that you know my son is actually pretty cool and i i wanted him to join me in the
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:43.880]  last one but that was me rationalizing my i can still be evil and still have my son here when it's
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:48.280]  clear that my son is i'll never join you right clearly he's not going to join me i'm not too
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:51.480]  gung-ho and kill him because i actually kind of like my son he's actually pretty cool he does
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.000]  some great things and i feel ashamed of the things that i've done in front of my son it's too late for
[02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.200]  me son blah blah that conflict is present and because darth vader wears a mask for all of jedi
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:05.000]  you get to be like is luke like wishing that was there and it's not really and darth vader you know
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.640]  and like many times like you know father we can he tries it right there on the end the scene on
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:14.040]  endor he's like come with me father we can go and like you get nothing from vader's face mask because
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:18.200]  it doesn't change expression and you know is is luke totally wrong about vader or is he right and
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:22.360]  they is is that what is that when he is that when he turns vader in or at least starts to turn him
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:27.560]  like he walks off the ad ad and just calls him father immediately yeah no luke is playing up
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:33.800]  the angles that's a superpower move right like hi dad yeah and yeah and well the whole don't
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:38.280]  resisting it yeah the hole that i always thought i saw as a kid was that why doesn't vader try
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:42.440]  make the same offer again and just be like look i'll give you your lightsaber back let's go kill
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:48.120]  this guy you and i have our differences we can sort them out after i think he's established by
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:51.720]  the whole you know i i was threatening to kill you i cut off your hand i was trying to kill you
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:55.320]  and they still turned me down like that's not going to happen nope and then watching it again
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:59.800]  in recent years i think that that's actually the way it plays it plays out and it also fits with
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:07.480]  the way that luke is clearly a more mature character and and more composed at the beginning
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.480]  even just at the beginning of return of the jedi than he was that that's that scene on bespin in
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:18.600]  cloud city that was vader's chance to turn him well just the fact that he surrenders willingly
[02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:26.360]  hands over his lightsaber to the uh to the stormtrooper patrol uh shows a resolve in luke
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:31.240]  that i think vader recognizes he won't be able to break and also luke was optimistic he thought he
[02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:34.920]  thought he could turn vader he was right in the end but he thought he could turn there is good in
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.120]  him i have felt it when did he feel it he felt it after the end of empire when vader basically vader
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.920]  could have killed him many times and then when luke was going off he's like they're communicating
[02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:49.560]  telepathically as father and son right yeah that's the point where you feel there's some good in him
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.160]  because he is not communicating telepathically boy i'm gonna get you luke when i see you next
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:57.080]  time i'm gonna kill you it's like father son across this distance not only that one of my
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:02.040]  one of my favorite parts of empire is when the falcon finally jumps into hyperspace
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:09.560]  vader doesn't kill anybody he's exactly around he's like he's too there's two things a you did
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:13.320]  everything i told you to you did you disabled the hyperdrive everything it didn't go it didn't work
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:18.840]  it didn't work out but my son got away i'm kind of depressed and i can't even be bothered to murder
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:24.360]  anybody at this point yeah yep it's an emotional moment for vader and again we don't see emotion
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.640]  on his face because it's just a mask and it never changes and it's not even that much body language
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.640]  but what you've got is no he just turns around and kind of walks off kind of dejected the hot
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:35.240]  head that was constantly killing people you know the frustrated hothead it was constantly killing
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:39.160]  people because he wasn't getting what he wanted he realizes that nothing could get him what he
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:45.640]  wanted here because what he wants is his son to love him for some reason the helmet is oddly
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:51.720]  expressive yeah certainly i wonder if that's like lighting it's a blank canvas right right and and
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:57.160]  it's you know i think it's all tied with musical cues but in like in the whole first movie it just
[02:14:57.160 --> 02:15:01.320]  looks like the most evil badass mask you can imagine and there are some differences i know
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.960]  that in the next two it was a lot more polished like in the first one he changes he changes armor
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:11.400]  in each movie and they had a problem in in uh in the original one of getting the eyes to be
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:15.160]  completely black and opaque like sometimes they're they're a little bit lighter gray and it was a
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:21.080]  little bit danger empire i think is the best vader because it is it is sleek and menacing but like
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.240]  you said also there is more body language now it's more expressive with like him reaching out with
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:30.760]  his hand doing all this stuff like he he's able to act more with his body uh in empire also in
[02:15:30.760 --> 02:15:35.960]  in empire his cape seems to not cover his shoulders a lot like you see those big massive shoulder
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:40.440]  pads a lot more yeah and it waves behind him and there's wind like you've got like the body
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:45.160]  language of vader when you know the surprise dinner with uh oh that's alanda leaving them all
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:50.760]  open the doors that vader standing at the head of the table how cool is it han solo yeah everybody
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:56.040]  come on let's just get han solo tattoos he knows he knows tuko's law yeah proudest moment it's so
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:00.920]  good proudest moment he stands in front of layer and just starts shooting that's that's what you do
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:07.800]  that's it's that's the answer so perfect it doesn't work yeah the best the best james bond
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.720]  and ones the best james bonds being a trans bond like the best james bond sequences are the
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:17.880]  sequences in which uh bond does bond reacts in the appropriate way before the audience has time
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:21.400]  to think about what the appropriate way exactly because he's the one who's been in the situation
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:24.920]  many times he's boring the only reason he's still alive is because he immediately knows what to do
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:29.960]  yeah and there's not a lot of reaction shot what should i do blah blah bond is a man of action he
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:33.720]  immediately he knows when it's action is called for immediately goes into action and it catches
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:38.280]  the audience by surprise that's the kind of bond i like so that everybody wants everybody wants to
[02:16:38.280 --> 02:16:43.800]  think they're good in a pinch yeah but han solo is good at the paint but that's the only time
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.560]  i think we've ever seen that i don't know if it's the force or because he's a robot but
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:53.480]  he just catches a bunch of laser bolts which is super super badass but it's kind of this
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:58.440]  steady ramping up of what is possible with the force and you know we knew that you could at this
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.680]  point i think we might have known you could block blaster bolts for the lightsaber but he does it
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:06.680]  with his hands and it shows that he's we don't we don't see that we don't see that to legit i
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:11.400]  actually yeah especially like yoda moves lots of stuff with his mind so that shows that it is
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:16.840]  powerful but he's not teaching luke like you know karate moves or like how to chop things there's
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.320]  not a lot of scenes on de goba where he's showing him fancy lightsaber moves this is how you chop
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:27.080]  stuff he never does you're never so you don't you know so so the dark side force like what would you
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:30.520]  what would you do with the force if you were not in the yoda school of how of what the force is
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.360]  all about uh and that could involve you know blocking things with your hands and in a third
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.520]  movie shooting lightning bolts out of your hands like you know we don't know where how far this
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:43.720]  this leveling tree goes but i i would almost say that it comes right out of like a horror movie
[02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:47.880]  where you don't you know like the monster can you just oh shit you can't even shoot this guy
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.480]  you empty you're going into the vampire or the mummy or something and just nothing happens it's
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:57.400]  like and what you want to show there is han being a man of action and not going vader i knew i would
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:01.960]  find you because that's stupid two goes blah blah blah right and also showing that han may have
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:09.320]  that inclination but he is not of the magic using glass in that like his everything he can do it is
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:13.400]  it's like a child's toy now he'll block a few things and take han's gun and say please sit
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:17.880]  down because you you han all right is that something people want like why can't han solo go
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:21.800]  and fight darth vader why does it have to be luke well the reason is because he's he's he's so
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.240]  yeah it's never been clear to me though i'm not quite sure though if that that move of blocking
[02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.760]  the blaster with your hand because we never see that even in the clone wars where the
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:35.400]  nobody else shot that i it might be because he's got robotic that's what i was thinking i'm not
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:39.400]  sure i'm just going to go with whatever you would think the force has to be involved yeah i'm going
[02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:44.040]  to go with it yeah because it's the most powerful thing a little bit vader do and fine i'm going to
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:48.040]  go a little bit column a little bit column b it's both like maybe vader is like the only guy who
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:53.160]  could yeah maybe you would really screw up your hand if you had a real hand but whatever you know
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.480]  like either way you've got a robot hand afterwards
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:07.400]  it just is a as a small small observation this is such a small detail but it seems as though
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:15.560]  the uh the advances in uh what would you call it uh uh what do you call it like like when a
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:21.880]  somebody uh gets a an artificial limb oh prosthetics prosthetics prosthetic
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:28.360]  technology advanced pretty significantly in the 22 years it's the only technology that it could
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:33.000]  have also been a fashion choice like one is trying to make it look at most like a human hand and the
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000]  other one is can you make me into a machine of war yeah that's two different goals so wait we're
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:41.560]  talking about the end of episode two right when he's got yeah yeah i'm not even talking about
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:46.680]  vader i'm talking about thing going young anakin you know that could also be a star choice too
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:51.240]  because it wasn't it was like steampunk it was like well kind of brass and it was kind of like
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:56.520]  art deco steampunk kind of thing which a lot of the aesthetic of uh like luke went to a nice
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:03.480]  cosmetic surgeon yeah yeah he got a real hand like his his poor old pappy got like steam like
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:08.680]  a steam engine attached to his wrist how are we doing on time i know that it's getting late
[02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:21.240]  can we have 15 more minutes
[02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:31.240]  so
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:38.200]  yeah for sure do you gotta do another uh sponsor uh maybe i do but at the very least i want to show
[02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:43.720]  at the very least i want uh i want john to get a good night's sleep before going to work oh yeah
[02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:49.000]  no work tomorrow you don't work tomorrow now i get off well then okay we got another couple of
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:56.200]  hours yeah all right well let me take uh one more break and thank our third sponsor it's our good
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:21:04.360]  friends at casper you guys remember casper casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses and
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:08.360]  they sell them for a fraction of the price now first time i heard about this i thought holy shit
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:13.160]  this is crazy who the hell would buy a mattress online well guess what makes a lot of sense it's
[02:21:13.160 --> 02:21:17.320]  almost like you know eventually we're gonna buy everything online and we're never gonna have to
[02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:24.520]  leave the house um the mattress industry is so crooked it's ridiculous you go from one mattress
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:28.840]  store to another you can't compare prices because the ceilings they sell in one store all have
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:33.000]  different model names from another store and they're all marked up and there's almost like
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:41.240]  a cartel of a few high-priced manufacturers who collaborate together to keep prices high
[02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.520]  it's it's just a racket and it's a real pain in the ass if you've ever done it so what do you do
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:51.160]  you go to casper and it's so much easier they don't make you choose between stuff you don't
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:56.760]  understand they have one kind of mattress it's a hybrid that combines uh latex foam and memory foam
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:04.120]  uh new mattresses and retail stores typically cost over 1500 bucks casper mattresses cost
[02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:13.160]  between 500 for a twin size mattress uh 750 for full size 850 for queen and just 950 bucks for
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:17.640]  a king-sized mattress now how do you get a mattress shipped to your house this is the
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:23.000]  part that baffled me i had no idea they vacuum packed these things using i don't even know how
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:28.120]  they do it but it comes it doesn't come in a tiny box it's not like you're getting like a little
[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:33.720]  pill and you put water on it turns into a mattress it comes in a box like the size of a like a dorm
[02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.600]  room refrigerator maybe a little bigger than that easily fits through a door you can see how they
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:46.120]  ship them uh then you open the thing up and it just expands into a i one thing i would say
[02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:48.840]  follow their directions open it in the room where you want to use it
[02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:56.440]  it's really really amazing and uh they sent me one a couple months ago when i first sponsored
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:02.760]  the show it's a fine mattress it is really good uh i don't expect that i'll ever buy a mattress
[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:13.000]  in a store again um where do you go to find out more go to casper sleep c-a-s-p-e-r-s-l-e-e-p
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:21.480]  caspersleep.com slash talk show just talk show they don't have the the um it's got a nice sink
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.800]  it's got nice bounce it's not the memory foam thing where like when you wake up in the morning
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:30.280]  there's like an outline of your body on the mattress i can't stand that uh i wouldn't like
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:36.600]  that uh it's not like that at all it's just a nice mattress just feels good uh and here's the thing
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:43.000]  they're made right here in america made in america uh and the other thing too you think i just can't
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:48.360]  see spending you know 800 a thousand bucks on a mattress online they have a risk-free return
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:54.840]  policy try sleeping on any casper for a hundred days get three months with the thing and if you
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:24:02.600]  don't like it free for free they'll take it back take it out of your house so you can't lose go
[02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:08.760]  there buy a mattress open it up in the room where you want to use it three months and then if you
[02:24:08.760 --> 02:24:13.480]  don't like it you can send it back uh if you need a new mattress you're nuts if you don't check out
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:20.520]  casper so go to caspersleep.com and uh slash the talk show oh slash the talk show know that
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:26.840]  even i got that wrong so that brings me to a point here's a point i wanted to make it's a funny time
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:33.160]  but i wanted to make this before we wrap up the show one thing that star wars does and i think
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:39.480]  it's a good thing but it doesn't really make any logical sense is there just always been very
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:46.280]  hand-wavy yada yada yada dot dot dot about how long it takes to get from one planet to another
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:52.520]  in hyperspace it's it's seemingly a big deal to get from tatooine to aldoran because they have to
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:59.400]  pay uh 10 000 credits 10 000 credits 17 000 and it's enough that luke says we could almost buy
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:06.840]  our own ship it's you know uh but how long is it nobody changes their clothes well you know they
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.480]  do the movie is not about long space flights so that's not an important part of the movie needs
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:14.360]  to be in there and all you got to do is make it seem like a really long car trip because that's
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.200]  what people can relate to it's going to be like a really long car trip guys and then that's how
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:22.040]  much time you have in terms of time passing in the movie that's how like well if you're
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:25.560]  if you're in some town in the middle of nowhere and you want to get to the big city you got to
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:29.560]  somehow get there either by doing a long car trip or taking a bus or a train or something like that
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:32.840]  i guess it's not a lot of public transportation the galaxy but if you're gonna have any galaxy
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.160]  spanning civilization you just got to hand wave the travel time and there there is some notion of
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:42.600]  that uh uh tarkin does not want to blow up dantooine because it's too remote to make an
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:47.000]  effective demonstration yeah i don't know what the media situation is yeah like it's far far
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000]  away but the media situation because again you know if we're going to say tatooine is remote
[02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.760]  like they don't have any kind of galactic media that is sort of giving any sort of shared like
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:00.360]  they're not all watching space seinfeld together they're not all on the same page in terms of
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:04.520]  culture they're not listening to the same songs they're not interested in news about what's going
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:09.400]  on the other systems if you're a remote enough system you could be like rebellion empire doesn't
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:13.240]  really affect me we're kind of in a lawless planet run by the huts anyway so no big deal
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:18.680]  it's more like the entire galaxy is about the size of the united states and it's in the united states
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:25.400]  like in the in the pre-interstate highway age yeah tatooine is like arizona nevada maybe you
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:28.280]  got the wild west it's a little bit of the wild west and you got what's going on with the big
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.840]  city and there is organized crime and maybe this prohibition and you know like yeah that type of
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:40.040]  communication delay and here's the guys in your american-centric line of thinking but yeah i i
[02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:45.320]  tend to agree i don't know what about this timeline so this timeline to me is all it's
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:50.440]  just is very i accept it i don't mind it but it if you think about it too much it's pretty hard
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:58.200]  to explain is the falcon leaves hoth and this is totally the hyper drive you right hyper drive
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:03.160]  doesn't work so they go hide in an asteroid field because at the very least we can go there and
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:09.880]  these star destroyers will start stop shooting at us so far so good uh i'll it just just forget that
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:15.080]  this space worm somehow gets huge on an asteroid with no atmosphere and yeah whatever whatever
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:21.400]  the biology of that thing is it's spaceships yeah it needs hydrogen maybe it's meters who knows
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:25.320]  yeah so what so what it's a good was a cool scene and a great surprise so i forgive it
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:30.840]  um but they don't have a hyper drive and they never fix the hyper drive and then han is flipping
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:37.000]  through his computer and he goes lando huh and so somehow he can get to bespin which is
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.880]  well it's where it's already in that system they're in the noad system already where are we
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:46.680]  he's already left there's not much that's it he's left the host system they're in the noise
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.560]  that's what i say it's gonna be like a long car ride well hyperdrive will get you there faster
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:53.240]  but if you're willing to just you know go along the highway at 55 you'll eventually get there
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.520]  it's just preposterous scientifically speaking yeah that's the way it works but then but then
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:28:01.800]  he's going to go to bespin or the lando system quote unquote so sorry continued but that but
[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:06.120]  that's a different solar system right it's not they're not trying to say that bespin is on a
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.360]  different planet in the hoth solar system i don't i actually don't know someone someone who knows
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:13.880]  more about star wars could probably map this out for us but i don't think so because the system
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:20.280]  could also mean the planet being the central and the moons being the system right i think that the
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:26.040]  loosey-goosey uh you know star wars scientific explanation is that hyperdrive is really really
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:30.840]  fast and gets you you know like you said like a couple of hours you can get from one a to b
[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:37.560]  and if you don't take hyperdrive there's still some kind of faster than light way that you're
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.800]  going to get there not not like a hundred years from now you're going to get there in a couple
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:47.480]  of weeks because that's the whole period where luke is training on dagobah yeah exactly right
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:53.640]  the time it takes the falcon to get from the asteroids to bespin is the time the entirety
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:58.040]  of the time that luke trains either luke spends a grand total of about eight hours training
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.320]  or those guys are sitting around playing an awful lot of that video that table video
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:07.400]  is in coprol episodes because we covered these same topics topics in fact this was the uh the
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:11.560]  title of one of the episodes of an empire was jedi weekend because we were discussing how long
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.320]  does he spend how long does he spend on dagobah is he there for a month is there for a week or
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:20.440]  is just like a jedi weekend what's this show you speak of uh you should put it in your show notes
[02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:27.560]  i will and by the way i just googled that there's that there's a question on the swtor.com how did
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.800]  hong get the best investment with no light speed it's a question right in the forums and the first
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:36.280]  answer is that it's pothole yeah no do you know what wait it's what oh applaud you know what i'll
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:42.600]  tell you what um this is classic comic book writing like the hero's only ever as powerful
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:47.720]  as you need him to be for any given scene like superman can move the moon in one scene and then
[02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:56.520]  just get beaten down by batman in the next scene it's it's fine like i i think you know
[02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:03.400]  scott mcnulty forgive me but star trek kind of overly fetishizes this kind of thing and it's
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:07.320]  just a detail it doesn't matter it's it's it has nothing to do with the narrative expression of the
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:13.800]  story right like star trek has gone on like to explain that the warp factor uh the warp factor
[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:17.880]  going from zero to ten is like a logarithm yeah and they've changed their you know they've changed
[02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:22.920]  it a couple of times in order to make it make more sense given yeah so apparently hoth and bespin are
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:30.600]  both in the noad system you i sent you oh my god oh my god look at this just you know that this was
[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:37.560]  backwards this is somebody who this really bothered this yes really bothered them and they were like
[02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:41.960]  and bless them it's like watching awesome i like it because the expanding universe everything has
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:45.480]  to explain all this like you know people who are more into it know all these answers already
[02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:48.920]  because they have to make you know the movie gets to do throwaway lines when you write novel after
[02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:52.520]  novel in this universe you have to eventually figure out where everything is oh no wait no wait
[02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:56.840]  that's a second it's not the same solar system it's the same sector seems right so yeah i mean
[02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:00.680]  it doesn't matter it's all just it's all just hand but you still need faster than life travel
[02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:06.680]  life faster than life i i i and i feel like the movie doesn't suffer for it at all and if they
[02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:12.040]  had and it would have been a whole midichlorian moment if they had gone the whole star trek factor
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:18.120]  and explained that we can no longer go in hyperdrive past speed one but but it doesn't
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:21.880]  matter that's just star trek doesn't do that either started basically just says if if it's
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:26.360]  a dramatic part of a plot we would just simply have someone explain in the moment that whatever
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:31.160]  speed we're going now is either adequate or inadequate for some made-up reason to escape
[02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:34.680]  or not escape from it's like when they're trying to do with the uh trying to get out of the black
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:38.680]  hole in the the jj abrams reboot like the yeah the big hole going and the red matter and they're
[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:41.400]  trying to get away from it like well we're at maximum warp we're not going to make it out and
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:45.960]  blow a thing up like they just need a dramatic moment like there's no there's no uh before that
[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:50.520]  they didn't have long discussions about what it would be like trying to escape from an antimatter
[02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:54.520]  bomb with warp engines whether it could it doesn't matter it just you just need a dramatic moment in
[02:31:54.520 --> 02:31:58.360]  the moment someone yells something that said that tells you the rules you can't do that too much
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:02.680]  because then you get dr who yeah exactly but in terms of vampire what we needed is we needed
[02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:11.160]  luke to be trained by yoda and we needed uh time for uh han and leia to um sort of come together
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:17.720]  in some kind of way uh and sort of the downtime in both the asteroid field and on degaba
[02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:24.440]  provides that story tempo right and then after you after you're done with that it's you know
[02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:30.920]  wave your hands and it's on to the next thing right and it also makes sense then that the
[02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:34.840]  empire could have gotten there before they did because they have ships with fully functioning
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:39.800]  hyper drives and could get there and you know work out their dastardly plan yeah i mean clearly i
[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:45.640]  mean well yeah what does lando say they got there just before you did so oh does he say that just
[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:51.480]  before well i mean obviously enough before that you know vegas has time to plan a dinner party
[02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:57.880]  so i always thought that was pretty classy he's totally classy sort of way right that was that
[02:32:57.880 --> 02:33:02.120]  was the bond villain yes yeah and yeah he was pretty classic the whole time and and
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:09.160]  i i you know i think it makes sense to test the uh the carbonite fusing on han why would you not
[02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:14.520]  why would you not do that like and again it's like we don't want the emperor's prize damage but even
[02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:18.520]  at that point you'd be saying maybe he doesn't want to of course he doesn't want it he wants to
[02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:22.040]  he wants to meet his son i mean even at that point if he's got delusions that it's going to be like
[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:27.880]  father and son the evil duo yeah yeah yeah either way he doesn't want to test it who would want
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:32.360]  you know test it or not that's fine do you think it's made further uncomfortable i mean i presume
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:36.920]  that they did get a meal i do i they got to that's they did that in robot chicken i think
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:40.520]  uh the robot chicken parody where they they play out the rest of that scene where they're awkwardly
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:45.640]  eating and like i didn't see oh i have to put this in the show i think it's robot chicken it's
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:51.880]  gotta be yeah what so what's vader doing he's just sitting there so uh well vader vader and
[02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:57.880]  boba both wear masks that they don't take off right oh yeah i forget boba steps in from the
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:02.760]  side i just want to see other people enjoying their food being in that scene is basically just
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:08.920]  to fuck you to han solo at that point yeah because he has no reason to be there other than like i
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:13.960]  got you it's just to rub it in well i guess he wants the bounty he's like you know yeah that
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:22.360]  guy's he's worth a lot to me yeah like do you think vader ate ate his meals alone in his little
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:27.880]  meditation chamber yeah it's the only way i can take the uh helmet off just in front of a big
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:32.760]  screen put on some sports you know just oh my god you remember in the prequels when they had like
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.960]  robots playing uh football some kind of american style football oh yeah yeah it's so horrible
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:42.360]  well in star wars rebels they bring back that little whatever it's called the circular table
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:46.680]  in the falcon with a little uh yeah clay animation monsters yeah what is that game called i don't
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:51.720]  know i'm sure this name i'm cool with that whatever that you know but really playing
[02:34:51.720 --> 02:34:58.200]  american for joys playing american football is just come on what or even something vaguely
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:02.520]  yeah sure whatever i mean the guy had basically yeah they look like a line of blockers and make
[02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:07.640]  somebody with the football so all right once you've got a 50s diner all bets are yeah i know
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:16.840]  okay so let's blow through the prequel trilogy and can we just blow it up instead yeah but to
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:21.160]  me among the worst things all right the dialogue is terrible throughout the character motivations
[02:35:21.160 --> 02:35:26.760]  are terrible yeah the definition of who's the main characters in this movie are terrible yeah
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:31.400]  through it so you get you get that from the the plinket things right i am yeah that's the red
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:38.040]  letter media it's i watch them again i would hardly recommend them except for all of the weird
[02:35:38.040 --> 02:35:43.240]  uh side plot stuff i don't like the plinket things i don't like the characterization of the
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.920]  framing device i think it's pointless i think the framing device annoying and i think and the
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:50.680]  the thing about the no the no main character which a lot of people pull away from that
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:55.560]  uh in ensemble movies it's perfectly fine that who's the main character in the usual suspects
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:36:01.160]  right who's who's the main character in firefly like it is impossible to have you know or you
[02:36:01.160 --> 02:36:05.320]  can have arguments oh mal's the main character in firefly well is kevin spacey the main character
[02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.600]  in usual suspects or is it uh gabriel burn like you know like ensemble casts are fine who's the
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:14.040]  main character in oceans 11 is it george cluney because he's the most famous and got paid the most
[02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.520]  like ensemble casts are fine but that what he was trying to get at with the who's the main character
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:23.160]  in the phantom menace is that we don't care about any of these people right right i totally main
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:27.880]  characters like who do i care about who who do i identify with who should have been kenobi who
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:31.640]  am i rooting for and in phantom menace the answer is nobody because they're all just cardboard cut
[02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:37.960]  out the entire prequel should have been kenobi and and kenobi's ultimate failure uh to uh
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:43.320]  effectively save anakin from going to the dark side you're like who the hell's qui-gon never
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:47.080]  heard him before yeah and he's pointless there were and in fact there will be said he was trained
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:53.960]  by yoda so what why are we you know and i like me you can hand away that way like well every
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.440]  everybody is trained by yoda it's like saying i was taught by famous professor at famous school
[02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:02.120]  you really weren't really maybe you had one class with him but yeah that's it so everyone's always
[02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:06.120]  trained by yoda because he's sort of the head of the training hierarchy but anyway like yeah
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:10.760]  introducing all like every level of the prequels has problems you can get a little picky you and
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.880]  things you can complain about them in the micro level and you can pull all the way back to level
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:17.240]  i always like to go out and says they just failed in their fundamental tasks explain why and it can
[02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:24.120]  turn to the dark side i i think the reason qui-gon exists is because of well one of the reasons is
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:29.480]  that i feel like lucas got a bug up his butt to have a parallel to the first one where you know
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:34.520]  there's this great moment where obi-wan sacrifices himself and dies and you know oh my god this jedi
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:38.200]  who is so wise and sage and powerful throughout this movie all of a sudden he's dead i didn't
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:43.000]  expect that well i want that again but it can't be obi-wan because i need obi-wan you know for
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.320]  the next six movies and so we'll invent this new guy and then what happens to obi-wan well he gets
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:52.440]  to sit on a spaceship for 45 minutes so the one thing i will say about that obi-wan thing is that
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.040]  uh qui-gon's death kind of gives him uh
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:04.760]  the the option at least to do what luke did in return of the jedi where he just goes bananas
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:10.200]  and and really wails on uh darth maul another character we don't care about but that doesn't
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:15.640]  really even happen as as the plinkett thing points out well but but he does but then you don't get
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.880]  there's no payoff there's no there's no idea that obi-wan is constantly teetering on the edge of the
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:26.920]  yeah what you get is more like qui-gon is kind of like the the the problem student who's always a
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:33.560]  little bit uh disrespectful and uh and kind of you know i don't know like like a little bit of
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.480]  a rebel but never do you get the idea that qui-gon is teetering on the edge of the dark side where
[02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:42.200]  the obi-wan is just that they're kind of like they're kind of like the the the you know the
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:45.800]  the trouble students but it's never you know whereas luke's whole thing is like yeah you're
[02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:48.920]  teetering the edge of the dark side so when obi-wan goes nuts and starts wailing on him
[02:38:48.920 --> 02:38:54.680]  we're not sad music is not playing we are rooting for obi-wan to win he does win there is no you
[02:38:54.680 --> 02:39:01.880]  know pacifism so i i've got two things about that first of all i loved i mean so visually that
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:11.160]  battle was stunning as as contrived as it was it looked pretty cool um i liked that uh as those
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:17.480]  arbitrary doors closed like laser doors closed uh qui-gon sat down and meditated while dearth
[02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:25.800]  maul stalked back and forth that was nice i liked it uh i liked that after um qui-gon had been killed
[02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:32.440]  obi-wan was like jumping up and down just rid of the girl like he's clearly pissed right uh but
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:37.560]  the you're right there was no payoff and worse than there being no payoff and this is horrible
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:44.040]  um he ends up in uh like a tactically inferior position he's basically fallen halfway down the
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:50.680]  hall and he's got no lightsaber and he manages to beat dearth maul by jumping over him force
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:54.760]  grabbing a lightsaber and cutting him in half yeah it's the henchman thing when henchman's in
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:58.360]  movie henchmen in the movies like just get into position in front of the hero and then stay in
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:03.720]  motionless while the hero does some cool move exactly now here's the thing that is an incredibly
[02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:14.440]  inferior position and at the end of um the revenge of the sith we see we we have konobi in in a
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:21.080]  marginally elevated position over right over uh anakin and they have to and they do the same the
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:26.600]  same the lines out because like i need you to understand that now i have the advantage because
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:30.600]  i want you to know that the next decision anakin makes whether the fight or not doesn't make like
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:36.280]  it's just it doesn't make any sense because we've seen we've seen konobi beat way crazier odds
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:41.160]  against a guy that was you know our group arguably maul was like probably one of the better fighters
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:46.920]  that we've seen right so it's uh it's just it's so it's so frustrating it's all nonsensical
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:52.040]  it is nonsensical at every possible level you go you go really picky you're like medium level like
[02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:56.920]  from moment to moment scene to scene action to action motivation to motivation like the fight
[02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:02.280]  scenes make no sense the the larger stories make no sense it's like at any level of zoom you still
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:09.000]  get the poo emoji is what yeah to to to jump to that vate or not vader well he was vader but the
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:15.080]  anakin obi-wan's fight in in revenge of the sith in in that very fight scene it is i never thought
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:19.560]  about it before how it parallels the darth maul obi-wan somebody you're in a lower position and
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.200]  he didn't even have a lightsaber in his hand yet you're right though that is it's pretty damning
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:28.840]  but even in that one fight scene in the ebb and flow of one guy having the upper hand one guy
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.560]  having the lower hand you know upper hand lower hand you know ebb and flow the fights going back
[02:41:33.560 --> 02:41:39.000]  and forth that was so far and away not the worst position one of them had been in i mean those
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.640]  guys would come back from so much worse position if you want to go farther level in that in that
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:49.000]  scene where the two of them fighting you want the fight to not be about the fight you want it to be
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.600]  about something else but the something else is about is so stupid and you don't care about it
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:56.440]  at all and you've totally checked out an anakin as a character for three whole movies you couldn't
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:42:00.440]  give a damn about what the like the underlying you didn't even check out you never checked in
[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:06.520]  you just yeah right exactly but no it's like if you're gonna have a long fight scene like
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:10.360]  culminate you know a trilogy of movies a long fight scene between two people
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:14.200]  you have to have established whatever the underlying issue is to the degree that the
[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:17.640]  tension of the fight scene is not just about the fighting part but by the time episode three comes
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:22.840]  along you're just like whatever just that's why it just seems like all this drags on so long and
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:27.080]  it's boring who cares who cares who win you know who wins you know what happens you don't there's
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.600]  no emotional stakes because you don't care about any of the people and then the mechanics of the
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:34.440]  fight scene aren't any interesting phantom menace i think had a well-choreographed fight scene
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:40.840]  with some interesting things in it uh that didn't make too much sense did you care about the
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:44.680]  characters maybe you kind of cared about obi-wan because you knew he was going to be qui-gon i mean
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:49.320]  lee mason is fairly charismatic and his character was vaguely interesting darth maul was a total
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:54.280]  cipher and was stupid and then they killed him so so much for that yeah he was almost like a
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.680]  red shirt yeah he really was just a red shirt it was just like a big mean looking scary guy who's
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:02.760]  got like two lines and your only reason you you think he's intimidating is because like you assume
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:08.360]  he's a good fighter and you later see that he is and that he seems scary but i mean vader had a
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:12.040]  whole movie to be intimidating before he took out obi-wan yeah darth maul was like you saw him
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:16.600]  briefly i i feel that that that final fight would have almost been better served if just
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:20.600]  i don't know like obi-wan kicks down the door and just eviscerates
[02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:26.120]  anakin like immediately just chops it into pieces like because that's what you need to have happen
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:30.360]  right like that's well i mean you need to have you need to have the emotional payoff of whatever
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.440]  their supposed conflict is about and whatever is like oh anakin why are you turning but but they
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:38.280]  it was just so squandered at that point yeah yeah it's like whatever but i but i feel like you want
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:44.360]  to have this once you've decided once once konobi has decided i think there needs to be a decisive
[02:43:44.360 --> 02:43:49.960]  thing and what happened was not decisive really you know obi-wan was supposedly holding back it's
[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:53.480]  like i really don't want to kill you i can kill you because you're a stupid kid and you didn't
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:57.720]  take all my lessons and i'm a good fighter i can but i don't want to i'm trying to convince you
[02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:03.160]  and talk you down from it eventually like i have the high ground if the next move you make is not
[02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:08.040]  he just says to the audience like i'm setting up a scenario in which now this fight is over now and
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.280]  i'm telling you that the decision anakin makes now will determine whether the fight ends for him and
[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:17.160]  for me and the the rash move would be for him i'm telling him don't do this rash move because i am in
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:21.080]  a superior position even though that makes no sense the contest entire fight i am simply like
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:26.760]  where it's whatever the script the script has run out so now yeah i'm just going to tell you
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:31.160]  what is going to happen here i can't actually make it happen organically through a story you know
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:35.400]  where things were events unfold and situations arise we can't have that because that'd be too
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:39.400]  complicated i'm just going to tell you this is the ending part of a dick move to let your friend
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:46.120]  slash i thought if you like a brother to burn alive maybe you know put him out of his misery
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:50.840]  yeah no it doesn't make sense like do i try to save him like even batman saves a joker yeah
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:52.440]  yeah i'm gonna take your lightsaber
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:58.680]  and you it's like i don't know if we're supposed to believe that you thought well he's a goner
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.400]  or just let him burn to death and it's like it doesn't make any sense like there's no there's
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:07.480]  no reason it has to play out that way like they just it's like when you're writing the script
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.680]  this is the type of thing you think about like you know where you want to go and you have to
[02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:14.680]  have a series of events that leads naturally to right you need to track can't you can't force
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:20.520]  you need to trap your protagonist into a course of action that leads you down down the path that
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.680]  you've voted and nothing was nothing was forcing obi obi-wan have like an appointment he had to
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.600]  get to all right well i would pull you out of the lava but i it's not it's not even that hard to
[02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:32.920]  think of something very close where you're all right you're and and this is one of those things
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:37.640]  that i don't know if you guys remember but i remember even as a kid that the fan magazines
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:43.000]  had rumors that if they're ever if they ever made a prequel trilogy that the way that vader got the
[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:48.760]  way he was and the whole reference to you know the you know last we met i was but the learner
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:52.680]  now i'm the master you know that these guys knew each other was that you know there were
[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:58.120]  rumors all the way back then like 80 81 that it was some kind of lightsaber duel and obi-wan
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:03.320]  knocked him into lava and that's what screwed him up something something vader you know obi-wan
[02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:07.400]  gave him a ass kicking and he fell on so just make it an edge you know you're on a cliff or
[02:46:07.400 --> 02:46:12.200]  something like a volcano and you he cuts off his arm his lightsaber falls to the ground and
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:16.200]  he falls into a pit of law and he does it's unintentional effectively right like yeah
[02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:20.040]  well not unintentional like if i wanted to do it what i would have i mean you got to have a
[02:46:20.040 --> 02:46:23.080]  whole other different three movies in front of this to lead up to this but what you'd want to
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:27.240]  have happen is to have them have whatever the underlying issue and have it play out through
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:34.920]  through a lightsaber thing and have basically have obi-wan try and fail to save him right from
[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:38.760]  the lava thing like that it's not like he he like hit him into the lava then in second thoughts and
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:43.640]  try to save them that like the fight led to a situation in which anakin was go was going to
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:49.080]  have was going to fall in the lava and the the battle was obi-wan trying to save him not like
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:51.880]  obi-wan pushed him into the lobby in second thoughts because then you have well he needs
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:56.680]  to try to save him both from the going to the dark side and from the ultimate physical demise right
[02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:01.400]  right it depends on what you want that want the conflict to be if you want the conflict to be
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:05.560]  that can feels like he was betrayed by obi-wan then you could have it be like you know obi-wan
[02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:08.440]  trying to show him that he wasn't betrayed if you want the conflict to be something different like
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:11.880]  a love triangle or some other like i don't know it depends on what the conflict is how you want
[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:16.040]  it to play out but you've already written a thing where he has to survive and he's all smart and
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.480]  messed up and obi-wan has his saber those things were already set so you have him cut off his hand
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:26.280]  his sabers there on the ground he falls in the pit and he's gone and you know obi-wan's not nuts
[02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:30.520]  he's not jumping down into a lava pit to make sure the guy's dead he just assumes he's dead
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:36.280]  and somehow he's still so powerful he's got the dark side he can keep himself alive in a lava pit
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:40.200]  even while he's getting all burned up and there you go you're done or i mean i think you probably
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:44.680]  also i would have obi-wan to know that he's still alive and know that he has failed to save him but
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:49.880]  the you know like because yeah that's because obi-wan is hiding on tatooine so he knows like
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:54.200]  who is he hiding luke from if he thinks vader is well i like the idea of vader being like
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:48:01.240]  being a thing and then slowly uh it's you know obi-wan recognizes it like oh my god that that's
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:05.480]  what happened yeah i wouldn't be tied to the lava pit though yeah i know the lava pit is from it's
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:10.520]  from lucas it's from the fan magazines from way back who cares that's pretty ham-fisted because
[02:48:10.520 --> 02:48:15.480]  it's like first of all lord of the rings did it first and second of all and then it's slightly
[02:48:15.480 --> 02:48:19.400]  differently second of all like anything we've already established anything that involves like
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.880]  a pratfall or a slapstick or like whoop i lost my balance and fell into this thing it's like
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:28.760]  it's such a uh uh ignoble oh my god imagine they dropped anakin into like a so like pit
[02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:33.480]  yeah someone bumped into him like he was just walking on one of those various walkways that
[02:48:33.480 --> 02:48:38.360]  has no railings on it and like they tried to pass each other into reactors real ham screen
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:46.120]  yeah yeah um so the whole the whole prequel trilogy i feel like it's mostly in hindsight it's
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:53.720]  a like fan fiction-esque trying to write in as many coincidences as possible uh you know like
[02:48:53.720 --> 02:49:02.360]  you've already mentioned don't say c3po made by a boyhood uh you know anakin even though he's
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:07.160]  clearly as we've seen through all of the movies like he's right off the assembly line he's right
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:12.520]  off the assembly line there's like other protocol droids who look exactly like him anakin was not a
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:15.800]  very imaginative child he just made one looks exactly like the ones maybe he has like a radio
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:22.200]  shack it's like a kid you know it's like a kid yeah but somehow he didn't have the outer shell
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:29.080]  for him uh you know to jango fat uh we all we've killed boba fett and he was a badass so we can't
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:33.160]  still have him around but we'll just put his father in and then we'll say that he's oh also
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:39.720]  that cool fat guy he's the the the parent of all the clones he's the template clone zero
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:45.400]  that's horrible uh it seems like they're getting away from that and then well who knows but
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:53.240]  i i i don't even you could list them forever and ever i'd say flaw number two is turning the jedi
[02:49:53.240 --> 02:50:01.720]  from these like martial artists who are masters of subtlety to superheroes right like it just
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:07.240]  suddenly jumped from you know like these guys who specialize mostly in like going unnoticed i mean
[02:50:07.240 --> 02:50:12.360]  that's what obi-wan does in like to shut down the reactor beam it's it's awesome it's so cool in the
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:16.920]  first movie the way obi-wan this lone old that's how he deals with the sand people too he just
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:21.880]  makes a crazy noise when they run away he doesn't go slice and dice them he just you know right and
[02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:26.680]  there's this totally cool scene you know super cool scene where there's the two stormtroopers
[02:50:26.680 --> 02:50:31.640]  by the the the tractor beam control and you know it's like if you've seen the new tk-421 it's
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:35.640]  pretty i heard it's quite a thing to see your memory of star wars lines is quite a mishman
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:43.240]  yeah tk-421 is han solis yeah all right whatever the model name is what's the model name of the
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.400]  sky jumper that he's talking about syracuse whatever it's like have you seen the nuke the
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:53.080]  new camaro uh it's just a cool scene and it's a nice little it's like george lucas when he
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:57.160]  made films for humans it's like well you know what that's probably what stormtroopers would talk
[02:50:57.160 --> 02:51:02.200]  about you know cool spaceships and stuff like that and then all he does is make like a little
[02:51:02.200 --> 02:51:06.520]  noise like you know they hear something over there they turn their heads and boom he's gone
[02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:12.680]  perfect that's what the jedis did and then whole trilogy it's established that they're like marvel
[02:51:12.680 --> 02:51:21.240]  superheroes well and they can do things like when uh you know growing up that that line of like uh
[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:27.320]  you know i fought in the clone wars with your father uh i never thought of it like they were
[02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:32.040]  generals or anything i just thought that they fought together and they happened to be general
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:39.000]  kenobi oh sorry yeah i did but i i didn't think that they were um commanders of troops no no no
[02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:45.960]  no i didn't think that they were outside of the weird general command structure right i just
[02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:53.640]  thought that they were jedi that happened to be part of the army oh i mean like yeah it's not a
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:59.320]  jedi that's not a problem you can have you know but the the prequels certainly sort of preclude
[02:51:59.320 --> 02:52:03.480]  that possibility but like yeah when i was a kid when i thought of them you fought fighting the
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:08.040]  clone wars what i pictured was them fighting in the way that luke was aspiring to fight and that
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:13.400]  they were pilots of you know x-wings or whatever and they were shooting things with guns and flying
[02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:16.920]  x-wings around in the fact they happened to have the force maybe gave them a little bit better
[02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:20.360]  piloting skills but in general that's how they were operating within the machinery of the war
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:25.000]  as young men is that you fought in the clone wars as a warrior of the type that's who was in that
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:29.080]  that's exactly it yeah and maybe you pull out a blast when you blast some people but when you need
[02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:33.480]  to get the the honor thing going you can pull out your lightsaber now that they were a bunch of
[02:52:33.480 --> 02:52:37.320]  priests and robes running around and there was some i mean that was the problem of the prequels
[02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:41.160]  is that you know so if you're gonna if you're gonna do that timeline and you're gonna make
[02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:47.720]  uh jedi's normal and you're gonna have a lot of them they're they're no longer special and you
[02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:53.000]  have to embrace that to a degree that the prequels didn't feel comfortable embracing like it's as if
[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:58.680]  you had a movie in which uh one person had a gun and it was a big special thing or you know like
[02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:02.520]  steven king the guns the gunslinger series where guns are a rarity or whatever and then you do
[02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:06.280]  prequels to them where everybody has guns if you're gonna do the movie where everybody has
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:09.960]  guns you have to do it like saving private ryan where guns are not part of the story at all it's
[02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:14.120]  just normal and you move on from it very quickly on to whatever the actual story is the story is
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:19.320]  not can you believe all these guys have guns right yeah now we know they all have like it's normal
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:23.960]  you have to have another story there that's the story of that you know a dramatic thing happening
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:28.520]  in war or whatever so you're gonna have a million jedi running around the jedi can't be that special
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:32.440]  and you have to have another story that takes place and people just happen to have lightsabers
[02:53:32.440 --> 02:53:36.920]  in the same way that people happen to have i completely agree and one thing that i always
[02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:43.000]  liked about star wars that i that i feel has been sort of betrayed over the years um is something
[02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:49.480]  that sets it apart from star trek and in star trek each alien species or they call them races
[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:59.480]  each alien race has a prescribed set of um sort of values and a cultural aspect to it like klingons
[02:53:59.480 --> 02:54:05.640]  are warriors the frangi are traitors like the the humans are vaguely fleshed out the romulans are
[02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:12.440]  duplicitous the vulcans are logical and i always thought and i think it stems from the um from the
[02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:18.440]  cantina scene in star wars that these are just a bunch of people hanging out or aliens like it's
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:23.880]  you can have grido can be an asshole but that doesn't mean that everybody that looks like
[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:28.600]  grido is going to be a bounty hunter out to kill people well you've got the huts that are all
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:33.480]  gangsters supposedly but not in the movies family but it's not in the movies they don't say it is
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:38.680]  jabba the hut that's all you hear about well no but i did mention that the huts run the show sure
[02:54:38.680 --> 02:54:43.400]  but i mean that could be i mean maybe the hut is as far as far as i know that's their family
[02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:48.600]  that's his family name i don't know yeah exactly maybe that's just and and but that's what i mean
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:54.280]  about it it's been slowly betrayed over the years of this notion of like this group or you know or
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:55:00.280]  this this alien species acts in this way and there is a nice touch like that if it's star wars
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:05.960]  you know if we're going to be be nice and say nice things about the prequels in the in phantom menace
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:12.120]  one of anakin's childhood friends is a yeah except i think he's grido i think he's actually grido
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:19.400]  well oh you do i think they call him burrito i really do oh it's hard yeah like don't the
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:25.960]  jedi i appreciate your notion yeah the jedi council oh my god no that's grido yeah oh god
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:30.360]  that's horrible i'll go i'll go check i try i tried to forget that it's it's warwick davis anyway
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.920]  it's warwick davis playing yeah i think they call him grido yeah but the the jedi council and
[02:55:34.920 --> 02:55:38.360]  phantom menace though is the kind of the united colors of benetton where they're like anyone can
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.040]  be in jedi so they take every single star wars race they try to throw in one of them including
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:47.160]  whatever yoda is because they've got the yaddle thing so wait right one thing oh man i'm just i'm
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:53.000]  going to use this just to air all of my star wars grievances out yoda should not have a lightsaber
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:58.200]  i never thought i was eight years old when i was like no there's no way yoda should have a life or
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:05.720]  whenever it came out i would not have done that it doesn't yoda yoda i remember being a kid before
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:11.560]  jedi came out oh no it was after jedi trying to figure out if yoda could beat the emperor and it
[02:56:11.560 --> 02:56:19.080]  was always like well yoda's too good for that shit like he he's he doesn't fight he's he's just
[02:56:19.080 --> 02:56:24.520]  he's beyond that kind of level like it doesn't matter to him uh he definitely does not pull out
[02:56:24.520 --> 02:56:29.720]  a lightsaber and try to cut people in pieces i i couldn't agree more and i was so proud of what
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:33.240]  jonas and i were talking about because i've been really on a star wars kick lady and we were just
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:37.000]  talking i was so proud of him and he said that jonas came up with the same thing that he thought
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:41.480]  yoda shouldn't have had a lightsaber because in the first trilogy the emperor didn't have a
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:46.040]  lightsaber and wouldn't that be cool if like the top dark side guy is so powerful he doesn't need
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:52.680]  a lightsaber and the top light side guy that's like that's for kids elegant yeah like an elegant
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:58.520]  what is an elegant weapon for a more civilized age they don't need weapons they're they're right
[02:56:58.520 --> 02:57:03.480]  and then secondarily even if you're going to say okay he does have a lightsaber he shouldn't fight
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:10.360]  like a pinball machine bouncing around a machine once you're gonna have him try to fight with a
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:15.800]  lightsaber that's really his only viable strategy is to be a little chasmadian devil whirling
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:20.040]  dervish because otherwise it's like people have to bend down to even like so should i swing at
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:25.320]  you down there somehow he should be so powerful if he does have a lightsaber that it's like it would
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.840]  be like his his battles would be like that the the first battle between obi-wan and very slow
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:36.600]  very simple and it's like he's just he's he's one step ahead of you he's too small i can just cut
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:40.200]  your ankles off i mean like it's it's a mistake to give him a lightsaber if you do give him one
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:45.240]  you go with the uh the the anime cliche that they also do in samurai movies where it's like two
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.320]  motionless people standing facing each other then there's some flash of action and then one guy
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:53.800]  falls apart because he's been sliced in half yeah like that but i wouldn't do it at all yeah you
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:57.960]  just should be able to the reason that you said like you know the emperor didn't have one yoda
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:04.520]  doesn't need one the and the frenetic pace of his lightsaber battling is just it just reeks to me
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:10.520]  of like they they were so hobbled when he was a practical effect by the limits of puppetry and
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:16.600]  it's like so hard to make him even like walk right and they had like seven puppeteers working yoda
[02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:21.720]  simultaneously so that his eyes could move while his mouth moved and it's a fascinating you know
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:26.920]  backstory of how they made that yoda puppet as realistic as they did and clearly they had trouble
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:32.280]  making him eat soup right in the first one and make him believable and then all of a sudden they
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:37.880]  come to george lucas and they're like well as a computer generated effect he can do a triple
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:41.560]  somersault right over count duke whose head i think it was led the other way i think lucas
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:46.600]  wanted to see him fight with lightsaber because yeah i agree i agree yes and yeah i yeah i blame
[02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:51.720]  george lucas entirely that it was like but like these front you know that he saw no beauty in in
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:57.160]  the economy of the limits of yoda as a practical no it doesn't or even like the whole the whole
[02:58:57.160 --> 02:59:02.440]  philosophy of the force as expressed in empire which is lucas's least favorite movie wait is
[02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:10.680]  it really is that is he on record saying that yes yes oh god are you surprised no i just hadn't
[02:59:10.680 --> 02:59:15.560]  heard that i mean now i'm in uh like i'm i'm i still hold a grudge against stephen king because
[02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:21.640]  he doesn't like the shining that is explicable because it's not that i don't think he doesn't like
[02:59:21.640 --> 02:59:26.840]  the shining it's that the shining is so different from the book he's like this is not a an adaptation
[02:59:26.840 --> 02:59:30.680]  of my book i think my book is good and this movie is a different movie i think he would admit that
[02:59:30.680 --> 02:59:35.640]  the shining is a good movie but he would say it's a vaguely no actually he's said that it's a bad
[02:59:35.640 --> 02:59:40.040]  movie but because he doesn't think it understood he does he's he's a fan of like typical horror
[02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:44.680]  movies like he likes darkness he likes surprises he likes but i think i think he can appreciate
[02:59:44.680 --> 02:59:48.680]  psychological horror too it's just that it's it is it doesn't capture anything about his book
[02:59:48.680 --> 02:59:52.120]  that he feels like there was value in my book and this movie captures none of it which is true
[02:59:52.120 --> 02:59:56.920]  it captures different value that is not in the book yeah you know is it well actually it's we
[02:59:56.920 --> 03:00:01.800]  know the answer have you guys ever seen his shining miniseries for abc which starred the
[03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:08.680]  guy from no because i was angry at him the guy from the guy from wings you can see what he you
[03:00:08.680 --> 03:00:13.640]  can we see we we know what stephen king thinks is a good film adaptation oh i did see i think
[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:16.920]  i think i saw the first one i don't know if you know that was good but at least it's faith more
[03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:22.040]  faithful to the book head i mean i know he it's like i know he likes it i know but it wasn't
[03:00:22.040 --> 03:00:26.200]  cemetery movie and that tells me everything that i need to know about is it's basically like this
[03:00:26.840 --> 03:00:31.560]  kubrick's the shining is based on the book in the same way that blade runner is based on
[03:00:31.560 --> 03:00:36.360]  do android's dream of electric sheet yeah that's basically the connection yeah yeah source material
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:41.320]  and it's good anyway whatever i don't want to diverge into that but uh how do we get there
[03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:47.800]  anyway yeah so no i'm not i jedi is a superpower and i'm not surprised but i am depressed that uh
[03:00:47.800 --> 03:00:54.760]  lucas dislikes empire strikes back or it it's his least favorite one that that boggles my it
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:58.840]  boggles my mind like how it turned out it didn't turn out the way the way like that's the reason
[03:00:58.840 --> 03:01:03.640]  he started to take over a little bit more control in jedi than total control in the prequels is that
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:08.120]  he was distracted by you know building his empire and like the success of star wars or whatever that
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:11.640]  he basically had to outsource and he didn't want to direct another movie because it was so
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:16.840]  exhausting to star wars you should read the book it's yeah jw rinsler they're huge hardcovers one
[03:01:16.840 --> 03:01:21.720]  for a new hope one for empire one for jedi they're beautiful giant hardcover books you can also get
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:27.080]  ebook versions and they are long and there's tons of stuff in them about the making of all these
[03:01:27.080 --> 03:01:35.320]  movies i didn't buy the red jedi one i have the first two gotta buy the jedi one you gotta have
[03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:41.720]  the complete set yeah now at this point i'll probably jedi does do a really cool i mean as
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:47.960]  annoying as the e-works are that um the integration of the stop motion animation of the uh the scout
[03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:55.080]  walkers into the forest scenes is bananas it shows like the the uh the top the highest level the peak
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:59.640]  of a bunch of model spaceships going because after that it was like all going to be cg and so it's
[03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:04.680]  like this is you know the most money the most experience the people who know how to do it best
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:08.520]  doing the kind of battles that they could have only dreamt of in a new hope and then after that
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.960]  it was basically like and no one will ever top that because everything else after that will be
[03:02:11.960 --> 03:02:16.200]  cg that's space fine cg is good but but it's a different kind of space and no one is ever gonna
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:21.720]  that space battle blew my mind like the you see it from the front of the cockpit of the uh the falcon
[03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:26.280]  like just that swarm of firefighters coming at you yeah or even just the thing where they they
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:30.920]  you know flip over to go into the little tunnel into the death star like the motion control camera
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:36.040]  moves to you know point this out as well like that they didn't just do the straightforward easiest
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:40.840]  things they wanted to which is why it's great in the the force awakens trailer yeah the ridiculous
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:46.040]  camera moves and tracing the the falcon around that's part of the star the star wars aesthetic
[03:02:46.040 --> 03:02:49.960]  is that unlike for example star trek where the ships kind of fight like naval things where they
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:53.640]  kind of moving which is cool too but it's not the same thing right but it's a whole different thing
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:59.400]  but in star wars it's like everybody flies fancy like everyone does everything like the hard way
[03:02:59.400 --> 03:03:02.600]  it looks cool because it looks cool basically there's no other reason like why do you have
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:06.120]  to spiral and twist around when you go into the star why does the camera fall because it looks
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:12.280]  exciting dramatic and they're like the way that han parks in the ass yeah he flies over his parking
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:18.200]  spot and then like doesn't he nearly i'm like right down into it yeah because he's got style
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:22.760]  yeah he's got like you you just know that his signature yeah he does not fly casual
[03:03:23.720 --> 03:03:27.640]  yeah and and like the the fact that you you know if you think about how the motion control with
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:31.560]  all these models was done for jedi that you know everything all shot separately or whatever the way
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:35.480]  that space battle was choreographed with the different things that happen in it and so that
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:40.680]  you get coherent action it's just i mean it's easier to do it in cg because you can plan the
[03:03:40.680 --> 03:03:45.160]  whole thing out and you put the camera that you want in the scene with models you you got to
[03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:49.400]  shoot an individual model doing its thing and then know when you put them all together it's going to
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:52.360]  make one coherent scene and if they don't it's not like you can move the camera to a different
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:58.120]  position and try it from here like yes yeah it takes ages you get it you get a sense of spatiality
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:03.240]  that that it just you could physicality like cgi you can tell they've got weight you know i don't
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:08.280]  know how to describe it well and the thing is they had you don't realize it but like go if you go
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:13.240]  back on with the stopwatch and see at how how much time during this space battle scene are models on
[03:04:13.240 --> 03:04:17.640]  the screen and it's incredibly small amount of time because it was so expensive and time consuming to
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:22.200]  do spend a lot of time seeing people's faces and cockpits and stuff like that and the trick is
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.520]  how do i make a coherent battle scene where i can only show the models for a total of like
[03:04:27.560 --> 03:04:32.520]  10 percent of the of the battle time because it's just so damn expensive and so every camera every
[03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:37.320]  shot of models has to be like in this scene there's like three storyboards we have to see
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:42.920]  big ship big ship move this way death star fire ship scatter and the message is getting across
[03:04:42.920 --> 03:04:47.480]  here is the death star is active it's shot a ship ships are scattered is the lame falcon this scene
[03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:52.680]  yes no like and you get like three seconds of screen time to convey an entire movement of a
[03:04:52.680 --> 03:04:56.600]  thing and then a more a bunch of people's faces and talking and stuff and then you get three more
[03:04:56.600 --> 03:05:00.920]  seconds of ships moving and what happened between that one shot of ships moving the other one it's
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:05.800]  communicated by the people talking by the interior shots by alma akbar yelling or whatever but it's
[03:05:05.800 --> 03:05:11.080]  still all weaves together yeah it's a good yeah world war ii style yeah exactly like yeah yeah
[03:05:11.080 --> 03:05:15.160]  don't show the show you make a do with what you have yeah yeah you make do with what you have
[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:20.520]  and you say how do i how do i make this coherent when i know that i can only show the the ships
[03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:23.880]  flying around the screen for fractions of a second you make every one of the seconds count versus
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:27.880]  like you know episode three space battle which things just flying everywhere all the time i
[03:05:27.880 --> 03:05:33.800]  mean whatever so that brings me to my man i'm basically just using you as my star wars therapy
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:40.120]  at this point um the battle at the end of a new hope to take out this has death star is
[03:05:40.120 --> 03:05:45.480]  brilliant you can tell what's happening like the you know the rebel ships are now holding patterns
[03:05:45.480 --> 03:05:49.880]  somewhere above the death star uh and they keep going on trench runs and effectively getting cut
[03:05:49.880 --> 03:05:56.200]  down by tie fighters so basic it's it's great and there's and and there's a map in the rebel base
[03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:01.240]  that shows how close the it's coming to the thing it is it all makes no sense if you think about it
[03:06:01.240 --> 03:06:05.000]  for three seconds it's like we can go all across the galaxy but the last 10 meters we have to do
[03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:09.160]  in dramatic well whatever let's buy it for artistic license and and the same thing with
[03:06:09.160 --> 03:06:16.520]  like the uh in broad strokes a very large space station which they were not gravitational
[03:06:16.520 --> 03:06:22.040]  against small fighters well whether they weren't careful they you know it wasn't designed for a
[03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:25.640]  for an attack like this and this kind of attack is the only attack the rebels have it's a typical
[03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:29.160]  underdog type story we're gonna attack with a small number of people we're gonna go through
[03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:33.320]  this little exhaust port but they never thought like it more or less works in broad strokes but
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:37.160]  the most important thing is like you said once you've established that stuff even if it's
[03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:42.040]  completely nonsensical the idea that there's a trench there's a target we've told you what it is
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:45.720]  we're gonna make a bunch of runs at it and it's gonna look cool because trenches are cool because
[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:49.480]  the walls are close to you so so this is right exactly so this is my argument it's about the
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:55.960]  battles as portrayed in in over the star wars movies that battle makes sense granted you know
[03:06:55.960 --> 03:07:01.480]  your death star has a dumb design then you know did everything that you know stipulates everything
[03:07:01.480 --> 03:07:09.160]  that john just said um the uh the battle of hoth makes perfect sense kind of i don't know
[03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:13.160]  how jumping out of with the hand waving of like why can't we just bring these things down yeah
[03:07:13.160 --> 03:07:17.960]  well there's a shield and like perimeter we have to fly we have to land far away like whatever but
[03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:22.040]  whatever yeah and you like why can't why do the walkers have to walk to the place why can't they
[03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:27.640]  just kind of like suffice suffice to say they have to walk and that's fine and the rebels are
[03:07:27.640 --> 03:07:31.400]  fighting a holding action they they have no illusion that they're going to win but they're fighting
[03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:35.960]  a holding action uh mostly ineffective but they stay in their trench and they start blasting and
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:44.440]  stuff good um the kind of crazy ewok attack kind of crazy a little bit of the insurgency thing
[03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:47.800]  i think it would work if those guys were just wookies i think that would just work
[03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:51.880]  because you could picture a wookie hitting somebody over the head with a stone and it would
[03:07:51.880 --> 03:07:57.480]  you know you'd be laid down yeah and like in the way that in the first movie the empire overlooked
[03:07:57.480 --> 03:08:01.720]  the possibility of what do they call them snub fighters being something to worry about you can
[03:08:01.720 --> 03:08:10.600]  say what are they called stunt fighters whatever they call them uh that the empire sort of there's
[03:08:10.600 --> 03:08:14.840]  an implicit racism to the empire because everybody in the empire is exactly you can see them
[03:08:14.840 --> 03:08:19.400]  overlooking the force of wookiees as being something that like that and and really if they
[03:08:19.400 --> 03:08:24.840]  had a bigger budget or like more extras like if they had cg basically they what they may not
[03:08:24.840 --> 03:08:28.760]  realize that many occupying forces don't realize is that you are vastly outnumbered by the needed
[03:08:28.760 --> 03:08:32.040]  little furry things and you know that it doesn't matter how much technology you have the wookiees
[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:36.440]  being used as slaves and then like overthrow that there's way more interesting things you could have
[03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:40.680]  done with that movie anyway they didn't but that said the at least that battle makes sense and
[03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:47.960]  certainly the uh the space engagement makes a lot of sense because the rebels get totally i mean
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:52.840]  i mean it's it's a trap it's a trap and it works you know because they have a plan they execute on
[03:08:52.840 --> 03:08:57.000]  their plan their plan does not go as planned because the emperor knew about that that's a
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:02.360]  typical you know like in any type of war type scenario where you you do have plans for the
[03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:05.720]  battle seemed to be dramatic you can't simply execute your plan and then win in the end you
[03:09:05.720 --> 03:09:09.320]  have to have you know oh things are going badly we thought this was going to be our plan but it
[03:09:09.320 --> 03:09:14.280]  turns out the death star is active and oh here's the entire uh empire's fleet and we have a serious
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:19.560]  serious problem they get trapped between the imperial fleet and an entirely operational
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:26.120]  death star not a good place to be all of all of these battles make sense but let's go to the
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:30.360]  total equals well i would say this just let me say before we go to the prequels let me say this
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:35.720]  that in the first trilogy let's say it takes place over roughly six years which is what the movies
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:40.200]  took place you know in real life to make them takes place over six years the the three movies
[03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:45.400]  spend an inordinate number most of their time on the most interesting things that happened in the
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:51.480]  whole galaxy in those six years the space battles that took place were monumentally important like
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:57.880]  historically and the personal scenes are about the most important people in the galaxy at that time
[03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:04.680]  right now go to the original trilogy which takes place over like more more than six years
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:08.920]  pre-culture what is it yeah it's like it's got to be 20 something what did the
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:16.600]  well is like seven and then he's like 10 years okay ten years yeah maybe a little something
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:25.080]  at the beginning of it there's a gap there's a galactic senate and there's a jedi order that
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:30.040]  seems to order you know number in like the thousands and by the end of it the entire
[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:36.840]  jedi order is wiped out and the republic is replaced by an empire they spend like a grand
[03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:43.560]  total of like two and a half minutes on screen showing the jedi order being wiped out and you
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:49.480]  know the emperor just says he's the emperor so they they just the the most interesting things
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:53.240]  that you would think they would show over the trilogy they cover in about two and a half minutes
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:11:01.560]  they don't know what they're doing so okay the battle in phantom menace one uh the oh god the
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:07.160]  the gungans the gungans versus the droids uh boring because you're fighting on a flat plane
[03:11:07.160 --> 03:11:11.560]  but whatever you got the shields and it's kind of cool in a weird roman phalanx kind of way
[03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:16.440]  until whatever until it falls apart and
[03:11:16.440 --> 03:11:24.200]  they're throwing big glowy purple balls yeah like it starts out kind of cool when they start
[03:11:24.200 --> 03:11:28.760]  deploying the army it's like i don't know why you'd fight in the field given this kind of level
[03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:33.960]  attack and they're whatever they were they were fighting on the windows xp exactly exactly and
[03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:39.800]  and you know the idea that they're fighting droids that you know if their control ship
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:44.600]  goes off their head yeah it doesn't make sense so the space battle is inane completely inane
[03:11:44.600 --> 03:11:50.680]  they're going after what the control ship and it's stupid and and and it gets lucky like he
[03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:58.040]  doesn't even get smart he's just fine it's it's horrible uh so that can't touch and even can't
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:03.480]  even touch the ewok battle like it's it's night and day worse than that they care more about the
[03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:07.080]  ewoks than you do about any of the gungans or anybody of course you do yeah the ewoks have a
[03:12:07.080 --> 03:12:11.720]  touching moment where the guy in the glider gets shot down and the other ewoks like yeah and you'd
[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:15.560]  establish them as characters of like capturing them and bringing them back and discussing them
[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:20.280]  being convinced by you know c3po that he's a god and to let them go and i think it works in their
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:25.160]  favor that you can't understand what they're saying because yeah well and there was the one
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:31.160]  guy who got he there was like an explosion that goes off in the one ewok yes he rubs the other
[03:12:31.160 --> 03:12:35.240]  one there's a little maudlin i mean they look it's a little yeah yeah it's getting it's getting over
[03:12:35.240 --> 03:12:40.920]  there but but at least it's at least there's some sense that there are serious stakes yeah and you
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:48.840]  killed one of the cutest things on screen that's you know that's something um in the second one
[03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:54.760]  we have the inane yeah beginning of the clone wars whatever i don't want to talk about that
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:13:00.280]  because none of them make sense uh what they they how did all those jedis just walk in there i don't
[03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:09.720]  know who knows why would you i'm not a really tactical savvy guy but if i was 500 jedis i would
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:15.560]  not walk into the middle of an arena if everything can just shoot me it's like they so wanted to have
[03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:20.760]  a you know roman coliseum good guys versus the lions type of thing yeah it's alien lines and
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:26.520]  exciting you just have it in this big stadium and yeah like the only the only cool thing about that
[03:13:26.520 --> 03:13:32.440]  is that uh vietnam era uh helicopter gunship coming in with all the stormtroopers the clone
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:38.680]  troopers basically shooting all the bad guys and kind of trying to dust like trying to extract
[03:13:38.680 --> 03:13:43.160]  the surviving battles that's the only thing it's the same problem as the first battles is like
[03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:48.360]  i don't care about either side of these battles like i vaguely know that the good guys are the
[03:13:48.360 --> 03:13:52.360]  guy with yoda and i know they want to do like the well the good guys are using stormtroopers isn't
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:58.520]  that weird but you don't care it's just a bunch of things it's like it's like uh what do you call it
[03:13:58.520 --> 03:14:02.520]  man of steel just people banging against each other but it's more than that whatever i guess
[03:14:02.520 --> 03:14:08.040]  though but it's more than that they get tactic tactically stupider as the movies go on so as
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:13.800]  soon as they dust off they land and the the jedis end up taking squads of stormtroopers
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:20.360]  and the stormtroopers the clone troopers are a finite resource they've been cloned over what
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:28.680]  10 years uh against an advancing droid army and what do they do they just run at them they just
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:35.000]  run at them like flat out run at a bunch of robots that we've seen a factory pumping them out by the
[03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:43.240]  hundreds like it's it's it's the dumbest thing ever it's well this is a george lucasism in the
[03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:48.760]  entire movies the idea and everybody succumbs to this especially older people but the idea that
[03:14:49.320 --> 03:14:54.360]  the uh well not everybody i mean james cameron has the idea that the droid army is obviously going
[03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:58.360]  to be inferior to even clones because living things are so much smarter than droids enjoy
[03:14:58.360 --> 03:15:02.360]  yeah but living things are smarter because they will duck and take cover and shoot at the dumb
[03:15:02.360 --> 03:15:06.520]  ass robots well but that's the idea like there's so many droids in the droid army that even the
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:10.120]  gunkins can defeat them and when it's the clones versus the droids even though there's a factor
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:14.680]  turning them out obviously the living thing is gonna win and i think the much more likely and
[03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:18.120]  reasonable scenario is the terminator one is like no the machines win because they're really good
[03:15:18.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  at killing yes that that would be my it's like at least take cover that's why the living thing
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:28.520]  wins because it's got a sense of self-preservation effectively and here's where we get to where i
[03:15:28.520 --> 03:15:34.840]  want to just murder every wookie i see i don't see a lot so that's okay um
[03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:43.480]  yoda is on kashik the the wookie homeworld in the third movie and the droid army is coming
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:50.200]  and for whatever reason um the droid army has decided to cross a lake or a river or whatever
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:57.160]  it is and um land on a beach and the beach is covered on two sides by elevated cliffs
[03:15:57.160 --> 03:16:03.000]  and on the top of the cliffs are a bunch of clones with machine guns or whatever the hell it is like
[03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:11.640]  blasters and on a trench on the beach are a whole bunch of wookies with all of their bowcasters and
[03:16:11.640 --> 03:16:17.320]  their badass stuff and then the droids start coming and as they get onto the beach
[03:16:18.680 --> 03:16:20.920]  the wookiees in the trench what do you think they do
[03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:26.840]  jump up out of the trench and run at the wookiees in the water and run at the droids in the water
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:33.640]  you're in a trench shoot the robots don't why would you jump out of the trench why it's it's
[03:16:33.640 --> 03:16:41.720]  horrible it's like it is it is like it's it's the most revolting that not revolting but it's
[03:16:41.720 --> 03:16:46.360]  like we've gone we've gone from a completely understandable really complicated scenario
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:51.800]  of assaulting a death star with multiple fighter squadrons into such a simple scenario where it's
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:56.760]  like these living things should probably not jump out of cover why would why did you bother
[03:16:56.760 --> 03:17:02.840]  building the trench i've often said about like the roger morrier bond movies that he he gets
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:08.120]  you know like when he gets captured and is you know facing seeming certain death he doesn't even
[03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:13.320]  seem perturbed he's not worried he's not sweaty and he it's like he acts as though he's a
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:17.560]  character who's read the rest of the script and knows knows he's getting out of it like it's like
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:21.320]  the wookiees knew like well we read that we don't get shot so we'll just run right it doesn't make
[03:17:21.320 --> 03:17:25.080]  sense it's it's so they didn't have they didn't have good analogs for the because the other
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:29.160]  movies you had analogs for your world war two dog fights yeah or like we just said in star trek you
[03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:34.040]  had naval battles right so you have sam samurai sword fights you have analogs right and so the
[03:17:34.040 --> 03:17:37.880]  analog obvious analog for infantry there's plenty of analogs for them depending on what you want to
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:42.920]  do they just chose not to do any of them so one analog for infantry is the one analog for the
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:46.760]  one analog is like the lord of the rings thing where you can do a medieval right formation type
[03:17:46.760 --> 03:17:52.760]  of you know which they kind of did in fact of all the lord of the ring movies including the hobbit
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:56.840]  ones and everything like they did a reasonable job of saying here is something that looks vaguely
[03:17:56.840 --> 03:18:01.000]  like a maneuver that might have been done by large standing armies with medieval weapons whatever
[03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:06.360]  they may be protective patterns with shields the use of your your your bowman and the use of
[03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:10.520]  cavalry and mounted things stuff like that and there's plenty of analogs to choose from in star
[03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:15.640]  wars one like they do have trenches like they were doing that you know they did it on the housing it's
[03:18:15.640 --> 03:18:20.200]  just that they're like at a certain point they're like okay here's a setup but rather than trying
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:26.920]  to sort of model footage from similar large infantry battles we'll just do whatever seems
[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:33.240]  the most dramatic and what he's leaping from the barricades seems it's it's it's bananas it
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:37.560]  well my complaint with that is that i didn't know any of those yeah i didn't care whether they won
[03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:41.000]  i didn't care about it like i don't care about anything that's going on there it's just like
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:45.320]  well that's it i think i have more i have more investment in video game i think yes exactly i
[03:18:45.320 --> 03:18:50.840]  think you might have had they acted in any kind of way that made any kind of sense at all i think
[03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:59.080]  there's probably characters or at least um uh i was about to say npc's but uh whatever extras
[03:18:59.080 --> 03:19:04.280]  in empire strikes back that you are more interested in than any of those wookies that
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:09.240]  the like like you know the guy that presses the remote control button that fires that cannon at
[03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:16.920]  the uh the adat leg in empire strikes back yeah but that was yeah but see the thing is that was
[03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:20.840]  a battle that was happening around our heroes who we care about this thing that the prequels do
[03:19:21.560 --> 03:19:26.840]  that they had at the end of jedi as well is it's pointless there's a survey a survey of conflicts
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:31.320]  happening across the galaxy not involving anybody you care about it's like they needed to express
[03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:36.120]  the idea of we've given this order and everywhere on every planet and each other there are being
[03:19:36.120 --> 03:19:40.120]  killed and so it's like a survey of like on this planet these people are fighting on this planet
[03:19:40.120 --> 03:19:43.480]  these people are fighting yeah on this planet and that does not make a movie that doesn't even make
[03:19:43.480 --> 03:19:48.280]  a good documentary ken burns with that slide like you have to you have to have investment in the
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:52.280]  conflict and you can briefly show that maybe something else is going on elsewhere like they
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:56.920]  do this in disaster movies like in the beginning they showed that the the crumbling of civilization
[03:19:56.920 --> 03:20:02.520]  but that's just like a brief aside to the main story it can't be the your climax can't be a
[03:20:02.520 --> 03:20:06.520]  survey of battles happening on other planets suffice it to say the good guys the bad guys
[03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:10.040]  are fighting people everywhere and we will tell through music cues or whatever which side is
[03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:14.760]  winning i don't care is anybody here that i care about where are my heroes do i care about any of
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:21.160]  these movies like imagine if the first and only time we meet sunny and the godfather is two
[03:20:21.160 --> 03:20:27.320]  minutes before he rashly leaves and you know goes through the they would just show all the death
[03:20:27.320 --> 03:20:30.200]  scenes they wouldn't show the movie before and they'd be like these guys killed that guy that
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:35.720]  guy killed in a revolving door this guy got killed at a toll booth it's like yeah so and we we care
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:40.760]  about sunny in the toll booth because we've seen him in two hours and we've seen him before act
[03:20:40.760 --> 03:20:47.400]  out of bad temper and you know we don't want to be he's kind of a bad guy but we still kind of like
[03:20:47.400 --> 03:20:51.960]  him you know and it's you know it's like the culmination of michael's plan is all those other
[03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:55.960]  people dying it's because we realize it's the culmination of plan we know who those people are
[03:20:55.960 --> 03:21:00.440]  we you know and and we understand how he has coordinated all this to happen when he is
[03:21:00.440 --> 03:21:04.200]  he is in some place that is essentially untouchable while it's going on and by the time he gets out
[03:21:04.200 --> 03:21:11.240]  it's all settled right he spent the entire three movies showing the wrong stuff and developing the
[03:21:11.240 --> 03:21:17.560]  wrong stuff and then just rushed through with therefore with no emotional impact whatsoever
[03:21:17.560 --> 03:21:21.240]  these characters who should have been developed we had three whole movies where they could have
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:28.520]  developed i let's just say six jedi six different jedi who in the course of three movies could have
[03:21:28.520 --> 03:21:34.360]  been made into real characters with varying flaws and personalities and then they die at the end or
[03:21:34.360 --> 03:21:38.280]  you just show like even if you did that or you just show whatever is happening to the characters
[03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:44.920]  that we supposedly care about and have them have them established to be i care about the jedi and
[03:21:44.920 --> 03:21:49.080]  have them hear that the jedi are dying elsewhere you don't need to show them because if they don't
[03:21:49.080 --> 03:21:53.480]  care about them like you can have heroes in situations where they find out that bad things
[03:21:53.480 --> 03:21:56.920]  are happening elsewhere but you don't need to show the bad things happening else you can just show
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:00.760]  that my main characters care about this therefore i care about it but it's not so important so how
[03:22:00.760 --> 03:22:05.320]  do we how do we feel about the execution of order 66 because i thought that was actually one of the
[03:22:05.320 --> 03:22:14.280]  most effective uh i you know i feel like there should have been a musical uh you know uh like
[03:22:15.720 --> 03:22:21.960]  what do they call them like a like a not a segue like a uh a motif yeah i i keep thinking about
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:25.000]  goodfellas when uh when he's trying to get the cocaine all sort of that
[03:22:27.640 --> 03:22:33.320]  now you can you can sell any of that like but you have to have you can if you have a better movie
[03:22:33.320 --> 03:22:39.320]  leading up to it how you communicate that uh a coordinated attack is taking place with essentially
[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:43.480]  you know brainwashed clones who are always you know it's like the manchurian candidate like oh
[03:22:43.480 --> 03:22:46.600]  trigger this and they all just do this order they all have they all know this order and the order
[03:22:46.600 --> 03:22:52.280]  comes they kill all the jedi fine you can you can do that in lots of different ways but you need to
[03:22:52.280 --> 03:22:57.720]  show uh the people who care about that we care about these people and these people care that all
[03:22:57.720 --> 03:23:02.120]  the jedi are being killed and that's what you need but it did kind of work it was it was hamfisted
[03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:09.480]  but we had seen many of those jedi do stuff or at least being in the background right yeah they
[03:23:09.480 --> 03:23:13.400]  didn't have many lines they sat around a table they they smiled they they helped out in some
[03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:17.080]  other movies and now they're now they're getting gunned down they played sad music but it's just
[03:23:17.080 --> 03:23:23.400]  like yeah yeah it doesn't matter and some of them you can't do it at that point you either earned
[03:23:23.400 --> 03:23:29.880]  it or you haven't and they did yeah yeah which which brings us to the end of of that movie and
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:34.200]  it's the whole end of the whole trilogy and it's the whole reason that the prequel trilogy was
[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:40.360]  even made which was to set up the middle trilogy which was already established and it had to
[03:23:40.360 --> 03:23:46.840]  therefore had to leave us in a certain place and had to explain certain things the whole point of
[03:23:46.840 --> 03:23:51.640]  it this is the whole point this is the only reason that the prequel trilogy was even made or written
[03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:58.360]  and it makes no goddamn sense whatsoever so let's just say let's just give it up that all the most
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:24:05.800]  of the jedi have been uh extinguished their dead uh exit order 66 killed them but obi-wan and yoda
[03:24:05.800 --> 03:24:12.440]  are still together well yeah and and they figure out what's going on they know who the emperor is
[03:24:13.720 --> 03:24:23.080]  so why in the world would they split up why wouldn't they either a go get go after i would
[03:24:23.080 --> 03:24:28.840]  i would suggest that the first thing they should do is go after anakin together well first of all
[03:24:28.840 --> 03:24:34.680]  i think maybe they think anakin's dead at that point or at least a non-factor no they decide
[03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:39.800]  yoda's oh sorry before obi-wan's gonna go i thought you meant after like at the end when they
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:45.400]  when they uh rendezvous on what becomes no but that doesn't make any sense either but before that
[03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:49.720]  when they decide who to fight if they decide we should get the emperor first they should go
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:54.520]  together if they decide we should go take care of anakin either see if we can turn them back to the
[03:24:54.520 --> 03:25:02.280]  good side or do something with them why in the world would they it makes no sense whatsoever not
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:09.320]  the only conceivable rationale for that is that if you act swiftly and by surprise and take out
[03:25:09.320 --> 03:25:15.480]  both of them maybe that counts for something but no i would just go i would take you out and go
[03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:23.160]  talk to your anakin like to see it's if you have to if you have to kill him yoda could do it you
[03:25:23.160 --> 03:25:30.520]  know like and even while i i mean konobi even says on stage on stage on screen that uh he can't kill
[03:25:30.520 --> 03:25:36.120]  him and then yoda says no go do it like why why would you why would you assign him that like he's
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:43.800]  already basically said that it's not gonna be but then even given that the asinine nature of their
[03:25:43.800 --> 03:25:48.600]  let's split up even though there's only two of us left and you know right now we have the we could
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:52.600]  have the element of surprise and go if there's any chance that one of us could beat the emperor
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:57.480]  surely we have a better chance together we could do it right now even if you take that just let
[03:25:57.480 --> 03:26:03.400]  him do that and say yoda fights the emperor and obi-wan fights vader and thinks he kills him
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:11.800]  even then afterwards you find out well obi-wan did almost kill vader and and like left him deformed
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:17.480]  and semi-crippled and yoda at least fought the emperor to a standstill kind of and then they
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:22.680]  decide well well now we'll just now we'll just spend 20 years yeah it seems like they could have
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:27.880]  teamed up and taken out the emperor at that point right like yoda did come like pretty close to
[03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:34.760]  taking him out especially since their plan wasn't okay you go take luke to tatooine hide him from
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:38.440]  the emperor and slowly train him as a jedi that wasn't their plan either because it was like you
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:42.200]  go hide in tatooine luke will be there keep your eye on them but don't try to actually train them
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:46.680]  up for it like what are they waiting for what was what was their what was their plan for victory
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:51.720]  right at the moment that they split up and went into hiding they both had fought they
[03:26:51.720 --> 03:26:58.360]  wanted defeated the other and obi-wan had soundly defeated vader and yoda had fought the emperor to
[03:26:58.360 --> 03:27:03.000]  a standstill i would say and certainly i would say given that he fought him to an almost standstill
[03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:09.400]  if they went after him together obi-wan and yoda you you know i like their chances see like by the
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:15.480]  time a new hope comes in an empire what what those movies say is that yoda had checked out he he had
[03:27:15.480 --> 03:27:22.760]  a colossal failure institutional failure to deal with the whole you know he he was he has failed
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:26.680]  and as he thought he could you know be the head of the light side and you know so he's basically
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:31.160]  not in exile but he's like he's given up and he's gone off to live in the woods right so he's
[03:27:31.160 --> 03:27:35.960]  checked out right and obi-wan same thing he's a crazy old man he loves that and both of them are
[03:27:35.960 --> 03:27:41.640]  like we are defeated this is our great shame the best obi-wan can do is to make sure luke continues
[03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:46.040]  to hide from the emperor hope he never exhibits any force powers keep him down on the farm and
[03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:50.280]  then at the very least he can say at least i'm keeping these kids safe but the empire has won we
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:55.240]  are defeated we have no plan for victory but like you said at the end of stupid episode three they're
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:28:00.600]  not in that headspace they are not both so massively defeated and so crushed by their own
[03:28:00.600 --> 03:28:04.600]  personal failings that they check out entirely from the conflict and say well this is never
[03:28:04.600 --> 03:28:10.040]  going to change it's going to go off somewhere hide and die right exactly exactly i had i just
[03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:14.680]  assumed even as i was suffering through those prequels i was like something's going to happen
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:21.000]  at the end of this that's going to leave obi-wan and yoda both like morally defeated and instead
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:26.600]  they both left like oh my god we were so close not not only so close like if you were going to
[03:28:26.600 --> 03:28:29.960]  kill anakin he was right there you could have killed him it's not like you didn't know he was
[03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:33.640]  still alive did you just assume he would die it's like a game of the bondville and it's like well
[03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:37.880]  i'll just assume this machine will kill you mr bond i'm gonna leave the room now yeah when i see
[03:28:37.880 --> 03:28:43.640]  you later in the movie i'll be genuinely surprised i do i do kind of understand the notion of not
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:47.960]  wanting to murder anakin in cold blood which is effectively what it would have been but then you
[03:28:47.960 --> 03:28:53.400]  say well exactly you either save him or once he catches fire maybe you walk back down an embankment
[03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:56.760]  and just it's like the most morally cowardly thing it's like i'm not going to kill you but if
[03:28:56.760 --> 03:29:01.000]  you happen to slide into that lava a little farther yeah that's horrible it's what it is
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:09.080]  just awful no i mean no wonder he's ends up extra pissed off yeah and i hated that fight between um
[03:29:10.200 --> 03:29:15.880]  uh yoda and the emperor that was awful that was just awful yeah i liked when yoda walked in and
[03:29:15.880 --> 03:29:21.960]  just just totally destroyed the two uh imperial guards the emperor is a emperor is a fun guy to
[03:29:21.960 --> 03:29:27.720]  watch fight because he's kind of ugly and he was he was fine when the four jedi showed up when the
[03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:33.480]  jedi showed up to arrest him i was fine with that uh because i liked the fact that he actually would
[03:29:33.480 --> 03:29:38.920]  i could see him using a lightsaber because well a a a he's normal height so it's not that obscure
[03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:45.240]  but i also like the notion that he's just hasn't quite reached that level of enlightenment yet that
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:51.400]  he doesn't need one yoda always strikes me as somebody who's just well before these like the
[03:29:51.400 --> 03:29:55.560]  emperor seemed kind of like the emperor seemed kind of feral exactly i liked when the emperor
[03:29:55.560 --> 03:29:59.800]  and yoda were fighting and yoda was like using the force to move heavy things and the emperor was
[03:29:59.800 --> 03:30:04.680]  you know shooting at him lightning or whatever yeah well yeah yeah uh although the lightning
[03:30:04.680 --> 03:30:09.960]  ultimately screws him up doesn't he he gets he gets thrown off and his little nails get stuck
[03:30:09.960 --> 03:30:16.280]  into the that's a good question i i've never seen a good jonas and i have talked about that a lot so
[03:30:16.280 --> 03:30:22.120]  that we've never even mentioned mace windu who who to me i love sam jackson a waste of sam exactly
[03:30:22.120 --> 03:30:28.200]  yeah wait what a waste of him yeah what a waste because he's awesome and he could have been a bad
[03:30:28.200 --> 03:30:33.000]  guy or he's got a room some kind of weird bonin jedi he's awesome and he's also in he's also into
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:37.080]  star wars he wanted to be in the movies and what he was given is like he does a bad job with the
[03:30:37.080 --> 03:30:40.680]  line readings he has no charisma to the character the character has nothing to do he doesn't seem
[03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:45.240]  like a badass it's just like how can sam jackson not seem like a badass well well he seems more
[03:30:45.240 --> 03:30:51.320]  badass than anybody else if only because everybody else is completely wooden so there is a cool thing
[03:30:51.320 --> 03:30:56.440]  in that scene where they go to confront the emperor and the emperor just jumps at them with
[03:30:56.440 --> 03:31:01.720]  a weird fighting style like you said feral is perfect and i love the way that he like killed
[03:31:01.720 --> 03:31:06.360]  four of them in like 10 seconds like he's so badass and there's never been a lightsaber fight
[03:31:06.360 --> 03:31:11.480]  like that every other lightsaber fight we've ever seen up until this point was dramatic and had ebbs
[03:31:11.480 --> 03:31:16.920]  and flows and even like when duku in the second movie was kind of dominant over obi-wan and
[03:31:16.920 --> 03:31:20.840]  anakin it took him a while it took him a while to cut off anakin's hand it took him a while
[03:31:20.840 --> 03:31:25.800]  to get obi-wan you know pinned under a column whereas the emperor is such a badass boom boom
[03:31:25.800 --> 03:31:32.120]  boom yeah yeah i mean they they light their lights and then they're on the floor like that's this
[03:31:32.120 --> 03:31:36.200]  this is the thing about the fight scenes in all these movies if you're going to have a fight scene
[03:31:36.200 --> 03:31:40.200]  unless your movie is about fighting styles unless it's like a one of those classic kung-fu movies
[03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:43.320]  where the whole freaking movie is about i'm going to learn crane technique and i'm going to learn
[03:31:43.320 --> 03:31:46.440]  the tiger technique and my technique is better than your technique and i'm going to train in
[03:31:46.440 --> 03:31:51.000]  a monastery like unless your whole freaking movie is about fighting techniques the fight can't be
[03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:55.080]  about who is a better fighter the fight has to be about something else and in the case of the the
[03:31:55.080 --> 03:32:00.360]  emperor going feral the the part of that fight that was dramatic is the emperor is revealed he's
[03:32:00.360 --> 03:32:03.960]  revealed in a sudden fashion the people who are there are surprised that he's revealed it is not
[03:32:03.960 --> 03:32:09.160]  about how exactly he defeats those people when you have ember versus yoda it's not about who is
[03:32:09.160 --> 03:32:13.080]  stronger and who is not the fight always has to be about something else because and again unless
[03:32:13.080 --> 03:32:16.680]  your movie is a kung-fu movie where you're actually concentrating on fighting styles
[03:32:16.680 --> 03:32:19.880]  you always have to have the fight be be about something else in the fight because that's what
[03:32:19.880 --> 03:32:24.360]  happens we're not we're not like otherwise you just have a movie where people have a conflict
[03:32:24.360 --> 03:32:27.560]  and then they just have a long grown out sword fight and the winner of the sword fight wins the
[03:32:27.560 --> 03:32:31.160]  movie that can't be what the fight is about the fight it has to be about something else and they
[03:32:31.160 --> 03:32:35.000]  just have to happen to be fighting to work out whatever else it doesn't mean they need to have
[03:32:35.000 --> 03:32:39.080]  a conversation the whole time in the fight princess bride style or anything but like they
[03:32:39.080 --> 03:32:43.080]  do the fight has to be about well like yeah the emperor killing all those people the fight that
[03:32:43.080 --> 03:32:48.040]  that particular fight is about i am revealed this is me i bet you're surprised this old guy can do
[03:32:48.040 --> 03:32:52.520]  this and here i am and quickly kill them and one and once that is done the fight is well so here's
[03:32:52.520 --> 03:32:57.000]  the thing with that i mean i i totally agree with you and i think that goes back to the point i was
[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:02.760]  trying to make about the the battles is that you know without anything any skin in the game it just
[03:33:02.760 --> 03:33:10.440]  really doesn't matter um really the only character that showed up to arrest uh palpatine was windu
[03:33:11.320 --> 03:33:14.920]  the other guys were just fodder to prove that like whoa this guy's serious
[03:33:15.720 --> 03:33:22.520]  and you know sure enough he dispatched them and and you know like popcorn they didn't they didn't
[03:33:22.520 --> 03:33:27.000]  matter the the actual fight came down to windu and and palpatine and i thought it was actually
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:32.440]  pretty good fight i did too i actually think it was the only like the the best part of the whole
[03:33:32.440 --> 03:33:38.120]  because i think they both had something at stake it certainly windu represented uh the old school
[03:33:39.000 --> 03:33:44.840]  uh strict jedi order and and palpatine was you know more so than the yoda palpatine fight because it
[03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:52.280]  you know my interpretation of the way that scene went was that mace windu is indeed a badass
[03:33:52.280 --> 03:33:57.880]  maybe he's even more powerful than yoda uh because he's at least at the there is a line in sword
[03:33:57.880 --> 03:34:03.880]  fighting i think anakin delivers it says something like i will be i want to be a better uh sword
[03:34:03.880 --> 03:34:10.120]  fighter than mace windu then master windu something like or maybe yeah they definitely
[03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:15.400]  shout out to to windu to be like yoda was always held up in that whatever this conversation was
[03:34:15.400 --> 03:34:24.280]  yoda was always held up yeah yeah there is one that shout outs that that uh sort of props
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:30.040]  windu up as being a badass and i forget what it is yeah but like but sam jackson the actor could
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:33.640]  not deliver on that because i guess they didn't have enough body doubles forever he just looked
[03:34:33.640 --> 03:34:39.800]  kind of old and tired i like the way well i kind of like that because i i kind of like the idea
[03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:45.320]  that i mean he hasn't really been well actually we just saw him fighting the second one i was i
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:49.880]  was going to say i thought it was like he yeah i don't know i liked it because it was less
[03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:54.760]  frenetic and you could just sort of see them yeah battling palpatine was seeing my interpretation
[03:34:55.720 --> 03:35:01.320]  yeah well my interpretation of the cino is that windu actually actually got the better of him and
[03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:08.520]  that emperor palpatine was not sandbagging he was desperate and that the only way he could save
[03:35:08.520 --> 03:35:13.960]  himself the only way was if he could completely if he could complete anakin's turn to the dark side
[03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:21.160]  it either he could turn anakin and and have anakin you know knock windu out the window or cut off his
[03:35:21.160 --> 03:35:27.320]  arm whatever he did first or he was dead palpatine was a loser his only chance had nothing he couldn't
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:32.760]  beat mace windu in the fight he'd lost so the only way he could win was to complete anakin's turn that
[03:35:32.760 --> 03:35:38.680]  was that was my view i think when do but to me it's a failure of the filmmaking that it's not
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:42.440]  clear that those were the stakes and i always thought he was sandbagging a little bit just
[03:35:42.440 --> 03:35:47.480]  because that's kind of his mo where he was like you know it's hard to say manipulate anakin
[03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.720]  that's my take but i have to admit that the other take that he was sandbagging
[03:35:51.720 --> 03:35:57.400]  and he could have up the force on windu at any moment you know yeah but it's sloppy
[03:35:57.400 --> 03:36:01.480]  filmmaking for that to be ambiguous it's probably not intended to be ambiguous it's like but then
[03:36:01.480 --> 03:36:07.800]  in my reading it was him when he was shooting the force lightning at windu and windu was successfully
[03:36:07.800 --> 03:36:14.040]  blocking it with his lightsaber it and his that's when he got deformed and you know that was him
[03:36:14.040 --> 03:36:18.280]  like deplete depleting his own life force like he i don't think he wanted to be disfigured it
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:23.960]  wasn't like it was his true form he's not a shapeshifter he was like wrecking himself
[03:36:24.680 --> 03:36:29.160]  because he was so desperate you know he was giving it everything he had and even everything he had
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:34.680]  wasn't enough to to beat me that's my take too if only because again he deforms himself
[03:36:34.680 --> 03:36:39.800]  but i really do think that it's just it's just a a condemnation of the filmmaking that it's
[03:36:39.800 --> 03:36:45.560]  ambiguous because this at the same level when you know the the culmination in return of the jedi
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:49.640]  it's all very clear what the stakes are and emperor so there's emperor couldn't beat mace
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:53.800]  windu and one on one combat he also couldn't beat yoda like it at best you could say both of them
[03:36:53.800 --> 03:36:59.320]  came to draws or maybe mace at the upper hand but that doesn't make sense in the context of
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:04.760]  the later movies the idea that the emperor is the top of the heap on the dark side
[03:37:04.760 --> 03:37:10.120]  and you would assume that one on one the emperor could take out any of the single light side people
[03:37:10.120 --> 03:37:15.960]  simply because the dark side you know not more powerful but like in terms of killing people
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:20.440]  like you know how do you get to be the head of the sith well we also don't know how it works
[03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:25.160]  it could be like a peter pan thing where every time you believe in a sith guy he gets more
[03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:30.280]  powerful you know like yeah i don't know like is basically the question is is the emperor at the
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:34.920]  end of return of the jedi more powerful than the emperor in episode right and who knows also who
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:40.760]  cares because yeah i would say yes i i think so too just because it's like the sith get like more
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:44.680]  powerful as they get old and more evil yeah because i mean he's had 20 years to get better
[03:37:44.680 --> 03:37:50.760]  at being a badass right or maybe not with his lightsaber but at least with his you know his
[03:37:50.760 --> 03:37:56.920]  research into being evil well no because i mean he you know they talk about that at the opera
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:02.280]  that's a great scene by the way well great it's it's it's relatively good as given it yeah it's
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:07.480]  nonsensical although like how are you manipulating him oh there was this dude who could stop people
[03:38:07.480 --> 03:38:12.200]  from dying did you ever care about somebody maybe you should slaughter children but it's it's tense
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:16.680]  it's at an opera which i thought was kind of interesting i like the stuff going on
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:24.280]  artistically yeah but like and the actor what's his name he's good he's creepy he's one of the
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:28.280]  better actors in the prequel trilogy who despite the fact that he's given stupid things to say
[03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:35.080]  delivery yeah i regret saying great it's great in the you know in the toilet bowl in which it
[03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:40.280]  swims it's actually a pretty it's it's pretty good isn't it great though isn't it so telling
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:48.280]  though that like in the first trilogy the original trilogy everybody was at least clamoring for these
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:53.880]  backstory prequels of well how did vader get like this how did anakin turn to the dark side
[03:38:53.880 --> 03:38:59.880]  whereas after the prequels nobody was like well how did the emperor learn to be a sith while he
[03:38:59.880 --> 03:39:03.240]  was an up and coming politician that's the thing where you mentioned like in a new hope where like
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:08.360]  they offhandedly mentioned sorts of lots of things like clone war or an empire or mandel or
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:12.280]  the the you know all these things like they laid these little seeds of like oh you could flesh
[03:39:12.280 --> 03:39:16.200]  those out forward or backwards what seeds were laid in the prequels it's like the time began in
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:20.040]  the prequels like there was nothing mentioned in the prequels well it was about things that
[03:39:20.040 --> 03:39:26.440]  happened there was a darth sedius what was the name the uh the previous guy darth malus like the
[03:39:26.440 --> 03:39:32.440]  plague us or whatever seriously right but like but those are that's not that's actually spoken
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:36.440]  in the thing it's not like you know something casually mentioned that was like a major
[03:39:36.440 --> 03:39:40.760]  plot point where they're describing a backstory right like the one and only thing i could think
[03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:45.560]  of that i'd kind of wanted to know more about was this i have no idea how thank you for bringing
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:51.800]  that up because that none of it makes right he was a jedi who somehow commissioned a building of
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:57.560]  the was he or was he killed by duku and then duku posed as him it's just too much exposition for
[03:39:57.560 --> 03:40:02.360]  like there's just too much plot happening or like the structure isn't sturdy and then they hang
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:06.600]  tinsels and ornaments all over the freaking thing until it's just a big giant mess and it's like you
[03:40:06.600 --> 03:40:12.120]  didn't even have good bone structure under there and now now and seriously like a clone army of i
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:16.920]  don't know how many strong it's got to be hundreds of thousands right from what we see just appears
[03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:25.800]  and the galactic republic is like oh cool let's just use these guys what like that's mind-boggling
[03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:31.080]  like clones aren't humans it doesn't matter about the clones it doesn't matter even if you're
[03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:38.760]  comparable to it's like that many it's not a matter of what it's worse than that it's it's
[03:40:38.760 --> 03:40:42.680]  like saying if you wanted to have a standing army made entirely of identical twins that we'd be okay
[03:40:42.680 --> 03:40:46.520]  if they all got slaughtered because they're all genetically yeah so it's fine once you're
[03:40:46.520 --> 03:40:51.400]  genetically identical it's like well you don't even count you don't even count as human if
[03:40:51.400 --> 03:40:57.000]  anybody shares their genes with you you don't count as human yeah but even a guy like duku who
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:03.640]  has in broad strokes sounds like an interesting guy was a real jedi turned to the dark side left
[03:41:03.640 --> 03:41:08.680]  the or which you know what they make they make sound like no big deal oh he's he's an ex-jedi
[03:41:08.680 --> 03:41:14.680]  right possibly do that so that makes me think that ex-jedis are a thing yeah that's you know
[03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:20.600]  some guys leave and get yeah whatever they do yeah into yeah go into professional sports or something
[03:41:20.600 --> 03:41:28.120]  yeah they're still good guys but you know yeah you in broad strokes if you just defined the
[03:41:28.120 --> 03:41:32.280]  character before you showed me the movie i would think oh that's an interesting guy i would like
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:36.360]  to know more about him then you watch the movie and you're like i would i am not interested in
[03:41:36.360 --> 03:41:43.880]  the least bit in this broad caricature of uh evil well i have something for you and you know he's a
[03:41:43.880 --> 03:41:53.000]  robot with four arms and eight lightsabers how much how much less could you care about somebody
[03:41:54.840 --> 03:41:59.960]  well i like the idea of taking lightsabers from here that i like and you know what he worked well
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:05.240]  in that uh in that uh cell animation one that we were talking about at the top of the show
[03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:13.800]  i like that character uh and then i saw him in in in film and he's he stinks he's awful it's just
[03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:19.960]  yeah he was just empty he was just empty bad guy and they even reused the the the idea of having
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:26.360]  a respiratory problem from vader you know it's just a hodgepodge i do like the way he's dispatched
[03:42:26.360 --> 03:42:31.160]  by kenobi with a blaster because you get a cute you get a cute action hero line out of it
[03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:37.320]  yeah that wasn't that wasn't good but it you know wasn't bad yeah no well and it raises the question
[03:42:37.320 --> 03:42:45.480]  of how many um how many one-on-one duels can you fit in one movie i mean because that's really what
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:53.880]  that last movie devolved into is just one after it was pretty hilarious that um uh grievous just
[03:42:53.880 --> 03:43:02.280]  starts shit talking kenobi despite the fact that and he keeps doing it despite the fact that kenobi
[03:43:02.280 --> 03:43:07.480]  chopped off two of his arms ready and he's still he's still giving like you can't escape it's like
[03:43:07.480 --> 03:43:12.680]  i've just started cutting you to pieces i'm pretty sure i'm doing pretty good here like he jumps into
[03:43:12.680 --> 03:43:18.920]  like a a ring of a hundred droids and then just you know chops up the bad guy and the bad guy's
[03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:24.680]  still giving him shit like you know maybe turn that back a little bit so there's there's darth
[03:43:24.680 --> 03:43:30.600]  maul there's count duke who there's grievous and even the emperor himself you've got four major
[03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:34.920]  bad guys in the whole trilogy and there's not one of them who i would like to know more about
[03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:41.240]  you know or how he came to be who he is no you could combine them all into uh jankofit maybe
[03:43:41.240 --> 03:43:47.880]  yeah maybe maybe but i still think it's kind of a cheat that they just duplicated
[03:43:47.880 --> 03:43:55.720]  at least he meets a better end than his son yeah yeah all right i think we've gone on long enough
[03:43:55.720 --> 03:44:03.720]  this has been everything i could ask for more it's a true holiday spectacular um yeah oh thank
