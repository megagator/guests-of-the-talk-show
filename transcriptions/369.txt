[00:00.000 --> 00:08.160]  Over the weekend my coffee grinder broke and this is I've never lost a coffee grinder before
[00:08.160 --> 00:14.400]  and I quickly realized this is a single point of failure at my setup because I only have one I have
[00:14.400 --> 00:20.320]  never I've never had any reason to have a backup coffee grinder I have many different ways to brew
[00:20.320 --> 00:26.080]  coffee I have many different you know collections of coffee beans you know I have redundancy
[00:26.080 --> 00:31.120]  everywhere else in the system but the grinder is a single point of failure and after 12 years
[00:31.920 --> 00:38.080]  of solid use including the last six years in a highly corrosive saltwater air environment
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.000]  it finally kicked the bucket and I believe it's the same grinder I have the
[00:47.520 --> 00:53.440]  the Baratza Virtuosia I just like like every single piece of equipment I'm using to record
[00:53.440 --> 01:00.800]  this podcast I just said what should I buy Marco and I bought it and I have the same coffee grinder
[01:00.800 --> 01:07.520]  which I still love I don't know what I yeah I've got more local this is nothing against them because
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.000]  I mean look it lasted 12 years and you know again like the last six were in a pretty harsh
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.200]  environment for any kind of electronic you know thing made of metal so so I give it full credit
[01:17.200 --> 01:21.680]  and nothing against them but now see they don't make this model anymore they make a few that are
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.240]  kind of different and I don't know it like they're they're different in ways that I'm not sure would
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.600]  be better for me so I actually I ordered so first of all I overnighted a replacement because I'm
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.800]  like first of all this one you know my it broke on a Sunday and I'm like well it's gonna be a long
[01:36.800 --> 01:42.000]  time before I can get a coffee character in my house and I could also just you know go buy
[01:42.720 --> 01:49.600]  pre-ground beans but you know that's I'm not gonna do that so I'm lucky though I you know
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.760]  because I live in a beach town and it's the winter all my neighbors are gone for the season every
[01:55.760 --> 02:00.240]  it's basically an abandoned town right and I know my neighbors there and you know we all have like
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.360]  key to each other's houses so I actually asked and I I was able to go borrow my neighbor's coffee
[02:05.360 --> 02:11.040]  grinder you know getting it out of their abandoned house for the next few days so I have like you
[02:11.040 --> 02:14.240]  know back to like the regular like you know spinning blade kind of you know the little
[02:14.240 --> 02:20.640]  whirly bird grinder the old kind and I'm really happy that I have it it's better than nothing but
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.560]  man do I appreciate bird grinders more now it's a big difference turns out
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.720]  yeah so what do you what's your best local option off season
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.920]  I mean you can't there's nowhere to go really for decent coffee right or is there
[02:37.920 --> 02:44.800]  not really well I mean there's like you know towns on Long Island that I could I could drive
[02:44.800 --> 02:49.840]  no bridge that's too far but it's yeah it's like a half hour drive so it's not something I want to
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.800]  really do you know day to day so I just you know normally I just brew my own and it's fine you know
[02:54.800 --> 02:59.840]  I get the beans from yes please usually or from some kind of rando you know roaster from trade
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.200]  but I will say that the the coffee the coffee frozen cylinder thing that that's
[03:05.200 --> 03:11.920]  comiteer and I'm really frustrated by comiteer because I first heard about it on all consuming
[03:12.560 --> 03:19.280]  and I thought you know that's probably really stupid it's you know it's like frozen little
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.680]  capsules of coffee and you basically just pour hot water on them it's one of those companies
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.000]  that you'd see advertised on Instagram and you'd be like that's really fancy but that's probably
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.200]  not very good and for some reason I forget why but for some reason I decided to try it after
[03:33.200 --> 03:40.800]  I heard it on on on all consuming and it's like stupidly good and it's totally ridiculous like
[03:40.800 --> 03:47.120]  it's not super cheap and they have to mail you this box with a absolute ton of dry ice in it
[03:47.120 --> 03:50.960]  like it does stay frozen you know good for them not a sponsorship although I'm kind of hoping
[03:50.960 --> 03:56.880]  they'll sponsor my show at some point but um but it is like it's the most ridiculous way to get
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.280]  coffee because they have to basically ship you this extremely frozen box with these little you
[04:01.280 --> 04:06.800]  know aluminum capsules in it that you you know you defrost and they're single serving but it's
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.160]  frustrating because it's way way better than any coffee I've ever made myself like they just it's
[04:12.160 --> 04:18.000]  a really whatever whatever their process is it's like a fancy like hipster coffee shop made it
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.480]  you know like like with the fancy pour over but like with actual strength of flavor because you
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.520]  get to control how much dilution there is so it's stupidly good and I kind of I treat myself to that
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.480]  like every so often maybe like you know a couple times a year I'll get a box of those and I'll like
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.800]  slowly dole them out to enjoy them but you know to be your everyday pick I think it'd be kind of
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.360]  ridiculous so normally I'm just you know using you know beans mostly from yes please
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.480]  we may have to scrap this what happened trades trades one of the sponsors
[04:50.480 --> 04:58.960]  no I mean that's I said I also use beans from trade well let me take a break here
[05:01.040 --> 05:07.600]  and tell you about our first sponsor who Marco seredipitously is that the right word
[05:08.240 --> 05:15.760]  mentioned yeah something like that uh it's trade coffee trade this is not a joke this was not set
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.640]  up this show has no see what they're good for is variety because like normally like my my usual
[05:20.640 --> 05:26.400]  go-to is yes please and yes please is really good for if you want consistency they basically give
[05:26.400 --> 05:32.000]  you the same thing all the time and it's good but where I like trade is they give you variety well
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.040]  like if you want to like mix it up get something fresh get something new that's that's that's why
[05:37.040 --> 05:42.000]  I maintain subscriptions to both services and I just have them come in alternate weeks I have had
[05:42.000 --> 05:49.840]  trade coffee at your house I that was actually I remember the first morning over the summer I was
[05:49.840 --> 05:55.840]  you were kind enough to have us over for a couple of nights and I had it there but I'd already been
[05:55.840 --> 06:01.920]  subscribed often when I talk about trade coffee I say I'm drinking it right now but I can't say
[06:01.920 --> 06:07.120]  that right now because we're recording at eight o'clock at night and I I no longer am capable of
[06:07.120 --> 06:12.800]  drinking coffee at eight o'clock at night and I mean you got to sleep sometime and getting to bed
[06:12.800 --> 06:20.560]  I I've I used to be able to I used to think I was like one of the one of those and and they always
[06:20.560 --> 06:24.720]  said that that was one of the things the Russians used for jet fighter pilots you know everybody
[06:24.720 --> 06:29.280]  always knows fighter pilots have to have great eyesight and reflexes and stuff and the Russians
[06:29.280 --> 06:35.280]  chose pilots who had a very low susceptibility to caffeine so that they could have a better
[06:35.280 --> 06:40.800]  ability to caffeine so that they could like dose them with caffeine to keep them up for
[06:40.800 --> 06:47.680]  like 18 hour bombing missions I used to feel like maybe I was like that and now I realize I'm not
[06:47.680 --> 06:54.640]  and if I drink coffee after five o'clock I'm usually up until five a.m but I'm so I'm not
[06:54.640 --> 07:00.640]  drinking it as we speak I'm drinking Hal's fizzy water but I did have trade coffee here
[07:00.640 --> 07:06.720]  which was ground today through a what is it I always forget the name of the goddamn
[07:06.720 --> 07:16.960]  Baratza Virtuoso which I do it's beloved what is trade trade coffee is a coffee subscription
[07:16.960 --> 07:21.520]  service just like Marco was talking about and they make it simple to discover new coffees
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.720]  and make your best cup of coffee at home every day they don't make all this coffee that I don't
[07:26.720 --> 07:33.680]  think they roast any of it what trade does is partner with the nation's top-rated independent
[07:33.680 --> 07:40.320]  roasters and I mean I dozens maybe hundreds I don't know but certainly dozens I've been
[07:40.320 --> 07:45.360]  subscribed to them pretty much all year and I'm not sure I've gotten coffee from the same roaster
[07:45.360 --> 07:53.440]  twice and they send you the best quality coffee as a subscription service exactly at the pace
[07:53.440 --> 07:58.640]  that you want you want a bag a week you want maybe you're like in an office or you have a
[07:58.640 --> 08:03.920]  family full of coffee drinkers you need multiple bags a week you want it every two weeks you want
[08:03.920 --> 08:10.960]  it every month whatever schedule you want you can set it and whether you already know what you like
[08:10.960 --> 08:17.840]  or if you're new to specialty coffee and need help trade website makes it easy and convenient
[08:17.840 --> 08:24.880]  to discover new coffees they send it fresh to your home on your schedule I love their coffee
[08:24.880 --> 08:29.040]  I stay subscribed to it and I would stay subscribed to it even if they weren't sponsoring
[08:29.040 --> 08:35.600]  the show it is terrific I do it for exactly the reason Margo said before it's variety it
[08:35.600 --> 08:41.760]  tastes different and it's good and I like it so what do you do to do this if you want and again
[08:41.760 --> 08:48.080]  I've mentioned this every time I talk about coffee coffee is produce it is like it does
[08:48.080 --> 08:54.720]  coffee beans don't look like fruit or apples you know apples or oranges or something that goes bad
[08:54.720 --> 09:01.840]  but they really do even though old coffee beans don't really look that different than fresh
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.040]  roasted coffee beans the taste difference is dramatic and the stuff you buy like at a
[09:07.040 --> 09:14.640]  supermarket shelf even from a good brand is way way older than like you wouldn't buy fruit that's
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.040]  just bagged up and is not in a produce section where they're refrigerating it and stuff like
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.280]  that coffee is exactly like that it is among all the other factors of that what makes good coffee
[09:25.840 --> 09:31.520]  different from mediocre or bad coffee freshness is got to be number one and the stuff you get
[09:31.520 --> 09:37.920]  from trade is super duper fresh it is like as soon as it's roasted it's sealed goes into the mail and
[09:37.920 --> 09:44.320]  is ding dong two days later it's at your door three days from Marco because it takes an extra
[09:44.320 --> 09:49.360]  day for everything to get to I'll tell you what though like like the you know the the difference
[09:49.360 --> 09:52.240]  like you know you're just saying like oh the grocery store coffee is much more stale I don't
[09:52.240 --> 09:57.840]  think people will fully appreciate to what degree like so with with trade coffee you're getting it
[09:57.840 --> 10:01.920]  mailed to you and by the time it arrives to you even if even when it arrives to me in my crazy
[10:01.920 --> 10:07.440]  place it's it has been roasted maybe four days ago at most if you look in the grocery store
[10:08.240 --> 10:12.320]  I just did this because I was just last week I was out of town and I wanted to buy a bag of coffee
[10:12.320 --> 10:16.320]  and like it was like a whole food or something and so you know looking at all the fancy brands all
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.960]  this one's local this one's fresh this one's in New Jersey like you know all these like nice local
[10:20.960 --> 10:25.040]  things that that you know roasters that some of which I even knew where their roastery was
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.960]  and I was looking and I you know you turn the bag over and you can usually see there's usually
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.400]  a sticker on any kind of good coffee bag to see like when it was roasted I could not find any
[10:34.400 --> 10:39.920]  that were roasted less than three weeks ago and compare three weeks at the best case was three
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.080]  weeks ago they were many that were much older than that three weeks ago compared to like three or
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.600]  four days ago it's a massive difference well what do you do to get started upgrade your morning
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.760]  routine with better coffee right now trade is offering a free bag of coffee with any subscription
[10:55.760 --> 11:06.880]  at drink trade.com slash the talk show that's drink trade.com slash the talk show for a free
[11:06.880 --> 11:14.400]  bag of coffee with any subscription service drink trade.com slash the talk show I would dare you
[11:14.400 --> 11:20.640]  dare you to you know how like on your show you got like a little banjo that separates the official
[11:20.640 --> 11:27.280]  markers between the sponsorships and the show I would dare you that was actually Merlin-esque
[11:28.320 --> 11:36.560]  in terms of blurring what is the show and what is the sponsor read Merlin with Merlin I I know
[11:36.560 --> 11:40.880]  you listen to my show but I think you'd listen I hope you listen to my show but you know with
[11:40.880 --> 11:46.240]  Merlin I honestly it to me it's like I lose track of the show and the sponsor read just becomes the
[11:46.240 --> 11:54.080]  show us talking about those slippers from Mack Weldon honest to god I mean that was like a 45
[11:54.080 --> 12:02.000]  minute sponsor read the one time um a couple of things I want to talk about a main reason I wanted
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.720]  to have you on this week is I want to talk about the new home pods and I loved your review of them
[12:06.720 --> 12:16.000]  on ATP and more or less just want to steal it and put it on my show but and I've been struggling to
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.680]  write my own but on the news front I wanted to talk first I've been I've actually spent my whole
[12:23.680 --> 12:30.480]  weekend working I haven't written anything about it yet but Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen at the
[12:30.480 --> 12:40.640]  Wall Street Journal published an amazing piece on Friday a story do you saw this right yeah I would
[12:40.640 --> 12:46.520]  call it a bombshell yeah I really and I spent all weekend working on it but the gist of their story
[12:46.520 --> 12:55.440]  in the Wall Street Journal is that they found about a dozen people in New York maybe some of
[12:55.440 --> 13:04.640]  them are outside New York who had their iPhones stolen like Mo almost I think almost all the ones
[13:04.640 --> 13:11.280]  they talked to when they were like out at night socializing at bars or something like that iPhone
[13:11.280 --> 13:17.440]  is stolen and they realize the iPhone stolen and next thing you know they're in addition to being
[13:17.440 --> 13:23.360]  stolen they're locked at the completely locked out of their iCloud account so even if they have like
[13:23.360 --> 13:31.200]  a friend and they can get to a find my iPhone or they can get home and get to like their iPad or a
[13:31.200 --> 13:39.680]  MacBook that they might have that's all those devices are also locked out of iCloud and it's
[13:39.680 --> 13:50.320]  effectively game over that the thief has access to everything on their phone every day and everything
[13:50.320 --> 14:01.440]  in iCloud and they can't get it back or restore it this sounds so horrific that I my first thought
[14:01.440 --> 14:09.040]  when I read it was there's got to be some hole in this story or some the purse these victims did
[14:09.040 --> 14:15.600]  something incredibly foolish or reckless or or something like that but the basic gist of what
[14:15.600 --> 14:24.720]  I just said it is completely true and it with some caveats it in theory could happen to anybody
[14:25.600 --> 14:30.240]  and then Joe in addition to the people they found in New York and and talked to firsthand they
[14:30.240 --> 14:37.520]  talked to a police detective that she got in contact with in Minneapolis who has investigated
[14:37.520 --> 14:46.640]  dozens of these cases maybe more I forgot I was talking with Joanna last night it's not like oh a
[14:46.640 --> 14:55.680]  handful it is like dozens of cases again you said it's it's a blockbuster it seems like the the
[14:55.680 --> 15:00.080]  biggest surprise to this you know because even people you know even people like like us who you
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.760]  know we're like you know apple power users it's our job to kind to know this stuff we think we
[15:03.760 --> 15:08.240]  know it really well the biggest surprise to me which I think surprised most people like us
[15:08.800 --> 15:15.360]  is that so so you know the main method of of the theft here was that the thieves would basically
[15:15.360 --> 15:20.160]  like look over their shoulder and see what their passcode was when they entered it right and then
[15:20.160 --> 15:23.840]  go ahead and steal the phone but the and and soon you know to some degree you can say well
[15:24.400 --> 15:30.240]  that's going to be pretty hard to protect against but the big bombshell for this is that you can
[15:30.240 --> 15:37.680]  re apparently you can reset an apple id password only knowing the passcode to the phone right so
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.360]  what they're doing is they are shoulder surfing the passcode stealing the phone at some point
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.000]  and then quickly going and changing the apple id password and then and being able to then log into
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.400]  the apple id do all the same secure stuff you can do from an apple id or you know remote change
[15:52.400 --> 15:57.760]  devices remote revoke devices and then have full access to your apple account I mean that to me
[15:57.760 --> 16:04.560]  that's the hole right there is no I don't think anyone in our circles knew that you can reset an
[16:04.560 --> 16:10.000]  apple id password by just knowing the passcode to a phone right I I don't think so either all right
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.560]  and I knew that there's a lot that you can do with just the passcode and the one thing that's
[16:14.560 --> 16:22.480]  been on my mind for a while is that with just the passcode it it gives you access to the keychain
[16:22.480 --> 16:30.080]  and or you know it's in on the iphone you go into settings and passwords and anything that's in
[16:30.080 --> 16:37.120]  passwords is visible and you can see all the passwords you can see all the authenticator codes
[16:38.320 --> 16:46.560]  there's no other factors involved just to get into keychain but the truth is so like explain
[16:46.560 --> 16:53.280]  you know again going trying to explain this out the way my mind works is how I always want to
[16:53.280 --> 16:59.120]  know what these stories how exactly does this work because this seems so fantastic so fantastic
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.560]  that it there's got to be some step in here where you're like oh that's the step where it
[17:04.560 --> 17:10.560]  wouldn't affect me because I'm smart and I've turned on blank you know like a smart person does
[17:10.560 --> 17:21.520]  um yeah like go back in time to like the original iphone and passcodes weren't even a thing one of
[17:21.520 --> 17:27.840]  the biggest demos of the original passcode was slide to unlock right because with nobody
[17:27.840 --> 17:34.880]  passcoded their phones right they're pre-iphone you just opened up your phone and started doing
[17:34.880 --> 17:39.280]  stuff and and they're you know maybe there would be like a button you would hold for a couple of
[17:39.280 --> 17:46.320]  seconds to make sure you don't like pocket dial somebody um and I guess some people could put
[17:46.320 --> 17:50.800]  a code on their phone if they had like a secure job or something like that but I don't recall
[17:50.800 --> 17:55.760]  ever putting a code on my phone pre-iphone it was not the norm right most people didn't do it
[17:56.400 --> 18:03.600]  so we went from you know and it so it makes sense that apple designed the original iphone
[18:03.600 --> 18:09.280]  to to fit in that world where it's like a phone and like an ipod where you just take it out of
[18:09.280 --> 18:15.040]  your pocket and do something to make sure you're not pocket dialing or pocket playing songs or
[18:15.040 --> 18:23.120]  whatever else could happen accidentally and slide to unlock was the their solution to it like okay
[18:23.120 --> 18:30.480]  this phone won't do anything yet but here's slide to unlock and it was a in those terms of the
[18:30.480 --> 18:38.320]  pre-ios7 flattening a totally lickable interface like they spent time you know some designer like
[18:38.320 --> 18:46.560]  mike madis spent like full effort and full power of a great graphic designer designing a little
[18:46.560 --> 18:52.080]  button down to the pixels and like a little three-dimensional looking channel for that thing
[18:52.080 --> 19:00.000]  to go across and that got you into the phone and you can do anything right so like if steve jobs
[19:00.000 --> 19:07.840]  had lost his phone in 2007 and you found it you know like there was a picture of him one time at
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.400]  like one of his kids soccer games or something just standing there with an iphone i think i
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.720]  think it was a famous picture because it was before the iphone after it had been announced
[19:16.720 --> 19:22.560]  but before it came out and it's like holy shit there's steve jobs at a soccer high school soccer
[19:22.560 --> 19:30.160]  game with an iphone but if he had like lost it you could have gotten into steve jobs's phone
[19:30.160 --> 19:36.240]  with just sliding your thumb across the screen and then you know we've gone from there to you know
[19:36.880 --> 19:42.720]  here where we've realized you know there's you know people have their entire digital lives
[19:43.440 --> 19:47.680]  on these phones and we've protected them more and apple has developed
[19:47.680 --> 20:00.160]  a face id and touch id as these biometric things to encourage people to have some protection
[20:00.160 --> 20:07.120]  like a big problem apple solved over these years was encouraging people to put codes on their phone
[20:07.120 --> 20:13.760]  at all right like when it first started to become a thing and apple clearly realized oh everybody
[20:13.760 --> 20:17.920]  we should make we should try to encourage everybody to have a phone or a code on their
[20:17.920 --> 20:23.120]  phone there were i knew people who resisted it i'm not going to name names but you know there
[20:23.120 --> 20:31.600]  were people in my household who didn't see the need and they didn't even now like you can still
[20:31.600 --> 20:35.520]  set up a phone without a passcode but and it's funny because i do it on a regular basis because
[20:35.520 --> 20:40.880]  all my like developer phones that are just yeah i need a device that runs ios 15 you know so i
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.960]  have an i have an old iphone that i use for that and i always set those up without passcodes and
[20:44.960 --> 20:49.520]  it's they make it increasingly difficult to like find like the little hidden option to do it and
[20:49.520 --> 20:53.360]  they yell at you a whole bunch like you really shouldn't do this you're like it's you have to
[20:53.360 --> 20:58.800]  try pretty hard it's almost like an anti-dark pattern it's like a light pattern of yes of bad
[20:58.800 --> 21:07.120]  user interface or or not not bad user interface but um obtuse user interface where this should
[21:07.120 --> 21:13.840]  be obtuse and discouraging right and we typically think of those techniques of being ways to like
[21:15.200 --> 21:20.960]  make it hard to unsubscribe from a service you've already subscribed to and they were a real jerk
[21:20.960 --> 21:27.520]  about it and they uh or or you know just to think about the way that the dark pattern you i run into
[21:28.240 --> 21:35.200]  every single day is you get a marketing email from somebody and the unsubscribe link is in
[21:35.200 --> 21:43.600]  six point type and it's set to 40 gray at the bottom of the email right it's like i don't know
[21:43.600 --> 21:50.400]  that the i don't know that the email clients would render typeset at a smaller css point size
[21:50.400 --> 21:56.240]  and it's you know gray gray text on a white background they definitely do that to discourage
[21:56.240 --> 22:03.600]  people from trying to set up a phone without a passcode it was famous back when trump was
[22:03.600 --> 22:10.800]  president he had he had conway kanye west in in his office for some you know of course nonsensical
[22:11.440 --> 22:17.760]  meeting and clown show and with you know with cameras and press and people and kanye
[22:17.760 --> 22:22.320]  had his phone and wanted to show something and his passcode was one one one one
[22:23.760 --> 22:29.120]  and it was completely visible hold that thought but completely visible to the world and there
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.520]  i think it was one it was either one one one one or one two three four i'm pretty sure though it was
[22:33.520 --> 22:39.600]  one one one one um it's that's probably the most common passcode like if you had if you actually
[22:39.600 --> 22:43.680]  had the numbers like how well you know what are the most common passcodes i bet one one one is
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.080]  by far the most i don't know that it's so i haven't done it in a while but i've while doing things
[22:48.080 --> 22:53.680]  like setting testing review phones um i've set up phones and tried to make it stupid easy like
[22:53.680 --> 22:58.640]  here's a review phone that i'm not actually going to put a sim card in i just i'm just gonna play
[22:58.640 --> 23:03.520]  around with it in my house so i'm not even going to leave the house with it and if you try that it
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.040]  actually will tell you i think at least the last time i tried it with certain of those passcodes
[23:09.600 --> 23:16.400]  this the ios will tell you that that's a that's a weak passcode maybe do you want to maybe try
[23:16.400 --> 23:21.760]  something that's not easily guessed you know you're going to try literally anything else
[23:21.760 --> 23:30.240]  besides one one one one so we're in a world now where everybody has these passcodes but
[23:31.200 --> 23:38.960]  the thing that's not obvious really not really that it's just it's sort of mind-blowing to me
[23:38.960 --> 23:43.760]  and to you to probably everybody who's listening and i suspect a lot of people who are listening
[23:43.760 --> 23:51.040]  who didn't spend their entire weekend researching this are still listening to us thinking it can't
[23:51.040 --> 23:57.120]  be this bad it can't be there you know i can't be this exposed if somebody knows my passcode
[23:57.120 --> 24:06.720]  but the truth is if you have the phone and you know the passcode you're in god mode you have
[24:06.720 --> 24:12.560]  access to anything and everything on the phone there is nothing on the phone that you can't
[24:13.360 --> 24:19.680]  do or change nothing there's every single thing on the phone now you might use
[24:19.680 --> 24:29.840]  an app a third-party app like a bank app or like a password manager or even a notes app i just
[24:29.840 --> 24:36.720]  i remember getting the feature requests from vesper users you know where a notes app sometimes will
[24:36.720 --> 24:42.800]  let you set your own password within the app and that has nothing to do with your key it
[24:42.800 --> 24:48.960]  doesn't go in your keychain and so something like that you still would be protected from
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.280]  um no you wouldn't see i was just thinking about this because like one of the security things that
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.640]  i do is i don't store my main banking password in a password manager right i don't store it anywhere
[25:00.640 --> 25:05.440]  i just know it and it's a it's a very secure password and it never goes in a password manager
[25:05.440 --> 25:08.080]  because i figure that's you know of all the important passwords i have that's probably
[25:08.080 --> 25:13.040]  the most important uh and so i was just thinking like oh well at least i'm protected there but no
[25:13.040 --> 25:21.680]  i'm not because i've set up face id for that app for convenience and face and so face id
[25:21.680 --> 25:27.520]  that's the passcode right so if if you had my phone and the passcode i realized like five
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.040]  minutes ago i think about this oh my god wait a minute that's i'm exposed there because if you
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.840]  have my phone and you should reserve my passcode and you get my phone then you could log into my
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.480]  bank app right because i have a face id log in there and anything like that anything where you
[25:40.480 --> 25:46.560]  have face id or touch id protection that is only as good as your passcode and if your passcode is
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.640]  known to somebody and then they gain physical access to the device they can get into anything
[25:50.640 --> 25:55.040]  protected by face id including not only you know any apps that have it but also as you mentioned
[25:55.040 --> 25:59.840]  earlier all of your saved passwords and apple's password thing uh or if you use a password manager
[25:59.840 --> 26:05.200]  like one password and you have face id for that there you go that's that's also then exposed right
[26:05.200 --> 26:09.360]  so you're only anything the only thing that wouldn't be protected would be something that
[26:09.360 --> 26:18.000]  is protected by a third party separate password and you don't have face id or touch id enabled to
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.240]  get into that i'm going to just say face id because i think that's what everybody most
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.280]  mostly everybody's on now i'll get to there's some specific differences with touch id on some
[26:27.280 --> 26:33.760]  of the implications of this um but i'm i i for brevity i'll i'll just say face id um
[26:33.760 --> 26:40.240]  face id the the other thing i've learned over the weekend and i guess i knew this but now i know it
[26:40.800 --> 26:51.120]  is that face id is only an accelerant for your passcode it's not two things like
[26:52.240 --> 27:00.000]  two like a left hand and a right hand it's it is the only thing that protects your phone
[27:00.000 --> 27:09.600]  is your passcode and face id is a layer above the passcode that gets you into the passcode
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.960]  they're not two equal methods of getting it and therefore every time anything that you do with
[27:16.960 --> 27:25.440]  face id and i i learned this daily during covid while i was out wearing a face mask in public and
[27:25.440 --> 27:33.680]  while i was out wearing a face mask in public and at the most 90 of that time before apple had
[27:34.480 --> 27:41.040]  enabled face id to work with a mask on uh where i'd bring my phone up and the face id fails and
[27:41.040 --> 27:47.680]  then immediately gives you the passcode opt entry as an option everything anytime you ever are
[27:47.680 --> 27:56.720]  prompted for face id if it doesn't work you have the option to use your passcode instead and that's
[27:56.720 --> 28:04.080]  because those biometric methods are just accelerant for the passcode so if you have the phone and you
[28:04.080 --> 28:12.560]  have the passcode you're in god mode on the phone everything is possible the one the other thing
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.400]  that to me i just didn't know i really didn't is what you mentioned before and this is all
[28:19.920 --> 28:25.600]  the level that takes you out of god mode just on the phone and lets you take over the account is
[28:25.600 --> 28:35.120]  you go to settings icloud which is that thing at the top with your picture right and your name
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.440]  yeah the terrible ui where you never think to look there at first because it doesn't even look
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.640]  like a button necessarily right so you're you're at the very top of settings it has your name
[28:44.640 --> 28:50.400]  and it says apple id icloud medium purchases second level down is password and security
[28:52.000 --> 28:58.080]  and or i think that's where this is is that where is this or no you have to go down to where do
[28:58.080 --> 29:02.320]  where do you do it i've i just did it three times over the weekend but i can't figure out where
[29:02.320 --> 29:05.760]  exactly where it is now but anyway there's somewhere on the somewhere it's in there
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.240]  uh
[29:10.640 --> 29:14.400]  you go down there and it says password and you can go reset
[29:15.600 --> 29:23.440]  password and then you just enter a new password and re-enter it to confirm it's the same one
[29:23.440 --> 29:31.680]  and boom you've changed the icloud password without ever entering or being prompted for
[29:31.680 --> 29:39.440]  the old password right and the surprise thing to me about that is that i i just i don't think
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.760]  i've ever done it that way because i don't i don't know i've probably only changed my icloud
[29:43.760 --> 29:50.080]  password a handful of times in i don't know 20 years right i mean i've been using it since it
[29:50.080 --> 29:55.840]  was mac.com um yeah and if i wanted to change my icloud password i would do it on the website like
[29:55.840 --> 29:59.520]  from a computer right like i would never i would never think to do it i mean of course you can do
[29:59.520 --> 30:03.280]  it on the phone that makes sense but i would never have thought to do that like so i would never even
[30:03.280 --> 30:10.080]  have to look for this feature uh oh here it is it's right at the top so you go to i at the top
[30:10.080 --> 30:16.480]  of settings into icloud second level down is password and security and the very the very first
[30:16.480 --> 30:23.200]  item at the top is in it's blue even it's it's even more prominent you just hit change password
[30:23.200 --> 30:31.840]  and it it spins for a little and as with everything icloud but then all you have to do it does it
[30:31.840 --> 30:37.760]  doesn't just let you change it what it asks you for is your iphone passcode and you type your
[30:37.760 --> 30:44.240]  iphone passcode which is the two the only two factors the thief needs physical possession of
[30:44.240 --> 30:50.640]  the device and knowledge of the passcode you enter it here i am entering it and
[30:50.640 --> 30:59.760]  and boom i have a field where i can change my icloud password uh without knowing the old one
[30:59.760 --> 31:05.040]  right without knowing the old one and the second you complete that
[31:07.200 --> 31:14.480]  the second you've entered a new icloud password the very next thing the iphone does is prompt you
[31:14.480 --> 31:20.800]  do you want to lock out all the other devices that are currently logged into this icloud account
[31:22.480 --> 31:31.920]  and you oh god and use two options like decline or you know accept and or or you know lock them out
[31:31.920 --> 31:40.640]  and you hit lock them out and then boom the other devices are locked out and then that's it game
[31:40.640 --> 31:47.520]  over for the victim and there's there's no way for them to get back certainly can't get back
[31:47.520 --> 31:55.280]  the iphone uh can't control that the person who has the iphone has access to everything on your
[31:55.280 --> 32:00.960]  iphone but they can't get back their icloud account there's nothing they can do nothing
[32:00.960 --> 32:12.480]  apple can do and you could say oh but i set up uh the uh uh recovery key and i have it i know i
[32:12.480 --> 32:18.720]  know i have that stored safely i printed it out and put it in a safe place in my house it's too
[32:18.720 --> 32:26.000]  late the recovery key is only for i i tried this over the weekend there's no way to get to any
[32:26.000 --> 32:31.600]  area where you can just use this recovery key oh that's interesting so if you you can't go to like
[32:31.600 --> 32:37.040]  a forgot password thing you know you can go to the forgot password thing but there's no path
[32:37.040 --> 32:45.440]  at that point to to use the recovery key to get your account back same thing for a recovery
[32:46.000 --> 32:52.960]  contact like if i say i trust marco so much that i'm going to make marco arm at my recovery contact
[32:52.960 --> 33:01.200]  and i vacationing in hawaii and while i'm taking a picture of a volcano drop my iphone right into a
[33:01.200 --> 33:12.960]  volcano and it just melts and now i don't have an iphone and i've forgotten my my i've also
[33:12.960 --> 33:21.600]  forgotten my icloud account password so i can't even get into icloud there you can get back to
[33:21.600 --> 33:29.600]  there you could help me because what i could do is go back to i could go to verizon tell them what
[33:29.600 --> 33:35.680]  happened and i can prove that i'm still me and i'll get a new phone and now i've got my phone
[33:35.680 --> 33:43.360]  number again and i can go to i i forgot apple.com and there's a path you i don't i won't go through
[33:43.360 --> 33:49.120]  all the db it's not easy you know it's not supposed to be obvious but i go there but they'll
[33:49.120 --> 33:54.080]  say at some point and and they'll say you know well what you you don't know your password huh
[33:54.080 --> 34:01.280]  well how about we'll send a code to your trusted phone number and then i get the trusted phone
[34:01.280 --> 34:11.040]  number and that lets me into my my icloud account but i won't have access to any of my encrypted
[34:11.040 --> 34:19.200]  stuff so i won't have access to my keychain i won't have access to my health data they've start
[34:19.200 --> 34:25.920]  right am i right they've started encrypting your photo library now right um is is it that way by
[34:25.920 --> 34:30.560]  default or do you have to opt into the the whole encryption thing i can't believe i forgot about
[34:30.560 --> 34:35.120]  this because i've written about it so much but you don't get access to any of your encrypted stuff
[34:35.120 --> 34:45.040]  if you yeah keychain yeah um uh but what i can do to get access to that uh encrypted stuff
[34:45.760 --> 34:53.120]  and then get full access is i can i can say i have recovery contact or i have that recovery key the
[34:53.120 --> 35:06.000]  28 digit and number mixed character thing and i can use that to as a key to decrypt to give you
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.840]  know i can give that to apple digitally type it in and then that will decrypt my encrypted stuff
[35:11.840 --> 35:18.960]  that they have in icloud and now i'm back to having a full thing but you can't do that if
[35:18.960 --> 35:28.240]  you don't have the phone number um there might be i i'm not quite sure maybe there's a path here
[35:28.240 --> 35:33.920]  where the thief you can go to verizon and prove that somebody stole your phone and you could still
[35:33.920 --> 35:42.800]  get your phone number back even though um you know even though the thief still has your phone
[35:42.800 --> 35:47.280]  right it's i think that you know oh yeah that i mean that's the whole thing with like you know
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.920]  sim card cloning attacks is you go to a carrier store and you say oh sorry i lost my phone give
[35:51.920 --> 35:57.760]  me a new you know you know clone my sim onto this new phone i'm buying and and that's that's why
[35:57.760 --> 36:05.520]  like two-factor stuff to a phone number is not super secure um but it's call i i so i'm not
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.200]  quite sure so i'm not quite sure why some of the victims that joanna and and nicole talked to still
[36:11.200 --> 36:16.640]  are locked out of their icloud account it might be that i'm i'm not 100 sure on some of these details
[36:16.640 --> 36:20.560]  yeah that's why like i said i've been working on it all weekend so it might be that that gets you
[36:22.080 --> 36:28.080]  it might be that that still doesn't help you because the thief changed the password it's
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.880]  it's still you still might be screwed i think that that's the problem yeah i'm right that's the
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.560]  problem the problem is in my scenario where i drop my phone in a volcano my icloud password hasn't
[36:38.560 --> 36:44.800]  been changed and so your recovery key that yes my trust that says this is right you still are you're
[36:44.800 --> 36:51.520]  fucked if even if verizon gives you your phone number back because in the in the innocent
[36:51.520 --> 36:59.120]  scenario where the phone was destroyed or lost off a bridge or whatever the the icloud password
[36:59.120 --> 37:05.360]  is still there you just forgot it in your head and so your recovery key will still decrypt my stuff
[37:05.360 --> 37:11.920]  or or the recovery key that i've printed out the 28-digit thing will still work but in the case
[37:11.920 --> 37:17.280]  where the thief has changed the password that invalidates all of those previous things oh and
[37:17.280 --> 37:24.240]  the other thing you can do once you're in the phone with this is this is the other thing once
[37:24.240 --> 37:29.360]  this is where it is i should back up i've just forgotten it there's so many little details here
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.840]  this is why i've been working on it all weekend this is the thing because you got access to
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.960]  everything on the phone the checklist of things that a thief and one of these rings will do
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.920]  is immediately go in and when after they've changed their password they'll go down and
[37:43.920 --> 37:49.680]  just delete the recovery keys because you can always you can always revoke a recovery key and
[37:49.680 --> 37:58.880]  you can always revoke a recovery contact right so you know if you and i break up as friends
[37:58.880 --> 38:04.720]  and i no longer trust you then i you know of course i can remove you as my recovery key
[38:04.720 --> 38:11.680]  right or contact right if you get a divorce you of course you can change your recovery contact
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.240]  so it's no longer the spouse who you've broken up with right of course and so it's you know
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.520]  there's like a checklist of like seven things that that a thief in one of these rings would do and
[38:23.520 --> 38:31.040]  one of them would be revoking those recovery keys which all you need to do is know the passcode
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.800]  this is all because if if you have a phone with a passcode and then you have control of the apple
[38:36.800 --> 38:41.520]  id from that the phone is also a two-factor device so you have any two-factor code from
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.840]  apple like it's it just you have everything at that point if you have if you have the apple id
[38:46.480 --> 38:50.240]  and a logged in phone you're that's it that's everything yep that's everything
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.840]  and this is all by design this is not an oversight or a bug right like remember
[38:57.840 --> 39:03.920]  back in the early days i mean like early years because it would every couple i don't know once
[39:03.920 --> 39:08.720]  a year or so one of these glitches would come up remember there'd be like these lock screen hijacks
[39:08.720 --> 39:16.800]  where it would be just some kind of weird bug in in ios where if you entered the numbers fat super
[39:16.800 --> 39:23.040]  fast you could like somehow get through even if it wasn't the right number or if you met did just
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.880]  yeah some sequence of events you could like yeah like you know operate some part of the phone that
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.680]  was supposed to be locked right without unlocking it right or it was like if you did it right when
[39:31.680 --> 39:40.640]  a notification first arrived you could get through without it or um is the head you know something
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.560]  that you would do like there's always been a handful of things you could do with a locked
[39:44.560 --> 39:52.320]  phone like the way that you can take pictures without unlocking it um and you'd go into that
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.600]  mode and swipe up swipe down and then all of a sudden you're in and they've you know they seem
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.880]  to have closed most of those bugs this this whole scenario we're talking about is not some kind of
[40:02.880 --> 40:14.560]  oversight it is something that apple designed to work this way and this is simply a known danger
[40:14.560 --> 40:23.280]  danger in the design and the might say well what why in the world would they design it this way
[40:23.280 --> 40:35.920]  and the reason is there are vastly more people who forget their iCloud password
[40:37.200 --> 40:42.080]  but of course still know their phone passcode because they have to you know almost nobody
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.360]  forgets that so they know how to get in their phone they don't know their iCloud password
[40:47.360 --> 40:54.960]  and there are vastly more of these people and being able to change it this way is uh
[40:56.080 --> 41:05.200]  is by design and knowing though so there's like let's say hundreds of people I don't know a year
[41:05.200 --> 41:12.880]  hundreds or thousands of people who get their phone stolen and are lose everything this way
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.840]  to a thief and tens of thousands of people or more I don't know if it's orders of magnitude or what
[41:19.840 --> 41:29.120]  but what I have been told by people who would know it is vastly more people are saved and regain
[41:29.120 --> 41:36.720]  access to their iCloud account than who are victims of thieves through this which is why
[41:36.720 --> 41:45.280]  it's designed this way and it is the true and it is the case that with an android phone you can do
[41:45.280 --> 41:54.080]  the same thing you can reset your main google account password knowing nothing but the passcode
[41:54.080 --> 41:59.760]  to the android phone I mean that's the hard part right like you know when you're designing these
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.560]  things especially for the mass market and especially for something as important to
[42:02.560 --> 42:08.640]  someone's phone you know there's there's huge trade-offs with security that you have to account
[42:08.640 --> 42:14.560]  for the humans being forgetful and making mistakes and it's this is always such a hard balance and
[42:14.560 --> 42:20.000]  security design and you know I don't I don't envy Apple's position here and I'm I'm not looking at
[42:20.000 --> 42:26.080]  this saying like oh what what idiots they were instead it's it's more like oh wow I did not know
[42:26.080 --> 42:30.160]  this hole was there and it makes sense if you think about it if you make it makes sense why
[42:30.160 --> 42:33.920]  it's there as you were just saying because lots of people forget their passwords and passcodes all
[42:33.920 --> 42:39.440]  the time and and they are more likely to forget the apple id password than they are to forget the
[42:39.440 --> 42:44.160]  passcode of the phone they're typing in three times a day um but I you know the big shock here
[42:44.160 --> 42:48.800]  is like you know during during code as you mentioned earlier like when we were all first
[42:48.800 --> 42:54.080]  having a grocery shopping you know all masked up and everything before apple had face id recognizing
[42:54.080 --> 42:59.680]  masks which really came fairly late in that process we were all having to type in our
[42:59.680 --> 43:04.800]  passcodes all the time and before that I had switched to an alphanumeric passcode like a
[43:04.800 --> 43:11.520]  password and and when that happened I was having to type it in so much oftentimes like wearing
[43:11.520 --> 43:17.120]  plastic gloves in the grocery store and everything it was such a pain that I would I I had switched
[43:17.120 --> 43:23.200]  you know pretty early in code but I switched back to a numeric passcode and I had kept that
[43:23.200 --> 43:28.800]  numeric passcode until today when I when I saw when I you know heard about this story I'm like
[43:28.800 --> 43:34.640]  oh my god wait a minute because if you can reset the apple id password by knowing the phone passcode
[43:34.640 --> 43:40.160]  then effectively my apple id password was just a six digit number like and and that's not like
[43:40.160 --> 43:44.000]  that's not the level of security that I want for that or that I think is warranted for that and so
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.400]  you know apple has all these requirements the apple id password has to have certain characteristics
[43:48.400 --> 43:51.760]  has to be a certain minimum length has to have you know letters numbers whatever you know whatever
[43:51.760 --> 43:56.320]  the requirements are because that's a really high security password that means that that the
[43:56.320 --> 44:01.760]  apple id means a lot it's a it's a huge risk surface right but if you can have a phone with
[44:01.760 --> 44:07.600]  a few numbers on it that might be one one one one and you can then take the apple id from that well
[44:07.600 --> 44:11.280]  then that's effectively the apple id's password levels or password security level rather and so
[44:11.280 --> 44:19.920]  it what this you know like many security loopholes or or bugs or tricks you learn oh you know you
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.560]  have this big you know wall of security over here your apple id password it's really secure
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.640]  but you didn't realize that there you could just walk around the wall in this way and have
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.480]  a much lower security version of something get right around that so i i think it's wise for
[44:34.480 --> 44:40.640]  nerds like us to to treat your phone passcode the same way you'd treat your apple id password in
[44:40.640 --> 44:45.680]  terms of security because they are effectively you know one leads to the other yeah so i looked
[44:45.680 --> 44:51.520]  it up just for people who are going to email me i've done it so it was just a few months ago which
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.200]  is why i'm surprised i forgot it already where apple announced advanced data protection for
[44:57.200 --> 45:04.160]  icloud end-to-end encryption for backups photos and more so if you have that turned on that that's
[45:04.160 --> 45:12.880]  included in the stuff that you lose access to in the case where you would need like a recovery key
[45:12.880 --> 45:23.120]  or recovery contact so photos are included all of this is um i have a alphanumeric password on my
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.680]  phone and i have for a while i did the same thing during covid during the mask there was just no way
[45:27.680 --> 45:35.520]  i was going to type that in all the time not out of paranoia but because it's very this is a very
[45:36.560 --> 45:43.600]  very personal look into my psyche and my chronic procrastination is i've been
[45:44.880 --> 45:50.880]  meaning to write for probably over a year a a daring fireball piece
[45:50.880 --> 45:58.480]  declaring that a six-digit passcode is actually more than secure enough for an iphone
[45:59.360 --> 46:07.040]  even though you might not intuitively think it is thinking only about like crackers somebody who
[46:07.040 --> 46:12.880]  just has the phone and is using like one of those black market devices that can enter passcodes
[46:12.880 --> 46:22.240]  you know very quickly because once you enter pass enough passcodes incorrectly the phone gets locked
[46:22.240 --> 46:32.000]  you can't try them that often and even if you somehow break the phone with a jailbreak and get
[46:32.000 --> 46:43.840]  past that circumvention the ios level of preventing more than 10 attempts the way that the secure
[46:43.840 --> 46:52.400]  enclave works fundamentally not in software but cryptographically is that yeah i think there's
[46:52.400 --> 46:58.640]  like a theoretical limit of only six attempts per second or something i forget i did the piece i
[46:58.640 --> 47:04.320]  want to write would explain it and it would all make sense but the gist of it is that for somebody
[47:04.320 --> 47:13.600]  who falls into some trap and and somebody with complicated apparatus some kind of device and a
[47:13.600 --> 47:19.040]  jailbreak that apple doesn't know about and hasn't closed to get past ios and has access to your
[47:19.040 --> 47:25.440]  secure enclave i mean obviously at this point almost how many people would anybody target like
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.720]  would anybody target like this but let's say you're one of them they still a six-digit
[47:30.720 --> 47:37.920]  passcode would take like on average i don't know like 50 000 years or a million years some
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.560]  unbelievably safe number yeah at from that perspective of an attacker a six-digit passcode
[47:44.560 --> 47:51.520]  is really actually pretty secure uh well that assumes that you have like you know six random
[47:51.520 --> 47:56.640]  rights to which most people don't like you know like if you're making something like people often
[47:56.640 --> 48:03.360]  will overestimate the security value of certain length strings or numbers whatever because they
[48:03.360 --> 48:10.800]  assume that somebody who's trying to brute force it would just try you know a a a a a a b a a c and
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.080]  like and that's not how they do it they they you know use databases of most common values that
[48:16.080 --> 48:21.920]  people actually use and they try the most common ones first and so oftentimes you have way less
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.920]  entropy than you think you do if you've chosen something that's that's you know beyond just
[48:25.920 --> 48:34.080]  pure randomness um so what here's the look into my psyche my my thing to myself was about a year
[48:34.080 --> 48:40.000]  ago or sometime at right after the mask thing was over so it's probably been more than a year
[48:40.000 --> 48:47.040]  but i changed back to this alphanumeric passcode then i decided i looked into this and did the math
[48:47.040 --> 48:53.760]  and and proved the math and thought ah a six-digit passcode is safe enough for me and i'm going to
[48:53.760 --> 48:58.480]  encourage my readers to six that it's safe enough for them but i'm not going to change it on my
[48:58.480 --> 49:05.840]  phone until i write that article it's like that's the carrot to prompt me to do it and obviously i
[49:05.840 --> 49:15.680]  haven't written that article and so i've been using the harder to type alphanumeric uh password
[49:15.680 --> 49:23.040]  to get into the phone ever since and now we're here talking about this story and i'm like huh
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.520]  i've been feeling bad about this every single time i type my password to get into my phone every
[49:29.520 --> 49:37.280]  single time i do it every time every time i restart it every time i uh you know you don't
[49:37.280 --> 49:42.160]  have to enter it that often when you use face id but every time i do every single time i think
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.560]  god damn it i should freaking write that article so i because i don't want to stop doing this i
[49:46.560 --> 49:54.400]  want to go to a much easier to type and you know thumbable passcode and now this story's come out
[49:54.400 --> 50:00.960]  i'm like huh i'm kind of glad i never encouraged people to switch to a passcode if they already had
[50:00.960 --> 50:07.680]  a password alphanumeric password because i don't think i i don't think that's a good idea i really
[50:07.680 --> 50:19.680]  don't um i i don't know i mean it seems like you agree since you changed right yeah because
[50:19.680 --> 50:26.560]  because you know i think in addition to the you know probably better security in in most ways for
[50:26.560 --> 50:31.840]  most people um for it being you know a password style for an alphanumeric password style i think
[50:31.840 --> 50:35.760]  it actually helps this particular problem of somebody like shoulder surfing your code
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.960]  it helps if your code looks and works like typing in a password because you know people i think
[50:43.920 --> 50:48.000]  people don't necessarily think when you're typing your passcode in public
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.600]  if anyone's looking at them right you know if you're just typing in the numbers you know one
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.920]  two three four you know you're used to having it so fast and the buttons are so big and the
[50:55.920 --> 51:01.280]  screen is visible from all angles right like kanye west typed his one one one one in the
[51:01.280 --> 51:10.160]  oval office surrounded by cameras right so i feel like you know the people people will oftentimes
[51:10.160 --> 51:16.480]  uh kind of more casually hit the buttons for the numeric passcodes and not think too much about
[51:16.480 --> 51:21.360]  who can see this you know whereas when you're typing in a password field for the alphanumeric
[51:21.360 --> 51:26.960]  one not only is it just physically smaller and you know a little bit harder for someone to see
[51:26.960 --> 51:32.800]  what you're typing um but also i feel like you might you might just psychologically treat that
[51:32.800 --> 51:37.840]  like a password in the sense that you know you wouldn't if somebody was like looking over your
[51:37.840 --> 51:41.520]  shoulder at your keyboard as you're typing you're not going to type in your password you're gonna
[51:41.520 --> 51:45.760]  be like uh excuse me you know you're gonna like move so your back is to them or whatever and i
[51:45.760 --> 51:52.640]  feel like if you make your phone passcode look and and work like a password entry the way the
[51:52.640 --> 51:59.200]  alphanumeric ones do i think you will just kind of automatically behaviorally have better physical
[51:59.200 --> 52:03.120]  security around yourself you might like turn your back to somebody or you know like you know hold
[52:03.120 --> 52:06.720]  it closer to your chest or no one can see it or whatever like like you you might just kind of
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.560]  instinctively treat it like the password that it is yeah i i don't think that people i i still think
[52:12.560 --> 52:19.280]  you could be safe with a numeric passcode i really do and i'm still thinking maybe after doing talking
[52:19.280 --> 52:24.960]  about all this i still might switch the thing that i think everybody that the number one takeaway
[52:24.960 --> 52:30.400]  to skip to the end that i think everybody should take from this is that you should be
[52:32.880 --> 52:39.200]  and you just touched on it you should be overly paranoid every time you enter your iphone pass
[52:39.200 --> 52:46.960]  code or password in public anytime you do it you should treat it as a secret and be a little creepy
[52:46.960 --> 52:54.800]  about it you know or reverse creepy about it i remember i'm old enough that i remember when atms
[52:54.800 --> 53:03.360]  were a new invention or at least newly universal i was like in elementary school and all of a
[53:03.360 --> 53:09.280]  sudden atms became a thing and you could just if you need you know your dad needed money at the
[53:09.280 --> 53:13.920]  at the mall there was like a machine over there and he'd added a thing that looked like a credit
[53:13.920 --> 53:21.200]  card that went in and then type a number and when i first got a bank account in high like a savings
[53:21.200 --> 53:27.840]  account in high school before i went to college you know they were new and i they were actually
[53:27.840 --> 53:32.480]  better machines because they had like clicky buttons you know it's like my clicky keyboard
[53:32.480 --> 53:38.400]  thing they had really they always they had really good buttons back then but everybody it's just
[53:38.400 --> 53:46.080]  instinctively back in the 80s and 90 or just more of a 90s thing when i was actually using it but
[53:46.080 --> 53:51.360]  i remember them in the 80s but it was like a cultural thing and i remember and amy amy and i
[53:51.360 --> 53:55.280]  were talking about it this weekend as i was obsessed with this story when people entered
[53:55.280 --> 54:03.280]  their atms the codes back then they would really they'd physically hunch over the machine and
[54:03.280 --> 54:09.360]  really really sort of obscure what they were typing i mean as as best you can physically
[54:09.360 --> 54:17.040]  and it was also a cultural norm then if you were next in line for the atm to stand like six feet
[54:17.040 --> 54:24.560]  away like covet distance really but it was a total social thing where if you were closer than about
[54:24.560 --> 54:31.920]  six or seven feet as the next customer it seemed like you were weird and you know it was it was
[54:31.920 --> 54:37.840]  just it you know complete strangers but you know the person who was up would like look over their
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.400]  shoulder and the person would be like oh sorry sorry and take like a couple steps back like they
[54:42.400 --> 54:46.640]  you know it was always like oh you know somebody who was just like i wasn't really thinking sorry
[54:46.640 --> 54:52.480]  sorry and they'd back up and everybody treated those numbers super secretly because this whole
[54:52.480 --> 54:58.880]  idea of getting your cash out of a machine having nothing but a credit card and a four-digit number
[54:59.440 --> 55:06.480]  seemed so weird you know even though and again like all sorts of things you know like like
[55:06.480 --> 55:12.160]  you know people freak out when they buy anything financial happens new i remember i mean remember
[55:12.160 --> 55:17.040]  when buying stuff over the web was like some people thought it's crazy they're like you're
[55:17.040 --> 55:22.320]  nuts you're typing your credit card into a web page you're insane meanwhile they go out to lunch
[55:22.320 --> 55:27.360]  and hand the credit card to the waiter you know when the bill comes yeah and he walks away with it
[55:28.640 --> 55:36.000]  but something novel is naturally it triggers something in the human brain and when atms were
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.800]  novel people treated it like that that's the mentality i think though that everybody should
[55:40.800 --> 55:47.920]  internalize permanently for their passcode for their phone treat it like we did back then don't
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.640]  enter it within six or seven feet of anybody if you get a lot you know somehow you need to enter
[55:52.640 --> 56:00.480]  it in public because you know like i don't it whatever reason you know or or go to the bathroom
[56:00.480 --> 56:05.680]  if you're at a bar if somehow like you're you're you're at a bar and you had your phone sitting on
[56:05.680 --> 56:11.440]  the bar because i think one of the tricks i'm trying i i spent the weekend thinking about this
[56:11.440 --> 56:18.160]  is how did the how do you get someone to have to enter their passcode when in a normal night out
[56:18.160 --> 56:25.040]  you just you'd never need more than face id it's it's unusual but it's like a it's a classic social
[56:25.040 --> 56:30.960]  engineering thing where the scammers would do things and joanna even had a reference to the
[56:30.960 --> 56:37.520]  one guy where one of the tricks was to try to you know get get the victims to let let the perpetrator
[56:37.520 --> 56:43.600]  take a picture of them right so like you meet a couple of women who are out celebrating and and
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.400]  you you know you're there and you're the criminal and you're talking them up and it's cheerful and
[56:48.400 --> 56:52.240]  everybody's having a good time and you find out that they're you know it's one of the one of the
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.400]  women's birthday and you're like let me take a picture of the three of you for the night here
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.760]  give me your phone i'll take a picture of you and you can the guy your phone and it's locked right
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.240]  it's you haven't unlocked the phone you can just hand him the phone that's why the camera is there
[57:06.880 --> 57:13.040]  and he can hit the camera button and take the picture take a couple pictures and then as he
[57:13.040 --> 57:20.160]  hands it back all he has to do is squeeze the two side buttons for two or three seconds and it puts
[57:20.160 --> 57:25.760]  it into the hard lock mode i've written about this hard lock mode all the time where you squeeze
[57:25.760 --> 57:29.840]  the power button and either of the volume buttons for here let me do it to myself
[57:31.600 --> 57:38.880]  ah it let it takes like two seconds maybe two maybe less than two seconds it's the easily less
[57:38.880 --> 57:45.280]  time than it takes to hand the phone back and your hand positions on the phone don't look unusual
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.400]  right it look it's exactly how you'd be holding the phone as you politely hand it back to the
[57:50.400 --> 57:56.560]  person and they hand it back and now it's on this slide to power off and you can or you can it maybe
[57:56.560 --> 58:00.640]  you hit cancel if you're clever so they don't yeah you just hit the hit the sleep wake button again
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.640]  i think then i think it you know it'll it'll dismiss that screen but it's still then right
[58:04.640 --> 58:10.800]  and then all of a sudden and that's a powerfully great feature of the of the iphone and everybody
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.680]  should know that feature like every i always recommend every time you go through tsa or
[58:15.680 --> 58:21.840]  anytime you go through customs anytime you deal with any any kind of law enforcement just squeeze
[58:21.840 --> 58:26.400]  those buttons for a second or two you get a little bit of haptic feedback when you know that it's
[58:26.400 --> 58:30.560]  kicked in you don't have to look at the screen you could do it when it's in your pocket or your purse
[58:31.520 --> 58:38.400]  but at that point the phone needs the passcode to do anything and then then you know then you
[58:38.400 --> 58:43.600]  just that's when you shoulder surf and the next time the person you're trying to steal the phone
[58:43.600 --> 58:49.360]  from unlocks their phone or wants to it's like huh i have to enter my passcode huh there it is
[58:49.360 --> 58:56.160]  passcode see uh joanna's story said that some of them worked in pairs they were the the the group
[58:56.160 --> 59:03.360]  in minnesota was a group of 12 so you could imagine it might be easier to have the person
[59:03.360 --> 59:11.040]  who took the photo on one side hand the phone back have the shoulder surfer on the other side
[59:11.040 --> 59:18.480]  and say like hey look at the photos you know what do you think did i get it right and oh i have to
[59:18.480 --> 59:23.040]  unlock my phone first before i can even see this photo i'll unlock it and the shoulder surfers
[59:23.040 --> 59:31.200]  right there um yep oh man i i think that scenario the let me have your phone to take a picture
[59:31.200 --> 59:37.360]  and then squeeze the buttons as they hand it and then the shoulder surfer is right there is
[59:37.360 --> 59:42.880]  probably the the most common way of doing it i you know there might be other scenarios but
[59:42.880 --> 59:49.600]  i think they all rely on similar things um another and like i said people like sometimes
[59:49.600 --> 59:54.560]  leave their phones on the bar or on a tabletop you know when you're at like a you know sitting
[59:54.560 --> 01:00:01.600]  at a four top um and if all you have to do you don't have to take the phone and people put their
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.080]  phones face down all you have to do if you can surreptitiously just get your hand on those
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:10.720]  buttons and squeeze them for like a second and a half the phone suddenly locked and then the next
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.760]  time that person picks up the phone that's when you're looking to see if you can glean the number
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.360]  and you can get a couple guesses so if you think it's one two three four but it's really one two
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:26.560]  three three you know it might be you know you'd still have a good chance of getting the guess
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.560]  so my that's my top recommendation for anybody like me who's completely freaked by this is to
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.360]  treat entering your phone passcode as like state secret when you're out in public just if you ever
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:49.120]  need to do it and i think back to how many times i did it in line during covid and oh yeah so so
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.000]  often oh my god it is because we had to you know right and you know everyone you know the only
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.200]  thing is nobody was seeing our code because they were they kind of looked down at their phone up
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.760]  in there well the other the only thing we had going on in covid to protect us from this was
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.360]  that there was all the stores had those like tape markers six feet apart so everybody your
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.960]  next customer was six feet behind you but the number one thing you can do to protect yourself
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.760]  well i mean i guess a longer passcode or an alphanumeric passcode would help too because
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.520]  those are certainly harder something you type on the keyboard is sort of hard to to glean
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:30.160]  there's talk of i don't think anybody that joe you know none of the criminal cases that that she
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.360]  that she uncovered seemed to do it but there's talk of what if so you know can you use a camera
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:45.760]  to record the person doing it and then zoom in and see it and do it in slow motion in a bar scenario
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:54.320]  where the the crooks hopefully don't own the bar i think a camera would be tough right like it's not
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:00.800]  like you're going to get in there and place a camera in the bar and it would look weird if
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.360]  somebody you just met is standing there with their phone camera on shooting video at a way that would
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:15.760]  you know look at the level you know of your hand maybe though you know if you practice and do it
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:22.560]  and then you can use that video footage to decode it but an alphanumeric password would be really
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:30.320]  hard to get even if you had video of it although although as you type on an iphone keyboard
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.720]  every letter you press pops up the letter you hit yeah that's not great it's not it's great for
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.280]  the innocent case of knowing that you typed the right letter it's not great for the case of
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:53.440]  somebody shooting 4k video of you typing your password you know and figuring out exactly which
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.560]  letters and replaying it in slow motion right 4k 60 video and then replaying it in slow motion
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.400]  really really just mind-blowing you know and what should apple do differently
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.360]  i that's the thing like it's really hard to because again like you know they have they have
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.720]  this massive support and data loss issue for people who are forgetful of their stuff so like
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:23.360]  they do have to make these things easy to recover from like they have to make you know password
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.640]  forget forgetting you know easy to recover from that's i mean look i've developed a lot of web
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.440]  login stuff and one of the things that surprised me over the years was quite how many people just
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.400]  hit forgot password every time they log into something yeah because they don't even bother
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.880]  trying to remember it yeah and or they have so many passwords to remember they're just like
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.560]  ah this will be faster than me trying a bunch of passwords and forgetting anyway you know so they
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:52.640]  just go straight for forgot password like people don't remember passwords it's simple as that and
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.440]  especially you know your apple id you figure well that's again they have all those security
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:03.280]  requirements for the apple id password and so that makes it easier to forget and it makes it
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:09.040]  makes it less it makes it more likely that you won't be able to use your one password in your
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.400]  head that you use for everything and yes i know that's bad that's what everyone does so they they
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:21.120]  need ways for people to easily reset their apple id passwords and man like this is just a hard
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.000]  problem and you know and i think did your research indicate i think i saw floating around earlier
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.520]  that like even if you have your your account in like the the full encryption end-to-end mode and
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.320]  you know whatever mode you can put your apple id in there is no mode that disables that right
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.920]  there is no mode that disables that and i think that would be like the the one thing i can think
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:47.360]  of is what apple should do here is maybe if you have end-to-end encryption on maybe that can be
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:51.120]  one of the things that's different about your account that you cannot reset your apple id
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:05:03.680]  password with a phone passcode maybe um i you know and i can confirm that apple from you know
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:09.520]  i reached out i had so i had some questions and you know in addition to questions about this
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:16.560]  story with with with uh that joanna reported i was very confused over the weekend by the fact
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:26.080]  that i could not figure out how to even enter a recovery key or use a recovery contact like
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:34.400]  i have a a not fake but a testing icloud account that i've used for years to have like if i'm
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:41.680]  reviewing two iphones at once um or just want to set one up with default settings for everything
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:48.480]  so i have a sort of throwaway icloud account so i was in a trying to i sent myself my real
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:54.640]  icl account as the recovery contact for that phone pretended that phone was stolen and i couldn't
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.080]  and i couldn't even enter those things there was no i couldn't there's no path to get to where you
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.160]  just type the 28 characters or use the recovery context say i vouch for this person and give it
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:11.600]  back to them so i had questions about that and talking to people at apple i can confirm that
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.280]  they are thinking of they and i've long been thinking about things they could do for this
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:26.720]  but at the at the moment this is the best balance between the needs of the vast number of people who
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:36.080]  forget their icloud account password and the uh terribly unfortunate but lower number of people
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:45.360]  who fall victim to this path for crime it's it's really it's our it's and i i think the fact that
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:51.360]  google does it the same way with android is conf you know not you know two doesn't prove it but
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:58.880]  both companies are known for you know right justly so for very good security policies
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:06.720]  towards users um you know google perhaps even more so you know and they do it the same way
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:14.160]  it's it's just sort and i think you know one of the reasons we don't know about it is that we
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:20.160]  just didn't think about it but the people at apple who think about these security things have known
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:26.640]  this this is not this is not a surprise to them but i think that you know for obvious reasons
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:33.360]  they don't like warn people about it because they'd rather maybe they'd rather people don't
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:40.800]  the general public doesn't know how dangerous this is right it's it you know it's like finding out
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.240]  that we they know now right it's like finding out we've been walking around with with a powerful
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.920]  you know m80 firecracker in our pocket all the time unbeknownst to us and it might go off um
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:01.600]  again protecting your passcode and not entering it in front of somebody um you know is the best
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:09.360]  thing i can say the the downside to that or the hole in that is the other scenario the the the
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:17.840]  mugging scenario where you are out in the street and somebody you know a mugger comes up with a
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.800]  weapon and demands your phone and demands your passcode and you know right there on the street
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:32.320]  corner give me your phone give me your passcode right now i don't you know there's there's no
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:38.640]  it's catastrophic it's that's far i mean you that's always like a week ago i would have said
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.640]  yeah you're kind of screwed at that point you know you're really screwed now i realize you're
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:51.440]  really really screwed in that scenario and you know i don't know what you know what do you do
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:09:02.240]  it's it's it's worrisome it's it's had me obsessed for like 72 hours it it's it's it's
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.640]  the good news is at least from the the people joanna and nicole uh talk to i don't think any
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:15.360]  of them had their phones taken by force that way they all had them you know in this or at least
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.560]  not their passcode sometimes you know they would they'd take the phone by force but not the passcode
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:26.960]  and the other thing about this is all these victims were so confused because they didn't
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.640]  understand how this happened they didn't know their passcode had been gleaned over their
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.240]  shoulder all they know is their phone was missing i don't know where my phone is where is it and next
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:43.200]  thing they know uh ten thousand dollars have been taken out of their bank account and they're like
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:47.200]  how did that happen all i did was lose my phone and all of a sudden i've lost stuff in my bank
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:54.080]  account i i i wrote a story in joanna told me it sort of inspired part of her obsession to dig into
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:10:01.440]  this this was in august of 2020 so actually in the middle of covid there was a guy named and
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:09.200]  anriq prong i hope i'm pronouncing his name right probably not but on twitter i swear to god i will
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.480]  put a link to this thing in the show notes can the the headline was on daring fireball was can
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.960]  thieves crack six digit iphone passcodes on twitter this guy wrote stop using six digit
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.440]  iphone passcodes do you think i am overly paranoid keep reading last week a friend of mine had his
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.840]  iphone stolen what follows is the secret events that started as an unfortunate event and ended
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.680]  up with thirty thousand dollars in unauthorized wire transfers twenty five hundred dollars spent
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.800]  on the app store and accounts of multiple services compromised so how could the wrongdoers do all of
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.320]  that in less than five hours after considering many options the only reasonable explanation
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.440]  is they cracked the six digit passcode on the stolen phone using some kind of device like gray
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.680]  key the passcode gave them access to the keychain they searched for iclode credentials disabled the
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:05.520]  lost mode and turned off the fine line that's this guy's story of his friend and what i wrote was
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.800]  did the thieves really crack his passcode with a gray key or a gray key like device impossible to
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:22.800]  say we know it exists blah blah blah but i wrote all this and it never occurred to me that i think
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.520]  it's exact i think what happened to this guy's friend on twitter is exactly what it is i think
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:34.480]  somebody probably just saw him enter the passcode that's it it wasn't yeah we all jumped to so i did
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.840]  we all jumped to some kind of mission impossible style thing where the thieves have this complicated
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:45.840]  device and those devices do exist right these these there's that gray keys i think the israeli
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.880]  company there's a florida company you know and they make these devices and supposedly only sell
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:56.640]  them to law enforcement and we all jump to this mission impossible scenario where the thieves
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.160]  have this complicated thing and it's so much easier to think about the scenario where you
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.240]  just saw the you know shoulder shoulder swipe the shoulder glean the guy entering his passcode and
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.240]  then stole his phone and now you've got his passcode and now you've got all of this yeah
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:19.040]  like because again like that's the hole that most people i don't think knew about that that you can
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.920]  you could turn an iphone passcode into an apple id no one i don't think any of us knew that yeah
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:30.400]  yeah i was on to it honestly i did this article makes me so mad it's like here i wrote it never
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.520]  simply this is my words from august 2020 it simply never occurred to me that if a thief
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:42.480]  or law enforcement or any adversary has the device passcode and your iCloud password is in the in your
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:49.520]  keychain they can get your iCloud password from your keychain that's what we were thinking all
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:56.400]  you need is the device passcode to access all of the passwords in iCloud keychain try it you can
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.520]  now where i'm wrong there is you don't even have to go into passwords there's this that feature we
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:07.280]  talked about a couple minutes ago where you you don't have to even get the old passcode you it
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:14.400]  just that's how ignorant i was though in august of 2020 i thought you had to get the old pass
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:21.680]  iCloud passcode to change it to a new one you don't you just go into the top part the top thing
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:29.200]  and settings and the top thing in iCloud passcode and security and the top thing and that is change
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:35.680]  passcode and you just change it to something new and that's it although i do know i this is a nice
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.360]  reminder i am now reminded here's what i wrote so now i'm back on an alphanumeric passphrase
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:47.600]  inconvenience while wearing a mask be damned so that's what i did i changed back to an inconvenient
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.920]  alphanumeric passcode in august of 2020 because of this story but i was thinking about
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.880]  again a mission impossible style complicated villains and not common street criminals who
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.600]  just saw me enter the passcode but that's how long i've been using an alphanumeric password
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:15.520]  really really unbelievable story i just can't stop thinking about it yeah it's this i this is
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:21.040]  that's why i said like this is a bombshell like this no one knew this and this is very you know
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:26.560]  this changes things you know what it reminds me of and i don't mind the the catastrophe and you
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:32.480]  know you can go to your bank and get the charges returned and and you know overturned and and and
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:39.200]  you know fraud detection and stuff like that so i'm not drawing i swear to god i'm not drawing
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:46.480]  any kind of comparison to the repercussions but it reminds me of 9 11 in the sense of
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:56.240]  that before 9 11 it just never occurred to anybody that our airline policies for decades
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:05.520]  because like in the 60s and 70s there was a rash it was common for uh uh protest groups to hijack
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:13.920]  airplanes there were high airplane hijackings happened you know like every year in the 60s
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:21.600]  like every year in the 60s and 70s and they you know they'd you know some group would want some
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.520]  somebody who's in prison in some country released or something like that some kind of protest type
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.600]  thing and every time all of these times when airplanes were hijacked they just the policy was
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:41.040]  you just placate the hijackers land the plane uh keep everybody safe tell them you know we'll
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.960]  listen to you over your demands and every time they'd you know to get out of it without people
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:53.200]  being killed or maybe i don't know if every time they didn't kill any passengers but that was the
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.080]  policy if somebody tries to hijack the airplane you say okay okay we don't how about this we'll
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.040]  land the plane blah blah blah you don't fight them you don't you know you don't do anything like that
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:10.400]  so it just never even occurred to anybody that all these all you'd have to do is go on an airplane
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:21.680]  with box cutters and demand that the that the flight crew comply with you and if they do that
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:31.440]  and they know how to steer an airplane that all of a sudden they could use a Boeing 747 full of
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:41.760]  cross-continental tank of jet fuel as a as a bomb it just never occurred to anybody yet after they
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:49.120]  did it it it seemed uh you know like how how did nobody ever think of this right how how how did
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:56.720]  nobody ever think of that and to me this is sort of that sort of psychological you know it's like
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.000]  you know it's like like the way optical illusions work like our brains just weren't hooked up
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.840]  to see what was right in front of us this is right in front of us when you look at the way
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:14.400]  the settings app works on any iphone or any android phone yeah i hope i know you don't think
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.480]  i'm going to get in trouble for comparing it to 911 do you because it's it's not the nine
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:25.520]  well it's right but it's it's a yeah like it's it reveals a vulnerability that we didn't know
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:30.480]  about really or that we didn't think about right it's uh just the most bizarre thing all right let

[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:09.440]  appreciate it the only funny thing about this whole that whole iphone this whole iphone hey
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:14.480]  if you've got the passcode and the phone you're totally screwed if a thief has that you're totally
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:25.520]  screwed it's that it's exact works exactly the same way on android but all of the victims had
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:32.400]  iphones in joanna's story and when she talked to this detective in minneapolis uh i looked it up it
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:39.120]  was 40 cases just one detective had dealt with one detective had dealt with 40 cases of the exact
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:46.880]  same thing and he told her 99 99 of them are iphones and that he thinks it's because because
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:53.760]  iphones have resale value and nobody wants to steal android phones or thinks that the people
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:59.840]  who have android phones have anything worth worth stealing oh god oh wow
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:10.480]  yeah that's i mean that that is both funny and also you know probably not entirely untrue it's
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.960]  it's not that you know obviously yeah we can poke fun as apple fans and you know but but there is
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.520]  you know the markets are not equivalent we know that like we know in lots of ways they're not
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.600]  equivalent it isn't just like you know a random selection of you know whatever the market share
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:29.920]  is you know 60 40 70 whatever it is it's like it isn't a random selection of people that go
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:34.400]  to one side or the other like it's it's actually very different markets this is why like you know
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:40.320]  i have a podcast app that is iphone only and that doesn't really hurt me at all in any meaningful
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:46.080]  way because the you know while there are more android devices in the world than there are
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:54.160]  iphones the reality is that the podcast listening market is extremely iphone dominant still
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.200]  and so you know even though it is you know a bigger number over on the android side it's
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.480]  way fewer of my actual potential customers there and you know markets aren't the markets aren't the
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:14.400]  same there was a i think nine to five mac had the story that apple should make an ad campaign out
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.280]  of it i know you're not heavily into sports but you might have seen the news that lebron james
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:26.640]  broke the all-time scoring record in the nba a week or two ago which is a major record in
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:32.880]  other words to be the the one basketball player more than kareem abdul jabbar or will chamberlain
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:38.720]  or michael jordan the most points any players ever scored and there's a this picture a really
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:45.680]  a really great picture of him taking the shot that will wound up putting him over the record
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:54.800]  and you know of course a full crowd in the la arena and and you look you can see the
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.600]  pictures big enough and crisp enough and you can see that almost everybody's got their phone out
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:06.640]  there everybody's trying to take a picture of it and they're all iphones or if they're not or or
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:13.200]  they're there aren't many of these i either you know but i think there's more of them in china but
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:20.400]  in theory they could be the rare android phone that is designed to have an iphone look-alike
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:28.240]  camera array but you know as many ways that android phones copy or follow apple's lead in
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.880]  design like oh apple's gone to flat sides we're going to start making our phones with flat sides
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.080]  oh apple's going back to rounded sides next year all the android phones have rounded sides but the
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:45.280]  camera arrays will usually look very different um it's you know and again it's just you know the
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:52.960]  sort of people who pay the tickets to that event where i don't know what they cost you know they
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.280]  were hundreds and hundreds of dollars it was super expensive more than the phone probably oh yeah but
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.840]  the ticket oh the tickets down close enough to the floor that you would be in this photo were
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:09.040]  probably thousands of dollars all of them were thou you know unless you had like season tickets
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:15.600]  but la lakers tickets season tickets are very expensive anyway so the sort of people who get
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.280]  really good seats to a lakers game all have iphones it's it's really you know
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:31.360]  uh like you said a different market but kind of funny uh all right home pod home pod two
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.600]  what should we call it what do we want to call the new home yeah the the new home pod
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:44.880]  but how many do you have uh only two so far okay so but you have to uh you
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:52.880]  you did side-by-side testing same you you set up a thing it did you do it in your in the kitchen
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.240]  yep sure did because that's where you listen to music side by side yeah yeah it's like you know
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.360]  as as much as a fan as i am of the home pods you know you you use different speakers for
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:10.160]  different purposes and in different environments and for me where the home pod is by far the the
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:15.440]  class leader where it defeats all of the competition is as a kitchen counter speaker
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.080]  it is so much better than everything else in that market you know for a kitchen counter speaker and
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.960]  it's also good in lots of other ways and lots of other uses but that's where i use mine and
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.880]  that's where i've had the the least luck with anything else trying to replace it and and that's
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:39.440]  where the home pod really kicks everyone else's butts really pretty significantly uh so what do
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:49.120]  you think it's pretty good yeah so basically you know that i i've used lots of things in this role
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:53.440]  i've tried them out you know i've i've have obviously i have the you know the current home
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:00.000]  pod i had the previous home pod i've had the home pod mini i've had stereo pairs of all of those
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.880]  i've had the sonos one and a couple of ridiculously expensive things from bno that i briefly tried and
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:13.440]  quickly returned uh and uh i think i tried a couple of things but and that's the oh and the
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:19.920]  original amazon alexa uh or amazon echo rather um and then one of the the i think the current
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.320]  mid-range model amazon echo which is like kind of the big ball shaped one yeah you had so i've tried
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:30.320]  all of those you had the bno one when we were when we were there this summer i did yeah it wasn't bad
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:37.440]  it sounded it wasn't bad but it sounded about as good as the home pod minis right and it was
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.000]  substantially more expensive than them and so it wasn't really worth it right so and and bno had
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.240]  like they had like a larger one that actually sounded about as good as the home pod but it was
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:53.920]  way bigger and way more expensive and so that also did not stick around so you know in other areas of
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:58.880]  the house i i think you can you can find things that are a little bit more competitive if you're
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:04.880]  willing to you know adjust things a little bit like if you want great sounding speakers for your
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:11.440]  tv you have lots of options they're mostly going to be way larger and they're going to require like
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:17.520]  a receiver or or some kind of amplification setup it's going to be larger or more complicated um if
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:22.320]  you want something on your desk i actually don't use home pods on my desk because there is no good
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.080]  way to have them be speakers for your mac there's a few bad ways um but there's there's no good way
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.440]  and and so on my desk i have regular speakers with a little amp you know stuck to the bottom
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:39.760]  of the desk um and so there's places where home pods are not as competitive uh but when you want
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.480]  to beam sound in all directions from a kitchen counter where you're frequently going to be
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.320]  working like on like to the side of it not right in front of it uh and you and you want to like
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.600]  you know fill a space like that with good quality sound nothing is like the home pod uh the full
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.160]  size home pod the home pod mini actually does better than most of the competitors do at any
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.440]  price for that kind of use but the full size home pod really takes it to another level compared to
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.880]  the mini also so it's it's a really great product line for a few areas of my life that i really want
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:16.240]  them they're also really good as like bathroom and bedroom speakers you know if you want just like
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:20.240]  something to play a podcast while you're in the shower or you want like you know to listen to
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.680]  some music you know in your bedroom quietly before you go to bed for some reason like
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.360]  you know it's they're great for that as well and again they're small and they're low needs you
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.760]  don't need a big box you only have the one power cable come out of it you have nothing else to
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:39.680]  deal with no other wires and and the home pods themselves are small and tasteful looking um you
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.440]  know if you have anyone else in your house that has to uh approve of the look of things that are
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.640]  going into these areas of your house um the home pods are pretty inoffensive looking um you know
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.200]  they come in the two different colors we were we are a white home pod family um i think they look
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:03.520]  very nice and it's just great for that and there are alternatives from other brands most most
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:10.560]  commonly people tell me to try the sonos series and i have and they they are good many things
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.080]  they are not competitive on sound quality and that's that's really important to me right your
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:23.840]  pal uh casey is is on team sonos now newly so i've been a huge fan of the home pods ever since
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:31.360]  they came out now i don't have a good taste in audio like you do i just know that i don't you
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:41.200]  know and in the way that uh i i think you you would probably admit i have a finer tuned taste
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.960]  for typography than you do right oh yeah you might come to me and ask and you well that's i
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:54.320]  actually you have come to me and asked yeah typographic taste questions i would come to you
[01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:01.920]  and i have for audio uh taste questions it's it's it's almost it's not even that i have bad hearing
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:07.920]  it's just that i don't my taste doesn't run that way and i've long been obsessed with the fact that
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:16.000]  people who lack taste in an area sometimes fall into the trap of thinking of who anybody who does
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.040]  have good taste in that area is actually just full of shit and pretentious even though sometimes
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:27.200]  that's true right like the people who buy thousand dollar gold cables to hook up their speakers and
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:33.280]  think that that makes them sound better than copper cables right the cables you know it's
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:38.960]  just running electricity it's you know the there's there's scams in audio right there's
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.520]  audio many right i mean we could do a whole show about the scams in audio
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:51.040]  but there actually is you know refinement and headphones and and you know you've written
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:58.080]  super extensively about headphones but i do know what sounds you know i'm not completely without
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:05.200]  taste in in audio quality and i think home pods sound great one one area and i've been listening
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:11.600]  to you guys on atp talk about them uh for weeks now one area where i disagree or at least i
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:19.520]  disagree personally is i've been using home pods from my living room home theater since early 2020
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:28.000]  yeah a while yeah we completed a home renovation by coincidence well 98 completed a home renovation
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:35.520]  before the world shut down for covet or 99 percent it was you know literally like there are our
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:43.520]  contractors were in on the friday that was the last day where it was legal to be out to be out
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.360]  in the world cleaning up some stuff and doing some final work now one little bit of that work
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:32:00.640]  is actually very specific to home pods by pure coincidence but on the last day that that friday
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:10.480]  in march 2020 one of the last things i had the contractors do was we've we've got you know the
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:16.560]  living room the couch faces a wall and that wall is very obvious the whole design is that's where
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:22.000]  a tv would go i i'm not i guess you could hang a big somebody who doesn't watch tv and bought our
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.040]  house could put some kind of very large painting there but it's you know it's it's a wall with
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:35.840]  like an inset and in the inset goes the tv and then underneath it is a built-in cabinet you know
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:42.400]  like knee-high where the components can go and i knew that all of the components that we use
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:48.880]  now don't require line of sight for the remote controls so none of them you know they slide and
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:53.760]  they can be covered up and it's nice and neat looking and you don't see the tivo you don't see
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:59.920]  the apple tv you don't see the switch it's all you know you just slide a thing open but what i wanted
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:05.440]  was on top of that cabinet i think they're called grommets or maybe the grommets are the things you
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:11.040]  put on holes but you drill holes on the top so that i could put cabinets on top of the cabinet
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:18.560]  so that i could put cables through yep i and i had them already on the built i have a desk in
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:25.520]  my office that's built into the wall and it has holes that are drilled on the top where i can
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:31.840]  snake cables through them because the cabinet is built into the wall you can't go behind the wall
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:42.560]  and the you know and the guy said okay i got you you know and and did them well they are just
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:54.960]  not quite big enough to put the power cable of a home pod through because i was thinking of things
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:03.760]  of things like hdmi cables and power cables and every cable i could think of i thought well i
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.360]  thought he was like how about the you know i was there with him right there over his shoulder he
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.320]  was like how about this big and i thought i thought of all the things i thought i'd ever
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:18.640]  want to go through that would easily be a big a large enough diameter and i was like sure because
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:24.960]  i'm also thinking i don't want it too big i don't want amy to come in here and say why the hell did
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:34.720]  you put a you know a golf a golf hole size grapefruit size hole on this thing right and
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.400]  it was a hurry like i couldn't like double check with her i couldn't wait it was you know we weren't
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.760]  like in a mad dash but it was like the guy was here he wasn't going to be able to come back
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:53.520]  for well at the time we thought weeks turned out it was forever i was like sure that's big enough
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.880]  and then when i i didn't know at the time that i'd use home pods for the audio it was weeks
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.520]  a week or two several weeks later during covid where i thought let me try using a home pod as the
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:12.160]  the home theater and lo and behold the goddamn power cable wouldn't go through the hole just
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:20.080]  just not quite enough right like and but like definitely not the sort of thing where there was
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:26.000]  like oh this is so close that i could maybe shave off plastic on the power cable or you know no it
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.880]  just wouldn't fit and one of the design aspects curious design aspects of the original home pods
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:39.120]  is that the power cables are built into the home pod well they're not really removable right not
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:44.560]  not not reasonably so at least uh i don't know i don't i forget if i pointed this out to you when
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:51.280]  you were at my house but so one of the things i've heard about from other people in the house
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:36:00.320]  is that our power cables for our home pods have to be pretty visible even though the home pods
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.720]  are literally sitting inches away from those grommets or holes they're inches away from them
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:14.080]  there those holes are are in the corners where the home pods sit but the power cables have to
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:19.920]  go around them you know in four or five feet away to the nearest power outlets that are
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:29.040]  not inside this cabinet so if oh my god so my very favorite feature of home pod 2 very favorite of
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:36.160]  all the differences is the fact that the power cable is removable it's just a standard little
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:42.800]  that figure eight style power cable yeah like a c c8 i think or c7 right so i can go the other way
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:49.600]  play i can now plug the the the the power thing into the into the power outlet that's hidden
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:55.440]  inside the cabinet and then snake the cable out and then re-plug it into the home pod
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:03.040]  and if they had changed nothing else it just brought back the one that they discontinued
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:08.080]  two years ago with no other changes but that i would still buy two new ones
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.800]  because it would make some people in the house very happy
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:21.440]  so that's amazing so that's that's one thing like at no point did you figure like
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:26.880]  why don't i like you know just widen the hole a little bit i know i aesthetically it's tricky but
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:34.320]  like look i'm not a handy person i'm not a person it just but one of the few tools i know how to use
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.760]  is the drill and i learned a few years ago about this thing called a hole saw which is basically
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.480]  like a circle of teeth you attach to a drill to make holes that are bigger than drill bits
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:49.200]  and i figured out how to do that and so i i went the first thing i did when i learned to do that
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.680]  was i went to our tv stand which is made of wood and like it has like you know this cabinet under
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.880]  and i went in the back and i drilled some giant holes to snake a bunch of cables through you know
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:06.880]  it was glorious you know if i had heard more about this exposed these two exposed power cables i
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.920]  probably would have looked into it but eventually i stopped hearing about it and so i i didn't look
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:17.120]  into that but who's the smart guy now i don't need it because i'm gonna i'm gonna buy two new home pods
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:26.320]  um but i have been a happy user of home pod now again maybe it's because my taste in audio isn't
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:32.640]  good enough but i previously and our our other home theater setup which is upstairs in our like
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:41.440]  guest room study area which we had used for years had a a sony audio system it has a receiver it's
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:50.960]  the traditional home theater type thing it has a sony receiver it has uh uh two left and right
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:39:01.360]  front speakers a separate subwoofer a center a center speaker and two rear speakers so for
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.000]  surround sound which i'd given up on at some point because i never i actually thought it was
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.440]  less pleasant i it actually to me movies and tv shows sounded better with all everything coming
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.480]  from the tv in the front and then from the rear but it's you know i don't know what i i didn't
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.480]  spend a fortune on it because i bought it a long time ago and didn't have a fortune to spend but
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:27.440]  i mean it's i don't know probably a thousand dollar system or you know maybe more i don't know
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:33.360]  all told um and it was good and i was happy with it for many many many years all the years i used
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:41.120]  all the years i used my pioneer i can't believe i forgot pioneers name my beloved pioneer plasma tv
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.680]  you ever hear of any of those are so good i there's i do we have any mutual friends who are
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:51.680]  fans of plasma tvs i'm drawn up on the tip of my tongue we might have we might have a few so but
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:57.280]  like and what often gets lost in that is that i also had one just a long time ago and it was
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:03.840]  amazing it wasn't amazing as john's of course but it was oh man i plasmas were great and for the
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.720]  time just so much better than everything else there really really were so much better than
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:16.400]  generations of else i skipped so i had never i've never owned an lcd tv i've i went from plasma to
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:21.440]  oled um yeah that's that's the wise move lcd is awful uh which again i think is exactly what
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:28.640]  syracuse did right is he went directly from plasma to to oled but i had he knew lcd's are awful but
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:34.960]  i had this other this sony home theater system and i had been complaining i've mentioned it on
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:40.320]  the show for years that especially with like hbo shows as like i could never understand what the
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:46.160]  hell people were saying and i i had a center i had it and people say oh it's because the dialogue's
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:54.080]  on the center channel and it's like i got a center speaker i still get the you know and i'm like what
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:41:00.080]  the hell did they say i can't understand it and then what after covid for a while what we did is
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:06.400]  we were only using the speakers that were because i wanted to get a good home theater system because
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.280]  this was all part of the plan to we you know spent a lot of money to redo the living room and get it
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:20.080]  exactly the way we wanted and i got exactly the the else lg oled giant 77 inch or whatever how big
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:27.280]  it is oled whatever the biggest oled they make or made in 2020 and it was the best tv i could buy
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:34.720]  you know it was great for me as somebody who's paralyzed by choice because all i knew was i
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:41.360]  wanted the biggest oled i could get and lg was the only company i heard that made one like that and
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.280]  i didn't want to sam i knew i didn't want samsung so it was this this model from lg that was it and
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:53.200]  i got it and it's beautiful but for months after after we got back into our living room
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.160]  when covid started we just played all the audio through the tv speakers and they're not bad they
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:08.800]  really and my wife and son agreed that the audio quality was was really surprisingly good for just
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:13.920]  coming out of the tv although i guess when you spend a lot on the tv maybe that's not surprising
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:19.680]  but i was like it wasn't good enough and so i thought well let me try the home pods before i
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:27.200]  go and buy something expensive and tried the home pods and i was like this is good this is fantastic
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.640]  i love it including and and to me this is the thing that i think i i maybe i'm not 100% caught
[01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.480]  up on the very latest atp i forget if i finished it or not but i don't think now you're in the
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:44.880]  after show talking about uh the rivians so um the the thing that you guys were talking about and
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:50.080]  that syracuse was talking about is if you only have two home pods something something blah blah
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.760]  blah the center and the center is where you get the dialogue i'm telling you with two home pods
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:02.960]  and i have a big living room pretty big living room in an open floor plan the whole it's a big
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.120]  because our dining room is right behind us so it's not a contained room it's a it's a
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:14.880]  harsh audio scenario and because the tv is so big and it is a fairly big room
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:22.880]  i think it's acoustically challenging two home pods left and right of the tv i it sounds like
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:31.840]  stuff comes from the center and i i think that the complexity of modern prestige tv and movies
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:40.640]  audio mixes and and then just watching generic stuff on tv like sports or whatever whatever the
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:48.320]  home pods are doing computationally in the same way that they compute the echo acoustics of the
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:58.320]  room they fake the center better as good there's no way that i i could spend five thousand dollars
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:04.000]  on an audio system and i wouldn't i it certainly could be louder i'm sure but i don't think it
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.680]  would sound better and i get i'm sure i could get a lot more bass with an actual subwoofer no doubt
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:14.240]  about there's no question about that that and i know that i know that we used to have more base
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.280]  with our previous system that had a dedicated subwoofer that wasn't even like super premium
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.760]  model i know we're missing out on bass and that's and that's by the way that's not really a fair
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:28.880]  comparison because like the home pod is really small like people i don't think people realize
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:34.400]  who don't have them how small they are for the amount of audio and quality you get out of them
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:39.280]  like they have a four inch woofer you know a subwoofer for a home theater you're gonna you're
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:46.320]  looking at at least six inches and usually much larger of a driver and so you know for for what
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:53.520]  it is it's incredible and you can't get anything that has that kind of sound in anything that is
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:00.400]  that size or smaller right like it is so it's the same way like in the 90s when everybody was blown
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.560]  away by bows and how bows managed to make these really tiny speakers that had really big sound
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.480]  and part of that was you know good engineering part of that was they introduced the external
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.800]  subwoofer to the world for the most part and so they they have these little tiny tweeters that
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.400]  would be your surround feeders and they have the giant subwoofer that you tuck in the corner
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:25.920]  somewhere but you know for home pods are incredible for their size they're also really good in absolute
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:30.240]  terms but of course you know when you have a bigger room or when you when you're comparing
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.840]  against much larger speakers yeah you can get better than a home pod but you cannot get anywhere
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:42.960]  near what the home pod offers in anything close to its size right and you remember i'm well you
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:50.080]  might remember this but while i was doing this i was of course picking your brain over what i
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:56.160]  should be might be maybe should be looking at speaker wise for this setup and you had sent
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:05.040]  me multiple selection multiple possible things and i'd show them to amy and it got some pretty
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:12.320]  quick thumbs down yep visually now and i'm not making fun you know nobody's pickier about the
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:18.400]  way some things look than me i'm pickier than i'm pickier about things i'm picky about than amy is
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.720]  about a way our living room looks so i'm not making fun of her i love her for it i love that
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:32.880]  she's that you know i i appreciate it but some of them were very tall and they all were forward and
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:38.960]  would have to be on the floor in front of it and the way that our living room is set up that's
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:48.800]  it's not how it was designed and so visually two white home pods in the corner on this on this
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:57.520]  cabinet under the tv it looks like the room was designed for that to be you know in terms of the
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:03.520]  visual effect it wasn't just okay that's fine we'll go with that she you know she was like
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:10.400]  that would be great that looks that looks awesome but i'm a hundred percent satisfied with the sound
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:18.480]  that i get out of them and the especially the the simulated center channel that they produce
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:26.320]  for dialogue and the what the fuck did that person just say is i it only happens to me now
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:34.640]  when i know that it's a show that is deliberately produced to have mumble mouth dialogue like game
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.680]  of thrones right like famously for whatever reason game of thrones makes everything way too dark i
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.080]  like the show i don't i don't like the new one that much but i like the other other one but
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:51.600]  it's a very dark show your tv isn't busted you don't have to turn the brightness up it's supposed
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:57.200]  to be that dark and they deliberately garbled the dialogue i don't know why i don't know why you
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:02.800]  would do that it's like i to me it's like there's certain there's always certain cinematic trends
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:08.880]  that you can look at a movie and if you've even if you've never seen the movie before you can say
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.480]  oh that movie was made in the early 80s 100 you just know it you don't have to look at hairstyles
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:22.160]  you just there's just certain you know cinematic things and mumble mouth dialogue is going to come
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:30.640]  across as like oh that was like in the late 2010s guaranteed yep so other than that though i love
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:37.360]  the center channel for i think it's a fantastic home theater thing um and i do love and appreciate
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:48.240]  uh and this is like the sort of casey list angle i love the 100 simplicity of setup one cable yes
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:55.040]  it goes to power and that's it i've always been it's always been in the back of my mind with my
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:00.000]  other stereo that i was never sure if i was hooking it up the right way right because you
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.400]  can hook up like the red and yellow and green cables or there you could go by an optical
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.960]  cable optical lens should i use optical what am i doing and it okay i've hooked this up
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:19.840]  turned it on and it sounds great to me and it's loud but did i should i use the other type of
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.760]  cable and then you've got all these cables there's all these cables running all over the place
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:35.360]  and what do you do with them uh i love the just and it to me it is it epitomizes the apple
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:43.120]  the apple mindset towards things where it's just there's there's just one way that's it it's and
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:51.920]  then you just hook it up to your apple tv you know through the apple tv interface and for me
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:56.800]  and it might here i am knocking on wood although i think this ikea desk i sit at for the podcast
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:05.760]  isn't really wood but you know whatever ikea made this out of um i've had no problems with any with
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:14.320]  like the apple tv maintaining connectivity to the home pods um i think there was one time so what
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:21.280]  was it sometime in the spring of 2020 so let's call it three years it's short of three years but
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:29.280]  in three years there was one time where one of the two home pods was sort of lost
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:38.960]  sort of confused and off you know unpaired and somehow refused started wandering away yeah
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:47.120]  and the trick was to unplug both of them because maybe the problem was with the other one and
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:51.760]  you know the one that didn't seem to be you know was still playing the tv audio i don't know
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:56.960]  unplugged them both plugged them back in and that's one time in three years where i had any
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:06.960]  sort of reliability of you know does this thing still work i really just fantastic for home
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:12.560]  theater now we also have a pair in our kitchen that the kitchen one we that's where we play
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:18.480]  music and that's where i listen to podcasts and do those sort of things with home pods
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:25.360]  those have been pretty reliable too more than most in my testing i've had a pair of the home
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:29.680]  pods too i was you know since before they came out whenever they announced them and i've been
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:34.960]  testing them i haven't written a review because i've i struggle because i feel like i don't have
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:42.960]  the audio taste to review that aspect of them properly these two have a hundred have been
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.160]  100 reliable for me once they were paired and i've had them paired non-stop ever since
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:58.320]  and i've been doinking around with them testing things um 100 reliable and i will say this
[01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:07.200]  the serie response time really is faster yes definitely i i guess that's the the going to
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:13.920]  the s7 chip or whatever the whatever the second generation chip is yeah skipping a few years in
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:21.440]  chip to get a faster cpu and faster whatever else whatever you know audio signal pop whatever
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:29.440]  they're doing to make it faster it they absolutely did it's not marketing trickery or that apple set
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:36.800]  up optimized ones it is noticeably faster and i know that it's faster because i'm testing these
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:44.560]  new ones in my office and i've got the old ones upstairs and so i'm you know it's like having
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.720]  spending half your time on a brand new iphone and half your time on a five-year-old iphone
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:57.200]  every day you every day you're like god damn this old iphone is slow
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.200]  so for me for me i i wanted i want you to talk more about audio quality because i don't notice
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:12.000]  it i can't tell any to me it sounds just just as good as the original home pods what i notice is
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:21.600]  it's faster and so i that's enough for me um but it seems sounds to me like or you know from your
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:29.200]  review on atp that you think they sound better yeah and they do sound different um overall
[01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:35.360]  you know they they sound they're in the ballpark of each other you know like it's if you don't have
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.240]  them side by side if you just you know upgrade from the first one to the second one and just
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:46.880]  start playing stuff you might not notice the difference um it's like it's it's that relatively
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:53.440]  small of one what you will most likely notice is that the new one has less bass and then the old
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:54:00.000]  one and that honestly i wish they would have that be some kind of eq control because i would love
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.200]  to turn it up a little bit on the new one because the old one the old one they often got complaints
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:09.200]  that it was too bassy especially if you live like in an apartment or if you're putting it in a
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.080]  smaller room where you'd really hear a lot of that bass resonance or your neighbors might hear it
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.760]  so it was good that they had a setting called reduce bass that they added shortly afterwards
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:26.080]  which basically is just like a a hard low pass filter so it just cuts out all of the bass it's
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  a pretty coarse setting um i would love to have that be an actual you know a setting maybe a
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:37.200]  slider that has like three or four positions on it you know so that you can have a little bit less
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:43.600]  a little bit less or a little bit more um i don't know it's people have developed eqs and bass knobs
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.280]  for decades uh and you know i know apple doesn't like adding unnecessary settings but i i think
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:55.120]  this this is such a situational and taste uh variable here of how much base you want your
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.760]  home pod to have i would love to see a setting for that well and and the new ones are a little
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:05.920]  bit lighter they give you a little bit of that with air pods right and air pods have a little
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:11.840]  bit of eq settings right um there's like a few things you can do but they're they're pretty
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:17.520]  limited right but that's what i would imagine they might do with home pod would be a limited
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:26.240]  very limited number of of tweaks and like a little more bassy a little less bassy or just two settings
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:34.320]  you know like a little less or a little more i could see them doing you know it just air pods
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.680]  like right air pods certainly aren't fiddly in terms of the amount of control you get over their
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.880]  sound quality i you know just a little bit would i agree would be nice yeah and they still won't
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:56.480]  add my my the the one setting i i want air pods to have so badly is i want to be able to for a
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:03.680]  particular pair of air pods to say never automatically jump to any other device oh yes
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:11.520]  because right now with the way our pods work is each pair of air pods by default will intelligently
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.120]  connect to any of your devices that are nearby and the things you might be wanting to use
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.600]  and it'll also offer it'll put that little dialogue thing in the corner saying hey connect
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:24.560]  to you know marco's air pods number two or whatever like it'll it'll offer that on apple
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:33.280]  tvs on max like and it currently if you want to have your air pods not auto switch you have to go
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:41.040]  to every single device that they might pair to every phone every ipad every mac every apple tv
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:45.920]  i think even like you have to go to every single device they might pair to and go and connect to
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:50.880]  it to it first and then go to your pod settings in the bluetooth settings and say don't automatically
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:55.120]  connect this device like it only when it's last paired or whatever yeah and you have to go through
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:57:00.080]  that for every single device if you get a new pair of air pods or if you get a new apple device that
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:04.960]  the airport might connect to you have to do it again watch it's you have to do it for everything
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.520]  and also that setting conveniently seems to get forgotten sometimes that's the most infuriating
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.520]  part is that you can set you can go through the hassle of setting this all up to say all right
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:19.520]  i never want my air pods to automatically guess what i want them to connect to just connect to
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.760]  the last thing i had them connected to all the time well and the and you can do all that and
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:27.440]  then two weeks later it'll forget that setting yeah and then you have to do it all again or
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:31.360]  just eventually give up and say fine i'm just going to have these be buggy like i cannot tell
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:38.080]  you as an air pods user myself how often it connects to the wrong thing and then also again
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.520]  being an audio app developer i get bug reports from people all the time saying something to the
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:50.720]  effect of overcast just randomly stops playing sometimes and i actually and i went and i i added
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:55.760]  logging to the app and there's like you know when you send in a feedback email to me you can attach
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:03.760]  the logs if you want to and in in part of the logs i log every play and pause event for the last you
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:09.680]  know a couple hours whatever um i log every play and pause event and i started logging what caused
[01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:15.040]  them why why did this pause and there's different things like you tap the button in the ui or a
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:22.000]  phone call came in or you know different you know you tap the control center button and i can tell
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:26.240]  when it's most likely air pods disconnecting and reconnect to something else because the most
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:33.280]  common case is someone has their air pods in they enter their house or a device becomes available
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:38.640]  within range just barely or something and then the air pods get automatically taken off of
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.880]  their phone that was playing overcast and they it goes in pairs to you know their computer or
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:48.080]  something and i can see right on my log that it said it says their device name and it's like you
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:53.680]  know joe's air pods no longer available like and that's and i see that and people are emailing me
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:58.000]  constantly because they're they don't know how blaming me blaming my app saying that it's buggy
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.800]  it just stops randomly when really it's air pod auto switching being doing something that they
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:08.880]  didn't expect or want yeah and i just i just give me a setting so i can say on a particular pair of
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:16.080]  air pods never auto connect to other devices just stay connected to whatever i last connected you to
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:24.080]  that's it and i god that one setting would make air pods so much better in the same way i want
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:29.280]  one setting on home pods in addition to the base you know boosting that's that's one thing but
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:37.200]  home pods have this mode that by far the most bugs that i've seen on home pods relate to this
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:44.400]  behavior that if you are playing from your iphone and you want to play something on your home pod
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:50.000]  there's two different modes this can be sent in there's airplay and there's handoff or i think i
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.000]  don't know if they they don't really describe it so i'm gonna call it handoff because it it seems
[01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.960]  to work like handoff um but so in airplay mode your phone continuously streams the audio of
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:05.920]  whatever you're playing to the home pod your phone remains the source it remains in full control
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.560]  and it there's a buffer you know so you can like you know take the trash out come back in and it
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:15.520]  probably won't skip because it's a buffer of about two minutes but you but your phone is still in
[02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:21.520]  control uh so if your phone has to reboot or something or you know whatever like it the music
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:29.840]  will stop um then there is handoff mode where if you are telling if you have something from apple
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:35.440]  music in particular it has to or not not the service the app if you're using apple's music app
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:42.240]  and you tell it to play on a home pod your phone does not keep that connection alive itself your
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:48.640]  phone tells the home pod hey go play this thing from apple music or from from my apple music
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.720]  collection whatever it is it works with itunes match and stuff too but it's you know but go play
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:58.160]  this thing using apple music and then the home pod kind of like wakes up its own software stack
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:04.080]  to launch some version of a music app on the home pod and then your phone is out of the picture so
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:09.680]  your phone is then your phone is your home pod says all right i got this from here and it takes
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:14.640]  over and it plays and then this this does allow some convenient behavior so for instance when the
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:20.240]  home pod has taken over the session like this for for apple music playback uh anyone on your wi-fi
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.520]  network can go into control center and take over the home pod and see you know all the things it's
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.440]  playing what it's about to play you can take over the whole session the same way like when when you
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:34.400]  when you connect to a home pod from control center and it like opens it up in your music app and then
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:37.680]  you're kind and then you're controlling it right anyone in your house can do that so it doesn't
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:42.400]  have to have been the phone that started it anyone can do it and you can also do it if you if you
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:47.440]  have it play you know through a siri command if you tell if you tell it via siri hey go play the
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:54.400]  rolling stones and apple music is not down that hour um if it actually works uh then then anybody
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.040]  in your house can then connect to it from their phone take over the session and direct it or edit
[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:06.080]  it or you know change what's up next or whatever else the problem is this behavior is really slow
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:11.600]  and historically has been really buggy now it is less bad on the new home pods because they're
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.480]  faster and they might have a newer software stack in some way because it's kind of a different
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:20.560]  situation there but for the most part they're just faster and that makes a lot of these problems less
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:27.360]  bad but that is by far the biggest source of bugs that i've seen where you know and not just not
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:30.800]  just with the new ones i i don't i haven't had the new ones for long enough to really have a
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.840]  good idea yet of how big of a problem it is on them on the old ones and also on the home pod
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:43.200]  minis which are much newer um this has been a big problem where so often a stereo pairing will fail
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.880]  that way or where one of them will drop out or um it will you'll you'll try to send it over to
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:53.760]  the home pods and it will it'll attempt the handoff and it will fail and then and and the
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:59.520]  home pod will then not play the music or it'll play the music but then it'll like reset your
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:04.400]  phone's situation in the handoff and then like your phone will have the wrong track showing and
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.800]  will not be able to control the home pod like there are so many ways that fails so in addition
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:13.120]  to my airpods setting request of never auto connect to anything please for these airpods
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.920]  i would love a home pod feature a checkbox in the home pod preferences to disable handoff
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:26.000]  hmm to make it never do that because there are ways around this so if the app that you're playing
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  music from on your phone is not apple's music app it won't do this so i and i so i'm constantly
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  going between apple music app and overcast and so with overcast this problem never happens because
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.040]  it's never the home pod is never taking over the session it's always streaming it from the phone
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.560]  and so it's always rock solve reliable you'll also notice like when you're in this mode
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.400]  it's when you when you are on the phone and you say go play this on you know kitchen or whatever
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.120]  whatever the home pods are it's way faster to connect and start playing and then when you're
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:59.120]  done it's way faster to disconnect if when you when you go back to the airplane picker on your
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:05.120]  phone and say switch back to iphone way faster to disconnect and and way more reliable as well yeah
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.200]  there's tons of benefits to this and so you know i could just use spotify or something but i don't
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:14.160]  want to it sucks yeah so i'd rather stay with apple music apps which sucks less still still
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:20.800]  sucks if i'm honest but it sucks a lot less or at least in different ways but so and there's also
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:27.200]  if you make a shortcut you can make a shortcut that says uh set playback destination and that
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:31.600]  and then you can have either pick from a menu or you can set a particular one if you do that
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.160]  while playing from apple music i actually have these shortcuts configured on my phone to do this
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:41.600]  you can make you can force apple music to stream the behavior to the stream behavior and not do
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:48.080]  handoff and it is so much better and and the way you can tell whether you're in this mode is
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.920]  at the bottom of the music app where where you have a little airplay picker and it shows you
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:57.920]  the the destination name right on top of it so it'll say you know marco's airpods or if you're
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:03.120]  if you're playing to an airplay thing called kitchen it'll just say kitchen if the apple music
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:08.720]  app just says kitchen it's doing handoff mode if you use a shortcut to say set playback destination
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:15.280]  to something else that instead of saying kitchen it will say iphone arrow to the right kitchen
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:21.440]  and when you see that that's when you know you're in the streaming mode that it's not doing handoff
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:28.240]  and try that and you will see it is so much faster to connect to disconnect to do anything
[02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:33.840]  it's so much more reliable and so all i want is a checkbox in the home pod settings to always make
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:40.160]  this the behavior so that it will not try to hand off music app playback it will just stream it from
[02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:46.000]  the phone because it is again it's just like airpods auto connection where it's like it's it's
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.360]  a smart feature that sounds like it's really magical convenient and maybe much of the time it
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:59.120]  is but for so many people like me the 30 of the time it's not what you want is too severe a
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:04.800]  penalty i'd rather have it not try to be smart in those ways and i know apple won't stop trying
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:10.720]  so at least give me a setting to turn it off yeah i was gonna ask how do you how do you do that from
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:15.040]  apple music but it's just by doing the obvious thing and going down to what i think of as always
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.000]  being the airplay picker but in other words it's not always airplay even though that's what i think
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:27.040]  of that that picker is being uh yeah it's it's it's called it's i i mean it's it has its own name
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:31.760]  in the api and stuff it's like you know the the it's like the output route basically right right
[02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:39.600]  yeah i guess that's i guess that's what the icon represents um i get the big picture it's very
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:48.160]  clear i think the thing that makes the uh the home pod 2 so fascinating is it's it's not a
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:53.440]  rethink of the home pod at all right like whatever went wrong with the first home pod
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:07:01.920]  they the people who made home pod 2 are clearly the same people i think i mean they seem to have
[02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:09.680]  the same taste in everything same taste in design physical design uh it's the same basic concept
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:16.480]  right there's nothing other else almost nothing different like if you didn't take it apart and
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:22.960]  look at the insides you'd think it's version 1.1 i think you even said on atp it's like 1.5
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:31.920]  but it is a 2.0 it's like an altogether different interior design and the the people who made it
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:39.120]  are remain clearly remained as convinced as they were with the 1.0 that this is what the product
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:44.960]  should be that it should have one way of connecting which is over the air through airplay
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:53.200]  no line in and i know you know a lot the lack of a line in is is you know uh you know maybe
[02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:58.640]  not even a complaint but just like a geez you know or just a uh a headphone jack input you
[02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:04.080]  know so that you could use a home pod to play the audio from any device you know from the last
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:07.760]  that's a line in oh that's line in all right whatever i don't know what they well but like
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:11.760]  well i mean technically it's slightly different yeah it's basically yeah anyway but no i mean
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.160]  you know the line and also like that's not just a you know nice to have if you're neil
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:22.080]  patel and like headphone jacks it's it's also it it gives you longevity to the product like right
[02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:26.880]  long after the electronics of this product are outdated and they no longer run the latest version
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.640]  of audio os or whatever they're calling it you know or you know try not to call it in public
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:36.800]  you know whatever like long after the technology in it is obsolete it's still a really good speaker
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:43.040]  and it could stand alone and just dumbly play a line source if it had an input and it doesn't
[02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:51.040]  uh i see why they didn't do it though you know and it is it's it's it's not spite it's like an
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:57.040]  aesthetic thing it's the i fact that like i said like there's it gives you no other no options of
[02:08:57.040 --> 02:09:02.640]  how to use it it's just you use it the way it's meant to be used if there's a longevity angle
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:08.640]  perhaps they're thinking i mean it also does lock you in not even longevity wise it certainly
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:16.080]  a hundred percent locks you into the apple ecosystem and there you can certainly surmise
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.520]  maybe there's some amount of product marketing spite for lack of a better word that it's designed
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:29.040]  to only work with it as opposed to air pods are a good example which do work as generic
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:36.720]  bluetooth headphones if you want them to i i really doubt that they sell very many of them
[02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:43.760]  at all that aren't used by people who don't own iphones and other apple products but there's
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:51.120]  certainly a longevity angle there where you could you know a hand-me-down or used pair of air pods
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:55.840]  or something you know can be given to somebody who doesn't even have an iphone and they can use them
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:10:00.160]  but it's a certain you know but that's bluetooth and as much as everybody hates bluetooth and i'm
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:05.120]  probably the people who work on air pods probably hate bluetooth more than anybody i'm guessing they
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:12.080]  hate it more than anybody in the world it is wireless so it fits in the apple aesthetic where
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:20.480]  wires are bad and plugs for wires are bad and should be minimized and being able to make a
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:28.480]  product that only has a power cable is you know aesthetically pleasing in a in a way it's just
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:33.680]  but overall it's just that they they they're very hard to tell apart side by side you know
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:38.560]  the graph or what are they not graphite slate what are they i forget i keep forgetting what they
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:43.600]  called the black one because it looks black it is now it's midnight right midnight midnight
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:49.040]  midnight that's the color right but of all of the it's so weird that they keep calling everything
[02:10:49.040 --> 02:10:56.640]  midnight in 2022 because some of the midnight things look oh very blue that's not black right
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:04.560]  like the macbook air with the m2 is definitely not black it is a bluish dark color it is a
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:12.800]  decided blue some of the apple watch straps that are called midnight are definitely blue
[02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:19.600]  definitely blue but others like like the the leather link bracelet that i convinced you to
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:25.520]  buy one of i don't know which color you got which color leather link did you buy i got ink which is
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.280]  which is a like mostly it's it's a pretty dark blue but oh you would not confuse it for black
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:38.000]  all right but that's so they that's that's why yeah but it's it's very slightly blue this home
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:44.320]  pod which ones did you get you get you're a white family you said right yeah yeah yeah so i have
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:50.640]  what apple sent me was one uh midnight and one white so i could see them both the side by side
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:57.840]  with my old black one you can see it in most light but like at night time you can't even see
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:03.440]  the difference you can get right up next to it and you just it is so close to black and i have
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:08.640]  no idea why they why they did this i mean but that's that's app it's like the most appley of
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:17.360]  apple things um so it's the same two colors effectively um the same basic concept with
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:27.200]  what's the thing on the top is it a screen nope it's just a swirly serie looking diffused whatever
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:35.760]  you want to call that thing and you know they added hard hard painted hard screen printed plus
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:43.600]  minus buttons for the volume which is a nice change and a nice concession against the visual
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:50.560]  purity of it you know yeah you know it's actually useful yeah yeah well and we can argue you know
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:13:00.320]  and who knows it's a mystery you know but it it fits with the pre johnny i've post johnny i've
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:08.240]  you know return of a couple more ports put some sd card slots in the expensive macbook pros
[02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:14.960]  sort of you know the relaxed putting an actual plus and minus who knows if johnny i've had
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:21.200]  anything to do with not putting plus and minus on there but it's you know it's funny how all of
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:29.920]  these subtle little changes like the old home pod didn't have plus and minus screen printed onto the
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:40.480]  hardware on top and the new one does and that one was in the johnny i've era and this one is clearly
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:47.280]  post johnny i've all of those changes have happened in one direction right there's not
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:55.200]  a single apple product that has gone the other way and has less things printed on it and fewer
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:02.480]  fewer ports so i i you know i i you know i i think it's probably true that some of those things you
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:08.400]  know johnny i've was obviously very influential there you know it's a little less johnny ivy but
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:16.080]  i mean it is like 99 physically identical i think the to me the acoustics i mean would you at least
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:22.000]  agree they're very similar i mean you yeah you hear a difference but it's it's it would you
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:28.560]  put it this way it's designed by people with the same acoustic taste yes and and and so you know
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:34.080]  the bass got weaker and the only the other like large difference in the sound quality
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:43.120]  relatively is that the the mid-range and and treble ranges are substantially smoother and
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.280]  nicer and clearer with less distortion and and just kind of nicer responses so vocals sound
[02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:56.800]  really nice very smooth very clear you know it's it's a very good sounding speaker like you can
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:03.600]  spend a lot more and get speakers that don't sound nearly this good for vocals yeah i think that the
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:13.120]  acoustic taste of the of the home pod team is very similar in spirit to the photographic taste of
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:21.440]  apple's camera team for the iphone where they value looking like reality you know and sort of
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:27.120]  newt you know good high quality quality of course being the most important thing but without
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:34.720]  exaggerating and also maybe even better than the camera team would be their screen team and the
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:42.240]  way that they calibrate the colors for their displays you don't see it as much anymore because
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:48.160]  i think display technology is sort of coalesced around very high quality oled displays that all
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:55.920]  phone makers can have but like you know like 10 years ago eight years ago there were high-end
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:02.640]  you know like samsung phones you know their biggest competitor high-end high quality android
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:09.440]  phones where the colors were punchier on the displays and you know and apple just doesn't
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:15.840]  like that people who work at apple value you know we're not trying to wow you with this you know the
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:24.240]  emphasizing the trouble in the base right right what's that called the the u curve or that
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:30.880]  smile curve yeah the smile yeah yeah yeah the smile curve um where you pump up the extremes
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.880]  and it is exciting and it's the sort of thing like pumping up the extremes is what you might want to
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:44.320]  do in the entrance way of like a theme park ride where it's like you come in and it's like you just
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:50.400]  want like boom wow exciting and you've got like 33 minutes to wait before you get into the cart
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:57.680]  and go on the ride but it's to me not definitely not what you want for like two hours of a movie
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:04.080]  or you know a you know hours of working while you listen to music you know you want it to mean
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:10.720]  and again that's not it's not like boring it's just also not exaggerated and i think the acoustic
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:17.840]  their acoustic take is like that too um i agree i think it sounds good i think the siri response
[02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:23.360]  time is noticeably better which was my biggest complaint about the old ones and now it's
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:30.880]  my super biggest complaint because i'm used to these um and i just the only other thing i don't
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:37.120]  know i like what the hell happened with the original home pod right what what explains this
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:44.720]  two-year discontinuity in availability it's not the most important mystery or curiosity about
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:52.560]  apple as a company but it's to me one one of the most inexplicable like i've if i have any gifts
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:59.280]  as a pundit it's that i'm often i think pretty good at explaining things that apple itself
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:06.400]  doesn't want to explain you know i think people read me and listen to the show because i i i'm
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:13.120]  pretty good at figuring that out um i for the life of me can't figure out what the hell happened to
[02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:21.600]  the original home pod my best guess and i have no little birdies who've told me this none so this is
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:30.080]  totally my imagination the only way i the only thing i can think of is that there was some sort
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:40.080]  of disastrous hardware failure problem with the original design that they did not foresee
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:47.520]  and did not pick up in in pre-production something that perhaps only manifested itself
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:54.720]  in actual production right which can be as anybody who knows what has deals with the word production
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:01.360]  in whatever you do whether it's hardware or software going to productions sometimes reveals
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:11.280]  problems most famously i can think of would be the white iphone 4 was it or was it the first
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:17.120]  white one the well but they had a well they had a white 3gs right but that was just plastic it
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:24.640]  was the white that was different yeah yeah the white iphone 4 was announced and came out 10
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:33.840]  months late i mean bananas that they announced it in june and it didn't come out until like
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:39.600]  april of the next year apparently because when they went into production it was like yellowing
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:45.280]  or something like that really really weird my favorite side note about that i think it was
[02:19:46.240 --> 02:19:53.200]  yeah i think it was that in the iphone 4 was the antenna gate phone right uh yes yeah so my funny
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:59.760]  story about that is they announced this phone in june in white and black and they take pre-orders
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:02.720]  blah blah blah and then they're like well the white one's going to be delayed and they don't
[02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:06.960]  want to say how much and the black one comes out and then this antenna gate thing happens
[02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:14.240]  i forget what date when the antenna gate thing was maybe i can look it up i'm gonna guess it was
[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:21.280]  august um so you know like six weeks after the phone came out but the white one is still not
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:27.920]  available i go out to apple for the antenna gate press conference and it's on apple's campus and
[02:20:28.880 --> 02:20:33.520]  they're guiding us in the press you're not like free of course not free to just wander around but
[02:20:34.080 --> 02:20:38.640]  the way apple's infinite loop campus was set up you certainly get to do see apple employees
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.400]  and there were white iphone 4s everywhere like employees had them and it's like whoa that is
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:50.080]  weird and but it had been announced it was supposed to be on sale but they were there
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:55.760]  but you know obviously something went wrong in production there something like this is my guess
[02:20:55.760 --> 02:21:02.320]  something like that was wrong with the original home pod design and it they didn't foresee it
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:08.720]  there are reports you know and you had some that got flaky and never got unflaky but there are
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:13.520]  other people i've seen who've had reports of ones that just stopped playing audio and stuff right i
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.960]  think they they added they were actually they were pretty widespread reports of certain electrical
[02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:24.160]  components like slowly frying themselves inside right there there was something there that was
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:29.440]  wrong i don't think that's what happened to me because i didn't have the same symptoms as those
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:34.720]  so i don't think that was a problem with my other with my my main pair of home pod ones but but uh
[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:40.480]  certainly uh i had other problems just slowly flaking out but you know it was hard for me to
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:47.200]  tell with mine whether they were flaking out in some kind of hardware flaw way or whether they
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:52.960]  were just slow and buggy which they always were so you know it's a little hard and you know the
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:59.600]  new home pods are fast and buggy um so it's hard to tell like you know what's what's the real fault
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:07.040]  here yeah uh something like that and that that it wasn't fixable with like a tweak and that they
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:15.280]  engineering wise weren't prepared at all to do to have a 2.0 ready to go and you know studied it
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:19.760]  and when they ran you know everybody one of the famous things about the home pod was that
[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:23.840]  people could tell from the production numbers that they were all from like the original batch
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:28.960]  you know that they never really made more they sold the ones they had and stopped making them
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:36.400]  and and that the the team was already newfound you know once they found the problem was heads down
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.160]  you know working as fast as they could to make one that didn't have a new design that didn't
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:52.000]  have a problem and this is how long that takes you know it's that something like two years is
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:57.040]  how long it takes to go from okay let's start all over and make an all new design that doesn't have
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:23:03.840]  this problem but that is exact is still the this is the design it's this is still the product we
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:09.840]  want to make we want this product we think this is the way home pod should be that it takes two
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:14.720]  years and that they didn't want to keep making the old one with the problem maybe it was they
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:20.720]  were losing money on them with the failure rate i don't i don't know i i guess because they were
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:24.320]  many of them were still under warranty and were getting replaced um you know by having
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:28.560]  whatever the blown capacitor or whatever the problem was they were doing a lot of replacements
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:34.000]  yeah uh i mean but i think it's important too like you know you just said like they
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:41.840]  they didn't change the product much like they it's still a 300 ish you know like they technically
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:47.280]  they they lowered the price from 350 to 300 but for most of the lifetime of the first one you
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:51.840]  could always get it for 300 from like best buy or whatever like they they would they were clearly
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:56.320]  doing like a kind of you know out the back discount to certain preferred partners because
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:00.720]  that was that was like the price it was actually selling better so that was effectively the price
[02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:06.000]  it was for most of its life um and that's not a huge price difference anyway 350 versus 300 it's
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.400]  still a premium priced speaker you know it's still way more than an amazon echo and the google
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:16.560]  whatever's and so you know so obviously they decided price wasn't a problem and also again
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:21.520]  the existence of the home pod mini also changes things in the sense that you know they're when
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:26.160]  it's not the only product in the home pod lineup and there is one that is way less expensive you
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:30.640]  know the home pod mini is 100 bucks uh which i think is by the way i think that's one of the
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:35.520]  best values in apple's entire lineup um but you know when when you have one that's 100 bucks it
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.880]  takes a lot of the pricing pressure off the 300 one but regardless they clearly said okay you
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.480]  know what price price obviously wasn't the problem so they didn't cancel the old one for price
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.160]  they didn't cancel it because it didn't have a line in because the new one doesn't have a line
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:57.840]  in either right um you know it did apparently lacking bluetooth also didn't hurt it nope or
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:04.080]  lacking lacking lacking a real screen on top that you know shows like a user interface that wasn't
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:09.200]  it it's it's the same freaking product i mean yeah a normal did the same thing with minor
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:14.640]  modifications yeah i mean a normal person most people if you put them side by side with the two
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:19.120]  of them you know and not quite side by side but one on one side of the room on one on the other
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:23.200]  side of the room would have a really hard time it'd be like one of those puzzles what's the
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:27.440]  difference between these two drawings they they would you know they would think they sound the
[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:31.920]  same they work the same they have all the same features it's the same thing but there was a
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:39.680]  nearly two-year discontinuity in availability and and apple being apple left those of us who
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:46.960]  loved the original home pod worried non-stop until they announced the damn thing that we'd
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:53.760]  never have one again i mean and i was about to say her name but i'll just say somebody in the house
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:59.760]  has given me a hard time about the fact that i've squirreled away squirreled away two more
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:09.040]  just in case because i was really worried that one of mine would blow and i wanted to replace
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:13.280]  it and i didn't think they'd ever make it again uh here's an update i got an update from the
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:20.320]  control booth they say uh the uh antenna gate press conference was july 16 so it was only a
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.480]  few weeks after the iphone 4 had shipped but uh right because the phone came out like probably
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.760]  in june right right right but still i also thought in hindsight that makes sense because i remember
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:35.440]  thinking as i saw apple employees with white iphone 4s walking around i remember thinking
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:41.520]  that uh it was a clue that the they you know whatever was wrong it would soon be unronged
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:49.280]  and they'd come out soon wrong yeah yeah you were only off by like seven months yeah but anyway the
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.880]  only other thing about the home pods that i i emphasize when i write about them is and i don't
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:02.240]  know how i you know i'm not jaws i'm not phil uh you know and i wouldn't be good in their jobs i'm
[02:27:02.240 --> 02:27:10.320]  not a marketing person i but so maybe i'm wrong about it but i it frustrates me because i think
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:18.880]  the true home pod experience is the 600 pair of two and it's great that you can spend 300 and
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:26.000]  just get one and if you're in a dorm room that might be all you need and if you're on the college
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:33.760]  budget that might be much more amenable to your budget um it's great that one of them sounds as
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:42.880]  good as it does and fills a room as well as it does but two of them are so much better than two
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:50.560]  times better than one so much better i mean i i i don't know they're like two home pods are like
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:57.280]  to me five times better than one home pod in terms of the audio quality because it takes two of them
[02:27:57.280 --> 02:28:04.640]  to do the computational magic of making it sound like some sound is coming from places where there
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:11.520]  isn't a home pod when you only play one the direction it there's no way to fake it you can
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:16.800]  close your eyes and you can tell exactly where that one home pod is in a room when you've got
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:24.400]  two paired and you close your eyes you and you're listening to a modern song with spatial audio or
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:31.520]  modern mixed movies and prestige tv shows you you really cannot believe that the sound is only
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:38.080]  coming from those two sources and it's it's it's so much better than two times better and i i just
[02:28:38.080 --> 02:28:45.440]  don't think apple markets it that way at all i really and therefore i think people miss out on
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:54.560]  it and i really think that people think that buying two is spending 600 on a smart assistant
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:29:00.960]  which seems ridiculous whereas what i think and i really again i'm not an audiophile but
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.440]  just as someone who just wants the shows and movies i watch to sound good and to have my
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:13.040]  the music in my kitchen sound good um 600 as theater home theater equipment is a
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:21.120]  bargain a bargain compared to what you would get from bows or bang and oliveson or or sony even
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:27.920]  and you have no wires clattering and stuff like that it it's a bargain and i i think
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:34.560]  the lack of marketing and apple's reputation for selling stuff that's more expensive than
[02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:42.000]  the comparable product categories from any other company just has it's just a complete blind spot
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:48.960]  to anybody who might otherwise urge or i would just say should just spend 600 on two home pods
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:56.240]  and save hundreds and hundreds of dollars versus the equivalent audio experience for with other
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:04.880]  equipment yeah it it really is extremely competitive uh in in that in that space with me
[02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.120]  when you have two of them and yeah you're right comparing to any kind of home theater setup like
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:13.760]  yeah you know a full-blown home theater setup can fill larger rooms better you can get you know true
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:18.560]  surround and everything that's all true but yeah you're going to be way past 600 bucks to you know
[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:24.080]  for for something that sounds anywhere near this good um but yeah like i i think you know the
[02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:30.720]  the huge advantage it has when you have a stereo pair is it just fills the space better you know
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:37.120]  that it's very very hard with just physics to have one speaker in the middle of the space fill that
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:41.600]  space with sound it's always going to sound like it's coming from that one point you know they they
[02:30:41.600 --> 02:30:45.760]  can play tricks with oh we're going to bounce some of it off this wall or whatever and that works a
[02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:51.600]  little bit but it doesn't make a huge difference it's a stereo pair always sounds better in in
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:56.560]  every case like it's it's always sounds better and to the point where like i wish they would
[02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:02.800]  sell like a bundle of two for some yes small discount you know right even if it's only like
[02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:08.480]  50 bucks like whatever the discount would be some small discount to sell a bundle of two just to
[02:31:08.480 --> 02:31:13.920]  give people the idea maybe i should consider buying two of these yeah yep that's exact i
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:18.080]  think that would make such a big difference even if they didn't discount it even if it was still
[02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:24.560]  600 bucks but it was called home pods and and just but two at once i think in hindsight too
[02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:30.400]  maybe something something to do with the way that this has worked out in the market is maybe
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:35.600]  if they could do it all over again they should have shipped the home pod minis first and called
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:41.840]  them home pods and said this is a home pod and you can talk to it and it sounds great and look
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:49.520]  how tiny and acute and adorable it is and then come out with the home pod plus the home pod ultra
[02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:56.480]  max you know i don't know which which of their max ultra yeah home pad pro max ultra um
[02:31:56.480 --> 02:32:06.480]  pro max ultra um and you know and and get you in the door with the uh i'm i'm i'm you know i
[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:11.760]  don't want to spend more than 100 bucks on you know the one of these things and okay i'll buy
[02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:17.520]  this one and then oh man i really like this but boy i wish it sounded bigger and richer you know
[02:32:17.520 --> 02:32:23.840]  maybe uh maybe they've you know they've mixed up calling this one the normal one and the other one
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:29.840]  the mini and should have called the other one the normal one and this one the max or whatever they
[02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:36.480]  would call it i don't know i again i'm apple's naming is a black magic and it they've certainly
[02:32:36.480 --> 02:32:42.400]  been successful with it as as confusing as it is to us who love to analyze it and nitpick it
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:47.680]  it's obviously been successful so maybe not but i can't help but think that that would help emphasize
[02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:53.280]  how good the product is right because that's the other thing if they called it the home pod ultra
[02:32:53.840 --> 02:33:01.520]  it would emphasize this thing sounds surprisingly good anyway um let me take a break here thank our
[02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:07.920]  third our final sponsor of the show our good friends at memberful uh look memberful has a
[02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:13.440]  world-class support team that is ready to help you a creator simplify your memberships and grow your

[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:38.720]  ownership of your audience and your brand it doesn't your your members don't go through a
[02:33:38.720 --> 02:33:45.200]  thing that makes it sound like they're signing up for memberful and then as a subcategory picking
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:52.160]  you no it's it's not that sort of thing at all like sub stack right where you're like a sub stack
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:59.040]  and now you're in sub stack and then which one are you in with memberful your brand is the primary

[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:25.120]  thing i know we've already talked a long time probably not a record for you and me but no just
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:31.760]  to wrap it up out of the blue your last episode of atp let's let's do an atp follow-up here you
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:40.960]  drove a friend's rivian yep and uh i drove a rivian and i never wrote about it i have uh
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.320]  somebody who uh andy a guy named andy bowman who used to work at apple pr
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:54.400]  what left apple for rivian because it this is a really interesting idea to have an electric
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:04.480]  vehicle company making a really groundbreaking electric vehicles and to have a professional
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:15.920]  press team for pr so that they could deal with the media i mean it's a revolutionary
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:17.440]  idea i i i've
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:27.760]  i think perhaps other electric car companies should consider having uh pr professionals
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:35.120]  handle press yeah you know you could you can maybe say that you might be some benefits there
[02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:39.520]  yeah i mean i could think in numerous ways that it might help and that may be you know
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:45.600]  uh hiring professionals but through because i'm not known obviously i am not known for my
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.760]  reviews of cars or electric vehicles but i got through there was a they had a media thing in
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:57.920]  new york i think it was last summer there's a brooklyn you probably didn't even know where it
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:02.560]  is if you're even considering it but there's a rivian dealership in brooklyn and that you know
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:07.520]  they have like a big garage where they can do service and stuff like that and i got to take
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:14.240]  an extensive test drive i forget how long it was but it started in brooklyn went through manhattan
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:23.200]  and we got out on the highway um and i was i didn't write about it because again i often
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.440]  have these things i want to write about and get stuck trying to do it and they're stuck in my
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:37.680]  head but i was floored by how great the experience was driving the rivian i've driven briefly more
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:44.720]  briefly electric vehicles before and i get the x you know how different the acceleration curve is
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:52.800]  on an electric motor for how much better in every way it is than it with a gas engine but what wowed
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:39:01.520]  me the most was the what's it called regenerative braking yeah it's very strong in the rivian right
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:06.000]  so for people who haven't done this i mean i probably have a lot of listeners who have
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:14.000]  electric cars but i knew about it but basically when you take your foot off the gas it doesn't
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:20.560]  coast like a gas car it starts braking and that braking is taking the momentum of the car to
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:27.280]  recharge the the battery is that i mean basically it's it's sort of yeah like it's instead of
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:31.200]  actually applying the brakes because you know i mean you know when you hit the brake pedal it
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:36.320]  applies the brakes of course but when you just let off the gas the car will engage effectively
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:42.400]  a generator right and it'll take some of the energy from the wheels to turn a generator which
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:47.840]  which causes resistance and slows the car down right and you're converting that the momentum
[02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:53.360]  the car had you're converting some of that back into generated electricity for the battery so
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.640]  what they told me was we took off and they explained this to me and you know um and they
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.640]  you know showed me all sorts of other things about the the the the truck i guess i don't
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:09.280]  keep wanting to call it a car i drove the one i guess it was the pickup truck one what's that one
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:17.840]  called um the r1t r1t but it's the same basically the same vehicle as the suv it's just what shape
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:25.840]  the rear has it's the same cockpit same cabin same interface same engine but they explained
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:32.480]  this to me and said once you get used to it you won't need to use the brake for most part even
[02:40:32.480 --> 02:40:39.040]  as you drive like through brooklyn which it you know or manhattan right where the sort of city
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:46.800]  driving where even if you're not gas pedal happy it's you know lots of gas lots of braking lots of
[02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:52.480]  gas lots of braking gas brake gas brake and i've been driving for a long time and i do like to
[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:57.280]  drive a little fast although i don't drive fast in the city i and they said it'll take a little
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:01.840]  bit time to get used to but you'll get used to it and when you do you won't need the break even
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:07.680]  as you drive through the city and i just uh you know i was like okay i'll you know i i hear the
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:12.400]  words you're saying but once i started driving i couldn't help but put my foot on the brake but you
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:22.640]  know then i got i was like okay okay and then it's like this is amazing that it's it is so pleasant
[02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:31.040]  to drive through stop and go city traffic like this it is amazing and it's suck of all the things
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:38.880]  i thought i might prefer about a electric car compared to my gas car experience i didn't that
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:46.320]  wasn't even on my list and it's after one like two-hour experience driving a rivian it was by
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:53.840]  far and away my favorite thing about it by far it's amazing it it and if every car had always
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:58.240]  worked like that and somebody invented a car all the other ways that you wouldn't invent a gas
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:05.360]  powered car you know after everybody was used to electric but the way that gas-powered cars don't
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.800]  do that and you take your foot off the gas and they just keep going no one would ever do that
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:17.200]  it would be yeah it is the i it's one of those things you have to experience to drive it and
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:23.440]  it didn't again i only had like a 90 minute or two hour two hour tops test drive but i got so
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:29.280]  used to it and then you know we shook hands and i thank them for their time and they answer all
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:33.840]  my questions and then i got back on a train and came home and i'm on the train coming home to
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:38.000]  philly and i'm thinking oh my god am i going to kill somebody as i get back in my acura
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:43.760]  because i'm just going to take am i already used to this i'm just going to take my foot off the
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.960]  gas and just smash into the back of the car in front of me because i thought i might already be
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:56.960]  broken i wasn't but um it's a very different way of driving it really is like like you know i i
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:04.240]  drove a tesla model s for oh geez six seven years something like that and one of the characteristics
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:08.560]  of that is like it it has pretty strong region not as strong as the rubian pretty pretty strong
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:14.400]  region breaking when you when you let off the accelerator except if the battery is like 100
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:20.480]  charged or 99 charged or or if i think it's extremely cold like if you go like in the middle
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:24.800]  of the winter like if during certain conditions the regenerative braking doesn't function
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:31.440]  um and so i would occasionally have times where i would drive my car and it wouldn't do the region
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.840]  braking and you you let off the gas you're like oh my god why am i still going like it's just
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:40.560]  and it's all it's doing is acting like a gas car at that point which i drove for you know over a
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.960]  decade before that and it was fine because that's what i was used to but once you are used to that
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:49.760]  feeling it's really disorienting like you know and i i have since had to go back to a gas car
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:54.640]  because my rubian reservation is not in yet and i had to go somewhere off road so i had i had to buy
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:44:01.840]  a um a land river defender uh for our beach access here and it you know it's just it's a regular gas
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:07.840]  car and going back to gas that was the most jarring thing about it besides the fact that
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.480]  you know you step on the gas nothing happens for a few seconds and the gear changes and you know
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:16.960]  the having to actually get gas which is horrific and you know terrible when you're when you haven't
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:22.640]  done it for seven years like oh wow gas stations are stinky and inconvenient and you know not to
[02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:27.440]  mention terrible for the environment and the cleanest ruby and get please hurry up on my
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:32.880]  reservation i've been waiting a long time the cleanest but yeah the cleanest gas station you
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:40.000]  go to is filthy i mean it's exactly because it's just full of cars which are filthy and gasoline
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.480]  which is filthy liquid and you know like i i love like there have been a couple of really good
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.080]  essays written over the last few years um written from the point of view of someone who is a
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:56.480]  customer to electric cars describing the weirdness of gas cars because you know and they're like
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:44:59.840]  they're like satires of like you know people write these articles about like well you know
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:04.240]  with electric cars you have to worry about your range and you can't just get gas anywhere and so
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:08.720]  there's you know there's a few great essays i'll try to find someone sending the links um there
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:14.400]  was a good one recently that went around mastodon uh where like you know people people talking about
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:18.480]  how weird gas cars are once you're accustomed to electric and there's you know multiple things
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:23.040]  about that one of which is like yeah when you're slowing down to stop the gas car just wastes all
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:27.120]  the all the momentum you have like you just don't get to recapture it you can't convert it back to
[02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:34.800]  gas um also like one of the one of the greatest convenience additions when you get an electric
[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:38.880]  car is something you don't think about you know before you get your first electric car all you're
[02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:42.080]  thinking about is range and you're thinking about those long highway trips when you're going to have
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.680]  to stop at a charger somewhere and you're worried about that and that's understandable to be worried
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:50.560]  about because it's unfamiliar to you i was too before i got the first tesla i was very worried
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:56.000]  about that um and then when i got the tesla i realized that's pretty well handled you know by
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.320]  fast charging stations along highways and stuff that's that's actually not a big concern and the
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:06.800]  other side of that is because most of the time you're plugging in at your house you are leaving
[02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:13.360]  the house every day with a full tank all the time right yeah so all the the rest of the year when
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:19.040]  you're not taking long highway trips to go somewhere you never have to stop anywhere so you
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.600]  never have like you know now that i'm back on gas for hopefully a short time please get my reservation
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:28.000]  and soon we're being pleased now that i'm back on gas for whatever time this is gonna end up being
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:34.640]  i have to keep going to get gas and so every so often i'll have to like take 10 minutes out of my
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.760]  trip or you know whatever and go stop somewhere and go to these special stinky places and get gas
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:46.400]  whereas it when you drive electric you are almost never having to stop because you're charging at
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:50.320]  home so every day you're leaving with a full tank maybe you can even plug in at work or wherever
[02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:56.160]  you're like so there's you're always you're always charged so you only have to think about range when
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:00.720]  you're going on those occasional very long you know multi-hour driving trips the whole rest of
[02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:06.000]  your life you're just always full it's incredible and so when you go back to gas and be like you can
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:11.360]  only get gas at these certain places none of which are your house and it's it's a very different
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:18.240]  experience and yes gas is more convenient on those long trips but all the rest of your life electric
[02:47:18.240 --> 02:47:26.720]  is so much more convenient i was super impressed with rivian's build quality and design choices
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:33.120]  usually every time i read in my experience driving unfamiliar cars is rentals and you
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:38.080]  know i'm always every time i rent a car it's it's you know you almost never get the same one
[02:47:38.080 --> 02:47:43.840]  same model twice or even vaguely so and i'm instantly of course surprise surprise very
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:49.040]  picky and upset about certain choices of where certain controls are and which sticks are where
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:55.120]  and what even what font they used for this and that instantly i have never sat behind a steering
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:59.760]  wheel for the first time and thought boy that's in the right spot that's in the right spot i like
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:07.280]  where they put that never ever more than with rivian and again it's like if you stick with the
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:14.720]  same brand and you buy you know an acura after an acura or a honda accord after a honda accord
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:19.040]  there's a or if you shift from a honda accord to a honda
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:28.000]  suv the controls you know there's a brand similarity there or if you stick within bmw
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.680]  you know you don't get you don't get confused about where controls are but rivian doesn't have
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:38.560]  any heritage like that they're not derived from any other thing and it's not at all like the
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:44.640]  accurate that i'm used to but i i i have never sat behind the cockpit and thought this this is
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:51.200]  really well arranged and nothing annoyed me as much it and just all the little things and there's
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.480]  so many little things that i personally do not like about tesla's that i feel i think feel cheap
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:02.560]  or i think feel poorly designed i can't stand their freaking door handles i just can't i
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:06.080]  honest to god they've made they've never made a good door handle never made a good door i've
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:09.600]  never seen it and they're all and they're all bad in different ways and they're all bad in
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.200]  different ways and then they've gotten worse and to me i don't know that i can i honestly it it's
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:22.240]  in the way uh you know this about me and my taste on watches i could never buy a wrist watch that
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:29.440]  has any any bit of typography on the dial or the back of the case the back of the case that
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:34.960]  i disagree with there have been watches i've almost bought where the on the back of the case
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:40.400]  there's like you know assembled in switzerland or whatever is in it they typeset it in ariel
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:45.840]  and i i therefore i will not buy nope it's out i will not buy it and put it on my wrist
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.120]  to me the tesla door handles might be like that i don't know but i i just think the build quality
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:59.200]  is better i think tesla's interiors have a you know a mid-range you know honda toyota sort of
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:10.400]  quality to them and the rivian is the lexus acura even bmw i honestly i it's a re it's just
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:17.040]  great great interior i i'm just blown away by it from a new company that and you guys covered this
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:27.040]  on atp the big sticking point for nerds is that like tesla their computer stack is all their own
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:34.320]  and so they don't support airplay or not airplay carplay so it's their maps it's their stuff i
[02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:40.160]  mean you can obviously connect your phone to play music yeah it has bluetooth right it has bluetooth
[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:47.280]  i don't know how i feel about that but you you seem having used both recently to be not
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:55.040]  surprised to me surprisingly not that mindful of not just because you owned a tesla for a long time
[02:50:55.040 --> 02:51:01.040]  but you know having driven this land rover now for a while that does have carplay and you're
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:07.680]  literally a carplay developer i mean i mean car plays carplay support is a very significant part
[02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:15.760]  of making uh an ios podcast app i mean well that's the thing it actually isn't because you know the
[02:51:15.760 --> 02:51:21.120]  the way carplay is implemented for developers like me who are not apple um they you basically have
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:26.080]  like you can choose from certain templates the different screens will use and you can you kind
[02:51:26.080 --> 02:51:31.280]  of like give it you know structured data to say okay well you know show show the list template
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:35.360]  and then show these cells with these things in them and here's title and artwork for each one
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:40.160]  but you don't have a ton of control over all those little details you don't have a ton of options you
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:46.080]  don't have you can't do a full complete ui it gets limited in many ways like for instance the the
[02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:52.720]  length of lists is limited by certain jurisdictions for regulation reasons so like sometimes you only
[02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:57.120]  see like the first 12 items in a list and it'll cut it off like there's a whole bunch of limitations
[02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:02.400]  like that and and of course there's rules also like you you aren't allowed to use the carplay
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:06.960]  interface elements to make some kind of game like you can't like you can't make a carplay game
[02:52:06.960 --> 02:52:11.360]  basically by you know whatever you do with the list you can't make like a you know a card flipping
[02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.280]  game or pseudo or whatever else like you you could that you could technically make one but it's
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:20.640]  disallowed by the rules um but anyway so carplay is a very limited uh environment for developers
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:25.520]  to really do much what you're doing is pretty basic there yeah and so i i was fine you know i
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:31.120]  i've only had a carplay vehicle myself for the last seven months or whatever and so it's
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:36.560]  been seven months or whatever before that i just had this little carplay test unit on my desk and
[02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:40.800]  that was enough combined with you know user feedback that was enough for me to develop it
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:48.320]  but you know for the rivian not having carplay again it's it's something that i would like to
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:52.480]  have it as an option i hope they add it they could add it via software if they wanted to
[02:52:52.480 --> 02:53:00.880]  as far as i know so i would love to have carplay as an option but the lack of carplay does is not
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:06.160]  a killer for me to buy the vehicle um why do you think they don't why do you think they don't
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:12.720]  well i i know i always heard that with tesla it was it was very much that kind of like
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:19.680]  the the arrogant engineering culture of we want to own everything which i get to some degree you
[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:26.160]  know i do that myself so you know we want to own everything but also the i think where the main
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:32.320]  difference comes in is you won't need it that's the big that's where like the attitude at tesla
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:37.600]  was always why would you need carplay you have our system and it's so much better and look you
[02:53:37.600 --> 02:53:43.120]  can even play these dumb games in it and and you know so that's and that's you know there's many
[02:53:43.120 --> 02:53:49.280]  problems with tesla that so i get the feeling that rivian it probably has that same degree
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:56.880]  of opinionation if that's a word of like they are they they they're screen design their ui design
[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:03.280]  the whole the whole way their center console screen works the design is very much uh in the
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:08.720]  in the realm of what tesla strives to be i think rivian does a better job of it uh frankly and i
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:14.480]  and i think you know the experience of being a tesla owner is you get an amazingly driving car
[02:54:14.480 --> 02:54:21.600]  with some really great amazing features and there's a bunch of kind of quirks that you have
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:27.040]  to tolerate in order to access those features for instance the door handles having to access your
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:33.360]  car but also you know the the the design of the screen you know they they they'll send out over
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:37.840]  the air redesigns at the drop of a hat and all of a sudden you'll get into your car and you can't
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:43.520]  find the defroster um and and they they have mixed success with tesla over the years they
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:48.960]  some of their uis are okay some of them are terrible some of them are great you know but
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:52.560]  for the most part with tesla you're rolling the dice constantly and they're all over the map
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:59.440]  rivian so far seems to be much more disciplined with their design and much more successful with
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:07.280]  it and they rivian seems to have the the confidence to not attempt things like stupid door handles
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:13.760]  because you know tesla is is desperate to prove to the world how innovative they are right look
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.280]  well look how different their trucks look right so the best comparison is the rivian both trucks
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:26.960]  versus the cyber truck which honest to god i i think it's hard to believe is not a i still
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:32.560]  think it's hard to believe is not a prank and i know well until it's out we don't really know
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.240]  that right but those those real world pictures that somebody snapped recently of of a of a
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:44.400]  cyber truck on the street where it's not photographed by tesla's photographers in a
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:52.480]  product product marketing scenario but just real world on the street the sheets of what is it it
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:59.280]  is stainless steel is i believe so yeah that they're all warped in a way that you would think
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:07.360]  they were it looks it looks like it looks like a fantastic senior college student product project
[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:13.200]  from the university of michigan where these budding car engineers built this thing right it
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:20.000]  doesn't look like a premium truck i i know some people out there seem to love it but to me it's
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:27.200]  it's to me the people who seem to love it are these elon musk fanatics who who also seem to
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.120]  think he's doing insist he's doing a good job running twitter um yeah right i don't know but
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:40.400]  i mean in terms of a few years ago like i i this is pre-pandemic um during one of our california
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:45.840]  trips for an apple thing um i had the opportunity to visit the facebook campus and i'd never been
[02:56:45.840 --> 02:56:53.360]  there before and overall i the feeling i got from the facebook campus was a i don't belong here
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:57:01.040]  and b i find it almost creepy in a lot of ways like it was a very young people who really thought
[02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:08.960]  a lot of themselves um doing things in in ways that seemed a little bit immature um and a little
[02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:14.400]  bit you know unwise maybe um you know kind of making this weird fantasy world where everything
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:18.560]  they did was great and but they were always like weird undercurrents of like well if you actually
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:24.480]  you know use the baseball shop on campus you'll be fired for not working hard enough or whatever
[02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:28.800]  like there's all sorts it's it was a weird vibe and then that i think it was that same day or
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:33.040]  at least it was that same trip i also got a chance to visit the apple campus that was back
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:41.760]  in infinite loop and i remember the the vibe was so different it it was striking these two such
[02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:46.640]  different places such different cultures and you looked around the apple campus and it was very
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.280]  clear like oh this is where the grown-ups work like this is like you go to the facebook campus
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:56.320]  when you want like when you want what you think of your college life whatever you think that is you
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:00.320]  want that to last forever or you think it always will last forever or you think that's the best
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:05.680]  it'll ever be or whatever that's what facebook is is for and then when you you know when you
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:10.080]  those people who don't want that and who just want like a nice grown-up job where you do good work
[02:58:10.080 --> 02:58:14.560]  and then you go home at night that's apple right that's the feeling i got whether that's actually
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:19.520]  true i don't know but the feeling i got visiting those two campuses that's what it was like and to
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:24.960]  me being a tesla owner for so long i think it's much more like the facebook culture where it's
[02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:33.200]  like it you know move fast break things surely to to a fault and you know and everyone's like
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:38.720]  trying like you know these big moonshot kind of ideas trying to prove that they're innovative and
[02:58:38.720 --> 02:58:43.600]  and and the thing is they are innovative they don't need to prove it by things like dumb door
[02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:49.120]  handles and weird ui designs like they don't need to do those things the cars themselves without
[02:58:49.120 --> 02:58:55.360]  those things even if they had regular boring door handles are very innovative rivian seems like
[02:58:55.360 --> 02:59:00.480]  they are much more confident that their cars are good and they and rivians are very innovative in
[02:59:00.480 --> 02:59:06.160]  lots of other ways some some of their like useful utility features and you know the more like
[02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:11.200]  adventure you know camping features the utility features like even stupid things like their roof
[02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:17.280]  rack their their roof crossbars super innovative like the way you can just pop them on pop them
[02:59:17.280 --> 02:59:21.760]  off you can stick them in the front like it's there they have thought of so many little details
[02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:27.520]  of that car it's these cars are extremely innovative from rivian but they don't feel the
[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:32.240]  need to show it off in ways like weird door handles right there because they're you know
[02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:38.080]  quirks of the interior like they they just made a nice car that's really useful and it's it's
[02:59:38.080 --> 02:59:44.720]  designed in a more confident restrained way in in those kind of flashy areas because they know they
[02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:48.800]  don't need to show off there they just made a nice car that works really well and they've thought of
[02:59:48.800 --> 02:59:53.520]  all these details in a very apple-like way you know it's like we've thought of the nice things
[02:59:53.520 --> 02:59:57.760]  we've thought of the nice details it works it has all these little clever features and nice designs
[02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:02.640]  and it won't get in your way and the door handles aren't gonna freeze and they're not gonna you know
[03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:08.480]  fail and all this problems that tesla has yeah i i wouldn't say like if you blindfolded me for
[03:00:08.480 --> 03:00:13.440]  a couple of years and then as you know took me away and then brought me back and put me in a
[03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:19.680]  unmarked unlabeled rivian and said this is the apple car i i don't think i would quite believe
[03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:24.960]  it it's not quite appley but i might believe it right now there's too many buttons for to be
[03:00:24.960 --> 03:00:32.160]  the yeah exactly a good thing right exactly it wouldn't it wouldn't quite pass the sniff test
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:39.520]  for me but it would have me thinking maybe you know i don't know it's it it but there there is
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:46.000]  a similarity and i think it's why they invited me to to drive it it's a similar and again i think
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:50.800]  what you're saying the thing i remember is like i don't want a pickup truck at all if i were to buy
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:56.480]  a rivian i'd buy the other one but some of the things in the bed of the truck that are clever
[03:00:56.480 --> 03:01:03.040]  they're all none of them are clever for cleverness sake they're all have obvious utility in some
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:10.000]  obvious way it's anything that is different or original is different or original in the name of
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:16.640]  a utility an obvious utilitarian purpose that maybe you won't use but you can imagine somebody
[03:01:16.640 --> 03:01:22.240]  would use and and the other the other thing that comes to mind with that and to me is apple like
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:27.440]  like hey what if the door handles were completely normal right and nobody's gonna say anything about
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:40.000]  it is the the mentality that apple has that they they will ship iphones that look to most people
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:50.560]  exactly the same for three four five years maybe right iphone six six s seven eight you know yeah
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:57.760]  all looked exactly the same um and aren't worried they're so confident that this is a good design
[03:01:57.760 --> 03:02:03.520]  and this is good that that they'll just keep selling it for three four years even though
[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:09.200]  that's totally not exciting and not going to get a lot a lot of the tech press is going to ding
[03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:15.200]  them for it immediately like every single iphone that isn't an all new original design a lot of the
[03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:20.320]  reviews immediately ding it because it looks just like last year's phone and they're confident that
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:30.560]  no because this is a good design i i've been told by someone whose name rhymes with johnny i've
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:40.960]  personally um that they will never make a change just to make a change that they will only make
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:49.520]  a change if it they're a hundred percent sure that it's better now there are times where they've made
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:54.400]  changes that i think all of us would agree are not better but they thought someone at apple thought
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:59.040]  it was better someone thought it was better to switch to butterfly keyboard someone thought
[03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:07.440]  it was better overall and the overall balance of things to ship a macbook that only has one usb-c
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:17.680]  port um but that was you know it mistakes are made right nobody's perfect but there's never
[03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:23.280]  any sort of ostentatious we're just going to radically change the shape of the phone every
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:30.480]  year just because we want new new new right it's and rivian to me has that sort of humility
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:36.080]  of we'll show off you know we'll make it nice where we will but i i don't know i it's it's
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:40.560]  a product i haven't spoken about it a lot and i wish i had but i thought having you on recently
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:46.320]  driving i'd bring it up the only other thing i'll mention to you and i it's you know i you're
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:54.320]  probably gonna fucking buy ones knowing you so all right i'm literally waiting to oh no no no i know
[03:03:54.320 --> 03:03:59.680]  i know i know you you're gonna find someone who's selling a used one and you know probably have one
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:06.960]  by the time the show's done editing but if i could i would i know that's i know you um so you'll get
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:12.960]  more experienced with this than me but you i believe you said on atp did not get to take it
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:19.680]  out on the highway that's correct right i did and and dates and i said can i go as fast as i want
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:26.320]  and they said sure and i so i got it in sport mode number one the sport mode on the rivian
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:31.440]  is not like a do-nothing button you know like when you press the the button across the street
[03:04:31.440 --> 03:04:35.920]  you know it's like or or you know yeah the door closed button in an elevator yeah the door closed
[03:04:35.920 --> 03:04:44.800]  button in elevator uh the or or something that just makes noise the sport mode in rivian is like
[03:04:46.640 --> 03:04:53.360]  in the incredibles when mr incredible turns his car into the incredibles car you know it it
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.640]  really does something it lowers it noticeably which i like as someone who'd rather drive a
[03:04:58.640 --> 03:05:07.120]  car than suv and holy shit does it does it change the way that it performs when you go let's say
[03:05:08.080 --> 03:05:12.880]  not that anybody in the state of new york can give me a ticket seven months later let's say
[03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:26.720]  a little north of 100 miles an hour it is it is unbelievable oh it is i i mean honestly i i
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:32.320]  if i could have bought one i might have done it you know but you can't you know on the spot i i
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:38.880]  just thinking i was going for a press test drive i i came back to brooklyn and it was just like i
[03:05:38.880 --> 03:05:45.200]  need to get get one of these and somehow got talked out of it it is well you can't buy them
[03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:50.080]  i know that's the whole problem so well i hope that they succeed because i really like what
[03:05:50.080 --> 03:05:56.480]  they're doing and i like their aesthetic i worry that a company that you know that that there's a
[03:05:56.480 --> 03:06:02.400]  limit you know when they need to get to a certain critical mass of production i think to to make
[03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:10.560]  to be a successful company um it's frustrating i you know we have we both i know we both already
[03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:15.520]  not just you i know several friends who are on the list and i don't know anybody who's gotten it off
[03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:20.080]  the list even though they're obviously out there on the road the list is longer than the number
[03:06:20.080 --> 03:06:26.400]  of people who've already got them which is frustrating um but understandable but i i really
[03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:31.120]  do hope that they succeed and can ramp up production and and become more of a name i just
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:38.880]  it it's it's a remarkable product yeah and what they're doing i'm i'm more excited about them
[03:06:38.880 --> 03:06:44.880]  than i am about most or all other car makers right now because you know like and i said this
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:49.760]  in atp too so forgive me if you listen to that but you know there if you looked at the car market
[03:06:49.760 --> 03:06:53.920]  there's there's like the old way of doing things where everything is like these different components
[03:06:53.920 --> 03:06:58.240]  everyone buys from somebody and you know you you buy a computer module from this company you know
[03:06:58.240 --> 03:07:03.760]  you buy your your this module from this company and then you put the car together and it's exactly
[03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:07.440]  like what you'd expect from something that's built from a whole bunch of components from different
[03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:12.560]  vendors that no one was really integrating them that well um and it's like it's like building a
[03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:17.040]  pc and it's like the it's like the world of pcs right and everything is like more complicated
[03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:22.240]  than it needs to be it doesn't really quite work together as well as it could and then you have
[03:07:22.240 --> 03:07:29.360]  tesla and rivian who are doing everything like super custom you know a lot more in-house stuff
[03:07:29.360 --> 03:07:35.520]  at least in-house designs um you know a ton more in you know integration work custom ui and all
[03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:40.880]  the stuff the the level of integration they have and the way they're doing things and even even
[03:07:40.880 --> 03:07:45.120]  some of the features they have that no one else is really doing like i was saying like one of the
[03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:51.120]  things i miss most about about not having an electric car right now is is the tesla dog mode
[03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:56.240]  where like i can go on like we use this so much because we're constantly you know driving back
[03:07:56.240 --> 03:08:00.080]  and forth between different places so like you know the whole family will go we'll have the dog
[03:08:00.080 --> 03:08:04.720]  with us which are going for like a weekend and oh we want to stop on the way for you know a
[03:08:04.720 --> 03:08:08.720]  restaurant or something and well then you got to leave the dog in the car okay well now now you
[03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:14.400]  have to you know you know get out of the car with the get out of the gas car lock it turn the remote
[03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:19.120]  start on the remote start gives you 30 minutes and you gotta run it okay we have 30 minutes of heat
[03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:23.200]  for the dog and you know and then the car is running you know spewing gas at the back the
[03:08:23.200 --> 03:08:28.240]  whole time and it's just it's a mess and then you look at you know what you could do with tesla and
[03:08:28.240 --> 03:08:33.280]  rivian you could put it in dog mode and it's you know you could do it from it it's indefinite and
[03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:37.440]  well until the battery runs out at least that's a very very long time right just it's such a better
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:43.760]  feature like there's stuff like that so like what rivian and tesla are doing is so much nicer and
[03:08:43.760 --> 03:08:48.560]  better and more forward-looking than what almost anyone else is doing and rivian is doing a way
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:54.080]  better job than tesla at being that kind of company right now and and unless tesla has a
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:09:00.880]  major leadership change i don't see them solving the the flaws they do have and look and i i've
[03:09:00.880 --> 03:09:05.680]  been a huge tesla fan for most of the last seven or eight years whatever it's been i'm not saying
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:13.760]  tesla's bad rivian is just doing that playbook much better in a much more mature and and deliberate
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:21.440]  and controlled way and and so i'm very excited for rivian's future i really really hope that they
[03:09:22.240 --> 03:09:26.160]  you know i i don't really follow like the financials and you know the stuff like that
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:31.920]  of these companies so you know whatever stage of the company that rivian's in right now i hope
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:37.280]  they're on the good path and that they they scale up whatever they need to scale up because it's
[03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:45.280]  it's they're doing such great work with what they have so far and i i really really hope that that
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:52.160]  they are rewarded for it well said uh i say we call that a wrap thank you very much for your
[03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:59.120]  time as ever and thank you also for all of the advice you give me on what to buy yeah no problem

[03:10:52.720 --> 03:11:00.720]  i am at marco arment at mastodon right awkward right but but if you're using any of these
[03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:07.280]  budding burgeoning uh clients if you just search for marco arment you are guaranteed to find him
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:12.400]  which is perhaps the better way to do it it's like instead of that's why i said how do we do this
[03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:19.680]  it's less the it's almost a better way right in a sense where where the handles on twitter
[03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:27.280]  is an awkward sort of techy looking thing uh just search for marco arment in your favorite mastodon
[03:11:27.280 --> 03:11:32.400]  client and you'll find marco in the same way that you'll find that you'll find me and you should by
[03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:39.040]  the way we didn't talk about it but join us there it's freaking awesome and fun and doesn't have
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:44.960]  it doesn't have seem to have any jerks i don't know i don't know how long it's some but it's
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:50.880]  it's such a it's such a smaller percentage you can just easily mute them yeah it's it it is it
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:56.080]  is like twitter of old and it's wonderful that i i however long it's last i'm all in
[03:11:56.080 --> 03:12:09.600]  so thank you marco thanks a lot
