[00:00.000 --> 00:04.800]  There's been some drama in the rumor community recently.
[00:04.800 --> 00:08.480]  You sent me the link to... what was the guy's name? The guy who always had the
[00:08.480 --> 00:12.320]  dreams? Kang. Oh, I love to dream in Kang and yeah.
[00:12.320 --> 00:18.000]  Yeah, so tell me about... for people who don't know, tell me about Kang.
[00:18.000 --> 00:21.200]  So there was a few, like, I think like a lot of people who maybe listen to this
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.040]  show are familiar with the American-based reporters like Mark
[00:25.040 --> 00:30.080]  Gurman or Jon Prosser. EV leaks? I don't know how to say it. Ev leaks? EV leaks?
[00:30.080 --> 00:31.920]  Yeah. There's just... there's a bunch of them,
[00:31.920 --> 00:35.760]  just European-based too, but there was a growing contingent coming from China
[00:35.760 --> 00:38.880]  where all the supply chain is. They had access to a lot of information
[00:38.880 --> 00:43.520]  and that included Love to Dream and Kang and I don't know where Dylan DKT was
[00:43.520 --> 00:47.920]  based. No idea, but there were quite a few people who were primarily Twitter
[00:47.920 --> 00:54.080]  leakers. Which is... or Weibo. Right, which is weird, like, because I don't even
[00:54.080 --> 00:59.120]  understand what the... and I'm not so cynical
[00:59.120 --> 01:05.840]  as to... to suggest that the only reason anybody would do anything is
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.520]  to be renumerated for it financially. You know, there's certainly a lot of
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.680]  things I've done that I just, you know, give out to the world. But it's... the
[01:15.680 --> 01:19.600]  rumor thing in particular has often seemed, you know, there's always been
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.680]  rumor sites go all the way back to Think Secret. I mean, Think Secret
[01:23.680 --> 01:26.880]  isn't even going all the way back. There were... there were sites in the 90s, you
[01:26.880 --> 01:30.880]  know, I forget some of the names, but I think there was one MacRumors, which
[01:30.880 --> 01:36.320]  is not to be confused with Mac... Yeah. MacOSRumors or no, MacOSRumors, not
[01:36.320 --> 01:40.800]  to be confused with the current, you know, long-running site MacRumors. I
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.760]  don't get the leaking on Twitter thing, like, what the idea is, but I guess it's
[01:45.760 --> 01:49.440]  just, you know, just for fun, for kicks. It's not... It's for the lulz. They're, like,
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.920]  young and they have this information and they want to share it and they get
[01:51.920 --> 01:57.280]  attention for sharing it. Right. So, was Kang someone, in addition to I
[01:57.280 --> 02:02.080]  Love to Dream, as he... Kang would... would... would... would dress up his
[02:02.080 --> 02:07.920]  predictions as, like, dreams? Maybe, because I'm not familiar with the
[02:07.920 --> 02:12.000]  Weibo postings as much as I am the people who summarized them. But he would
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.800]  come out, like, right before an event and basically just list out what was going
[02:14.800 --> 02:17.920]  to be in the event. So, it was never early, early on, like, Mark Gurman might
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.160]  start a rumor or might report on a rumor three years before it happens. This was,
[02:22.160 --> 02:25.840]  like, a week or so before it happened, but they were highly accurate.
[02:25.840 --> 02:33.040]  Right. And the idea here is that there's somehow been a crackdown on them, but
[02:33.040 --> 02:38.960]  nobody is quite sure what it is. I will put a link in the show notes to this Mac
[02:38.960 --> 02:44.080]  Rumors story talking about it, which goes back to June of last year. So, it's
[02:44.080 --> 02:49.440]  not news, but... but it leads to speculate, you know, people are thinking, is it
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.680]  Apple that cracked down? Is it the supply chain? Because it seems to me,
[02:53.680 --> 02:58.800]  like, some of these leaks are clearly not just from the supply chain, but from
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.760]  Asia, you know, and maybe English is the second language. And is it, you know, is
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.960]  it second level? It's not like someone in Cupertino is directing some kind of
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.680]  crackdown on Twitter leaks of Apple rumors, but that, you know, from
[03:15.680 --> 03:19.840]  Cupertino to the supply chain, like, hey, this, you know, this leak seemed to know
[03:20.720 --> 03:25.360]  an awful lot about this component, which we know is only sourced from you, and
[03:25.360 --> 03:30.800]  then the component maker is cracking down somehow? It's just...
[03:31.920 --> 03:34.960]  Yeah, I mean, to your earlier point, like, this kind of stuff is just... it's
[03:34.960 --> 03:40.640]  part of human culture. There have been movie and TV rumor sites and papers,
[03:40.640 --> 03:44.400]  and rags, like, a lot of the rumor sites started off as actual newsletters
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.760]  and papers for years. It's just stuff people are interested in, like, and the
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.880]  more secrecy there's around, like, a Marvel or Star Wars project, the more
[03:50.880 --> 03:55.120]  people are interested, and Apple's like that for electronics. And I think that
[03:55.120 --> 03:58.880]  the main difference we're seeing here is that in the U.S. and in, well, North
[03:58.880 --> 04:02.640]  America and in Europe, there are very different kinds of protection for media,
[04:02.640 --> 04:05.920]  because we call them leakers, but, like, Mark Gurman is not a leaker, John
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.280]  Prosser is not a leaker. They are given information by leakers, and then they
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.840]  report on it, and that is protected. But in China, the laws are very different,
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.480]  and it looks like one of the aspects was... I'm going to go back to the early
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.080]  days for a while. Before the Verge was the Verge, they were This Is My Next,
[04:22.080 --> 04:26.080]  and they published a rumor of an iPhone 5, a report of an iPhone 5 that was
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.400]  teardrop-shaped, famously, infamously, and a case company went and made a ton
[04:30.400 --> 04:35.680]  of cases for it, and it never existed, but they lost everything in that. And so
[04:35.680 --> 04:38.720]  one of the statements we made in these... I don't know if they're
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.200]  lawsuits, if they're demand letters, is that you are not only giving away our
[04:43.200 --> 04:46.000]  trade secrets by releasing this information early, but you are
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.520]  potentially costing people in the accessory market money, because some of
[04:49.520 --> 04:52.000]  these things are not accurate, and they're acting on them as though they
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.640]  are accurate. Right, and you don't want to... I don't want to make light of it,
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.360]  because, I mean, if it's happening in China, it could be... it could be worse,
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.240]  you know, like, you get, like, a cease and desist letter in the U.S., and it's
[05:02.240 --> 05:05.760]  like, well, you know, you get to sit there and think about, well, do I comply,
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.920]  do I call my own lawyer, do I just rip it up, what do I do, and it's like,
[05:09.920 --> 05:12.640]  you know, worse comes to worse, you're just going to get another letter, and, you
[05:12.640 --> 05:17.040]  know, you face some sort of legal consequences, perhaps, but, you know, in
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.240]  China, you know, it could be a knock on the door, and it's, you know, not good.
[05:21.520 --> 05:22.400]  And I really don't...
[05:22.400 --> 05:23.680]  Until you've gotten very quiet.
[05:23.680 --> 05:30.000]  Yeah, but we do have rumors to discuss. I do want to discuss them, but before
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.640]  that, I was thinking, first thing we could do is talk about... Oh, I have some
[05:34.640 --> 05:36.160]  follow-up, do you mind?
[05:36.160 --> 05:37.840]  No, I love it.
[05:37.840 --> 05:43.200]  Important follow-up. My last episode was with Jason Snell, and I think I
[05:43.200 --> 05:46.800]  offhandedly mentioned, we were talking about Apple TV, we were talking about
[05:46.800 --> 05:52.400]  there's a report, there were a whole... our Apple report cards for 2021, and
[05:52.400 --> 06:01.040]  talking about Apple TV and a sort of limbo that Apple TV, the hardware
[06:01.040 --> 06:05.040]  platform seems to be in within Apple, where it's not like they're disinterested,
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.400]  they just updated it last year, they made a better remote, but they also
[06:08.400 --> 06:11.120]  don't seem fully interested.
[06:11.120 --> 06:14.960]  They're, you know, they're somewhere in between, and I was talking about
[06:16.160 --> 06:20.640]  hooking up HomePods to an Apple TV to use as your sound system, and how
[06:21.520 --> 06:26.880]  really truly happy I am with two full-size HomePods hooked up to my Apple
[06:26.880 --> 06:31.520]  TV, and then I mentioned something to the effect of not being able to do
[06:31.520 --> 06:38.160]  that with HomePod minis, which I kind of knew was glossing over the details,
[06:38.160 --> 06:41.760]  but I should get into the details, because I got a couple of emails saying,
[06:41.760 --> 06:46.560]  well, no, you can hook HomePod minis up to Apple TV. I will put a link in the
[06:46.560 --> 06:52.560]  show notes to the Apple support document, and the gist is HomePod mini does
[06:52.560 --> 06:59.520]  not support Dolby Atmos 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. Long story short.
[06:59.520 --> 07:04.560]  And I also think that even without getting into the technical details of
[07:04.560 --> 07:08.720]  which specs, like Dolby this, Dolby that, that it does or does not support,
[07:08.720 --> 07:11.840]  they're just not big enough for my living room. It's less about the
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.720]  technical aspects maybe even than just the sound quality. Two HomePods fill
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.600]  my living room with very good sound that has room to go. We can turn it up
[07:21.600 --> 07:25.440]  as loud as we feel is pleasant, and there's still room to go. I don't
[07:25.440 --> 07:31.120]  think two HomePod minis would, and it is kind of curious to me that they —
[07:31.120 --> 07:33.600]  I mean, you and I can talk about it. I mean, I don't know. I know you care
[07:33.600 --> 07:37.920]  about the HomePods too, but it is weird that HomePod is left in a situation
[07:37.920 --> 07:42.080]  where there is a HomePod mini, and there is no regular — there are no
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.040]  other HomePods. The only one is the mini, which doesn't really make it the
[07:45.040 --> 07:49.280]  mini anymore. It actually is the only HomePod available.
[07:49.280 --> 07:53.680]  Yeah, it's stupefying, and also Apple cancelled the regular — the OG HomePod
[07:53.680 --> 07:56.480]  biggie without replacing it, which is not something they typically do if they
[07:56.480 --> 07:59.760]  intend to make a next generation product. Unless that next generation
[07:59.760 --> 08:03.280]  product is so far out, it doesn't make any sense. And I'm exactly with you.
[08:03.280 --> 08:07.920]  Like with the minis, you get very little bass, and they're basically 2.0 stereo.
[08:07.920 --> 08:12.480]  And with the original HomePods, you get a ton of bass, and they will support
[08:12.480 --> 08:17.040]  spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, so you'll have everything from 2.1 to whatever,
[08:17.040 --> 08:20.800]  9.1, whatever your — whatever the source media can handle. And it's a
[08:20.800 --> 08:24.560]  profound difference. I think a lot of it was just — Apple
[08:24.560 --> 08:27.200]  started — Apple tried to do the iPod Hi-Fi again.
[08:27.200 --> 08:30.160]  They wanted — they realized that a bunch of audio products, a lot of people don't
[08:30.160 --> 08:33.440]  have good audio solutions in all of their rooms, and they just
[08:33.440 --> 08:36.560]  wanted to make a box that you could drop in any room, in any place in that room,
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.720]  and it would sound good no matter where it was
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.160]  in the room. And then they happened substantially, added Siri as a control
[08:42.160 --> 08:45.360]  mechanism — not happenstantially, but conveniently because there was no
[08:45.360 --> 08:49.280]  display — and it took them five years to develop it. And in that time,
[08:49.280 --> 08:52.320]  Amazon and Google littered the world with commodity
[08:52.320 --> 08:56.080]  smart speakers that didn't have the audio capability at all, but
[08:56.080 --> 08:59.680]  drove the price down and the expectations up for what a home
[08:59.680 --> 09:02.800]  assistant should be. And so they basically brought a very
[09:02.800 --> 09:05.600]  expensive speaker to a commodity speaker market,
[09:05.600 --> 09:08.960]  and it never got good media, never got good footing.
[09:08.960 --> 09:12.000]  A lot of people love it. They love it so much they buy everyone they can find on
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.400]  eBay, myself included. I have the same setup as
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.400]  you, but there was just no market for it, and the Mini sort of hits at that
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.840]  idealized price point, that new commodity price point of about 100 bucks.
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.520]  But nothing replaced that HomePod. Like, the Google version isn't as good.
[09:25.520 --> 09:29.600]  The Sonos version is okay, but Sonos is a fundamentally different
[09:29.600 --> 09:32.400]  product than Apple, and I would love it. There's
[09:32.400 --> 09:35.920]  rumors of a HomePod with an iPad-style screen and a
[09:35.920 --> 09:38.320]  HomePod mixed with an Apple TV that'd be a sort of a
[09:38.320 --> 09:42.480]  home theater pod, but I would also just love maybe a little bit less expensive,
[09:42.480 --> 09:47.760]  but every bit is good replacement for that HomePod.
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.640]  The other factor is eliminating wires, right? Like, that is a very Apple-like
[09:54.640 --> 09:57.200]  thing, and I know, you know, the whole — it's not like Apple's the only company
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.360]  that is interested in making wireless products.
[09:59.360 --> 10:03.280]  You know, the whole, you know, AirPods sort of
[10:03.280 --> 10:07.200]  burst — I know they weren't the first wireless headphones for consumers, but
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.720]  they're the first ones to sort of break through into the mainstream,
[10:10.720 --> 10:14.320]  and now everybody's coming out with ones that are
[10:14.320 --> 10:18.000]  meant for the masses. Sony has some new ones that even have a good name. I forget
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.360]  the name of it, but it's no longer named, like, XDR 5776. It's
[10:23.360 --> 10:26.800]  got, like, a real name. But it's, you know, home theaters,
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.280]  notoriously, you try to keep it. You're like, ah, we can, you know, get rid of this,
[10:31.280 --> 10:34.000]  get rid of that, get all the way down. Even if you get down to one box, we're
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.840]  gonna do everything through this, you know, and it's like, well, but then you
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.520]  kind of, you know, how can — yeah, you need a second box. We need a receiver for the
[10:41.520 --> 10:44.240]  speakers, and we need — or this or that, and
[10:44.240 --> 10:47.280]  everything's connected with wires, and you've got these wires going — and it's
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.840]  like — so part of the —
[10:51.840 --> 10:55.440]  it's not just physical decluttering of, like, your living room or wherever you
[10:55.440 --> 10:58.880]  have your TV set up. It's almost like mental decluttering of simplifying
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.480]  things. Like, wireless is better, right? It's, you know, it's — it goes back to
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.840]  anything. Everything that goes wireless is sort of better. Like, almost,
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.200]  I mean, I don't know what percentage of people still connect their computers
[11:11.200 --> 11:17.200]  to physical Ethernet, Jack, but certainly not many, and the ones who do
[11:17.200 --> 11:22.960]  are doing it for very specific reasons. Wi-Fi really changed that, and the HomePod
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.960]  wireless connection to the Apple TV, it's really remarkable, because you
[11:28.960 --> 11:33.520]  think, ah, it's gonna have latency or the, you know, latency with the video, like,
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.360]  maybe the lips won't be in sync with the audio, or it's gonna
[11:37.360 --> 11:41.840]  put a delay on using the remote control. You hit pause, it'll take a — you know,
[11:41.840 --> 11:45.760]  now it's all — it all feels just as fast as any kind of wired connection to
[11:45.760 --> 11:49.760]  speakers. It's, you know, and it's pretty easy to set
[11:49.760 --> 11:55.040]  up. It is a very Apple-like solution, and it's a product that they've gotten
[11:55.040 --> 11:58.960]  rid of with no replacement. It's kind of strange. I feel like the
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.440]  rumor of the one that has, like, you know, I know Facebook makes
[12:03.440 --> 12:07.600]  a thing, there's a couple other companies that make these speakers with a screen,
[12:07.600 --> 12:13.200]  that I could see maybe them making that product, it's sort of —
[12:13.200 --> 12:16.880]  I mean, I can imagine other scenarios, but it sounds like a kitchen
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.240]  product is something people would put on their kitchen counter.
[12:20.240 --> 12:23.520]  Or a grandparent product, they just want to FaceTime with the kids and don't want to
[12:23.520 --> 12:26.480]  bother with anything else. Yeah, but I don't see Apple making that,
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.480]  because I feel like, you know, if the grandparents have an iPod
[12:30.480 --> 12:36.160]  or iPad or an iPhone, it's, you know, FaceTime's already usable, you know, like
[12:36.160 --> 12:38.960]  the grandparents' scenario is already taken care of.
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.280]  Like, I feel like it's a company like Facebook that doesn't have a device like
[12:43.280 --> 12:47.040]  that, like the iPad or the iPhone, that
[12:47.040 --> 12:50.080]  wants to make a dedicated talk to the
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.960]  grandparents' hardware device. But that's not a living room device,
[12:54.960 --> 12:57.760]  right? Like, there's no way you want to get a HomePod
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.040]  with its own screen just to use as speakers for your TV set, right? I mean,
[13:03.040 --> 13:05.680]  what would you ever use the screen for? It's —
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.040]  it doesn't seem — who knows what they're doing. But anyway, I wanted to follow.
[13:09.040 --> 13:11.600]  Anything, there could be like just a HomePod dock, where you put the HomePod on it,
[13:11.600 --> 13:13.600]  you stick your iPad on it when you want to use it in the kitchen, and when you
[13:13.600 --> 13:18.800]  don't, you pick it up and walk away. Yeah. I do feel like the — it's funny,
[13:18.800 --> 13:23.360]  because this has been a decade long — more than a decade long.
[13:23.360 --> 13:26.800]  I mean, I don't know when good old Gene Munster first started
[13:26.800 --> 13:31.680]  speculating on Apple making an Apple-branded TV set.
[13:31.680 --> 13:34.960]  When he saw the 27-inch iMac panels, he mistook them for a television set.
[13:34.960 --> 13:42.880]  Yeah, well, that was a long time ago. Yep. I do — and, you know, and people have
[13:42.880 --> 13:47.120]  had this idea, and in a broad sense,
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.280]  it's certainly, you know, it's almost like circa 2005,
[13:51.280 --> 13:55.200]  2006, talking, well, I think Apple should make a phone.
[13:55.200 --> 13:58.560]  I do. You know, phones are starting to play MP3s.
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.720]  You know, why carry two devices? You know, I think Apple should make a phone.
[14:02.720 --> 14:05.920]  And then they did, and it all made sense when we saw the iPhone.
[14:05.920 --> 14:09.360]  And it's like in that same general sense, there's like a vague sense of Apple
[14:09.360 --> 14:12.000]  should make stuff for the living room for your
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.160]  home entertainment. And yeah, that sounds good. But then when
[14:16.160 --> 14:19.680]  you get to the details, it's like your living room is so —
[14:19.680 --> 14:22.720]  the difference is that the phone was one thing.
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.080]  You just — if you bought that iPhone, then you
[14:26.080 --> 14:29.840]  put your cell phone number and your carrier account, you know, if you had AT&T,
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.040]  but, you know, let's flash forward to where they had carrier support around
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.560]  the world. You know, you buy the iPhone, and then
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.920]  that's your phone. And it's your camera, and it's your iPod,
[14:39.920 --> 14:42.320]  and it's, you know, this, that, the other thing
[14:42.320 --> 14:45.440]  famously. But you just buy that one thing, whereas the
[14:45.440 --> 14:49.920]  living room, even as you get rid of boxes, you're like, well, I don't need a separate
[14:49.920 --> 14:54.080]  DVR. I've cut the cable. I can just, you know, get like an app to get my TV
[14:54.080 --> 14:57.680]  service, and I can eliminate some boxes. But it's still —
[14:57.680 --> 15:01.920]  there's the set, there's at least one box or a stick in the back or
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.520]  something, and, you know, speakers — I mean,
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.040]  really the only way to do it as just the simplest possible thing is to just
[15:11.040 --> 15:14.160]  buy a TV set. Don't hook it up to any external
[15:14.160 --> 15:18.400]  speakers. Don't put a stick or a Apple TV box in the back and
[15:18.400 --> 15:23.920]  just use the built-in Netflix and Hulu and Disney or whatever comes on your TV.
[15:23.920 --> 15:27.200]  You can do that. I'm sure there are people who do that. And
[15:27.200 --> 15:31.440]  the sound coming from TVs, like we got our new LGV
[15:31.440 --> 15:37.200]  TV two years ago, I guess, and for various reasons didn't have it
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.760]  hooked up to any kind of external speakers for a
[15:41.760 --> 15:44.480]  while. The sound is actually surprisingly good.
[15:44.480 --> 15:48.400]  Really, really quite usable. Like, dangerously usable
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.960]  insofar as it inspired laziness on my part to actually
[15:52.960 --> 15:56.640]  do something like what I ended up doing and hook up two HomePods to it.
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.640]  But it's really good. So it is possible, but then we're back to
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.920]  square one of Apple making an Apple-branded TV set, because that's the
[16:03.920 --> 16:07.760]  one thing you definitely need in any setup is the TV set. And for
[16:07.760 --> 16:11.280]  various reasons, I think they decided against it a long
[16:11.280 --> 16:14.560]  time ago. Yeah, they prototyped at least two of
[16:14.560 --> 16:17.520]  them, and it's just, it was, there was no interesting core technologies.
[16:17.520 --> 16:20.480]  There was no super differentiation they could offer. The upgrade cycles are
[16:20.480 --> 16:22.640]  terrible on television, which means they can't,
[16:22.640 --> 16:24.800]  like, increase the silicon the way they can on a
[16:24.800 --> 16:28.560]  on an Apple TV small box. It just, it didn't make sense. There wasn't a
[16:28.560 --> 16:31.120]  compelling experience that Apple thought that they could offer to the market.
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.560]  Right, and I heard that at least one of the prototypes they
[16:34.560 --> 16:38.720]  built was sort of along, and who knows, this could be apocryphal.
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.680]  It's the sort of story that is six degrees of separation from anybody who
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.480]  had direct knowledge of it, but that it was like, you know, like a
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.880]  dream TV from Johnny Ive's team, and it was like, I don't know,
[16:52.880 --> 16:56.480]  six or seven thousand dollars, you know, and I don't know what year. It's
[16:56.480 --> 16:59.760]  what they watched the World Cup in in IL-3 in the old days, or IL-2 in the old
[16:59.760 --> 17:02.240]  days. Right, and I've, you know, I heard a similar
[17:02.240 --> 17:06.480]  story years ago, you know, that there was not even a
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.960]  prototype. Like, I don't think that it was a built
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.720]  thing that you could drive around, but at least a specked out,
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.960]  sketched out take on an Apple car, and it was just ridiculously expensive,
[17:18.960 --> 17:22.160]  you know, when they, you know, all right, this looks cool, and this looks like
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.040]  something we would put the Apple name on, and here, go figure out how much this
[17:27.040 --> 17:30.080]  would cost, and then the people who figure that sort of thing out came back,
[17:30.080 --> 17:33.520]  and it was, I don't know, like, at least over a hundred thousand dollars, and it's
[17:33.520 --> 17:36.400]  like, well, that's, you know, that's too much. They would
[17:36.400 --> 17:39.520]  never ever do it, but it would be so great to just get a version of that book
[17:39.520 --> 17:42.400]  that Johnny, Ivan, and Apple put out with the, with their history of their products,
[17:42.400 --> 17:45.680]  but the ones they didn't ship that had the original car sketches in it, the
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.000]  original TV sketches in it, all of that stuff.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.360]  I wonder if they made a version of the book
[17:51.360 --> 17:57.280]  with just a, you know, to the other, you know, and in hindsight, that book,
[17:57.280 --> 18:02.720]  it's, you know, you didn't have to be a genius to wonder if Johnny
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.000]  was getting ready to leave Apple, and the book was sort of,
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.400]  you know, something to sort of, you know, like a bow, yeah, like to close the door
[18:10.400 --> 18:14.880]  on this time, would have been good to have the book.
[18:14.880 --> 18:18.000]  I wonder if that, but that book would probably be a lot thicker, although I
[18:18.000 --> 18:22.400]  guess you could edit it to just the, just the ones that make your heart
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.440]  ache, you know, like, oh, if only we could have,
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.640]  that would be a good book. Yeah, yep. All right, let me take a break
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.800]  here, and thank our first sponsor, it's our good friends at
[18:34.800 --> 18:41.760]  Linode. Linode, go to linode.com slash the talk show,

[20:34.960 --> 20:39.040]  All right, air tags. Before we get to the rumors,
[20:39.040 --> 20:42.800]  do you see Kashmir Hill's New York Times story? She does such good work and
[20:42.800 --> 20:45.920]  investigative stuff, but she's like a tech columnist for the New York
[20:45.920 --> 20:50.480]  Times, and what she did was, with permission, she planted
[20:50.480 --> 20:59.280]  three trackers on her husband. Air tags, a tile tracker,
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.400]  and something that I'd never heard of, she describes as a hockey puck-like
[21:04.400 --> 21:08.560]  GPS tracker from a company called Land Air Sea
[21:08.560 --> 21:11.760]  that she put in the glove compartment of his car, and
[21:11.760 --> 21:15.200]  she wrote about how she was able to follow him as he went about, you know, I
[21:15.200 --> 21:18.560]  think they live in the New York suburbs. She described a trip he took with
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.080]  their daughter to the doctor because I think they thought she had COVID or
[21:22.080 --> 21:25.840]  something, and then he had a day of business in
[21:25.840 --> 21:29.840]  Manhattan. Really interesting kind of eye-opening,
[21:29.840 --> 21:33.280]  you know, and also not overly dramatized, you know,
[21:33.280 --> 21:37.760]  it was not like a scary, you should be terrified of all these trackers,
[21:37.760 --> 21:41.600]  you know, that sort of take. And it was multiple trackers because almost every
[21:41.600 --> 21:45.120]  other article has focused exclusively on air tags as if they were alone in the
[21:45.120 --> 21:49.920]  industry. Right, right, and it's interesting because, like,
[21:49.920 --> 21:54.400]  because this Land Air Sea thing has its own built-in GPS,
[21:54.400 --> 21:59.120]  it obviously doesn't require it, so that was better for tracking
[21:59.120 --> 22:02.160]  her husband and daughter as they drove to the doctor
[22:02.160 --> 22:05.760]  where they were on a highway and maybe not near any other
[22:05.760 --> 22:10.160]  Apple devices that would locate the air tag and ping the location.
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.000]  Something with built-in GPS is obviously going to be
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.080]  more available at any time no matter where it is,
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.080]  whereas the air tag was obviously more useful for tracking her husband when he
[22:22.080 --> 22:26.800]  was in Manhattan surrounded by people with Macbooks and
[22:26.800 --> 22:31.840]  iPhones especially. Pretty interesting, and it coincided, I
[22:31.840 --> 22:34.640]  think it was totally a coincidence because I think Apple was working on
[22:34.640 --> 22:39.440]  this, but like a day or two before her her story dropped, Apple had announced
[22:39.440 --> 22:43.440]  their updated initiatives to increase the
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.120]  what would you call it, the transparency and
[22:47.120 --> 22:51.040]  notifications, you know, like there's, you know, and I think rightly so,
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.360]  the awareness of that these things exist
[22:55.360 --> 22:58.880]  and what happens when one is found with you
[22:58.880 --> 23:02.640]  and you had, I thought, a terrific video
[23:02.640 --> 23:07.680]  talking about this. Thank you. Pointing out specifically
[23:07.680 --> 23:11.760]  the conflict, like the fundamental conflict that it can
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.520]  air tags can't do both of these things at once, which is
[23:15.520 --> 23:19.360]  be privacy aware so that they try their best
[23:19.360 --> 23:23.280]  to alert people that one has been surreptitiously
[23:23.280 --> 23:30.000]  planted on them and be used as an anti-theft device that won't notify the
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.080]  thief that the thing that they've stolen that
[23:32.080 --> 23:36.880]  has an air tag is being tracked. Yeah, and it goes even beyond that
[23:36.880 --> 23:39.520]  because I think like I used more extreme examples, like you have in
[23:39.520 --> 23:42.720]  one side you have anti-stalking and then on the
[23:42.720 --> 23:46.400]  other side you have lost item recovery and then on another
[23:46.400 --> 23:49.520]  side you have stolen item recovery and those are all
[23:49.520 --> 23:52.000]  very different tasks and you have to optimize very
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.720]  differently for them, but even in the narrow focus
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.840]  of just recovering lost items, if you're not careful with how you
[23:59.840 --> 24:03.440]  balance this out, you can't sit on a bus or on a train without your phone popping
[24:03.440 --> 24:06.480]  every three seconds because other people have their own air
[24:06.480 --> 24:09.920]  tags with them or a kid has an air tag their parent put in their bag or
[24:09.920 --> 24:13.360]  something and also like you want to you want to find your
[24:13.360 --> 24:15.920]  stolen wallet but if it's peeping all the time
[24:15.920 --> 24:19.280]  someone else might find it who didn't steal it but they find it your camera
[24:19.280 --> 24:22.800]  bag your wallet and because it's beeping and they have pinpoint accuracy to it
[24:22.800 --> 24:26.720]  they go and remove the money or remove the the cameras before you can come back
[24:26.720 --> 24:29.760]  and find your bag and I think it's really really easy and
[24:29.760 --> 24:34.400]  kind of cynical to sit there and like it's a tool it's a
[24:34.400 --> 24:36.880]  technology tools technologies have problems
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.640]  I'm reminded of when Apple announced the hearing aid feature for AirPods
[24:40.640 --> 24:42.640]  immediately there were a bunch of stories about how people were going to
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.320]  use these to eavesdrop on each other with very little consideration for
[24:46.320 --> 24:49.440]  people who actually need this as an accessibility function
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.840]  and just the the scope of the stories I think have been a huge distortion
[24:53.840 --> 24:57.680]  to what the actual technology can do and Apple is I think
[24:57.680 --> 25:01.280]  they were alone in the industry in providing any form of
[25:01.280 --> 25:05.200]  notifications registering devices with your
[25:05.200 --> 25:08.640]  with your sorry registering air tags with your devices with your Apple ID
[25:08.640 --> 25:12.480]  working with law enforcement under subpoena we had years of tiles we had
[25:12.480 --> 25:16.080]  Samsung tags for years we've had these GPS devices for years
[25:16.080 --> 25:18.320]  where there's been none of those affordances
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.240]  and almost zero coverage of them but when Apple enters a market the attention
[25:22.240 --> 25:25.200]  is so much that it helps absolutely helps in
[25:25.200 --> 25:29.360]  bringing this awareness to it but I think it's also opportunistically
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.680]  distorted by a lot of the coverage around it yeah I think that's well said
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.200]  and you know part of it is that they timed it right
[25:37.200 --> 25:43.040]  I think you know that you know they built out the find my network first
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.440]  the the privacy aware way that that it works where you're
[25:49.440 --> 25:51.760]  complete you know complete strangers who are
[25:51.760 --> 25:54.240]  participating in the fine by network with
[25:54.240 --> 25:58.480]  with capable recent Apple devices like iPhones which is the big one because
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.760]  it's the most mobile right it puts the mobile and mobile
[26:03.760 --> 26:10.080]  you know when they pick up a ping from like an air tag or other devices that
[26:10.080 --> 26:12.960]  are on the find my network they can report it
[26:12.960 --> 26:18.160]  in an anonymous way where you know there's no way for the person
[26:18.160 --> 26:21.600]  whose iPhone is saying hey I just picked up a ping from an air tag they don't
[26:21.600 --> 26:25.120]  know whose air tag it is they don't even know that it happened
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.360]  you know that the ping was sent and you the person who owned the air tag don't
[26:29.360 --> 26:33.040]  know that this person walked by with their iPhone and sent a
[26:33.040 --> 26:38.080]  ping to update your air tech so they built that out first they
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.520]  and did the hard work of getting you know a billion plus devices in
[26:43.520 --> 26:47.280]  circulation around the world which makes it usable right like you can have
[26:47.280 --> 26:52.480]  all this technology in place the exact same thing as Apple's find my
[26:52.480 --> 26:57.920]  and if you only have a million devices which would be you know for many
[26:57.920 --> 27:00.880]  companies would be great to have a million devices in use but that's a
[27:00.880 --> 27:05.600]  thousand fold decrease it it would be less useful
[27:05.600 --> 27:08.560]  because I was early problem right well I think it's still tiles I
[27:08.560 --> 27:11.120]  think it's the I think it's the fundamental problem with tiles whole
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.520]  concept was that they never had enough devices
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.640]  sending the pings to you know to to update them and I think
[27:20.640 --> 27:23.120]  you know going back to Kashmir hill story in the New York Times I think
[27:23.120 --> 27:26.640]  that's why the the tile tracker didn't wasn't as useful for tracking her
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.640]  husband's whereabouts because there's just not enough it's it
[27:30.640 --> 27:35.920]  truly is it's like the definition of network effects right yeah which is
[27:35.920 --> 27:38.800]  why tiles partnering with Amazon now to greatly increase their footprint
[27:38.800 --> 27:43.280]  right like network effects are such a bizarre concept I think Bob Metcalf the
[27:43.280 --> 27:47.360]  inventor of ethernet first defined it but it's like the
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.400]  fax machine is like the perfect example it's like yeah you know it's like one
[27:52.400 --> 27:55.200]  person who has a fax machine it's completely
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.800]  useless two people have a fax machine and it might be useful if assuming they
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.640]  know each other and want to send each other faxes
[28:04.640 --> 28:11.280]  semi-frequently but like at the peak of faxes facsimiles you know
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.960]  utility in our world almost everybody had one
[28:14.960 --> 28:19.840]  and there was a while where it was assumed it became so ubiquitous that
[28:19.840 --> 28:25.840]  it was assumed that oh if you want to uh you know uh open up a new bank account
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.040]  you know you'll just send a fax here and it's like well I I'm at home I don't
[28:29.040 --> 28:32.720]  have a fax you know and and there were like email to fax services and stuff
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.320]  like that so that you could get without having a fax machine at home or
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.280]  a separate line just to have for your fax because you'd have to have a
[28:39.280 --> 28:42.400]  separate phone line blah blah blah but it's like once they're everywhere
[28:42.400 --> 28:46.160]  they were very useful but when there's only like a few of them
[28:46.160 --> 28:49.120]  they're not useful and how do you get from
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.320]  well this is a great idea but we need to get you know
[28:52.320 --> 28:55.280]  tens of millions of them out in the world that's that's
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.760]  the mystery and you know air tags have that
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.560]  with the find my network and tile doesn't you know it's not useless you
[29:04.560 --> 29:06.960]  know people have tiles and they use them but
[29:06.960 --> 29:13.680]  it's clearly not as useful um so the changes apple announced uh
[29:13.680 --> 29:16.960]  one of them is that they seemingly identified
[29:16.960 --> 29:20.400]  i would even call it a bug where people were getting
[29:20.400 --> 29:26.880]  a spurious warning that an unidentified device has been found near you
[29:26.880 --> 29:34.800]  or with with you for blank and an awful lot of people i'd reasonably
[29:34.800 --> 29:37.280]  so assumed that that meant there was an air
[29:37.280 --> 29:41.120]  tag with them and then they'd like look around like let's say they're in their
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.320]  car and it says an unidentified uh you know
[29:44.320 --> 29:47.120]  tracking dev our device has been found with you
[29:47.120 --> 29:50.640]  uh you know from the find my network and then they're like huh
[29:50.640 --> 29:53.840]  i don't have one of those and then they'd like tear their car apart or look
[29:53.840 --> 29:57.120]  around or say send a you know uh play a sound or
[29:57.120 --> 29:59.440]  something and nothing would happen and it turned
[29:59.440 --> 30:03.760]  out it wasn't air tags it was like other devices like
[30:03.760 --> 30:08.320]  air pods yeah air pods yeah which is yeah and that was just because
[30:08.320 --> 30:11.360]  the the label was not being identified if it was air tags it would tell you it
[30:11.360 --> 30:13.760]  was air tags but if it wasn't it would just say it was an unknown
[30:13.760 --> 30:16.560]  device which is terrifying because it's nothing more terrifying
[30:16.560 --> 30:19.520]  than the unknown right right it's actually scarier
[30:19.520 --> 30:24.480]  um yeah yeah i i've had a i had a couple people it does seem
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.280]  you know and it gets to these arguments about apple software reliability i mean
[30:29.280 --> 30:31.280]  for the most part this stuff works so good
[30:31.280 --> 30:35.120]  and but it does seem like there are some cracks in the system
[30:35.120 --> 30:40.240]  like i have one regular reader who rides his bicycle to commute to work
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.680]  and while he's riding his bicycle he puts
[30:43.680 --> 30:48.160]  one air pod in so that his other ear can you know pay attention to traffic and
[30:48.160 --> 30:53.360]  everything else going about and that almost every day or every day
[30:53.360 --> 30:57.120]  when he goes home from work he gets that alert on his phone that
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.720]  there's an unknown device near you and it's it's his other air
[31:00.720 --> 31:03.600]  pod that's in or or he gets the thing that
[31:03.600 --> 31:08.080]  says you left your air pod behind he gets one or the other in neither
[31:08.080 --> 31:11.920]  case is it unknown it's his other ears air pod in the air
[31:11.920 --> 31:15.760]  pod case in his pocket and it's not left behind at work and
[31:15.760 --> 31:20.560]  it's not an unknown device so hopefully with ios i guess it's an
[31:20.560 --> 31:24.240]  ios 15.4 thing where this fix is coming hopefully they
[31:24.240 --> 31:27.680]  get that straightened out but it is it's you're absolutely right that it
[31:27.680 --> 31:32.800]  seems like the worst possible warning is an unknown device yeah and it's
[31:32.800 --> 31:34.800]  interesting because apple gets so much attention
[31:34.800 --> 31:37.360]  that's part of the benefit that they get anytime they announce a new product
[31:37.360 --> 31:40.160]  there is an ungodly amount of media coverage on it but the equal and
[31:40.160 --> 31:42.320]  opposite of that is that anytime they introduce a
[31:42.320 --> 31:45.280]  technology even if it's not new like they introduced touch id and people
[31:45.280 --> 31:48.240]  hammered on it even though you know samsung and htc had
[31:48.240 --> 31:51.840]  been storing fingerprint photos and world readable directories for years
[31:51.840 --> 31:55.440]  they just they just didn't have the attention gravity that apple did
[31:55.440 --> 32:00.080]  but i do worry because the like i hate the word fake news i hate
[32:00.080 --> 32:02.800]  when people use fake news as a way to attack coverage
[32:02.800 --> 32:05.920]  or accountability or those things because uh
[32:05.920 --> 32:09.040]  news coverage is like is the one of the only defenses that we actually have
[32:09.040 --> 32:13.200]  between us and the world around us but there's also
[32:13.200 --> 32:16.560]  and i don't know if it's just post oj simpson or when it is where
[32:16.560 --> 32:21.360]  news got distorted into this continual sensationalization like this complete
[32:21.360 --> 32:23.520]  thirst to the point where it's now trying to
[32:23.520 --> 32:27.280]  shape the story like it's no longer these are the facts what are the
[32:27.280 --> 32:30.560]  narratives that can be drawn from these facts how likely are
[32:30.560 --> 32:34.080]  each of those narratives but it's more like i want to make a story like neil
[32:34.080 --> 32:37.280]  neil seibart was joking um but only a little bit where he said
[32:37.280 --> 32:41.200]  you know i i message is so popular with us teens we're not going to report that
[32:41.200 --> 32:44.240]  oh we could say that they're bullying teens yeah go run with that
[32:44.240 --> 32:47.280]  but i think a lot of times you look at the coverage and it is that
[32:47.280 --> 32:50.240]  and if you look at air tags absolutely they're way more popular way more
[32:50.240 --> 32:53.280]  attention than any of the previous versions of the product but the
[32:53.280 --> 32:56.160]  coverage has been almost universally that these are a
[32:56.160 --> 32:59.840]  stalking device even though if you are a criminal you
[32:59.840 --> 33:02.160]  have to be the dumbest criminal in the world
[33:02.160 --> 33:05.200]  to want to use air tags because of all the tattle tale
[33:05.200 --> 33:08.640]  features that apple built into them that don't exist at all
[33:08.640 --> 33:12.160]  in any other version including the better ones like the gps ones that yes
[33:12.160 --> 33:15.440]  do require an account but give you all of like the benefits
[33:15.440 --> 33:19.280]  with none of the drawbacks and that's that except for this article
[33:19.280 --> 33:20.880]  when we're talking about the new york times
[33:20.880 --> 33:24.080]  none of that has been presented consistently or in context at all over
[33:24.080 --> 33:28.160]  the last few months right you can't set up air tags like if
[33:28.160 --> 33:31.840]  you you know go to the apple store buy some factory fresh ones
[33:31.840 --> 33:35.360]  and you want to start tracking some something
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.200]  you know for for good purposes for bad purposes whatever you just want to start
[33:39.200 --> 33:43.280]  using it to track something you can't get it activated onto the
[33:43.280 --> 33:45.920]  find by network without associating it with
[33:45.920 --> 33:51.440]  an apple id and if it's your apple id which
[33:51.440 --> 33:55.360]  apparently has happened because of you know like you said for
[33:55.360 --> 33:58.480]  lack of a better word dumb criminals who aren't really thinking
[33:58.480 --> 34:02.080]  about it um aren't really thinking about the fact
[34:02.080 --> 34:06.080]  that they just set it up with their own apple id and that it works both ways and
[34:06.080 --> 34:08.480]  that if the person finds it and contacts law
[34:08.480 --> 34:11.760]  enforcement and law enforcement gets in touch with apple that they could say oh
[34:11.760 --> 34:14.640]  yeah this is you know so-and-so's air tag and they
[34:14.640 --> 34:17.120]  have they confirmed that they've been working with law enforcement on it
[34:17.120 --> 34:23.440]  um you know and it's it in theory i guess you know somebody
[34:23.440 --> 34:27.840]  with with the bad intentions could create a
[34:27.840 --> 34:32.720]  throw away apple ids to do that and and i'm not they have so much
[34:32.720 --> 34:36.000]  telemetry like apple has so like the locate like there's so much telemetry
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.040]  that can be drawn off even just metadata that that probably won't help obscure
[34:39.040 --> 34:42.720]  you very much well and i'm also presumably you know
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.400]  like anybody who gets to be a sufficiently large service like
[34:46.400 --> 34:49.520]  that especially if you can if there's a free tier
[34:49.520 --> 34:53.040]  of any service like there is with apple ids
[34:53.040 --> 34:57.360]  you know these companies have built up inordinately complicated
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.320]  systems to try to keep people with not even criminal intentions but just
[35:02.320 --> 35:06.560]  who are looking to abuse abuse the system um like let's like what
[35:06.560 --> 35:08.960]  if you wanted to just oh yeah i guess it's sort of criminal
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.480]  to send spam but if you just wanted to make a new uh whatever at icloud.com
[35:14.480 --> 35:17.760]  account just to send spam or harassing emails
[35:17.760 --> 35:22.080]  or something like that they have systems in place i don't know what they are i've
[35:22.080 --> 35:25.600]  i haven't tried to create throw away icloud accounts but
[35:25.600 --> 35:29.760]  it's not as easy as you would think and there's other ways that
[35:29.760 --> 35:33.280]  that they can try to track it but it is a problem right like that's the other
[35:33.280 --> 35:36.000]  thing especially with location-based devices
[35:36.000 --> 35:40.080]  right so let's you know it's not like oh nobody should be worried about it it's
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.000]  you know we definitely should i yes there were
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.120]  widespread reports and you know you mentioned john prosser i think prosser
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.040]  amongst the rumor rumorists whatever you want to call them
[35:53.040 --> 35:59.040]  yeah had air tags pretty early and they did not actually get announced
[35:59.040 --> 36:05.360]  and ship until much later and it's partly speculation and partly
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.960]  you know whispering through the grapevine that the problem wasn't
[36:08.960 --> 36:13.120]  the hardware which was completed relatively early
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.480]  um earlier than when it shipped but working
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.120]  through the systematic ways of well how how should this
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.400]  work from every step of the way like the person who owns it how do we protect
[36:28.400 --> 36:31.600]  their privacy and and make this work for them and how do
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.560]  we protect this from being abused and that it was thinking through all of
[36:36.560 --> 36:39.920]  those issues that took longer than expected or at least
[36:39.920 --> 36:43.520]  took longer than it did to develop the hardware
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.160]  yeah no and absolutely i also think there's a benefit of apple entering
[36:46.160 --> 36:48.720]  these markets and that it does raise awareness
[36:48.720 --> 36:51.440]  and now like people were not talking about this before and it's been a
[36:51.440 --> 36:53.520]  problem like this a problem with stalking people using
[36:53.520 --> 36:57.520]  technology every two-bit procedural show on television has shown
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.120]  someone throwing a phone into someone's bag or car to track them with
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.400]  um and with but and that's like by the time tv gets to it it's been a problem
[37:04.400 --> 37:07.680]  for a decade already and in way more serious form so at
[37:07.680 --> 37:10.320]  least uh this has always been a serious problem
[37:10.320 --> 37:13.440]  the stalking the abuse harassment is a huge problem and this has
[37:13.440 --> 37:16.800]  raised a lot of awareness around that and hopefully other technologies
[37:16.800 --> 37:20.080]  and laws and regulations will be updated like
[37:20.080 --> 37:23.600]  if you commit a felony when possession of a firearm you get it you get a much
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.200]  higher increased sentence maybe we have to have a stronger sentence for people
[37:27.200 --> 37:29.680]  who commit crimes using location tracking
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.280]  technology some form of disincentive but you you
[37:33.280 --> 37:35.760]  you i was going to say if they'd known what they knew now they'd become a
[37:35.760 --> 37:41.440]  watchmaker they already make watches but um you can't you can't un-invent this
[37:41.440 --> 37:44.320]  stuff all you can do is try to deal with it
[37:44.320 --> 37:47.920]  well and i think that that's there's there's i forget the exact name of it
[37:47.920 --> 37:49.760]  i'll i'll try to look it up but there's a
[37:49.760 --> 37:53.280]  great twitter account that i follow like the internet pessimists
[37:53.280 --> 37:59.840]  archive um yeah and it's just occasional posts of
[37:59.840 --> 38:03.440]  the pessimists archive i will put this in the
[38:03.440 --> 38:07.520]  uh but all sorts of technical achievements or
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.800]  perhaps every technical achievement throughout history was
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.720]  you know bemoaned for its trade-offs and the trade-offs are real but you know
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.760]  like the telegraph and the telephone and oh my god now
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.760]  with the telephone i know recorded music like the phonograph like
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.160]  being able to play a record was bemoaned by i think john philip sousa
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.920]  in particular that this was going to completely pervert people's love for
[38:29.920 --> 38:33.440]  live music and yeah even things like bizarre
[38:33.440 --> 38:37.360]  things like novels you know which which when we grew up
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.480]  was like oh my god stop reading uh comic books and watching tv you should
[38:42.480 --> 38:45.280]  read a book right reading books was good but like
[38:45.280 --> 38:49.680]  when novels first became mass market things that people could
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.280]  afford like with paperbacks and stuff in the late 1800s
[38:53.280 --> 38:56.400]  it was like oh this this novel fad is ruining
[38:56.400 --> 38:59.680]  you know that's all people are doing is reading these novels this is
[38:59.680 --> 39:03.840]  you know it's turning everybody's minds to mush everything is like that there's
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.760]  always trade-offs you know ubiquitous cameras are
[39:07.760 --> 39:11.520]  obviously one that is fresh fresh into that like
[39:11.520 --> 39:14.000]  change like changing rooms there was a huge uproar
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.480]  about camera phones and changing rooms for a long time
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.920]  right and i i even mentioned this a few episodes ago i forget
[39:19.920 --> 39:22.960]  who was on the show but i mentioned uh the the
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.200]  the fact that in japan it was a real problem because they had the they had
[39:27.200 --> 39:30.720]  camera phones earlier than most people you know that they were
[39:30.720 --> 39:34.800]  they were sort of ahead on using your phone for things like getting on the
[39:34.800 --> 39:38.160]  subway and stuff by just waving your phone at it with
[39:38.160 --> 39:42.560]  you know wireless technology and stuff but that they had a real problem
[39:42.560 --> 39:47.840]  with uh let's face it men using their camera to try to shoot
[39:47.840 --> 39:51.760]  surreptitious photos up up yes up the skirts of women on the
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.720]  subway and stuff like that and so the it's
[39:56.720 --> 40:00.640]  i actually i i wish i had a better note i actually i think i said on the show
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.120]  that it's the law that every camera in japan has to make an
[40:05.120 --> 40:10.000]  audible shutters down at all times and i think
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.600]  oh man this will be follow up for my next show but i think somebody told me
[40:13.600 --> 40:17.520]  that it's not actually a law but that everybody voluntarily
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.840]  complies with it including apple and so even if you have like your iphone
[40:21.840 --> 40:25.520]  mute switch on or have the volume turned down when you take a photo
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.800]  it always makes a click which is super annoying because the reason for it
[40:30.800 --> 40:34.800]  is this idea in japan that you'd want to do that to to make everybody around you
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.000]  aware that you're taking a photo for privacy's sake but
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.320]  everybody can imagine various scenarios where you don't want your phone to make
[40:42.320 --> 40:46.080]  a camera click right like yes let's say you're at the baby
[40:46.080 --> 40:50.320]  whistleblower sleeping baby your kids play like a quiet
[40:50.320 --> 40:54.320]  dramatic moment in your kid's school play and then there you are click
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.240]  you know it's it you can imagine the parental controls too like people
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.480]  complain there were no potential parental controls
[41:00.480 --> 41:03.360]  and then when they established them there was a problem with abusive people
[41:03.360 --> 41:06.240]  in relationships using parental controls to control the
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.280]  devices or mdms to control the devices of the people they were
[41:09.280 --> 41:12.240]  abusing it's incredibly complicated and non-trivial
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.600]  yeah uh and you know tracking is obviously one of these things you know
[41:17.600 --> 41:21.280]  it's it's obviously only going to become more common
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.960]  i mean we're it's it sounds like science fiction but it's like a lot of what we
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.400]  have now in our pockets people the
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.600]  devices that people are listening to this show me and you talk on
[41:33.600 --> 41:37.360]  are you know word of the things of science fiction not that long ago
[41:37.360 --> 41:43.360]  you know within our lifetimes uh and as as little brother right as
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.520]  stuff shrinks it's going to become you know uh
[41:47.520 --> 41:51.840]  more of a problem i mean we're not even getting into
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.280]  drones becoming silent and much smaller and much cheaper you know i mean that's
[41:57.280 --> 42:00.800]  sort of not the nightmare scenario but
[42:00.800 --> 42:04.000]  there are nightmare scenarios that stem from
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.920]  ubiquitous silent little insect-sized drones
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.000]  right it's you know it how in the world do you remain private when something
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.760]  that looks like a housefly might be something somebody's using to
[42:15.760 --> 42:19.600]  spy on you you know and john they sent us the terminator they sent us the
[42:19.600 --> 42:24.240]  matrix and we're here anyway we do this to ourselves yeah so it's
[42:24.240 --> 42:26.880]  coming we already have these other devices
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.200]  that do know our location uh so do it to ourselves we are bugging
[42:31.200 --> 42:34.880]  and tracking ourselves now so i thought it was a little pessimistic
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.080]  when like the story came out there was one you know high
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.400]  profile story of like a model a woman who's like a model or an actress
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.360]  or something in new york who's who was out with her friends and
[42:47.360 --> 42:51.280]  got the notification on her phone and found an air tag in her purse that
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.040]  you know seemingly some creep put in there
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.880]  but she'd already gotten home so maybe he'd know he found out where she lived
[42:58.880 --> 43:01.120]  and you know she went to the police and the press
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.880]  and it got highly publicized and the pessimistic take was that hey
[43:04.880 --> 43:08.400]  i and i saw a couple people you know both privately and publicly people who
[43:08.400 --> 43:11.920]  emailed me and people i saw on twitter speculating that hey maybe apple should
[43:11.920 --> 43:15.920]  just scrap this whole air tags thing and you know just say you know what this
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.200]  was a bad idea and and stop selling them because this
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.120]  this is no good and i say that's pessimistic because i
[43:23.120 --> 43:25.840]  think it's inevitable anyway even if apple
[43:25.840 --> 43:28.960]  were to get out of it this this problem isn't going away someone
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.640]  else is just going to make them and yeah samsung tags aren't going anywhere
[43:32.640 --> 43:37.120]  uh you know it's something we also do you remember like in the
[43:37.120 --> 43:40.240]  early days like for years on instagram every photo
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.520]  you could tap on the location it would show you exactly where it was
[43:43.520 --> 43:46.320]  and there was a huge controversy when a bunch of models found out that they had
[43:46.320 --> 43:49.840]  been posting pictures from home and like people have been stalking and
[43:49.840 --> 43:52.560]  creeping them for months and months just by tapping
[43:52.560 --> 43:55.520]  that little button on instagram there wasn't the kind of coverage there was of
[43:55.520 --> 43:59.520]  air tags but that was that was an incredible invasion or
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.240]  location disclosure and it just went on and on and
[44:02.240 --> 44:05.920]  on this technique there's you have to i don't want to be a
[44:05.920 --> 44:08.000]  pessimist about it but this stuff exists now
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.960]  and we have to sort of figure out new rules for humanity on how to deal with
[44:10.960 --> 44:14.160]  it yeah that that metadata in the photos is
[44:14.160 --> 44:17.280]  so useful right and and that's part of how a lot of
[44:17.280 --> 44:20.160]  these problems happen and and you know i think it's happened
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.920]  with with apple products in a lot of ways because i think
[44:23.920 --> 44:27.440]  it's more natural for most creative people to think of
[44:27.440 --> 44:30.800]  wouldn't it be cool if blank like wouldn't it be cool
[44:30.800 --> 44:37.040]  if we could embed the gps data in the photo itself and then your photo
[44:37.040 --> 44:39.440]  collection you could say show me all the photos
[44:39.440 --> 44:43.360]  from when i'm in uh cozumel mexico and it'll show you
[44:43.360 --> 44:46.960]  all of the photos from your trip to cozumel mexico and if you
[44:46.960 --> 44:50.000]  broaden the gps you know even if you took like a
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.280]  a boat trip or something like that you know
[44:53.280 --> 44:57.120]  in the general vicinity you could find them all you know it's super and
[44:57.120 --> 45:00.640]  wow that would be super useful but then it's like there's all of these
[45:00.640 --> 45:04.400]  oh but and then it's like everywhere you send it
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.160]  you know where you wouldn't want your location you've got to either
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.160]  strip that data yourself which most people aren't going to do because most
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.160]  people don't even know how to do that or trust the tools and
[45:16.160 --> 45:19.920]  services you're using to strip it for you right like
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.480]  and so i think as far as i know every popular social media site now
[45:24.480 --> 45:27.520]  automatic you know including facebook you know maybe facebook
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.680]  stores the information on their own like you submit a photo with geolocation
[45:31.680 --> 45:35.200]  and they remember it but they don't share it publicly you know and so your
[45:35.200 --> 45:39.600]  photos on instagram don't have location data by default anymore i
[45:39.600 --> 45:43.200]  think you have to add it um but it's you know you just don't think
[45:43.200 --> 45:47.280]  of stuff like that when you're just trying to make something cool
[45:47.280 --> 45:50.800]  yeah absolutely so it's that classic ian malcolm thing from drastic park where
[45:50.800 --> 45:53.040]  you're just so busy trying to figure out how to do it you never stop and
[45:53.040 --> 45:57.120]  think about whether you should or not right or whether somebody you know
[45:57.120 --> 46:00.160]  making those dinosaurs is probably a bad idea in general but
[46:00.160 --> 46:04.320]  yes uh you know you just don't think of it often don't think of all the
[46:04.320 --> 46:08.400]  trade-offs and it seems like with air tags it's a
[46:08.400 --> 46:11.760]  case where apple really tried to and i think
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.160]  did a good job of anticipating all of the nefarious
[46:16.160 --> 46:21.040]  ways they could be used and it's just a matter of filling in the
[46:21.040 --> 46:24.480]  cracks in their implementation of those plans
[46:24.480 --> 46:27.440]  that that that they're you know that they
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.040]  couldn't quite anticipate and it'd be kind of nice if we if the
[46:31.040 --> 46:33.680]  media bent some of their will onto getting the other companies like
[46:33.680 --> 46:38.720]  tile and samsung to to implement similar protections i think the most
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.000]  recent thing they did is just turn on a bluetooth scanner so you can
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.800]  see if there's like a bluetooth device around you which is better than nothing
[46:44.800 --> 46:48.960]  but not quite so helpful i would personally love it if at an os
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.160]  level both ios and android built in something that would detect
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.600]  persistent unregistered bluetooth devices because
[46:55.600 --> 46:58.000]  like you it goes beyond tile like i said like
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.480]  people for years have been dropping cheap phones in people's bags but they
[47:00.480 --> 47:02.720]  could also you could drop your like air pods or
[47:02.720 --> 47:05.440]  samsung buds or google buds or what a cheap anchor buds or
[47:05.440 --> 47:09.040]  something that has any sort of location availability on them and follow people
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.160]  so just have it at an os level you don't need a specific phone or app
[47:12.160 --> 47:14.640]  and it just alerts you when something has been with you for a while that your
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.560]  phone doesn't know yeah it would be good i mean you know
[47:18.560 --> 47:20.720]  something like that you know something so you could like
[47:20.720 --> 47:23.280]  just sweep the area you know what i mean like
[47:23.280 --> 47:26.960]  all of a sudden we're all we're all gangsters or cia agents
[47:26.960 --> 47:31.600]  it's obsec just good obsec yeah we're sweeping sweeping for bugs
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.560]  kind of need it don't talk yet don't talk yet bb bb bb okay it's safe
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.560]  uh all right let me take another break here and thank our second and final
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.120]  sponsor of this episode our good friends at
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.400]  memberful memberful is where you can monetize

[48:08.480 --> 48:14.000]  private podcasts and tons more they seamlessly integrate with the tools you
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.040]  already use like wordpress and mailing list software and anything else you can
[48:19.040 --> 48:23.840]  think of they really do um and you keep full control and
[48:23.840 --> 48:27.920]  ownership of your audience your brand and your

[49:18.480 --> 49:25.680]  free visit memberful.com talk show today to get started that url
[49:25.680 --> 49:33.040]  is memberful.com talk show all right rumors
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.720]  here's the first one i got the uh some but some poor
[49:36.720 --> 49:40.000]  some poor engineer at apple checked in like a
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.080]  uh like a software update with the the name reality
[49:44.080 --> 49:47.680]  oh you know like a version control with uh
[49:47.680 --> 49:54.000]  like a comment or something like an if statement like if reality os
[49:54.000 --> 49:58.320]  that's not new i mean i don't think anybody really reported it as new
[49:58.320 --> 50:01.520]  but i think you i think you're the first person i heard mention the name
[50:01.520 --> 50:05.200]  and i think like two years ago i mean and again
[50:05.200 --> 50:08.560]  it's possible you know i mean it would be a you know it's the sort of thing
[50:08.560 --> 50:12.640]  where like you know it greg jaswiak decides you
[50:12.640 --> 50:14.800]  know we're not going to call it reality os
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.000]  yes some poor engineer has to go through and change on
[50:18.000 --> 50:22.320]  all of the code to to change that or maybe not maybe the code just keeps
[50:22.320 --> 50:25.840]  calling it reality os even if the actual marketing
[50:25.840 --> 50:28.800]  name of the os is something different yeah that's the
[50:28.800 --> 50:31.840]  weird thing to me and i think mark erman has been reporting on ros for a long
[50:31.840 --> 50:35.120]  time but the like usually apple doesn't use
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.520]  product names in this stuff like famously like ios was purple and there
[50:39.520 --> 50:42.880]  was purple restore and everything like they didn't like
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.960]  we're not gonna forget like we're not gonna put the new
[50:44.960 --> 50:47.680]  version of ios on this we've got the purple restore and
[50:47.680 --> 50:50.960]  someone in apple to this day like they don't know what ios
[50:50.960 --> 50:54.320]  15 is like they barely remember because they're they're using whatever the ski
[50:54.320 --> 50:56.960]  slope name or now i forget what it is like ucon or
[50:56.960 --> 50:59.280]  something yeah they live on those names and they don't
[50:59.280 --> 51:01.920]  often remember which version is which like what's in public
[51:01.920 --> 51:05.040]  they're living like two years in the future so to me like if this was like
[51:05.040 --> 51:08.480]  orange or if it was like cantaloupe or something marzipan
[51:08.480 --> 51:11.360]  that would make a lot more sense to me than to them have anything close to a
[51:11.360 --> 51:14.880]  marketing name in a in a commit yeah but somehow it seems like
[51:14.880 --> 51:17.520]  that's you know i wouldn't be surprised but i i would
[51:17.520 --> 51:20.240]  bet i would bet a small amount of money that the
[51:20.240 --> 51:23.600]  actual name of the os is going to be reality os but
[51:23.600 --> 51:28.960]  you know we shall see but is is it really you know is it news that they're
[51:28.960 --> 51:34.080]  working on this i mean it it would be i i just wrote about
[51:34.080 --> 51:37.200]  uh before we started recording today about
[51:37.200 --> 51:41.200]  a leaked slide from intel that says they have plans to be
[51:41.200 --> 51:45.600]  performance per watt competitive with the m1 pro by the end of 2023
[51:45.600 --> 51:48.800]  and like i wrote it would be it would be more shocking if you knew everything
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.400]  there was to know about intel's internal roadmap it would what would be shocking
[51:52.400 --> 51:56.160]  is if they didn't have some sort of team and a plan to do
[51:56.160 --> 51:58.560]  that now whether they'll achieve it or not
[51:58.560 --> 52:03.600]  who knows but you know it the bar's been set so fascinating
[52:03.600 --> 52:06.560]  because like they announced they publicly announced at their investor
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.240]  event which went on for like four hours like some people think wwc is long this
[52:10.240 --> 52:13.760]  was an investor event went on for four hours they announced
[52:13.760 --> 52:17.120]  four process i think it was five process shrinks for four years
[52:17.120 --> 52:20.320]  including going beyond nanometer and into angstrom because it's smaller than
[52:20.320 --> 52:23.040]  nanometer and those are just marketing names they're not actual physical
[52:23.040 --> 52:26.080]  measurements so you can't compare the sizes directly
[52:26.080 --> 52:28.880]  but at this point it's just like shut up and
[52:28.880 --> 52:31.920]  ship and it reminds me that apple doesn't do this they don't announce what
[52:31.920 --> 52:35.120]  the next four generations of apple silicon are going to be they just
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.000]  come out and show you what they've done and then let you benchmark it to see if
[52:38.000 --> 52:41.840]  if it holds up i had i had a friend who no longer works
[52:41.840 --> 52:47.280]  at apple but was there for you know a number of years as a software engineer
[52:47.280 --> 52:50.640]  and they uh they sent me that link to the leak of
[52:50.640 --> 52:55.600]  reality os and said that they they had been in a position before
[52:55.600 --> 52:58.720]  and so many apple engineers are where you're
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.640]  you're privy to something upcoming and you're trying to write
[53:02.640 --> 53:06.320]  code that's as clear and descriptive as possible
[53:06.320 --> 53:10.640]  but you you know you don't want to check anything into the shipping version
[53:10.640 --> 53:15.600]  of whatever it is that has you know that's there for like gee
[53:15.600 --> 53:18.880]  rambo to decompile or something like that and oh there's the thing that's
[53:18.880 --> 53:21.760]  happened right and he said it is like there is
[53:21.760 --> 53:24.880]  there's just nobody's going you know maybe someday
[53:24.880 --> 53:28.400]  if anybody were going to do it and like build it in as a first class feature of
[53:28.400 --> 53:31.440]  xcode i guess it would be apple but that it's
[53:31.440 --> 53:34.960]  really just sort of like you're just making like a house of cards
[53:34.960 --> 53:38.720]  of like you know ifdef statements to like make sure that
[53:38.720 --> 53:43.040]  when you compile this for that version it doesn't include any
[53:43.040 --> 53:47.040]  of this and when you compile it for the upcoming
[53:47.040 --> 53:51.120]  secret project thing it is there and that it's just so
[53:51.120 --> 53:54.400]  easy to make a mistake you know especially
[53:54.400 --> 53:59.280]  it's so easy if there's you know 500 engineers working on this
[53:59.280 --> 54:03.520]  and they have a 99.9 success rate at keeping
[54:03.520 --> 54:07.840]  things that aren't supposed to be mentioned in the shipping product out
[54:07.840 --> 54:14.640]  well you know that one in a thousand mistake it's going to happen right
[54:14.640 --> 54:18.160]  it's every couple years yeah every couple years but it's you know
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.400]  it's like somebody had a bad day and again it's not like apple apple is not
[54:22.400 --> 54:26.000]  i don't even think back when steve jobs was around it's not like
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.640]  you know he he had a reputation as a tyrant but i don't think that he was
[54:30.640 --> 54:35.120]  vindictive and like hunted down individual engineers who
[54:35.120 --> 54:39.760]  made a mistake i think famously that the poor kid who lost the iphone 4
[54:39.760 --> 54:44.640]  at a at a at a restaurant and was found by gizmodo i'm pretty sure that the kid
[54:44.640 --> 54:49.600]  did not lose his job no because of that but
[54:49.600 --> 54:54.000]  had had a bad couple of weeks right it's certainly a bad
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.440]  certainly had a bad day
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.200]  absolutely so it's not like oh the poor engineer who checked in
[55:01.200 --> 55:05.440]  a code commit with reality os mentioned but didn't comment it out or
[55:05.440 --> 55:09.200]  if if def it out so that it wouldn't be in the thing not like they're fired
[55:09.200 --> 55:12.720]  but still it's a bad day and you feel like you let everybody down and it's like
[55:12.720 --> 55:15.680]  ah and i'm sure it was the silliest possible
[55:15.680 --> 55:18.320]  mistake you know like oh i know exactly what i
[55:18.320 --> 55:20.640]  did and they look at xco and it's like you know
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.160]  you make two quick changes and all of a sudden it's you know back to
[55:24.160 --> 55:28.800]  back to hidden uh yeah yeah well to your point i mean for years blogs every
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.400]  every november would say oh we discovered in our logs people from
[55:32.400 --> 55:35.120]  cupartino are browsing our site in the next version of ios
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.480]  apple must be working on another version of ios or apple is working on a new
[55:38.480 --> 55:40.720]  iphone it's like no they've had enough they're done with the
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.040]  iphone they're based they're just dropping it they're gonna get into hot
[55:43.040 --> 55:45.600]  tubs now it's gonna be yosiri bubbles for the next
[55:45.600 --> 55:49.440]  three years yeah we just like we used to get the screen dimensions
[55:49.440 --> 55:52.640]  from that right because you could you know a lot of a lot of analytics
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.200]  packages for websites will do a test to see what the display
[55:57.200 --> 56:00.640]  size is and if you get a user agent string that says it's an
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.200]  iphone and the screen dimensions are not
[56:05.200 --> 56:08.480]  what the existing iphones have it's like oh
[56:08.480 --> 56:12.160]  new screen you know you know people would start spoofing them and like you
[56:12.160 --> 56:17.040]  can't tell it's just it's hilarious uh i remember for a while mark german
[56:17.040 --> 56:19.840]  was getting the names of new iphone models from the strings it was like
[56:19.840 --> 56:22.720]  iphone like seven comma eight and at one point apple just put
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.480]  32 numbers in there to play with them it was just hilarious like iphone one comma
[56:26.480 --> 56:31.520]  hamburger or something um i don't think though speaking of
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.920]  reality os i don't think any of that is imminent
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.440]  you know uh the german report was that maybe they were
[56:37.440 --> 56:40.720]  hoping to ship the first headset this fall
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.400]  maybe it's early next year now maybe it's been pushed back it's not
[56:44.400 --> 56:47.680]  this is not something we're talking about for this march 8th event that is
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.240]  supposedly forthcoming um yep wouldn't be surprised i think one
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.320]  thing that gets unremarked upon because they do it so seldom they're so seldom
[56:56.320 --> 56:59.760]  a new product and i think you just talked talked about this
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.240]  in one of your videos about how the one exception to apple not talking about
[57:04.240 --> 57:07.040]  future products is they'll they'll be surprisingly loose
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.760]  lipped about new products because they they don't risk cannibalizing
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.360]  themselves right so like famously tim cook answered
[57:15.360 --> 57:18.400]  like hey you guys making a watch and he said well the wrist is an
[57:18.400 --> 57:22.160]  interesting spot for us you know which you think whoa whoa william
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.080]  said the car is the ultimate mobile device
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.080]  right right right and it's like well wait why would he do that well it's
[57:28.080 --> 57:31.120]  because if he if it what's the worst thing that
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.880]  could happen you know like if he started talking up uh you
[57:34.880 --> 57:39.280]  know then this year's iphone 14 models you know the
[57:39.280 --> 57:42.800]  idea is that you would uh what's the famous example the
[57:42.800 --> 57:45.360]  osborn the osborn effect right the osborn effect
[57:45.360 --> 57:49.680]  from the early early early pc era of like the early 1980s where this poor
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.640]  company osborn was selling personal computers with
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.720]  some degree of success and went to a like a big convention and
[57:56.720 --> 57:59.280]  all they could do is talk up their next one
[57:59.280 --> 58:01.920]  and everybody stopped buying the one they were already selling and then the
[58:01.920 --> 58:04.880]  next one was late and they went out of business
[58:04.880 --> 58:10.240]  yeah uh so you don't want to apple is doesn't want to talk up
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.600]  this september's new iphones because they're still selling
[58:13.600 --> 58:16.880]  last september's iphone 13 models and you know all the ones
[58:16.880 --> 58:20.720]  underneath it in the in the product chain whereas talking about
[58:20.720 --> 58:24.080]  the watch before they were selling any watches
[58:24.080 --> 58:27.760]  didn't hurt them you know if anything it only kept people
[58:27.760 --> 58:30.880]  yeah hurts or fitbit or you know whatever whatever it is you think
[58:30.880 --> 58:34.960]  they're going to do um so the other thing is like the
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.840]  technology is like tim cook has been very happy to talk about
[58:37.840 --> 58:42.880]  automation and uh augmented reality and artificial intelligence because those
[58:42.880 --> 58:46.560]  aren't actual products it's like steve jobs talking about lcd
[58:46.560 --> 58:49.920]  like yes the i the imac has to go lcd eventually but
[58:49.920 --> 58:53.680]  if there is no lcd that you literally can't make an iphone but then lcd isn't
[58:53.680 --> 58:56.080]  the iphone because you also make the ipad and the watch
[58:56.080 --> 59:00.000]  and i think cook is the same it's like ar and vr there will be products that
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.280]  use those but it's going to be as ubiquitous as lcd and oled are on
[59:03.280 --> 59:06.720]  products today yeah and i i think it's really
[59:06.720 --> 59:10.720]  interesting as time goes on there's two big
[59:10.720 --> 59:14.160]  upcoming who knows you know whether either both
[59:14.160 --> 59:17.360]  or will ship or on what form but that there's project titan at apple where
[59:17.360 --> 59:20.800]  they're making a car or some kind of vehicle or
[59:20.800 --> 59:23.840]  self-driving technology or something along the lines of a
[59:23.840 --> 59:30.800]  car vehicle and the ar vr stuff where they're either making uh
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.800]  i mean vr at a technical level is clearly closer to reality
[59:34.800 --> 59:38.240]  than ar yeah but it could be a mixed thing
[59:38.240 --> 59:43.280]  where it is a technically a vr headset but it combines a camera so you can see
[59:43.280 --> 59:46.560]  through and see the world around you not just
[59:46.560 --> 59:49.440]  what's you know you're not just in a total blackout
[59:49.440 --> 59:53.680]  and that eventually they do want to make ar glasses you know where you
[59:53.680 --> 59:56.720]  you'll get effectively like eyeglasses but then
[59:56.720 --> 59:59.920]  you know you'll have like a heads-up display and your lenses are projected
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.120]  onto your retinas or whatever the technology they want to use
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.160]  to me one of the interesting contrasts between those two
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.600]  big initiatives right the ar vr stuff on one side
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.040]  project titan on the other is that project titan
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.600]  has been we know just through leaks and just through
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.880]  uh the public exodus and return of executives right like some
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.280]  of this stuff can't you know we don't know what they're working on but
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.720]  all sorts of people have come and gone from project titan and
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.480]  come from tesla left from tesla gone back
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.120]  come from qnx right there's all sorts of the drama and shake ups
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:46.080]  and stuff like that and the ar xr vr stuff it's just seemingly at least as
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.320]  far as we know from the outside steady as she goes right it's still mike
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.120]  rockwell heading it up uh you know and hasn't been a lot of news
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.920]  you know it was just a couple years ago where rockwell
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.560]  was on my show at wwc after a bunch of vr
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.480]  and ar specific apis that were announced that year for
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.560]  ios he's still there it's it's seemingly where there's smoke there's fire it
[01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.040]  seems like there's been a lot of fires at project titan
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.400]  seems like everything's going pretty well with the ar vr stuff but
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.280]  i wouldn't be surprised sign of our time it's like the reporting is way more
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.520]  active than it was now and i've talked about this before but
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.320]  like can you imagine if this kind of reporting was done back during the
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.520]  iphone era where it's like steve jobs wants a glass device that he
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.200]  can read email anywhere tablet project now becomes iphone project
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.720]  tony fidel and scott forestall in blood war for steve jobs's affection
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.560]  right now project purple delayed room smell like pizza like
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.080]  like the whole thing would have been like much more like
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.240]  i feel like that's what we get with titan now is that everything we never
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.280]  used to hear about until they shipped like there'd be rumors and stuff but now
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.920]  like every little personnel move is is broadcast for various reasons i i'm
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.480]  actually researching a lot about the creation of the
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.840]  the iphone the original iphone product and
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.440]  i've cracked open a bunch of my books that i've collected
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:06.160]  over the years and you know that i read for the most part when they came out
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.400]  things like becoming steve jobs which was the other biography of of
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.640]  steve jobs ken kashenda's creative selection kurt
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.480]  i think his name is kurt vogelstein's i forget the title of his book i can't
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.120]  believe it it's on my it's on my desk as i speak
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:26.880]  but it was like about the creation of ios and android
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.040]  i'm just reading a bunch of these and well fred vogelstein what's the name of
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:35.840]  the book do you have it no i can't find it hold on fred
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.240]  vogelstein up got it dogfight is the book it's a very
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.240]  good yeah yeah with the android stuff it's amazing
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.520]  yeah it's it's uh can't believe i couldn't think of it but anyway good
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:50.480]  book anyway but i i'm like
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.440]  trying to figure out the the timeline of the creation of the iphone which i
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.640]  don't think i've ever seen quite spelled out
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.920]  combined with like the rocker and stuff and
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.120]  the one thing and it so it's like i'm sort of like
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.160]  the the guy at the the cork board with a bunch of tacks and yarn
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.080]  yeah and i'm stringing all this stuff all around and i've got all these books
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.280]  with like three four or five bookmarks each in
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.960]  all of them and a bunch of older articles from the era and blah blah blah
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:24.240]  and the one thing that where i'm going with this is the one thing that keeps
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.080]  coming up over and over again to a surprising degree
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.040]  is that steve jobs wanted something that he could read his email on the toilet
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.040]  and yeah i think imram imram tweeted that a while ago too
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.520]  yeah the uh the founder of humane the secretive startup yes
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  uh yeah uh yeah great computer history museum has a whole bunch of interviews
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.760]  with scott forestall and indanatra and just
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.080]  um so many of the people who like built all that stuff like why they named it ui
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.040]  kit it's it's amazing amazing lore i don't
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.760]  know that i don't know the story of why they named it ui kit
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.640]  it's other than the fact oh it was it is yeah i'm blanking on his name now scott
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.280]  it was scott hearse who came up with the name eventually because it wasn't
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.640]  abkit and it wasn't uh webkit right right
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:13.280]  it's a good name um but it's so funny because you read these things and there
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.360]  are conflicting reports you go through and there's a lot of you know you kind
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.560]  of have to start making some editorial just if you want to say this is what i
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.800]  think the timeline is what happened in early 2005 what
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.840]  happened in late 2005 when was this bake-off between like an
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.760]  embedded linux versus a stripped down mac os 10 to be the iphone os
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.800]  yeah um and you get conflicting reports about
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.720]  what was early 2005 what was late 2005 what was the middle
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.400]  what might have even been in early 2006 like within
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.920]  you know like 11 10 months you know the clock is ticking to where
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.760]  where where they want to announce this at macworld 2007
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.040]  but there's other things that come up over and over and over again from the
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.640]  various sources both like books that came out years
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.400]  later extemporaneous stories and the one thing that keeps coming up
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.240]  is that steve jobs wanted to read email on the toilet
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.200]  yeah i just love it you just know that there was that and this
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.880]  the story of steve his wife having her friend over who had the husband from
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.960]  microsoft who was talking about how bill gates and
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.480]  tablet pcs were going to dominate the future of computing and then steve goes
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:24.720]  and finds scott the next day and we have to put a stop to this yeah
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:31.600]  screw him yeah uh so anyway i wouldn't be surprised if
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.120]  if reality os follows the pattern that watch
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:41.440]  the apple watch did where they announce it this fall at
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:45.040]  you know maybe alongside the iphone which is usually the bigger event
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.320]  in september but say this is a product here's the product we're making
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.120]  here's what it does here's what it's good for
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.000]  and it's coming early next year and that's what they did with the watch
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.040]  back in 2015 2014 whenever it was 2014 yeah 2014
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.080]  would be the announcement 2015 is when the original apple watch shipped like in
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:12.400]  april and was in short supply you know until up until closer to
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.200]  wwdc like it was kind of hard to get your
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.880]  hands on one um and again they don't do that with any
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.320]  other new pride there if something terrible happened with
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.200]  the iphones 14 and they could not release them
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:31.280]  by the end of the year this year they're just not even going to announce them
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.520]  until next year and you know i mean that would be highly unusual i'm not saying
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.880]  that like hey the stock market you know like if september comes and goes and
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.960]  apple hasn't said anything about a media event
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.640]  uh you know or if they have a media event in october
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.400]  and it's there's no mention of new iphones yeah you know like
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.440]  people are going to notice and we're all going to talk about it
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.040]  but they're not going to pre-announce the iphone 14
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.400]  and say it's coming in six months whereas no
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.680]  only the first one right with a vr headset they might
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:07.120]  and in fact it might make a lot of sense right it's like you know
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.600]  it why not pre-announce it you know and then you can get developers to start
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.800]  working on stuff uh if you want them to if there's going
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.280]  to be you know a a day one app store
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.600]  sdk story like you know which they insisted on for the watch
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.200]  probably for you know you could say for better for worse i think
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:34.160]  that original watch kit was for worse um yes but presumably i think they want
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.720]  to get it like they want to be the ones who disclose it and as like when we
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.520]  talk about the rumors we'll talk about like how the different fcc's
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.360]  in the different countries pre-announce stuff way early for them all the time
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.480]  but it never the first one so like the original apple tv was
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.320]  or itv back then was announced and then like it actually debuted with alongside
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.880]  the original iphone but then the original iphone was announced
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:57.440]  in january shipped in june ipad was announced in january shipped in april
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.960]  apple watch was announced in september switched shipped in march it's just
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.560]  they don't ever want that to be in the fcc right and you know go back to the
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.480]  iphone right we were just talking about the original iphone announced in january
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.160]  definitely not finished famously and you know when you talk to people who worked
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.760]  on it there was like yeah that was like the hardest part was after it was
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.000]  announced and we had to finish the damn thing
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.480]  uh but didn't ship until literally six months later the like june 29th
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.720]  uh 2007 but the same thing where they don't have to submit to the regulatory
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.960]  bodies and don't have to worry about it leaking
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.160]  so if they're on pace for it to ship in early 2023
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.000]  like a year from now let you know more or less uh
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.400]  it would actually to me be almost surprising if they don't
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.240]  announce it in september a little bit surprising
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.480]  just because it you know and then you know and and and if for competitive
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:57.200]  reasons it inspires some number of people not to buy an
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.600]  oculus for christmas because they want to wait
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.680]  for apples thing well that you know i'm sure that'll just break poor tim
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.800]  cook's heart you know yeah it'll pivot his tables
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.600]  so anyway what is coming march 8th i i have not heard anything i'm not juiced
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.160]  in i don't ask anybody i don't know i know
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.240]  all i do is i just listen to mark german and mark german says march 8th
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.360]  we know that apple likes to have a spring event uh
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.680]  march 8th is a tuesday that sounds as good as as anything to me i do think
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.640]  that's earlier it is an earlier dates than usual
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.440]  for them um i just last year was april yeah well and i just know that that
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.640]  week i don't know i haven't been to south by southwest in years but i know
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.320]  south by southwest is always right around like if not the first
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:48.000]  week of march it's like that second week of march around those dates
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.200]  and back when i was going to south by southwest i never
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.480]  it was never a conflict with apple events um yeah
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.760]  but you know if it's ready it's ready and why not um what
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:05.200]  do we expect german says the 5g iphone se which is fascinating
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.600]  a new ipad air and he says at least one new mac that day but doesn't say what it
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.320]  would be so let's take them one at a time what
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.040]  number one do you think that's a do you think that's a good list of things that
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:19.680]  they might announce early early in march yeah and we've
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.480]  talked about this before it's always odd to me when you have sources good enough
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.920]  to tell you dates and products but not exactly not more
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.000]  specifically because this stuff was decided
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.520]  like those products were decided years ago and the release dates were decided
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.240]  weeks if not months ago so like all this stuff is known it's
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.480]  just fascinating to me how much of it gets out
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.680]  well and the mac one in particular right because he's pretty specific about the
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.920]  other two you know a 5g new iphone se that's pretty specific a
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.400]  new ipad air i mean and again we don't know the
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.800]  details i mean maybe is it going to have face id now just face id trickle down to
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.720]  the non-pro ipads i mean but he doesn't say but that's you know we know what the
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.400]  ipad air is it's it's apple's mid-range you know not
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.520]  the low one not the pro one but it's sort of the
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.720]  goldilocks yeah the goldilocks sweet one right in the middle
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.000]  and then some sort of mac well we're waiting yes we're
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.040]  that and that's the worst part for me because i'm more excited about the mac
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.680]  than the other products and it's like i need to know i want to
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.440]  know which one it is am i should i start getting excited to get a new i mac i
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.360]  mean what's what's going on the the 5g iphone se is interesting
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.480]  because 5g makes sense because you know the
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.080]  carriers love getting all the phones on on the
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.880]  new network yes um you know and they're turning you
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.880]  know literally as we speak 18 t i think just this week i think they
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.760]  already did it turned off their 3g network
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:44.720]  we had to deal with that because our home alarm system was on 3g
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.800]  and and uh you know but we had plenty of notice
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.960]  from the company that we use that we you know that hey this is
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.080]  you know this is going to be end of end of serviced and
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.440]  you know it's part of your plan would you just have to schedule somebody to
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.200]  come in to upgrade you know the box on the wall to support
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.320]  5g or 4g i don't even know what they upgrade hopefully it was five i should
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.960]  have asked because 5g would give us more years before the 4g stuff gets
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.200]  turned off um so it makes sense i mean and if you
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.760]  watch tv like i watch sports and there's all
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.360]  you know you cannot can't watch sports without seeing ads for cell phones from
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.040]  the carriers and all the they always talk about 5g
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.960]  5g 5g i mean that's famously two years ago at the
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.280]  iphone supercut 5g 5g 5g 5g 5 yeah 5g iphone
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.800]  yeah 12 supports 5g 5g um so it makes sense you know that they'd
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.320]  want to get the se on there but to me the more interesting thing is that
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.200]  the rumors are that the se would uh will otherwise still look like the se we have
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.200]  today that's the iphone 8 casing right with
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.440]  the home button with yeah perhaps only in one size you
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.160]  know because that would be the other thing that would you know 5g to me is
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:07.040]  not a game changer and especially compared to lte
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.560]  and yeah upload speeds still are over lte so like when you do like a speed
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.560]  test don't be surprised that your 5g speed for upload is exactly the same as
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.480]  it is when you turn off 5g because it actually doesn't use 5g for anything but
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.040]  downloading um and i just i still
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.400]  after two two years of 5g i still you know
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.160]  it might be maybe it's better as years go by it'll be more efficient
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.400]  and better on battery and stuff like that but i still don't know any use case
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:43.200]  where i want to do blank but uh lte geez you know too slow
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.200]  you know it's it is yeah it's more like um you're gonna get people who are on
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.200]  the original iphone se sorry like the iphone se 2 onto a
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.080]  qualcomm modem and for some people especially in edge areas the
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.440]  intel modems were never as good if you had low reception or low
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.280]  signal in those areas so it's just it's it's a better modem
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:05.280]  and for people who were underserved by lte like especially in rural areas
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.640]  where they just never had maybe any signal or good signal
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.840]  the low band of 5g is slower than lte but it's got
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.720]  way way better coverage and the mid band is faster and has roughly as good
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.600]  coverage so for people who always had problems with
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.880]  lte it's going to be it's going to vastly improve a lot of
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:26.880]  people's experience yeah so you know that's good right i i think
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:30.240]  i think what's more interesting is that they're they're keeping
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:37.200]  the se models on that old industrial design um and
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.760]  the cynical take would be that it is market differentiation it's sort of like
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.600]  keeping the iphone or the apple watch 3 around
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.880]  right where it's a little bit clunkier looking on your wrist and it
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.240]  certainly has a clunkier screen with the the
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.520]  non-rounded corners and doesn't really go edge to edge
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:02.160]  and it you know gets customers in the door looking for the se for the price
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:05.920]  and then they see how much cooler the new phones are and then they buy one of
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.840]  those more expensive newer phones instead but i think there's
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.000]  something else i think that it is apple trying to and i
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.560]  don't know how much of this is their gut feeling
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.120]  you know jaws's gut feeling and how much of it is actual market
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.280]  research which i think at the stakes they're playing at you know
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.520]  apple famously people think they don't test anything but they that's not true
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.000]  they do they do test things you know they just don't make the decisions based
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.640]  entirely on the results of asking you know doing like uh consumer
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.240]  surveys and stuff like that yeah but i think there's got to be a huge
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.040]  factor of the iphone is so popular as so many
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.720]  hundreds of millions of users that it spans the gamut
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:56.400]  from the people like us who are complete nerds and really couldn't wait
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.560]  to play with the brand new iphone 10 and this new interaction model
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:06.560]  to people like my mom and dad well my dad hardly uses the iphone so i'm
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.040]  throwing my mom out here not because of the canard that it's the
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.320]  you know it's your mom who doesn't understand technology but my dad
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.240]  literally doesn't even he uses an ipad but for whatever reason won't use my
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:22.640]  mom's iphone but my mom wanted the se when she got a
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.240]  new phone a year ago or so because she wanted one that worked
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.920]  exactly like her old phone that she felt like she'd mastered the old
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.080]  one she wanted a home button she just was and i was like okay fine this is a
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.320]  probably a great phone for you anyway person you know
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.920]  regardless but i i don't know what number of iphone users
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.400]  are in that sphere where they they would prefer price aside they want
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.640]  one with a home button that works just like the one they had
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.240]  and that apple and the options are good and like apple family like you're right
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:58.880]  like they they don't do the same kind of market uh
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.920]  research that other companies do but they do a lot of demand forecasting and
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.480]  try to figure out because like compared to samsung for
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.760]  example they sell very very few phones and it looks like they sell a lot of
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.520]  phones now because there's five models but
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:13.040]  still five miles is like what samsung has for lunch and so they have to make
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.120]  sure that those phones cover as wide a gamut of potential users as
[01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:19.280]  possible those segments are really really large
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.480]  and they're interesting like the original iphone se was both small and
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.800]  cheap and they got the benefit of both those markets
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.680]  and i think they were surprised by how many people just wanted the cheaper
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.080]  iphone so much so that they they under they
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.280]  under report the under forecast on it but then they had a
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.880]  separate iphone mini and a separate iphone se in 2020
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.160]  and they could sort of suss out where people's interests were and i think that
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.280]  was really informative for them and in general that
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.120]  the the original se came out in 2016 se2 came out in 2020
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:53.920]  which means se3 would probably be 2024 in an iphone 11 style casing
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.600]  but because we're only halfway there i think otherwise they wouldn't update it
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.480]  now they would just keep it on the market the way the original se was
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:04.160]  but 5g is so important to carriers and how they're moving things over
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.400]  um and apple has this other strategy where like the like the ipod touch is
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.240]  probably the most infamous example but it's
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.680]  the device you love with new internal so that you can keep on loving it
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.040]  just a little while longer you know before we end of life it
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.960]  this this will get unlike the apple watch s apple watch 3 which
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.000]  didn't get any improvements like they just kept it on the market this will
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.320]  have a new processor it'll have better camera it'll have a better modem
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.280]  i'm worried about the battery life because it was already not good
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.640]  on the se2 and that has way fewer demands than a new processor and a new
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.200]  modem but in general it just means it's that
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.600]  that really inexpensive entry-level iphone
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.600]  that's more useful to people who still want it yeah i think that maybe
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.120]  but i think if they follow the pattern of previous
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:53.200]  se's it will have the a a what are we up to a14 what's the
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.720]  bionic well a15 it is the current one is 15 a15 all
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.200]  right so we're we're two above the iphone model
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.000]  i i would expect it to have the a15 because that's the se's have always come
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.640]  out with like you know they come out in march or april but they've got
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.960]  the top of the line a series chip from six months prior
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.880]  and the battery life gains from the a14 to a15 my favorite example i've
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.240]  never stopped repeating it is that the iphone 13
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.760]  mini gets better longer battery life than yes
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:32.320]  the full size regular size iphone 12 from the year before so yeah you know
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.960]  so that would also explain to me why they didn't do the 5g iphone se last
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.000]  year right that now is the year where it all
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.200]  adds up the battery life story is resolved um because it would be a
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:49.280]  bigger device than the iphone 13 mini
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.520]  so i i would think battery life would be fine even with the 5g and the new modem
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.000]  is more efficient than the iphone 12 was as well
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.640]  it's just a whole in general and this will come up again we talk about the
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.640]  next macbook air but that architecture the a15 is a much cooler architecture in
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.240]  general yeah yeah it def it's you know it's been
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.280]  proven over the last you know what five months
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.480]  since we've been using them four months whatever
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.880]  but the other thing that's that's missing in the se lineup right the se is
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.520]  clearly built on the the physical form factor
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:28.480]  of the iphone six seven eight iphones yeah but those phones all came
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.240]  in regular and plus sizes and the iphone se
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:36.000]  that we have is only in the regular size not plus
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.920]  and i think according to the rumors but who knows you know they
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.640]  could surprise us but it sounds like that's just they're just going to
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.680]  replace the same size four point whatever inch you know uh
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.920]  or whatever that size is but it's you know not the plus
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:57.680]  not the plus size screen which some people would obviously buy
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.680]  right some people we now know just want bigger screens whether it's the laptop
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:06.160]  yes yeah tablet or the phone and there
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.280]  if they still don't come out with an iphone se plus
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.880]  to me that's that's product marketing saying if you want a big if you would
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:19.040]  like a big screen iphone you've got to upgrade to one of these more expensive
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.360]  models with the newer form factor yeah it's that and it's also there's
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.640]  some element of demand forecasting again because like when they segment
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.240]  you have to supply two like it's like i'm running the math
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.680]  doing the doing the math and like how much does it cost us to put two mark two
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.920]  phones in the market how many of each do we think we'll
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.040]  sell how much more does it cost us to have two models instead of one
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.400]  if we just sold one would we get 75 of the se customers anyway
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.360]  so it really doesn't behoove us to have it like in an ideal world they would
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:48.160]  absolutely do not like like samsung again with every
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.880]  quarter inch of sizing for whatever your preference is
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.920]  but they would do multiple products i just think they
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.480]  um they they know they don't want to over commit to any one market anymore
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.920]  they want to they're going to be more conservative in how they do especially
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.560]  the lower end entry level where really price is the
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.840]  most important feature for people yeah there's been reports that they were
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.160]  working on it for years but that they keep canceling it like
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.440]  there were reports about the se plus i think going back to three years already
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:18.000]  yeah yeah i'd uh i definitely remember seeing rumors about it and it
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.280]  makes logical sense you know to have it but it's it to me it leads to the next
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.240]  segment which is the mystery which mac are are they which mac or max are they
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.520]  going to announce next month which to me is the
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.360]  the the biggest missing mac in the lineup
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:43.600]  by far is a bigger consumer priced macbook right like
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:50.720]  so the macbook pros are now on 14 inch 16 inch but with foot
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.840]  or with footprints that are very very similar
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.320]  to 13 inch 15 inch from years past it's just that the screen sizes
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.520]  have gained an inch by going edge to edge
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.960]  and you know some minor tweaks to the footprints but
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:10.560]  you know it in in ballpark descriptive terms i would describe
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:17.360]  the 14 inch macbook pro and the macbook air
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:21.920]  of today which is the 13 inch screen as regular sized
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:28.800]  laptops and the uh 16 inch macbook pro as a big laptop not the biggest you
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:31.600]  know apple used to make the 17 inch lunch tray
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:36.400]  the battleship right which i i actually was just looking up like i said
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:43.520]  my trip down memory lane of circuit 2005 6 7 apple history steve jobs when
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.960]  he had his first surgery uh and announced that you know he'd had
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:52.480]  his pancreas operated on for cancer wrote a letter to the company you know
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.320]  saying team i wanted you to hear this from me
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.160]  i've you know the doctors found this thing and they i just had operation i'm
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.600]  writing this from my hospital bed on my 17 inch
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.200]  macbook pro and it was because like he knew it was
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.040]  going to leak and he was like well he had to mention
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.120]  he had to mention an apple product in there
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.960]  and i always wondered was he really writing it on a 17 inch macbook pro or
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:19.520]  was it that's just the newest thing that he
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.160]  wanted to promote and he said he did i mean i'm not
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.760]  accusing steve jobs of being a liar but he could be an exaggerator
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.080]  but it also seems like prototype ipad he couldn't talk about
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.920]  but uh you know big laptop regular size laptop and you know in
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.640]  years past they've had small laptops like the
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:46.160]  uh long ago uh 11 inch macbook airs and then the gone but not forgotten
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:49.920]  just plain no adjective 12 inch macbook um
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.600]  you know small medium large some products i i think when apple is
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.760]  has a product at its best they either have
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:01.840]  two sizes an apple watch is a perfect example of that right and putting aside
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.360]  the idea that there might be a rugged apple watch or something like that
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.720]  you know for the apple watch as we know it two sizes seems just
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.160]  just right i think for the phone i really
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.520]  like you know and i know the rumors say there's no more mini and
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:21.760]  whatever but i i like the mini regular max sizing and i feel like that really
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:26.800]  is a phone for everybody laptops i kind of wish there they had
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:32.480]  mini regular max um but even if at the two tiers
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.480]  pro lap macbooks and non-pro macbooks two seems good
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:42.400]  right like 14 and 16 inch for the pros but i i feel like the biggest missing
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:45.760]  ipad for years or macbook for years has been
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.120]  a bigger consumer priced macbook whether it's called large
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.840]  screens get conflated with premium when they don't they're not really an
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.320]  overlap in those features because there are a lot of people for a lot of reasons
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.560]  who'd want a bigger screen but don't need a pro
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.600]  right device and you know it's nice to have a big screen right and
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.200]  if you have the desk space and you know you don't mind the extra
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.080]  weight in your backpack or whatever and you know lots and lots of people hardly
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.840]  ever move their macbooks from their desks you know they buy a macbook so
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.280]  that they have a portable when they need it but they
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.640]  keep it on their desk 90 some percent of the time maybe high
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.720]  90 of the time and so getting the biggest screen they
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.120]  they feel is within their budget makes a lot
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.000]  of sense because a big screen is nice and it's there even people right now who
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.400]  are concerned that the m1 imac is going to only be 24 inches and
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.120]  that if you want a 27 inch it's going to have to be an m1 pro or
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.520]  m1 max when they really just want a bigger screen again
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:46.640]  right right oh i i think i do think again no
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.920]  inside knowledge but just judging by the way
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.440]  they did the macbooks i think that's going to be the case right like
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.760]  where the only way to get a big screen macbook for years for all along has been
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.840]  to buy the macbook pro 16 inch or 15 inch back in when it was
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.680]  15 inch and it's not just paying for the bigger
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.880]  screen because the bigger macbooks have also had
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.480]  like you know sometimes faster chips and faster graphics
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.080]  and and for thermal reasons compared to the smaller versions
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:23.920]  you end up paying a significant mark uh you know minimum price like i think that
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.120]  the cheapest 16 inch macbook pro right now i think
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.920]  it's two thousand dollars 1999 yeah i guess i should look it up uh
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:35.520]  which is way more than the 999 right here it's twice the price
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:42.560]  you know whereas and it's it to me epitomizes the difference between
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.320]  the apple ecosystem and the broader windows
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:53.600]  slash linux chromebook pc ecosystem which is that whatever your budget you
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:57.440]  can find a pc laptop you know if you really want
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.320]  like a 16 inch screen but you don't want to spend a lot of money you can
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.960]  definitely find you'll you you'll be you know you'll have an arms-length list
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.920]  of choices from various companies del will let you build it from parts
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.640]  definitely right it is it and it's such i don't know so it
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.320]  are they going to deal with it it seems like there's an awful lot of
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.240]  you know with the rumors for what apple is doing with the consumer macbooks as
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.840]  they go to the m2s and do their second revision
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.360]  um you know i i talk about this this is why it's great to have a podcast because
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.160]  it's i have nothing to write about because i know nothing but i have lots
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.280]  of ideas but i don't think what it's interesting
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.240]  because like the larger macbook air mark german reported on that too but said
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.480]  that that had been either delayed or scrapped as well
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.640]  so like it's not that apple isn't thinking about it it's just that they
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:51.120]  don't seem to think that it's that they want they need to bring it to market
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:58.880]  yeah i guess uh the the to me the product that two
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.320]  products a product that doesn't make sense anymore is what's currently known
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.760]  as the 13 inch macbook pro and yes to me it's always been
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.960]  ever since it was announced as sort of in that time when we were
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.920]  waiting for a retina macbook air
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.840]  and phil shiller did the spiel and sort of said like hey
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.120]  you know if if what you're looking for is something with the footprint of a
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.040]  macbook air with a retina screen this low end
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.120]  13 inch macbook pro compares very nicely and put them up
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.160]  side by side and the price was only a couple hundred bucks more and the
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.440]  footprint is the same and the weight was very good because they'd made it
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:43.280]  thinner even though it's not teardrop shaped and it had a retina screen
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:47.040]  um but you know and what were the trade-offs compared to the more
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.880]  expensive 13 inch models well they had two ports instead of four ports and
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.080]  was you know had had yeah some sort of intel
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.600]  you know lower lower price bar which right no touch bar
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:01.040]  right right which for a lot of people was a feature there i know people
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.840]  firsthand who were torn because they would rather have the
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.000]  faster macbook pro but didn't want the touch bar and so they're like i guess
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.080]  i'll just buy the one without the touch bar
[01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.760]  to me that would clean this up quite a bit
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:17.120]  and again are they going to keep the name air it seems like
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:23.440]  macbook air has sort of stopped meaning air meaning thinner and lighter and has
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.320]  just sort of taken on it just it's like
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:29.600]  kleenex you know it it's just a brand name macbook air
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.120]  it's just people know it that's the macbook they want right
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.480]  what macbook do you want i want the air it's also become conflated with cheapest
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.280]  like the cheapest mac and that's never been the case at launch it's always
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.760]  launched it way more than 999 and then gone down to 999 but now when
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.080]  when they try to introduce new ones and they're more expensive
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:50.640]  people get really upset yeah definitely um
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.720]  and by the way i have to i i need to uh clarify this i did
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:01.120]  i did the research the 16 inch macbook pro starts at 2500
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:05.040]  not 2000 it's the fourth the 14 inch starts at two thousand dollars
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.920]  um so there's there's a lot of room in that thousand to two thousand dollar
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.440]  range for more macbooks and from people who
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:19.280]  absolutely positively or would be over served by the m1 pro and m1 max
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:25.600]  chipsets right the that that that is the the the absolute blessing of the
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.840]  tremendous performance of the current apple silicon that the regular
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:37.040]  m1 is just terrific and the m2 will be even better um they don't need it
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.720]  but there's so much room in there and calling
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:48.320]  the 1400 ish macbook the pro is to me just confusing i i i
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.480]  so i kind of hope that they go away from that and leave
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:58.880]  the pros be what we now know as the 14 and 16 inch macbook pros keep
[01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.800]  the pro name for those make them very distinctive just like
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.800]  how with the iphone the pros are so distinctive right shiny
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:11.840]  stainless steel bigger camera pro yeah
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.200]  brushed aluminum yeah smaller camera regular
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.880]  you know so there's nothing like in the old iphone x body that's called the
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.080]  iphone pro minus or something that's just a cheaper level
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:27.120]  right fake pro so i i would love to see them do with the macbooks
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.720]  even if they just did it follow the lead of the iphone
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:37.520]  right so the pros have two sizes regular 14 inch big 16 inch
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.960]  and the regular ones would have two sizes
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:47.920]  mini go back to 12 inch and regular 14 inch and and have two
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.760]  two machines like that uh and so if you really want a
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.040]  tiniest tiniest macbook that apple has ever made
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:59.520]  uh you could get the new 12 inch macbook air or whatever they would call it
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.800]  you know maybe they just call it the macbook again i don't know
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:09.040]  and if you want uh you know a mid-size macbook at a consumer price bump it up
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.760]  to 14 inches which would be a you know a nice increase from 13 uh and
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:16.400]  keep it a lower price that's what i hope they do i have no
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:20.640]  idea if that's what's in the works but it would make a lot more sense
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:27.040]  than using the names new low-end macbook pro and
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:30.800]  you know and talking about the macbook air as though it's definitely
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:35.200]  only one size because it doesn't have to be
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.720]  yeah no it's super interesting because what apple when apple does those those
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.080]  uh you know when fano snaps those bezels there's two ways it does it
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:48.480]  one is like the smaller ipad pro where they made the an 11 inch screen in the
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.200]  previous 10.5 inch enclosure and the other is like the 12.9 inch ipad pro
[01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.280]  where they just removed as much device size around it so it was the same screen
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:00.000]  size but a way smaller package and we've seen
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.440]  them do that now like the 16 inch macbook pro is just a little bit
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.280]  thinner than even the previous 16 inch model but they got a 14 inch display now
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.960]  in in the new 14 inch model and my guess is
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.360]  that the next the m2 um macbook or macbook air
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.560]  is not going to be a direct replacement for the current m1 macbook here they're
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:22.080]  going to keep that around at 999 but they're going to go back to
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.000]  what the the old macbook was and that is a premium ultralight
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.320]  model with an m2 chip and even smaller bezels so if i don't think it'll be
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.920]  12 inches but i think it'll it'll be the same physical size as the 12 inch
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.640]  it just won't have any bezels so the screen will still be like third and
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:39.920]  always 13 point something or 12 point something like it's never as rounded off
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.320]  as the marketing but it'll be a much bigger screen in
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.760]  the same size body for more money because like mini it's a
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.400]  bill of goods things mini led is expensive and
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.360]  the chipsets are going to be expensive at first and apple wants to recoup they
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:53.520]  want to pay that down as fast as possible
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:57.360]  and then they'll leave the existing m1 on the market at 999 until they can
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.600]  replace it but i think that's the same thing that's
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.160]  sort of damning that 13 inch macbook pro because the current
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.520]  one the m1 is going to it's 18 months old already it's going to be 24 months
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.040]  old by the end of the year they could put it inside they could have
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.920]  a lower end version of the 14 inch that has an m2 in it but if m2 is like
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.880]  m1 it won't have enough usbc and thunderbolt controllers
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.160]  for all those ports and it would be they'd have to like make an enclosure
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.960]  that paves over some of those ports which would be weird like they would
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.800]  totally do it but it would be weird and they also have like even though
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.560]  apple is like one of the biggest companies in the world
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.040]  they have such little bandwidth this one id team was one industrial design team
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:39.360]  and the mac team seems only able to push out you know two new macs a year
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:41.680]  and they have to pick and this year it sounds like that's going to be the
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.920]  macbook air the mac pro and a variation of the of the
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.160]  iMac and there's just not enough time or
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.640]  bandwidth to make something else so that's why i think it's it's it's
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.320]  wrong for all the wrong reasons but they're going to just slap that m2
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:01.280]  in the existing macbook pro 13 inch chassis the macbook air pro or pro air
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.560]  whatever you really want to call it and let that slide for another year and
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.880]  make that 2023's problem the other thing that's very clear from
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:13.440]  the iphone marketing is that the pro name only goes on the latest and
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:16.320]  greatest so they sell and i know that if you go
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.600]  to carriers around the world you can still get like a iphone
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.920]  10r and stuff like that but what apple will sell you
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:31.040]  is the iphone 13 pro iphone 13 regular iphone 12 regular two sizes the iphone
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:36.560]  se and the iphone 11 um pro means latest and greatest and i
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.480]  again i think that clarity would be so much better for the macbook branding
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.200]  just get rid of that low-end macbook pro and make kick-ass
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:50.400]  macbook airs that completely satisfy anybody's need who wants that
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.800]  that that you know price range of macbook totally agree
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.280]  i think the difference is with the mac market specifically since 2016
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.960]  is that apple saw that there was a large and growing group of people
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.120]  who self-identified as pros but were pros in the traditional context
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.560]  and that they were willing to give extra money just to have the pro branding so
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.880]  it became like airpods pro more than iphone pro and just making
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:18.400]  that product really swell is swelled up their sales well then let
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.600]  them spend two thousand dollars to get the 14 inch and again tim cook can
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.040]  thank us for it uh well me and you we can send we can send them a consulting
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.680]  bill you know it's it's only going to make tim
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.240]  cook uh his like you said uh pivot his tables
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.600]  yes all right perfect the other big mac that we're obviously all waiting for and
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.400]  i alluded to it is the big iMac do we think that's coming in
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:51.520]  uh which i presume will simply have the the m1 pro and max
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:57.120]  guts of the the macbook pros that were just announced at the end of last year
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:03.600]  uh in the same way that the 24 inch iMac had the same m1 guts as
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:11.440]  the first round of m1 macbooks and the mac mini from 2020
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:18.720]  2020 um yeah do we think it's coming in early march i don't think so i think the
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.760]  there was three max that were registered in the and i'm blanking on which version
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.600]  it was was an eastern european i think it was
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:27.040]  yeah it was like it was like russia i think i i mean ecc
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.240]  yeah of all the you know countries you know that i don't know if you've heard
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.960]  they're in they're in the news uh yeah yeah yeah like the russian
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.400]  regulatory agency leak leak these things whether that means
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.120]  they're imminent or just somehow they were filed months in
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:47.200]  advance i mean presumably the 27 inch or 30 whatever it's going to be
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.280]  the bigger iMac with the m1 pro and m1 max
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:57.920]  inside i presumably it would come at WWDC at the latest yeah right i mean
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:01.280]  alongside a preview of the m1 pro mac pro or whatever right
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:04.640]  right i that's it whether they that's what they're
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.640]  you know that's the schedule that they're going to announce it at WWDC
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.480]  in june or they're going to do it uh next week or two weeks from now in early
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.000]  march or whether they're planning on one more
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.320]  event in between this march 1 in WWDC you know like a late
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.240]  april type of thing uh we don't it's hard for
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:31.280]  them given how much prep there is for WWDC every year
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:38.160]  yeah and it's it yeah exactly it just seems easier to do one event with more
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:43.200]  devices packed in than two and i know and i'm sure you
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.640]  remember but like because i you and i had a really funny conversation in 2017
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:50.320]  when they did the mother of all WWDCs and not only did they do every operating
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:53.760]  system but they did new mac pros new iMacs the
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:56.960]  home pod new ipad pros and you were just like i'm
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.040]  not i'm not taking any of this stuff back with me
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.280]  right there's way too much and i went there i talked to one of them and
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.400]  they're like yeah Gruber's not coming uh what else might they announce there's
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:13.040]  also the pro level mac mini which you know and the
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:17.600]  mac mini is has been split basically in in rough
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.320]  look you know description like the 13-inch macbook pros were
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:28.800]  where there's the pro pro one with more ports and better performance
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.400]  and then the sort of ads just sort of the basic one
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.480]  with two ports and you know this and that yeah well they
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.000]  got rid of that right like originally the
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.560]  the mac mini came out as the 500 you swap it in you rip out your pc you put
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:45.120]  this in and then they didn't update it for a long
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.200]  long long long time and then famously in 2018 they came out
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.240]  with like a real strut and saying now it's a pro level product
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.600]  it's more expensive but it's got all these pro features and they discontinued
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:58.880]  the low end model and then again in 2020 they came out
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.000]  with it made it silver again because it had gone to space gray and only made a
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.400]  low end model and they've left the intel model
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.080]  like with the like previously with the macbook pros and currently with the iMac
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.480]  they've left the intel one that's a high-end pro version
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:13.600]  right i mean you could still go in the apple store and buy a 27-inch iMac
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.000]  that's got an intel chip in it i that's my gut and again just sort of
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.600]  my you know um i can kind of smell the way
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.280]  you know i i sniff test the way apple thinks my guess
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:29.920]  is that the pro tier mac mini will be space gray
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:34.480]  right and with the apple silicon right so if you see in a mac mini you'll be
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:36.400]  even you'll even be able to know is it a
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.280]  consumer level apple silicon mac mini or a pro level one is it
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:45.440]  regular gray or space gray how much great the rumors are also that
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.920]  it's going to get a redesign and that the consumer version
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:51.760]  might be like the iMac where it's going to have this this new top on it and
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:54.880]  and size that are going to be colored like multi-colored as well right
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.640]  yeah that would be interesting uh what else
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:01.600]  display people think that pros don't like colors because like they don't make
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.920]  the pro stuff in color but if you're actually a pro and you're
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.840]  working on color correct material you can't have like red or green or blue
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.320]  blowing out the cones in your eyes while you're trying to do your
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:13.440]  your color sensitive work so that's why those are always gray yeah but your mac
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.080]  mini you could just you could just put a throw it in the
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.160]  closet yeah yeah throw it in the closet put a
[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.440]  put a handkerchief over it or something you know
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.640]  it's not not hard to hide i mean as opposed to
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.560]  the the iMacs right there's no getting away from the color on the eye
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:34.000]  on the the colorful iMacs um and then that leads us to standalone displays
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.320]  right like what do you hook up the yeah thing and you know uh i don't
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.120]  believe the rumors that they're working on multiple sizes
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.800]  of consumer grade you know there's rumors that you know 24 inch 27 inch
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.080]  a new xdr an updated version of the xdr that actually would have like
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.760]  apple silicon chip inside to do some sort of whatever
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.360]  you know processing properly mini led because that one was just before mini led
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.000]  it's still it has way more uh discrete display zones
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.680]  but it's it's not it's still regular led to me i think the best we can hope for i
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.800]  mean i i would love it i because i i i really
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.960]  think apple has been disappointed by the third
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:18.960]  party display market picking up the slack uh
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:23.040]  if apple doesn't do it it's apparently no one's going to do it and it does get
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.960]  into the different i know i've spoken with
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.080]  this spoken about this on the show probably with you at some point but
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.520]  it does get into like another fundamental difference in the pc market
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.760]  and the mac market where in the pc market
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:37.440]  retina is not as big a deal and a huge part
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.440]  of the pc market of of people who are willing to spend
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.360]  let's say you know a premium for a really good display
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.800]  are gamers who don't definitely don't want retina
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.160]  right they want frame rate and brightness and
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.520]  other things and retina would actually defeat the purpose
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:58.720]  of getting the highest possible frame rate that they can get
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.760]  um well it's also they'll take a 4k display if you give it to them but they
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.800]  have no need for color management where people who are working on a mac
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.880]  they want to take advantage of the end to end color management it'd be
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:09.440]  ridiculous not to and reference modes and all those things
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.560]  right and you know all the various features that apple has across all their
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.200]  displays and yeah true tone and and etc um and a decent
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:20.000]  looking enclosure that doesn't destroy your wi-fi
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.360]  or fritz out or something that's plagued all the lg versions of the exact same
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.760]  panel or wobble yeah like it's just like it's the
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.480]  exact same panel as the imac but they just put it in the worst
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:34.320]  possible enclosure i don't see how i know some people
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.960]  you know i don't i forget what's german and what's not but some people have
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.080]  speculated maybe it's just the pro mac mini that's coming in march
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.600]  and not the imac i don't that to me is a hard announcement
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:49.200]  because to me there's more people waiting for the imac and it
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:55.840]  and it's a more exciting thing to show right it's going to be good looking and
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:59.360]  exciting to look at in the way that last year's consumer
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.560]  grade 24-inch imacs were whereas no matter what they do with the
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:07.600]  mac mini form factor right it it it's it's a mini it's just a
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.120]  little it's a little square you know you you and the only like interesting thing
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.160]  they could do is if they wanted to announce dual die m1
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:17.280]  max but then you ruin that for an imac pro or a mac pro
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.280]  announcement later right like they specifically didn't announce a15 with
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:23.760]  the ipad mini because they wanted to do that with the iphone
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.560]  and like that's the exact same problem with announcing a mac mini without
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:32.400]  announcing my mac pro or a mac pro all right so i don't know you know i guess
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.840]  i i would guess what of the mac mini with pro you know m1 max m1 pro
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:46.560]  silicon and the bigger pro max imac if we don't hear about them in early march
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.760]  we'll get them at wwdc or before but it would be a little weird to have
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:55.040]  another event before but we'll see what do you think about like because a
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:57.280]  lot of people are concerned that if they don't like
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.480]  they they conflate the number with the capability so that an
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.560]  if an m2 comes out it suddenly makes m1 pro and m1 max
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:08.160]  seem obsolete and why would apple do this and the whole branding is bad
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:12.400]  and it reminds me of when the a12z ipad pro came out
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:17.360]  six months after the a13 in the iphone and people had the exact same issue with
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:20.000]  it and you know you can explain to them it's
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.200]  way more massively multi-core so even though each single core
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.280]  isn't as fast you have so many more cores but they just see a number
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.760]  on a package you think that's gonna affect m2 versus m1 pro or max
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.040]  well i think it's going to be interesting because i do i would expect
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.520]  then that when they do this that the m2s will
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:43.040]  have better single core performance right i mean and we're
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:46.320]  that's going to rub people the wrong way even though that's the way the intel
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.240]  world has worked it's just that it's no it's it's so
[01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:54.960]  that the nomenclature is so less clear right like so for example the xeon chips
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.080]  in the imac pro that the slate you know the
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:00.960]  space grey imac pro that was based on the intel
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:04.640]  stuff had you know i i think even when it debuted
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.520]  had worse single core performance than some
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.640]  certain other models it's the multi-core thing right so
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.840]  especially the high core count ones they went really low down right like so like
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.360]  the the basic story of how you know these
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:22.320]  pro multi uh you know with an emphasis on
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.000]  the parallel processing right like having 20
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.920]  cpu cores or 40 up to 40 which we might get in
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:36.720]  in the the highest end mac pro with apple silicon 40 cpu cores you
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.760]  know who even knows i mean how many fingers
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.800]  you need to count all the gpu cores they're going to have but that the way
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:47.280]  that this works is you come out with the consumer
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.160]  version with fewer cores with the latest and greatest process
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.760]  and you get the greatest highest single core performance
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:59.200]  and then it's like an 18 month window before it filters down
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.600]  to the multi-core people i think will just have to deal with it
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:06.720]  i do think that there will be a media freak out
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.000]  of holy crap they're selling they're selling this
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.040]  mac pro for you know what forty thousand dollars
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:19.440]  whatever is going to go up to right put a crazy price tag on a maxed
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.280]  out mac pro with apple silicon with 40 cores
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.200]  and uh you know 100 gpu cores and gobs and
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:31.600]  gobs and gobs of ram and this huge price tag of like a luxury
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:35.200]  car and they're like hey and it you know it loses on single core geek
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:40.080]  bench to uh you know a 1200 macbook air with an m2
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:43.120]  i deal with it that's the you know you know then
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:46.160]  then then luck if you're impressed by that
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.480]  then lucky you spend the 1200 comes to my house and hits my computer with a
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.280]  baseball bat right i do think though that that's
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.160]  clearly going to be the case i mean that's just the way it's
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.840]  clear the way it works it's just that you know and apple's
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.160]  nomenclature of calling it the m1 and then the m1 pro and m1 max
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:07.920]  and then we're going to have the m2 and the m2 max and m2 pro
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:12.080]  yeah you know by putting simple numbers on it it's it's easier to understand
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.880]  than all the various lakes and the core i nines and core i
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.280]  sevens and i mean we've had core i sevens and i nines and i fives for
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:25.200]  a decade right like the five and the seven and the nine don't correlate to
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.000]  whether they're newer or older they're they're
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.200]  tears and it's you know i'm sure it makes sense to somebody at intel
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.560]  and you know and there are enthusiasts who have it all memorized
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:40.640]  but you can't figure it out just from the names whereas with apple's names
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.680]  they're so much more clear it certainly seems as though the
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.520]  pro computers should have faster everything than the consumer ones but
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.320]  that's just not the way the silicon world works today
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.880]  and if actually they're smart they mitigate it because like when you look
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.640]  at the m1 pro and m1 max they're broken up into two zones so
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.760]  that you have half the CPUs in each of the zones and then
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:05.120]  one side could be flat out with single core while the other side
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:08.160]  is the frequency is stepped down for multi-core so you don't lose as much as
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.400]  you would in like just a generalized CPU
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:14.320]  environment but the the m1 is based on the a14 from the
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.960]  iphone 12 and if it comes out anytime before the
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.680]  end of the year m2 will be based on the a15
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:22.560]  and so you get a little bit better performance but way more efficient
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:25.680]  performance cores way more performant efficiency cores
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.680]  way way better graphics cores pro right like you get all of these things bundled
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.640]  into it that core for core is going to be better but
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.840]  you're still not going to compete with 32 gpu cores on an m1 max yeah
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.400]  it's you know i i think we see the way the pattern's going but it's definitely
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:47.040]  like i think for the foreseeable future going to be this 18 month
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  at least cycle between the latest you know
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.280]  and and i guess even more maybe it's more like a
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:02.320]  a a 30 month cycle if you count the a series chip from an iphone a year
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:08.560]  later becoming the m plus one integer for the mac consumer
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.120]  and then 18 months after that before it filters to the mac pro where it has
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.760]  20 to 40 cores and etc etc you know it's which was the pattern right like they
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:23.920]  had the a5x a6x no x no a7x a8x a9x a10x no a11x
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:28.320]  then a 12x 12z no 13x but then m1 is essentially 14x
[01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:31.760]  so they were on like a 15 an 18 month cycle with the
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.800]  the extended versions of the chips anyway right right
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.520]  so i don't know what do you think are they going to do a standalone display at
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:41.120]  a consumer price i hope so i mean there have been rumors
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.760]  of it for a while and i know everybody is like talking about
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.360]  custom apple silicon but apple has been making their own tcon controllers for
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.720]  those displays like for the imac going back till 2014
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.040]  or something so to me apple silicon just sounds like
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.760]  they're going to have the display engine and something that'll minimize the
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.800]  impact of the graphics on the card so that all makes a lot of sense to me
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.880]  if they could bring that in for a thousand dollars
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.840]  it would certainly you i love this joke you made back at the event where you're
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.960]  like 6k for 6k is that the price or the resolution
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:10.080]  you know and that's true though like it's out of the reach of almost every
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.040]  consumer and that makes sense if you want to
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.720]  bring a new technology to market but if you don't bring that technology down it
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.920]  doesn't help anybody well and it's technically overkill right it's it you
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:24.960]  know it's the same thing as like buying a 40 core mac pro right like i i
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.680]  literally have no need there's nothing i do that's even
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:31.040]  vaguely that parallel i know some people do right there's all
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:36.240]  sorts of people who do need it but the pro display xdr costs so much
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.680]  because it does things that you really have to be like a
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:43.520]  color pro or video editing pro to it's supposed
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.040]  to save you money on a 40k display not cost you money on a 1k display
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:51.360]  yeah it's the the issue of how much would an apple standalone display cost
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.520]  is is tough i would love it if it was 999
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:02.080]  and if you know if the iMac is like two thousand dollars to start
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:06.880]  it's you know it could you get the display from the iMac for half the price
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.560]  maybe you know if if it were 1500 for the
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:15.040]  display does it make sense that the display is three quarters of the cost of
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:17.920]  the iMac you know you start running well that was
[01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:20.560]  the old joke is that you got the free you got the free computer when you bought
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:25.520]  the iMac display but you never ever lose you never ever lose by betting the over
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.800]  on how much blank from apple going to cost
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.640]  and for everything like air tags where it's like hey 29 bucks that's not bad
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.760]  you know that's a reasonable price there's all sorts of products you know
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:40.800]  like the pro display xdr and a thousand dollars stairs yeah the wheels how many
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:45.760]  wheels do you want uh but it's oh boy ed and i you know i
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:49.280]  know that we you even mentioned that apple has a rejuvenated they even
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.280]  announced it explicitly a rejuvenated interest in the mac mini
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.520]  as a product and and want to support the people who depend on it for various
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:00.880]  reasons begging for a display because it needs
[01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:06.240]  a display but even if you want to be a little cynical about how much apple
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:09.040]  cares about the mac mini customers who need a display
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:14.080]  and that they think that people who are going to spend five six seven eight
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:17.920]  ten thousand dollars on a mac pro they can just cough up the dough for the pro
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:22.800]  display xdr yeah um to me the market
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.880]  for the big market for a standalone nice apple display are
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.080]  the tens hundreds million users of macbooks who would like to have a
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.600]  standalone display on their desk to connect their macbook to
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:38.640]  so and so desperate that a lot of us have said we'll just take an imac just
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:41.280]  bring back target display right because we lost that when they started
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:43.760]  making their own t-cons because they couldn't sync to
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.040]  two 4k streams to make the 5k display they haven't brought it back
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.920]  so you can't even you can't even give 1500 bucks for a good imac and make that
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.080]  your display so hopefully they do it it would make for a better
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:58.960]  uh to me it as i would imagine it makes for a better unveiling
[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.320]  to be able to show the the uh new you know updated mac minis
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:07.600]  connected to an apple display that doesn't start at six thousand dollars
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.520]  because like why are you buying a mac mini if you
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:15.280]  have a six thousand dollar display um and you know it would be cohesive to
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:20.000]  announce it alongside the new imac and say it's the same great display you
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.800]  know whichever one they announced first i don't know maybe they announced the
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.080]  standalone display first and then the imac or the imac and that
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.720]  but either way whichever one comes second they could say it's the same
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.480]  great display with all the great mini led features
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.040]  and the every blah blah blah you know then
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:38.640]  they could skip that whole part you know just say same great it's one
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:41.440]  case where like because they did announce airplay but like that that's
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:44.240]  one case where wireless isn't as good right like it just doesn't work as well
[01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:48.560]  as a cable at that point right uh i know we've gone a little over the
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.720]  hour i was hoping for but uh a little bit a little bit but we saw
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:56.320]  after the rumor is that there's going to be a new ipad air
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:00.560]  do we care yeah well so a lot of people kind of snickering at the
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:03.440]  announcement there's going to be the iphone se and the and the air but those
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:06.800]  are huge like not nerd like i think we forget sometimes
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.840]  that tech twitter and tech youtube are a very small percent of apple's market
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.480]  like maybe 10 and there are a lot of people who just
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.960]  they would i don't know if they care that much about an event but they really
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.120]  want updated or they want new iphone se's and new ipad airs and so i think
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:22.160]  they're good products i don't know if they'll make particularly exciting event
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:24.400]  but if they're there along with a couple other things
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:27.280]  like i could see them getting in the old days it would be a couple slides like
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.840]  you know so we'll put up a couple and we're also updating this
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.160]  and we're also updating that because the mac but the ipad air got its new
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:37.440]  redesign in 2020 but it didn't get 5g the way that the
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  mic the mac mini the ipad mini update got last year so
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.760]  just putting in the new chip and putting in the new
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:47.280]  the new 5g radio brings it back up to par it's just not
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:51.040]  it's not super thrilling yeah it sort of sets 5g as the baseline
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.360]  right like everything yeah everything that has a cellular modem from apple
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:56:59.440]  supports 5g or it's by some definition i don't i don't think the watch
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.520]  does yet i don't know i doubt it yeah i actually don't even know what the
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.880]  cellular watch does no it's it's barely got what's got like uh
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:10.800]  piggybacked lte right but nobody i mean nobody's using their you can't even use
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.560]  your watch as your only cell phone you know it's it's only a peripheral to your
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:17.120]  phone so i i'm gonna say that doesn't count
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.400]  so yeah you know uh you know it it sticks out a little bit that the
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:26.240]  brand new or brand new from the end of last year ipad mini
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.800]  is in some ways technically superior to the ipad air so at least bring the ipad
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.520]  air up to that ipad mini level and make it bigger
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.800]  it just does not seem like a you know it i'm sure they'll send
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:40.080]  cell gobs of them i'm sure it'll be a great product it's good to get
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:44.400]  everything on 5g cannot see this as uh if it were the
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.200]  only thing they had ready to go i don't think they'd have an event i think
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:49.280]  that's the sort of thing where they would
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.320]  uh again covid times are weird you know but
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.720]  pre-covid times they would just invite the media to new york or cooper and or
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:59.440]  cupertino yeah for briefings last time with the new
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.400]  air right it really makes sense and how they do that sort of release
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.040]  in the covid era uh even if if we're just at the tail end of it you know but
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.560]  some kind of do it by press release maybe have some briefings
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.000]  a day in advance with uh you know an nda you know
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.360]  this will be announced you know tomorrow or something like that
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.040]  i just can't see how the ipad air makes for an event i really don't because i
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:24.720]  because it's super interesting because like
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:27.040]  last year april was an actual product event but
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:31.040]  the two previous ones uh 2018 20 2018 2019
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:35.680]  2018 was an education event in chicago 2019 was in cupertino but it was a
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.240]  services event and they did announce products like new
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:42.880]  air pad new uh air pods and new macbook airs new mac max or new ipad
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.920]  airs new ipad minis but those were all dropped in press releases in new york
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.000]  trips right to your point those weren't part of
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.520]  the event well and and then you know to to cycle back to the same idea it's
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:59.280]  is is a brand new iphone se demo-able right if it looks the same as the iphone
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:02.880]  se we know and it just it looks the same has the same starting
[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:06.640]  price but has the a15 chip we already heard
[01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:09.840]  about six months ago and 5g which has been out for
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:14.320]  you know almost two years how do you demo that right like there has to you
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.480]  know the the whole point of these shows whether they're actual on-stage
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:22.000]  events you know with in-person media broadcast
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.880]  out there or these tv style shows that they've been doing
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:28.480]  since 2020 they have to show something there has to
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:33.920]  be a story to tell and something to demo and to me the iphone se just a faster
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:38.400]  chip that's only as fast as the iphones that came out six months ago in 5g
[01:59:38.400 --> 01:59:41.760]  how do you demo that so that to me so they've done it like
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:45.760]  they jaws did a really good se demo back in 2016 with the first one but
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.120]  the second one never got a demo because that event was cancelled for coven so we
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.640]  just got we just got a press release for the iphone se 2 but
[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:58.240]  the only parallel i can think of is that entry level uh now it's 10.2 inch
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:01.760]  ipad where every year every september they've been updating that
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:04.400]  and i try to think of that slide at the end that has all the boxes on it that
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:07.280]  shows all the new features and how could you possibly fill that
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.520]  out and that's the only thing that comes close because
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:12.720]  they spend two seconds talking about the new processor and radio and then they
[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:16.320]  recapitulate new features in ios and then they put the slide up at the end
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:19.920]  but it's like a three minute long segment right and you know and they can
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.600]  do things for demos that just show people using it you know like with the
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:26.320]  mini with the ipad mini they love showing it
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.760]  with pilots you know who can put it in their big cargo pants side pocket
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:33.520]  you know and people use it in this place in that place but there's only so much
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.440]  of that you can do i mean it's it there's like a minimum
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:42.640]  length to an event which i would peg at about 45 minutes
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:45.600]  i mean yeah like if it's you know only half an hour
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.600]  why why have the event so long story short that just it just fills
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.400]  me with optimism that there's something exciting mac related
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.960]  yes to anchor this march 8th event which to me would have to be the
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:04.960]  the bigger imac um because i just don't see the iphone se
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.520]  with 5g or an ipad air with 5g as being
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:13.360]  uh you know how do you fill a half hour than a couple slides
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.640]  right it's it put them in the first 20 minutes and then
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:22.720]  you know yeah have some mac related boom you know to to go with it boy that
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.720]  that that's much more exciting yeah that's what i'm hoping for
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.000]  all right thank you renee uh i would also like to thank you sir
