[00:00.000 --> 00:05.880]  Let me start by asking you this, did you watch any of the Little League World Series?
[00:05.880 --> 00:11.480]  I didn't, though I know that was interesting to me because I know it was Ohio versus Michigan.
[00:11.480 --> 00:15.520]  And as you may recall, that's something that's near and dear to my heart as I grew up in
[00:15.520 --> 00:20.920]  Ohio and then I went to University of Michigan and I defected, which is a big point of consternation
[00:20.920 --> 00:26.280]  amongst many in my immediate sort of childhood vicinity who are all big Ohio State fans.
[00:26.280 --> 00:31.040]  So there's this rivalry that exists between Ohio and Michigan, dating pretty much to that
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.800]  football, college football rivalry.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.200]  But I didn't watch the Little League World Series, but I do know Michigan won.
[00:36.200 --> 00:37.440]  I did not watch a lot of it.
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.360]  I mean, you know, I mean, it's a Little League World Series, but I do enjoy watching it.
[00:42.360 --> 00:45.840]  And I'd had it on during the afternoon, like watching lunch a couple times last week.
[00:45.840 --> 00:50.440]  And it's a fun thing to just pop on and just watch for a little bit.
[00:50.440 --> 00:52.760]  But the Michigan-Ohio angle was interesting.
[00:52.760 --> 00:57.600]  And as always, I believe I'm not a big college football fan, but Michigan won, beat Ohio
[00:57.600 --> 00:58.840]  for the Little League World Series.
[00:58.840 --> 01:01.360]  And I believe Michigan always beats Ohio.
[01:01.360 --> 01:03.560]  Is that the way it's been going lately?
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.920]  Yeah, that's a little bit of salt in the wound there, John.
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.320]  But I mean, it was that way when I was in college 400 years ago.
[01:13.320 --> 01:17.160]  It hasn't been that way in the past 20 years or whatever.
[01:17.160 --> 01:20.200]  But yeah, we'll see if they right the ship.
[01:20.200 --> 01:26.200]  I mean, it's always optimistic, but who knows?
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.200]  It's a weird year.
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.440]  I mean, last year, they had an awful year.
[01:29.440 --> 01:34.720]  You know, COVID was sort of the excuse for everyone, but they were two and four, only
[01:34.720 --> 01:35.960]  played six games.
[01:35.960 --> 01:38.160]  So anything will be better than that this year.
[01:38.160 --> 01:41.620]  So there's very low expectations.
[01:41.620 --> 01:46.760]  You can feel free to make as many Dallas Cowboys jokes as you would like.
[01:46.760 --> 01:48.040]  They're opening the season, right?
[01:48.040 --> 01:50.840]  I actually just looked because I was looking at who was playing.
[01:50.840 --> 01:53.120]  And it's a tough one, too, right?
[01:53.120 --> 01:54.520]  Are they playing the Bucks?
[01:54.520 --> 01:55.520]  Tampa Bay.
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.280]  Yeah, and their big underdog, seven and a half points less I looked, which seems fair.
[02:02.280 --> 02:07.640]  To be honest, I mean, you know me, I'll take the points.
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.760]  Yeah, I don't know how to feel about Dallas.
[02:12.760 --> 02:15.960]  I mean, they're going to win their division at least, right, this year?
[02:15.960 --> 02:16.960]  Well, they should.
[02:16.960 --> 02:18.160]  The East sucks again.
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.680]  Yeah, they're small favorites.
[02:19.680 --> 02:23.980]  But I mean, you know, I think Washington won it last year, or whoever won it was seven
[02:23.980 --> 02:24.980]  and nine.
[02:24.980 --> 02:29.200]  I mean, geez, it's the most embarrassing division, in my opinion, in all pro sports,
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.360]  but we shall see.
[02:32.360 --> 02:34.680]  Pro football is weird, especially lately.
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.960]  It's like the NFL's decades-long goal to sort of steer the rules towards, what do they call
[02:40.960 --> 02:43.400]  it, to get teams equal.
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.560]  Parity.
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.240]  Parity has been successful, you know, and at least they state it, right?
[02:50.240 --> 02:54.800]  It's like one of the things about that parity goal is at least it's not like, oh, they don't
[02:54.800 --> 02:56.680]  say that that's the goal.
[02:56.680 --> 02:59.800]  They've been very explicit that their goal is to achieve parity.
[02:59.800 --> 03:03.320]  They want all teams to be competitive.
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.320]  In a sport that doesn't naturally lean that way, right?
[03:07.320 --> 03:09.760]  Like baseball does lean towards parity.
[03:09.760 --> 03:18.320]  Like the best teams in pro baseball win like 70% of the games and the worst still win 30%.
[03:18.320 --> 03:25.720]  Whereas in football, it's really easy to be bad like the Jets and, you know, threaten
[03:25.720 --> 03:32.880]  to go 0 and 16 and harder to go 16 and 0, but you get 14 and 2 and 13 and 3 teams all
[03:32.880 --> 03:33.880]  the time.
[03:33.880 --> 03:37.840]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that that's one of the strengths of football.
[03:37.840 --> 03:41.520]  Obviously television is like the biggest strength that football has going for it, to the point
[03:41.520 --> 03:46.580]  that it negates the biggest pain point and literal one and weakness of like how dangerous
[03:46.580 --> 03:47.580]  it is.
[03:47.580 --> 03:50.200]  And it's sort of surprising, right, that it's still as popular as it is given how
[03:50.200 --> 03:54.960]  many very real and very serious injuries we now know that result from the game.
[03:54.960 --> 03:57.140]  But they do benefit, of course, from television.
[03:57.140 --> 03:58.960]  It's like the perfect televised sport.
[03:58.960 --> 04:02.960]  And then the fact what you're talking about, like the parity, you know, some people would
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.160]  say, oh, well, it's great, you know, that to have dynasties.
[04:06.160 --> 04:08.920]  And certainly that's true, like when the Patriots are winning, you know, they're
[04:08.920 --> 04:09.920]  a good villain.
[04:09.920 --> 04:14.440]  And when the Cowboys 40 years ago or whenever were winning, they were a great villain.
[04:14.440 --> 04:18.480]  But the fact that anyone who roosts for any of these teams now thinks that they have a
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.040]  legitimate shot almost any year, I mean, in some cases, it's not but like, like, take
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.840]  for example, I'm a Cleveland Browns fan.
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.120]  I was about to use, I was about to cite them, right?
[04:28.120 --> 04:29.480]  Yeah, that's a great example.
[04:29.480 --> 04:33.800]  Like I was listening to one of Bill Simmons pods the other day, and it's, you know,
[04:33.800 --> 04:36.960]  they legitimately think that the Browns and the Bills are going to be two of the best
[04:36.960 --> 04:37.960]  teams in the AFC.
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.160]  And I think that's warranted for sure.
[04:40.160 --> 04:41.560]  And you know, we'll see how it plays out.
[04:41.560 --> 04:42.560]  But they were good last year.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.680]  And, you know, they should be better this year with Odell Beckham coming back and everything.
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.320]  And that's wild, like, right?
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.560]  Cleveland has been historically the laughing stock even, you know, ahead of the Jets in
[04:53.560 --> 04:55.640]  many regards, right?
[04:55.640 --> 04:59.040]  And they've been one of the old school teams, they were great in the, you know, bygone era
[04:59.040 --> 05:00.880]  of Jim Brown, and they won championships.
[05:00.880 --> 05:04.360]  They've never been to a Super Bowl, never even been to it.
[05:04.360 --> 05:08.480]  And you know, the fact that they've been able to put together a good team now, after years
[05:08.480 --> 05:14.480]  and years of being awful, since coming back in 99, gives you hope.
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.280]  Totally.
[05:16.280 --> 05:21.640]  The hard part about being an NFL, the optimistic part is before the preseason, there's always
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.960]  trades, players have short careers.
[05:25.960 --> 05:31.120]  Hope springs eternal, and a team like the Browns can seemingly come out of nowhere.
[05:31.120 --> 05:32.320]  And you think, like, are they lucky?
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.320]  Are they not?
[05:33.320 --> 05:36.000]  A month into the season, you're like, no, this team is good.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.920]  This is for real.
[05:37.920 --> 05:43.660]  The problem is you can get a month into the season and realize, oh, this is gonna be a
[05:43.660 --> 05:44.660]  long one.
[05:44.660 --> 05:46.660]  Yeah, yeah, totally.
[05:46.660 --> 05:50.960]  It's still warm outside on the East Coast, it hasn't even gotten cold yet, and my team
[05:50.960 --> 05:52.720]  is not gonna win.
[05:52.720 --> 05:55.920]  But yeah, yeah, yeah, but there's still, you know,
[05:55.920 --> 05:58.880]  the games are still entertaining, because there's only 16 of them.
[05:58.880 --> 06:02.360]  It's like, so you still want to watch, you want to see if there's any promise, you know,
[06:02.360 --> 06:06.880]  who you keep on the team for later in the year, who you keep on the team for next year.
[06:06.880 --> 06:10.280]  There's still reasons to watch, even if the teams are not great.
[06:10.280 --> 06:11.280]  Yeah.
[06:11.280 --> 06:15.900]  On the little league baseball front, the thing that occurred to me watching, I watched the
[06:15.900 --> 06:18.800]  end of the final game.
[06:18.800 --> 06:23.640]  And it's funny, because I don't even know the exact rules, like what the age limit is.
[06:23.640 --> 06:26.720]  I think it's 11, maybe it's 12.
[06:26.720 --> 06:31.000]  At the very oldest, it's like 12-year-old kids.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.160]  And the catcher on the Michigan team has a mustache.
[06:35.160 --> 06:42.160]  I mean, it's not like a Tom Selleck, but he's a big kid, and he has a mustache.
[06:42.160 --> 06:45.480]  And they were talking about it, ESPN, you know, the announcers were talking about it,
[06:45.480 --> 06:49.240]  that, you know, maybe he keeps it just to be a little intimidating, because he clearly
[06:49.240 --> 06:51.160]  looks bigger than the other kids.
[06:51.160 --> 06:53.760]  That's just what it's like to be 11 years old.
[06:53.760 --> 06:59.040]  I remember playing sports around that age, and I was a very late bloomer.
[06:59.040 --> 07:03.760]  I ended up being 6'2", somewhat tall.
[07:03.760 --> 07:08.080]  But when I was in ninth grade, I was the shortest kid on the basketball team, and I was about
[07:08.080 --> 07:13.480]  as thick as a strand of spaghetti.
[07:13.480 --> 07:17.360]  I'd go up for a rebounder, get in the paint, and I would just go bouncing back to half
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  court.
[07:18.360 --> 07:24.040]  I remember what it was like being 10 or 11, and thinking, like, all these kids are a head
[07:24.040 --> 07:25.040]  taller than me.
[07:25.040 --> 07:26.520]  This is not fair.
[07:26.520 --> 07:34.200]  But the pitcher who was on the mound for Michigan had to win the game, looked like he was like
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.200]  9.
[07:35.200 --> 07:38.440]  I mean, it's kind of fun.
[07:38.440 --> 07:41.800]  And I like the thing about baseball that's really interesting.
[07:41.800 --> 07:45.920]  Real little league, when you're just watching your kids play, can get rough, because the
[07:45.920 --> 07:50.800]  game can get really out of control, because it's a hard game to play, and kids are scared.
[07:50.800 --> 07:58.000]  But when you see the teams that are really good, but play in a very simplified fashion,
[07:58.000 --> 08:05.840]  it's a very fun game to watch, where nobody's really throwing that hard, and nobody can
[08:05.840 --> 08:07.680]  hit the ball that hard.
[08:07.680 --> 08:14.920]  Whereas Major League Baseball is dominated by pitchers who throw near or even over 100
[08:14.920 --> 08:21.040]  miles an hour, which is terrifying, and guys who can hit the ball 100 to 110 miles an hour
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.840]  off the bat.
[08:22.840 --> 08:25.240]  Whereas you watch this, it's just small ball, right?
[08:25.240 --> 08:26.240]  Lots of ground balls.
[08:26.240 --> 08:27.240]  Yeah, it's much more pure.
[08:27.240 --> 08:28.240]  I totally agree.
[08:28.240 --> 08:33.880]  In a way, it's also why I like watching, you know, obviously people go one way or the other.
[08:33.880 --> 08:37.760]  I like watching college football more than I like watching the NFL, sort of for similar
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.560]  reasons.
[08:39.560 --> 08:43.520]  Because you have players who you know, even on the best teams, maybe not Alabama, but
[08:43.520 --> 08:47.200]  sort of everyone else, there's going to be players who don't make the NFL.
[08:47.200 --> 08:53.520]  And you know, they're good, but they're not obscenely good, and, you know, the best necessarily
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.360]  at their position in the entire world.
[08:55.360 --> 08:57.320]  And that's often the case with the NFL.
[08:57.320 --> 09:01.680]  And you know, it's sort of like, I was talking the other day with a friend about, like the
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.440]  quarterbacks at Ohio State who have struggled in the NFL, right?
[09:06.440 --> 09:10.240]  Like Dwayne Haskins is the most recent example, he was on the Redskins, right?
[09:10.240 --> 09:13.600]  I'm sorry, the Washington team, I really shouldn't say that.
[09:13.600 --> 09:20.080]  And now he's on the Steelers, I think he's maybe the backup or something like that.
[09:20.080 --> 09:25.000]  But Ohio State always has these quarterbacks who are amazing in college and then just do
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.120]  not translate into the pros for whatever reason.
[09:28.120 --> 09:33.680]  And again, it's sort of like, it's a weird dichotomy to watch them in college, and they're
[09:33.680 --> 09:34.680]  so good.
[09:34.680 --> 09:36.400]  And you know, of course, beating Michigan and whatnot.
[09:36.400 --> 09:41.760]  But like, then they go to the pros, and they're just sort of another, maybe not average, certainly
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.040]  above average, but still, they get, you know, killed by these defenses.
[09:46.040 --> 09:48.520]  Because these defenses feature the best players in the world.
[09:48.520 --> 09:52.080]  Yeah, just absolutely just amazing athletes.
[09:52.080 --> 09:55.600]  Anyway, let me take a break here up front and thank our first sponsor.
[09:55.600 --> 10:02.320]  My very dear friends at Linode, you can visit linode.com slash the talk show and see why

[10:24.880 --> 10:29.040]  you get support any day, anytime.
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.360]  Ease of use of setup, it's clear why developers have been trusting Linode for projects both
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.240]  big and small, since 2003.
[10:38.240 --> 10:43.000]  You can deploy your entire application stack with Linodes one click app marketplace or
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.740]  build it all from scratch and manage everything yourself with supported centralized tools
[10:47.740 --> 10:49.640]  like terraform.
[10:49.640 --> 10:55.200]  They offer the best price to performance value for all compute instances, including GPUs,
[10:55.200 --> 11:00.640]  as well as block storage, Kubernetes, and their upcoming bare metal release.

[11:04.360 --> 11:05.960]  projects, not your infrastructure.
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.680]  I host Staring Fireball there.
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.680]  I love it.
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.960]  I am almost embarrassed at how little I pay to host Staring Fireball there.
[11:13.960 --> 11:16.680]  It is just an incredible bargain.
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.400]  And every time I log in and look at the CPU, it is like it could be the middle of the afternoon
[11:21.400 --> 11:26.720]  on a weekday, peak traffic, and the CPU, it's like, is this even the right server?
[11:26.720 --> 11:27.720]  It's like 2%.
[11:27.720 --> 11:29.880]  It is amazing.
[11:29.880 --> 11:33.880]  And it just runs and runs and runs and runs and runs.
[11:33.880 --> 11:37.020]  I couldn't be happier with hosting there.
[11:37.020 --> 11:43.280]  You can find out more at Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E, linode.com slash the talk show.

[11:58.760 --> 12:01.080]  My thanks to Linode.
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.280]  So you mentioned the Washington football team.
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.520]  I guess they're going to stick with that as their name at this point?
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.440]  So I actually looked this up recently because, as you probably are well aware also, my hometown
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.360]  baseball team, the Cleveland Indians still right now, but they will be changing their
[12:19.360 --> 12:22.000]  name to the Guardians, right?
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Starting next season.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.240]  And so I was actually looking up what the status was on Washington, because it's sort
[12:26.240 --> 12:27.520]  of sad, right?
[12:27.520 --> 12:34.000]  They've been playing under the no-name guise of the Washington football team for a couple
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  of years now.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.920]  The word is, at least of a few weeks ago, was that they are going to change it some
[12:39.920 --> 12:42.320]  point next year still.
[12:42.320 --> 12:43.960]  So I do think that they are going to have a team.
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.480]  I mean, I think the way that they've done it, while it was obviously very clumsy and
[12:49.480 --> 12:53.080]  way overdue, it sort of sticks now.
[12:53.080 --> 13:00.040]  They maintain the colors, and everyone knows to say that, even though I dropped the old
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.040]  name earlier.
[13:01.040 --> 13:02.040]  I do too.
[13:02.040 --> 13:03.040]  I do too.
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.040]  Yeah.
[13:04.040 --> 13:05.040]  It's hard not to.
[13:05.040 --> 13:06.040]  What do you think they should do, though?
[13:06.040 --> 13:10.840]  Should they change it to an official thing beyond the Washington football team?
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.920]  I think they should.
[13:11.920 --> 13:20.960]  And I know that soccer, AKA English football clubs, I know that all over Europe, that something
[13:20.960 --> 13:27.680]  like team name football club is, you know, town name football club.
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.480]  I think that's, you know, like even like here in the U.S., it's NYFC, New York Football
[13:32.480 --> 13:35.680]  Club, is common.
[13:35.680 --> 13:43.280]  I think the problem with trying to make that stick in the NFL is it's too common to say,
[13:43.280 --> 13:45.640]  it's just not how people talk about the teams.
[13:45.640 --> 13:49.600]  Like, you know, like you were saying, like, who did the Cowboys play on the opening night,
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.360]  which is Thursday night game coming up soon?
[13:52.360 --> 13:53.720]  The Bucks, right?
[13:53.720 --> 13:58.120]  You just want to say, oh, man, I think something simple, something quick.
[13:58.120 --> 14:02.760]  We just want to have a nickname and always using.
[14:02.760 --> 14:09.440]  And sometimes you say, you know, like, you know, here in Philly, they'll chant, guaranteed,
[14:09.440 --> 14:15.140]  when the Cowboys come to town, Dallas sucks, Dallas sucks, or worse, right?
[14:15.140 --> 14:16.280]  But they'll call them Dallas.
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.280]  So you do use the town name, but it's tough.
[14:21.280 --> 14:22.280]  And you're right.
[14:22.280 --> 14:24.640]  It's de-emphasized for sure.
[14:24.640 --> 14:33.840]  And the other element of that is Washington's former name, so I grew up, like I said, in
[14:33.840 --> 14:40.480]  Ohio, and a lot of my high school friends went to the Miami University in Ohio, which
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.160]  is not the University of Miami in Florida, it's the Ohio version, right?
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.280]  And Ben Roethlisberger famously went to school and played quarterback.
[14:47.280 --> 14:50.760]  So they had the same name as what Washington formerly had.
[14:50.760 --> 14:56.000]  And they changed their name, I think, in the early 90s to the Red Hawks.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.440]  It's an awful name, right?
[14:57.440 --> 15:01.720]  It's just like, it's sort of like trying to maintain continuity with the former name,
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.120]  but it sort of doesn't make sense.
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.600]  It's sort of, you know, cutesy, I don't do not like it.
[15:07.600 --> 15:09.680]  Whereas I do like what the Indians did.
[15:09.680 --> 15:10.680]  And I think you did too.
[15:10.680 --> 15:14.400]  I think I linked to it, you know, when that happened, because it's like, and honestly,
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.200]  I didn't think I would like it.
[15:16.200 --> 15:17.200]  It didn't.
[15:17.200 --> 15:19.560]  And when I first heard it, I thought it was sort of like, that seems weird.
[15:19.560 --> 15:21.520]  It seems a little bit too close to Guardians of the Galaxy.
[15:21.520 --> 15:25.020]  It's just like a Mighty Ducks situation with Disney type thing.
[15:25.020 --> 15:30.400]  But now it really did grow on me quickly because it has great continuity just in the way that
[15:30.400 --> 15:31.480]  it looks, right?
[15:31.480 --> 15:34.560]  Like the IANS ending.
[15:34.560 --> 15:41.200]  And you know, they have some real issues with apparently, I think, an indoor roller derby
[15:41.200 --> 15:46.360]  team, which apparently filed a trademark ahead of them, which is sort of a humorous situation.
[15:46.360 --> 15:47.560]  And hopefully they can resolve that.
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.720]  But I do think that they did a good job, yeah, picking something that maintains a great continuity
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.680]  and the look is sort of, you know, similar, the colors are going to be the same, obviously.
[15:55.680 --> 15:56.760]  And so they did a good job with that.
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.180]  I don't know what Washington can do beyond, like I said, the Red Hawks like that.
[16:01.180 --> 16:02.180]  Hopefully they don't do that.
[16:02.180 --> 16:04.280]  But would they do something like that, you know?
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.720]  I think I've mentioned this years ago, I don't, I seem to recall talking about it somewhere
[16:07.720 --> 16:08.720]  on a podcast.
[16:08.720 --> 16:14.280]  But one of the ones that I like is the Red Tails, which was the name of the Tuskegee
[16:14.280 --> 16:22.640]  Airman, which was a bunch of black pilots, I think, in World War Two, right?
[16:22.640 --> 16:24.000]  Yeah, Tuskegee.
[16:24.000 --> 16:34.320]  And you know, Washington, DC has the highest percentage of black citizens of any city in
[16:34.320 --> 16:36.080]  North America.
[16:36.080 --> 16:39.240]  It's it, to me, that works.
[16:39.240 --> 16:43.240]  I don't know, they got to do something, but there's got to be a way I don't know, going
[16:43.240 --> 16:47.100]  two years like this with a no name.
[16:47.100 --> 16:53.640]  It just seems so ham-fisted communications-wise, whereas what the Indians did to me as a comms
[16:53.640 --> 16:59.760]  issue, which is going to be a big part of what we talk about going forward on the show.
[16:59.760 --> 17:00.760]  They handled it.
[17:00.760 --> 17:04.280]  So, A, I think Guardians is a great choice.
[17:04.280 --> 17:09.080]  And I didn't even realize this, I'm not as familiar with Greater Cleveland, but there
[17:09.080 --> 17:13.920]  already are these guardian statues on a bridge.
[17:13.920 --> 17:15.800]  Famous statues on the bridge.
[17:15.800 --> 17:19.880]  I honestly did not know their official name, which is another reason why when I first heard
[17:19.880 --> 17:21.680]  it, I didn't fully understand it.
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.120]  But yes, they're the guardians of, is it of traffic?
[17:26.120 --> 17:27.120]  Something like that.
[17:27.120 --> 17:28.120]  Something along those lines.
[17:28.120 --> 17:29.120]  Yeah.
[17:29.120 --> 17:31.240]  But they are really cool statues.
[17:31.240 --> 17:36.640]  They look sort of, I equated them to those statues in Lord of the Rings, like where they're
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.500]  the Argonaut type statues that sort of guard that one entryway.
[17:40.500 --> 17:41.500]  They sort of look like that.
[17:41.500 --> 17:42.500]  They're pretty cool.
[17:42.500 --> 17:43.500]  Yeah.
[17:43.500 --> 17:44.500]  Very cool.
[17:44.500 --> 17:45.500]  So it's a great name.
[17:45.500 --> 17:46.500]  I love it.
[17:46.500 --> 17:49.960]  A couple of people after I posted that, you know, give my thumbs up to it, you know, posted
[17:49.960 --> 17:55.680]  a picture, a recent picture of some Cleveland Indians players standing before a game or
[17:55.680 --> 17:57.200]  accepting a trophy or something.
[17:57.200 --> 18:04.240]  And because only the IANS was visible on their jerseys, it already looked like they could
[18:04.240 --> 18:06.040]  have been wearing guardian.
[18:06.040 --> 18:07.160]  It just rolls off the tongue.
[18:07.160 --> 18:08.160]  It's a great choice.
[18:08.160 --> 18:09.240]  But they timed it well.
[18:09.240 --> 18:15.040]  They didn't wait until the Indians name was too hot, right?
[18:15.040 --> 18:22.440]  Like the Washington team waited until way past the time when everybody agreed that hey,
[18:22.440 --> 18:31.040]  maybe who knows if all of these names related to Native Americans like the Kansas City Chiefs
[18:31.040 --> 18:35.280]  and the Atlanta Braves, who knows if they all should go or not?
[18:35.280 --> 18:38.580]  It's you know, there's a lot of Native Americans who are fine with all the names.
[18:38.580 --> 18:43.120]  There were Native Americans who a lot of them who were like, No, no, we're fine with the
[18:43.120 --> 18:44.120]  Washington name.
[18:44.120 --> 18:49.480]  You know, it's it was people who, you know, it I don't want to get into the politics of
[18:49.480 --> 18:50.480]  it.
[18:50.480 --> 18:54.840]  But there, there was a majority there was a consensus that that name had to go.
[18:54.840 --> 18:58.100]  And yeah, and a big problem with the Indians.
[18:58.100 --> 19:03.840]  One was was actually the logo, right, which they retired a while ago, and you know, well
[19:03.840 --> 19:08.920]  overdue there because it was, it was a really bad caricature.
[19:08.920 --> 19:13.460]  That yeah, it maintained, you know, throughout, you know, I think, you know, started probably
[19:13.460 --> 19:16.340]  in the 70s, 70s, something like that.
[19:16.340 --> 19:18.160]  They had an earlier version of it.
[19:18.160 --> 19:19.160]  And then it got even more pronounced.
[19:19.160 --> 19:23.400]  And everyone, of course, remembers it, I think, from Major League, the great baseball movie
[19:23.400 --> 19:24.400]  about the Indians.
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.680]  And, yeah, so they phased it out, right?
[19:26.680 --> 19:27.760]  They got rid of that.
[19:27.760 --> 19:29.600]  And they moved to the sea.
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.880]  And that allowed them, you know, to sort of more gracefully, I think, make this transition
[19:33.880 --> 19:36.720]  because, you know, while the sea is going to be different, slightly different under
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.240]  the Guardians, it's still going to be the sea, you know, so it's like the sea became
[19:40.240 --> 19:41.560]  the focal point of the team.
[19:41.560 --> 19:42.560]  And that's what you see.
[19:42.560 --> 19:45.320]  I like I like my current Indians hat is the sea one.
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.540]  It's not, you know, a chief chief Wahoo one, obviously.
[19:48.540 --> 19:50.240]  And so I think they did a good job with that.
[19:50.240 --> 19:55.720]  Whereas yeah, Washington, maybe unsurprising, given the sort of Daniel Snyder tenure of
[19:55.720 --> 20:01.780]  the team has been just, you know, very, very slow to do anything.
[20:01.780 --> 20:02.780]  Just hamfisted.
[20:02.780 --> 20:03.780]  Anyway.
[20:03.780 --> 20:07.880]  Oh, the other thing, too, about the the chief Wahoo logo is it was a terrible logo for a
[20:07.880 --> 20:08.880]  serious sport.
[20:08.880 --> 20:09.880]  Right?
[20:09.880 --> 20:10.880]  It was comical, right?
[20:10.880 --> 20:12.680]  Well, yeah, it was cartoony.
[20:12.680 --> 20:19.740]  And baseball is like I said, it's, it's, it's top athletes, throwing hard little balls around
[20:19.740 --> 20:21.160]  at 100 miles an hour.
[20:21.160 --> 20:27.480]  And I don't think I don't know what they would have done for major league if it wasn't the
[20:27.480 --> 20:29.720]  logo, but I feel like it had to be Cleveland, right?
[20:29.720 --> 20:30.720]  Because it's a comedy.
[20:30.720 --> 20:32.160]  It's a comical logo.
[20:32.160 --> 20:36.620]  Like no other team in baseball had a logo that was funny.
[20:36.620 --> 20:39.720]  It was a very strange choice.
[20:39.720 --> 20:46.600]  Really branding wise, the racial racism aspects aside, right?
[20:46.600 --> 20:50.480]  cartoony like logos had long felt I mean, has there ever been one?
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.440]  Like that's, I'm sure there was in this, you know, 70s or 80s I'm sure there have been
[20:54.440 --> 20:59.240]  other ones but it's hard to remember but like imagine if the St. Louis Cardinals instead
[20:59.240 --> 21:04.500]  of hat they have a very serious looking Cardinal that that Cardinal looks like it could.
[21:04.500 --> 21:08.920]  But imagine if instead if it was like Woody Woodpecker with like a googly eye, you know,
[21:08.920 --> 21:12.900]  it's like right that actually and the Cardinals is the perfect one because do you remember
[21:12.900 --> 21:18.600]  when the in the NFL the the Arizona team when they changed?
[21:18.600 --> 21:22.360]  They had to change their Cardinal at one point to be a more menacing looking right now because
[21:22.360 --> 21:26.680]  it was too it was just a cute looking bird before and they and that obviously didn't
[21:26.680 --> 21:31.300]  fit with the the sort of the what they were trying to project as a real serious football
[21:31.300 --> 21:32.300]  team.
[21:32.300 --> 21:38.960]  Look like a bird that was just ready to get just a standard bird bird watching out here
[21:38.960 --> 21:40.840]  looking at those these pretty cards.
[21:40.840 --> 21:44.440]  I know it wasn't a cardinal it was a pigeon but like it's sort of like was getting ready
[21:44.440 --> 21:50.480]  to be steamrolled like that poor bird who got hit by a Randy Johnson fastball back in
[21:50.480 --> 21:51.480]  the day.
[21:51.480 --> 21:56.680]  Oh that's funny yeah god that video is still amazing to watch.
[21:56.680 --> 22:02.720]  I know this is a digression on a digression but it still amazes me that of all the thousands
[22:02.720 --> 22:06.440]  and tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of pitches thrown in Major League Baseball
[22:06.440 --> 22:12.120]  in the televised era no bird ever got hit by a pitch until once and then of all the
[22:12.120 --> 22:14.540]  pitchers to do it.
[22:14.540 --> 22:18.840]  Right the most menacing and oh and I have a perfect way to bring it back around and
[22:18.840 --> 22:23.960]  we're really going to make people earn listening to some some of this this story before we
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.580]  go into the apple bread and butter that I think they want to hear but so you mentioned
[22:27.580 --> 22:32.040]  when you were a little a little kid playing sports that you were sort of undersized I
[22:32.040 --> 22:37.080]  was the opposite I was I'm right now about 5'10 and I was 5'10 when I was like 12 years
[22:37.080 --> 22:41.760]  old and so that meant that I was one of the largest kids in my grade and as a result I
[22:41.760 --> 22:47.680]  was also a pitcher on our baseball team and I was huge and so I was like sort of compared
[22:47.680 --> 22:53.040]  you know I would say a little bit over favorably probably to Randy Johnson but I actually grew
[22:53.040 --> 22:57.940]  my hair out as a result of that so I had a long hair kid I was super tall and I was trying
[22:57.940 --> 23:01.440]  to be menacing and intimidating like Randy Johnson on the mound and you know to some
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.280]  degree I think it worked I think it was more my my probably launch angle because I was
[23:05.280 --> 23:09.480]  so much taller but but yeah that brings it around to Randy Johnson then exploding a bird
[23:09.480 --> 23:15.620]  I never got a chance to do that but that video is is is just insane that that that actually
[23:15.620 --> 23:19.400]  happened there was a kid in my league when it towards the end a little league on another
[23:19.400 --> 23:24.640]  team and he was sort of like a town bully his name was Alex I you know I don't want
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.200]  to name his last name I don't want to slide but I still don't like the guy but he was
[23:28.200 --> 23:34.040]  so big I mean just unbelievably big he was the one who like parents would be like come
[23:34.040 --> 23:41.360]  on he's got to be too old he was he was a pitcher and it was a known fact that he would
[23:41.360 --> 23:47.200]  try to hit the first the first batter of the game just to terrify the team which is smart
[23:47.200 --> 23:53.840]  to win it's dastardly and I remember I was noodly armed I could not hit the ball hard
[23:53.840 --> 23:58.560]  but I was I could catch really well I played shortstop I played first base which is super
[23:58.560 --> 24:04.240]  important in little league and I could bunt I could never hit the ball out of the infield
[24:04.240 --> 24:08.240]  but I could make contact so I'd get lucky sometimes in the ball would just find a hole
[24:08.240 --> 24:12.840]  I think I hit like two balls to the outfield in my entire little league career I but I
[24:12.840 --> 24:19.080]  could make contact and I could and I oh and I could get walks I had a good eye so I was
[24:19.080 --> 24:23.320]  a reasonable leadoff batter but I remember my friend James's dad was the coach and he
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.480]  said to me he said I'm gonna bat you lead off this game and I think he's gonna hit you
[24:27.480 --> 24:31.360]  are you okay with that and I was like yeah I could take it and son of a bitch the guy
[24:31.360 --> 24:37.320]  hit me but I I was ready I had the temperament as a kid that I could do it and not cry I
[24:37.320 --> 24:41.000]  mean that's it's super common I coached my kids little league for a while kids get hit
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.640]  they cry even like the best kid in the team you know you because it's scary it's terrifying
[24:44.640 --> 24:53.360]  baseballs are hard of course anyway let's talk apple the big story they've earned it
[24:53.360 --> 24:59.660]  now so we've got this apple on on a this is so such a strange way to release it in my
[24:59.660 --> 25:08.320]  opinion on Thursday night last week late apple issued a press release and with about two
[25:08.320 --> 25:15.760]  hours notice notified some reporters of a conference call where they were going to announce
[25:15.760 --> 25:20.420]  I don't know what they said they were going to announce I was not invited I actually none
[25:20.420 --> 25:27.040]  of the my friends who are fellow Apple journalists were on the call either and it's unclear whether
[25:27.040 --> 25:33.600]  they were invited and just couldn't make it I mean two hours notice is bizarre yeah at
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.920]  night on a Thursday night and on the East Coast it was night yeah something like that
[25:37.920 --> 25:44.360]  really late and simo and then as the call started they released the press release and
[25:44.360 --> 25:54.240]  there's you know what happened is the initial coverage came out with a sort of decided apple
[25:54.240 --> 26:02.720]  see you know can made concessions law you know on this app store bent yeah yeah class
[26:02.720 --> 26:12.960]  action lawsuit and then they had this call and it it's just the timing is so weird because
[26:12.960 --> 26:17.800]  there are things that can happen that have to be released at odd hours right like when
[26:17.800 --> 26:24.600]  Steve Jobs resigned I specifically remember finding out about it I remember it was in
[26:24.600 --> 26:31.040]  August it was actually like 10 years ago last week it's it's or a week or two ago you know
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.360]  literally a 10-year anniversary and I remember I was on vacation with my family at the Jersey
[26:35.360 --> 26:42.240]  Shore with my parents and my sister and her family and you know it's with my parents and
[26:42.240 --> 26:45.040]  we're at the shore and we have there's a bunch of little kids so we were going to dinner
[26:45.040 --> 26:49.120]  early I got on a boardwalk or something you know like probably like five five o'clock
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.560]  at night six maybe six o'clock at night on the East Coast and that's when the news dropped
[26:53.560 --> 26:59.340]  that Steve Jobs was resigning and I was like I can't go to dinner I'm gonna have to write
[26:59.340 --> 27:05.300]  and there there have been many times in my you know family life where I've said I have
[27:05.300 --> 27:12.560]  to drop out of X because I have to work where I've gotten like an eye roll or a come on
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.280]  and when I said it was because Steve Jobs is resigning for his health everybody you
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.640]  know and it's not like my family are diehard Apple people like me but they you know they
[27:19.640 --> 27:26.640]  knew they were like oh oh my god you know do it you know go I remember that well I think
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.400]  I was actually in the UK so it was even weirder time because I thought it was off the clock
[27:30.400 --> 27:34.300]  and then it came in and it was it was like a weird time there too but I also distinctly
[27:34.300 --> 27:38.880]  remember you'll remember this too you know I was I was still sort of a reporter back
[27:38.880 --> 27:46.200]  then in covering Apple and when they disclosed the liver transplant and I don't remember
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.740]  exactly I assume that they sort of did it because the Wall Street Journal if I remember
[27:50.740 --> 27:54.780]  right had broke had gotten the news somehow and so I think that they were either trying
[27:54.780 --> 27:58.980]  to get ahead of it or doing it concurrently with that but that was like also a really
[27:58.980 --> 28:04.500]  late at night on a weekend I think it was like a Friday night literally Friday or Saturday
[28:04.500 --> 28:08.060]  night have been when they when they disclose that yeah and I forget if it was the Wall
[28:08.060 --> 28:12.100]  Street Journal or Bloomberg or somebody somebody got window I think it was the journal but
[28:12.100 --> 28:16.240]  somebody got wind of it yeah that was a weird one too a lot of the Steve Jobs health issues
[28:16.240 --> 28:24.460]  came out at weird times because it was all he was so mercurial and Steve Jobs Ian wanted
[28:24.460 --> 28:31.000]  to be private and maybe was sort of semi in denial about aspects of it and it all of that
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.880]  stuff came out at weird times but I remember the transplant was a weird one too and that's
[28:34.880 --> 28:39.860]  another one where I remember exactly where I was I was with my wife and son at a great
[28:39.860 --> 28:45.700]  place here in Philadelphia called the please touch museum which is just a great place to
[28:45.700 --> 28:49.860]  take kids because everything is literally meant for them to play with and touch and
[28:49.860 --> 28:58.380]  nothing is hands off and you know again I was like I you know I guess I didn't leave
[28:58.380 --> 29:02.860]  you know I was at the museum I was like I don't know you know but I'll start thinking
[29:02.860 --> 29:05.820]  about what this is why I carry a notebook with me wherever it goes start thinking about
[29:05.820 --> 29:09.220]  what I'm gonna write and I didn't really have much to add to that one right like what do
[29:09.220 --> 29:13.380]  you say right that's a tough that was a tough one to write about maybe I just maybe I just
[29:13.380 --> 29:17.660]  linked up the news from my phone actually at the museum I forget but I remember that's
[29:17.660 --> 29:21.380]  where I was when it broke and it was like a Saturday afternoon or something so the Steve
[29:21.380 --> 29:27.300]  Jobs stuff leaked I think I think those things came out at weird hours just because they
[29:27.300 --> 29:33.380]  they came out when reporters got wind of it someone was digging somebody forced Apple's
[29:33.380 --> 29:38.980]  hand whereas this settlement it didn't seem like there was no news that forced their hand
[29:38.980 --> 29:47.540]  right like this was I still don't fully understand it so like I think you so the two hour
[29:47.540 --> 29:52.100]  thing which was reported I think by Jack Nick if I'm saying his name right in the New York
[29:52.100 --> 29:55.040]  Times right that was the first I had heard of that because I didn't talk to anyone who
[29:55.040 --> 29:59.380]  had sort of gotten the call and I also don't know anyone who got the call about the the
[29:59.380 --> 30:04.100]  pre-brief that was happening but basically it's it per that reporting and and you and
[30:04.100 --> 30:07.980]  I you know have been around long enough that I'm sure that this is accurate that they basically
[30:07.980 --> 30:12.380]  gave a two-hour heads up that they were going to announce something and they basically said
[30:12.380 --> 30:16.620]  it sounds like to some of these reporters behind the scenes like look so someone's going
[30:16.620 --> 30:22.360]  to be giving a statement you can't quote it you can't even say who it was who's giving
[30:22.360 --> 30:27.060]  it but if you want to listen in we're going to be doing it in two hours and you know it's
[30:27.060 --> 30:30.440]  probably going to be worth your time type thing and so the reason yeah but what you're
[30:30.440 --> 30:35.020]  getting at is why at that hour especially because the weirdest thing one of the weirdest
[30:35.020 --> 30:40.100]  things to me is they had done a press release earlier that day at normal press release time
[30:40.100 --> 30:46.760]  to talk about the news the Apple news deal that they struck with some publishers to allow
[30:46.760 --> 30:52.420]  them to cut the rate from 30 to 15 percent if they agree to it to include their their
[30:52.420 --> 30:57.520]  content in Apple news and so that was a standard press release which is sort of in line and
[30:57.520 --> 31:02.300]  related to what this this ended up being about so why would they just not bucket them together
[31:02.300 --> 31:07.160]  unless there was something specific about the lawsuit but again it's after sort of working
[31:07.160 --> 31:12.360]  hours did they have to wait until like the legal offices or the court shut down at 6
[31:12.360 --> 31:16.500]  p.m. or something on on the west coast time I don't really understand why they did it
[31:16.500 --> 31:21.900]  other than the sort of cynical view that this was totally manipulated to try to get the
[31:21.900 --> 31:26.620]  headlines that they got off of the the press bingo ding ding ding so the next segment of
[31:26.620 --> 31:30.620]  the show there was a we'd been in at Ben Thompson and I did dithering last night instead of
[31:30.620 --> 31:36.820]  tonight for reasons it the next segment of this show is I'm going to repeat a bit of
[31:36.820 --> 31:41.280]  what I'd said on dithering but I've got so much I can breathe look I can just take a
[31:41.280 --> 31:48.540]  moment and just take a breath you got so much so much room to run give it 20 minutes I think
[31:48.540 --> 31:55.380]  that's exactly I think that's exactly it I think that that Apple strategized a somewhat
[31:55.380 --> 32:02.260]  complex like pool shot like we're gonna bank this in yeah we're gonna bank this the seven
[32:02.260 --> 32:07.220]  ball in off this the rail over there and it's gonna go in the corner pocket and they nailed
[32:07.220 --> 32:14.580]  it and I but there's we still don't know like so Nick has reported that two-hour heads-up
[32:14.580 --> 32:20.280]  thing which is weird usually what they'll say is and they what they'll say on sometimes
[32:20.280 --> 32:26.760]  they'll have if there are external externalities that are forcing their hand they will I've
[32:26.760 --> 32:34.980]  been on calls with Apple that are short notice and and but when the call is short notice
[32:34.980 --> 32:40.360]  they'll say something like we're gonna do a press release tomorrow at 7 a.m. Eastern
[32:40.360 --> 32:45.500]  Time right not the very moment that you're getting on right so to be on this call you're
[32:45.500 --> 32:49.440]  agreeing to the following terms you're not going to quote the call and everything we
[32:49.440 --> 32:55.500]  tell you is under embargo until we release a press release tomorrow at 7 a.m. and sometimes
[32:55.500 --> 32:59.820]  they'll even give you the press release in advance you know and say and they might say
[32:59.820 --> 33:05.220]  this is a draft but they've they've done that too I can't remember specific instances they
[33:05.220 --> 33:13.660]  don't matter but there's you know there is like a an overnight embargo from the thing
[33:13.660 --> 33:18.260]  we don't even know who the executive was and Nick has even said I forget the exact terms
[33:18.260 --> 33:25.860]  I have a guess my guess would be the obvious one of of who is quoted in the actual press
[33:25.860 --> 33:31.060]  release but I don't know what like would they is would they tap would they bring out Schiller
[33:31.060 --> 33:35.020]  to give that that sort of statement verbally when he already is going to be in the press
[33:35.020 --> 33:38.900]  release like I don't know but that would be it would be sort of my guess is it is a way
[33:38.900 --> 33:43.180]  at least to entice some reporters to get on this call that's my guess too honestly but
[33:43.180 --> 33:48.340]  it is truly a guess I really have no idea and it is Schiller who's quoted in the press
[33:48.340 --> 33:55.600]  release and you know who Apple quotes in the press releases is is not random it usually
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.300]  is it's very strategic you know like in the Apple news partner program whatever they call
[34:01.300 --> 34:06.280]  it that was announced earlier in the day on the same day it was Eddie Q who is in charge
[34:06.280 --> 34:13.580]  of that services division it which is not surprising it's you know and it's often it's
[34:13.580 --> 34:19.920]  the same sort of thinking that goes by who gets to be on stage it's you know like somebody
[34:19.920 --> 34:27.420]  else told me it said years ago about the Beatles and all their songs were credited to Lennon
[34:27.420 --> 34:33.220]  McCartney but everybody knows that there were Lennon songs that McCartney helped him with
[34:33.220 --> 34:37.380]  and McCartney songs that Lennon helped them with and that the way to know is whoever read
[34:37.380 --> 34:44.620]  it spit it right whoever sung the song that was their song and whoever is on stage is
[34:44.620 --> 34:52.020]  it on an Apple event or you know on camera in the recent ones is responsible maybe not
[34:52.020 --> 34:58.760]  the point person for it because they've expanded to to lower ranked people to get more more
[34:58.760 --> 35:04.740]  employees there but whoever the person is they're they are they have been hands-on with
[35:04.740 --> 35:09.140]  whatever it is they're talking about yes and they they're likely the final sign off you
[35:09.140 --> 35:13.640]  know like because Tim Cook you know obviously can veto anything but he's probably not going
[35:13.640 --> 35:18.240]  to get into the the weeds over you know Schiller or Eddie Q who have been around just as long
[35:18.240 --> 35:26.580]  as him who who knows right like a couple recent events like when they announced the the first
[35:26.580 --> 35:32.240]  retina MacBook Air which was like the big finally a retina MacBook Air Laura Legros
[35:32.240 --> 35:38.020]  was the person announcing it and she's since been back to announce I forget if she was
[35:38.020 --> 35:44.160]  there for the m1s but you know she she is she's like a she's in charge of the consumer
[35:44.160 --> 35:49.600]  you know like the MacBook Airs you know that that that is her thing you know right and
[35:49.600 --> 35:58.000]  so quoting Schiller he is he he is still his his retitling to Apple fellow and and I love
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.340]  a promotion of Jaws to Schiller's longtime title of senior vice president of worldwide
[36:04.340 --> 36:13.040]  marketing he is still in charge of the App Store and it's not just like a titular thing
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.320]  he really is so it's not surprising he was quoted so I guess he was the one and it seems
[36:18.320 --> 36:25.220]  like that is what would entice them and he would be very good you know like it's so whoever
[36:25.220 --> 36:34.440]  was on the call really did paint a story that that got published he'd be good at that so
[36:34.440 --> 36:41.560]  my guess is Schiller but I have no idea and yeah and the so I actually so I wrote something
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.920]  about it a couple days ago which I think you know and then I actually wrote something again
[36:45.920 --> 36:49.840]  last night based off the two-hour thing just trying to you know have fun with and extrapolate
[36:49.840 --> 36:53.680]  out how I think that call would have went down basically along the lines of what we're
[36:53.680 --> 36:58.800]  talking about where it's like okay so the reporters get on the Apple executive joins
[36:58.800 --> 37:03.260]  you know Apple PR is obviously on the line and the executive basically reads the statements
[37:03.260 --> 37:07.680]  which is exactly in line with the press release again the press not knowing that the press
[37:07.680 --> 37:13.100]  release is about to be dropped and then you know ends it and then someone you can imagine
[37:13.100 --> 37:17.240]  like wants to jump in with a question and then Apple PR instead sort of interjecting
[37:17.240 --> 37:22.080]  and saying like well that's all for today you know we're happy to try to set something
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.560]  up you know if you have more questions about it but right now the the news is actually
[37:25.560 --> 37:30.180]  out there it's just been released on the websites and so you should you should go read that
[37:30.180 --> 37:33.880]  and let us know if you have any questions and thanks and good night and then basically
[37:33.880 --> 37:37.600]  that's it and it's putting all the pressure in the world on the reporters to basically
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.440]  get their stories up because they have to compete now with Apple's actual released press
[37:42.440 --> 37:46.600]  release again to the points that you were making earlier which is a little bit abnormal
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.760]  to release it while you're in the middle of a call and so time was of the essence and
[37:50.760 --> 37:54.760]  it's it just puts immense pressure and that's why you get the stories and even I was I was
[37:54.760 --> 37:58.640]  fooled by you know I sent a tweet immediately when I saw the the press release said it's
[37:58.640 --> 38:04.240]  like wow was this a Thursday night news dump or what and it you know but it looked like
[38:04.240 --> 38:09.120]  it was going to be Apple conceding you know because that's what the the initial headlines
[38:09.120 --> 38:13.760]  basically made it seem like that Apple was was giving in on some of their long-standing
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.620]  things you know the App Store cut and and everything else and instead and we'll talk
[38:18.620 --> 38:22.580]  about it I mean it ended up being a big nothing burger here are the headlines the initial
[38:22.580 --> 38:28.060]  headlines Washington Post who I think really shit the bed the most on this Apple loosens
[38:28.060 --> 38:35.760]  rules for developers in major concession amid antitrust pressure that that that is a shit
[38:35.760 --> 38:40.180]  the pants headline right there I mean there's just no argument about Wall Street Journal
[38:40.180 --> 38:47.760]  Apple set to let app developers alert users to alternate payment methods not bad but actually
[38:47.760 --> 38:56.440]  it's a little bit yeah it's not it's not direct it's it can be it can be correct technically
[38:56.440 --> 39:01.260]  but it's not directional it's not what the it doesn't give you right tell me this tell
[39:01.260 --> 39:06.580]  me the basic gist in one sentence that's not it whilst or no I did that financial times
[39:06.580 --> 39:14.060]  Apple makes App Store concession on payments no they did not false the verge Apple finally
[39:14.060 --> 39:21.380]  agrees to let app developers communicate with their customers hmm sorry and I mean that's
[39:21.380 --> 39:27.420]  a little bit gray right because like and we can get into this like how how much of that
[39:27.420 --> 39:32.860]  the most interesting part of that press release is the fact that they use the word clarification
[39:32.860 --> 39:38.340]  right it was about clarifying it wasn't about changing anything it was literally clarifying
[39:38.340 --> 39:43.980]  indicating that you could oh we always thought you could do this oh okay that's interesting
[39:43.980 --> 39:50.420]  not everyone knew that CNET in major policy change Apple will allow developers to email
[39:50.420 --> 39:55.540]  customers about alternatives to App Store billing that's not a major policy change so
[39:55.540 --> 40:03.140]  uh so who here's who got it right uh Mark Bloomberg reporting for for uh Mark Gurman
[40:03.140 --> 40:09.940]  reporting for Bloomberg Tim Apple nice all right uh Mark Gurman got it right the headline
[40:09.940 --> 40:17.060]  at Bloomberg was Apple settles with developers without making major concessions well that
[40:17.060 --> 40:21.580]  that gets it that that's the story what's the one sentence summary Apple settles with
[40:21.580 --> 40:27.340]  app developers without making major concessions that's the story and so it'd be with that
[40:27.340 --> 40:30.380]  it would be fascinating to know if Gurman was on the call presumably not I think he
[40:30.380 --> 40:33.660]  has like a sort of a love-hate relationship right with Apple given all the the news he
[40:33.660 --> 40:38.020]  breaks and I'm assuming they don't love that but I don't know we could ask him obviously
[40:38.020 --> 40:42.900]  if he was if he was on that but presumably he wasn't because all you had to do if you
[40:42.900 --> 40:46.860]  weren't on that call you actually were at an advantage in a way right because you just
[40:46.860 --> 40:51.660]  read the press release and if you're in if you're versed enough in Apple as Gurman is
[40:51.660 --> 40:55.820]  as you are as hopefully I still am in some regard because again that's what I did I read
[40:55.820 --> 40:59.580]  the press release after that initial tweet and I'm like what this is nothing this is
[40:59.580 --> 41:03.620]  this is literally not any different than than what has been going on and so yeah again the
[41:03.620 --> 41:08.780]  people who were not on the call were at an advantage yeah so I think what Apple's strategy
[41:08.780 --> 41:15.180]  was here and like I said there's a it's not it's devilish in its effectiveness it worked
[41:15.180 --> 41:23.180]  I mean it worked unbelievably well but it's it's like it is sort of a Rube Goldbergian
[41:23.180 --> 41:31.020]  there's four or five aspects to it but I think the largest part of it hinges on using the
[41:31.020 --> 41:40.460]  major media's biases and proclivities against them like judo one of them is knowing that
[41:40.460 --> 41:44.820]  they would be in a rush to get something up and so they would they they might be susceptible
[41:44.820 --> 41:50.700]  to taking the top line spin but like I said I'm dithering you know there's this this thing
[41:50.700 --> 41:54.140]  that's annoyed me they've and a couple of I think I even saw the New York Times start
[41:54.140 --> 41:58.340]  doing it but I know the Post does it too where they they're they're referring to big tech
[41:58.340 --> 42:08.620]  with a capital B and a capital T right Apple Facebook Google Microsoft Amazon and I don't
[42:08.620 --> 42:13.300]  know who else I guess they're counting Twitter gets in there somehow because Twitter's in
[42:13.300 --> 42:17.580]  the media's you know financially Twitter isn't up there muzzling and all that but like you
[42:17.580 --> 42:21.740]  know but they're important for yeah speech yeah I think that's all of them did I miss
[42:21.740 --> 42:27.020]  any of them you know there's the ones that get thrown in there every once in a while
[42:27.020 --> 42:33.220]  but I think those are the major ones so they call it big tech and they're on an anti big
[42:33.220 --> 42:42.980]  tech crusade which I truly believe truly colors their their news coverage in in a biased way
[42:42.980 --> 42:48.420]  that these companies are too influential that they should be broken up that that sort of
[42:48.420 --> 42:52.500]  thinking and and the the thing I'm gonna try to make this the thing at least on Daring
[42:52.500 --> 43:00.800]  Fireball but the the outlets that are in that charge I'm calling big press okay and like
[43:00.800 --> 43:06.940]  it that I think that I think that's only who they invited on the call I think they they
[43:06.940 --> 43:12.260]  and one thing that you and I know that Apple PR does is and to to a certain degree with
[43:12.260 --> 43:16.820]  big press with like the New York Times and Washington Post etc though at Wall Street
[43:16.820 --> 43:23.820]  Journal for sure Apple has less influence on on what I'm about to say but but they don't
[43:23.820 --> 43:30.780]  really pick outlets so much as they are there are individual orders yep right and so like
[43:30.780 --> 43:38.820]  a panzerino has a better relationship with Apple than TechCrunch as a whole right you
[43:38.820 --> 43:43.220]  did when you were at TechCrunch right and that was actually that was a very key point
[43:43.220 --> 43:49.380]  because TechCrunch had a horrible relationship with Apple you know before I had started I
[43:49.380 --> 43:54.140]  think Harrington maybe had broken some sorry about an iPad prototype or something like
[43:54.140 --> 43:58.940]  that that they were all pissed off about and so yeah it took it took a you know a bunch
[43:58.940 --> 44:04.900]  of time to sort of establish you know being okay with each other once again and yeah panzerino
[44:04.900 --> 44:10.220]  now carries that torch obviously right and I don't know how that works with exactly with
[44:10.220 --> 44:17.220]  like the Times like I don't think the Times would be so amenable to you know one person
[44:17.220 --> 44:23.100]  is like that one person but even there they you know they they'd still you know even like
[44:23.100 --> 44:27.820]  the New York Times doesn't get like unlimited invitations to press events but whoever they
[44:27.820 --> 44:33.580]  reached out to I think they hand selected I think and I think that the reporters and
[44:33.580 --> 44:44.300]  the editors involved were open to a Apple concedes you know major concessions from Apple
[44:44.300 --> 44:51.400]  amid antitrust concerns right that sort of slant played into what they wanted to be true
[44:51.400 --> 45:00.920]  and and doing it late at night all of a sudden in a seemingly embarrassed way with a press
[45:00.920 --> 45:07.740]  release that at a glance seemed like it had a bunch of concessions all made it seem like
[45:07.740 --> 45:14.260]  bingo we got him you were right we did our jobs and now we get to report on it that you
[45:14.260 --> 45:19.900]  know that we were victorious and so in some regard right I totally agree with that and
[45:19.900 --> 45:25.700]  the fascinating I mean if that is the case if that is the way that this played out it
[45:25.700 --> 45:30.020]  really is sort of ingenious by Apple and you know we can talk about whether it's ethically
[45:30.020 --> 45:34.260]  right or not to do it this way and I and I have a hard time with sort of this this level
[45:34.260 --> 45:40.500]  of PR manipulation but I do think it was rather ingenious and that it worked because it also
[45:40.500 --> 45:45.260]  what their audience really was here is is the court system is that judge who's who's
[45:45.260 --> 45:50.900]  also good the one who's presiding over the epic case right and the lawmakers and you
[45:50.900 --> 45:56.140]  saw tweets from Amy Klobuchar and on down right about like this is a great first step
[45:56.140 --> 46:02.540]  like is it really is it any step it's nothing senator Blumenthal who I believe is from Connecticut
[46:02.540 --> 46:08.380]  who I think co-wrote some of the legislation with Klobuchar he he had a very similar take
[46:08.380 --> 46:12.800]  that this is just you know see the our pressure is working this is a good first step we're
[46:12.800 --> 46:17.740]  not done yet there's more to come but you know this is a good first step that sort of
[46:17.740 --> 46:26.860]  thing and it didn't take long I mean and one thing that was for sure is instantly my the
[46:26.860 --> 46:32.420]  Apple to third-party developer Twitter for lack of a better term instantly got it right
[46:32.420 --> 46:39.580]  got sniffed you got yeah you got such a better reaction right off the bat from I in fact
[46:39.580 --> 46:44.420]  I didn't see any ice I follow so many some of them friends some of them people who I
[46:44.420 --> 46:48.660]  just know who they are but I don't know him personally I didn't see one who thought this
[46:48.660 --> 46:52.580]  was a victory I every single one of them looked at course because they live and breathe this
[46:52.580 --> 46:58.140]  stuff they are in such the minutia and the details that they know that like what you
[46:58.140 --> 47:02.460]  know Apple's major concession here wasn't they didn't even in the press release they
[47:02.460 --> 47:07.760]  don't even say it's a concession they say it's a clarification it's ridiculous let me
[47:07.760 --> 47:12.340]  take a break and we'll keep going on this but let me tell you about Mack Weldon oh man
[47:12.340 --> 47:18.700]  do I love Mack Weldon clothes it's so much more than just underwear their full collection

[49:06.460 --> 49:11.580]  and are pissed yeah yeah and feel insulted and and that is sort of your take i don't
[49:11.580 --> 49:18.260]  want to regurgitate your initial blog post but you you you you summed up i thought as
[49:18.260 --> 49:22.060]  one of the i thought oh god i got to see if i can get mg on the show because this is the
[49:22.060 --> 49:33.540]  attitude right it was insulting right it yeah it's i mean it's it's it really is it's bullshit
[49:33.540 --> 49:42.240]  because they are trying to manipulate the situation knowing that they're in a position
[49:42.240 --> 49:46.440]  of strength which you know like i mean is a is a what is a two and a half trillion dollar
[49:46.440 --> 49:52.100]  company ever not in a position of strength um and but here you know they they know like with
[49:52.100 --> 49:56.020]  this this clash action lawsuit you know they're probably even still in a position of strength
[49:56.020 --> 49:59.740]  they don't need to do anything but this always this goes back to something you and i've talked
[49:59.740 --> 50:03.380]  about for i think years at this point it's all it's it comes down to still reading the
[50:03.380 --> 50:09.300]  room right and like apple is just not very good for whatever reason in the later stages
[50:09.300 --> 50:15.980]  of their their transition to you know goliath uh from from the david position and and i'm
[50:15.980 --> 50:19.700]  sure that that's related to it they're just not good at sort of taking the temperature
[50:19.700 --> 50:24.340]  and reading the room and knowing what ultimately the reaction will be amongst the people who
[50:24.340 --> 50:28.940]  should matter if not the most i would say maybe the customers matter the most but you
[50:28.940 --> 50:33.420]  know the developers are at least right up there in line with the customers because it's
[50:33.420 --> 50:37.520]  all part of the same system that makes the entire thing work and hum and if they keep
[50:37.520 --> 50:43.220]  losing and keep sort of pissing off the developer community eventually that has ramifications
[50:43.220 --> 50:47.260]  with the customers and with everything else and with you know legislation and all the
[50:47.260 --> 50:52.060]  stuff going on now it's like apple is not doing themselves any favors and you understand
[50:52.060 --> 50:57.540]  why at a high level of course it's like it does unfortunately seem to come down to the
[50:57.540 --> 51:02.460]  bottom line for some of these decisions that they make but you would hope and you and i
[51:02.460 --> 51:08.420]  i know are both in the same camp that we hope where ultimately you know product decisions
[51:08.420 --> 51:14.420]  should be what's driving apple and in this case what i boil this down to is basically
[51:14.420 --> 51:17.940]  look we can argue about like what the cut should be it was always made up to begin with
[51:17.940 --> 51:21.260]  sort of dating you know some of it dates to video games some of the dates to itunes you
[51:21.260 --> 51:24.900]  know sort of pulling numbers out of the sky and and not thinking that that the app store
[51:24.900 --> 51:28.500]  would ever be a massive business famously jobs talking about running it as break even
[51:28.500 --> 51:33.380]  and obviously it's no longer that by many orders of magnitude ultimately the cut is
[51:33.380 --> 51:37.260]  less important whatever it ends up being i do think that they need to reduce it and they
[51:37.260 --> 51:40.600]  will reduce it i think they're going to do more deals like they're doing with publishers
[51:40.600 --> 51:44.400]  and like they do with some of the the video streamers to basically give something and
[51:44.400 --> 51:48.580]  take something so if you put your your wares on this store then we'll give you a cut a
[51:48.580 --> 51:52.660]  better cut or whatever i think that's ultimately how it plays out but i do think at the end
[51:52.660 --> 51:57.460]  of the day what it really should be it should be about more than the cut it should be that
[51:57.460 --> 52:02.940]  basically my viewpoint very strongly now is that apple should compete on the product side
[52:02.940 --> 52:08.460]  and allow other payment processors within their own apps and just say look you can you
[52:08.460 --> 52:12.700]  can have your payment processor in here we're going to compete by offering the best one
[52:12.700 --> 52:17.180]  and we have sort of even if we have access to apis that you don't have access to necessarily
[52:17.180 --> 52:21.920]  yet we're going to let your payment processor be here and and you can you know you can have
[52:21.920 --> 52:25.760]  your customers use it if they choose to do that but we're going to compete by saying
[52:25.760 --> 52:29.500]  like it's so much more seamless to use apple pay so why wouldn't you do that and i'm in
[52:29.500 --> 52:33.700]  the boat like i love apple pay i would probably use it over another payment processor right
[52:33.700 --> 52:37.780]  and that's i think a lot of apple's customers would be in that boat and you you should leave
[52:37.780 --> 52:42.140]  it on the you know whoever else the other payment processors or the developers of that
[52:42.140 --> 52:47.940]  app to sort of entice whatever sort of reasons they want people to use that other service
[52:47.940 --> 52:52.660]  like yeah give it give it leave it up to them but at the end of the day if it's just easier
[52:52.660 --> 52:55.460]  to use apple pay a lot of people are going to use apple pay that's the way it should
[52:55.460 --> 53:02.640]  be uh let's put a i want to come back to that point on the payment processors in particular
[53:02.640 --> 53:11.680]  but it it the the galling part of the announcement is and i think i think culturally it's twofold
[53:11.680 --> 53:20.020]  i think one it's always hard for the the goliath to have sympathy for the davids even if they're
[53:20.020 --> 53:26.380]  not you know the the the company on top the favorite you know apple to me has always been
[53:26.380 --> 53:34.380]  at its best when it's the underdog and even in uh i'm trying to think of a good example
[53:34.380 --> 53:40.760]  but you know apple tv plus is a good example right apple tv plus is doing pretty well and
[53:40.760 --> 53:47.440]  it's a pretty you know five bucks a month and put it in with uh uh the bundle with apple
[53:47.440 --> 53:53.580]  one it's a it really is a legitimately good value and the shows are really good i and
[53:53.580 --> 53:57.260]  you know they're the underdog right they're they're they're not hbo they're you and i
[53:57.260 --> 54:01.780]  that's what we talked about last year was hbo and and can they become hbo yeah exactly
[54:01.780 --> 54:06.780]  right yep and and disney plus right i mean you know that did this you know disney plus
[54:06.780 --> 54:15.420]  is kicking ass in my opinion and but it's it's disney's core competency is making entertainment
[54:15.420 --> 54:22.900]  family-friendly entertainment with memorable characters and content that will last for
[54:22.900 --> 54:29.620]  decades that is that's disney that's been disney since like 1927 or whenever steamboat
[54:29.620 --> 54:36.520]  willie appeared uh that's their core company apple tv plus is new to apple they're the
[54:36.520 --> 54:41.340]  underdog and it's to me one of the best things they've done in recent years you know that
[54:41.340 --> 54:46.500]  and it's hard to do that when you're on top right and when were apple's developer relations
[54:46.500 --> 54:50.820]  the best well they've always been contentious right there's never been a time when developers
[54:50.820 --> 54:56.020]  didn't have serious legitimate complaints about apple developer relations i know this
[54:56.020 --> 55:01.180]  i've been part of the apple developer community i when i wanted to be part of it even before
[55:01.180 --> 55:07.460]  i was part of it in the 90s i i just craved it i i followed it um it's always and i do
[55:07.460 --> 55:11.260]  think that that is part of it too that inside apple they're like ah developers are always
[55:11.260 --> 55:16.140]  belly aching they've always been belly even belly aching since the first wwdc right this
[55:16.140 --> 55:21.180]  won't matter 30 years because they've always done this yeah yeah right um but it was different
[55:21.180 --> 55:26.220]  when they needed developers to hustle right like and apple's developer relations and and
[55:26.220 --> 55:30.280]  they're making developers say hey this is actually pretty cool and exciting and i'm
[55:30.280 --> 55:37.020]  enjoying my my work i'm enjoying making this was when they really needed them like the
[55:37.020 --> 55:43.240]  early days of mac os 10 when they needed all developers to rewrite their apps because you
[55:43.240 --> 55:48.980]  either a were like uh had a big well-known app or any app like a carbon app but like
[55:48.980 --> 55:53.900]  you were adobe you were microsoft you had photoshop you had microsoft office and apple
[55:53.900 --> 55:58.740]  needed those apps to be on mac that's what led to the bill gates uh big brother icon
[55:58.740 --> 56:04.540]  yeah right and and absolutely mac os 10 would not have worked without photoshop and office
[56:04.540 --> 56:07.580]  right it just wouldn't it would it would have been dead on arrival and everybody would have
[56:07.580 --> 56:13.260]  stuck with mac os 9 and there you know that's why apple didn't just cancel classic mac os
[56:13.260 --> 56:18.000]  there was like a four-year overlap of both of them being supported and you could buy
[56:18.000 --> 56:24.420]  new machines and reinstall the os and put you know switch from mac os 10 to mac os 9
[56:24.420 --> 56:31.980]  because they knew that it you know it was a really hard transition so they needed carbon
[56:31.980 --> 56:37.340]  they needed carbon apps or classic mac os apps to be rewritten significantly not like
[56:37.340 --> 56:43.420]  rewritten from scratch but it was a lot of work for classic mac os apps to be native
[56:43.420 --> 56:49.700]  carbon apps on mac os 10 as opposed to if if you're not a long time mac user 20 years
[56:49.700 --> 56:55.780]  ago um there was a classic environment where you could run unaltered apps and and they
[56:55.780 --> 57:01.240]  ran in they ran side by side it wasn't like they ran in a separate window or you had to
[57:01.240 --> 57:06.580]  like use screens to to go over to a different desktop to get to them you know you could
[57:06.580 --> 57:12.240]  command tab to them and their windows would be interleaved but they looked like old apps
[57:12.240 --> 57:17.900]  they they had you know the the old style classic mac os look to get the new look and to take
[57:17.900 --> 57:22.540]  advantage of the features developers had to do a lot of work and apple did a lot to make
[57:22.540 --> 57:31.380]  that happen and you know it was a next person uh scott forestall who who made carbon happen
[57:31.380 --> 57:35.500]  and you know and everybody thinks like oh the next crew wanted everybody to just rewrite
[57:35.500 --> 57:38.780]  everything in cocoa which was their initial plan because it would have been a lot less
[57:38.780 --> 57:43.220]  work and they would have shipped sooner and they loved cocoa and they knew cocoa and those
[57:43.220 --> 57:47.860]  apis were awesome and they knew that that's the whole reason apple bought next is is that
[57:47.860 --> 57:54.500]  this framework was just so good and enabled developers to do so much so much faster and
[57:54.500 --> 58:01.740]  to have one person teams create apps that would have taken dozens of people before they
[58:01.740 --> 58:05.380]  knew that and they thought well everybody will just love it and you know you know what
[58:05.380 --> 58:09.680]  developers don't like being told is you have to rewrite your app using an entirely new
[58:09.680 --> 58:15.340]  language entirely new frameworks didn't work scott forestall led the way to make carbon
[58:15.340 --> 58:19.780]  happen was a ton of work but they also wanted still wanted to they didn't say okay we'll
[58:19.780 --> 58:24.660]  we'll throw cocoa out and we'll just use this carbon thing there they still wanted everybody
[58:24.660 --> 58:30.540]  to go eventually to cocoa and for years it was a you know easy you know arguably a 10-year
[58:30.540 --> 58:35.820]  transition apple was great at that and yes there were parts that were terrible you know
[58:35.820 --> 58:41.780]  like they i this is way out in the weeds but you know there was a time when 64-bit carbon
[58:41.780 --> 58:48.420]  was a thing and adobe for one was counting on it and all of a sudden one wwdc apple said
[58:48.420 --> 58:53.700]  you know what that 64-bit carbon uh thing we promised uh that's not gonna happen carbon
[58:53.700 --> 59:00.260]  is is officially deprecated and it will only be 32-bit and eventually the os is going to
[59:00.260 --> 59:06.780]  go 64-bit only um so get your shit together and you know so there were there i'm not saying
[59:06.780 --> 59:11.220]  again developers have had complaints right like that's and that's a legit complaint you
[59:11.220 --> 59:17.280]  told us 64-bit carbon was going to be a thing we made years-long plans about it and now
[59:17.280 --> 59:22.280]  you're yanking the carpet it happened but overall developers they'd get into cocoa and
[59:22.280 --> 59:27.120]  they'd say this is great i really love it this is making me happy i i enjoy my days
[59:27.120 --> 59:33.180]  as a programmer writing this thing apple was the underdog they needed developers right
[59:33.180 --> 59:38.040]  now that they don't need them the attitude is a little different and i think the other
[59:38.040 --> 59:43.860]  thing that hurts apple culturally is is a thing that is overall a tremendous strength
[59:43.860 --> 59:50.380]  for the company is that people who succeed at apple stay there for their careers and
[59:50.380 --> 01:00:00.500]  largely right jaws has been there for since he was like 10 years old uh pretty much another
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:09.660]  michigan guy i like jaws yeah uh yeah definitely a michigan guy um it uh uh no but you're brian
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:14.080]  detero brian and this is maybe this is an aside but these are the people that you're
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.220]  talking about now are the ones i don't know if you happen to see german's newsletter he's
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.420]  talking about the succession planning of when cook retires um you know if he does in five
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:25.700]  years or whatever or or less um and it's exactly the people you're talking about right because
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:30.740]  it's basically the lifers it's the people who've been there 20 30 years um eddie q phil
[01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:36.820]  schiller phil schiller was arguably a late comer because he was at macromedia for a while
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.980]  and came you know but he was there by the time steve jobs got there you know he was
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:47.820]  still predates the next reunification these people have been there for 25 to 30 years
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:55.300]  and it the the underdog mentality is sort of infused in them right i remember i think
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:01.660]  they do still see themselves as underdogs yep i think that that's totally right and
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:06.740]  the problem is the company is so much bigger now than it was then like how many i don't
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.440]  know how many employees they have but i mean not including apple store employees they still
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:17.980]  must have 80 90 100 000 people you know who work there and um it's just like the vast
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:24.340]  majority you know 99 say don't remember that world you know sort of while the key executives
[01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:29.180]  do the vast majority of the company the the the memory and apple university you know tries
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.580]  to instill some of this stuff but it's not it's not a lived experience right i you know
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.540]  even with retail it's like the early days of retail i still remember going to the mall
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:45.220]  the rockingham mall and uh i think it's in new hampshire i was living in and at the border
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:50.000]  of massachusetts and new hampshire at the time uh and hearing over and over and over
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.180]  again people saying that they're going to the ipod store yeah and it's like yeah they
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:02.740]  were they were the underdog but it's it it doesn't suit them well now when doing handling
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:10.060]  something like this suit and on the other hand too even if apple had more of a re a
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:15.160]  better ability to read the room to as you say and and to see how this would play with
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:23.500]  everybody i do also see and sympathize to some degree with the fact that their priorities
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:32.620]  are always have been apple first users second developers third always and and it and i am
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.580]  friends with developers i have been a developer i have had an app and you know i've worked
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:42.640]  at at apple developers i sympathize but it is the right order the company needs to look
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:47.080]  out for itself first you're you're that's that's the nature of capitalism and right
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:56.740]  but you but you kind of have to remember the the developers right because it it's like
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:01.980]  if that's your your priorities company first user second developers third you have to be
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:08.160]  cognizant of of that fact and and because they all tie into each other yeah and i totally
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.220]  agree and another point like that is often brought up and i think is accurate is that
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.120]  you know more so than than maybe any other company certainly any of the big ones that
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.160]  we know today apple did almost die and there are some people who are still there who were
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.560]  there when they almost died and so when you talk about you know it sounds selfish to say
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.160]  that a company needs to look after itself first but that's really where that comes from
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.280]  right like they know that they can't put themselves in the precarious situations that they did
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:38.560]  back in the 90s that put them almost on the you know the doorstep of death and so uh it's
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:45.840]  even more ingrained from that leadership group i think yeah um but boy the optics i i do
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.840]  think that it could have been played better right like and so i do see how apple wants
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.760]  to wanted to use this settlement which is just a proposal like uh judge i i do forget
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.800]  her name uh i don't have it off the top of my head but it's the same one who's presiding
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:11.360]  over the the epic trial right yep um it's just a proposal i do believe it will be accepted
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:17.660]  um it seems like it has to be unless some of the backlash to like exactly what we're
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:23.120]  talking about now like persuades them i don't really know if that even would be viable like
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.480]  it's not legally it seems like they apple was in a good footing again in this case as
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.560]  it seems like they are in the epic side too but it's it's more than just like the legal
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.920]  side is not their issue right it's the perception side judge ivan gonzalez rogers and she goes
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:45.240]  by gonzalez rogers without a without a hyphen um i i do understand how they wanted to take
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.180]  this settlement and because i think the truth here's the truth of it the truth of it the
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:54.080]  other and this is the other aspect that i cannot believe that the reporters who fell
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:00.280]  for this as major concessions did not get class action lawsuits are at least 90 percent
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:08.720]  bullshit uh maybe maybe i'm underestimating what percentage the idea is great and there
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:15.320]  are cases where class action lawsuits are totally legitimate and the victims do get
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.800]  a reasonable or appropriate or just compensation and that's what you want right it's called
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:27.160]  the justice system you you want the right thing to happen when wrongdoing has been proven
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:32.320]  in court and class action lawsuits on paper and in theory and this is where developers
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:37.320]  go wrong because developers are so logical right and that's what makes them my friends
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.920]  and that's why they're developers and that's why their code can compile and run is they
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.440]  are good at logic and the logic is if there's this thing called class action lawsuits where
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:56.400]  a bunch of small guys can uh band together and collectively sue a large company who has
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.560]  done them wrong and then get compensation from it it should work out in a just way and
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.480]  the right thing should be should be the outcome at 90 percent of the time class action lawsuits
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:13.200]  are just nonsense and they're just it's just a racket run by lawyers and i'm not anti-lawyer
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.600]  my wife is a lawyer i'm not somebody who just rants that all lawyers are bogus but class
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:22.600]  action lawsuits are run by the sort of typically run by the type of lawyers who give lawyers
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.720]  a bad name in the general public and make people think bad of lawyers in general and
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.240]  they're in it for the money and maybe not nonsense nonsense like out of thin air but
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.200]  like the stupid uh battery gate thing where there's a class action lawsuit where apple
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.080]  you know it sounds good on the surface that's the basis of all class action lawsuits even
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:47.520]  the nonsense ones is something that sounds good on purpose right like oh apple slows
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:55.400]  down four-year-old iphones be to get people to buy new iphones uh with software updates
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.760]  you install a software update and then they slow down your iphone to trick you into buying
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.520]  a new iphone well that sounds dastardly we should sue them but the truth of the matter
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.040]  was they they were literally doing the opposite they were trying they did this to extend the
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.720]  life of to keep phones running and and if they ran them at the full speed the battery
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.920]  couldn't supply sufficient power to run it at full speed the phone would shut down it
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:23.520]  wasn't just like oh you know they were trying to give you eight hours of battery life by
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.200]  slowing it down you would have got seven it wasn't like you'd get seven it was phones
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.120]  were literally iphones were shutting down early because if they ran at full throttle
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.860]  the battery was no longer it had let's say the battery says it's at 78 but the battery
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:43.560]  was so old that it no longer could provide the full uh voltage wattage whatever the electrical
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:48.280]  engineering term was to run the cpu at full full speed and the phone would just shut down
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.080]  and so they tried you know they had software update it was nonsense the suit was based
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:59.360]  on the misconception that's just one example that's a nonsense suit this suit i don't think
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.160]  they were going to win and i think reading between the lines it was we we were going
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.220]  to this this suit had no legs we were going to win uh so here's here's a hundred million
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:14.160]  dollars to make you feel good enjoy um let me ask you this why do you think what is it
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.240]  from apple's perspective that they don't this is a bit of an extreme one but it's still
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:25.000]  it's it's maybe illustrative of of the situation why don't they do something that's a more
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.200]  more proactive major change not all of them not not conceding on every point but just
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:36.400]  doing something that's a that's a major change to try to placate some groups whether it's
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.840]  developers whether it's the legislative set like get out ahead of this stuff right and
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.600]  like again you is it because it's the slippery slope and they're then they're gonna have
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.640]  to change other things and they just like what is it from your point of view that they
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:52.720]  don't do that i i don't know i really don't to me you know and i i also think one of the
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.120]  other things i think apple would have won this lawsuit um so they don't want to like
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.200]  concede for something that they know that they were gonna they're gonna win right because
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:09.720]  yeah they were they were going to win i now i wonder how much their their epic lawsuit
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.640]  which is very you know it's still open it hasn't been decided supposedly coming soon
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:20.720]  but you know all of the unpleasant uh emails that have come out right as evidence and and
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:25.520]  they don't like testifying i mean they looked miserable i mean that's the most insane thing
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.880]  about this epic lawsuit is the fact that apple let it go forward like what are they thinking
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.760]  i have never seen craig federighi look anything other than upbeat and optimistic and when
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.520]  he you know him wearing a suit he he looked like he was going to a funeral i mean you
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.120]  know pictures of him entering the courtroom it and it i think he even said in an interview
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.800]  something you know it's it's unpleasant nobody nobody wants to testify in court about this
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.080]  stuff uh they they all have and they all have better stuff to do it's it's terrible but
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.920]  i can't help but think that that's part of it is that they just wanted to settle this
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:03.020]  to get it over with i think they knew they were going to win i there's no real legal
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.880]  grounds for this stuff you can say on some sort of moral ethical the right way to do
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.760]  capitalism right way to do by your developer community that apple isn't doing the right
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.200]  thing but i don't think any of it comes close to being illegal i think some of the steering
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.080]  stuff maybe which is why that got some attention um i i'm not trying to say that with a blanket
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.520]  for everything but on the whole apple was on very good ground with with this but i think
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.440]  rather than fight it and pay nothing and say here we go wash our hands we blew them away
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.840]  yeah they might have done it even without the lawsuit but it's sort of like if if the
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:44.700]  the varsity team is playing the eighth grade team you you don't play as hard as you can
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.840]  you know what i mean you don't you know it's you you let up a little bit you don't you
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.560]  don't start knocking the kids around you know it's it's a bad look it's a it's a great point
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.360]  because it's basically exactly what we're talking about they have a strong it seems
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.200]  like they have strong uh legal footing on all of these cases that are major um the issue
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.980]  is no longer legal though it's it's becoming a perception issue and it ultimately doesn't
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:14.680]  matter if they are going to be sort of uh you know legislated in in some ways and and
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.080]  you know as we talked about earlier all these different parties have the certainly will
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.840]  and desire to do so and they think their constituents want them to do this and so like we're going
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.720]  down that path whether or not it's legally viable like they're going to change the laws
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:32.360]  if it's not legally viable so like you know apple has to recognize that and obviously
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.500]  they do they have smart people but like they just don't want to i don't i i don't know
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.640]  if they just don't want to be the make the first move um proactively because they view
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.400]  that as a sign of weakness and because it's a slippery slope that they worry that if you
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.840]  give them as a cookie you know that we're gonna we're gonna end up like with all sorts
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:54.840]  of stuff that they don't want but they really run a real risk of on the legislation slide
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.960]  side and uh and of course the perception side that we've been talking about well as an outside
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.040]  observer i have to say i love the apple epic lawsuit because of all the stuff that came
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:10.560]  out right it's amazing content yeah it's amazing stuff i mean you had eddie q uh pushing for
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.240]  iMessage for android and and admitting that iMessage at the time at 2013 or whenever it
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:24.040]  was didn't really cost the company that much um uh and then Federighi saying well i don't
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:27.920]  i'm not quite sure what iMessage for android would do other than make it easier for parents
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.280]  to buy android phones for their kids and keep them in the group uh you know but not surprising
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.240]  but it's the sort of discussions you presume they've had and it's amazing to see it in
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.460]  writing yeah the most extraordinary thing to come out of it and i wrote a whole column
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:49.000]  about it was the shiller memo about the 30 cut and and saying do we expect 30 just saying
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.200]  he was just like uh paraphrasing but like here just a spitball i'm just saying do we
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.860]  expect 30 to last forever and if not what do we do why don't we why don't we get this
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:05.260]  to where we're profiting at a billion dollar run rate and keep it at a billion a year and
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:10.160]  just keep you know go to 25 and then because it's acknowledging what we're talking about
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.200]  it's so it's not like these are the commandments handed you know down from above these are
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.600]  all you know things that are just pulled out of thin air that they just you know put their
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:21.480]  finger in the wind and decided one day that this was the cut and the billion dollar thing
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.080]  that's like just drawing a line that's that's an easy marker it's like all of these things
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.600]  are just man-made by people at apple like what what on earth are they holding them so
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.900]  dearly for i really don't get it and i know i've said this before but i'll keep repeating
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:39.480]  it because it's it's my one of my core thoughts about the whole thing that i don't get is
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.920]  i i'm not familiar and to to i've been saying this for months and and nobody's pointed to
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:52.720]  a good counterexample to disprove it i am not aware of any company major corporation
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.620]  i mean to be an antitrust trouble trouble you have to be a major company right like
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:14:01.800]  nobody is going to accuse daring fireball of having uh a monopoly on john grouper's
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.320]  opinions right that's that's not a thing right you know it although it is somewhat the same
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:14.480]  logic of the iphone having monopoly on iphone apps yeah but it's it's you know it it you
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.200]  have to be a major company i'm not aware of any major company getting an antitrust trouble
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:26.360]  over a side business ever it's always the core business at and t got broken up for long
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:30.120]  distance phone calls that's that was their core business people didn't even realize you
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.160]  know like you could be a nerd and realize at and t bell labs invented unix and the c
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.000]  programming language and actually did laid the foundation for the internet and did this
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.760]  amazing computer science work and and all sorts of other research everybody thought
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.740]  at and t was the phone company and they got broken up over their policies on long distance
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.840]  phone calls that was it microsoft when the microsoft got an antitrust trouble in the
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:55.760]  90s it was over windows and office that's what microsoft was right what what else did
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.440]  they the only one example i can think of which you'll find humorous uh and you'll remember
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.500]  well and but it's not exactly right but it's sort of at least directionally right when
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:10.520]  apple lost that that lawsuit to amazon about books remember yeah right right right which
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.800]  was uh the ebook price price fixing case which was so curious because the monopolist clearly
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:21.920]  i mean by any definition of monopoly amazon already had a monopoly on ebooks with the
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.960]  kindle uh it was very strange and and ben thompson and i argue this all the time because
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.480]  he always says well they were price fixing and it is illegal and you can't collaborate
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:34.200]  with the with the book publishers but yeah that is sure but that was one where it's like
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.840]  a side but that was obviously was not apple's corpus and it still is not apple's sort of
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.820]  surprise is still in that business but yes like that's one where it's not a core yeah
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:46.480]  right well and the the other thing about the ebook thing was it wasn't just a side business
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.040]  it the whole even the lawsuit was like not really important to them right apple could
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.920]  have just said well then we you know let's just get rid of this yeah yeah screw this
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.360]  well we won't sell ebooks fine screw you you're on your own and it wouldn't have mattered
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.660]  whereas saying screw you we're getting out of the app store business isn't going to happen
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:07.900]  right it is important you know what i mean it it's a side business but it's a notable
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.760]  important side business and it you know and services has been there right and their message
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.840]  right potentially yeah the the future of growth for the stock at the very least um right you
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:25.320]  know is is tied into that yeah but like you know apple generally like clockwork it's freakishly
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.880]  so given the way the the especially the way the world has gone over the last few years
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.280]  you know with covid and anything else you can imagine and and just the way that that
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:42.080]  hardware components prices go up they go down and there are trends and there are iphones
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.520]  that seemingly sell better than apple expected and then there's other years where they sold
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.960]  fewer than expected and the reports are that they're cutting orders blah blah blah yet
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.720]  meanwhile quarter after quarter after quarter they run company right wide profit margins
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:05.480]  of 38 or 39 percent right just it's like clockwork so i understand why apple doesn't like tim
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:13.000]  cook doesn't decide we're making enough money let's go company-wide to 34 profit margins
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:20.280]  and in a few years we'll go to 30 profit margin company-wide i understand that 38 39 profit
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:25.880]  margins is is very generous it's good in the businesses that they're in and it's it's very
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.840]  healthy for apple to be profitable and it suits like you said before their decade-long
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.680]  institutional mentality of we once almost went we we almost went out of business because
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.680]  we ran out of money right and it's like grandparents who went grew up in the depression you know
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.960]  it's i you know you're going to save those pennies yep oh my god they would my my my
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:53.440]  my dad's aunt aunt kitty my great aunt kitty reused cellophane she reused pieces of cellophane
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.460]  to wrap stuff she was well off she was a successful she worked at a jewelry store and had a successful
[01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:04.800]  career and was very well off later in life she reused cellophane you know you don't forget
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:14.160]  stuff like that i i don't understand it because they could they can go to 25 or could have
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:22.240]  gone up years ago to 25 be at 20 by now and it yes they would be making less money i guess
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.800]  in some ways though it's like the arguments about tax rates that you can to some degree
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:32.560]  i'm not saying that the the the laugher curve is actually legit but there is some argument
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.720]  that it's like the basics of calculus right like you can't increase taxes to 100 to increase
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.260]  government revenue because if you literally increased income tax to 100 literally people
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:48.840]  would would not work and i know that there are arguments that oh you know you can't increase
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.240]  taxes because you know the earners are going to lose interest in working there there's
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:58.620]  but there's it's a calculus right and you can't decrease them to zero to get workers
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.740]  the most enthused because they're keeping the most money because then literally the
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:08.360]  government makes no money so the optimal tax rate for encouraging people to work hard and
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.160]  making them happy and feel like they're keeping their fair share but also keeping the government
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.520]  afloat is somewhere between zero and 100 and you can argue about it and where it should
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:26.000]  be and it's the optimal rate for the app store is some number between zero and 100 but it's
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:32.660]  not 30 as it's grown right it's just it it is it's too much and it and the other interesting
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:38.000]  point that uh that brings sort of tangential to what you're talking about but it's that
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.540]  the reason why you would do it now is because so if you believe that the app store and services
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:47.440]  revenue are going to continue to increase at a greater rate than the iphone revenue
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.760]  will and become a bigger part of the business obviously services and software have a much
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:58.500]  higher margin and so you could actually do it now in a way that maintains their overall
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:04.040]  margin because you're basically uh you can cut it on the software side a bit and it's
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.800]  still so much higher than it is on the hardware side where you can maintain that but if you
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.800]  wait to do it until i don't know five years down the road where services are a much bigger
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.360]  thing you know the wall street's going to look at that and being like why are the margins
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:20.000]  dropping all of a sudden like oh because you had to cut the the app store revenue from
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.980]  30 to 15 or whatever and that had a huge impact on the business and then it would have a huge
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:29.360]  impact on the stock like does anyone think that 30 is always going to hold up forever
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.960]  i don't think anyone does like it's just a matter of time and the way in which it gets
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.580]  degraded and like we were talking about earlier my my guess is that they they do things like
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.480]  exactly what they did with the news publishers and that they've done with amazon and others
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:46.180]  who put their their uh their services on the apple tv for example they basically say if
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:51.040]  you're willing to put your content here we will give you we will agree to do a 15 cut
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:55.780]  instead of a 30 cut and i think that they start to do that on a more granular level
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:21:00.560]  with all with all sorts of different type of developers like if you agree to this type
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:05.120]  of thing within the app store to be featured in this area like we will we will allow you
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:09.480]  to do the 15 cut i think that's how they're going to back into it but i don't think that
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.840]  they're always going to stay with 30 it's just not tenable i do think that i have heard
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:20.360]  that this is my best argument other than pure greed is and like a mentality that they just
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.120]  want every dollar they can and they really feel entitled to it and really feel like going
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.280]  to 25 percent would be losing they'd be losing five percent just be stole five percent of
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:35.240]  every sale through the app store is being stolen from apple is is the idea that it is
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:39.720]  that hardware margins have been trending down and to keep the company's margins where they
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:46.520]  are they need services to to grow and and that is a large story you know as the basic
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.400]  gist of why they're trying to cling to this when it seems obvious to everybody outside
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:58.480]  those who really are against the company and don't like them and even people like me who
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:06.040]  are largely in favor of the company and fans of the company and want them to do well see
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.260]  as untenable and it it's very strange but the shiller memo that came out was exactly
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:17.200]  what i thought and and and he even said we should think about doing this sooner rather
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:23.080]  than later totally from a position of strength and i feel like apple is still in a position
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:30.360]  of strength and this settlement was an opportunity right to do it i totally agree that's actually
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.080]  why it's more frustrating like when you read that it's like you know beyond the the the
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.840]  hoodwinking and everything uh it's it's in fact that this was the perfect opportunity
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.000]  to do something magnanimous not to pretend like you're doing something magnanimous to
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.400]  actually do it and and have all the all the cover in the world from you know this lawsuit
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.440]  and everything else going on it's like okay look like and and that's in the piece that
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.720]  i wrote like you know i wrote what i wish sort of apple would have would have said in
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.540]  a press release obviously a much sort of succinct and shorter version of it um but it's basically
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.680]  along those lines it's like look we're we understand the situation that's currently
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:10.920]  going on we think it's it's now you know in in everyone's best interest both in apples
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.960]  in the developer community and in our customers best interest to make some changes right now
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.760]  and here's what we're going to do it's sort of like how i envision almost like steve jobs
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:23.160]  types you know saying it uh because he's done those types of very blunt very straightforward
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.920]  memos obviously he had his own agenda and he was he was his master manipulator of things
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:33.300]  but he was very good at sort of doing taking stock of the situation and uh and and coming
[01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.480]  down in a way that was very you know at least on the surface straightforward and and plain
[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:43.500]  speaking right right right it's yeah it and it's a good point and again i'm i'm like you
[01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:50.160]  i i i i really really like to hold my play this i like to hold my steve jobs cards very
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.700]  close and use them very seldomly but for sure you can't help but feel that it would have
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:24:00.000]  been let's how do we cut this off how do we make this go away how do you know that was
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.680]  like the whole thing with thoughts on flash how do we just make this whole stupid debate
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:08.740]  about getting flash on iphones go away let's just make it go away and drm remember that
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:13.120]  yeah same yeah yeah music thoughts on music right and here you know what we're gonna do
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.840]  we're gonna just get rid of the drm we're gonna get rid of it okay here you go it's
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:24.160]  gone we're gonna just put mp3s uh or un unencrypted uh aa3 files on that itunes store there you

[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.080]  frustrating i don't know uh details of the settlement it there's it's really nothing
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.200]  it's like you said i mean i don't even think it's worth going apart your blog post sort
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:42.280]  of goes in i'm gonna put ryan jones uh a guy a developer of the great uh yeah weather flighty
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:48.560]  weatherline which is now recently sold yeah right weatherline which is great uh he had
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.680]  a great summary of it going through it line by line and sort of uh deconstructing how
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:59.680]  it was a nothing burger which is just a great uh great phrase for it the email thing is
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:04.240]  sort of is sort of a slight clarification but basically you don't really get to you
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:11.200]  know you have it it's like if you have the customer's email and they uh and they opted
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:17.240]  in to receive marketing message from you explicitly then you can email them and tell them things
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:22.480]  like hey you can come to our website and buy our stuff at a different price and you don't
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:27.240]  have to go through apple but you can't do it through the app um and i said i wanted
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.760]  to come back to this like what can you do in the app none of that has changed what i
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.720]  would like to see happen for sure and i cannot believe apple hasn't agreed to this i really
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.840]  can't is i just want them to get rid of the rule that prevents developers from telling
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.600]  you in the app it's so stupid it's so stupid and no one thinks that it's i mean there's
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.560]  nothing you could say with a straight face it's literally stifling speech in a way right
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:28:00.120]  like what what on earth you can't say in your app where to go that's ridiculous it it it
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.680]  including netflix like you download the netflix app and it doesn't tell you what to do if
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.380]  you don't have a netflix account you know and yes there are people who still don't have
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:12.760]  netflix accounts and maybe they finally heard about a show they want to watch and they download
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:17.480]  the netflix app and they don't have an account all there is it says sign in and but i don't
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:21.440]  have a sign in beyond the legality of it and whatever like you know being able to say or
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.000]  not say something is just ridiculous from apple's perspective because it's an awful
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.320]  consumer experience if someone loads up an app and they don't know what to do with it
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:34.480]  and they won't let you as a developer tell them where to go that is the shitty consumer
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.800]  experience and apple is allowing that that app still in the app store and yet you like
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:45.120]  it's just a dead end it's so stupid there was an app a couple months ago over the mid-summer
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:48.480]  i forget the name of the app i don't have it off the top of my head but it was it was
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:55.320]  sort of like only fans but not definitely not uh porn porn porn and again that's a whole
[01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:59.220]  other issue with only fans and i don't want to get into but it was like a place where
[01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:02.920]  you could follow your favorite influencers who could sign up through the thing and then
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.240]  you could pay them five dollars a month or whatever and get special messages or have
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:12.880]  direct messages with them and they were taking all the money on their website i do i think
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.320]  they made a mistake by having the web view in their app for a while where you could actually
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.380]  be in the app and it would open a web view to do the payment and i think that by the
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:25.520]  rules they they definitely had to take that out but then they they took it so far and
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.220]  i got curious about the app i remember downloading it and just to try it out kick the tires and
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:35.360]  tried to follow somebody and i couldn't even follow i was like this app is like really
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:40.640]  poorly made i don't even know how to follow somebody and if it turned out and i went to
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.960]  the help and if help didn't explain it and then i went to their website and went to the
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.900]  help on the website and the help on the website said you can only follow people on the website
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:52.200]  and then they'll show up in the app and it was it wasn't that wasn't strategic on their
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:57.080]  part it was like they were in a panic because of the the hey you need to change this or
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:01.440]  you're out of the app store in a month email they got from the app store and in a panic
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.520]  they just sort of took everything down that they could from the app it but it's it it's
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.860]  a terrible experience it is a terrible objectively a terrible experience that you download the
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:18.200]  netflix app to your phone or your ipad or your apple tv and it your only option is to
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:24.800]  sign in and you need to if if you need to sign up it literally not only doesn't let
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:30.320]  you sign up it doesn't tell you how to sign up and all i'm saying as a minimum is let
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:35.840]  apps tell you how to sign up even if they're not allowed to let you sign up in the app
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.880]  even if that's going to be the rule that you can't allow people to sign up if they're going
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:47.680]  to pay with an external thing uh you know external credit card just say go to netflix.com
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.760]  if you don't have an account go to netflix.com and sign up there if you don't have a hey
[01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:59.640]  account go to hey.com and you can sign up there that just let people say that that's
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.200]  obviously obviously they should do that and it's ridiculous that they don't and they're
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.760]  i mean that and that's such an argument against them too right because it is such an easy
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.360]  argument like it's ridiculous to everyone it's ridiculous to end users to developers
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:17.440]  and apple's the only one who who views it as not ridiculous for their you know stated
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:22.200]  reasons of uh you know we can go into like security and and all of this other stuff that
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.360]  they'll they'll use it as an excuse and in some cases it's true in this case it's just
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.360]  an excuse um but i took a hard line earlier you know when we were talking of saying like
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.360]  you should be able to put in any payment processor you want and let apple win by having the best
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:40.240]  product and i do believe that but i do think there's also a more granular level that they'll
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:45.880]  probably try or should at least try uh before that which is just just say again like you're
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:50.800]  saying say where you can go to actually sign up for an account and ideally you know have
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:56.560]  it have a url like uh you know god forbid have a url and don't you know maybe if you
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:01.800]  don't let them pay right through the app itself using all the the sort of uh the regular apis
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.040]  you just open up a web view and let them do it that way and that alone is is a degraded
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:10.000]  experience because you have to open up new views and you have to load things like that
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.660]  alone should be enough for apple to sort of win you know with a with a playing field stack
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:19.920]  to their advantage and yet they won't even do that here here's where i'm uh what what
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.760]  i see and i feel like people espousing your viewpoint aren't acknowledging is that there
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:29.480]  is a win for normal users people the sort of people who are confused as to whether they're
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:36.360]  in the app or on a website right now um there there is a huge win to the idea that if you
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:42.840]  pay sign up for something and make an in-app purchase in the app you are always and only
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:49.160]  going through apple and apple has your back on and again you start saying safety and people
[01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:56.000]  start thinking 1999 1997 online safety where there was a is it safe to type your credit
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.120]  card into a a web page i don't know it doesn't seem safe to me it says somebody eating lunch
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:07.640]  with a friend handing their card to the waiter to pay the bill right right but that was that
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.880]  was the thing it seemed weird and terrifying to just type your credit card number into
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.020]  a form on this thing that you don't really understand and it goes off and it comes back
[01:33:16.020 --> 01:33:20.180]  and it says you bought it not that type of safety that your credit card is going to get
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:24.920]  jacked just by typing it in if stripe were allowed but the type of safety i'm talking
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:29.800]  about is and i always go to the new york times because the new york times is credible organization
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:36.120]  many people argue the the best newspaper in the world um canceling a new york time subscription
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:41.320]  that you make with the new york times requires you to call a 800 number and talk to somebody
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:48.260]  whose full-time job is talking people out of canceling their new york time subscriptions
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.820]  and that is bullshit and that that that's the new york times like imagine how bad subscriptions
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:57.880]  could be and that is a great point though but that's a great point that points to what
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.200]  i think apple should do to reconcile those two things of what you're talking about apple
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.560]  already reviews all these apps they do that famously they've hired all these people they
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.780]  have the infrastructure now to do it and they seem to do it you know there's obviously mistakes
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:12.960]  and all the stuff that we read about but it's overall a pretty effective system why don't
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:19.360]  they just turn that vision also to then these types of things so you say like okay so if
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:23.560]  you sign up through the new york times and you don't sign up with apple you sign up through
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:29.220]  new york times itself look the re the way you guys uh handle unsubscribe like that's
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.880]  just not going to fly with our user base you got to make it more simplified if you want
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.760]  this to be approved in there with that and apple could use their power for good in that
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:43.560]  regard right and make it so that if you do if you use stripe in your app and they sign
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:48.920]  up take signups in the app you have to you have to comply with an api that still puts
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:56.200]  your app in the the list for your your subscriptions right you go and it's one click unsubscribe
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.900]  yes just make them adhere to these standard principles of how right ios runs yes right
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:12.000]  in in and and even if they had like a set of trusted payment providers stripe paypal
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.680]  you know right the list could go on even yeah yeah right right cash amazon is the list could
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.680]  be you know quite long but they you know it could be you have to use a trusted provider
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.960]  and then when you go to your list of subscriptions any and all subscriptions you've made through
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:32.080]  an app that you got from the app store all of those would let be listed and they could
[01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:39.480]  even say subscribed through uh apple subscribe through apple subscribe through stripe subscribe
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:45.280]  through paypal something like that but it's again one tap then a confirm and you're unsubscribed
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.400]  no questions asked and if you have any funny business with that your app they'll they should
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.360]  pull your app out of the app store which gets to the whole other side topic of scams and
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:58.980]  confusion and things that apple should be policing that i think they are policing but
[01:35:58.980 --> 01:36:03.260]  that they're not policing enough you know like they have really some numbers on how
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:07.720]  many scam developers they kick out every year and it is a shockingly high number which is
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:12.480]  interesting because of all the scams that do get through and my analogy would be my
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:18.080]  analogy would be to like times square new york 1976 and the police are like we we're
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:24.120]  arresting 500 people a night and yet other people are like yeah but there's still muggers
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:29.280]  out in the street right like both things are true like the police are arresting a bunch
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.080]  of criminals and there's still a lot of crime and it could be i think it is the truth that
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.800]  apple is catching a lot of scammers and yet there's still too many scams and so you know
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.400]  and i don't think it's excusable i think there's too much if they have too much money and it's
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.160]  it's too possible that they could catch them i think they could make that work but if anything
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:55.740]  where they they expand the list of payment providers outside um it should be along those
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:37:02.220]  lines and that's the problem the read the room problem that apple has is the the cynical
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:08.440]  take is nope apple is just in it for the money they don't care about the user experience
[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:16.360]  they're not doing this to protect people like my parents who trust a purchase they make
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.980]  on their phone in an app or in the app store if my mom buys like a new word game and she
[01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:24.520]  just feels like i you know i've been doing this for she's been doing this for 10 years
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:29.380]  now on her ipad she feels like she's not going to get ripped off by buying a four dollar
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:37.040]  word game or something like that that sort of thing could could stay but it and it is
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:40.620]  important but the the cynical take i mean amy klobuchar has led the way on it she's
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:45.260]  like i don't believe it they're in it for the money right and and it's hard i don't
[01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:48.420]  think that's true i think both are true i think apple is in it for the money and that's
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:53.000]  why they're clinging to the 30 but i think apple is very very serious about the trusted
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.080]  aspect of if you make a purchase in an app we've got your back that it's not a scam
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.080]  i totally agree with that i just like again you just have to zoom out and know that ultimately
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.160]  it's going to change it's not tenable we're already talking about look at what's going
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.660]  on and i think it's south korea right where they're basically i have that on the list
[01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:15.680]  yeah they're going to force them to let you install third-party app store it's just going
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.360]  to happen by the you know the if you want to operate in that country yeah i thought
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.240]  that the i thought the korean legislation was about payment processing not app stores
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.000]  oh is it sorry i i could be confused i'll i'll put it but either way but whichever
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.760]  way it is it's the same argument right it's basically there's going to be at some point
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.480]  down the road uh some sort of legislation in some country even if it's not the us that
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:45.520]  forces these types of changes that they don't want to make at a fundamental level and you
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.440]  know do they want to go down that path on their own terms or do they want to have those
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:57.120]  those paths dictated to them and well uh yeah i i would say mandating legally third-party
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.760]  app stores is a step further and more disruptive i i i think it's a terrible idea and like
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.080]  i've described it i it seems to me like the clobichar blooming thought legislation boils
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.120]  down to apple apple and andrew apple and google should be forced to run their mobile platforms
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.480]  like mac and windows pc platforms in terms of being able to install any and all software
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.920]  you want if you click a button or two and and i know i say that and then some people
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.260]  out there like yes exactly that is what you know i've been wanted for my iphone ever since
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:33.040]  it came out is i want it to be just like my mac i i want that i think it's a disaster
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:39.040]  will be i i don't i wouldn't i'm not saying guaranteed i but i i think ultimately it would
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:44.900]  be and i think that most people out there agree people general iphone users aren't unhappy
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:48.320]  about the fact that they get all their apps from the app store most of them i think have
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.520]  no strong opinion about it i think they like the clarity of finding it there and i think
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:56.800]  there's a lot of them who thrive on it because they feel like they know that nothing they
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:02.000]  install on their phone is going to mess up their phone and that is actually true i totally
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.280]  and i'm with you there and and by the way you're right uh sorry i i misspoke it is all
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:09.840]  about the payment uh third-party payment methods within the thing which is exactly what we're
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.120]  talking about and so that makes a ton of sense and and it seems like that they delayed it
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.960]  or whatever it looks like the other day but it is it is likely it seems like to pass right
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:22.720]  and so what apple does it will be fascinating uh do they pull out of korea or do they say
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.280]  that this is sandboxed away and this is just different that's probably right what they're
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.880]  going to do they're going to say like we will operate differently in korea than we operate
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.160]  everywhere else but it opens up at least in people's minds you know like look apple can
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.960]  do this because they are doing it somewhere else right there was a i think it was montana
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:45.440]  had some proposed state legislature that's right yeah yeah to do this to to mandate i
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:50.720]  don't forget if it was payments or app stores or whatever but i remember thinking hmm state
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.000]  by state probably isn't the way and montana certainly isn't the state and and it it wound
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.780]  up it was a proposal and and people testified and it got a little bit of press and it never
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.920]  even went to a vote on the state senate floor or whatever it you know fizzled out but if
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:11.160]  it had passed uh montana is a market apple could say well we're sorry but your legislature
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:15.760]  passed a law we're not you know that makes the iphone unsafe so you know we're out and
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.720]  i feel yeah yeah and i think apple might be you know as a as a political strategy probably
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.160]  on the right side that iphone every iphone user calling up their state senator to say
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:32.440]  what the hell did you just do now my iphone can't get apps is would get the law repealed
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:38.720]  right it's like now if california passed a law like that hmm right i don't know but but
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:44.240]  anyway if if if mandating third having laws passed around the world that that that tries
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.360]  to get them to say you have to have third-party app stores and sideloading and or sideloading
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:56.600]  whatever you want to say is worse and displeasureable and would truly disrupt the iphone uh uh platform
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:04.200]  as we know it bending on the payment stuff the 30 fee for apple the the when and where
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:11.240]  can you just take credit card numbers on your own in the app would alleviate that pressure
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:15.860]  because the whole thing about the app store thing is all about them you're just in it
[01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:19.440]  for the money you're just in it for the money and if you could say no we're not just in
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.960]  it for the money look here we'll cut it to 20 we love our developers and you know there's
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:28.840]  some way that they could spin it you know and make it seem like you know less of a well
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.880]  you really you know we're beaten and bloodied and we're we're really up up against the wall
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:36.480]  so we're here we'll give in they could make it seem like it's win-win somehow like we
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:41.040]  just love our developers so much and we realize you know we've been listening we hear you
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.920]  and so we're cutting it to 20 because we want you to do well and we love you you know again
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:50.280]  i guess that they view that as a slippery slope like how you know if it's 20 then when
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.040]  does it go to 15 and when does it go to 10 and when does it go to five and and so on
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:43:02.440]  and so forth and um so i don't know 20 10 15 5 i don't know but you know and and why
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:08.160]  not just go 20 10 just just it's take take everything that's at 30 go to 20 take everything
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:14.040]  that's a 15 go to 10 and and just say this is this and this covers you know this this
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:18.640]  is much closer to you know this is great for developers covers the cost and yeah all that
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.120]  right right um anyway i got it i got to interrupt i have to interrupt i have one more sponsor
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:29.860]  i gotta fit it in go and oh it's a new sponsor and boy do i like this company made in how

[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.640]  just one last thing I remember what I was conflating now so the South Korea thing is
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:00.760]  absolutely about the payments what we were talking about earlier the Richard Blumenthal
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:05.260]  and Amy Klobuchar bill is actually the Open App Markets Act that's the thing that's trying
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:10.400]  to get them to do the sideloading of third-party apps right or third-party app stores yep right
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.880]  and and again if they want to make that go away giving in on the payments is the way
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:24.600]  to do it and and I it it's a it is it's a conflict of interest to say that we're both
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:30.120]  trying to are that Apple's argument is that their their utmost concern is the user experience
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:35.040]  and trustworthiness of the platform and that you know when you download an app it at a
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.720]  technical level isn't going to do anything bad it's not going to install system agents
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:44.400]  that run invisibly in the background and that when you delete the app they're still there
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:48.560]  running in the background you can't just under everything gets when you uninstall an app
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:56.840]  everything gets deleted which is fantastic it is great when when you purchase stuff you
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:06.360]  know it's not a scam that's great it but it's a conflict of interest to to be making billions
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:14.000]  of dollars and growing and enforce these truly some of the terms like the anti-steering stuff
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.240]  where you can't even tell them without even a tappable link to go to our website to sign
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:24.200]  up there's no argument for that in terms of making the platform better or it's worse it's
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.420]  confusing and it it can only be explained by being about the money so it's a conflict
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:33.720]  of interest and if they just make that do whatever they can to make that conflict of
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:39.200]  interest lessened you know it's not going to go away unless they actually said we're
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:42.200]  not going to collect we're not going to take any money which they're not going to do and
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.280]  which they shouldn't have to do one i would like your thoughts on the one last thing which
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:50.560]  you brought up sort of earlier which was german's uh thing today about the succession planning
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.640]  at apple because i thought that that was interesting who the four people that he named and i pulled
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:58.320]  it up so i could so i could just rattle them off or maybe it was four or five but he basically
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.900]  goes over all the key executives right now and gives a sort of a yay or nay if he thinks
[01:47:02.900 --> 01:47:08.800]  it's feasible um that they could be potentially that you know the next in line given all the
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:13.120]  stock option stuff with cook just given how long he's obviously just passed the 10-year
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.380]  mark running the company and he's you know getting a little bit up there in age right
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:23.720]  not 60 he's 60 61 years old so he's pretty young but um still it seems it seems likely
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.320]  you know that some points certainly in the next decade that he's going to to take a step
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.900]  back and you know it could be as soon as 2025 as they're reporting via the stock options
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:39.060]  and and sort of the handcuffs that he has in place right now and so the key list that
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:44.100]  he goes over is basically jeff williams which everyone knows is sort of top of mind right
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.760]  now because he is basically in the same position that cook was in when he got elevated right
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:55.980]  so he right he's he's uh he's a coo now um and he was also running uh a lot of the logistics
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:59.980]  which cook previously ran and so you know that's a very obvious choice the weird thing
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:04.580]  there is that he is very close in age to cook and i also think that there is something to
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:09.860]  be said and this is sort of an interesting debate to be had about is he enough of a showman
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:14.180]  to sort of be the person who's on stage and then we should argue like is that necessary
[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:17.700]  right because cook and some cook is obviously not steve jobs but he's done a good job sort
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:24.220]  of coming into his own skin right as the as the sort of person who mcs these events um
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:28.780]  but if you're looking just at the mc level it would obviously be craig fader right who
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:34.540]  would be the person who is like the the most sort of charismatic uh mc type person who
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:38.540]  would be the one to run that right german doesn't think that he's actually sort of uh
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:42.960]  one of the ones that would be necessarily in the top sort of five in line to to run
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.020]  it and i thought that that was interesting because i would have assumed that he was sort
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:52.100]  of one of those people i i feel like this is such a black box in such a mystery like
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:49:00.500]  did did tim cook get the job because that's what apple institutionally saw as the natural
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:06.780]  way to go to go from the operations person to ceo you know the next in line and jeff
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:12.380]  williams has absolutely taken on what was tim cook's role as coo occasionally on stage
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:19.540]  to sort of prep him for it um he is lower key and i think that the i think the bigger
[01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:26.820]  problem is the age thing right like i compare it to when they they recast uh james bond
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:33.100]  with roger moore because roger roger moore is actually was actually they're both dead
[01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:36.700]  now unfortunately but he's he was actually a couple of years older than sean connery
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:43.080]  right right right and so his entire run as james bond which was seven films was as an
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.940]  older middle-aged james bond even at the beginning he was sort of leather-faced um he didn't
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:53.540]  have to wear a wig though to his to uh no that is true but when connery did it was always
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:57.540]  it was a nice yeah he's had a very nice so i don't know you gotta jeff williams is on
[01:49:57.540 --> 01:50:01.180]  the list and and you know obviously if tim cook leaves sooner rather than later it would
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:06.860]  i think it would definitely be williams um i think i don't think tim cook is i i think
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:13.620]  the 2025 thing is is is an un-apple-like and un-tim cook-like way of acting about it yes
[01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:18.000]  just doing something because of the stock options or whatever you mean there's yeah
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.720]  there's i think he'd be more likely to if he's thinking about retiring i swear to god
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:27.540]  i mean this i think tim cook would be more likely to retire before they all vest and
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:32.340]  leave walk away from them it's a better than i agree i agree with that yeah and and by
[01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:37.780]  all accounts he lives he lives very humbly he's like a uh warren buffett and and doesn't
[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:41.360]  he's a billionaire mansion yeah yeah he's already he doesn't need it and and it would
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:46.780]  be a better look it would the the least likely thing possible would be for tim cook to let
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:52.200]  those let all that vest in 2025 and then quit then walk away yeah then the very apple-like
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.860]  thing to do would be actually to do it around a product cadence right to say like look we
[01:50:55.860 --> 01:51:01.440]  just shipped this this ar glasses and that was i drew a line in the sand and said that
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.380]  is the thing that i'm going to get out the door yeah yeah and then that's german german
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:08.600]  even said that that's actually being talked about within apple he doesn't say by whom
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:13.460]  but you know he's obviously got sources that that cook is thinking one more major product
[01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:17.580]  which you know the next thing is going to be glasses if if and when they ever do do
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:26.060]  a car that's uh clearly further out yeah um uh i don't know i i did it fetteri you know
[01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:31.500]  i think it's up to fetteri maybe i don't know i mean he mentions jaws too um yeah he mentions
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.600]  jaws which is sort of a wild card because he was just elevated right to right bp level
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:39.420]  he wasn't he's been at the company obviously forever but he is an interesting choice the
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:43.420]  the didra o'brien one i think is maybe the most interesting one of the ones that he mentioned
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:49.400]  uh right because she has done so many different roles but she's also relatively new to being
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:54.980]  elevated to this level after um angela arent's left and and right yeah and so now she has
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:52:00.860]  this bifurcated role and i you know before she left i know a lot of people would email
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:05.340]  me it was like a super common email like people speculating about the ceo succession thing
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:10.500]  who thought angela aren't's was a lock for it and i was like no no way because yeah no
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:16.460]  way that's pretty she's not she yeah she hasn't been there long enough and retail is not the
[01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:20.840]  direction that would that it would come from i mean like i think she was fine running retail
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:24.980]  and she has a terrific presence on stage but i don't i don't think that was i guess the
[01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:29.460]  idea there though was that she had been ceo of berberi right and so like the idea that
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:33.040]  she was a ceo before and she was the only one maybe with that experience could lead
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:38.940]  to that but yeah totally different world yeah right right that's not how apple thinks the
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:43.700]  john tournes one is really interesting um because he has been definitely getting elevated more
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:46.980]  in these events especially the virtual ones that we've been having and it does seem like
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:51.780]  he is stepping into something and he is very young uh relative to the to the other folks
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:56.460]  um so i do think that that's an interesting one that i hadn't really considered before
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:53:02.860]  i yeah yeah i mean he's definitely a comer right he's he is he is up and coming and he's
[01:53:02.860 --> 01:53:08.140]  you know by by all the people mentioned the youngest but there's also like with uh with
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:13.260]  federighi and tournes in particular there's like maybe a self-awareness of the pareto
[01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:17.980]  principle right which is that the idea that people tend to get promoted until the point
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:22.380]  where they're no longer good at their job right you're great at your job here's a promotion
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:26.520]  oh you did great with your promotion here's a promotion and when does that stop when you
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:31.280]  get promoted to a position you're not good at it's a fascinating idea and it kind of
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.780]  makes very intuitive sense there's an there's a notion there that federighi is no it's maybe
[01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:43.300]  self-aware that leading software engineering at apple is is the peak of what he's good
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:49.420]  at and for tournes he tournes is truly i mean i've had uh you know private briefings with
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:54.860]  him he's brilliant he's and he really is he knows he's not like some kind of oh uh pretty
[01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:58.800]  pretty face on the hardware or whatever he knows his shit i mean he knows the hardware
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:05.120]  stuff down he is he knows everything about apple hardware um is that good for the ceo
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:11.620]  right i right it's a very good question it points to i mean the answer ultimately probably
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:15.260]  comes down to because we're in it's a totally different position than we were a decade ago
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:19.020]  when when cook took over and everyone knew of jobs as health issues and it was a very
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:23.900]  unfortunate situation and in a way you know cook ended up being the perfect choice obviously
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:27.700]  it was a bit controversial just because he wasn't a product you know guy like like jobs
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:31.020]  was but it ended up being the perfect choice for apple for the next 10 years and that's
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:34.740]  proven itself in many ways right uh certainly is the most valuable company in the world
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:39.300]  and the stock and everything else um what does the next 10 years you know so say it's
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:44.760]  like 2024 so it's before he vests all those shares and and they have the the ar product
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:51.700]  out there um and it's 2024 let's say and so what's what is 2024 to 2034 look like for
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:55.680]  apple and that's like sort of you know trying to figure out what that is and what those
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:00.180]  product lines are and what the what the mix of the company is sort of is probably what
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:06.380]  the answer ends up being i don't know what that is though right now right yeah i i say
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.740]  i i think the best clue looking forward is to keep track of stage time you know and and
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:15.020]  by all accounts when steve jobs like when steve jobs went on medical leaves it was always
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:19.500]  uh tim cook as interim ceo right right so that was an obvious right tipping of right
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:23.740]  and and when he when he stepped down he said i'm recommending to the board that they that
[01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:30.260]  they promote steve tim cook it seems like and that was the succession plan um i think
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:35.900]  it's a real mystery what it is now um but i would even bring up you bring up one great
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.060]  point just directly off of that because at a board level you know i've been lucky enough
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:44.220]  to be on boards at this point and not at a public company though but i would say that
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:48.260]  there are always discussions about succession planning right and that was famously you know
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:53.900]  a level of uh uh divisiveness within the apple board because of jobs right but at at some
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:58.840]  point he recognized that you know needed to happen um this is a fiduciary responsibility
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.260]  to do that for the company as a public company and so they're obviously having those discussions
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:07.580]  not because sick thank god but like because right you know it's it's a natural thing that
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:11.660]  you have to do and so they're having these discussions and it's a matter of how far along
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:16.780]  are they um and it would seem like probably not that far along if nothing is sort of leaking
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.540]  out as an obvious one except for the jeff williams thing absolutely what you're saying
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.140]  and what german says is has to be true that if something were to happen on you know out
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:28.660]  of the blue tomorrow and cook had to step down for some reason it would definitely be
[01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:33.940]  jeff williams but it's unlikely to be in five years which is interesting no my gut feeling
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:39.440]  is that tim cook is going to be here closer to 10 years than not and and that the succession
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:44.060]  planning i think would start five years from now and that there's surely a sealed envelope
[01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:48.380]  with an emergency succession plan right now in case tim cook gets hit by a bus yes and
[01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:52.680]  i think it's yeah and i think it says it just says jeff williams that's what i think so
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:58.700]  i think it's a better question for five years down the road um but your stage time point
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:01.780]  points directly to federighi i mean he gets all the stage time in the world because he's
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:06.580]  so good at it right he's such a natural charismatic person but on the other hand phil shiller
[01:57:06.580 --> 01:57:10.540]  seemingly was never mentioned 10 years ago it was always that's a good point yep and
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:16.300]  chiller by far and away has had the most stage time other than steve jobs yep but that's
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:20.300]  different but that's different now so i would i would say that the stage time thing would
[01:57:20.300 --> 01:57:25.540]  be what to keep an eye on over the next few years yeah again yes it's maybe less about
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:29.460]  the actual stage time and more about the trend over time right it's like how much does it
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:34.380]  rise or fall and that's like that's what you're you're watching to see who is who's carrying
[01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:40.340]  favor yeah anyway mg thank you for your time this is a fantastic episode everybody can
