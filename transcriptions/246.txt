[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  How you doing? All right. Yourself? Great. Really? Well, good. I'm all right.
[00:06.560 --> 00:17.040]  It's okay. It's like a Woody Allen line. I know we're not supposed to talk about Woody
[00:17.040 --> 00:23.520]  Allen anymore, but I went back to being honest. Well, you know what? Yeah, exactly. There's
[00:23.520 --> 00:31.840]  so many, you know, I know that Michael Jackson is the celebrity of the moment who, because of this
[00:31.840 --> 00:41.040]  HBO documentary, there's a serious and, you know, correct discussion about, you know, Hey, what do
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.920]  we, you know, we've got his legacy and we're allowed to listen to the music and we still
[00:45.920 --> 00:49.360]  listen to his music. Yeah, exactly. Can you still play Michael Jackson? That's the wrong way to
[00:49.360 --> 00:53.200]  phrase it, I guess. Like, can you personally, I think is like the right way to phrase it. Like,
[00:53.200 --> 00:57.600]  can you personally justify it? You know, I think that's the question we're all having to ask
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.560]  ourselves. Right. I was out with friends over the weekend and we were at an establishment and,
[01:02.560 --> 01:07.840]  you know, um, they were playing Michael Jackson music. I didn't even really notice it because
[01:07.840 --> 01:10.880]  that Michael Jackson music to me is just one of the, you know, you just hear it all the time.
[01:10.880 --> 01:13.920]  I wasn't really thinking about it, but somebody was like, Ooh, kind of awkward. And then, you
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.120]  know, it is, but it's like, do you want, so do you even want to play it? Let's say you want a
[01:17.120 --> 01:21.680]  restaurant, do you play Michael Jackson music? If you know, you just don't want to make people
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.400]  thinking about stuff like that. But on the other hand, it's some of people's favorite music of all
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.240]  time. It's, it's a tough decision, you know, and yeah, it's hard to think with music and movies
[01:32.240 --> 01:37.280]  because, you know, creative works in general, because our, we attach our own memories to those
[01:37.280 --> 01:41.600]  things and our, their own meanings to them and which is good. That's how art should be. You
[01:41.600 --> 01:47.200]  know, we, we sort of attach things that happen in our lives or people or memories or whatever to
[01:47.200 --> 01:52.480]  them. And, you know, they become greater than, than what they were created for. Like the person
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.080]  who sang the song had their purpose and their reason for singing the song, but it may mean
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.240]  something completely different to us. So I think it becomes much harder to like, to then think
[02:00.240 --> 02:06.240]  about how to separate those things. With somebody living, I think it's almost easier because you're
[02:06.240 --> 02:11.760]  able to say, well, I don't want this person who did these horrific things to continue to benefit,
[02:11.760 --> 02:17.040]  you know, from, from this relationship, but I don't know. It's, it's a tough one.
[02:17.040 --> 02:20.960]  Yeah. And then there's, you know, yeah, like let's say someone like Kevin Spacey,
[02:20.960 --> 02:26.960]  you know, who's, who was so, uh, the allegations against him were so significant and compelling
[02:27.680 --> 02:32.320]  that they literally took a movie. What was the name of that movie? I forget. It was a Ridley
[02:32.320 --> 02:38.160]  Scott movie, uh, where he played like John Paul Getty. I mean, it was like,
[02:38.160 --> 02:42.560]  it didn't have a, the name wasn't very evocative of the, of the subject matter. So I can't recall,
[02:43.120 --> 02:49.760]  but the movie was effectively in the can and was only a few weeks out from coming out and they
[02:50.640 --> 02:57.680]  reshot the movie with a new actor, Christopher plumber in the role, which is remarkable.
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.400]  And I remember watching the movie, uh, which is a spoiler. Well, I guess because they took him out
[03:04.400 --> 03:08.720]  of the movie, I didn't have face any sort of moral conundrum over whether to watch the movie. So I,
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.720]  I guess that's not a spoiler, but I watched the movie and it was immersive enough because Ridley
[03:14.720 --> 03:23.440]  Scott is super, super talented. One of my all time favorite directors that I, I, I tried to watch
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.600]  thinking, can I tell that this was reshot without plumber? Like everything, you know, like single
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.320]  shots of plumber as opposed to two shots with him and other characters. And like, Oh, the wig is
[03:34.320 --> 03:39.120]  different. Well, not the way, but just the shots, you know, like how many of them are two shots
[03:39.120 --> 03:46.080]  where you can tell, you know, either he is in the room with the other actors or they've sufficiently
[03:47.120 --> 03:52.240]  done special effects to convince you he's in the room with the other actors and how many of them
[03:52.240 --> 03:58.400]  are, it's a one shot on his character cut to the opposite angle on the other characters. And they
[03:58.400 --> 04:04.640]  just took shots where they were playing against spacey and use, you know, and, and I see what
[04:04.640 --> 04:09.440]  you're saying. If you keep your eye open for that and you just kind of, if you've ever edited,
[04:09.440 --> 04:13.680]  even just edited video, not like serious films, you kind of know what that's like. If you try
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.960]  to just edit a conversation where there's, let's say three shots, there's one with both characters,
[04:18.960 --> 04:28.000]  one on Michael or Matthew and one on John, and then you intercut between those three, uh, um,
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.480]  shots. And I, but I see, I got lost. The movie was good enough that I got lost to keeping track
[04:34.480 --> 04:38.000]  of it, which is, you know, the way it should be. But there were some where I could tell is like,
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.400]  I don't think this was supposed to be so one shot, a shot B shot. I think there should have
[04:42.400 --> 04:45.760]  been more of a master shot, but, but eventually you lose it.
[04:45.760 --> 04:51.760]  Right. Right. Yeah. You, you sense like the tempo of the conversation says, Hey,
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.920]  there should be some sort of, you know, kind of establishing shot related characters, one another,
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.240]  but it's not there. Right. And then what else was spacey with spacey? There was the whole thing
[05:00.240 --> 05:07.200]  where he was the star co-star I should say of house of cards. Uh, and they had one season to
[05:07.200 --> 05:13.840]  go when the scandal broke and you know, he, he was alive at the end of the last season and then
[05:13.840 --> 05:20.080]  they just decided he was dead to do the last season and, um, didn't seem to go very well
[05:20.640 --> 05:25.920]  in terms of popularity, but what to do, you know, they also, you know, they're in a
[05:25.920 --> 05:31.120]  caught between a rock and a hard pace, you know? Yep. I don't know. I tend to,
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.560]  I've mentioned this on the show before. I tend to disassociate the artist from the art. And so like,
[05:36.560 --> 05:42.320]  I have no problem watching Kevin Spacey movies, but I also understand why they're not making new
[05:42.320 --> 05:47.600]  Kevin Spacey movies. You know, I don't have a problem listening to Michael Jackson music, but
[05:48.400 --> 05:53.520]  yeah, I don't think there's any hard fast rule for, for me. I mean, I think a large part of it
[05:53.520 --> 05:58.400]  for me is sort of, you know, I listen to the way people think about it and the way that they're,
[05:58.400 --> 06:03.600]  they talk about it and how it feels to them. And I try to, I try to always work from that angle.
[06:04.240 --> 06:10.320]  And I know it's weird because like the older I get, and I don't think this is purely just age,
[06:10.320 --> 06:16.320]  but it is certainly an experience based thing. But the older I get, the less likely I am to just
[06:16.320 --> 06:21.520]  say things, you know, you know what I mean? Right? Like you get, you just become more cognizant of
[06:22.400 --> 06:28.160]  power is the wrong word. You know, we do have some sort of small power in the, in the platform that
[06:28.160 --> 06:33.280]  we, you know, that we have in terms of media or whatever the case may be. But even just as a
[06:33.280 --> 06:37.680]  person on a person to person basis, you have some sort of power based on like your reputation or,
[06:37.680 --> 06:42.480]  you know, your cache with your friends or audience or whoever it is you're talking to. And I just
[06:42.480 --> 06:48.640]  think that the, as I get older, I realized that when I was younger, I was really full of shit.
[06:49.520 --> 06:53.040]  And, you know, it's just like, you know, we're, we're all, we're all full of it to some degree,
[06:53.040 --> 06:56.960]  because we're figuring it out as we go. You know, sometimes we're saying things about what we
[06:56.960 --> 07:01.360]  believe, and we're figuring out what we believe as we're saying it, you know, it's not like we've
[07:01.360 --> 07:06.560]  spent hours pondering this thing and have like a concise opinion on every matter, right? We're all
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.040]  figuring things out as we go. I just figure I just find out like, as I'm older, the more I like,
[07:11.040 --> 07:16.720]  instead of taking a hard fast, you know, opinion on things, or even making sure that I have all of
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.600]  these opinions ready, I just listen more and talk less about those things, you know, and that I
[07:21.600 --> 07:26.240]  think is one of those topics that I still am doing a lot of that. I just don't know, you know, I
[07:26.240 --> 07:30.000]  don't know, I don't have any sort of hard fast rule, I think there are some things that I still
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.760]  enjoy personally, but that I would never go like, Oh, I still watch this, you should too, you know,
[07:35.760 --> 07:42.480]  I would never do that about to those about those things. Yeah, I kind of, there's a part of me.
[07:47.360 --> 07:53.280]  I don't want to get in trouble. There's a part of me that thinks the whole the best thing going on
[07:53.280 --> 07:59.520]  to me is the cultural change at a very deep level across multiple industries. And it's spreading
[07:59.520 --> 08:07.840]  like wildfire to every industry, which is that when people do bad things to others, that people
[08:07.840 --> 08:14.480]  who had the bad things done to them should be have a venue to speak up, report it, have it dealt with
[08:14.480 --> 08:26.640]  in a fair way. And, you know, almost all of these things have been it the root problem. I don't want
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.400]  to say one's a bigger problem than the other, like the bad behavior is bad behavior and should be
[08:30.400 --> 08:36.560]  punished. But the structural problem is that in all of these industries, there was so much set up
[08:36.560 --> 08:44.000]  to keep people from reporting it. And if they did reported it reported to bury it, and punish them
[08:44.000 --> 08:50.800]  or something like that, right. So to so as to send a message to other people who suffered, you know,
[08:50.800 --> 08:58.640]  you know, similar harassment or abuse or whatever it is, you know, to send the message to keep quiet
[08:58.640 --> 09:04.240]  and like the dam has burst on that and it hasn't finished or maybe the dam has, you know, severely
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.280]  cracked and there's spouts of water coming out and it's inevitable that the rest of it's going
[09:09.280 --> 09:15.920]  to come down. And I think that's a good thing. I feel like sometimes people, you know, the sort of
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.400]  want to shaming you for watching Woody Allen movies is a little bit sanctimonious. And it's
[09:22.400 --> 09:27.360]  the person telling you that trying to inject themselves into the story, whereas they really
[09:27.360 --> 09:34.640]  had no, no part in it. You know, but virtue signaling, right, to some degree. Yeah. Right.
[09:34.640 --> 09:38.800]  Like, if you don't want to watch Woody Allen movies, that's, you know, to me, that's, that's
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.440]  the line that I wouldn't feel comfortable crossing is it's telling other people not to enjoy Woody
[09:43.440 --> 09:48.320]  Allen movies or Michael Jackson music or Kevin Spacey movies or what have you. But certainly
[09:48.320 --> 09:54.080]  as a personal choice, it might be. Yeah, I think that's valid. Yeah. I mean, I, I don't feel that
[09:54.080 --> 10:00.720]  imposing your worldview on other people is ever the right way to go. But I think in certainly in
[10:00.720 --> 10:06.000]  terms of moral or ethical issues, it's in fact, the worst thing you could do. It's actually
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.800]  harmful because it'll, it does not create any sort of lasting, you know, change of lens for that
[10:14.800 --> 10:20.240]  person. So if you're like, Oh, hey, here, let me explain why I don't let me kind of give you my,
[10:20.240 --> 10:25.120]  my POV on this. And let me explain why it's, you know, problematic or why I have a personal issue
[10:25.120 --> 10:31.360]  with it or my personal connection or whatever. And that is far more likely, I think, to end up
[10:31.360 --> 10:37.680]  with a scenario where you have somebody going, you know what, I see my lens is a different color now,
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.160]  or it's shifted in its angle or viewpoint, rather than some sort of some sort of thing where you're
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.720]  shaming somebody, because I think you end up having, it ends up having a lot of negative
[10:46.720 --> 10:53.760]  effect. And while you may cauterize the problem in the near term, it doesn't cure the infection
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.880]  or whatever you want to call it. Yeah, update from, from the control booth, the movie is was
[10:58.880 --> 11:04.720]  called all the money in the world. That was the Ridley Scott film where they erased Kevin Spacey
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.200]  and replaced him with Christopher Plummer. Not surprised they didn't remember the name.
[11:09.200 --> 11:13.200]  Yeah, that's actually it's not a very good title. In my opinion, little generic,
[11:13.200 --> 11:18.800]  almost sounds like a James Bond movie, like one of the, one of the Brosnan Bond films.
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.560]  Like, could you? Could you trick? Could you trick theme song by Ariana Grande?
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.200]  How many people could you trick into believing that they saw a Brosnan Bond film called all
[11:31.200 --> 11:39.200]  the money in the world? I'll bet you could get a lot of you might get me 30% 3040% more.
[11:40.800 --> 11:46.480]  Like there were at least two that were close to that. Oh, my God. I hope there's somebody from
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.000]  like Eon productions who's listening who listens to the show and they're like, Damn, that would
[11:50.000 --> 12:02.560]  have been a good title. If only we just hit the the 30th anniversary of the world wide web, which
[12:02.560 --> 12:14.800]  is Yes, we did. Kind of crazy. I, I certainly never heard of it in 1999 or 1989. I forget when
[12:14.800 --> 12:21.040]  I heard of it, though. I believe it was. What was the app before nets? Netscape? Was it called
[12:21.040 --> 12:28.320]  Mozilla? I forget what it was called mosaic mosaic. That's it. Mosaic. So I remember mosaic,
[12:28.320 --> 12:35.360]  like 1.0. Obviously, there were other people who were on it before that. But 30 years was my first
[12:35.360 --> 12:42.960]  browser. I'm almost positive. And once again, I can't I can't pinpoint it. And I think I probably
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.240]  could have like if I sat down and talk to a bunch of people, but or not a bunch, but a few key
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.880]  people, you know, who were who sort of introduced me to it, but it had to be about 92 for me, maybe
[12:54.880 --> 13:03.200]  91. So that was when I got my first modem. Yeah. So what I remember, and I've said this before on
[13:03.200 --> 13:07.440]  the show, it's a good thing. I wasn't. I was very young at the time. So maybe I'd be forgiven. But
[13:07.440 --> 13:14.240]  I would have been, I would have been eating a lot of my own claim chowder on the future of the web.
[13:14.240 --> 13:22.000]  Where I thought that the web, I thought it was an interesting demo. This is in the mosaic era.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.280]  But I was like, but it was so slow, that I was like, who the hell would ever use this?
[13:27.280 --> 13:31.600]  Because everything I was doing on the internet was all terminal based, you know, you would open up a
[13:31.600 --> 13:38.640]  Z term, Z term was the app on the Mac where you could dial in to the school modems. And even if
[13:38.640 --> 13:44.240]  you didn't have a great modem, even if you had like a 9600 baud modem, or even 2400 would be 2400
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.640]  was like slow enough where even if you had a clean connection, and you if you were a good typist,
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.280]  you could probably outtype the buffer 9600 was like, got it. If you got a clean phone call,
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.200]  everything you did was fast. And that, to me was the most important thing I was, you know,
[13:59.200 --> 14:08.400]  simultaneously a Mac native Mac app UI snob for all of my regular computing, and a total terminal
[14:08.400 --> 14:14.800]  snob for internetting, for lack of a better word, because it was fast. And it just seemed like this
[14:14.800 --> 14:20.000]  is what it was also what the internet at the time was was built for. It was built for these
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.320]  pure text connections. But then you could like log in and the longest part was just waiting for
[14:24.320 --> 14:29.920]  the modem to connect type elm. All of a sudden, the whole screen was filled with your email,
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.000]  you could see everything that was new. And then you could just sort of down arrow, right arrow
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.360]  return, you know, a couple of keys to, you know, if you only had like three new messages, you'd
[14:37.360 --> 14:42.080]  be in and out and you'd be done. And whereas, like if you tried firing up mosaic at the time,
[14:43.520 --> 14:48.480]  like, you'd watch even if you had a clean connection, you'd watch every page paint in.
[14:48.480 --> 14:53.360]  Curt Jaimungal Yep, top to bottom, or interleave, right? Well,
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.200]  line over line, right? It'd be like, ah, 50% of the lines, we've surrendered them. Now we're
[14:57.200 --> 15:00.800]  going to go back and render the other 50%. Well, didn't wasn't that what we did with we had like,
[15:01.600 --> 15:09.040]  was it GIF or JPEG that had the you could be in G, I believe. No, this is before PNG.
[15:09.040 --> 15:15.200]  It was PNG wasn't invented yet. PNG was invented in the mid 90s. I don't want to go on a long
[15:15.200 --> 15:21.040]  sidetrack on it. But the backstory of PNG is that Eunice, what's, you know, wow, Christ,
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.240]  they used to be a big computer company started with Una. I was gonna say UNICEF, but that's the
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.720]  charity. But I don't know, it was a company that held up my data. Thanks. There was a company that
[15:32.720 --> 15:41.280]  held a patent on the GIF format. And they never enforced it. I will put a link to the Wikipedia
[15:41.280 --> 15:46.000]  era, though, Jeff, let's see what they say. But anyway, they held a patent, but they didn't enforce
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.080]  it. And so the various web browsers used it because it was very efficient for certain images
[15:52.080 --> 16:00.320]  that JPEG wasn't for. And then it took off. And all of a sudden, they had they had a very strong
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.200]  interest in enforcing the patent before it expired. And it was such an old thing that that it was
[16:05.200 --> 16:13.120]  it was expiring soon. And so ping was sort of a let's save the internet and come up with a
[16:13.120 --> 16:19.280]  placement for ping that is unisys. That's the name of the company. Gotcha. Sorry for all I
[16:19.280 --> 16:23.360]  apologize to every listener who thought of it instantly and was dying while while I waited for
[16:23.360 --> 16:27.600]  it to somewhere out there is somebody who also knew all the money in the world right away and
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.760]  wanted to bring in. So I've got two strikes. Exactly. Somebody's ready to stop listening to
[16:33.760 --> 16:37.520]  this episode. You get I bet you you get a lot of the tweets where people aren't done listening.
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.160]  And they're like, Oh, yeah, they're tweeting you the name of things. Yeah. I don't mind. I don't
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.640]  mind keep tweeting. That's totally fine. I actually like an engaged audience. Right? Exactly.
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.320]  It is a reason though, I probably should host a live show all the time with an audience so they
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.680]  can shout answers at me. I guess the answer I guess some of the shows do the IRC thing and
[16:57.680 --> 17:02.800]  people type answers. But yeah, I can't remember what it was. I was filming an episode of the
[17:02.800 --> 17:13.680]  computer show one time. Live one. The computer show by sandwich video. Yeah, yeah. And
[17:16.080 --> 17:21.680]  Adam Lizagor and it's a great show. Super fun. And he was very kind and did a live show in SF and
[17:21.680 --> 17:28.160]  I was one of the non jokey, you know, serious straight man guests that they had on the show.
[17:28.160 --> 17:32.720]  And I don't know, I don't know. I don't know if you weren't you probably weren't in town. He was
[17:32.720 --> 17:38.160]  in SF. It wasn't it was a record. Did it ever thing but did it ever think they did? I don't
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.040]  think he recorded it for posterity, but not for release kind of thing. But you'd have to ask him
[17:43.040 --> 17:47.120]  or I'd have to check. But I don't think it was ever released. It wasn't that kind of thing. It
[17:47.120 --> 17:52.320]  was like, Hey, let's do a live show, you know. And they had the host there. It was a lot of fun.
[17:52.320 --> 18:04.080]  Matt from June oven was on there and myself and pardon me, the other guest I forget who but it
[18:04.080 --> 18:12.800]  was it was fun. It was a lot of fun. But while while we were on the stage, the hosts, you know,
[18:12.800 --> 18:17.760]  very straightforwardly asked me, I'm gonna even forget what it was, but I think it was something
[18:17.760 --> 18:24.160]  so simple, like HTTP or URL or something, you know, like, what does that stand for? What does
[18:24.160 --> 18:34.240]  that mean? You know, the answer the answer was wrong. Like, I was I was dying. I mean, I, you
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.600]  know, it is what it is. But it was so funny to me later, especially because I was like, a room full
[18:39.600 --> 18:47.120]  of nerds. I mean, uber nerds who came to a, you know, a faux computer show, a comedy about a show
[18:47.120 --> 18:54.320]  that never existed in the 80s. Or in the early 90s. And I gave them the wrong answer. But it was
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.960]  it was a lot. It was correct me. I was dying. It's like my nightmare. You know, you're in front of a
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.640]  highly technical audience. And you're supposed to, you know, have some sort of acumen. And you,
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.720]  somebody asks you a fairly simple question in your mind just goes, whoop. It's the best.
[19:09.440 --> 19:13.840]  Anyway, 30 years of the web. Do you see there was a group of people who remade the, the original
[19:13.840 --> 19:21.680]  browser, which was written by Tim Berners Lee on the next workstation was sort of nice. Do you know
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.200]  that? You didn't know that? The original? No, I didn't know that. But I didn't know somebody had
[19:25.200 --> 19:30.640]  no, they recreated it. Yeah, that's cool. Well, I'll have to, I saw somebody tweeted a picture of
[19:30.640 --> 19:35.520]  the actual workstation, which was cool. Oh, that is cool, too. But they remade it in the web, like
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.560]  using modern web technology. So you could play with it, you know, right in your web browser. And
[19:40.560 --> 19:46.800]  it's a pretty good, they have, they have baud settings. No real feel. No, because I think the,
[19:46.800 --> 19:51.840]  I think the idea was that next workstations at the time were all hooked up to university networks.
[19:51.840 --> 19:56.240]  But even the university network was so slow. That's what drove me nuts about mosaic. I was
[19:56.240 --> 20:01.600]  like, this thing has no future. I know. I mean, the, you know, people were like, oh, yeah, I had
[20:01.600 --> 20:10.800]  a 14 four modem. I'm like, No, no, that's thousands. Let's talk in hundreds. Classic, but
[20:10.800 --> 20:17.760]  yeah, I mean, I, I think it was a certainly a world where everybody was trying to understand.
[20:17.760 --> 20:24.640]  And the only the only movie from the era that even got it remotely right was essentially made to be
[20:24.640 --> 20:30.320]  a comedy, which is hackers. I mean, I feel that they just got so much right with that movie. And
[20:30.320 --> 20:34.240]  it was not really meant to be a serious movie at all. And in fact, they got a lot wrong. But like,
[20:34.240 --> 20:41.120]  the ethos was right. Hackers or sneakers? Hackers? No, no, sneakers, for sure. Like that era was was
[20:41.120 --> 20:47.120]  a little bit before that. But I, I think in terms of like the the emergence of the web as a populist
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.240]  enterprise, not a thing for nerds or enterprise, because technically, sneakers is about an
[20:52.240 --> 20:59.280]  enterprise, you know, skunkworks project, right? It's, it's not about users or consumers. And I
[20:59.280 --> 21:04.320]  think that the first like, big, for me, the best big, like, movie that got how the web was going
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.440]  to relate to like, teenagers and hackers who would go on to essentially build the world's largest
[21:09.440 --> 21:13.200]  companies on the internet was was hackers for me, that was
[21:14.160 --> 21:21.040]  you see that the the Captain Marvel website was designed to sort of because it the Captain Marvel
[21:21.040 --> 21:24.880]  movie, which I haven't seen yet, but I'm looking forward to it seems like it's a good movie, but
[21:24.880 --> 21:31.760]  it I think it takes place in like 1995 or so. And so they made the film's official website look as
[21:31.760 --> 21:38.800]  though it were like a GeoCities website from 1995. But then like, I think it was the first person
[21:38.800 --> 21:44.080]  who pointed it out that I have to say it did kind of offend me was as somebody who made websites
[21:44.080 --> 21:51.120]  back then, and used to sweat the details like using what was a debabilizer, which was like the
[21:51.120 --> 21:57.520]  ultimate way to crush every possible bit out of a GIF, you know, without losing any of the actual
[21:57.520 --> 22:03.360]  colors. Like if there was a vague, like an eight byte metadata field that was optional, it would
[22:03.360 --> 22:10.800]  strip it out, you know, just to save a byte. Right. The Captain Marvel website is like totally
[22:10.800 --> 22:16.800]  even though it looks like a 1995 thing with the blink tags, and it's low res GIFs and stuff like
[22:16.800 --> 22:23.680]  that. It's like gigantic. It's like a 20 megabytes download and downloads all of the take it a week
[22:23.680 --> 22:30.960]  and a half. Right. No, it never would have finished. No. No modem connection in history
[22:30.960 --> 22:35.840]  has ever stayed up long enough or stayed up that long, at least in that time to download all right.
[22:35.840 --> 22:40.400]  And there's no computer that could have run it. There was no, nobody had like a computer that
[22:40.400 --> 22:48.240]  had enough RAM to render one tab that that would have been that complex, you know, it's sort of a
[22:48.240 --> 22:54.320]  cheat. Like I don't even know. I don't even know if you could make if you use 1995 markup, would
[22:54.320 --> 23:00.240]  it work? Would it still look like that? I think it would, you know, I, it just speaks to me of,
[23:00.240 --> 23:05.920]  you know, they should have just found some old timers typed all their HTML dedicated. Right.
[23:05.920 --> 23:12.240]  Right. Have you seen Captain Marvel? No, I told you I shouldn't talk about it this soon. Well,
[23:12.240 --> 23:15.920]  you haven't seen it anyway. So we won't talk about it. But yeah, it's really good. I enjoy
[23:15.920 --> 23:20.640]  that a lot. You know, it seems like a good premise. I love the idea that takes place in 1995.
[23:21.520 --> 23:26.080]  Anyway, I'm looking forward to it. But I have not have not seen it. Yeah, yeah. I really wanted
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.440]  a bit completely spoiler free that I think I'll put this out into the universe. But I really feel
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.200]  it is one of the first I mean, it's certainly one of the first superhero movies, but and certainly
[23:35.200 --> 23:44.800]  the highest grossing movie ever to examine, to sort of put on screen. And I speak about this
[23:44.800 --> 23:50.800]  from a distance, but I have read and listened to talk to other people about it. But it sort of
[23:50.800 --> 23:57.520]  puts a female internal life onto the screen in a way that is very, very interesting. It's a very
[23:57.520 --> 24:05.120]  emotionally driven superhero movie, that is not about, you know, how a person's physicality can
[24:05.120 --> 24:10.320]  affect the world, but instead how they feel and think, you know, and putting that on screen in
[24:10.320 --> 24:17.920]  a way that is not it's, you know, almost painterly in its in its application of the way that it does
[24:17.920 --> 24:26.080]  that. And certainly not in the very straightforward way that you know, you normally see a male
[24:26.080 --> 24:30.720]  superhero interact with the universe or the world and you go like, Oh, yeah, I could see
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.920]  what he feels or how he thinks or whatever, you know, it's very, very interesting. But I'll just
[24:35.920 --> 24:43.840]  put that tip it up. It's cool. I loved it a lot. Very nice. Yeah. Why don't I take that perfect
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.520]  segue of the 30th anniversary of the web and tell you about our first sponsor, our good friends at
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.720]  Squarespace. Web may be 30 years old, but I'm telling you, I don't think it's ever been more
[24:54.720 --> 24:59.760]  important that if you want to get yourself out there, whether it's a personal site, a business,
[25:00.640 --> 25:07.200]  a blog, something like that, to start with a solid website, I think there's this backlash against
[25:07.200 --> 25:12.000]  doing everything on social networks. I think it's catching up to people. I think we've all figured
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.720]  out that for an awful lot of stuff. You shouldn't be thinking that you all you need is an app.
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.560]  You need a website. And I'll tell you what the best way to make a website, especially if you're
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.120]  not an expert, but even if you are an expert, even if you are somebody who remembers what I
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.320]  was talking about using de-babilizer back in the day, and, you know, HTML and CSS and JavaScript
[25:32.320 --> 25:37.440]  and JavaScript frameworks, Squarespace can get you up and running with a professional
[25:37.440 --> 25:43.760]  looking website so fast, and it gives you all the control you want. If you're a totally
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.720]  non-technical expert, you'll never leave the WYSIWYG environment of the Squarespace website.
[25:48.720 --> 25:52.880]  You'd use the website itself. You log in. What you see is what you get when it looks the way
[25:52.880 --> 25:57.120]  you want it to look. You're done. And when everybody visits your site, they'll see exactly
[25:57.120 --> 26:03.680]  what you saw when you were dragging and dropping and modifying everything you visit. I guarantee
[26:03.680 --> 26:08.640]  you, you visit websites every week and you have no idea that their Squarespace built Squarespace
[26:08.640 --> 26:14.800]  hosted websites because they don't all look the same. They all let you brand it exactly as far
[26:14.800 --> 26:19.440]  as you want or need to to express your brand. And they have all the features you could want.
[26:19.440 --> 26:23.360]  You can host a blog. You can do podcasts. You can sell stuff. They handle all the commerce.
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.680]  Anything you want to do on a modern website, you can do through Squarespace.
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.520]  It's a great company. Think about them. Next time you or somebody, you know, who comes to you and
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.360]  wants your help and you start rolling your eyes like, ah, now I'm in it because somebody in my
[26:37.360 --> 26:41.120]  family and my brother-in-law needs a website, send them to Squarespace. He'll do it himself.
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.760]  It's so great. What you need to remember, you can just go there and start building a website.
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.080]  You get a free trial, spend like 30 days, get a free trial. Then you have to pay. And when you
[26:52.080 --> 26:59.120]  do pay, remember this code talk show, just T A L K S H O W and you get 10% off and you can get 10%
[26:59.120 --> 27:05.120]  off as much as you pay when you first sign up, including an entire year at advance. So go to
[27:05.120 --> 27:12.960]  squarespace.com slash talk show and remember that code talk show when you actually pay and you'll
[27:12.960 --> 27:19.120]  get 10% off my thanks to Squarespace who haven't been around for 30 years, but I feel like they've
[27:19.120 --> 27:26.400]  been sponsoring my show for 30 years. I've got a lot of other stuff to talk about. I was thinking
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.720]  I would save the Disney stuff for the end. Sure. But this, this is going to be, this is going to
[27:32.720 --> 27:40.000]  turn into America's favorite Disney podcast by the end of this. I have so many questions to ask you
[27:40.000 --> 27:47.920]  and so many things to say let's run through some news. So what else do we have here? WWDC dates
[27:47.920 --> 27:54.000]  were announced earlier today. We're recording on Thursday, March 14th, no surprises at all.
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.400]  June seven or three to seven a lottery for tickets that starts today runs for a week,
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.680]  a little bit shorter window this time by like one day or something. Yeah. It's like last,
[28:07.680 --> 28:12.880]  not too much last year. I keep track of this last year. They announced today, they announced on
[28:12.880 --> 28:18.320]  March 13th and it didn't start till June 4th and I think there was a little bit more of a window
[28:18.320 --> 28:24.080]  for signups for, uh, for lottery. I think what they've figured out is that people who want to go,
[28:25.040 --> 28:31.440]  um, most of them sign up are probably already signed up right now, four hours after it was
[28:31.440 --> 28:34.960]  in. They don't need to give them so much time. Right. Right. Like there's other people,
[28:34.960 --> 28:39.360]  there's a little bit, there's other people who I guess are waiting for like permission from work,
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.520]  you know, but in some ways you could sign up for the lottery before you get permission and,
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.080]  you know, get the clearance, get the clearance after you win the ticket, you know? Right.
[28:48.880 --> 28:52.400]  Same location I go through. I mean, I will tell you just speaking from personal experience and
[28:52.400 --> 28:56.320]  sometimes getting clearance for these things is it's an effort. And so why would you do that if
[28:56.320 --> 29:01.840]  you don't know if you can even go, you know? Right. And I get it. They are non-transferable. It's not
[29:01.840 --> 29:05.520]  like you've got like a golden ticket. You can just hand off to somebody. I think they're non-transferable.
[29:05.520 --> 29:10.400]  I mean, you'd have to, you know, it's like if you have to ask for an exception. Yeah. Yeah.
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.720]  And there's more students slots this time, 350 or so. Oh, I didn't see that.
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.360]  Yeah. That's good to know. Uh, I enjoyed that part last year. Uh, they had a, uh,
[29:23.360 --> 29:29.200]  I spent more time inside last year than two years ago that last year was the second year at the,
[29:29.200 --> 29:36.320]  uh, San Jose convention center or whatever the person's name was on it. And inside the entrance,
[29:36.320 --> 29:45.280]  as I recall, you know, they, um, they also had a new fangled, uh, like RFID type entrance thing
[29:45.280 --> 29:49.840]  where, where you would take your badge. I think they even put it on a nice little snap, you know,
[29:49.840 --> 29:55.760]  thing that you could extend. And then it would be like, welcome, John. Um, and you'd come in and
[29:55.760 --> 30:02.480]  there was a nice little thing that sunlight, you know, but that was like where they had the, uh,
[30:02.480 --> 30:07.280]  ethernet connections, et cetera, for fast downloads of all the betas, because they don't let you do
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.040]  those over the wifi for, for obvious reasons, even though they have very good wifi there.
[30:11.040 --> 30:15.120]  I think part of the reason that's very good is they don't let people download six gigabyte
[30:15.120 --> 30:21.120]  betas of X code, um, over the air. So there's an area where you can plug in and they have
[30:22.000 --> 30:28.800]  ethernet cords and Thunderbolt cords and probably USB-C cords for whatever Mac book you have.
[30:28.800 --> 30:34.080]  And they also had the AR area. Do you remember this? Remember they had gained a couple of games
[30:34.080 --> 30:40.240]  last year. That's right. Uh, you know, and unsurprisingly, the students were very
[30:40.240 --> 30:43.760]  interested in those AR games and they were also very good at them. Remember the games
[30:43.760 --> 30:46.960]  were also very good at them. Remember there was one where it was like, I think it was like Jenga
[30:46.960 --> 30:52.800]  blocks effectively. And you had like a virtual like slingshot on your phone and you, your goal
[30:52.800 --> 30:57.680]  was to knock over like a, sort of like a game of ping pong, you know, two people had crossed from
[30:57.680 --> 31:02.640]  the table from each other, but instead of hitting a ball at each other, you were shooting balls at
[31:02.640 --> 31:07.120]  their blocks. And there was this one kid who, who looked, Hey, he looked like he was like 12.
[31:07.120 --> 31:13.200]  He really might've been 12. And he was like an ACE. Like if there was like an ESPN version of
[31:13.200 --> 31:19.840]  this game, he'd be on it. And it's crazy because the game just came out like a day before they
[31:19.840 --> 31:24.560]  were actually like the Apple people who were staffing the table, like they saw him playing
[31:24.560 --> 31:30.560]  and, and they ran to get the, one of the other staffers who I guess was the best among their
[31:30.560 --> 31:37.120]  staff. Like you got to see this kid. It was, it was all very fun, but the kids, uh, definitely
[31:37.920 --> 31:42.240]  bring up the energy level. They do. And I think it's also a good, you know,
[31:42.240 --> 31:47.680]  sort of concession to the fact that if you're going to invite in a chunk of the, you know,
[31:47.680 --> 31:52.000]  development audience to come and sort of get them excited about this stuff, why not students? I
[31:52.000 --> 31:57.440]  think it's a great idea. Yeah. So it's good. It's, you know, they've, they've regularized
[31:57.440 --> 32:03.680]  everything from the announcement date to the week that it is, you know, everybody expected
[32:03.680 --> 32:10.000]  June three to seven. There were telltale signs in the, uh, public filings for like public spaces
[32:10.000 --> 32:15.600]  in San Jose where I think it actually even said Apple, which is, I guess, you know, it was a no,
[32:15.600 --> 32:22.640]  no, but it's the worst kept secret in Apple on Apple's annual calendar just for various reasons.
[32:23.440 --> 32:29.680]  Which isn't, I like it. I don't know. I think it's not necessarily a bad thing, you know,
[32:31.200 --> 32:36.560]  I do think, I think that a large portion of the reason they keep it secret is that just,
[32:36.560 --> 32:40.320]  you know, things can change. Right. And then everybody's like trying to read into the change,
[32:40.320 --> 32:47.040]  but once you have it locked, announce it. Right. They just, you know, there, there's some part of
[32:47.040 --> 32:52.320]  them. It's, you know, the, you know, the old saying, I'm sure, you know, if you probably
[32:52.320 --> 32:58.240]  heard it from your dad, uh, measure twice, cut once. Right. I think with a lot of these things,
[32:58.240 --> 33:03.920]  Apple is like measure a hundred times, cut once, you know, like they're not going to, you know,
[33:03.920 --> 33:11.920]  they have X, Y, and Z that they definitely want it hope to announce in WWDC. And unless they are
[33:11.920 --> 33:15.360]  that, you know, a hundred percent convinced that there'll be at least an announce-able shape,
[33:15.360 --> 33:20.320]  they're not going to announce WWDC. Like they might, you know, if something happened and,
[33:21.600 --> 33:25.520]  you know, Federighi had to say, you look, I hate to say it, but we're not going to be able to
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.880]  announce iOS 13 on June 3rd. We can't, you know, X, Y, just something's not right. Something will
[33:30.880 --> 33:35.680]  not be ready. They would, they would postpone WWDC, you know, there was that one year, like
[33:35.680 --> 33:41.760]  way back, like 2006 or 2005 or something where they, they did cancel or postpone it to like
[33:41.760 --> 33:46.960]  August or something, which was very strange, but those were, it's almost, almost a different era
[33:47.680 --> 33:54.800]  at Apple. Uh, I also love, I love the way they don't announce that there's going to be a keynote.
[33:54.800 --> 34:02.240]  That's a separate announcement, usually like a week before they're like, Tim Cook was right.
[34:02.240 --> 34:07.600]  Keynote kick off WWDC. Well, are we supposed to believe that Tim might've been too busy,
[34:07.600 --> 34:09.200]  that he's got other things going on or
[34:11.520 --> 34:18.080]  that one. And again, Apple PR, who you and I both have good relations with, but you know,
[34:18.080 --> 34:25.040]  they don't like to explain themselves and they're also ready for you to ask them to explain
[34:25.040 --> 34:30.720]  themselves. And they always have pat answers of, you know, that are more than they're not,
[34:30.720 --> 34:34.640]  they don't just say, ah, no comment. They've got like an answer, but it is effectively no comment.
[34:36.480 --> 34:46.560]  My guess is that they do that just for the pure publicity of getting a boost, getting a little
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.480]  pre WWDC boost into the news cycle, you know? Sure. But it always cracks me up when it's like
[34:52.480 --> 34:58.480]  at the top of tech meme that, you know, WWDC keynote over Monday, June 3rd. Yeah. My reaction
[34:58.480 --> 35:04.000]  is how did they get, how did they get Tim Cook as somebody who runs a conference?
[35:05.680 --> 35:11.040]  That's my joking response. It's like, Oh man, how'd they get Tim Cook? His schedule. So busy.
[35:11.040 --> 35:16.400]  How'd they get him to come to our conference? How'd they get him again? Yeah. Yeah. Again,
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.400]  every time, man, they're playing favorites. All right. And imagine how weird it'd be if
[35:20.400 --> 35:26.000]  there were no keynote for WWDC. Like everybody would be like, what the hell is going on?
[35:27.440 --> 35:31.040]  This is nuts. If they just started with the technical state of the union and it's
[35:31.920 --> 35:37.680]  there, I'm showing up objective C and Swift code on slides two minutes. I would love it.
[35:37.680 --> 35:43.920]  I would love it. One year. That'd be amazing. Like CNN is there going and expecting the big
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.520]  corporate news and they're like, wait, what API, what? Right. In theory, that would be,
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.080]  you know, the way to do a developer conference keynote. You know, the, I always say that's the
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.840]  best way to think of the state of the union. The state of the union is like the technical keynote.
[35:58.480 --> 36:06.000]  That's right. You know, it would work for the audience. It would not work for the CNNs of the
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.120]  world. Yeah. I mean, and then, you know, the thing is, yes, there's a different sort of like the,
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.520]  I don't know, inside, inside baseball on some of this stuff, which you well know,
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.960]  but some audience members might not know is that they kind of consolidated press
[36:21.920 --> 36:26.480]  for a lot of their events. So a lot of these events, WWDC has always to some degree been
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.560]  that way. Cause it's the one, it's the one thing, right? It only happens one place always does,
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.320]  but a lot of their events, they've taken a lot of international press and people that
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.880]  would have normally maybe had their own events in their own cities, you know, hosted at an Apple
[36:38.880 --> 36:45.040]  store or, or hosted, you know, kind of tele, tele, uh, telegraphed or whatever. Um, what do you call
[36:45.040 --> 36:49.840]  it? Oh my gosh. You know, teleconferenced teleconferenced in or whatever. They brought
[36:49.840 --> 36:54.400]  them all in person, which is great. You know, I think that's fine. And why shouldn't people
[36:54.400 --> 36:59.280]  around the world that Apple's a global enterprise iPhone goes on sale in every country right away.
[36:59.280 --> 37:03.120]  Why shouldn't they have all these international press there? But it certainly has changed the mix
[37:03.120 --> 37:07.440]  a little bit in press. And certainly of course, in this new era of Apple, the mix
[37:07.440 --> 37:14.400]  of press has changed significantly. Um, but the audience makeup at those things is by nature,
[37:14.400 --> 37:19.360]  always going to be these nerds. Right. And for a lot of, you will see the tweeting patterns. I
[37:19.360 --> 37:23.440]  mean, you and I follow a lot of these folks and we are these folks at some degree, you know,
[37:23.440 --> 37:26.880]  and so you'll see the tweeting patterns, you know, you'll see people going like,
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.240]  Oh, here's the corporate jumbo, you know, like all of this stuff. And Oh, here we go. Retail update,
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.800]  like people around the world are sort of like taking the numbers, even, even, you know,
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.360]  my staff, my reporters, they're taking those numbers, comparing them against previous numbers,
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.760]  writing analysis of that. Okay, here's the growth curve and you know, et cetera, et cetera. Right.
[37:45.760 --> 37:49.600]  But the people in this audience are like, Hey, give us the stuff. And like, you know,
[37:49.600 --> 37:53.280]  they start to get excited the moment they see something announced on stage that they see that
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.400]  they could maybe integrate or take advantage of, you know, or, or sort of build, you know,
[37:58.400 --> 38:03.040]  something with, uh, that's their, that's their thing. So it's an interesting audience. I always
[38:03.040 --> 38:09.920]  like it. I enjoy it. It's a different energy than say an iPhone, um, pure, pure press event.
[38:09.920 --> 38:14.560]  Right. Sure. Exactly. Um, yeah. If they telegraphed the thing, it would,
[38:14.560 --> 38:17.920]  that would take them right back to like the 2,400 baud modem era.
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.080]  I kept it. Yes.
[38:24.880 --> 38:27.680]  Maybe you should have flown from Asia over to California because
[38:29.040 --> 38:32.960]  you don't know Morse code. I'm sorry. All of our remotes are via teletype this year.
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.000]  So no, I've told this story on the show before, but last year,
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.800]  it must've been the phone announcement because it was in the Steve jobs theater and, um,
[38:42.800 --> 38:48.640]  they supplied the foreign, I don't know how many languages, but it's certainly at least Chinese,
[38:48.640 --> 38:55.120]  I think, um, maybe Japanese too, but a couple of the foreign language people got little in-ear
[38:55.120 --> 39:03.520]  pieces. Like you get it like the, um, um, the UN. And so they were sitting live in the Steve jobs
[39:03.520 --> 39:08.880]  theater, but they were getting a live translation of what was being said on stage. And there was
[39:08.880 --> 39:13.200]  some sort of, I don't know if it was a malfunction or just that they were poorly set up, but they
[39:13.200 --> 39:20.080]  were turned up too loud and it was too loud to be in their ears. Um, and so they took them out
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.840]  and I don't blame them. I wouldn't put something too loud in my ears, but they took them out and
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.760]  it was loud enough that they could hear it just holding next to their ear. But it also meant that
[39:27.760 --> 39:33.440]  while you were sitting in the audience, you heard these, this like, why do I hear like electronic
[39:33.440 --> 39:38.960]  Chinese language? What, who is doing this? And then like, you turn around, it'd be like, I thought
[39:38.960 --> 39:41.920]  it was over my left shoulder and then all of a sudden it's over my right shoulder. And I'm like,
[39:41.920 --> 39:45.280]  what the hell is going on? I really thought somebody was doing like a FaceTime call and I
[39:45.280 --> 39:50.000]  thought it was very rude. Turned out it wasn't, it wasn't rudeness at all. It was just like a
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  technical thing, but it really, it emphasized just how many of the members of the press
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.240]  really are from, uh, around the world at these events. And that did not used to be the case.
[40:00.240 --> 40:04.960]  That's true. And then one of the byproducts of people being around the world is that they are
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.640]  interpreting, many of them stream it or are, you know, kind of producing videos live. And so they
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.280]  will translate for their audience live and they have no compunctions about translating it full,
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.880]  full volume right next to you. It's, it's great. Like I have no problem with, with, um,
[40:21.840 --> 40:26.240]  translating live because I think they're definitely, they're providing the same service we
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.680]  are, you know, is just, uh, sometimes a little difficult to hear over them. Um, it's a lot of
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.040]  fun having everybody there though. I love the fact that it's international community and it's people
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.040]  that I wouldn't get to interact with from the press, even though we're in the same industry
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.120]  and same business and they're, they're writing for a very similar audience, just in a different
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.840]  language. I love being able to like talk to them and interact with them and get their viewpoint.
[40:49.840 --> 40:55.280]  And they're always so enthused about being there. Um, and again, talking to the people in the U S so
[40:55.280 --> 40:59.760]  it's, it's a lot of fun. It's actually, um, quite a different vibe than it used to be where you'd
[40:59.760 --> 41:05.120]  see the scene people sort of in, um, you know, every event. So that's, that aspect of it is
[41:05.120 --> 41:09.120]  really, really cool to me. We were at, we probably talked about it the last time you were on the
[41:09.120 --> 41:14.560]  show, but we, you and I sat together for the, um, the Brooklyn event in October and there were
[41:14.560 --> 41:21.600]  a lot of retail employees from around the country who'd been invited. Um, and you know, and some
[41:21.600 --> 41:26.320]  part of Apple has always filled seats with Apple employees, you know, like, um, you know, if the
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.360]  watch team has a big announcement, some number of people from the Apple watch team get to attend the
[41:31.360 --> 41:42.080]  keynote. So famously last year in the, uh, in the September event when, uh, Jeff, Jeff, uh, uh, why
[41:42.080 --> 41:48.000]  am I drawing a blank on his name? The C COO, Jeff Williams came on stage. He got in a super
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.000]  enthusiastic, uh, uh, amount of applause from one section of the theater and that was the watch team
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.440]  and you can't blame them, but it was a little weird when you were there. Like, why, why are those
[41:57.440 --> 42:04.640]  people so nuts for Jeff Williams? Um, but like the enthusiasm is about to announce his collab with
[42:04.640 --> 42:11.680]  Pitbull, uh, his new single. Yeah. The enthusiasm of those retail folks in the audience though was
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.320]  different and more palpable because none of them had ever seen a keynote live. They obviously got
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.560]  selected by being the good employees who maybe were there a long time, but were enthusiastic
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.160]  about Apple stuff and they were, some of them are sitting right behind us and they were just,
[42:26.160 --> 42:30.480]  their enthusiasm was so palpable and it's like you and I just sit there and sort of have a,
[42:30.480 --> 42:34.960]  we don't, we don't clap at press events thing and there's people behind us going absolutely nuts,
[42:34.960 --> 42:43.440]  but not like in a phony way. Uh, and I, you know, just made it a cool thing. I like WDC, you know,
[42:43.440 --> 42:47.920]  I, you know, cause it is unique. It's, there is no other, even, you know, the Brooklyn thing was
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.440]  in the Academy of Music and it's a beautiful venue and they've, they've done this thing where
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.800]  they go around the country these days for certain of their special event, but nothing compares to
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.640]  having like five or 6,000 people in a room. It's it. And most, most of them just being attendees,
[43:02.640 --> 43:07.760]  you know, and every year now it's a ton of first time employees or attendees, not employees,
[43:07.760 --> 43:14.080]  attendees. Um, the energy level is just not comparable to any of the other events.
[43:16.480 --> 43:20.560]  Did you go to, you don't go to the, uh, annual shareholders meeting, do you?
[43:21.440 --> 43:26.400]  No, no, I've never been either. Uh, a, I'm not a shareholder. Uh, I guess I could get a press pass.
[43:26.400 --> 43:30.800]  I don't know, but it's just, you can get a press pass, but yeah, I'm not a shareholder either.
[43:30.800 --> 43:34.720]  Uh, nothing. It doesn't seem worth a cross country trip. There's, cause it's just not,
[43:34.720 --> 43:39.760]  I don't write the finance angle much and I, whatever I do, I'd rather just read a summary
[43:39.760 --> 43:45.760]  of somebody who knows more about it than I do. Um, but somebody who went, who's just a DF reader,
[43:45.760 --> 43:50.880]  um, but was really happy to go. Cause I think this was the first year where they held the shareholders
[43:50.880 --> 43:56.880]  meeting in the Steve jobs theater. And so that it is a cool thing to see. I mean,
[43:57.440 --> 44:01.960]  it is a gorgeous theater and it is unlike anything I've ever seen. Um,
[44:01.960 --> 44:07.240]  so I could see why somebody, you know, I, if it were, if it weren't cost prohibitive to make
[44:07.240 --> 44:10.200]  the trip and I were a shareholder and I'd never been to the Steve jobs theater,
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.720]  I'd be interested to do it just for that. But anyway, this reader sent me a picture
[44:13.720 --> 44:18.600]  from his audience. He was like, I've always heard that the screen is amazing here, but this is,
[44:18.600 --> 44:23.000]  you know, this looks like six 40 by four 80 projection and it's hard to tell from an iPhone
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.840]  photo, but it really, it certainly wasn't the screen that they use at the press events.
[44:26.840 --> 44:32.520]  It was, Hey, it was clearly projected, you know, there's sort of that look of a projected image
[44:33.400 --> 44:38.040]  and front projection, front projection. And the screens that they have now are like
[44:38.040 --> 44:45.560]  leds or OLEDs or I dunno, some kind of thing that the screen itself lights up. So I don't know what
[44:45.560 --> 44:50.760]  the reason is, but they, they cheaped out on that for shareholders, apparently, unless, unless this
[44:50.760 --> 44:56.760]  photo was tremendously misleading along with this deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,
[44:56.760 --> 45:04.040]  DF readers eyes. So anybody out there, they broke out the Mac classic projector. Well,
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.480]  I just wonder when he said that and he wrote, and I know that I've, I've raved about the
[45:09.480 --> 45:15.160]  display technology and the Steve jobs theater and the audio quality. And I just wonder how
[45:15.160 --> 45:20.360]  many other daring fireball readers went to this and thought, what the hell is Gruber raving about
[45:20.360 --> 45:27.400]  this screen looks like, like it costs 50 bucks. What is going on with this guy's eyes?
[45:29.560 --> 45:35.320]  Oh man, that's funny. Oh, all right. WWDC nothing else to say though, other than dates.
[45:37.640 --> 45:42.440]  The other Apple thing, which is breaking news coming out tonight, it'll be out by the time
[45:42.440 --> 45:50.040]  this shows out is Apple has a new TV commercial about privacy. And then you have a piece in
[45:50.040 --> 45:56.600]  tech crunch with a preview of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, you know, being marketing privacy
[45:56.600 --> 46:02.120]  stuff for a while now, I really don't think it's a, you know, any secret to anybody that they view
[46:02.120 --> 46:10.600]  this as a tool for marketing now, uh, as well as an internal, you know, belief framework, whatever
[46:10.600 --> 46:17.720]  you want to call it. Um, certainly there's been over the years, they've had a natural inclination
[46:17.720 --> 46:26.280]  towards, you know, privacy and, and, um, you know, uh, protecting users data and that sort of thing.
[46:26.280 --> 46:30.200]  But only, it was only a couple of years ago that they really started to try it out as a marketing
[46:30.200 --> 46:35.240]  tool and sort of positioning tool, both in terms of, you know, personal speeches, things that Tim
[46:35.240 --> 46:40.200]  Cook said, interviews, and then also of course, marketing. Um, you know, obviously there's,
[46:41.160 --> 46:47.000]  there's big marketing efforts. Apple had a big billboard at MWC, um, with the iPhone, you know,
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.400]  touting its privacy features and things like that. Right. It was like what it was because,
[46:51.400 --> 46:57.560]  but because that's in Vegas, it was like, uh, what, what happened? MWC season Barcelona. Oh,
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.880]  well they had one in Vegas too. Oh, okay. Gotcha. It was like, what happens? I didn't see that one
[47:01.880 --> 47:06.040]  on your iPhone stays on your iPhone, you know, playing off the, what happens in Vegas stays
[47:06.040 --> 47:12.520]  in Vegas. Catchphrase of this, of the city. Yeah. It makes sense. Um, but anyhow, they've been
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.920]  doing that for a while now. So this is a prime time TV commercial. Um, it's going to be on their
[47:16.920 --> 47:21.560]  YouTube channel by the time you hear this. And then, um, of course you can see it, uh, in my
[47:21.560 --> 47:29.480]  piece, but the, um, actual commercials airing on prime time TV. Uh, so, you know, evening,
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.120]  wherever you are in the U S um, that's going through March madness and then it's going to
[47:34.120 --> 47:40.680]  be airing, I think, uh, worldwide after that, uh, in select regions. But it's a, you know,
[47:40.680 --> 47:45.800]  it's a big buy. It's an ad buy for them that they would normally buy. It is an iPhone commercial,
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.040]  right at its core, but it's just the point of it is basically instead of, Hey, here's the new iPhone,
[47:52.040 --> 47:56.360]  you should buy it because of the camera. It's here's the new iPhone. You should buy it because
[47:56.360 --> 48:02.200]  privacy. That's the sort of, and not to spoil it, but it's a commercial, so I don't mind spoiling
[48:02.200 --> 48:06.840]  it, but it basically, it doesn't tell you upfront. It's an iPhone. Do you don't see people using
[48:06.840 --> 48:12.760]  iPhones? What you instead see people are in real life situations like, uh, using a public restroom
[48:12.760 --> 48:17.480]  or a woman putting on makeup in a car and the guy next to her is staring at her and she just rolls
[48:17.480 --> 48:23.720]  the window up, you know, to get a little privacy. It's just a whole bunch of maybe three, four
[48:23.720 --> 48:30.120]  second vignettes of places in real life where you might want a little privacy in the public space
[48:30.920 --> 48:36.040]  and what people do to do it. You know, nothing's really hysterical, but they're all vaguely
[48:36.040 --> 48:40.440]  amusing. But you're like, where's this? I think part of the gimmick of the ad is the first time
[48:40.440 --> 48:46.040]  you see it, where's it going? You know, who is this for? And then the closer is, Hey, if you
[48:46.040 --> 48:49.880]  want privacy, you care about privacy in real life. You should care about it on your phone
[48:49.880 --> 48:54.200]  or something like that. Yeah, exactly. And it's one of those ads where the product really isn't in
[48:54.200 --> 48:59.480]  the commercial until nobody has an iPhone out in it throughout the entire commercial. It's all
[48:59.480 --> 49:04.120]  about real life scenarios. And that to me is the interesting angle. Like it is amusing. It's a
[49:04.120 --> 49:11.480]  couple of things that are kind of funny. But I do the underlying premise to me really emphasizes
[49:11.480 --> 49:18.520]  how we've collectively have gotten into this mess where our digital online lives are such a privacy
[49:18.520 --> 49:26.360]  nightmare is that in real life, it's sort of intuitive, you know, like the one, you know,
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.760]  it's, you know, silliest form of privacy, but there's one where there's just a line of urinals
[49:30.760 --> 49:34.600]  in a public restroom and one's being used and a guy is sort of absentmindedly walking up,
[49:34.600 --> 49:39.080]  realizes he was going to take the one right next to the guy, and then just backs over and takes
[49:39.080 --> 49:45.240]  one, you know, two spots away. Right. You, you, you don't even think about things like that. You
[49:45.240 --> 49:49.320]  just intuitively think, Oh, I'll take this one because it'll give me the most privacy,
[49:49.320 --> 49:59.400]  you know, while I do it. And it's not so obvious online. And then in fact, as we've seen more and
[49:59.400 --> 50:07.880]  more, a lot of it is insidious and you need to be like an expert level network wizard to even
[50:10.440 --> 50:15.400]  right. You, you, you, there's no way that a normal person would even realize
[50:16.600 --> 50:22.760]  how cookies are being used to, you know, get you the ad for the pair of boots you search for on
[50:22.760 --> 50:30.600]  Amazon on a, you know, the, a movie preview site a week later, you know, it's not the systems
[50:30.600 --> 50:38.680]  experts that build these systems are building them. And you could, I think in many ways,
[50:38.680 --> 50:45.480]  you could argue that their intent isn't necessarily to obfuscate obfuscate the fact that,
[50:45.480 --> 50:50.600]  you know, your information is passing through several hands before it, you know, causes this
[50:50.600 --> 50:55.720]  effect or whatever the case may be. But the product, every, the, the result is that the
[50:55.720 --> 50:59.720]  result is that it's out, it obfuscates that stuff. So it makes it completely, you know,
[50:59.720 --> 51:06.920]  unaware to the normal person. And in many cases, not all, but many cases, they are intending to
[51:06.920 --> 51:12.920]  obfuscate it because it doesn't do them any favors to explain it to you clearly. Um, just sounds
[51:12.920 --> 51:22.200]  creepy, you know, you know, and to make a super obvious point throughout history until very
[51:22.200 --> 51:29.160]  recently, um, your privacy could be regulated using just your natural senses, you know,
[51:29.160 --> 51:35.480]  your sense of vision, your sense of hearing, you know, if you're in a restaurant and you're
[51:35.480 --> 51:40.920]  telling somebody something private, you regulate the volume of your voice in a very natural way
[51:40.920 --> 51:47.560]  without thinking about, you know, you just kind of know, like, Hey, there's somebody at the table
[51:47.560 --> 51:51.560]  right next to me. I'm going to, you know, I'm going to speak to this in a lower voice because
[51:51.560 --> 51:57.080]  I'm saying something I want to keep private. Um, right. There is no way that your five senses
[51:57.080 --> 52:02.120]  really help you online in terms of keeping track of that and what's being stored and what's not,
[52:02.120 --> 52:09.240]  and what's encrypted and what's not, you know, I mean, there's the closest thing that we have
[52:09.240 --> 52:15.080]  to that kind of ESP is a network monitor, you know, and most people don't know how to install
[52:15.080 --> 52:18.840]  those, don't even know what they are. And then even if you know what they are, it's still a
[52:18.840 --> 52:24.360]  pain to use one and then you have to be able to interpret them. And once again, do they do their
[52:24.360 --> 52:29.880]  best to obfuscate, you know, that traffic, right? It's, it's, you know, so technically you are using
[52:29.880 --> 52:34.680]  your eyes to look at the output of the network monitor, but it's a cerebral action to, to
[52:34.680 --> 52:40.920]  understand it and to process it and see how to do it. Whereas knowing to lower your shades,
[52:40.920 --> 52:45.080]  when you change your clothes or knowing to, you know, lower your voice, when you're
[52:45.800 --> 52:49.960]  speaking a secret, you don't, it's not cerebral at all. It just comes naturally
[52:49.960 --> 52:57.080]  unless you're some sort of idiot. I think it's a good ad. I think it's a good ad. And I think
[52:57.080 --> 53:01.480]  it's interesting that Apple's doing a push around it, you know, and I, you know, these, I know a lot
[53:01.480 --> 53:06.120]  of people out there aren't a quote unquote sports ball fans, but like a big March Madness buy is
[53:06.120 --> 53:11.960]  pretty big and it's a good way to reach a very broad audience. It's, you know, certainly a good
[53:11.960 --> 53:17.720]  18 to 24 demo audience, you know, people with buying power, purchasing power. So there's a lot
[53:17.720 --> 53:23.880]  of, you know, savvy that goes into these buys, but that they would put instead of the camera or,
[53:24.680 --> 53:30.840]  you know, some other feature screen that they would put privacy in that slot isn't interesting,
[53:30.840 --> 53:36.280]  certainly an interesting display of how strongly they believe that that is a differentiating factor
[53:36.280 --> 53:42.120]  for for them. You know, I don't know, I mean, you know, we don't have to discuss the ins and outs
[53:42.120 --> 53:47.560]  of all of it here. But I absolutely think that people will in it to some valid degree, you know,
[53:47.560 --> 53:55.000]  point out that why I'm going to just going to point it out, taking an ethical or moral high
[53:55.000 --> 54:03.160]  ground and making it a product feature is a is a dangerous maneuver. Because then you have to
[54:03.160 --> 54:07.880]  sort of you have to back it up, you have to, you know, realize that like, if you're going to pitch
[54:07.880 --> 54:13.560]  this as a product, that product has to work right, right, it has to be consistent. And they certainly
[54:14.600 --> 54:20.280]  there's very many cases you can make for the efforts that Apple has made to sort of,
[54:20.280 --> 54:26.680]  you know, make put the money where their mouth is and and certainly make, you know, make effort
[54:27.400 --> 54:34.360]  to make sure that their product decisions and sales decisions and relationship with the consumer,
[54:34.360 --> 54:40.280]  it aligns well with that message, right? So they definitely do. They're not just it's not complete
[54:40.280 --> 54:47.320]  BS, in other words. But there's a, you know, this spot, for instance, very, very closely associates
[54:47.320 --> 54:51.560]  the concepts of privacy and security. You know, they're separate, but they're interrelated,
[54:51.560 --> 54:55.880]  obviously, right. And they've had some issues recently with like the FaceTime bug that allowed
[54:55.880 --> 55:02.280]  that kind of like eavesdropping thing, obviously unintentional, patched, you know, they apologized,
[55:02.280 --> 55:08.120]  etc. But then you have things like, you know, Facebook kind of being able to ship this sort of
[55:08.120 --> 55:15.320]  spyware or malware app. Malware may be a little strong, but definitely spyware app on the App Store.
[55:15.320 --> 55:24.200]  A scattering of bad actors using the enterprise certificate program to like ship gambling apps,
[55:24.200 --> 55:30.200]  other things that Apple doesn't allow on the store to iPhone users at scale. We're not talking about
[55:30.200 --> 55:35.080]  just one or two people, but, you know, hundreds of thousands or more people. So you know, they've
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.680]  had recent incidents that have kind of pointed out that it's it's not perfect, you know, their stance
[55:40.680 --> 55:46.120]  is not perfect. They're not, you know, it's not a completely pristine wall that they're offering.
[55:46.120 --> 55:53.480]  But I think, personally, I do feel that, you know, there's still a major difference between a
[55:53.480 --> 56:00.360]  company that has a situational loss of privacy, either via a bug or whatever, while having a
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.640]  systemic dedication to privacy, and that most of the rest of the ecosystem that exists out there
[56:05.640 --> 56:11.720]  operates as like with this invasion of privacy as a service model. And there's a significant
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.680]  difference between those two things, between a company that's willing to back up their stance,
[56:16.680 --> 56:23.240]  and to make honest and genuine and significant efforts to keep user data private and to keep
[56:23.240 --> 56:29.000]  that data secure, of course, to then ensure the privacy. And then, you know, a lot of what the
[56:29.000 --> 56:33.720]  rest of the industry does, basically, you know, stating privacy as your mission is still
[56:33.720 --> 56:39.080]  supportable, even if you have bugs. But attempting to ignore that you host the data platforms
[56:39.080 --> 56:45.240]  that thrive on this stuff is a little bit of prestidigitation on their part. But I still
[56:45.240 --> 56:48.760]  think that they have a they have a leg to stand on basically in this in this regard.
[56:48.760 --> 56:51.960]  Trenton Larkin I mentioned on my last episode with Renee,
[56:52.520 --> 56:56.600]  and I won't go into a long rant on it again, because it was a good rant on the last episode.
[56:56.600 --> 57:02.920]  But basically, that to me, the elephant in the room on Apple's pro privacy slant is very specific,
[57:02.920 --> 57:09.320]  and it's their, it's their deal with Google to make Google search the default search in Safari.
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.560]  And, you know, that's a very tightly held secret. Neither company is I don't think
[57:13.560 --> 57:18.840]  officially revealed it. But like Goldman Sachs has estimated it that last year, it was like
[57:18.840 --> 57:24.360]  $9 billion in that for this 2019, it's going to be like 12 billion or something like that.
[57:24.920 --> 57:32.200]  It's a lot of money. And it's very hard to say, to me, there's there's a hole in the argument
[57:32.200 --> 57:37.800]  where if they say we're, we value your privacy, and Google doesn't. And I know they're not calling
[57:37.800 --> 57:42.760]  Google or anybody else specifically out by name in this ad. But there's certainly implying that
[57:42.760 --> 57:48.840]  every you know, there's sort of an everybody else that isn't yet we're going to take $10 billion to
[57:48.840 --> 57:54.360]  give them the default web search, which is one of the ways that they track you right now and what
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.440]  you're searching for. And they keep you logged in. And when you, you know, log into any Google
[57:58.440 --> 58:04.760]  service, and they encourage you to log in just for using web search. I'm not saying it makes
[58:04.760 --> 58:10.600]  them hypocrites, but it makes them at least partial hypocrites. And just the thing that
[58:10.600 --> 58:15.640]  occurred to me after that episode, before this episode, but only shortly enough before the
[58:15.640 --> 58:21.960]  episode that I, I searched for it for five minutes, was just to put $10 billion a year,
[58:21.960 --> 58:26.520]  because let's just call it that for the sake of argument, if it was estimated at 9 billion last
[58:26.520 --> 58:31.000]  year and 12 billion this year, let's just say right now, it's up to 10 billion a year. What
[58:31.000 --> 58:38.280]  how does that compare to what these companies pay in in corporate income tax. And Apple pays more
[58:38.280 --> 58:44.360]  than anybody in corporate income tax, they paid something like $15 billion. So Apple almost makes
[58:44.360 --> 58:49.960]  enough from Google to cover its corporate income tax. Google has had a very flood the last three
[58:49.960 --> 58:58.280]  years, they got hit hard by the repatriation. So they paid a bigger lump sum two years ago. But
[58:58.280 --> 59:06.680]  like in 2017, they only paid like $5 billion in US corporate taxes. So they pay more they pay by
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.800]  what I'm looking at over the last few years, they pay more on an annual basis to Apple to make
[59:11.800 --> 59:18.760]  Google search the default Safari search, then they paid to the US government and corporate income
[59:18.760 --> 59:25.720]  tax, like a lot more, maybe arguably around double. So that just puts it in scale just how
[59:25.720 --> 59:29.160]  much and the other thing I looked up is Google last year, they had a record breaking year for
[59:29.160 --> 59:37.720]  revenue, they had 130 some billion in revenue, and paid Apple roughly 10% of their revenue.
[59:38.920 --> 59:44.120]  Or at least they're paying them this year, roughly 10% of last year's revenue to make to keep Google
[59:44.120 --> 59:51.240]  search the default search in Safari, which puts it in scale. And I think tells you just how
[59:51.880 --> 01:00:00.680]  unbelievably profitable the iOS using audience is to Google in terms of how they make money from
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.760]  web ads. That's right.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.600]  Yeah, it's insanely valuable to them. I mean, it's like it's like propping the door
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.080]  to your house open with a diamond, because it's that important that you get air.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.160]  You know, it's nothing to that diamond is nothing to them compared to the diamond
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:23.880]  mind that they have. I mean, I think there's a, an absolute argument that when it comes to,
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.680]  you know, Apple adjudicating what should be considered, you know, a societal norm when
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:33.160]  it comes to the use of personal data on smartphones, you know, if it's going to be
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:39.480]  the absolute arbiter of what flies on the world's arguably most profitable application marketplace,
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.360]  it might as well use that power to get a little bit more feisty, because that make their living
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.280]  on our data, you know. So, you know, I don't know, I think there's absolutely an argument for that.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.040]  Hey, while we're on this, there was a story that broke and follow it closely, because
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  I just had a lot of other stuff to read. But there was a story that broke that Facebook is under an
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.080]  actual criminal investigation. Did you see anything about this for privacy violations,
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:11.320]  and that the if this was like in the Eastern District in New York, and that two US cell phone
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:19.160]  manufacturers were like listed as like witnesses or something like that. And I had a couple people
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.720]  say, Do you think this is Apple? Do you think this is about like, back when Facebook was built
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:29.160]  into iOS? And I was like, I don't think it's Apple, because it seems to me like this is
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.120]  something different. This is like some kind of co marketing deal where Facebook was paying companies
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:42.600]  to allow them to collect data that was never, never prompted the user even in an obfuscated
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.400]  way to get their permission. It was like they made a deal with company x so that Facebook was
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:55.000]  able to track certain things that a user used on company x's phones. But this, this thing that
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.800]  was announced about it doesn't say who the companies are. So I don't know. And there
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.680]  aren't that many US companies that make cell phones. I mean, there's Motorola, trying to
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:09.880]  think who else? I don't know. I feel like it's a story we have to keep our eyes on. We don't
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.680]  really know much about yet. Yeah, I don't know much about it either. I know. I've got people
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.120]  tracking it, but I haven't personally been tracking it. So I don't know. Yeah, I didn't know
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:24.120]  that it happened. But that's about it. Yeah, we'll file it away for future episodes. All right,
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.920]  let's, I guess we could keep going with the Boeing thing. Do you want to talk about the Boeing
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.240]  thing? Are you an airplane nerd? I am a little bit of an aviation. All right, well, let's go
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.240]  with the Boeing thing and then we'll take a break. You know, it's tragedy. So it's hard. You know,
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.240]  on the one hand, I wanted to say this, you know, to anybody, if you know, happened in Ethiopia,
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.400]  the latest crash, so it may not be anybody listening and knows anybody, but it's a tragedy.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.320]  And I feel a little guilty nerding out on this. Like it's a bug, you know, like the FaceTime bug
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.320]  you mentioned bad bug, really bad bug. Nobody died. You know, we're talking about a thing here
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.240]  that left a couple hundred people dead, right? Let's just acknowledge that that's a tragedy.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:07.320]  But as nerds, I find the story, the more I read about the story of this, the more fascinating it
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:17.960]  is as a tragedy of human error. When I first saw it, when I first saw the story, I saw that
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.200]  another plane had crashed. The first one was, where was the first one? Indonesia or something?
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:29.240]  I forget. But you know, a second foreign somewhere else around the world is Boeing 737 Max 8,
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:36.040]  which is their latest model for a single aisle air passenger plane, meaning it's small enough.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:42.200]  Mostly, I'm guessing almost everybody listening to this has been on a 737 or an Airbus 320 or 321.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.640]  Just a typical single aisle plane, three seats on each side and coach two seats on each side
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.880]  in first class or business. The second one had gone down. And because it was the second time
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.800]  since October, a lot of places around the world just sort of hit the panic button and said, okay,
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:09.000]  let's ground these planes. And the FAA in the US didn't and Canada didn't. And the FAA is kind of
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.280]  considered the gold standard for this sort of thing around the world. At least in my opinion,
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.280]  I was talking to Ben Thompson, who's also in aviation, and he agreed. And so it's a little
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.720]  weird that everybody else didn't follow the FAA lead. But instead, they grounded them while the
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.080]  FAA was still saying we, we, you know, we think this is okay. And Boeing was still saying we
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:38.600]  think this plane's okay. But as more and the FAA is always been aggressive, right? It falls across
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.240]  all kinds of regulatory things. I mean, anytime you ask yourself a question about, you know,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.440]  why does some nonsensical thing happen with air travel or planes or grounding or delays? It's
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.720]  usually, you know, because the FAA is being overly cautious, right? They're typically known for being
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.320]  relatively conservative, right? And the reason, you know, and, and the results show it air travel
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.080]  historically has been a very safe way to travel famously, everybody knows that statistically to
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:11.160]  go from point A to point B, in a motor vehicle on the road, no matter what type of motor vehicle,
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.640]  you have a way higher chance of being injured or killed way higher than you do in air travel. It's
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:21.720]  really the safest way to go from point A to point B statistically. But psychologically, if for
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:28.520]  obvious reasons, you know, putting yourself into an aluminum tube, 30,000 feet in the air is not
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:35.880]  exactly something we're hooked up to accept psychologically by evolution. You know, usually
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:41.560]  if you're up in the air, more than if you're about to die, you're you're in big trouble,
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.680]  let alone 30,000 feet. So psychologically, and you know, I, so I'm not making fun of anybody who has
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:54.200]  flight anxiety, I tend not to. But it I totally understand it, it is easily one of the most
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.920]  understandable phobias from even a rational sense, just because it just seems crazy.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:08.520]  But the long story short of this is that Boeing really put themselves as I understand it,
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:14.280]  Boeing put themselves in a bad hole, because they were developing the 787, which was a bigger plane,
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.720]  and decided to develop it in a different way for Boeing, where they outsourced a lot of it,
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:27.880]  as opposed to doing it in house, and thinking that would save money. And it was didn't,
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:35.160]  it led to all sorts of delays, and delays cost them money, tons of money. So it ended up costing
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:45.480]  them a lot more, and the 787 was very late. And because of that, they sort of got like the money
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.280]  maker is the 737. And I think most of us who fly frequently know that most of you know, you're way
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:58.600]  more likely to end up on a 737 or a 320 size plane than you are, you know, a bigger bird 747,
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.920]  fuel efficiency and route length. And and just how many passengers they expect on the plane,
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.520]  they're not going to fly an empty plane, they're only going to use those big ones when they can
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:11.880]  fill the seats. And who knows, maybe on a lot of them, it'd be easier to fly two smaller planes
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:19.400]  than one bigger plane to get everybody from city A to city B. But the 737 has long class has long
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:26.200]  been Boeing's big money maker, and but they sort of let it languish while they were wasting all
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:33.160]  this money on the 787. And in the meantime, their arch rival Airbus has come out with a new 320,
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.920]  the 320 Neo, I believe it's called, which has bigger engines, the bigger engines,
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:44.600]  make it more fuel efficient, I believe it, I believe the exact number is 14%. So if you replace
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:49.800]  like a regular, you know, the previous 320 with the new 320, you save 14% on each trip on fuel,
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:56.760]  which is super significant, you can imagine. And in the meantime, Boeing didn't really have
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:02.680]  anything and really was originally planning to do a ground up, we're going to make an all new
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.920]  airplane to replace our 737. Who knows, they probably would have come up with a new number
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.640]  for them. But their single engine or single aisle, which is something I hadn't really thought of
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:16.520]  before, but it's a great way to describe this class of plane, the single aisle passenger plane,
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.600]  they, they decided we're too late, you know, like, we don't have enough time to do this
[01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.640]  Airbus is killing, you know, is taking our business, and this is our most profitable thing.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:36.040]  And so they're like, Well, what can we do with the 737 to, to get a new 37 737 into this with
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:41.960]  the fuel efficiency that led them to put bigger engines on a 737, which in turn changed the
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.000]  aerodynamics of a plane that wasn't originally designed for it and notoriously has sort of low
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:56.120]  wings and doesn't really have a lot of room. And the other x factor is that to keep costs down.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.760]  And this is something I had no idea about that pilot certification is such that you can come out
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.680]  with like a new 320 that like the 320 Neo, if a pilot is already certified on the previous 320,
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:14.840]  the 320 Neo is sufficiently similar that their count is certified on the Neo. And if if it's new,
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.720]  too new and too different, and the pilots all have to be recertified, that's a big cost for
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.920]  the airline, because they've got to spend all this money to get all of these pilots
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.120]  certified on a new plane. And so this and this is where it all went bad for Boeing. I think
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:36.120]  they, they put this software MCAS, some kind of automatic control system in that was modified the,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.920]  you know, the flight pattern of the plane automatically to somehow make it fly more
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:46.360]  similarly to previous 37 37. And they can you take it from here?
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:59.160]  And can you take it from here? Yeah, I mean, the automated software was a
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:13.080]  it absolutely was a a pilot assist feature. Right. Right. And the the pilot assist feature was
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:21.080]  a, I think it was mostly like an altitude related feature. Yeah, I did read that. So,
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.960]  yeah, and an angle of attack. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And you're, you're basically what you have
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.520]  in a plane is like there's a, there's the most efficient way to fly it. And then there's like
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.600]  the safest way to fly it. And usually, you know, you're somewhere in between because you want to,
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.840]  you don't make a flight efficient, but you want to make it, you know, you also want it to, you know,
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:51.000]  come in safely. So there was like the the analyze the flight pattern of the crash jet, and they
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.400]  looked at it at takeoff, and they looked at the Lion Air crash. And they saw that they basically
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:02.760]  showed similar fluctuations in height, like vertical, whether they call them oscillation,
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:08.680]  or fluctuations in height. And they basically were able to, once they looked at the wreckage
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.600]  and analyze that they were able to do that, take that and satellite tracking and understand that
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.320]  they needed to investigate further and that it was very likely this software package that was,
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.880]  you know, the issue and the pilots reported on the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:32.680]  control problems to the aircraft controller before they came down. But the computerized system that
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:38.600]  they put in place was a it was supposed to basically assist them in keeping the proper
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:46.040]  altitude to get the proper lift. But what happened is after if it if it decided that it was not
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:52.360]  working right, it would just it would just cut out. And then they couldn't take proper control
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.720]  over it. Yeah. I got an email from somebody who obviously knows exactly what he's talking about.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:03.640]  He wrote like his PhD dissertation on the complexity of commercial airline cockpits.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:10.840]  And it was a super, super interesting email. But like one of the things he said is, as you might
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:17.720]  expect, is probably no surprise to you, but like a sensor on an airplane, a faulty sensor, a sensor
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:25.000]  that as you know, like it needs a complete fleet wide recall. The difference might be 99.99%
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.840]  accurate versus or success rate versus 99.999% accurate like this is it's not like, you know,
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.320]  it's like a one in 10,000 thing, but one in 10,000 is unacceptable in the airline industry.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:42.040]  And one of the problems with this MCAS system is that it was relying entirely on one sensor
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:47.240]  to detect the thing that it was to try and trying to detect and that that one sensor
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.480]  people are suspecting, you know, may have a higher than acceptable
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:59.720]  prosperity to give an erroneous result. Yeah, basically, the MCAS, given the very,
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:06.280]  very tiny amount of like, difference that it saw, that was like a 20 degree difference in angle of
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:12.360]  attack between the left and right sides of the plane. And so it basically kept taking the yoke
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.080]  out of the pilot's hands and pushing it forward, like pushing the nose down. And then they
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.400]  basically had to keep yanking the yoke back up, forcing it to come back up. So the other thing
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.360]  that this this guy's email said, and I haven't read this anywhere else. And he said, this is
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.200]  speculation. And so this, you know, this could be wrong. And who knows? So you know, this is a
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:36.760]  podcast. So it's all right. But on on most other commercial airliners, one of the one of the ways
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:43.240]  to just to, to disable all autopilot features is to just pull back hard on the yoke, you pull
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.040]  back hard enough on the yoke, and all autopilot Oh, you don't Yeah, you don't want me to take
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:53.720]  control. Anything autopilot related, turns off, you know, and then there's switches. And he thinks
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:01.640]  that with this MCAS thing, it's only a switch. Got it. And so yeah, that oscillation specifically
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:09.640]  cover controls trim, I believe, and is basically it. If they'd have known, I don't think they even
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:14.520]  knew. That's what the conclusion is so far that they didn't even know the MCS was causing the
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.720]  problem, right? So they didn't know to switch it off, right? So they could have. But yes, I believe
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.520]  you're right. Like it wasn't this thing where it was kind of connected to the autopilot features
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.840]  where they grab the yoke and yank it and they expect, okay, I'm back in control of this thing.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.720]  And in fact, the MCS was still at work, still with its faulty data about about angle of attack,
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:41.160]  and it's pushing the nose of the plane down. Yeah. And they didn't know to switch it off.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.400]  If they switched it off, they could have gained control back. Right. But since they didn't know
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.800]  that it was the issue, they couldn't actually do it. Right. And those oscillations you're
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.320]  referring to on both flights were exactly like 15 seconds apart each time. So they would like
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.960]  take control. And it'd be like, Okay, we got it. And then 15 seconds later, it would dive again.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.720]  And they were like, you know, I'm sure they were panicking. I'm sure. Well, probably not panicking,
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.920]  because pilots are, you know, trained, you know, their pilots, because they don't. But they were
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.000]  probably in aviation called being behind the plane. Yeah, that's when you don't understand
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.480]  why a plane is doing something. Yeah. And that's what I think the state that they entered into was
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:20.360]  it's you end up in this scenario where you are trying to make corrections for something, but you
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.280]  don't know the cause of it. Right. But having these, you know, you'd, you'd, you'd get the
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.880]  plane going back up. And then 15 seconds later, the plane would decide itself to point the nose
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.720]  down. And then 15 seconds later, the same thing happens, does look exactly like a software problem,
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.720]  like 15 seconds is when it, you know, the scent, you know, the thing goes, let's take a reading
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:46.200]  up reading still bad go down. Whereas like they said, like an often form of oscillation in general,
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.600]  of course, is turbulence, but turbulence doesn't tend to come at exact 15 second intervals,
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.920]  it might be, you know, seven seconds, then 20 seconds, then 17 seconds, you know, because
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:02.440]  it's a natural phenomenon, not something written in software. I thought the yoke argument and
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:07.640]  again, speculation from somebody, I didn't read that in a confirmed thing. But I do think as a
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:13.160]  user interface nerd, I think that's super interesting, because what is the best user
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:19.080]  interface for a pilot to take control of the airplane from autopilot that that they suspect
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:28.760]  is gone awry, pull back on the yoke, right? Mm hmm. pull back on the yoke disconnects it, you know?
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.760]  I mean, isn't that how I don't really use cruise control a lot on cars, but isn't isn't
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:37.880]  like when you hit the brake cruise control goes off. Usually it's a break tab. Yeah. And I don't
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:42.760]  remember and I mean, I've had cars with cruise control for years, and I feel I should know this,
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.720]  but I think some cars most cars, perhaps with cruise control, if you hit the gas,
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.200]  it does not disengage, it just allows you to speed up, right? And it will fall back to this
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:56.680]  last setting, right? Yeah, that's how my cruise control works is gas you can use to go a little
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.120]  faster than you had it set. And then it just drops you right back to where you had it set,
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:07.080]  which for me is usually still extremely fast, you know, 91 92 miles an hour. But brake is like,
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.080]  okay, turn off the cruise control, which is obvious sense. And you don't want somebody
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:17.960]  stabbing at the little cruise control button on the steering wheel to disable it. You know,
[01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.040]  and again, I'm not trying to, you know, it's an oversimplification to compare driving a
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:29.880]  Honda with flying a 737 Max. But still, there's that moment of I got to, you know, Oh,
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.120]  what's your instinct? And as a driver, you hit the brake, and as a pilot, you pull back on the yoke,
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:41.240]  especially if the problem is the nose going down. So it's sort of a user interface problem,
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:50.840]  sort of a corporate planning problem, sort of a, a cheapskate bureaucracy problem in terms of this,
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:54.440]  you know, the whole reason for this software patch in the first place was to avoid having
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:18:01.080]  to retrain pilots on this plane that they probably should have had to now, you know, not again,
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.360]  maybe there's, you know, there's nothing fundamentally, fundamentally wrong with these
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.720]  planes. But if the pilots had been retrained on them, as though they were the new planes,
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.760]  they should have been treated as it every, every pilot would have known what to do,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.680]  how to identify it and what to do. Yeah,
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:27.240]  yeah, I mean, it's the software assistance is one of those things that you know, I mean,
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:36.280]  obviously has existed and will existed or will exist for forever, you know, with with aviation,
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:44.280]  but it is a there's a reason that we still have human pilots, you know, and there's a reason that
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:50.120]  almost every aviation disaster that's averted can be linked almost directly to pilot experience.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.040]  And that, you know, that's, that's just this right in the pocket of this thing, you know,
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.880]  that happened here. One of the things I read is that Boeing has a reputation in the world of
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.760]  aviation as being a very pilot forward company that they've always thought the pilot should be
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:10.280]  at the center of this, you know, that they're not trying to obviate pilots, they're they're trying
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:14.520]  to help them, but that they've, you know, famous, you know, maybe more than other companies have
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.560]  designed around. We just want to we're going to assume that there's an expert pilot at the at the
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:26.600]  helm at all times. Yeah, and how do we augment their ability to keep the plane safe and, you
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:31.960]  know, fly the plane rather than how do we supplant them, you know, them as a decision maker, which is
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.840]  I think, you know, it's definitely an argument for and against in the aviation industry, because they
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:41.320]  feel that, you know, pilots get tired, and they're human, and they're fallible and all this stuff.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.200]  But yeah, it's the back and forth over that. Right. And then the other thing that looks really
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:53.080]  damning, and I know it's only five reports, but that the Dallas Morning News found five reports
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.600]  that pilots had filed over the last few months ever since the the Lion Air crash in October,
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:07.960]  flying 737 Max eight planes in the United States. And all seemingly with the in the same scenario
[01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:14.520]  shortly after takeoff, a bit of a loss, you know, the nose goes down. And you know, these guys all
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:21.560]  figured out it's the luckily, I guess, or to, you know, all figured out it was this MCAS system
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:26.920]  disabled it took control of the plane, everything was right afterwards. But one of the complaints
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:31.800]  from the pilot called it like use the actual word unconscionable that you know, that the manual that
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.960]  they had for the plane doesn't really emphasize this enough, you know, that they sort of had to
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:43.320]  figure it out on the fly. Which again, speaks to this whole not that there's anything wrong with
[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.520]  the plane, but that there's something wrong with trying to say this, if you're good on any previous
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.480]  37, you're good on this new one. And it really wasn't, you know, and that's purely for financial
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:00.840]  reasons, which is a really bad look when it when the stakes are so high. Right. The other
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:05.720]  conclusion to draw from this, I have to say, you know, again, it's a bit of speculation,
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.920]  but it's a bad look at the moment, at least is that like you said, the FAA and my understanding
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:18.200]  is the FAA has a reputation of being aggressive on on calling for like grounding of a plane or,
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:23.240]  you know, calling, you know, doing something, even if it means greatly inconveniencing air travelers,
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:30.440]  you know, in the name of safety, and that the FAA was last to do it. And Boeing happens to be
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:37.000]  the US manufacturer, sort of is a bad look at the moment. And I wouldn't be surprised if that turns
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:43.480]  into some aspect of the scandal, you know, that if this had been an Airbus plane with the same
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:48.440]  problem in those two countries, maybe they would have pulled the trigger on grounding them sooner.
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:56.600]  Mm hmm. Yeah, that's so true. And, you know, it really sucks, you know, that you have to think
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.520]  this way. This didn't stay in age, but it really does. I mean, you know, some people who are and
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:08.840]  I'm not by any means a Washington insider or nor do I follow this stuff. But in some people who
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:15.320]  hear this may be like, yeah, you know, this is the way the world works. But, you know, the moment like
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.520]  Trump tweeted something about, you know, hey, this is, you know, we're gonna ground these things or
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.600]  whatever they should be grounded, etc. And then the FAA quickly announced that they were doing it.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:31.320]  I don't know which came first or whatever. But the first thing I did was I thought to myself,
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.600]  let me Google who the senators are in Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, and they're both
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.520]  Democratic. No, you mean, Democratic Senator Seattle is I thought they were Seattle,
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:45.720]  Washington. Oh, I think I think both of them think Boeing Corporation is in Chicago, but I could be
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.200]  wrong. Anyhow, is it but you know, you it doesn't really matter even if that was the case in the
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.960]  fact that it's the political and money motivations, you know, behind Yeah, keep these bowings in the
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.920]  air. You know, that's bad press. We can't have them having that we'll fix it quietly. Or, you
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.680]  know, I'm gonna say something about it because it'll hurt the other guy. It doesn't matter. You
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.560]  know, it doesn't matter if that was the case here. It's always is the case.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:14.200]  Well, in addition to Boeing, the other two big corporations that are most direct US corporations
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.920]  most directly involved are Southwest and American Airlines, because they're the two that have
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.320]  purchased the most of them or have the most in their active fleet. So like Southwest,
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:27.880]  you'd want to look at Texas where you've got I know offhand, you've got cornering and Ted Cruz,
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:34.360]  who are Republican senators, although Cruz. I saw that Cruz who heads like a senate committee on
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:40.360]  aviation was calling for them to be grounded before the FAA actually said it. So I'll just
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:44.840]  point that out that from what I've seen about that, I don't I don't think there was an angle
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.560]  there that like Ted Cruz was pushing for them to stay in the air because of Southwest Airlines
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:53.800]  being headquartered in Texas. I think the opposite. I think Ted Cruz was a little bit ahead of the
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:59.400]  curve on, you know, let's put these things on the ground. Anyway, I don't think Boeing has handled
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:06.200]  this well, in my opinion, because Boeing also was, you know, defending it. And even to this point,
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:12.360]  and even, you know, they've, they're grounded worldwide, but they didn't get out ahead of this.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:18.280]  And I all I can think of to compare it to is the, the Tylenol scandal, which I don't have in front
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:24.120]  of me, but you remember, you were probably a kid. Yeah, I was, but I do remember it probably from
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:30.840]  discussion later on, not at the moment. So I, again, didn't do the research, but so I'll speak
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:35.320]  off the top of my head and probably get something wrong. But at some point in the 80s, at some point
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.640]  in the 80s, some psychopath working in a factory, it put like cyanide in a bunch of Tylenol
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:50.600]  packaging and people, I think people died. Not too many, but, you know, but it somehow,
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.960]  it was quickly determined that these people had all taken Tylenol and Tylenol figured out where
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:01.080]  these packages had come from, from the serial numbers on the packaging. And they knew very
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.120]  quickly, you know, they could have said, just take all cereal, everything that came out of this,
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:11.800]  like, let's say plant, take them all off the shelves. But instead what they did, and very
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:17.400]  quickly is like the CEO of Tylenol said, take anything with the word Tylenol on it of any
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.560]  product from any place, take it all off the shelves and destroy it all. Just, you know,
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:27.560]  let's get rid of it all to be as safe as possible. Even knowing that that was actually well above
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:32.280]  and beyond what they needed. They knew where this guy worked. They figured it out. They could have
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:39.800]  just taken off the products that might've been from the place where he worked. But by doing that,
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:46.280]  it, it, it like kept the Tylenol brand from being tarnished in the least, like, like worldwide,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:49.880]  people were like, yeah, I can still, you know, even though people had just been poisoned by
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:55.560]  Tylenol, they bought the fact that like, you know, with, within days of this thing even happening,
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.120]  the CEO was saying, let's just destroy every, every bit of it worldwide. And, you know,
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.240]  you know, and then they came up with tamper-proof packaging, et cetera, et cetera. You know,
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:08.280]  back when I was a kid, you just opened a pack of pills from the store and you didn't have to
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:16.680]  poke holes in anything. It was right. But famously considered one of the sages
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.720]  public relations moves and executive has ever made, you know, and who knows how many untold
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:30.600]  millions, hundreds of millions who, how much money and Tylenol product was destroyed, you know,
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:35.640]  that didn't need to be, but it was all in the name of let's, you know, let's not forget that
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:40.760]  whatever many millions or billions of dollars of Tylenol is out there. I think they even told
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.040]  people to throw the Tylenol out in their home. You know, if you've got any Tylenol in your home,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:52.360]  throw it out. And you know, it also, I think there's a lot of people who would think, well,
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:58.120]  that's, that's the risky PR move, right? The risky PR move is to, to be there saying,
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.840]  throw it all out, you know? But in hindsight, it's considered, you know, an active, you know,
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.000]  to borrow a Phil Schiller term courage, you know, and I think everybody would agree it was,
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.160]  and everybody agrees in hindsight, it was the right way to do it. I can't help but think that
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:20.440]  maybe Boeing should have been way ahead of the curve, like after this, the second crash and
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:25.080]  saying, Hey, we don't think there's anything wrong with these planes, but we would like everybody
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:31.720]  around the world to ground them while we do conduct a thorough investigation. I can't help
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.960]  but think that that was a better way for Boeing to play this, especially from everything I've
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:44.680]  read in the last like 48 hours. Yeah, I mean, it just seems so obvious, you know,
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.200]  that you would just go ground them immediately until we figure it out, you know, and we'll,
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:54.200]  we'll figure out, we'll help the airlines figure out how to get you where you need to go,
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:00.200]  but we can't use these planes. It's just, you know, after even the first crash, because it's,
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.640]  it was obvious with the first crash that there was some sort of plane fall and it's like,
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:11.240]  I don't know, systemic, you know? Um, and that's, uh, it just, I don't know, it's boggles,
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:16.440]  it boggles money really screws with people. It really does.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  Yeah. There's like an old saying once his chance, twice as coincidence, third time as a pattern.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.640]  And I kind of feel it was something like air travel. Once you get to twice, you lower that
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:33.720]  by at least once I see one, I say, yeah, you're lower it by at least one. I think, I think you,
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.880]  I think you say two as a pattern and write an act from there. And I have to say that's,
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:42.280]  as contrary to my initial read over the weekend when I wasn't really paying attention,
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:48.200]  uh, you know, I kind of feel like I, as a non expert, total non-expert and not even
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.360]  really an aviation nerd, although I'm suddenly turning into one with this. Um,
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:29:02.360]  there was a story I linked to, uh, his name is, uh, John, uh, Ostrower. And he writes,
[01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:07.400]  he's a long time aviation industry reporter and he writes his own website now called the air current.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.960]  And he had a great piece. I linked to it from during fireball yesterday. I learned a lot from
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.360]  it really. A lot of what I said before was just restating with what I learned from him. But, um,
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.000]  he had a comment, you know, he's a well source, so he, you know, it's anonymous sources,
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.680]  but somebody in the aviation industry said that if these two crashes had happened one in October
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:31.880]  and one in March, but the airlines had been Southwest and American, they, they would have
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:37.800]  grounded these planes hours after the, the second one. It was the fact that there was sort of a bias
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.680]  within the FAA that, well, who knows how good Ethiopian airlines, like they don't maintain
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.840]  their planes or they don't train their pilots. Right. Yeah. And I hate to say that my sort of
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:53.720]  casual read from the news over the weekend might've been along the same lines. Like I might've
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.320]  just as a knee jerk pundit screaming at the government, what to do, you know,
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:06.680]  I might've had a different take too. Yeah. Let's take a break and I will thank our next sponsor
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:18.360]  who is Euro. Look, Euro makes wifi for humans. Basic premise behind Euro wifi systems is called
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:24.360]  a mesh network. You get multiple devices, basic starting pack as three for Euro, put them around
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.040]  your home, they talk to each other and then they envelop your whole house, your whole office,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.280]  whatever you've got with one network based on these three things that talk to each other.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:39.320]  Talk to each other. And it's just common sense. Really. You don't have to be a wifi engineer to
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:47.160]  really understand the, the, the basic idea that having one router in one spot to cover your whole
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:51.720]  home, your whole office, wherever you're trying to do it, it's going to have trouble getting
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.120]  through all the walls and everything. And then spreading a couple out that all can talk to each
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:03.880]  other and create one seamless network is an easier way to do it. But in addition to the fact that
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:11.160]  it's just a better way to envelop your whole home with a wife, one wifi network it's really,
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:19.800]  really easy to set up and administer basically do the whole thing with an app on your phone
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:27.480]  or on your iPad. Couldn't be easier to set up. It's super easy to do things like add a new one.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:31.400]  You just go in there and say, add one. And it says, what do you want to name it? Like you can
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:39.080]  name it like, you know, third floor hallway, whatever you want to do, add one, that sort of
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:46.360]  thing. You can monitor all the devices that are on the network. You can easily set up a guest network,
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:49.640]  which I'm a fan of. I don't really like having people come to my house and get on my main
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:57.000]  network. Love having a guest network, super easy to set it up, super easy to monitor it.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:06.120]  And they've also got Euro plus Euro plus is a service that you pay extra for. And it lets you
[01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:14.920]  do all sorts of extra stuff. Let's you set up your own way to block malicious and unwanted content
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.560]  across the network. You can filter for adult content for stuff like monitoring your kids
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:26.520]  or something like that. It does add blocking optionally content blocking. It can automatically
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:32.920]  tag sites that can contain all sorts of stuff like violent, illegal adult content. So you can
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:39.080]  choose what the people on your network can see, don't see. They even have features when you sign
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:45.640]  up for it. Do you even get stuff like VPN protection from encrypt.me password management
[01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:51.240]  from the great one password and even antivirus software from malware bytes. If you want it,
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:57.720]  it's a great setup. Really the single router model is just going the right way. The dodo bird.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.680]  So if you're looking to upgrade your home network to something with a mesh network,
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:11.080]  Euro has a great starter kit. And also I will add this, I've used it. They have incredible
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:16.520]  customer support and it's something that they've really invested deeply in. You can call them up
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.280]  and just get ahold of a wifi expert within 30 seconds. You get a real human being right here
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:26.200]  in the United States. And if you have any kind of problem during setup, you can do it. I forget the
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.760]  problem I had like a year ago, something when I moved, but I called them up, they walked me
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:37.080]  through it. Couldn't have been easier. Very, very simple. So we, I'm talking to right now,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:43.000]  if you hear this, I'm talking to Matthew over an ero network really has changed the wifi
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.800]  in my house for the better tremendously. I've been using them for years.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:53.960]  Here's the deal. Never think about wifi again, get a hundred bucks off the Euro base unit and
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.400]  two beacons package. That's the base unit. That's the little thing of puck size thing about the size
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:05.320]  of a Apple TV and the beacons are little wall units that even have like little nightlights.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:11.720]  You just plug them right into a wall socket and one year of Euro plus. So save a hundred bucks
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:18.280]  on that. You get the base unit, two beacons and a year of Euro plus service. Just go to
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:26.120]  ero.com slash the talk show, ero.com slash the talk show and at checkout, just enter that code,
[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:33.240]  the talk show. My thanks to Euro for their continuing support of the talk show.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.480]  I don't want to spend too much time on it cause I want to nerd out on Disney,
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:44.040]  but I'm sure you read the Elizabeth Warren, let's break up these tech companies thing.
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:56.440]  And her initial, it was a post on medium and it was focused on Amazon, Facebook and Google.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:04.040]  And then I think she was at South by Southwest. I think that the medium post was timed for that.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:10.760]  And the verge got an interview with her and asked the obvious question that there's one company
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:14.680]  that's obviously missing from that. And she said Apple and they're like, what do you want to break
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:21.080]  Apple up to? And she said, Oh yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on this and I haven't been able to
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.680]  express it. Number one, a lot of what she's saying isn't really breaking these companies up. I get
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:34.200]  it. But like AT&T, the old AT&T, the old mob bell thing that was breaking up a monopoly that was
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.320]  taking a nationwide company and breaking it up to a bunch of regional, much smaller companies.
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:46.840]  What she's proposing in each of these cases isn't really breaking up with possibly the exception of
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.800]  Facebook, which I guess would kind of qualify as a breakup because I think what the gist of her
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.480]  argument with Facebook is that they shouldn't be allowed to own Instagram and WhatsApp too. And so
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:01.560]  I guess they were component parts. They could become component parts again. It sort of makes
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:07.720]  sense. Yeah. It also seems like the less, you know, yeah, it's breaking up Facebook, the
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:14.840]  corporation, but not breaking up Facebook. The thing that we think of is Facebook. And honestly,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:22.600]  probably not a bad idea. Like of all of the parts, my thoughts on her advice for these companies
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:29.240]  range from, hmm, this Facebook thing maybe ought to be pursued. And, you know,
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.360]  the Instagram thing, when that was approved, I forget what year it was. I know they bought them
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:43.320]  for the, at this point, famously good value of $1 billion. I don't know. It's also known as one
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:49.800]  Instagram for quite a while. Cause that's like, that we use that. Oh, how many Instagrams,
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.240]  two Instagrams? That's what they bought it for. When they bought WhatsApp for 20 Instagrams,
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:02.680]  I feel like we as a country at that point should have known better. And that one should not have
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:11.400]  been approved, you know, with Amazon, but well with Google, she's got this argument, you know,
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:17.960]  or a bit, I hate to paraphrase it all, but, uh, basically her problem with Google, I mostly agree
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:23.400]  with too, which is that they shouldn't be able to leverage Google search to favor their other
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:30.840]  properties. Right. I mean, that's something that stop them from Yelp has been screaming about for
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.080]  years. You know what I mean? I mean, people, people have been pissed about that for a very
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:40.040]  long time. And in fact, they have been fined several times over this scenario where they
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:46.520]  were taking, you know, saying like, Oh, Hey, you can pay for an ad to go above a competitor's thing,
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.440]  but then they're putting their own listings. When you just search for a random thing,
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:53.320]  you think you're getting the listing that you searched for, but really you're getting
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.000]  something that pays Google. So they're earning money on both sides of the deal.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.720]  So I'm, I'm amenable to that argument and I'm with you. Like Yelp is a really good example
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:08.040]  where that really does seem like what they did to Yelp. I mean, Yelp is still around. They haven't
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:13.080]  put Yelp out of business, but I do think that they damaged Yelp in a way that qualifies as
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:18.040]  traditional anti-compet illegal anti-competitive behavior where they leverage, you know, Google
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:23.320]  search to favor their own listings for these restaurants and encourage people to rank them
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:29.320]  and rate them and do Yelp like user things so that Google could build their own Yelp like service.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:38.600]  Um, but it is, I have to say though, it is hard. It is a little bit to me, less cut and dry. The
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:44.120]  analogy in the tech world I think would be to the windows, the Microsoft windows, uh, antitrust saga
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:52.520]  of the nineties, where one of the things they were accused of was favoring their own office apps over
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:39:01.080]  competitors like Lotus one, two, three, and word perfect and et cetera. Um, but even that, and I,
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:05.160]  you know, I I've said this over the years on the show a lot, even, you know, I don't have the
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:11.400]  archive going back far enough at during fireball to say it, but even as a strong Mac fan at the
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:20.040]  time and someone who did not see Microsoft's incredible dominance of the industry as a good
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:26.680]  thing for the industry, I always felt about the whole antitrust argument because to me, yes,
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:35.640]  they did take some actions against those apps, um, you know, to, they leveraged the windows monopoly
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.240]  in ways that favored office in certain ways. And there probably should have been some action
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:44.680]  against them, but in other ways I felt like the arguments against it were missing the ways that
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:51.720]  Microsoft just won in some ways fair and square. Like it was Microsoft that had the idea to bundle
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:58.280]  all three, to make all three, the spreadsheet, the word processor, and uh, what am I missing?
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:06.120]  What's the third part of an office suite? Oh, the, the, uh, PowerPoint to do all three and bundle
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:12.200]  them as a suite. And remember, most of those things were sold by seats back then and they
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:18.040]  were very expensive, you know, like a copy of word was like 300 bucks. Uh, and they were the ones who
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:23.960]  were like, well, you could pay 300 bucks each for $900 or we'll bundle them all together for $600
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:28.360]  or something like that, you know, which, you know, in hindsight, you know, today's world,
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.800]  you think $600 for a copy of a word processor and a spreadsheet. It seems like a lot of money,
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.440]  but you know, that was the world we're in then, but you could get this bundle for less and they
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:44.280]  did a lot of work to make them work together so that you could put spreadsheets in your word docs
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:49.480]  and PowerPoint and, you know, get a spreadsheet into PowerPoint, et cetera, et cetera, that,
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:56.200]  that having, you know, a word processor from one company like word perfect and your spreadsheet from
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.160]  Lotus, you didn't get that integration. There were things Microsoft did that part of the rise
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:08.120]  of office wasn't, wasn't just cheating. Similarly with Google search that at some point,
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:12.920]  you know, if the best, if the whole idea is that if it's truly honest, if they're just being the
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:18.760]  most honest search engine, they can be, and you type words in the field and hit return
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.880]  and they're making their best guess as to what it is you're looking for.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:28.520]  It might be another Google product, right? Right. It's it like, it's not easy to,
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:33.480]  it's not easy to say that they shouldn't ever put other Google products at the top of the search
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:44.040]  list. It's, it's, it, it requires nuance, you know, and we get to Amazon and her argument with
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:50.280]  Amazon to me makes no sense at all. This is the point where to me, her argument belies to me,
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:57.160]  she doesn't really seem to understand how Amazon works. She keeps talking about these product
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:03.400]  platforms or, or something like that. And she doesn't want Amazon to act as its own store.
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.720]  If they're running a product marketplace, you know, which is what Amazon has evolved into,
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.200]  where other sellers, I think we're all familiar with this now that you search for something on
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.800]  Amazon and you look for who the seller is. It may not be Amazon. It's, you know, quite often not,
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.200]  right. You know, that you and I can start a company selling, you know, coffee cup lids
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:30.040]  or something like that. And rather than sell them through Matthew and John's coffee cup lid
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.920]  company.com or in addition to, we can sell them through Amazon. And when people search for them
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:42.920]  on Amazon now, they'll get them through there. But basically I don't think this is a stretch.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:47.080]  What she's saying is that Amazon shouldn't be allowed to operate its own store, which is what
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:54.280]  most people think of Amazon has. Yeah. I mean, the, the problem with the arguments about Amazon
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:58.760]  and, and, you know, to some degree arguments about other com these other companies is that
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.080]  when you don't have like a, a true technical understanding of what they are and how they do
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.880]  what they do. Um, I'm not saying that you shouldn't be able to comment on it. There are certain
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:13.240]  market forces that play. For instance, it's somebody who doesn't understand the technical
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:18.600]  aspects, but somebody who does understand the fiscal aspects of it are even more qualified to
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:22.760]  talk about. They're like, I don't care how it's done. Here's why it's wrong. Right. But I don't
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:28.040]  think it's being tackled that way. I think, you know, when you tackle things on a, on technical
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:35.320]  merit or on, you know, precise methods of execution of what they do, your arguments can be
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:41.880]  often blunted or, or distorted or made ineffective by not truly understanding the way that these
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.200]  things work. And I think that's one of the, the sort of benefits to having, you know, people who
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:53.160]  truly understand this stuff, write about it and talk about it and kind of analyze it is because
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:58.120]  they understand that if you talk about these things and you have a platform like Elizabeth
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.320]  Warren does to say, Hey, maybe these companies are too powerful. We should examine that. Why,
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:08.200]  what should we do about it? You need to get your technical arguments correct. Cause if you don't,
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:12.760]  it blunts the efficacy of your argument. Yeah. One of her arguments, and it's like the most
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:18.120]  highlighted into the way that medium shows you the most highlighted passage in an article,
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.320]  the one that's most highlighted. And I don't know if that's because people are agreeing with it or
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.960]  because people are selecting it to say like, what the hell is she talking about? Is she saying like,
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:32.520]  Hey, the government busted up Microsoft in in the nineties. Aren't you glad that we get to use
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:38.680]  Google for web search instead of Bing? And that really wasn't, that wasn't,
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:45.960]  it's a nonsense sentence, essentially. It's Google aid. Wasn't even a thing at that time.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.240]  It was actually all about, I don't know, part of the argument was about Netscape, which most,
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:55.720]  you know, if she said like, aren't you glad we, aren't you glad we get to still get to use Netscape
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:01.080]  instead of being forced to use IE? That would actually be a little bit more accurate as to
[01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:05.160]  what the case was about. And everybody would be like, I don't use IE. I don't use Netscape.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:10.760]  Right. Yeah, exactly. I mean, the, you know, the, being the most highlighted thing makes
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:16.200]  you wonder whether it's being highlighted ironically or being highlighted, you know,
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.600]  genuinely. And you know, that, that kind of statement, like using Google instead of being
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:26.680]  stuck with being a it's painting being as an inferior product, which many people would make
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:32.360]  an argument that it is. Sure. Great. Right. So we're stuck with being, okay, well, that's the,
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:40.200]  that's the result of what you did to Microsoft. What the government did to Microsoft. So anyhow,
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.760]  yeah, it's, it is, it's wheels within wheels of how you can pick the argument apart. Well,
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.120]  I think that's what the point I was trying to make. It's a weak argument. It's like,
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.400]  it could be the point of the argument is actually worth talking about, but having a weak argument
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:00.520]  does it as a disservice. It does the conversation at the service, the, the, the nineties mentality.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:05.480]  And there's a reason for the mentality because it was true for the, throughout the eighties and
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:10.680]  nineties was that the important thing was to be the company making the software that ran on
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:16.760]  people's and businesses PCs. So Microsoft, you know, is the one who was the most successful and
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:22.440]  they made the operating system that ran on your PCs on your PC, right under your fingertips.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:29.640]  And they made these office apps that ran on your PC right there. And then the web and Netscape
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:34.440]  became this big thing and Netscape had a big IPO and, and was getting all this momentum.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.200]  And there was a mentality at the time that the most important thing to control would be the
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:46.360]  browser because the browser was the app that ran on your PC. And it still is important. You know,
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:50.760]  we were just talking about Apple and Safari and how much money they make from Google by having
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:57.400]  Safari and Chrome is certainly a big strategic aspect of Google. So nobody, I'm not saying that
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.800]  browsers aren't important, but the thing that nobody really foresaw was that there would be
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:09.640]  companies like Google and Amazon who'd weren't running any software on your computer and were
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:13.800]  running in the browser. And it didn't matter which browser it was. Google was Google, whether you
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:20.600]  were using IE or Netscape or iCab, it was, you know, you typed G O O and it filled in and you went
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.080]  to Google and that's where you searched for everything. And Amazon was there, you know,
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.720]  Amazon worked in every browser. That was the seat, you know, part of the brilliance of, and again,
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.720]  in hindsight, it seems super obvious, but in the nineties, it didn't seem obvious, at least at a
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:38.840]  certain point until a certain point in the nineties, it didn't seem obvious that the way the next wave
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:46.040]  of big corporations was going to come from service providers that just ran stuff in the cloud that
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:55.240]  you access from any browser. Right. And then when she got to Apple, I think she really missed the
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:48:00.520]  button. I think she picked the right part of the company, which is the app store. I do think that
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:05.480]  if there is an anti-competitive argument to be made against Apple, and I think there is a good
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:11.080]  one, it does involve their administration and control of the app store. All the clearly
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.280]  demonstrable ones are there, you know, the ones that are consumers can feel and see and touch,
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:20.680]  so to speak, but she completely missed the boat on what it is. It's she's, she's back to this.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.400]  You run a product marketplace. You shouldn't be allowed. Apple shouldn't be allowed to,
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:31.320]  to both control the app store and distribute its own apps on the app store, which is dumb. That's
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:35.720]  the dumbest thing is that they should be allowed that. No, it should actually be the way it should
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:39.400]  be done. They should put their ops on the store. Every else's absolute store. People would start
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.720]  what they want. Right. I wouldn't necessarily agree with it, but one argument would be that,
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.360]  yes, they should put more of their apps in the app store as opposed to baking them in like,
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:55.880]  you know, and, and I, I think it's a coincidence. I, that Spotify came out this week with their
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:02.120]  public call for, you know, the government intervention into the app store. But if you look
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.320]  at Warren's proposal, it wouldn't really help Spotify at all. That's the thing is a Spotify
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:12.120]  has come out with this thing now very publicly calling for, you know, that Apple's app store
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:17.480]  isn't fair. And what Warren is promoting, promoting as a remedy wouldn't really help them at all.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:23.720]  I mean, I like it. Yeah, it wouldn't help them at all. What you're saying. And what I'm saying is a
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.080]  possible thing is what if Apple music had to come from the app store instead of being built in and
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:33.480]  not on, not just built into every iOS, but literally it's in one of the foremost prestigious
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:40.040]  spots in the dock. Um, and then, you know, you'd have to download Apple music just the same way
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.200]  you'd have to download Spotify, but that's not really Spotify's problem. Spotify's problem is
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.920]  the 30% that they have to pay for anybody if they were to allow people to sign up within the app
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:57.320]  store, the 30% that's mandatory though, the 30% rate combined with the fact that any in-app
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:05.000]  digital purchase of a subscription or something like that, um, has to use Apple's payment and
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:13.560]  has to pay 30%. And so that's the anti-competitive angle is that, uh, if Spotify wants the argument
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:19.560]  to the contrary, is that people can buy a subscription to Spotify. They just can't do it
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:24.440]  via IAP. Right. You know? Right. And I think that's, you know, that will be Apple's argument.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.920]  And Apple's argument of course, is we built the app store. We maintain the app store. If you want
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:33.480]  to sell things in the app store, you, those are our rules. If you want to sell things outside the
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:38.360]  app store, you can, and they could use those things in the app store. You can, they could
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:45.160]  download the app, but you just can't, the convenience of buying it, the conversion bonus
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.400]  of buying it in the app is something that we're not going to let you use unless you pay us.
[01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:54.920]  And that should be the crux of what Warren should have attacked. And she didn't. Right. And I think
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:58.360]  there's a good argument there. And I think it puts, I think Apple has a defense for it,
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:06.360]  but I think it's, it's sort of a, you know, Apple's biggest defense is Google is Android,
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:11.640]  ironically, right? They're like, you know, they, on one hand, Tim Cook could be like,
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:16.760]  we weighed like billions on the app store, but he can also say, but we're so tiny compared to
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:21.640]  Google. They have all the users, right? And it's like ticking a revenue number and comparing it
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:29.320]  against a user number. And there is some sense of irony in the fact that the government is set up,
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:37.800]  not necessarily to play with those revenue numbers, but to sort of pay attention to and reward or
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:44.040]  whatever you want to call it or punish people based on the peer user base. So if Apple's to
[01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:49.400]  make an argument that Google actually is the one that should be examined or that they are provided,
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:55.320]  they provide them some cover by providing a platform that is widely accessible by a
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:59.880]  major portion of the population. And not only that, but they also apply many of the same rules.
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:04.600]  They have cover there. You know, that is probably their strongest argument.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:11.640]  I just feel like fundamentally though, the whole thing, and I've been on this for a while. Like,
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:17.720]  I just think that today's antitrust law in the US, the EU might be a little better than the
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:23.400]  United States, but I still feel like fundamentally, the whole thing is still rooted in 100 years ago.
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:30.200]  I mean, and Warren even brings up like the, what was she say here? Back when railroads were
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.520]  dominant, there's a quote from her and you had to get steel and wheat onto the railroad. There was
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.480]  a period of time when the railroads figured out that they could make money, not only by selling
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:44.600]  tickets on a railroad, but also by buying the steel company and then cutting the price of
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:49.080]  transporting steel for their own company and raising the price of transporting steel for
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.960]  any competitors. And that's, you know, that is actually something that happened and that
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:53:01.480]  actually informs modern US antitrust law, but that was 100 years ago. And I feel like trying
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:07.240]  to apply that sort of logic to these companies, which are entirely digital and that these
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:14.280]  economies are told these, the way that they work is so different. Is it would be like trying to
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:21.960]  apply 1804 laws to those companies in the early 1900s, right? You know, how in the world would
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:28.680]  the laws of 1800 have foreseen railroads, let alone the steel industry? Yeah, the carriage law
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.760]  is just not going to fly in a digital marketplace or to evaluate one. Right. And my favorite example
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:41.720]  of this in recent law was the Apple eBooks antitrust case, which really, the whole thing
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:49.160]  just hinged on whether prices were going up or down for consumers. And I get lots of pushback
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.800]  on this. I've gotten it over the years by saying that I really think Apple was done wrong here.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:59.320]  And it's always from readers who say, but the prices were higher and I want to pay $9.99 for
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:05.800]  books. But what Amazon was doing wasn't, you know, Amazon's the one who has a dominant position in
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:11.000]  the ebook industry, a monopoly. They're the ones who, if you talk to publishers, who do you, who
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.320]  are you concerned about in the ebook industry? They all sit there. They all say Amazon, not
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:22.840]  Apple. The whole reason they got into bed with Apple and made the deals that ended up causing
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:28.120]  Apple to lose that lawsuit was because the actual book publishers were all concerned about what
[01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:33.560]  Amazon was doing, which was artificially deflating prices to keep competitors out. And even to the
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:39.560]  point of selling bestsellers at a loss, just because they could afford to and others couldn't,
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:49.160]  you know, like Amazon as a company with a huge market cap and a very high stock price and support
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:55.480]  from its shareholders, famously of running as a no profit business, just reinvesting all revenue
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.720]  into the business could afford to sell eBooks cheaper than Barnes and Noble could. Barnes and
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:07.560]  Noble couldn't sell a $15 ebook for $9.99 and take a $5 loss on each one. Amazon could,
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:15.960]  and they did. That's the bullying anti-competitive behavior. And it's all based on the fact that
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.800]  US antitrust law is based on the basic idea that if prices go up for consumers, that's bad. And
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:28.440]  if they don't, that's good, which in theory makes sense. But when you think about a company like
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:34.360]  Amazon that can sell things at a loss when others can't, it doesn't. And again,
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:37.720]  it's all just based on a hundred year old distribution versus creation, too.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:45.560]  There's an argument that falls in. It may be in the short run slightly better for a consumer.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:52.200]  But if there's no profit being made by the people creating the product,
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  you know, then it's now you end up in a position where they get crushed out of business,
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.800]  or they must deal with Amazon, then who has the stronger antitrust argument, you know?
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:08.760]  And, you know, Amazon's basic products, that's not the problem. You know, I mean,
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.760]  Walmart has every major retailer has house brand products.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.240]  Amazon didn't start that.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.480]  You know, and I'm not saying Walmart doesn't do things that
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:22.440]  companies consider bullying from their marketing perspective. They do.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.880]  But it's just not the fundamental problem if you're going to go after Amazon. So I kind of
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:36.360]  feel like this whole thing is a shame, because I do feel like it is good that a major US politician,
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:42.280]  someone like Warren, who right now is perhaps at the height of her influence, because she's
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.040]  already been well known. And now she's announced herself as a candidate for the presidency in 2020.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:51.400]  She has a significant, you know, number of she might not be the front runner,
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:58.760]  but she certainly is in the running. So something that she proposes like this is going to carry a
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:03.720]  lot of weight. And, you know, she winds up not winning. If she ends up not winning the nomination,
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.800]  she may never be quite as influential again. And I kind of feel like so it's good that somebody's
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:15.960]  looking at this stuff, because I do feel like the government, you know, in the US should be looking
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:21.240]  at these companies, all four of them in various ways in ways that they haven't, but I feel like
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:27.720]  man missing the boat at these technical levels is just sort of this. It's very, very disappointing
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:33.800]  to me. Yep, I agree. Anyway, what I didn't look a lot at the Spotify thing. Yeah, what's the gist?
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:39.880]  I know that part of it is the 30%, which I do think is the key thing to it to attack if you're
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:45.000]  Spotify, but I haven't seen the rest of their proposal. Have you? No, I haven't read through
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.360]  it in a detailed way. So I couldn't speak to it as far as what they what they actually want.
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:54.520]  Right. But the main problem isn't the fact that Apple distributes apps through the App Store.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:58:01.000]  It's basically the basically it's the 30% that they want the money, right? Well, and then which,
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.560]  you know, the money is, it's legit. Like, you know, Apple does earn a good chunk of money
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:12.040]  for a product that they don't create. But on the other hand, it's in Spotify is a smaller company
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:18.520]  than Apple. But Spotify is not like, you know, some sort of innocent little two person garage
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:25.880]  startup, like, and in talking about doing things that would be popular or unpopular. I mean,
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:30.200]  Spotify has spent like $100 million recently trying to build a proprietary podcast
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:37.480]  thing to get podcasts on Spotify into a more Netflix like thing where, you know,
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:45.880]  Spotify podcasts are only on Spotify. Whereas Apple, which has which embraced podcasts at an
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:53.880]  extraordinary, really extraordinary early stage of podcasts as a phenomenon, and runs what is still
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:59:02.360]  widely considered the why it is that's the biggest index of podcasts. And the most popular podcast
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:11.000]  player, iTunes and the podcast app on iOS, has kept it entirely open in a way that it's,
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.840]  in my opinion, admirable, they've never made even even a step in the direction of trying to take any
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:27.000]  sort of proprietary control over podcasts or done anything that would put Android or Windows or
[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:33.480]  going back far enough zoom users at a disadvantage trying to listen to podcasts compared to if Apple
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:44.040]  hadn't been involved. Right. And I say never. I say boo his to Spotify's grab for podcasts being a
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:51.080]  proprietary platform. I know. I know. Yeah. Well, look, Spotify is it's a huge company in terms of
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:55.640]  especially in terms of music and how difficult that industry is. Their argument is they could
[01:59:55.640 --> 02:00:03.400]  their argument is they could have been bigger, which is, it's definitely one way to go. But I
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:12.360]  think that they, they have, I think, an opportunity to kind of speak in a populist way. But I think
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:16.280]  that their argument comes off a little bit like, well, we could have made more money, though.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:22.600]  But I don't disagree necessarily with their point. I understand where they're coming from.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:27.320]  I think the way that they're making the point is a little bit, you know, business focused,
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.200]  it should maybe be a little bit more populous, because I think they actually gain more support.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.720]  But, you know, we'll see how it pans out how the message goes across. I think people are starting
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.560]  to get reactions, we're already starting to see some reactions from like lawmakers and,
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:47.560]  and other entrepreneurs and stuff who some of those entrepreneurs feel the same way as Spotify
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:52.920]  and have come under the same sort of thumb, so to speak of Apple's, you know, kind of arrangement
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.040]  where they, you know, it's like, pray that I don't make it harder for you to just do it,
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:04.360]  you know what I mean? I, my argument would be, and that to me, the way it probably should be
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:12.760]  in some sense is that an app, if it wants to institute its own payment processing,
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:19.320]  should be able to. But then you're on your own as the developers, and you do your back end,
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.800]  and you do the front end, and you take the credit, you, you take the credit card numbers,
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:30.760]  that's right, you deal with subscription renewal, and people's, you know, in between subscription
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.680]  renewals, if their credit card number changes, because they, you know, got a new credit card
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:39.800]  or whatever, you deal with all that all these things that that I, you know, Apple's iTunes
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:45.400]  payment thing handles automatically, you do it, and you're on your own. Or, if you want to use
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:51.560]  our thing, which is a very easy API, and puts people one fingerprint or FaceTime scan away
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:57.640]  from approving the purchase, and we handle their subscription renewals, and, you know, and, and we,
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:04.200]  we have our, we put our trust behind it, and people know that they can trust the iTunes for
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:07.400]  this the way they've trusted it for all their other purchases, then you'll pay our 30%.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:14.440]  And see how it goes. And, you know, Ben Thompson has argued pretty strongly,
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:20.040]  I think I agree with him that if Apple were to do that, they would probably have to lower the 30%
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.920]  lower it to where I don't know, but that, you know, in a way that that would be competing
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:30.520]  against letting app developers roll their own, like having Netflix be, you know, letting Netflix
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.720]  sign you up, but not pay Apple any tax by but handling it all on their own, whatever that
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.080]  number would be, would it be 15%? Would it be 10%? I don't know. It would come down to some other
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.800]  number other than 30% due to competition, which is the way it's supposed to work.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:54.280]  That would be my proposal, proposed suggestion to Senator Warren if she's, if she's listening.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.640]  Yeah, I think that's, that's absolutely one way to go. I mean,
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:10.120]  it's having Apple be the, the, the person who controls both of the both the framework by which
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:15.720]  they get sold, and the architecture by which people can enter into continuing financial
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.000]  relationships with people. It definitely is a bad look, right? Like, it's easy to attack.
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:25.640]  Whether that's fair or not, I don't know. But it certainly is easy to say,
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.680]  hey, this is a bad thing. Why? Why does this happen? You know, who should be who could should
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:37.560]  have this much power or whatever. But I think there's definitely a way to look at it where
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:45.160]  you're like, Hey, what if we what if as a company, we decided we just didn't need to make this much
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:52.920]  money off of this particular segment. And what we'll do is look at least appear optically, like
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:57.400]  we are on the side of entrepreneurs and want to make sure that we're not stifling competition or
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.560]  whatever. And they basically don't charge you until you reach a certain size. This wouldn't
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:06.920]  help. Right, right, right. It would absolutely create this feeling of like, hey, we were
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:11.480]  fostering entrepreneurship, and we're welcoming competition and all of this stuff. At a certain
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:16.680]  point, though, once you reach a certain volume or certain intensity of business or whatever,
[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:20.520]  you know, we, you know, it makes sense for us to charge you and who could argue with that,
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:23.800]  right. And I think that's the way they should go with it personally. But yeah,
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:28.920]  what's it called the tax bracket system? Oh, yeah, a tax bracket. Well,
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:34.360]  expert tranches, or, but there's a name for it. And people widely misunderstand it, where
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:45.160]  people think that if the top tax bracket goes to 50%, let's just say, if you make them $10 million
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:53.240]  or more, then there's a tax. The way it actually works is you only pay the 50% rate on the income
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:59.800]  from 10 million and over. That's right. So if you make 10 million and $1, you don't owe 5 million
[02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:04.760]  and 50 cents in taxes, you owe a greater percentage of that $1. Right. But like your
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:10.760]  first 100,000 is the same rate everybody put pays on their first 100,000. You know, and if everybody
[02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:14.680]  there's like the earned income tax credit, so like for everybody, whether you're like a billionaire
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:22.280]  or not, like your first 3020 $30,000, whatever is tax free. That's that would be Yeah, I've seen
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:26.440]  other people propose that for the App Store, where like, if you have a subscription service,
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:33.720]  you maybe pay nothing for the first $100,000. And then you pay 10% on the next 100,000 and 30% on
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:40.520]  everything above that. Something like that. Right. And again, it certainly would create a lot of good
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.080]  well among indie developers and anybody looking to promote startups and stuff like that, where you
[02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:51.480]  can at least get off the ground and keep 100% or you know, maybe minus maybe they would, you know,
[02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:55.640]  minus the credit card fees. So maybe like the initial rate for the first 100,000 would be like
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:06:00.920]  2.5% or something like that. Sure, some reasonable number to cover Apple's credit card processing
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:08.760]  fees combined with their fraud and etc. Yeah. And I mean, in like, that would even sound even like
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:16.280]  the those two options have to exist in mutually exclusive ways, you could do both, you could do a,
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.240]  you know, a scale that says like, hey, you know, for your first bit, this is not that much. And
[02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:27.960]  then later on, you could do a sliding scale where you're like, you know, a it's x percent, if you do
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:32.840]  this much business, and it's less or more if you do more, you know, I don't know, there are a lot
[02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:41.000]  of options in between, they can't charge and they charge 30%. Yeah, yeah. But that's, you know,
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.040]  it just is very frustrating that that that's not what the finger has been put on, you know.
[02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:53.720]  Alright, last but not least, let's, before we start the last segment, let's talk about our
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:58.120]  third and final sponsor of the day. This is one of my favorite companies that sponsors the show
[02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:04.680]  Mac Weldon. Mac Weldon's mission is simple, they make all your basics. This is stuff like t shirts,
[02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.560]  underwear, socks, they make them smartly designed, they make them nice to look at,
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:15.640]  they make them comfortable, they make them easy to buy, and convenient to buy. They wanted more
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.800]  out of their basics, and they always questioned how something so essential could be such a pain
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:27.000]  in, well, let's just say the butt to buy. Their eureka moment happened when they were in a
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.560]  department store aisle full of brands that dominated their top drawer and surrounded by
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:35.720]  a mind numbing assortment of underwear and socks, they realized consistent fit and quality had
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:40.200]  become a game of roulette. Are you really getting stuff that's the best fitting, best most
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:44.760]  comfortable? Or are you just buying a name brand that you knew? They started from scratch. They
[02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:49.800]  even engineered their own fabric. They made sure the design process was meticulous, so you can
[02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:58.040]  count on the fit being the same each time. So if you get a pair of Mac Weldon, let's say t shirts,
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.760]  and it fits great, you buy some more, all the ones you buy, they're all going to fit the same way.
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:08.200]  Meticulous about it. It's really a better product, almost certainly better than what you're wearing
[02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:13.080]  right now if you're not wearing Mac Weldon. It's a premium men's essentials brand that believes in
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:19.240]  smart design and premium fabrics. I've got a whole bunch of their stuff. I love it. It's always the
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:25.000]  first stuff out of the drawer when I'm putting stuff on. I really like in particular, I love
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:31.960]  their socks. They have terrific socks, very comfortable. Long lasting to a lot longer
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.160]  lasting than a lot of other stuff that I've had. Very comfortable and very stylish. To be honest,
[02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:42.120]  they're very fun to buy. I've really gotten into in the last couple of years I used for years,
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:48.360]  I would say for like 40 some years of my life. I think every single pair of socks I owned was
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:53.400]  either white, which was like 90% of my life, or black, which was anytime where I felt like
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:58.440]  white socks weren't dressy enough. Now I've got all sorts of colorful socks. And I feel like it's
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:06.200]  start your day on a brighter note. So not only do their stuff look good, feel good, perform well,
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:11.160]  last long, but they have great prices too. And it's really easy to shop for this stuff.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:17.000]  I've got everything. I've got the t shirts. I've got their underwear. I've got the socks.
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.760]  You know what I like? I'll tell you what else I like my favorite product in them. I like a v neck
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:25.080]  t shirt because then you can unbutton a button and you don't see the t shirt underneath. I feel
[02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:28.280]  like if you're going to wear an undershirt, they should all be v necks. I'm not quite sure why
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:34.040]  anybody doesn't buy v necks, but all of my undershirts are Mack Weldon. They all do fit
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.600]  the same. I've just got like a whole drawer full of identical Mack Weldon white t shirts,
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:45.560]  v neck, and I love them. Here's the call to action. You get 20% off your first order by

[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:33.720]  go. You lucky son of a bitch. I think anybody who listens to this show for a long time knows one of
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:39.720]  my obsessions is star Wars. And I think most of you also know I'm a big fan of Disney theme parks,
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:45.400]  uh, or at least the Florida ones. Um, not that I'm not a fan of the other ones, but I've never been
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:51.480]  to any of the other ones. Um, but my family loves going to the Disney, uh, Orlando area theme parks
[02:10:53.080 --> 02:11:00.760]  and anybody who follows either of those obsessions knows that Disney is on the cusp of opening major
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:07.240]  new, uh, theme park lands in both California and Florida for star Wars. And you, you lucky son of
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:16.600]  a bit spent three days with them. I did. I did. It was, uh, it was interesting. Um, it was sort
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:23.880]  of just like a, a three day, like mouth agape situation. So this was all in California cause
[02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:29.400]  the California one is a going to open first and B is where Imagineering headquarters is.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:35.480]  Yes. So the way Imagineering works is they had their headquarters are in Glendale,
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:40.680]  um, kind of in a business park. They're fairly unassuming group of page buildings. Um, and then
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.240]  they have facilities in Florida that are largely about maintenance and storage. Um, but then they
[02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:49.800]  also have some research institutes like in Pittsburgh and a couple of other places, but
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:55.640]  their headquarters are there. So it was sort of a three day jaunt through the process. This is by
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:03.560]  the way, very unusual for Disney. They typically do not do large press kind of, you know, pushes
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:11.800]  with this stuff or lengthy explanations of kind of what they're doing. Um, and you know, I sort of,
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:15.880]  it was revelatory for a lot of people that had been there or that had been covering for the
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:18.840]  company for a long time. Some of them, you know, were there on this little press tour.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:27.800]  Um, I was, there's the, um, Jermaine over at Gizmodo was on this thing. Um, but he was,
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:31.320]  he's sort of their entertainment writer. Um, you know, the kind of movies and entertainment,
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:36.680]  things like that is a good writer. I like reading him. But outside of that, there was almost no
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.600]  tech press. And the only reason that I was even involved with this because they, it was, you know,
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:49.800]  it's Hollywood reporter, LA times, um, variety, you know, variety. Exactly. Uh, several, several
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.600]  theme park, you know, kind of oriented writers from like travel and leisure and things like that.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:59.880]  Right. This is the, this is the sort of people that were on this tour. And the only reason I
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:05.880]  was even involved is because I do have a personal fascination with. Imagineering, um, how they kind
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:11.160]  of operate, you know, functionally as well as of course what they do, you know, in the, the sort of
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:17.720]  business of building themed entertainment and robotics and, um, you know, kind of, uh,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:22.200]  interactive experiences and world building and, you know, all of that stuff. Right. It's just
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:29.080]  interesting to me. And there's a lot of tech in that that is used in that, um, industry and even
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.760]  created for that industry that it's just not talked about because they don't talk to the people
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:39.480]  who care or would understand it or would, you know, care to interpret it for an audience or
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:45.160]  whatever. So I've spent about three years sort of getting to know those folks over there and
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:50.360]  convincing them that there are stories that they were not telling that needed to be told or needed
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.480]  to be examined. Um, basically pitching them on this idea that, look, you're doing a lot of stuff
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:14:02.840]  in this arena, but you're not telling people about it. And my major pitch is you need to hire
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.280]  roboticists and engineers, software engineers and, you know, coders and all these people,
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:13.000]  but they don't know that you have hard problems to solve. And there's only, there's no catnip greater
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:19.480]  to an engineer than a hard problem. So it is a, that was basically my, my crowbar that I used to
[02:14:19.480 --> 02:14:23.320]  kind of push at this. And that's how I ended up getting the invite. Basically it was, they were
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:27.800]  like, Oh yeah, you know, we were going to do this thing. We'd love to have you involved in all this
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:32.280]  stuff. Everybody else there was from the entertainment world. So it was kind of fun being
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:37.560]  the only person there who's like, okay, yeah, cool. Could you explain now that, you know, this cat,
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:41.800]  this tool that you use, why didn't you just use CAD? Why did you use this, you know, in-house tool
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:46.360]  and all of this stuff? So what did you, what did you do with Nvidia to get GPU's to be able to
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:52.200]  drive this display? Yeah, basically there was a lot of, I mean, I think, you know, not, not to,
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:57.240]  not to telegraph too much, but, or, or put too much words in anybody's mouth, but there was a
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:04.200]  lot of side eyeing from the engineers who obviously wanted to talk about it to the PR people. Like,
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:09.800]  can we please, can I talk about this? Cause I've been living this for, for two years, you know,
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.160]  normally they don't let them talk about some of that stuff or they're not used to being asked
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:18.680]  about it at the very least. So that was fun. But yeah, the gist of it was to, to step back.
[02:15:18.680 --> 02:15:24.600]  It was a three day tour. We started out at Imagineering, or excuse me, at ILM in San
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:29.640]  Francisco. Most, I don't know if a lot of people know this, but they're, their main headquarters
[02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:34.760]  are, aside from Skywalker Ranch, which is, you know, a different facility that does a lot of
[02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:40.360]  audio and stuff. ILM's main headquarters are in San Francisco on the Presidio. They have a
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:45.800]  facility there that they share with Lucasfilm. So we started out at essentially Lucasfilm,
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:51.800]  which is a sort of the bottom floor, talking about the originations of the, of the project
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:56.760]  and the storytelling and kind of how do you start building this world and all the decisions there.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:04.440]  And then we moved to Imagineering in Glendale on the second day. And that Imagineering is,
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:08.200]  you know, obviously where they build a lot of the animatronics. They have a workshop there
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:12.440]  where they craft a lot of the in-house stuff that they do. They have contractors too, but a lot of
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:20.040]  the main, you know, key ones are done in-house. And then on the third day, we actually went and
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:27.000]  did a site tour at Galaxy's Edge, which is the land that they're building onto Disneyland.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:27.800]  Where is Glendale?
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:35.800]  The Star Wars land. Glendale is just north of the, this sort of hills, the Hollywood Hills.
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:43.000]  Basically, you've got Glendale, the hills, downtown LA, LA proper, Venice, all of that.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.920]  And then south of that is Anaheim where Disneyland is. So it's just north of LA,
[02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:48.520]  essentially. It's still LA.
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.600]  Did you guys fly between days one and two? I mean, that's a long way because ILM is,
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:57.320]  is San Francisco. And then the other two days are down in, in Southern California.
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:01.560]  Yeah. Yeah. We flew. I book all my own travel when I go on these things. Like I don't,
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:06.040]  I don't let junkets pay for me. Um, I'm kind of a policy of ours. We just don't,
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:09.400]  don't really do it every once in a while. There's some weird thing where it's like,
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:12.760]  Hey, this is our thing. And you know, just come. Right. And it's like, okay,
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:18.040]  we'll disclose it. But by and large, we pay for our own travel. So when we flew between the two,
[02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:23.240]  just speaking, this is just a fun side note as an aviation nerd, but, um, flying between the two,
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:29.960]  we flew for out of Oakland. Um, so we drove, took a little bus from, um,
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:35.560]  Imagineering to, or excuse me, from Lucasfilm to, uh, to the Oakland airport. And I fly out
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:41.960]  of Oakland, but not regularly. Uh, I usually fly out of SFO or LAX depending on where I'm going.
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:47.880]  Uh, if I'm not playing at a Fresno and Fresno doesn't have a lot of direct flights, um,
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:54.920]  to Oakland or a lot of direct flights to, um, definitely no direct flights to, uh,
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:18:01.560]  John Wayne, um, which is in Anaheim or the Burbank airport, which is the one that's closest to
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:08.360]  Glendale. But if you fly out of Oakland, you can get a jet blue flight, uh, out of Oakland to
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:15.160]  Glendale. And it's, depending on the day, it can be as little as 70 bucks to fly, which is great.
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:19.160]  And that's what it was. So my airfare was full disclosure. My airfare was $70.
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:23.160]  I think that's what I swear to God. I think that's what I paid for an Uber to get from SFO
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.400]  to San Jose last year. Exactly. And the cool, here's the cool, really cool thing about it.
[02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:37.560]  Jet blue because of, you know, carriage deals, right. Um, carriage deals in air, in airlines.
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:41.480]  Most people have experienced this at some point you booked through United, but you're actually
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.560]  flying on, you know, some other carrier or you booked through American, but you're on American
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.440]  Eagle and whatever. It was a carriage deal. It's basically like, Hey, we know we're not going to be
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:55.560]  able to fill these flights. So we, we, we're going to give you the seats to sell too. And we get a
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:59.800]  percentage or whatever. And so you basically are flying on some airline that you didn't actually
[02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.680]  book. Um, the majors don't cross over, but a lot of minor carriers crossover with the majors.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:13.640]  So jet blue has a carriage deal with, uh, jet suite, which is like one of these, uh, private
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:20.440]  jet sort of group deal things. I think that's the one that Berkshire Hathaway I think has a
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.640]  investment in, or if not Berkshire Hathaway has an investment in one of them.
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:27.800]  Yeah, exactly. There's like NetJets, JetSuite. There's a bunch of them. Right.
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:32.520]  Yeah. Um, so anyhow, long story short, I flew private for $70.
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:39.800]  Was it nice? It was fun. I mean, you know, it was, Hey, you have your own flight attendant.
[02:19:39.800 --> 02:19:45.960]  It's only, you know, 20 people on the plane. It's very nice. Um, you know, it's definitely not all,
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.880]  uh, you know, broken down and burnt out and everything. It was certainly a short flight,
[02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:57.160]  but it was pleasant. Um, and it was 70 bucks. So can't beat that. And the best part of it,
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:00.760]  this is the absolute best part. The plane is whatever it's nice, you know, but it's a short
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:07.800]  flight. The best part is that they have their own terminal. So instead of going into the airport,
[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:12.600]  you actually go through the regular airport lane and then sort of circle around and their terminal
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:19.800]  is just directly adjacent to the airport. Basically. Um, they come in, you come in, you,
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:26.520]  uh, drive right up to the terminal, essentially, um, hop out, hop into the little waiting room
[02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:32.120]  there. You talk to the person at the desk, you're checked in, in like 25 seconds. Um, you sit and
[02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:36.760]  have some snacks and some coffee and whatever that they have out there and you get on your plane.
[02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:41.000]  And then when you land on the other side, you literally just pull up to a hanger and get out
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.280]  and go into the, go into the hanger, walk into through the hanger and then exit the hanger after
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:52.600]  a little waiting room and, and get in your cab or car and boom, you're gone. So it's nice. I think
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:21:00.600]  I might get rich now that I know this is how they might try that for a while. Um, it was cool.
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:07.080]  Trenton Larkin So one day at ILM, one day at Imagineering, one day at the actual park,
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:15.720]  which is set to open when? So the opening date is May 31st is for Disneyland. And then there's
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:20.200]  another date for Walt Disney World. I don't have it in my brain, but it's later on in the year.
[02:21:20.200 --> 02:21:28.520]  Trenton Larkin I think it's September. Uh, well, let's call it September. Uh, I wonder how badly
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:35.240]  they had hoped to hit the, uh, the May the 4th. There's always a big thing now that Disney's
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:41.400]  actually had deals with Lucasfilm for a very long time. There's been the Star Tours ride
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:48.680]  since I think the eighties, uh, August 29th. Sorry. Just want to end. Yeah. But yeah. And
[02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:54.280]  so they have deals for a while. They've long had like Star Wars celebrations on May the 4th,
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:22:00.280]  because it's get it. May the 4th be with you. Uh, I'm sure they tried to hit that, but
[02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:07.960]  it's coming up. So it must be, and you know what, to be honest, so the, the opening date is to
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:13.960]  finish up the opening day conversation. The opening date is May 31st and not a, both attractions will
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:19.160]  not be open on that. And there's two, two main attractions and both attractions will not be open
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:23.480]  on that date. So they're pushing hard. I mean, they were working around the clock when we were
[02:22:23.480 --> 02:22:29.880]  there. Um, one of the, one of the tour folks were telling me, uh, one of the construction managers
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:36.760]  was telling us that he left one night at like 5 PM, 6 PM. And they got in the next morning at 8 AM
[02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:40.120]  and like a bunch of X-wings had appeared. So they're working, they're working around the
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:44.760]  clock pretty much. The two places where I've noticed where construction moves really fast
[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:50.840]  is Disney, uh, where you can take like a week long vacation and see progress having been made
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:56.440]  on something that's under a crane. Um, and Vegas where stuff goes up in Vegas and it's like,
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:01.800]  who knows how the hell they make it happen, but it's, it, it happens seemingly, at least to my
[02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:09.560]  perspective, happens pretty fast. Um, money. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It's poor enough money on it.
[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:15.560]  Well, and maybe there's less regular, maybe less traditional union hurdles than in like
[02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:19.880]  big East coast cities like Philly and New York, you know, there's, there's more red tape,
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:23.720]  more red tape or something like that. Like I feel like down in Orlando, Disney,
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:28.440]  not that they're cutting corners, but that they're, you know, there's just not as much
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:35.640]  urban bureaucracy, you know, and I think Vegas is sort of, sort of more of a similar, you know,
[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:43.160]  money talks sort of thing, but anyway, it can happen fast. Um, just going meta for a second.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:50.040]  I do suspect, I suspect, I know there's a big overlap between Apple nerds and Disney nerds
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:56.520]  or fans, whatever you want to call it. But, and, and I also think though, that there's probably
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.680]  a lot of people who listen to the show who are, who maybe are surprised that I'm a big fan of
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:06.520]  the Disney theme parks. Cause maybe I come across as being a gruff curmudgeon who would think of
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:13.160]  standing all line out in this all day out in the sun, going around on a sensible kitty rides.
[02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:21.000]  It wouldn't be my bag. Um, and I'll just say it's, it's hard to explain, but I would just say that,
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.560]  that the difference, if you've never, I think you've had to have been to one of their parks
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:29.880]  to get it. Um, and maybe you have been and you don't like it, you know, I can certainly imagine
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.440]  if you really just can't stand being in lines, you're never going to like it no matter how,
[02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:41.800]  you know, how much you would ask otherwise. Uh, I just appreciate it as, as an appreciator of good
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:46.760]  design in general, or at least thoughtful design, because it's incredible. The, the, the depth to
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:52.760]  with which they design things is just astounding to me. And that's the main reason that I'm a fan
[02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:59.480]  of stuff like this. Yeah. I think, I think there's a lot of aspects to it. Uh, design is absolutely
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:07.480]  one major one for me. Um, you know, the technology that they are using more and more is sharing a lot
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:13.800]  of edges with, you know, the bleeding edge of, of what, you know, is out there in terms of robotics.
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:18.360]  Um, one of the big traffic, but things that I've been kind of tracking for a long time,
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:24.120]  one of the big, uh, sort of, I don't know if you'd call it a trend, but, um, topics is, uh, the,
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:30.440]  the arena of HRI or human robot interaction, because I do feel that HRI is going to become
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:38.120]  sort of, uh, essential learnings or a central investment for any major company, uh, that has
[02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:45.160]  any sort of automated or roboticized features or processes. Um, because it's already, I mean,
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:51.480]  in practical terms, just to give people like a grounding HRI is used in the field of, of
[02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:58.680]  industrial robotics, uh, to give people greater awareness of their robot coworkers, so to speak,
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:03.720]  uh, that greater awareness comes with viewing that robot as an entity. Like if you think of
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:08.920]  it as a personality or a thing that has a, you know, a bit of a personality or whatever,
[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:13.160]  you're more aware of it. And so you're safer, you know, if the robot arm is moving around in
[02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:19.000]  your workspace, you're more aware of it. If you think of it as a, you know, a being an entity or
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:25.160]  whatever you want to call it, um, it's kind of a weird kind of hippie dippie, uh, uh, discipline
[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:29.800]  in some ways, there's a lot of, you know, Berkeley professors thinking hard about it and stuff like
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:37.160]  that, but it is absolutely clear that Disney is one of the foremost world leaders in HRI
[02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:41.560]  because of the way their learnings over decades of the way people interact with creatures and
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.560]  characters, uh, the way they interact and view animatronics, the way that they, you know, kind
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:51.320]  of partake in themed entertainment and that kind of thing. So they're doing some fascinating stuff
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:56.120]  there. And then on top of that, you have this layer of world building, uh, that design that
[02:26:56.120 --> 02:26:59.880]  you were talking about, you know, where you're, you're able to be ensconced in a, in a thing
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:05.880]  that's trans, you know, transports you. And the detail, the attention to detail is absolutely
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:11.480]  fascinating and enjoyable. I mean, if you want to understand the level of detail that
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.680]  Disney engineers put into things or these imagineers put into things, you just look at the
[02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:21.640]  next time you're at Disneyland or, or Disney world, look at the railings, right? Just, you know,
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.360]  look at the different railings they have throughout the park and the way they transition
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.000]  from one land to another and kind of easy you into this place that you're, you know, you're
[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:33.080]  leaving one place and entering another and that kind of thing. So this just, it's just cool stuff
[02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:38.840]  like that that I love. Um, I always like to say, I've used this at least some point on the show,
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:43.560]  but I always like to say that I, so I first went to Disney world in Florida, like about 12 years
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:49.880]  ago. Um, uh, and before I went, I was kind of looking forward to it, but I'd never been as a
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:54.200]  kid. My family never went to Disney world when I was a kid and I didn't go as an adult until our
[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:59.880]  son was like two and a half or three or something like that. Um, I was looking forward to it. Uh,
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:04.120]  I had been in Florida before, but we went to, and this is like in my twenties or something,
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:07.960]  but we went to universal instead cause it seemed like more action packed. I think it was in the
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:12.280]  impact. I think it was probably the right thing to do cause I was still at an age where I didn't
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:19.640]  feel too old to go on the fastest roller coasters known to man. Um, the thing is, is that I, until
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.720]  I went to Disney world, I thought the words amusement park and theme park were completely
[02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:28.920]  interchangeable, you know, like, like street and Avenue or something like that. Whereas when I
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:33.960]  went to Disney world, I finally got it. I was like, Oh, I get what you mean by theme park.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:41.320]  You know, like when you go into, uh, tomorrow land, you don't see any of the rest of the park.
[02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:45.480]  It's like, you're just entirely there, you know, and, and you use the words multiple times in this
[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:51.840]  article on the, the galaxy's edge, the star Wars world controlling the sight lines. Um,
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:58.840]  and it works both ways. And it seems like one of the newer trends is controlling the site ways,
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:02.840]  the sight lines, both ways where the big thing is like, once you're in the galaxy's edge,
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.200]  you're not supposed to see the red. You don't see Cinderella's castle or right. Um, uh, well,
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:14.280]  I guess that's actually wrong in California. It's, uh, uh, not Cinderella's castle. It's
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:17.400]  sleeping beauty's castle. That's how much of a Disney nerd I am. How about that?
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:25.320]  But we would have had angry emails, but that the, the entrance is controlled as well,
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:31.480]  right? Like at least in Florida, like as you're walking into, uh, tomorrow land,
[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:34.840]  you see tomorrow land, it's almost like beckoning to you to walk this way.
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:39.000]  Whereas it sounds to me like the galaxy's edge thing. It's sort of like,
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:43.640]  you don't see anything and then you come through an entrance and it's boom, a big reveal.
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:49.800]  Yeah. One of the, one of the things they talked about a lot was how to get people from there to
[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:55.480]  here. Like w you know, you're, you're transporting these people from one world to another and they're
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:59.560]  guests on this planet, which is also, they say how they'll explain the fact that you're wearing
[02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:08.920]  Crocs, right? But the, the basic thesis is like, Hey, we're going to create this feeling of
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:15.000]  compression. So you compress people down to a finite space and then expansion where you,
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:20.280]  you open the world back up to them. And so two of the entrances are essentially rock tunnels
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:24.200]  that are made to look like they've been laser cut into the rock, you know, by like the,
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:33.960]  uh, empire or, or excuse me, the, the first order or the, um, resistance, you know, and that those
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:39.480]  rock car or laser carved rock tunnels kind of compress down and bring you down to where you're
[02:30:39.480 --> 02:30:46.120]  going through a tunnel. And then you have, you open up on a Vista, which is like a frame of film
[02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:51.160]  in, in these frames of film or open up like, Oh yeah, this is the first time you saw X, Y,
[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:57.640]  or Z in the films. That's what we want it to feel like. Right. And then, um, in the, the top most
[02:30:57.640 --> 02:31:02.600]  entrance, which comes in from a critter country, which is over near kind of splash mountain in
[02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:07.080]  Disneyland. Um, at least in the, in Disneyland, of course, in Disney world, there's only two
[02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:14.360]  entrances, but it is sort of wooded pathway, you know, that kind of meanders from one wooded
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:19.400]  country to a different kind of trees. And all of a sudden you're, you're in this, uh, resistance
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:25.160]  encampment outside of town, so to speak. So it's that those areas of transition that they create.
[02:31:25.160 --> 02:31:31.640]  Yeah. And they've always, that is again, as a, an appreciator of the, the experience design,
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:36.120]  they've done that with the transitions between the worlds in the, in the parks, at least the
[02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:42.440]  better parks, you know, and the better transitions. Like they even do things like, uh, as you're going
[02:31:42.440 --> 02:31:47.000]  from one to another and there's ambient music, music playing, the speakers are synced up between
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:50.840]  the two so that when you're in the part where you'd hear them both, it, it doesn't sound
[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:54.760]  discordant. They kind of go together. And then you're all of a sudden it's like, it's just like
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:32:01.400]  this weird, smooth transition where you're like, uh, Disney, where you can go from frontier land to,
[02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:09.000]  uh, the Liberty, uh, square world. And you're transferring from the wild west to sort of like,
[02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:14.440]  you know, this sort of, it's mostly Philadelphia, but sort of like a cross between, uh,
[02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:19.960]  revolutionary war, Philadelphia and Boston. Um, but you never hear a transition in the music.
[02:32:19.960 --> 02:32:25.160]  It just sort of works, you know? Yep, exactly. And that, that sort of, uh,
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:33.320]  uh, unknown or, or gentle, unseen transitional thing is what they specialize in. And that stuff
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:38.920]  takes work. I mean, it takes an enormous amount of, uh, thought about, you know, where to put
[02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:43.640]  speakers and they invented new technology to interleave the sound and all of that stuff.
[02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:49.320]  But they're taking basically, you know, a hundred years worth of work in this regard
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:55.000]  and putting it towards kind of making star Wars, uh, physical, which is a very,
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.520]  very interesting undertaking because it's such a well-known. Thing, you know, people have been
[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.760]  seeing it for decades now. And so they know what it's supposed to look like and what it's supposed
[02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:09.240]  to feel like. That's a lot of responsibility. So one of the things that they've done is they made
[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:12.520]  the choice and you even had quotes from somebody talking about it, where they were like, well,
[02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:17.800]  what are we going to do? Are we going to pick one of the known planets like Tatooine or
[02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:23.240]  Hoth or, you know, cloud city or something like that, or we just, you know, go with something
[02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:30.760]  new and they went with something new. Uh, Batuu, is that how you pronounce it? Yeah. B-A-T-U-U.
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:38.040]  Which I think was the right decision. Um, just so that they had the freedom to, you know,
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:43.880]  just, you know, so that people wouldn't be, uh, to continue to on Tatooine's entrance is actually
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:48.360]  on the left, you know, that they had the freedom to design everything the way they want and they're
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:54.760]  not really withholding to any one thing. Yeah. One of the other things I think I put this in
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:58.680]  there, but one of the other things that they mentioned about why they chose to do that is
[02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:04.120]  they wanted people to come in on a, on an even footing. Like if you know, star Wars to a casual
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:11.640]  degree or just barely from, you know, whatever absorbed media you you've seen of it, you should
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:16.440]  still have a good time there. So it shouldn't be like a, you need to know all of the lore of this
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:22.840]  place before you can enjoy it or understand it. And instead it should be welcoming to all. Like
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:28.280]  they're all, we're all starting our adventure together. Like on day one, when everybody walks
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:32.520]  in, they're all on the same footing. They know just as much about this place and about what's
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:37.960]  going to happen here as anybody else, you know? And that's, that is hard to do with an existing
[02:34:37.960 --> 02:34:42.840]  location that, you know, somebody who's a more hardcore fan may just know everything there is
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:48.680]  to know about. Yeah. And that is sort of, um, I think it's the nature of the beast where star
[02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:56.040]  Wars is by the nature of the franchise as sort of, it's been implied since the very first movie in
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:03.480]  1977, that it's a huge galaxy with a gazillion planets and different life forms. And you know,
[02:35:03.480 --> 02:35:07.800]  however, many of the various aliens we saw in the cantina in the first star Wars movie,
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.720]  it was implied that, you know, it's the tip of the iceberg in this galaxy,
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:20.760]  compare and contrast with universal, which has the Harry Potter franchise and has two in Florida.
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:27.720]  They've got the first one they opened at the one park was the Hogwarts area, which in my
[02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:33.800]  opinion, isn't that great? It's not a great entrance. It's like the Hogwarts itself looks
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:40.440]  good from certain angles and looks really flat from other angles. And they built it so that it's
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:44.520]  like a beacon because people are not, I mean, it's like the greatest, I don't know how much universal
[02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:48.760]  spent to get the rights to that, but it was great for them because when you go there, half the kids
[02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.840]  are wearing like Harry Potter robes and stuff. I mean, that's why people are going there.
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:58.600]  So they built it, you can see it from anywhere in the park because they, you know, they know that
[02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:02.360]  that's what people are coming there to see, you know, people come in and they put it like in the
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:07.880]  back corner. But it's just not a great entrance. But the second one they opened at Universal
[02:36:07.880 --> 02:36:16.680]  Studios is Diagon Alley, which has a terrific reveal. It is amazing. Like you're outside,
[02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:20.440]  like across from all this other stuff that everybody knows from Universal Studios,
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:25.160]  and they've just built this lot that are this street that looks like current day London.
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.560]  Very well done. And you're honestly, and there's almost not enough signage. It's almost like we
[02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:36.760]  were like, what the hell is, where's the Harry Potter stuff? I get it that London is England.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:41.960]  And it's like, is this it? And then you go through a little thing that you don't, you know,
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:44.760]  you're like, I think we go through here and you see some, it doesn't, never seems like there's
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:48.760]  a hundreds of people coming in around seems like just, you know, six people going walking through
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:55.720]  like around the corner, you go around a corner, and boom, you're in Diagon Alley. And, you know,
[02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:01.240]  it's a very specific place from the Harry Potter franchise. And just a different way of doing it
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:09.080]  would be like if Star Wars really was tattooing and the surrounding area around the cantina or
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:14.360]  something like that. But on the other hand, that would be so limiting because most of the Star Wars
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:18.760]  worlds, there's really not that much there, right? Like most of them are, most of the planets we have
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:24.600]  seen in the movies are rather desolate, right? They are, you know, and even like, even if you
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.400]  go tattooing, you know, well, that's a freaking desert with like one tiny little city, you know?
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:36.120]  Right. And all we really know about it is there's like a bar and there's a place to buy like
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:41.480]  spaceship parts. Yeah. And not only that, but it's like, literally all it's known for is being crap.
[02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:48.200]  Right. Like Luke wants to leave. Everybody refers to it as a terrible place. You don't want to go
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:54.600]  to a place that's known for being awful. Go have lunch at Jabba's Palace. Right. Right. Exactly.
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:00.440]  And that's where you end up. You end up having to take really well-known places and thematize them,
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:06.840]  which is sort of anti this modern philosophy that Disney has about these parks is that instead you
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:11.560]  should create this thing where you are really building a world and you're not just sort of like
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:17.960]  taking a theme and slapping it on something. Now I will say that this project is a marquee project
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:23.000]  and has all the best people working on it. And they, this philosophy is very like well applied
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:28.120]  here. There's plenty of examples throughout the parks and projects that diehard Disney followers
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:33.480]  will be like, yeah, but they still chintz out on X, Y, or Z. Right. But in terms of this project,
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:39.240]  no expense spared. They're really going for it. And I think it's no better a property to do it
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:46.280]  with in Star Wars. Yeah. The other thing too is that they didn't waste time when they, like
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:50.760]  they've always, at least in Florida at the Hollywood Studios Park, they've had the Star
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:55.080]  Tours ride for, you know, I think since like the late eighties, at least the early nineties,
[02:38:55.960 --> 02:39:02.040]  did a somewhat major upgrade a couple of years back where they didn't really change the ride
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:10.920]  mechanics but totally upgraded the actual movie that you see in the thing. And much for the
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:19.800]  better. It's a much better ride. And then they added some Star Wars stuff while they're building
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:25.880]  this land in an area of the park. It's like right next to the Little Mermaid. So it really,
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:32.440]  it's, it's not land themed at all, but I think that it's like two extremes. It's like, what's
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:37.240]  the, what's the fastest thing we can do to just keep some Star Wars going in this park.
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:44.360]  And, you know, truth be told, the one thing that I think is very different about the,
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:50.200]  what they're doing at Disneyland with the Galaxy's Edge in California and what they're doing at the
[02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:57.960]  Hollywood Studios in Florida is effectively they shut down half of the park in Hollywood Studios.
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:03.960]  Like I, I think anybody who knows how much of the park has been shut down for the last few years,
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:08.600]  if you were going there and you only had time to go to three of the four parks, the Magic Kingdom,
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:13.880]  Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and studios, studios for the last few years should be the last one you
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:21.160]  went to because it really was half shut down because they're, they closed a whole bunch of
[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:25.240]  the major attractions to have this room to build this. Whereas, you know, Disneyland is still
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:33.400]  Disneyland. Right. But, you know, so they added a whole bunch of Star Wars stuff in Hollywood
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:40.360]  Studios in the meantime, in a totally unthemed area, sort of like the generic middle of the
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.640]  park area, you know, and they have like stage shows and every, like maybe two hours, there's
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:55.400]  like a, a stormtrooper parade led by Captain Phasma. And they have some stage, you know,
[02:40:55.400 --> 02:41:01.240]  again, like a cheese ball stage where they actually, you know, Boba Fett on stage,
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:09.480]  which kind of makes me cringe. But then there is cool stuff and I can't help but imagine it's all
[02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:14.040]  a dry run for this experience. And it's really going to be cool because they, they've been doing
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:20.040]  things where they'll just have two stormtroopers or first order stormtroopers walking on parole,
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:27.080]  just to two guys in real first order stormtrooper costumes, walking, you know, side by side,
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:31.800]  and then they'll just come up to people in the park. And like the one time I was holding a beer
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:35.400]  and, and the guy just looked at me pointed at my beer and he just said, watch it.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:42.360]  They just come up and interact with people and like come up to like little kids and say like,
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:46.680]  do you have ID show us identification. And they just want to see one of the
[02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:51.080]  interactions the troopers will do is that they will abduct you or arrest you, so to speak,
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:57.880]  not abduct, abducting any children, but they'll arrest you, especially if you got like a kid,
[02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:02.440]  like they'll arrest your kid and they'll take them over to the side and then they'll act like
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.760]  they're getting a call from a superior or, you know, whatever they're like, Oh, we're okay,
[02:42:06.760 --> 02:42:11.640]  well, you checked out, you know, you're okay, you can move along or whatever, right. But they do all
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:16.520]  of that. I mean, you know, the folks that do it well, and that have fun with it, the cast members
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:22.840]  that do it well, they really use the most, they get the most out of their tools. So the tools that
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:30.200]  they give them are essentially, you know, switches inside the costume with like pre pre recorded
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:35.560]  voices, they don't actually talk. And so that the cast members that utilize those the best and
[02:42:35.560 --> 02:42:40.920]  really have fun with it. They do have they get give great guest experiences, you know, my kid
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:46.680]  got arrested, and she loved it. It was just like a highlight for her, you know, they detained her
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:51.640]  and took a picture and all this stuff. Well, that's the other thing and like to answer my
[02:42:51.640 --> 02:42:55.720]  question from before is why do I John Gruber enjoy it so much part of it, I just enjoy the
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:59.720]  experience I do I just it's a fun place to be let yourself go. You have fun with your kid,
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:03.880]  you buy some popcorn and stuff. But I also there's a part of my brain that is constant,
[02:43:03.880 --> 02:43:07.000]  it's like going to when I go to see Penn and Teller or some other magician, and I'm thinking
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:10.680]  how the hell did they do that? And I figured out like with the stormtroopers, the buttons are on
[02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:14.680]  their blasters, so they can hold the blasters not like they're pointing it at you, but that they
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:19.240]  hold them, you know, to the side, but the the buttons are on the blasters. And they it's just
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:22.920]  like a little mini keyboard where they can push them and then the pre recorded voices come out of
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:28.680]  their helmet. But like you said, the ones who were good at it, it is amazing. Yeah, it almost sounds
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:33.080]  like they, you know, they recorded it just for you, you know, right. I can't, you know, I think
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:37.800]  there's a lot of that to come. They didn't show us everything. That was one of the cool things that
[02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:42.280]  it's still, it's still gonna feel like a surprise to me in a lot of ways, you know, when I go even
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:47.080]  though I've, I've talked to people for hours and hours and hours about it. And only I mean,
[02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:55.080]  I published, I published like stinking 7500 words on it. But even then I have pages and pages of
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:44:00.440]  notes, right? Because this is just like, I always think of that Austin Powers quote, where he's,
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:04.840]  where he's like, Oh, that's not my bag, baby, right? He holds up the book, this kind of thing
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:10.520]  is my bag, baby. This is it, you know, it's like, it's a confluence of everything that I,
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:16.600]  you know, that I find fascinating, you know, and I just, I feel that there's a lot that they're
[02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:20.680]  holding back a because they want, you know, they still want some surprises and whatnot. But
[02:44:20.680 --> 02:44:26.680]  a lot of it is going to come in this just the genuine immersiveness of this land. So they
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.280]  doing a bunch of things here that they haven't done before. One of them is that cast members
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.600]  have a bunch of different costumes to choose from. So if they are a cast member, that's say,
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:43.080]  running the smugglers run ride, which is the Millennium Falcon simulation,
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:49.640]  they can choose their own garments to wear. And then they wear a vest and a hat that identifies
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:56.760]  them as a sort of crew member of this smuggling organization. And so that that's their uniform,
[02:44:56.760 --> 02:45:03.880]  but underneath it, they have a set of a couple of dozen different basic pieces that you might
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:09.800]  wear as a citizen of Batuu. And the citizens in the village, they get to go into work every day,
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:15.240]  and they choose from those pieces. So they say, Hey, my character wears this kind of pant and a
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:21.160]  vest and a shirt and all this stuff, it gives them some, you know, invests investment in the character
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:26.520]  and in the fact that they're going to be role playing. And everybody in the land is going to be
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:31.720]  role playing, all the cast members are going to be role playing as villagers. So you can ask them
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:36.760]  what's going on, you can ask them about the resistance and about the the first order and
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.920]  what their feelings are, they might be really circumspect, or they might confide in you,
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:45.240]  you know, that they're a sympathizer or whatever. And then of course, you have the first order in
[02:45:45.240 --> 02:45:50.760]  their typical uniforms and and the troopers, and then you have the resistance in the resistance
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:56.840]  uniforms. So it's it's a nice mix of things that is very, very thematic and very in world.
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:04.360]  You know, there's a lot of companies that have that create euphemisms for employees,
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:10.200]  you know, like, I forget Walmart has something where they call people associates is the word
[02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:17.800]  at Walmart. And Disney's always called, you know, the staff, the people that work at the parks,
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:25.240]  cast members. And it sounds corny. And, you know, honestly, in my opinion, like at Walmart,
[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:30.280]  it's a true euphemism where, you know, what's the difference between associate employee but at
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:35.880]  Disney, it's always been a bit more like performing. And there's some that are, you know,
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:41.960]  famous, you know, really are a true performance, like the the jungle boat captain, where you
[02:46:41.960 --> 02:46:47.000]  really are performing for the whole thing. Right. Right. But it really does seem better for worse.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.520]  Right. But I think it's fascinating that for all of the technological technological advances that
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:59.800]  are going into this galaxy's edge stuff, from everything from materials to the way they make
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:03.480]  the animatronics, and you go into detail about the difference between the old hydraulic system
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:10.920]  and the new electronic system and how much more lifelike it can be that just the good old fashioned
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:18.440]  just way that they can sort of, to borrow a Walt Disney phrase to plus it is to make the cast
[02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:24.040]  members more, even more, more part of the experience on a personal level. That's right.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:26.840]  Yeah. Yeah. And I think they're there. They have a
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:32.760]  they, they're, there's always been a level of investment in, you know, the sort of experience
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.800]  of Disney that the cast member has, and some people burn out, some people are there for 3040
[02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:43.800]  years, right. And I'm really going to just divorce this discussion, even though, you know, it is
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:48.920]  interrelated. I'm going to divorce this discussion from, you know, how Disney treats its cast members
[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:52.280]  and whether or not I can treat them better and all of that, right. Because they're, they're
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:57.960]  certainly, you know, employees that have a lot of, they give a lot of joy throughout the year and
[02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:02.760]  throughout the have have throughout the decades, just through small interactions, and they're sort
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:09.320]  of in empowered in some ways to do that. So they, you know, my daughter has like bought a toy and
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:13.240]  lost it immediately. They just replaced it for her. They're like, you know, we don't, I don't
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:17.640]  even need to see a receipt here. You know, she's like, Oh, my God, you know, I lost this or, or
[02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:22.280]  this broke or what's up here, just take this, you know, and that kind of stuff is obviously corporate
[02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:30.360]  policy, right? Let's do it. But it's, it's imbued like the invest this idea in the CMs that they
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:38.600]  are there to create an experience for people that, you know, yes, it's money, it's time, it's
[02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:44.280]  travel. But, you know, you forget like, this may be the only time that this person goes to Disneyland
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:49.480]  in their entire childhood, and they'll remember forever. Like, I wasn't a Disney kid. My parents
[02:48:49.480 --> 02:48:53.160]  didn't know about it or like it or even care, you know,
[02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:55.880]  Pete Turner It wasn't even on my family's radar. It really was.
[02:48:55.880 --> 02:48:59.560]  Jay Haynes Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I mean, my dad was like, you know, let's go loot a shipwreck.
[02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:03.800]  Let's, let's go. Let's go to the beach, you know, and all of that stuff. And that's fine. You know,
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:09.320]  I thought I was, you know, I'm complaining. It just wasn't a part of my landscape. However,
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:13.000]  like one time when we were on the travel to somewhere else, they were like, Hey, we got a day.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:18.440]  Let's take them Disneyland, right? We've never been, you know, he's never been let's go. And like,
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:22.520]  I have a picture of me and I remember it. I still remember the smell of it. I think it was like
[02:49:22.520 --> 02:49:30.440]  nine or something. And I have a picture of me on my dad's shoulders with a, a couple of figurines,
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:36.920]  like a C3PO and an R2. This is just after Star Tours had opened. And I remember, you know,
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:42.200]  and it was like, it stuck with me for ever. Right. And in some ways, submitted my love of,
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:47.240]  of Star Wars in a way, you know, because it was like Star Wars in real life of its day, right?
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:52.440]  Star Tours. And then also of, of the parks that created this feeling in me, my wife, on the other
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.520]  hand, went to Disneyland a lot and loved it. And it's sort of a Disney freak. And I did not grow
[02:49:56.520 --> 02:50:01.720]  up that way. I grew into, you know, sort of an appreciation for the company and what, what he
[02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:07.160]  had created, what, what the organization had created, and its philosophies much, much later.
[02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:14.200]  But that may be a revelatory or, or, you know, massively impactful experience for a person. And
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:19.560]  so you're putting a lot, you're putting a lot on an employee that's not paid a whole lot for what
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:25.720]  they do. And they see 1000 people a day, 10,000 people a day, and they're, you know, whatever,
[02:50:25.720 --> 02:50:30.440]  but some small interaction that they may give will absolutely change the way that they do.
[02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:35.240]  Give will absolutely make or break, you hear about these things over and over and over again,
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.120]  oh, they were, you know, it was the true Disney experience, or like, this is why you go and all
[02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:45.160]  of this stuff. And it's the CMS that make that. And so I'm really, really happy to see them giving
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:52.360]  them sort of better tools and a greater reason to invest in that sort of interaction with people
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:59.080]  and all of that. That's fun to see. Yeah. And I really think it goes toward making the whole area
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:05.160]  the attraction as opposed to the area is just sort of a central point where you ping pong around to
[02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.240]  various attractions. I mean, there's very clearly just look at the look at the map when you go to
[02:51:09.240 --> 02:51:13.720]  the park. And there's a very difference between the older themed areas and the newer ones where
[02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:19.160]  the older ones, you'd go to fantasy land, and there's 12 different attractions to ride on,
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:24.200]  you know, or, you know, what most people would call rides, what they call attractions and
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:29.160]  because some of them aren't actually rides. So but, you know, things you get in line for and
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:33.880]  wait for a while, and then you experience them. Whereas the new ones seem to, you know, like the,
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:39.960]  and you mentioned it, you know, that the Pandora world of Avatar, which is at Disney's Animal
[02:51:39.960 --> 02:51:44.920]  Kingdom in Florida was sort of, I'm sure James Cameron wouldn't want to hear it, but it's maybe
[02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:50.920]  sort of a dry run for the Star Wars stuff. Or at least it came first in terms of inventing this
[02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:54.760]  whole world. And it seems like they're doing the same things where all of the food when you're
[02:51:54.760 --> 02:52:01.240]  there is as though you're in that world and in that camp on Pandora, you know, like the,
[02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:05.080]  the beer is literally that there's like a green one and a purple one.
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.880]  Right. And there's one that I like and one that I really don't like. I always forget.
[02:52:12.840 --> 02:52:18.600]  That's funny. Yeah, exactly. All the food is themed all of the in the has a, you know,
[02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:23.080]  people may roll their eyes or whatever, but all the food has a backstory. Like this just isn't
[02:52:23.080 --> 02:52:28.280]  ribs. It's like, you know, kudu ribs or whatever. It's like the animal that Jar Jar rode. And,
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:31.800]  you know, everybody enjoys killing and eating anything that has to do with Jar Jar. But,
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:37.560]  you know, I think that there's, there are ways to do that where you honor the fact that you're
[02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:42.680]  doing a little world building. And yes, it may on any individual level, it may seem silly, but
[02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:48.440]  it adds up to something that is greater than some of its parts. I mean, the merchandise
[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:53.720]  for instance, barely has any labeling or tagging. You know, they just have just enough of a tag to
[02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:57.800]  where they can charge you for it. And, you know, it's actually for sale. Outside of that, it's
[02:52:57.800 --> 02:53:02.840]  extremely minimal packaging whenever possible. It's all themed to the shops. So like you have
[02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:07.400]  a creature shop owner, everything sold in that shop is a creature and every creature does a
[02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:15.000]  little thing like it makes noise or does a, you know, creature, a world or Star Wars, authentic
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:20.520]  noise or activity, you know? So they're just, they're taking it serious. They're really just
[02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:25.720]  going all the way with it. We'll see how much they dial it back later or how much they change
[02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.960]  because these things don't always launch and stay that way as we know. But it's certainly
[02:53:29.960 --> 02:53:34.360]  an interesting bet. So one of the things Disney has always been good at is like, I mentioned
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:38.520]  sight lines before where from point A, if you're not supposed to see world, the other world,
[02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:42.280]  you don't see it. The other thing they've always been really good at are perspective tricks,
[02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:50.440]  a forced perspective where, you know, Main Street USA looks like a two-story town in turn of the
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:55.640]  century, turn of the last century America. And the buildings really aren't two stories tall.
[02:53:55.640 --> 02:54:00.280]  They're like one and a half stories tall. And they do tricks to make that second story look like a
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:08.280]  full second story from the, you know, three, four, five, six foot height of an adult or a small child.
[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:13.240]  And then you really, really get up close and look at them and you can kind of see that's not as big
[02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:18.200]  as I thought. The one thing that is mind blowing about the Pandora in Florida is you get up real
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:22.840]  close to like those mountains and rock formats. And it's like, what the hell is this? Like,
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:28.680]  how did the hell did they make something this big? And how does it not tower so high that you
[02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:34.520]  see it from everywhere? Like how in the world is this mostly hidden from the perspective of the
[02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:39.080]  other areas of the park and you can get right under the base of it and you just feel dwarfed by
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:45.800]  it? Is some of the stuff in the galaxy's edge like that? Yeah, the sense of scale is absolutely
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:53.320]  there. So the towers, the rock towers themselves are about 135 feet tall at their highest point,
[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:59.080]  which is not small, you know, obviously, but it is the maximum height essentially that they
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:05.480]  can build them due to aviation rules in LA. It's basically the same exact height as the
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:12.280]  castle. So they can't make it any higher. In addition to that, though, you also have
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:17.160]  forced perspective at work. So some of the domes which are layered, you know, back to front with
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:21.640]  each other, the domes in the back that look like they're far away are in fact only like a foot
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:25.720]  behind the other one, but they're smaller, right? So they're still using a lot of their same old
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:32.200]  tricks because you know, those work. They're tricks based on the human mind, right? But they
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:37.080]  absolutely are doing things with scale there that they've never done before. Like the buildings are
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:42.680]  bigger, the public spaces are larger than any other land. It's 14 acres total. That includes
[02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:49.160]  ride space. Is that both Florida and California? They're both 14 acres? Okay. They're both parks
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:55.640]  are almost exactly identical in terms of layout and size, about the only major different structural
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:03.080]  issue, particularly is that the Florida Park has two entrances, and the new one has three. So or
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:09.640]  the new one, not new one, but the Disneyland has three. Yeah. But yeah, it's the so walking, you
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:14.440]  walk into the land, we walked in, it's still very much under construction, right? So with that
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:25.160]  caveat, the scale is enormous. I mean, it's immense. The cue for the resistance ride is it's
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:31.720]  amazing. It's the first one I've ever seen with his bench in it. That's in one of the one of the
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:37.720]  engineers viewed that as like a Imagineers view that is like a personal win. Because he's like,
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:42.200]  I'm a dad. And I never had a line with a bench in it. And so I'm really happy I got this line with
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:48.040]  the bench in it. A lot of times when you're the dad, the problem isn't you the dad, and it's not
[02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:52.440]  you the kid. It's the fact that you're the dad with the kid on your shoulders. Yeah, yeah,
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:57.400]  exactly. Exactly. And come back with scoliosis. Right. That's where the bench can really help
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:57:01.800]  everybody, you know? Yeah, we're all in this together. You know, we're all trying to make
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:09.000]  it through. But yeah, the the sense of scale is is there, it's you're gonna you're gonna feel it
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:16.680]  like this is a real living big city or big village that I'm in. The buildings are full height, they
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:20.600]  are not, you know, scaled down. And it doesn't feel like when you get close, like, Oh, okay,
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:28.200]  I see what they did here. You know, it's actually full height. A lot of the park is or a lot of the
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:34.200]  land has been built to a way where the one of the big problems has always been like seeing what's
[02:57:34.200 --> 02:57:39.960]  going on. And so they built the entire thing on a tiered structure, which they've never done with
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:43.560]  any other land. And there's some other lands that have like a transition, like you're going from
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:49.240]  here to there up to down or whatever. But never in this sort of like sloping tiered way, they
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:57.160]  essentially built it so that you're always looking over people at something. So that there's the
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:01.800]  performers, for instance, of the cast members, when they come out from backstage, they have
[02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:06.600]  their own entrance from backstage, directly to where they're going to do their thing, like say
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:13.400]  repair an x wing that's, you know, sitting there in need of repairs, or, you know, maintain the
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:19.560]  Falcon or whatever, if it's chewy, for instance, they can come right in from backstage, they can
[02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:24.280]  come into an area where they're elevated, so people can see them from all around. You know,
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:28.760]  you don't have to, you're not crowding in to see what they're doing, or to try and get a glimpse
[02:58:28.760 --> 02:58:33.800]  of them. So they built this in, it seems all logical now, but none of the other lands have
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:37.880]  been built this way. And it's always been a big problem for CMS, like, they got to get from
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:42.440]  backstage to where they are, you know, where they're performing or whatever they're doing.
[02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:45.800]  And there's always that awkward thing where they're walking and people are trying to, you know,
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:50.760]  to meet them or stop them or say hi or take a picture. And they're like, yeah, I gotta,
[02:58:50.760 --> 02:58:55.880]  you know, I gotta skedaddle. And then when they're there, you gotta wait in line to see them. You
[02:58:55.880 --> 02:58:59.720]  can't see them, you know? So there's lots of interesting things like that that they did,
[02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:07.560]  which is a first for any land. But like, I will tell you, the moment you turn the corner,
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:14.520]  and you see the full size, a hundred foot long Falcon for the first time, I literally,
[02:59:15.400 --> 02:59:21.240]  I said bad words. And it wasn't, I don't generally do that much. Like when I'm taking a press tour,
[02:59:21.240 --> 02:59:26.440]  I'm not like, you know, Apple show me the iPhone. I'm like, cool, this is neat. You know? Oh,
[02:59:26.440 --> 02:59:32.840]  what does this do? You know, I'm not like, I don't fall over in awe. But when you see the Falcon for
[02:59:32.840 --> 02:59:38.360]  the first time in real life, it is, it's intense. It's intense. People are going to lose their
[02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:44.840]  minds. You came here in this, you're braver than I thought. Exactly. Everything runs through your
[02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:49.160]  mind. You know, all the things run through your mind and it's, it's cool, man. They're going to
[02:59:49.160 --> 02:59:53.160]  have it set up to where it like, you know, it'll make engine noises. Like they're trying to start
[02:59:53.160 --> 02:59:59.160]  it up and repair it. It's going to pop steam and stuff like that. Exactly. Exactly. Do you know
[02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:04.200]  what, what are they doing with the star tours ride? I can't imagine they're getting rid of it.
[03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:10.200]  I mean, in Florida, is that going to be within the confines somehow? Well, no. So they're not moving
[03:00:10.200 --> 03:00:14.280]  either one of them. They're staying where they are. That's their current, that's their current
[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:19.160]  statement. Right? So I don't know what their actual plans are. Sometimes they're different
[03:00:19.160 --> 03:00:24.280]  than what they say. But what what they said very carefully is there are no plans this time to move
[03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:31.160]  them. So, you know, they're staying where they are. They're not moving. They're staying, you know,
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:35.880]  the Disneyland one is staying in Tomorrowland. So they're just going to keep them there. I mean,
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:42.120]  you know, what can you do? It's either that or you, or you move them. You know what I mean? And
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.920]  that's not a, that's not an easy task. No, because I think they're basically just trying to open this
[03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:53.880]  thing and see how it goes. Yeah. One of the things it seems to me, one of the things that bugs me
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:58.040]  as a Star Wars nerd, let me get a little Star Wars nerdy here and not Disney nerdy. But one of the
[03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:02.360]  things that bugs me about the new Star Wars, the updated Star Tours is that you go in that you're
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:10.680]  in, you know, the basic premise is you're in a, like a commercial sightseeing shuttle, and things
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:17.480]  go wrong. And somehow you're, you're on a, you know, mission of racing away from the Empire or
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:23.800]  the First Order or something. And you hit hyperspace and you go somewhere and you go
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:28.600]  somewhere that's from one of the movies. And you're getting shot at and all sorts of danger
[03:01:29.240 --> 03:01:34.440]  and cool things. And then it's like hyperspace again. And you have another adventure from one
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:39.000]  of the other movies, and then you hyperspace again, and you finish up. And then it's, you
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:43.560]  know, there you go get the hell out, you know, next, next group's coming in. And it's cool
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:49.400]  because they mix it up and it's randomized. And so you can go twice and hopefully you'll have
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.560]  the luck that you won't, you know, you might, you might go three times and not see the same
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:02:00.360]  segment twice. That's right. Which is really nice. But as a Star Wars nerd, it drives me nuts
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:05.800]  because the whole ride's premise is that you're the passengers on a ship having a continuous
[03:02:05.800 --> 03:02:10.360]  adventure that is separated by three jumps to hyperspace. But the segments come from
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:14.600]  three different trilogies that take place 20 to 30 years apart.
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:17.960]  So you're traveling through time and space, everything at once.
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:23.880]  Right. Like all of a sudden you're on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back, and then you're back,
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:30.920]  you know, on the Attack of the Clones or something like that. And then you wind up in, you know,
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:39.480]  you know, the new trilogy with Rey and those characters. And it makes no sense at all.
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:44.680]  It gets, you know, I get it that, you know, the original Star Tours, because it was from the 80s,
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:49.400]  they just stuck to the original trilogy. And while it was not as good a ride, at least it
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:54.520]  made chronological sense in the Star Wars universe. And I get that they, they didn't want
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:03:02.680]  to pick one trilogy, you know, for the update because which one would you pick? And they
[03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:08.360]  certainly weren't going to not have it updated for the new movies as they come out, which would,
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:13.240]  you know, which would, so I get why they did it, but it bothers me as a Star Wars nerd.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:18.680]  What I like from your description of Batuu, the whole land is it seems like the land takes place
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:24.840]  in a consistent, consistently in the new trilogy, the latest third trilogy timeline.
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:32.600]  Yes, it's not, it's not around us at a specific movie or during a specific movie is in that era,
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:36.680]  right? That's the way they refer to it. So they're, I don't believe they're going to know
[03:03:36.680 --> 03:03:43.160]  of things going on, you know, in that in the movie timeline. And Batuu has already been integrated,
[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:50.040]  as Disney does, in many of its books, and it's mentioned in the movie already, and all of that
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:56.120]  stuff, you know, but it is a it is going to be a part of the universe. And you're going to be
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:03.320]  in this place while the movie trilogy era is happening, but not at a specific time.
[03:04:03.320 --> 03:04:07.240]  No, but I think that's the right way to do it. Right. I think that putting it in that era,
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:12.200]  just specific enough. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. You're within a year or two that,
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:17.640]  you know, the, the most span of the movie happens. Yeah. And I think it's the right move. You know,
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:21.800]  I'm, of course, in the most nostalgic for the original trilogy, but I feel like the kids of
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:26.280]  today are going to be the most excited about the latest trilogy. And so it makes sense to put it
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:29.720]  there. All right, let me get really Star Wars nerdy on you here. And one of the characters
[03:04:29.720 --> 03:04:35.400]  that's an animatronic is Hondo Onaka. Now I remember him because I watched the animated
[03:04:35.400 --> 03:04:40.360]  Clone Wars series, and he was a major recurring character. And it sounds like he's a really cool
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:47.160]  animatronic. But from your article, Hondo is now the proprietor of the Onaka transport solutions
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:52.840]  and has been loaned to the Millennium Falcon by Chewie for some quote deliveries. All right,
[03:04:52.840 --> 03:04:59.960]  let me just say there is no way Chewbacca is loaning the Millennium Falcon to anybody, let
[03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:08.200]  alone to Hondo Onaka. I got a real problem. I got a real problem with that. Why isn't Chewie flying
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:13.640]  the thing? And then the next character you talk about is one of my all time favorite little
[03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:17.560]  characters who, who in the world knows why I knew his name because he's got like two lines,
[03:05:17.560 --> 03:05:25.080]  but Neenam, who most people will remember was Lando's co-pilot for the Falcon during the
[03:05:25.080 --> 03:05:31.880]  climactic battle scene in The Return of the Jedi. Now Neenam is on the other ride, though. He's on
[03:05:31.880 --> 03:05:37.400]  the resistance attraction, right? Right. Well, they should have put Neenam as the guy who flies
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:45.560]  the Falcon because he has piloted and Chewbacca maybe would loan it to Neenam. Right.
[03:05:45.560 --> 03:05:51.800]  Well, there is a book that explains, that explains why,
[03:05:54.120 --> 03:05:59.480]  why he has, they did give it to us. It's actually a children's book. I gave it to my daughter,
[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:06.840]  but it explains why they, this is happening, you know, why he has lent him the Falcon. So there is
[03:06:06.840 --> 03:06:11.880]  some sort of in universe explanation, but that said, I completely understand where you're coming
[03:06:11.880 --> 03:06:19.640]  from. It's like, wait, what? I will say the animatronic is super stellar though. It's,
[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:25.880]  it's very, very, very smooth. I think the, you know, it's, as far as levels of
[03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:33.320]  complexity, the, the shaman is still above it, you know, in terms of how much it can do. And
[03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:42.360]  that's the shaman is, is a Pandora and native Pandora and on the Navi river ride over in Pandora.
[03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:49.080]  Exactly. Yeah. And that Navi shaman is incredible animatronic. Absolutely incredible. We, we had
[03:06:49.080 --> 03:06:53.080]  the head a couple of years ago at one of our robotics events, just the head and they de-skinned
[03:06:53.080 --> 03:06:57.480]  it for us. It was super, super cool to watch up close. But even when, when you're watching the
[03:06:57.480 --> 03:07:02.840]  ride, it's amazing. Let me say this, I've been on the ride and let me take the devil's advocate
[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:07.560]  position and say, I totally appreciate. And, but part of this is because I read your article and
[03:07:07.560 --> 03:07:16.600]  knew it going in the face and head is amazing, but the whole animatronic as a whole is a bit static.
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:22.600]  I mean, I guess that's the shaman isn't supposed to move, but it's, it makes sense that almost all
[03:07:22.600 --> 03:07:28.440]  of the, the amazing, you know, look how amazing this is, is all in the face. And the other thing
[03:07:28.440 --> 03:07:33.640]  I'll say, well, let me ask you this, the two routes or the two attractions, there's the
[03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:38.440]  resistance ride, and then there's the Falcon ride. It sounds from, to me, from your description that
[03:07:38.440 --> 03:07:44.280]  neither one of them is really the A ride and the B ride. They, they both seem like A rides.
[03:07:45.880 --> 03:07:52.200]  Yeah. They would both be considered an E ticket in the old parlance, right? They absolutely double
[03:07:52.200 --> 03:08:00.280]  E ticket if that existed, right? Cause they're, they're absolutely a high level of, you know,
[03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:05.240]  world building high level of theming, you know, intense amount of work that went into them.
[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:14.280]  However, the rise of the resistance ride is significantly bigger in terms of the size,
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:21.240]  length, complexity, all of that. It's the first ride that Disney has done of its kind, I believe.
[03:08:21.240 --> 03:08:26.920]  And the Falcon ride is essentially like, what if we built Star Wars with Star Tours with today's
[03:08:26.920 --> 03:08:33.480]  technology and made it interactive, which is not a small feat, you know, but it's, it's also known.
[03:08:33.480 --> 03:08:38.920]  It's a known quantity, you know, whereas the rise of the resistance is a new thing. There is guest
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:45.720]  interaction by cast members during the ride. There is you're on foot, you're, you're on a vehicle
[03:08:45.720 --> 03:08:53.720]  that quote unquote flies. Then you're on a riding vehicle. Like you're in multiple venues,
[03:08:53.720 --> 03:09:00.200]  Death Star hanger. Was it a Death Star hanger? Not a Death Star hanger, but a, a Star Destroyer
[03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:04.200]  hanger. Star Destroyer hanger. Yeah. And so, you know, you're in a hanger, you're,
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:09.960]  you're flying on a resistance vehicle. You're in a resistance base. You're in a, in a cell,
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:14.360]  like a detention cell, you know, you move from place to place. None of this happens,
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:20.440]  you know, in on a ride, right? So it is a, it is an experience in a way that is different. So
[03:09:20.440 --> 03:09:25.480]  I don't think that either one of them necessarily are, you know, Oh, this is the A ticket is the B
[03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:30.360]  ticket. They're both going to be incredibly popular. And I think just as popular to
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:34.600]  different people who want different things. Like if your dream has always been to fly the Falcon,
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:38.840]  I mean, there's no substitute. You know, you can't see this on an audio podcast,
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:45.320]  but I just raised my hand. Yeah, exactly. I just raised my hand and my eyes are watering up a
[03:09:45.320 --> 03:09:53.240]  little bit. Right. And that, you know, that sense of what, right. If you're going to be,
[03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:58.040]  yeah, if the less, the less expansive of the two rides is the one where you fly the Millennium
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:04.680]  Falcon. That's exactly. And that's the, that's the like, Oh cool, we'll do that too. Then yeah,
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:09.560]  you're in good shape. So the difference between Pandora, have you ever been there? Have you ever
[03:10:09.560 --> 03:10:14.040]  been to the Florida parks? You know, no, no. So you've never been to the Florida ones and I've
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:19.080]  never been to California. Well, exactly. So we, we go every year. So I've been to the Pandora a
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:24.280]  couple of times and the, the two, they, they do this, it's the same sort of formula. It's an
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:29.240]  all encompassing world, surprisingly big, all these rocks and very immersive, all the food,
[03:10:29.240 --> 03:10:34.840]  all the merchandise. There's all sorts of stuff when you're not in a ride, that's really
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:38.840]  technically impressive. One of the things in the Pandora world that they have is, you know how in
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:47.400]  that, in that Pandora universe, the, the, the humans have these big robots that they ride in,
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:52.280]  you know, like, you know, they have one, they have a real one. I mean, like there's a real guy
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:57.320]  in and it walks around and then he takes, you know, he'll stop and he'll take questions from
[03:10:57.320 --> 03:11:02.280]  kids about who'll ask, you know, all in universe, like, you know, how high can you jump? And he's
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:07.320]  like, well, this, this, this model, the one I'm in is actually set to a low power mode for the
[03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:11.640]  safety. Cause we know there's a bunch of you around here, but if I, if we turned it on,
[03:11:11.640 --> 03:11:18.040]  I could jump about five feet in the air. Yeah. Gotcha. You know, but it's super, but the cool
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:23.560]  thing about that sort of thing is they're making it, there's so much more fun that you can have
[03:11:23.560 --> 03:11:26.600]  that you never knew you were going to have that you're not waiting in line for it. You're just
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:29.800]  there. And all of a sudden this guy in a robot suit comes out, you know,
[03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:36.520]  but the, the flight of passage attraction, they have two. So part of the formula to two
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:42.200]  attractions, big land, the flight of passage ride is the greatest theme park attraction I've ever
[03:11:42.200 --> 03:11:49.000]  been on in my life. It is. And my wife and son were in unanimous agreement. It is mind-blowingly
[03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:53.800]  immersive. I almost don't even want to say anything, you know, on the show other than
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:59.640]  it really does feel like you're flying around Pandora. It is. And the scope is amazing. The
[03:11:59.640 --> 03:12:10.360]  scale it's, it's just incredible. The Navi river passage is like a boat ride, right? It's right.
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:16.760]  It is. It's, it's like you're on, you know, a really nice version of it's a small world.
[03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:23.960]  Uh, you know, it, it, it is not, it, it, it, it is very clear difference between the two,
[03:12:23.960 --> 03:12:27.800]  which one is, is the bigger attraction, which if you can only do one, which one you should do.
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:31.480]  Whereas it seems like in star Wars, it's, it's a lot closer call.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.960]  Yeah. I mean, I think that maybe I don't want to, I didn't, I don't have any inside info on this,
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:42.440]  but I think maybe they know that, right? Like maybe they, they understand that the boat ride
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:47.720]  is awesome, but if you're going to do star Wars and you're going to promise this interactive,
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:53.320]  you know, kind of immersive world that has to extend to the rides too. And the, it really,
[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:57.480]  from, I wasn't able to ride the completed ride because it's literally not completed,
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.760]  but from what we were able to see of the experience, that is true of this. It is not,
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:09.000]  you don't sit passively on a boat or on a car and let it, you know,
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:14.840]  travel you through this. You're not sitting there just watching a bunch of animatronics
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:19.880]  do their thing. You know, that's not what this is about. It's, you know, multiple characters
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:25.720]  you're interacting with, multiple experiences that you get to, that you get to take part in.
[03:13:25.720 --> 03:13:30.680]  You feel like you are part of the universe. You're, you know, the adventures that you're
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:38.360]  having are in universe and sort of, you know, feel like they could be in the movie, you know,
[03:13:38.360 --> 03:13:42.280]  that kind of thing. And they're using a bunch of different tech to get it done. So that's not,
[03:13:42.920 --> 03:13:47.160]  this isn't the same deal as that. It's not like, Hey, we're taking an existing ride thing.
[03:13:47.160 --> 03:13:51.480]  We're putting a new theme on it and we're, we're putting some cool animatronics in front of you.
[03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:55.320]  It's not that. So the bay and the basic description of the Falcon ride seems so cool.
[03:13:55.320 --> 03:13:59.400]  It's like, you're in the real Falcon. It's the room, you know, there's the chessboard. It's,
[03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:03.880]  it's all to scale. It's like, you're really there. And then in groups of six, they load you in and
[03:14:03.880 --> 03:14:09.400]  you're in the Millennium Falcon cockpit. And then everybody gets roles. Like there's two pilots and
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:15.080]  two gunners and two, I forget what else there were, but you all have things to do. And it
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:22.680]  actually really does interact with the result of, of what you get. Like you have to push buttons at
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:28.680]  the right time and you can get like, you know, I guess that no matter what, like the Millennium
[03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:35.720]  Falcon isn't exploding and you know, they were very explicit in that your ride would always
[03:14:35.720 --> 03:14:39.960]  complete. So you're always going to be the mission. The Falcons mission will always be
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:43.640]  successful. I think is the phrase that they used, right? They don't want anybody getting, you know,
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:48.360]  waiting hours to get this ride. Some guy doesn't do his piloting job out the gate and you crash
[03:14:48.360 --> 03:14:55.480]  immediately. You have to get off. And I know it's laughable for the next 10, 15, probably 20 years
[03:14:55.480 --> 03:15:03.080]  that there's going to be an empty seat. But you know, 30 years from now when Star Wars Galaxy
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:07.080]  Edge is no longer the, you know, the main attraction and it's the end of the night and you
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:10.680]  get in and there's only three of you and there is nobody in the gunner's seats. You're not going to
[03:15:10.680 --> 03:15:15.080]  get, you know, you're not going to get blown up. That's right. That's right. What they said is
[03:15:15.080 --> 03:15:21.720]  instead you have two pilots, two engineers, two gunners. And so each person has a role. So if the
[03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:27.240]  pilot does their thing at the right time, you execute a maneuver and avoid a TIE fighter's fire.
[03:15:27.880 --> 03:15:33.880]  Great. If you get, if you don't do it in time and you get hit, now the engineer has work to do,
[03:15:33.880 --> 03:15:38.920]  right? And so they can fix, they can put out the fire that was caused by the TIE fighter blast,
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:45.800]  by the blaster blast. They can, you know, your gunner can shoot it down. If he shoots it down
[03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:50.120]  late, maybe you get, you know, etc. And they were working together. So they come through battered,
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:54.680]  but you're going to get through. So there's a ride at Epcot called mission space. And the
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:16:00.200]  basic idea is that you're on like a experimental mission to Mars and there's four of you in each
[03:16:00.200 --> 03:16:05.480]  little thing. And there's like a same, it's a similar, or, you know, obviously a similar
[03:16:05.480 --> 03:16:09.160]  thinking, you know, one of you is the pilot, one's the mission commander, one's the engineer,
[03:16:09.160 --> 03:16:15.480]  and one is navigator or something. And there's points in it where you're supposed to flip
[03:16:15.480 --> 03:16:19.560]  switches and stuff. And much like you said about the Falcon stuff, you've got all these switches
[03:16:19.560 --> 03:16:23.240]  to flip and you push buttons and they beep and they bloop and they all feel like real,
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:28.600]  like NASA quality switches. And they must be because they've been there for 10 or 15 years
[03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:32.680]  at this point. And they're all still in working order, you know, like they're all like serious
[03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:37.320]  industrial grade switches. But it's cool because you can start playing with them before the ride
[03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:42.440]  starts. Like you, you, you load in, you put your seatbelt on and lower your harness. And then you
[03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:46.680]  can sit there and like bleep and bloop and flip all these switches. But then there's a certain
[03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:51.240]  part in the mission where you're supposed to do stuff. Well, if you don't do it, not one thing
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:58.200]  changes. Like you can do everything wrong. Like absolutely nothing changes. It makes you feel
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:02.120]  like something changes. And maybe if you're a young enough kid and you're not really paying
[03:17:02.120 --> 03:17:07.640]  attention, you might think you did something. But having been on it numerous times, there is no,
[03:17:09.240 --> 03:17:12.840]  not, not one iota changes of what you actually see on the screen.
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:18.840]  Yeah. Yeah. So that's not very empowering. No, but it makes sense because it seems like that's
[03:17:18.840 --> 03:17:23.720]  an easier way to make a ride where you're loading hundreds of people, you know, an hour. Whereas to
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:27.720]  have it actually be interactive is seems like a genuine technical breakthrough.
[03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:35.640]  Yeah, it is. I mean, they, you know, each particular each cockpit of which there are
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:44.360]  multiple obviously to get, you know, otherwise you'd be there all day. Six people at a time.
[03:17:44.360 --> 03:17:46.760]  Seventy-five people can get on this today out of 10,000.
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:52.040]  I love that you asked how many cockpits they have and they wouldn't answer.
[03:17:52.040 --> 03:17:54.120]  That's exactly. They wouldn't tell me.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:56.840]  That's exactly the way that Disney is like Apple, right?
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:02.680]  Exactly. Like if I'm like, oh, cool. Yeah. How many, how many transistors are like,
[03:18:02.680 --> 03:18:11.240]  does that really matter? But yeah, the, the multiple cockpits basically enable them to
[03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:15.880]  load multiple people, but each of those cockpits has to be a completely independent projection
[03:18:15.880 --> 03:18:20.200]  system that reacts in real time. So it's rendering everything in real time as you
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:26.600]  make your decisions. So each one has to have its own rendering pipeline and basically render farm
[03:18:26.600 --> 03:18:32.760]  attached to it that can make it happen. I can't wait. I'll be flying the Falcon. Oh,
[03:18:33.560 --> 03:18:35.480]  I know I'm going to wind up stuck being the engineer.
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:38.680]  How long do you think the weight's going to be for, for pilot?
[03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:43.960]  I don't know. Do they wait for the front? Right? They didn't say, they didn't say, but
[03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:48.360]  that's good. You know, okay. Stand over here and wait with these other 10,000 people that
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:51.720]  want to be the pilot. And sit in the front. Do you think they'll make them sit differently?
[03:18:51.720 --> 03:18:54.680]  A lot of times at Disney, they don't really let you wait for the front like that. Like
[03:18:54.680 --> 03:19:01.080]  they just kind of, I don't know. I think most of the coasters, they let you wait for your spot,
[03:19:01.080 --> 03:19:06.760]  but I don't know. Yeah. It's going to be, that's going to be a Rocham Boeing. I think amongst your
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:12.440]  pilot group, your flight group, if you go, go in groups of six, because then you, you guys can
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:20.120]  come to a gentle person's agreement. All right. That is fantastic. I can't wait to see this
[03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:24.600]  myself. Although I won't be able to see it this summer because in Florida it won't open until
[03:19:24.600 --> 03:19:28.600]  September or something, but I'm still looking forward to it. And I absolutely loved your
[03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:34.200]  article and honestly came away from your 6,000 word well illustrated piece with so many questions.
[03:19:37.320 --> 03:19:45.880]  Yeah. I thank you as always for your time. You are at panzer, P A N Z E R on, on the Twitters
[03:19:45.880 --> 03:19:53.080]  and everybody can read your fine work and the work of your staff at a tech crunch.com. Anything else
[03:19:53.080 --> 03:19:57.880]  you want to, you want to mention? No, I think I'm good. All right. May the force be with you.
[03:19:57.880 --> 03:20:15.880]  Appreciate it. I really appreciate you as well.
