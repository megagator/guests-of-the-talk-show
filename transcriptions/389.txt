[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  Gabe this is a little weird because
[00:03.520 --> 00:09.720]  part of my checklist before I start recording an episode of this show because I usually disappear for
[00:10.440 --> 00:16.180]  Anywhere from two hours to two hours plus while recording the show is before I start I check tech meme
[00:16.820 --> 00:18.820]  to make sure
[00:18.840 --> 00:20.840]  No news has broken
[00:22.680 --> 00:26.140]  And I feel like I don't have to do it I can just ask you Gabe
[00:26.140 --> 00:31.240]  Is there any breaking news on tech meme that we should talk about keeping track of it?
[00:31.240 --> 00:37.440]  Today was a big day for Microsoft, but I don't remember anything too big in the past few minutes. I
[00:38.760 --> 00:42.520]  Presume because I mentioned it on Derek fireball frequently
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.280]  I tell anybody who would ask but you know what a pillar
[00:46.560 --> 00:53.280]  Tech meme is of my media diet at least but can you talk about I mean just for anybody who doesn't know you're here to
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.240]  Talk about it. When did you start tech meme?
[00:55.240 --> 00:57.560]  What is tech meme? How does it work?
[00:59.200 --> 01:01.200]  Those are some big questions
[01:01.700 --> 01:03.160]  okay, so
[01:03.160 --> 01:06.180]  Well, thanks for thanks for calling it a pillar
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.020]  when we do what we do to keep it going every day we keep
[01:11.800 --> 01:16.640]  people like you in mind like writers who are like in the know and need to
[01:16.840 --> 01:21.480]  Have a high-level view of the industry and like tech execs and people like that
[01:21.480 --> 01:27.160]  So as long as we're relevant to you guys, we're doing our job. How did it get started?
[01:27.160 --> 01:30.240]  So, let's see. I've always been like
[01:31.120 --> 01:37.400]  Messing with news aggregators and like little things to get news from websites because I've always been interested in news
[01:37.400 --> 01:43.620]  So back in the early aughts I'd seen the the rise of blogging the bloggers
[01:44.800 --> 01:51.040]  Have a good grasp of what's interesting and what's trending and if you just follow a bunch of blogs and see what they're looking
[01:51.040 --> 01:57.420]  To you could see what's important. So I just I started writing like a little aggregator
[01:57.420 --> 01:59.680]  They would see what are the news stories that are linked to?
[02:00.720 --> 02:05.080]  most by basically political bloggers called it meme or random and
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  The way I worked is
[02:10.080 --> 02:14.320]  There would be like mainstream media news sites and then underneath of
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.360]  Those headlines it would be the bloggers
[02:17.360 --> 02:23.320]  so the bloggers were always like the peanut gallery and the mainstream sites were always the the top so
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.600]  Having seen
[02:26.600 --> 02:30.880]  And I by the way, I launched that site a few bloggers had picked it up, but it wasn't like a big deal
[02:31.220 --> 02:37.700]  Then I thought okay now it's time to do a revision where the bloggers can be the top headline. There is no
[02:38.280 --> 02:46.060]  Build-in hierarchy anyone can be the top headline and when I when I built that I decided to do a tech vertical
[02:46.060 --> 02:52.820]  Keep the political vertical and so I launched those at the same time and and the tech one is the one that took off and
[02:52.820 --> 02:55.460]  and then I renamed it tech meme a few months later and
[02:56.060 --> 03:01.740]  Ever since then the idea is be a good industry news aggregator
[03:01.820 --> 03:08.280]  That has taken a lot of twists and turns over the years, but I think in many ways we've been very consistent
[03:08.280 --> 03:11.480]  And what is it? It's like the best the moat like the essential
[03:12.260 --> 03:14.020]  tech industry
[03:14.020 --> 03:16.100]  news headlines and
[03:17.460 --> 03:19.460]  float posts that you need to see
[03:19.780 --> 03:26.920]  At the moment to update your knowledge on what's happening so that you can be informed and make decisions and all that stuff
[03:27.340 --> 03:29.340]  That important people need to do
[03:29.940 --> 03:33.460]  Tech meme is great for several reasons. I use it every day
[03:33.740 --> 03:37.380]  It's usually something I do in the morning just to see what happened overnight
[03:37.380 --> 03:43.140]  It did anything happen usually because I'm in the East Coast even though I kind of sleep on West Coast hours
[03:43.140 --> 03:48.740]  It's usually nothing really broke overnight, but sometimes sometimes stuff happens
[03:50.060 --> 03:56.040]  Early Eastern time because of a embargo or something like that, but it's just part of my
[03:56.820 --> 03:58.820]  Well, is anything going on?
[03:59.460 --> 04:05.280]  Recognize recognize I know about that. Okay. Oh, that's interesting. Hmm open up a couple tabs. All right
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.900]  Pour another cup of coffee move on
[04:08.300 --> 04:09.580]  but
[04:09.580 --> 04:11.780]  the other part is like if I'm
[04:11.780 --> 04:12.780]  I'm
[04:12.780 --> 04:15.540]  traveling if I'm on vacation if it's
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.860]  You know like an Apple event day where I'm in Cupertino
[04:21.180 --> 04:26.860]  Because I don't know new iPhone 15 is being launched and I'm heads down all day in
[04:27.580 --> 04:32.700]  That environment and I just want to say what else is going on in the rest of the world
[04:32.700 --> 04:37.140]  it offers like mental closure to me to go to tech meme and
[04:37.140 --> 04:44.480]  And scan the list and say is there anything else? Of course, I got an iPhone 15 day. iPhone 15 is on tech meme
[04:44.900 --> 04:50.200]  Okay, here's but did I miss anything? Is there anything that I missed? Nope. Okay, scroll down scroll down
[04:50.580 --> 04:55.620]  Okay caught up and then I know that I'm caught up on like the tech sphere
[04:55.620 --> 05:01.060]  I know yeah caught up and it's a good feeling. I guess there there are two things I can say that number one
[05:01.060 --> 05:07.800]  What helps in that what makes it a little easier for tech meme to be that is we rewrite almost all the headlines that they're?
[05:07.800 --> 05:10.240]  Very descriptive. So you'll need to do a lot of clicking
[05:10.800 --> 05:15.960]  And another thing that gives you that peace of mind is we don't have a page to which we all have an infinite scroll
[05:15.960 --> 05:19.080]  It's just you get to the bottom and and you're caught up. Of course
[05:19.080 --> 05:22.800]  There's more to read in the world. But if you want that kind of view you are caught up
[05:24.400 --> 05:28.880]  The other thing though that I find very interesting is the way that tech meme batches
[05:28.880 --> 05:31.600]  Stories together. I'm looking at it right now
[05:32.160 --> 05:39.200]  Microsoft announces the Maya 100 chip for Azure clients blah blah blah and it doesn't really matter what the story is right now
[05:39.200 --> 05:44.760]  as you and I record by the time this episodes out that'll have scrolled off the bottom, but then it says more and
[05:45.280 --> 05:52.600]  the lead article links to Bloomberg's coverage of this and then you've got coverage from Microsoft itself the verge venture beat and
[05:52.600 --> 06:00.600]  On at Tom's Hardware CNBC at least two dozen other sources all linking to the same story. That's
[06:01.880 --> 06:10.160]  Human-aggregated it correct. So yeah, yes and no we we we've all like when tech meme launched
[06:10.160 --> 06:12.160]  It was like it was all
[06:13.120 --> 06:20.460]  Algorithmic, there's this news crawling and an analysis engine I built to surface trending
[06:20.460 --> 06:26.560]  News and when there's trending news, there's usually like other blogs and news outlets covering it
[06:26.560 --> 06:34.560]  so often linking to that so the algorithm could help tie it all up and then sometimes group related coverage, but over time
[06:35.400 --> 06:39.200]  For a number of reasons algorithms don't really cut it in all situations
[06:39.440 --> 06:47.680]  Sometimes the story is suddenly suddenly expires because some new event happened and then sometimes just there's the algorithm that groups things
[06:47.680 --> 06:54.940]  Groups things that shouldn't be grouped together and we still kind of fight against that. The human editors will sometimes break things up
[06:54.940 --> 06:57.440]  so a lot of the grouping you see is
[06:58.280 --> 07:03.400]  When it comes to news headlines, it's mostly automated when it comes to social posts. There's
[07:04.920 --> 07:11.320]  There's like an approval process but a lot of the recommendations are also automated so it's it's a dance involving
[07:11.320 --> 07:16.520]  Algorithms and our editors one thing though, and again, I'm not just saying this to
[07:17.240 --> 07:23.960]  Compliment you but I I think it stands out and I think anybody who's been reading tech meme for a long time would agree
[07:24.520 --> 07:27.080]  tech meme has never lost sight of
[07:27.800 --> 07:30.600]  The fact that you were targeting
[07:31.400 --> 07:35.240]  The reader first that it is a reader first
[07:35.240 --> 07:41.000]  Presentation of news of let's be respectful of our readers our visitors
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.120]  Whatever you want to call them their attention when you do rewrite headlines it is
[07:46.760 --> 07:48.760]  only for
[07:49.000 --> 07:54.120]  Clarification it's not to take the piss and vinegar out of a punchy headline it is to
[07:55.080 --> 08:01.480]  Take the click baiting us out of it. It really is and I think that's human done right now
[08:01.480 --> 08:05.320]  It really is and I think that's human done, right?
[08:05.320 --> 08:11.000]  You guys don't use AI or anything algorithmically to to do the headline rewriting
[08:11.000 --> 08:16.280]  I know art artifact has started doing that and I'd like to talk about artifact in a moment
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.860]  But I find the way they do it to be irritating
[08:19.720 --> 08:25.960]  Not that I haven't noticed when you've done it with daring fireball posts, but i've never once objected to it. Oh, that's good
[08:25.960 --> 08:32.040]  Occasionally we get objections like once in a while. We'll make an error, but we try to be basically
[08:32.680 --> 08:37.240]  Descriptive and yeah, definitely respecting the reader like that goes through everything we do
[08:37.560 --> 08:38.120]  But yeah
[08:38.120 --> 08:40.200]  We want to give like little summaries where?
[08:41.080 --> 08:46.280]  If you just want the most high level view if you just want to know what it's about
[08:46.920 --> 08:53.000]  You can get that from the headline. But but of course because it's just a headline if you have any kind of
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.060]  Curiosity that goes deeper you'll need to click and and get get that deeper look
[08:58.540 --> 09:03.500]  What's the name? I've given myself five minutes here to think of it and I can't so i'm going to ask you
[09:03.500 --> 09:06.380]  I think you'll remember. What was the name of the
[09:07.500 --> 09:10.060]  I would say it was a competitor to tech meme
[09:10.620 --> 09:14.060]  In the early days in the early aughts it was green
[09:14.620 --> 09:18.940]  And it was mostly focused on blogs and a sort of ranking
[09:18.940 --> 09:23.420]  They had the ranking of the top hundred blogs at any given time
[09:24.380 --> 09:31.980]  Yeah, I think they're thinking of technorati technorati. That's exactly it right and I can't I can't say they were they proceeded well
[09:32.700 --> 09:34.700]  But yeah, they had I think
[09:34.780 --> 09:40.540]  Everyone went through iterations where they competed with us in the in that era where they provided some kind of blog summary
[09:40.620 --> 09:44.700]  But they were originally a blog search engine, but the rankings were sort of
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.740]  competitive in a way that it's
[09:47.740 --> 09:55.100]  It's not a direct competition but obliquely so to me a pure feed reader like a net news wire is just
[09:55.980 --> 09:59.580]  as a user here's the feeds I want to subscribe to
[10:00.380 --> 10:06.620]  Put them in a list and then give me all the posts from those feeds and let me sort by chronological order and read
[10:06.940 --> 10:12.060]  And that's it whether it's a web-based thing or an app like net news wire
[10:12.460 --> 10:16.220]  It has no opinion or tries to do any kind of ranking. It's just
[10:16.220 --> 10:18.220]  Uh more like an email client, right?
[10:18.860 --> 10:20.860]  email your email client most people's
[10:21.820 --> 10:24.460]  I know superhuman is a little weird like that, but
[10:25.500 --> 10:31.260]  For the most part you just want your email in order, right? Here's the new messages read them reply to them
[10:31.340 --> 10:37.820]  You're done and feed readers are sort of like that and technorati was trying to do a little more some kind of
[10:38.620 --> 10:40.460]  ranking type thing
[10:40.460 --> 10:42.460]  like so many
[10:42.460 --> 10:48.060]  Success stories. It was fleeting, right? It was like it burst onto the scene
[10:48.220 --> 10:53.580]  it became a phenomenon and then it flamed out and to the point where I
[10:53.980 --> 10:57.580]  Completely forgot the name of it here 15 years later, right?
[10:57.660 --> 11:04.380]  Whereas tech meme to me is as relevant as ever and has sort of been in it for the long haul
[11:05.580 --> 11:07.340]  yeah technorati
[11:07.340 --> 11:09.340]  I think they were
[11:09.340 --> 11:12.620]  they they had their big moment because they had a
[11:12.940 --> 11:14.940]  like when everyone realized
[11:14.940 --> 11:19.260]  Real-time search could do wonderful things because there were blogs
[11:20.060 --> 11:22.060]  and I guess
[11:22.620 --> 11:27.420]  I forget would people search blog posts there or just search links and see what's linking
[11:27.580 --> 11:31.660]  I I even forget what they did, but all I know is they index really quickly
[11:32.300 --> 11:37.840]  And google was not indexing really quickly at the time. And so the reason why technorati
[11:37.840 --> 11:40.880]  Interests dissipated is google eventually
[11:41.520 --> 11:44.400]  started indexing everything faster that and
[11:44.960 --> 11:49.680]  There was a lot of everyone sort of realized blogging would actually not continue growing
[11:50.460 --> 11:57.040]  Exponentially forever, especially when twitter came along a lot of the like short post bloggers just moved to twitter
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.640]  So technorati had both better technical competition and didn't have as much a reason to exist
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.400]  Why do you think tech meme of the properties which are all sort of based on the same platform, right?
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.040]  Yeah, and there's also media gazer, right which is sort of focused on
[12:13.920 --> 12:16.720]  Inside baseball in the media industry, right?
[12:17.280 --> 12:19.680]  They're clearly I mean correct me if i'm wrong
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.080]  But I mean i've just assumed by the way they look in the way they work that they're sort of built on the same
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.320]  Technical back end, right?
[12:26.480 --> 12:28.480]  It's just different
[12:28.480 --> 12:34.080]  Verticals as you said right obvious verticals that have preceded even the internet, right?
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.760]  Going back to the paper era. There was a section of the bookstore magazine rack for
[12:40.400 --> 12:44.400]  Computer magazines and there was maybe maybe not at the bookstore
[12:44.400 --> 12:49.840]  But there's always been a collection of inside the media publications, you know, that sort of thing
[12:49.840 --> 12:52.000]  Why do you think tech meme is the one?
[12:52.880 --> 12:54.320]  that
[12:54.320 --> 12:58.720]  Reverberated the most or are just is the most popular
[12:59.360 --> 13:02.240]  that's a good question because there's plenty of
[13:02.880 --> 13:06.240]  Interest in politics. I think maybe the the audience
[13:06.880 --> 13:10.000]  For tech news was just more receptive to
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.160]  This kind of nerdier presentation of news
[13:14.720 --> 13:16.720]  like hierarchy and grouping
[13:17.280 --> 13:22.480]  And maybe also they had more of a need to know because it's a little more
[13:22.480 --> 13:27.840]  For a business audience you're more willing to like compare coverage and you know, look through the related
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.800]  But i'm not entirely sure now for sure we've invested more in tech meme because it was the early breakout
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.160]  So it's not a fair comparison if we invested the same amount
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.200]  Like meme random the political one does still does not even have editors. So it's like
[13:43.760 --> 13:45.920]  It's like a demo of the algorithms
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.960]  So it's it's a little bit of a mystery
[13:48.960 --> 13:54.480]  But since tech meme pulled ahead that's been our biggest focus my spitball theory
[13:55.120 --> 13:56.320]  is
[13:56.320 --> 13:58.640]  Maybe technically minded nerds
[13:59.360 --> 14:05.200]  Are willing to look for something different it's like by definition because they're technical nerds
[14:05.200 --> 14:11.520]  they're willing to look for something like this and then be I think that as
[14:12.560 --> 14:18.000]  Polarizing as some things in technology can be mac versus windows android
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.280]  Windows android versus ios, etc, etc
[14:22.160 --> 14:24.160]  and none of that compares to
[14:24.880 --> 14:31.200]  The polarization we've seen in politics in real politics worldwide not really just in the u.s
[14:31.600 --> 14:33.600]  And that therefore political
[14:34.480 --> 14:35.900]  minded
[14:35.900 --> 14:37.520]  Enthusiasts people who are like, yes
[14:37.520 --> 14:44.000]  I am so interested in politics that I want to check on a more than once a day basis what's going on in the world
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.280]  of this
[14:45.280 --> 14:48.800]  But they're more I want to hear it from people on my side
[14:49.680 --> 14:50.800]  Techmeme
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.160]  Has none of that right? I like if I were teaching a course on
[14:54.780 --> 15:00.400]  Journalism I would hold up techmeme as a great definition of objectivity, right?
[15:00.800 --> 15:08.000]  Where it's just here's a list of all this stuff and there's an editorial voice declaring importance, but
[15:08.800 --> 15:10.800]  It really isn't imposing
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.560]  Using a view of the world of tech and
[15:16.400 --> 15:23.120]  I think that in politics as we become more polarized people say they want objective journalism
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.060]  But I don't think they do I think their behavior shows I think the continuing
[15:27.980 --> 15:34.400]  Success of fox news is proof that large numbers of people don't really want that, right?
[15:34.640 --> 15:38.960]  I well i'd love to throw fox news under the bus, but I don't even mean to throw them under the bus
[15:38.960 --> 15:41.200]  In particular here. I think it works on both sides
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.080]  yeah, we uh when we
[15:45.840 --> 15:47.440]  Highlight a story
[15:47.440 --> 15:51.540]  Where there are different like sharply different interpretations
[15:52.160 --> 15:54.160]  We will actively seek out
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.480]  Multiple views for the social post as long as they're out there
[15:58.960 --> 16:05.840]  So sometimes everyone basically has one view on social media. That's just part of doing our job because
[16:05.840 --> 16:11.280]  People who need to know what is going on here need to know that both those views exist and who's you know
[16:11.280 --> 16:14.880]  Voicing them and so on it. Yeah, it goes with our kind of
[16:15.440 --> 16:21.600]  role as sort of like a dashboard just like a place where you can get all the information rather than a place that you
[16:22.080 --> 16:24.320]  Go to because it makes you feel good about your team
[16:25.280 --> 16:32.080]  Right. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor of the episode new sponsor for the show ad block pro
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.440]  ad block pro so let's start off with some accolades ad block pro
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.080]  Has earned itself a spotlight by apple
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.040]  On the app store not once not twice but three times in the safari
[16:45.740 --> 16:49.920]  Extensions category and it is well deserved ad block pro
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.680]  Available right through at the app store is now supported on all platforms where it could apply
[16:55.680 --> 17:03.280]  iOS ipad os and mac os and it uses cloud kit for sync between platforms and has a
[17:04.160 --> 17:10.240]  Recently updated user interface that really really it just is so simple on all three platforms
[17:10.400 --> 17:17.760]  I know it can be very very confusing to choose a content blocker no matter which platform you're using or what browser
[17:17.920 --> 17:21.040]  There's so many and you wonder which one's the best or whatever
[17:21.040 --> 17:28.400]  However, ad block pro is undeniably one of the best. There's a reason why apple has highlighted it in the apple store at least three times
[17:28.960 --> 17:34.800]  What does it do? What does it offer you? You know those infuriating and to me and this is their word infuriating
[17:34.800 --> 17:42.800]  But let me underline it italicize it boldface it auto play videos deceptive little tiny x buttons to make things go away
[17:42.800 --> 17:50.580]  Relentless scrolling batters sketchy redirects wave them. Goodbye and welcome a decluttered and much more delightful
[17:50.940 --> 17:54.740]  faster browsing experience dive into a web realm
[17:55.220 --> 18:01.380]  That can be up to two to three times faster slashes your data usage by up to 60% and a bonus
[18:02.100 --> 18:04.980]  using less data having less stuff like
[18:05.460 --> 18:10.340]  stupid auto play videos that you never asked for that go in the sidebar and you don't even look at
[18:10.340 --> 18:17.780]  It slashes your data usage and that it reduces your battery life because your device whether it's your phone your ipad
[18:18.100 --> 18:19.780]  Your laptop whatever
[18:19.780 --> 18:25.780]  Isn't even downloading it and playing it and waiting for you to ignore it or click the stupid little x never even starts
[18:25.940 --> 18:29.140]  Therefore the battery life never even gets wasted. It really does
[18:29.940 --> 18:31.620]  affect your battery life
[18:31.620 --> 18:34.040]  Say no to sly trackers. They do anti-trackers
[18:34.040 --> 18:41.780]  Maintains the privacy of your online habits and for all the parents out there adblock pro ensures a safer

[18:58.500 --> 19:03.380]  comment sections on popular websites really that's a useful feature to

[19:33.320 --> 19:34.720]  Brady Bunch or something like that
[19:34.720 --> 19:42.820]  So my thanks to adblock pro for sponsoring the show jump to the App Store and just search for adblock pro to transform your Safari

[19:49.240 --> 19:52.600]  so let's parlay off a sponsor break there and talk about
[19:52.600 --> 19:59.200]  The ad model at tech me as different as daring fireball is from tech meme
[19:59.200 --> 20:05.240]  I have always felt that you and I right from when I first started monetizing daring fireball with
[20:05.720 --> 20:07.360]  Little banner ads on the side
[20:07.360 --> 20:13.520]  I've always felt you and I were aligned on that and I vaguely recall when you and I first met which I think was it
[20:13.640 --> 20:18.580]  Like an O'Reilly food camp back around like 2007 or something like that
[20:18.580 --> 20:25.140]  Huh in print? I don't know remember but I remember talking to you about it. How does tech me make money? So
[20:25.820 --> 20:32.380]  For most of the time we've made money indeed from ads and right there like sponsorships from people who?
[20:32.700 --> 20:34.320]  Like when they actually buy it
[20:34.320 --> 20:35.900]  They know our audience thing
[20:35.900 --> 20:42.260]  They know our site and they're making the buy because they want to reach that specific audience
[20:42.260 --> 20:44.020]  And that's what I think we have in common
[20:44.020 --> 20:51.140]  They're not using some platform and the impressions just go out on onto the internet. So
[20:51.980 --> 20:56.980]  We have a few different ad formats, but the main one is this sponsor post format
[20:56.980 --> 21:00.620]  It's sort of like a native format where you know how we have news headlines
[21:00.620 --> 21:07.180]  Well, we have sponsor headlines, but they're marked sponsors and they've been there. They've been there the whole time and
[21:07.980 --> 21:13.040]  Yeah, they've always been hopefully classy. They've never even been consumer ads for them
[21:13.040 --> 21:16.540]  I don't think we've really had anything consumer. It's usually like enterprise or
[21:17.060 --> 21:24.260]  Something reached something trying to reach like developers or people in tech. It's something that I'm proud of because
[21:24.920 --> 21:26.920]  Like we've never had
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.200]  mouseovers autoplay
[21:29.200 --> 21:33.820]  pop-ups anything like that, but it is still getting tougher like
[21:34.220 --> 21:41.660]  The platforms are just getting smarter and smarter and getting better at selling and our sponsors have to do a little work
[21:41.660 --> 21:46.060]  They have to write some copy specifically for tech meme if there's some friction there. So
[21:46.900 --> 21:52.220]  While that will will continue to have ads and we're always encouraging sponsors to reach out to us
[21:52.300 --> 21:55.700]  Like we've we've had to build other businesses as well
[21:55.700 --> 22:02.180]  And we were probably the biggest new business is in the the media monitor monitoring space
[22:02.420 --> 22:09.500]  Hmm, it's nothing we've really announced because right now we have a product that's really excels just for the biggest companies
[22:09.500 --> 22:16.180]  And so we just sell that directly. I feel like one way to that. I have an affinity for you is I
[22:17.260 --> 22:20.060]  Would say I have three types of sponsors at Derek fire
[22:20.260 --> 22:25.180]  but the biggest group by far thankfully is returning sponsors and
[22:26.060 --> 22:29.380]  Because they're returning it's they know what to do
[22:29.380 --> 22:33.260]  They're like, oh that was great or whether it was three months ago or six months ago
[22:33.260 --> 22:36.720]  Or sometimes people come back after a year-long break, but they're like
[22:36.720 --> 22:41.080]  Look, what do you have available in the fourth quarter? We'd love to come back
[22:41.080 --> 22:45.380]  We have a new thing coming out blah blah blah, but they don't need anything explained to them
[22:45.520 --> 22:51.240]  Then I have new sponsors who told usually it's like indie developers or something like that and they know it
[22:51.240 --> 22:54.800]  They've they're like, I'm a longtime daring fireball reader. I've always wanted to sponsor
[22:55.540 --> 23:02.040]  We've got a new app that does blank and we'd love to book an ad and again, I can just send them the specs
[23:02.040 --> 23:05.280]  They know exactly what to do and then the third group
[23:05.280 --> 23:07.280]  is
[23:07.640 --> 23:13.560]  When I get an email from like the marketing person at a company and the icon and whether they say it
[23:13.720 --> 23:16.520]  Explicitly or not. I know I can read between the lines
[23:16.520 --> 23:22.320]  But sometimes they just say it explicitly that somebody in the company said we should sponsor daring fireball
[23:22.760 --> 23:24.520]  yeah, and
[23:24.520 --> 23:31.360]  They ask me questions that are all answered on my daring fireball dotnet slash
[23:31.360 --> 23:38.880]  sponsors page but they and I know that's how they got to me but they still have questions because they don't understand because these ads
[23:38.880 --> 23:42.240]  are not like any other ads out there and
[23:43.320 --> 23:44.880]  my
[23:44.880 --> 23:52.160]  Little snippet that I have saved up in text expander to paste into an email with the details on the exact specs
[23:52.160 --> 23:58.920]  What dimensions exactly the in pixels the ads are how many words you should try to limit yourself to?
[23:58.920 --> 24:03.480]  They're nothing like the specs for other ads. They're not complicated
[24:03.480 --> 24:09.200]  If anything, I think the simplicity of it should make it easier. But the fact that it's so different is
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.600]  Sometimes hard for them to wrap their heads around. Do you run into the same thing?
[24:14.640 --> 24:19.280]  Yeah, it's the exact same all three categories are very familiar to me
[24:19.280 --> 24:24.440]  I think the funny thing about the the third type is often they speak like a different language. Yeah
[24:25.360 --> 24:28.160]  Sometimes they've used terms. I'm like, what does that mean? I go. Yeah
[24:28.160 --> 24:36.040]  Oh, yeah, okay, and then sometimes they'll send over the creative or the copy which is almost a little bit of industry term there
[24:36.040 --> 24:40.040]  But uh, like the text it'll be inside of a spreadsheet for some reason
[24:40.720 --> 24:44.480]  It's like some some other marketing thing. Yeah, I don't get it, but
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.040]  And then we copy it from the spreadsheet and put it on the website
[24:49.080 --> 24:50.760]  Whatever works for them
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.240]  It's in a Google Doc a lot of times from that group and I find that to be so
[24:55.240 --> 25:01.880]  Complicated we compared to just having it in the email to copy and paste from instead
[25:01.880 --> 25:09.360]  I have to click the Google Docs link. Make sure I'm logged into the right Google account and then copying out of Google Docs
[25:10.200 --> 25:16.080]  It's not complicated, but it's nowhere near as easy as copying out of an email it is
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.520]  I'm happy to have them as sponsors and I'm happy to walk them through it and I'm also happy that they often become
[25:24.520 --> 25:31.200]  Repeat sponsors and I always I often say in my little thank-you messages to sponsors that repeat sponsors
[25:31.520 --> 25:37.320]  To me are my proof that that my sponsorships work. Why else would so many sponsors come back?
[25:37.920 --> 25:44.560]  If not for the fact that they thought their original buy was worth it. It's it's a nice little
[25:45.640 --> 25:47.440]  Reassurance, it's a virtuous circle
[25:47.440 --> 25:55.480]  if you were you know that I I make money because they paid the bills and they they are happy with the number of people who
[25:55.480 --> 25:56.840]  came and
[25:56.840 --> 25:59.680]  Whatever bought their service looked at their app
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.920]  Whatever it is that they're after and they come back and hopefully the readers of my site
[26:05.020 --> 26:12.600]  appreciate that this is what keeps my site completely free of charge to read and is not annoying and doesn't tempt you to
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.440]  Block the ads or whatever
[26:15.440 --> 26:20.320]  But it is weird and I feel like my business is doing okay
[26:20.320 --> 26:22.680]  It's not growing like it was ten years ago
[26:22.680 --> 26:29.040]  But I I just worry though that as it becomes weirder and weirder compared to the state-of-the-art
[26:30.120 --> 26:32.840]  That eventually that's going to become a problem for me
[26:32.840 --> 26:40.960]  and I do you worry about that that it's the whole advertising world has become so dominated by the sort of
[26:41.520 --> 26:43.280]  Google Facebook
[26:43.280 --> 26:44.840]  duopoly of
[26:44.840 --> 26:46.480]  algorithmic buying
[26:46.480 --> 26:48.480]  based on
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.440]  Completely different criteria than us instead of targeting a publication
[26:52.520 --> 26:57.520]  They're targeting buckets of users based on whatever Facebook and Google's
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.520]  Descriptions are that it really is like you like you said when you when you get email from these people
[27:03.520 --> 27:06.360]  It is like they're speaking a different language and they use terms
[27:06.360 --> 27:12.440]  I'm not familiar with do you do you worry about that or do you feel like the fact that it stands out is actually a
[27:12.440 --> 27:13.800]  strength
[27:13.800 --> 27:16.440]  I do worry about it because it's a real factor
[27:16.840 --> 27:23.120]  I've noticed like there's there's certain segments of advertisers that only go to the platforms now
[27:23.440 --> 27:29.440]  But I do think the thing that's unique about sites like ours is they will always
[27:30.280 --> 27:36.080]  Hopefully for a long time get that first and second type of sponsor people who know our audience
[27:36.080 --> 27:39.440]  But you know, I gotta keep keep these changes in mind
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.320]  That's why we have this like media monitoring business and you for the longest time
[27:44.320 --> 27:50.200]  You've had a podcast and while that's still a sponsor model keeping that going that just adds a whole other dimension
[27:50.760 --> 27:58.600]  To it and makes the blog makes the podcast stronger and the podcast makes the blog stronger. Yeah, I hope so and
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.160]  Kind of walked into the podcast business that wasn't something I set out to do but I do think you're right that it
[28:06.160 --> 28:12.600]  it both strengthen each other and I can't quite explain why but I know that that they do and
[28:13.600 --> 28:15.600]  part of the reassurance is that
[28:16.120 --> 28:20.880]  Is just the emails I get from people who are like I listen to your show and I love your website
[28:20.920 --> 28:24.240]  blah blah blah or the sponsors who overlap and and
[28:24.560 --> 28:30.520]  sponsor both or something like that or that want to sponsor both to me is a good sign and that they
[28:30.640 --> 28:35.080]  I don't know that there are siblings that support the same overall
[28:35.080 --> 28:39.440]  Two two pillars in the same tent for lack of a better. Mm-hmm
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.180]  I don't know if that's a good analogy or not because I don't think I don't think a tent actually stands up with only two
[28:45.180 --> 28:49.200]  Pillars a two-legged stool is not a great stool, but that's what I've got
[28:50.480 --> 28:55.240]  Before we move on I want to I still want to talk a little more about the back end at tech meme
[28:56.520 --> 28:59.040]  Like how is the sort order?
[28:59.040 --> 29:04.960]  Like what's at the top? What's second? What's third? How is that determined and how often does it update?
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.480]  And if it's secret sauce say it's secret sauce
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.640]  I'm not looking for you to spill the beans on anything you consider proprietary, but I don't think you have to worry about
[29:14.520 --> 29:16.520]  Yeah, don't I don't have to worry about that
[29:17.360 --> 29:20.560]  nowadays and no one seems like nobody wants to
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.400]  Build this kind of aggregator anymore. That was different 15 years ago
[29:25.400 --> 29:31.360]  Yeah, so the biggest factor all along since the beginning has been
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.080]  basically citations links there is a
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.320]  relationship there with like page rank like
[29:39.120 --> 29:41.120]  The news stories that are getting the most
[29:42.080 --> 29:48.280]  Links are the ones that will shoot to the top and there's a time decay
[29:48.800 --> 29:51.760]  That'll bring them down again. But what you're saying is
[29:51.760 --> 29:58.640]  Roughly, the the more linked things in the past few hours now, there are a lot of caveats now
[29:59.280 --> 30:04.080]  suppose everyone's talking about some Microsoft story and they're linking to
[30:04.720 --> 30:11.040]  the Microsoft announcement maybe a press release maybe a Microsoft blog and then maybe some
[30:11.680 --> 30:13.680]  developer blog and now suppose
[30:14.240 --> 30:19.040]  We decide to just post the verge or tech crunch or something like that
[30:19.040 --> 30:25.200]  Just post the verge or tech crunch or some kind of blog to be the like the stand-in for all that news
[30:26.000 --> 30:30.240]  Then that the way our backend works now that blog post will
[30:30.960 --> 30:32.480]  still
[30:32.480 --> 30:34.000]  kind of get
[30:34.000 --> 30:38.880]  Get the lift that all the other blog posts are getting it'll be like transferred to that
[30:39.280 --> 30:41.440]  As far as how high it goes onto the page
[30:42.560 --> 30:47.760]  and and there are some other factors too because sometimes stories break and
[30:47.760 --> 30:51.760]  Fives new sites will cover it and none of them are the ones getting
[30:53.360 --> 30:59.040]  You know, they don't link to each other that generally doesn't happen anymore. And so we have to like
[31:00.320 --> 31:04.080]  You know the between the algorithms and the editors we have to pick one and then
[31:04.800 --> 31:08.800]  The how high it goes on the page has to sort of take into account the fact that
[31:09.600 --> 31:12.720]  Multiple sites are covering it even when
[31:12.720 --> 31:19.360]  Even when they're not linking to it's there's not like one article or blog post that everyone's linking to
[31:20.080 --> 31:21.360]  so
[31:21.360 --> 31:25.600]  I guess in the big picture. It's sort of like related to this original idea of
[31:26.240 --> 31:33.360]  What's linked to the most but then with a lot of ways that's been extended so in but in some sense it
[31:34.080 --> 31:36.160]  and i've always thought this and and I know it's
[31:36.720 --> 31:39.520]  you know, you've talked about it or written about it before but it is
[31:39.520 --> 31:41.140]  It is
[31:41.140 --> 31:42.340]  Vaguely
[31:42.340 --> 31:48.340]  like the original concept for page rank at google where it's other publications
[31:49.060 --> 31:54.180]  that you're you're monitoring through the rss feed or or other beans, which
[31:55.460 --> 31:58.340]  Hope put a tack in that we'll come back to RSS in a second
[31:58.900 --> 32:06.180]  But if you see that the verge's article is linking to a bloomberg original and
[32:07.380 --> 32:09.220]  It's a couple other
[32:09.220 --> 32:13.060]  Sites that you're monitoring are also linking to this bloomberg article
[32:13.780 --> 32:19.620]  That automatically promotes the bloomberg version of it in some way because it's hey
[32:20.500 --> 32:22.500]  we're monitoring these
[32:22.900 --> 32:24.180]  hundreds of
[32:24.180 --> 32:29.300]  Sources and a couple of them are all linking to the same original. Therefore that original
[32:29.860 --> 32:31.680]  gets some implicit
[32:31.680 --> 32:39.540]  credibility or importance because of that and I know that even in the early days of google like 1998 it it
[32:39.620 --> 32:46.900]  Wasn't quite so simplistic but at a high level it was the breakthrough that made google search better than other search engines
[32:47.460 --> 32:51.060]  And it's sort of like that at tech mean. Yeah, it's the
[32:51.700 --> 32:54.900]  That's that's like a core idea but like with a million qualifications
[32:56.580 --> 32:58.740]  With all those little things to account for
[32:58.740 --> 33:05.060]  Artifacts of the real world and then changes in media since everyone's reticent to link to each other
[33:05.700 --> 33:07.940]  But still though it drives me nuts
[33:09.380 --> 33:13.940]  The one thing I see less and less these days. It does seem like at some point in the last
[33:14.580 --> 33:16.820]  10 years the damn burst but
[33:17.540 --> 33:23.780]  It would drive me nuts in the first decade. Let's say the aughts like 2000 to 2010
[33:23.780 --> 33:30.420]  2010 when you could see that the new york times had a house style not to link to other
[33:31.200 --> 33:36.740]  competitors and even if they credited as as first reported by the washington post comma
[33:37.140 --> 33:41.940]  Blank blank blank and it wouldn't be a link. It would just be text in the article
[33:42.340 --> 33:49.380]  Like it was copy and pasted out of the cms. They were using only for their newspaper, right? Like it was like the cms
[33:49.380 --> 33:55.700]  Yes, and I know that it wasn't true their website was way too good to just be a copy and paste job from the print version
[33:55.780 --> 33:57.780]  And they would have links to other things
[33:58.020 --> 34:05.380]  But not to the other publication that they were crediting with as first reported by right as first reported by
[34:05.780 --> 34:13.140]  Is always in the news industry so clearly begrudging, right? It is like nobody types that phrase
[34:14.260 --> 34:16.260]  except through gritted teeth
[34:16.260 --> 34:19.160]  And therefore it makes their links so stingy
[34:20.020 --> 34:26.500]  Yeah that well, obviously we didn't like that either because there's not the metadata to to read in and and inform our algorithm
[34:26.820 --> 34:33.300]  Yeah, I don't know what brooke that damn. What was it? Was it the community of journalists and pressure peer pressure among among
[34:34.020 --> 34:38.580]  Those people or was or just readers demanded it because hey we're on the internet. Of course, you have to link
[34:39.300 --> 34:41.700]  I think it's sort of an age thing and that
[34:42.340 --> 34:44.340]  as the balance between
[34:44.340 --> 34:46.340]  people of the
[34:46.740 --> 34:51.860]  Well, right roughly my my age generation x people who grew up
[34:52.500 --> 34:55.060]  creating the web it became
[34:57.220 --> 35:03.140]  Natural for them to think of their publication as web first and so therefore of course
[35:03.780 --> 35:07.300]  This is going to have to be a link if we're going to mention the fact that so-and-so
[35:07.540 --> 35:11.700]  Reported this or broke the story. It should be a link to the actual thing that they reported
[35:11.700 --> 35:17.700]  Whereas the tail end of the boomer generation that's older than me, I think clearly
[35:18.980 --> 35:23.860]  Never it's a i'm making a sweeping generalization about an entire generation
[35:24.500 --> 35:27.860]  Of professionals, but I think that they clearly
[35:28.500 --> 35:35.460]  To me never ever gave the web the respect it was due they always felt that they were writing for a
[35:35.860 --> 35:39.380]  whether it was if it's a new york times for a printed newspaper or
[35:39.380 --> 35:45.140]  Printed magazine or whatever and that the web was a a weird
[35:45.940 --> 35:51.460]  Stepchild medium that to them didn't deserve the respect it was due and I you know
[35:51.460 --> 35:58.180]  I tried to guard against that myself personally, right? I'm not active on tik tok to name one for example
[35:58.500 --> 36:06.420]  But I respect it right and when I read that 18 to 29 year olds report that they get the majority of their news
[36:06.420 --> 36:09.140]  Or like world affairs news from tik tok
[36:09.780 --> 36:11.780]  It does make me roll my eyes
[36:11.860 --> 36:18.740]  But I feel like well it's a big pill to swallow but swallow it and deal with it because it I think it's obviously true
[36:18.740 --> 36:22.900]  And so what's the point of me being a car too curmudgeonly about it?
[36:24.100 --> 36:28.820]  Yeah, I think I think generational is a good explanation that maybe that was the biggest part of it
[36:29.220 --> 36:34.660]  It's kind of funny how though now on twitter. It's like we're moving backwards because of the internet
[36:34.660 --> 36:37.620]  It's like we're moving backwards because of the algorithm people
[36:38.660 --> 36:42.820]  Will refer to something on a news site and they just won't link to it
[36:42.820 --> 36:48.660]  They'll put a screenshot because the algorithm will ding link maybe 10 minutes later. They'll oh and by the way, here's the link
[36:52.500 --> 36:57.800]  All right, I mentioned putting a attack in rss I think the general consensus
[36:58.640 --> 37:00.640]  amongst people who care
[37:01.300 --> 37:03.620]  And who really know what rss?
[37:03.620 --> 37:05.540]  means
[37:05.540 --> 37:07.540]  Is that rss?
[37:07.840 --> 37:10.260]  exploded onto the scene in the early aughts
[37:11.300 --> 37:13.300]  and
[37:13.620 --> 37:15.140]  Was awesome
[37:15.140 --> 37:16.980]  for news junkies
[37:16.980 --> 37:19.460]  and then google reader
[37:20.100 --> 37:22.100]  came on to the scene and
[37:22.980 --> 37:24.180]  a
[37:24.180 --> 37:25.300]  added
[37:25.300 --> 37:31.620]  I I would think fair to say millions of users who before that hadn't been using rss at all b
[37:31.620 --> 37:32.980]  b
[37:32.980 --> 37:38.340]  Got millions of others to switch from whatever they were using before to google reader
[37:38.900 --> 37:40.900]  and then see
[37:41.700 --> 37:48.840]  I forget how official their api was and how much was they didn't care that it was backwards engineered
[37:49.460 --> 37:53.220]  I think I think it was sort of that they just looked the other way and they didn't care
[37:53.940 --> 37:55.920]  but the
[37:55.920 --> 38:04.420]  Effectively allowed third-party aggregators, uh, like net newswire at the time to use google reader as a sync engine
[38:04.900 --> 38:10.420]  So that you could subscribe to all your feeds in google reader and even if you didn't like their interface through the web
[38:11.060 --> 38:17.540]  You could use net newswire or a bunch of other feed readers on more than one device like your macbook and your iphone
[38:17.780 --> 38:20.580]  Or your work desktop and your home
[38:21.100 --> 38:22.340]  macintosh
[38:22.340 --> 38:26.020]  And sync the red and unread status of all your feeds
[38:27.060 --> 38:32.740]  And then when google pulled the plug on google reader unceremoniously and just said have this google reader thing
[38:32.820 --> 38:36.420]  We're just going to drop it and very quickly. They just pulled the plug and it went away
[38:37.140 --> 38:43.220]  that it effectively pulled the plug on rss for users and that was that and I mean and that was like
[38:44.020 --> 38:46.580]  15 years ago. I mean that's a long time ago
[38:46.580 --> 38:52.420]  Do you I think that's true. I think everything I said there is true, but I kind of also think
[38:52.900 --> 39:00.020]  That even if google it stuck with google reader something like that was going to happen. Anyway, I don't think rss as a thriving
[39:00.660 --> 39:05.540]  This is the first primary way people are going to follow. The news was long for the world
[39:05.540 --> 39:09.380]  Anyway, I think it was a utopian ideal, but it wasn't going to work
[39:10.100 --> 39:15.540]  Because of the way shithead media executives think about protecting their content
[39:15.540 --> 39:23.220]  It has to be frustrating for you because when rss was more thriving it had to make tech memes job easier on the back end
[39:23.540 --> 39:28.740]  Because you had good content to pull through rss, which was already pre-structured data
[39:29.140 --> 39:35.300]  Yeah, it was definitely great when a lot of sites actually put all their text in the rss feed
[39:35.460 --> 39:39.140]  It simplified the crawling but even when they didn't do that
[39:39.140 --> 39:47.460]  It still helped because if they have a snippet we would at least by checking the rss feed know that new posts have appeared
[39:48.020 --> 39:55.540]  And then send a bot to fill in the rest and now a lot of sites don't even include that kind of feed
[39:55.860 --> 39:57.940]  That's been tougher. We have to make a
[39:58.740 --> 40:03.940]  Scraper basically for home pages to find like what are the new links that have appeared there?
[40:03.940 --> 40:11.380]  So the decline is cause all kinds of problems, but the nice thing is I think there's still enough pressure
[40:12.180 --> 40:16.820]  That like most of the sites well a lot of sites still have it
[40:17.380 --> 40:24.580]  I guess there's just enough users who complain and maybe news sites some of the bigger ones begrudgingly add
[40:25.140 --> 40:30.420]  Feeds with little snippets just to keep the most news addicted readers happy
[40:30.420 --> 40:35.540]  A lot of whom are probably bloggers and reporters at other sites who are more likely to link as well
[40:35.540 --> 40:38.900]  So the nice thing between that and also
[40:40.100 --> 40:43.620]  Companies like automatic just continuing to
[40:44.500 --> 40:49.300]  Include feeds by default in wordpress blogs. I think it's going to
[40:49.940 --> 40:53.380]  continue in a form that will be helpful, but will
[40:53.380 --> 41:00.420]  Continue in a form that will be helpful, but will fall short of the dream that everyone had
[41:01.060 --> 41:03.060]  For rss. Yeah
[41:03.060 --> 41:07.620]  yeah, I think tumblr has full feeds by default too, which is owned by automatic and
[41:08.260 --> 41:11.940]  defaults really matter a lot and and I know that
[41:12.560 --> 41:13.920]  wordpress
[41:13.920 --> 41:15.600]  continues to have
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.440]  ridiculous stats for what percentage
[41:18.440 --> 41:25.640]  Of the entire web if you just go by domain is powered by wordpress behind the scenes and
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.600]  The fact that they do include rss by default and you have to take some kind of action to disable it. Yeah, that's great
[41:33.400 --> 41:35.400]  makes a difference but
[41:36.040 --> 41:42.920]  It's almost obvious. I almost feel silly asking but yes, in other words much much of what techmeme does is
[41:43.620 --> 41:45.560]  web page crawling
[41:45.560 --> 41:47.560]  and
[41:47.560 --> 41:55.080]  Uh scraping of the html of websites to sort of parse out the actual content of articles
[41:55.720 --> 42:01.560]  Yeah. Yeah, we we've had to do that for the longest time and it gets it gets trickier too because
[42:02.120 --> 42:04.920]  Thanks to ai and ai models
[42:06.200 --> 42:13.400]  More and more sites are just let's just block all the bots is their approach and let's hire cloudflare to force
[42:13.400 --> 42:17.500]  Captchas and it's just it's getting tougher and tougher
[42:17.500 --> 42:21.420]  Fortunately, like if you're if you're a big news site you start blocking techmeme's crawler
[42:22.140 --> 42:24.140]  the good news is sometimes
[42:24.220 --> 42:28.460]  You're big enough to have a team where when I email and say hey
[42:29.100 --> 42:34.780]  You're blocking us. We want to link to you more. Can you please let her crawl her in? They'll say oh, yeah. Yeah
[42:35.340 --> 42:39.180]  Sometimes it takes three weeks to make that decision. Sometimes it takes a day
[42:39.180 --> 42:42.940]  but we sometimes get that result but not always and then
[42:43.500 --> 42:46.060]  Sometimes we have to find other ways to crawl
[42:46.540 --> 42:53.500]  It's a mess and I don't like the trend but we're hanging in there. It's been true since the web was
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.420]  Obscure when it was still hey, have you heard of this thing called mosaic? Oh,
[43:00.460 --> 43:04.780]  Yeah. Yeah, that looks it's kind of cool or no. No, what's that? And it's like, oh
[43:04.780 --> 43:11.260]  It's a way to get on the internet other than through a terminal window and it's like what but ever, you know from the
[43:11.820 --> 43:13.820]  the beginning onward
[43:13.880 --> 43:20.380]  scraping html programmatically has always been a problem and there was a sort of
[43:22.600 --> 43:28.940]  Delightful heyday in the very early aughts where the sort of web standards
[43:28.940 --> 43:34.300]  Jeffrey Zeldman spearheaded I think sort of hey, let's as professionals
[43:35.180 --> 43:38.540]  Be proud of the fact that our websites are actually written through
[43:39.260 --> 43:42.060]  proper html that you can run through
[43:42.940 --> 43:46.060]  A syntax checker and we'll say yes. This is actually
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  syntactically correct html
[43:49.820 --> 43:54.780]  Even at the heyday of that movement which coincides with like the early years of daring fireball
[43:54.860 --> 43:57.580]  And I think the early years of tech meme it was still
[43:57.580 --> 44:01.180]  A very few number of websites that could possibly run through
[44:01.900 --> 44:06.620]  Like the w3c syntax checker and actually come out with a green check mark
[44:07.660 --> 44:10.300]  Famously difficult famously, you know
[44:11.180 --> 44:13.660]  There be dragons when you start to parse
[44:14.600 --> 44:16.700]  html programmatically and you know
[44:17.820 --> 44:21.740]  I love everybody who not everybody but people who know my own
[44:21.740 --> 44:27.820]  Programming skills know that I have a weird knack for writing regular expressions
[44:27.980 --> 44:32.460]  It's just I I'm like a savant at it and famously
[44:33.180 --> 44:36.860]  people are tempted to use regular expressions to parse html and they're like
[44:37.020 --> 44:42.380]  Hey, don't parse html on your own b do not do it with regular expressions c
[44:43.820 --> 44:49.740]  Repeat a and b just don't do it one thing I have found I don't need to scrape but I I wrote
[44:49.740 --> 44:52.940]  a couple of shortcuts for ios
[44:53.580 --> 44:59.020]  And one of them is a way that I make little notes to myself with the title of a put like here's a post
[44:59.020 --> 45:03.580]  I might want to link to from daring fireball, but only when i'm back on my mac
[45:03.980 --> 45:08.700]  I want to send it to my notes app with just the title of the page in the url
[45:08.940 --> 45:11.980]  And save it in this same note put the new one at the top
[45:11.980 --> 45:14.620]  So I when I go to it the newest things are at the top
[45:14.620 --> 45:20.700]  And just getting the title of the web page from shortcuts is actually very easy if
[45:21.340 --> 45:23.180]  web pages actually
[45:23.180 --> 45:25.100]  had a title tag
[45:25.100 --> 45:30.780]  But it it is remarkable how many web pages and and of cms's
[45:31.660 --> 45:33.500]  have like
[45:33.500 --> 45:39.980]  Dozens or like titles for every article and that's it html like simple simple
[45:39.980 --> 45:46.140]  html is not complicated lay people can easily be taught the basics of
[45:47.180 --> 45:52.460]  Html tags and the title is it's by definition. There's one per page
[45:52.460 --> 45:56.460]  it is a thing that goes in the header of the html, but
[45:57.100 --> 46:03.100]  At this point because my little shortcut when it says get the title if there's more than one it presents them in a list
[46:03.900 --> 46:07.580]  And it's surprise. It's it's like the majority of web pages
[46:07.580 --> 46:09.820]  have more than one title, which is
[46:10.620 --> 46:14.940]  So semantically incorrect that I don't even know where to start. I cannot believe that anybody
[46:15.980 --> 46:21.980]  would do this and yet I and I think it's I just bring it up as one example among probably
[46:23.260 --> 46:27.420]  Thousands that that your scraper must have to handle. Yeah
[46:28.300 --> 46:32.300]  Seen a lot of stuff over the years like even from the beginning even in the aughts
[46:32.540 --> 46:34.540]  We needed to handle some javascript
[46:34.540 --> 46:40.940]  Some dynamic code like maybe to put the date but now nowadays there are some like some new sites you'll go to
[46:41.660 --> 46:43.500]  They're not serving
[46:43.500 --> 46:49.500]  Html, they're serving like json and some javascript is assembling the page right and so
[46:50.140 --> 46:52.140]  You can't call that with something that reads
[46:52.280 --> 46:59.420]  Html for a while. I was over time slowly building like kind of like a a browser that I just kept adding stuff to it
[46:59.420 --> 47:06.460]  Okay, like I like i'll interpret this new css tag because I need to know when something's bold because those titles are bold
[47:06.700 --> 47:08.700]  I kept adding to it and adding to it
[47:09.020 --> 47:09.980]  and
[47:09.980 --> 47:15.100]  So I had my little shadow browser running inside the tech me back in over time, but at some point
[47:15.660 --> 47:22.860]  I just gave up and for some sites just have to use a browser because of all the dynamic stuff and I think
[47:23.420 --> 47:24.860]  guessing google
[47:24.860 --> 47:26.060]  Does that too?
[47:26.060 --> 47:31.740]  Yeah, you have to use it to get the text. So in in other words the back end has to have an actual
[47:32.140 --> 47:38.220]  Real web browser involved at a certain point to run things through the browser first and then
[47:39.100 --> 47:41.100]  parse the
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.500]  Computed rendered page that the browser is presenting
[47:46.220 --> 47:49.500]  Right chrome chrome is nice about that chrome has a an option
[47:49.820 --> 47:52.700]  you can run from the command line and dump the dom and then
[47:52.700 --> 47:58.140]  Parse that uh using your html parser. That's andy. I hope chromium keeps getting those updates
[47:58.380 --> 48:03.740]  Yeah, I hope so too and I feel like it probably will because I feel like you said google itself probably uses it
[48:03.820 --> 48:07.660]  And it's not the sort of thing that they have to worry about. Oh
[48:08.300 --> 48:11.740]  But what if the whole world starts using chrome from the command line?
[48:11.900 --> 48:16.140]  Is no the whole world normal people are did it would never even occur to them to do it?
[48:16.140 --> 48:20.940]  It's not any kind of threat to the traffic they're getting to their app. So it's not like they have to worry about it
[48:20.940 --> 48:26.220]  The traffic they're getting to their actual consumer properties their special sauce is way
[48:26.860 --> 48:32.780]  It goes way beyond their crawler. I mean their crawling is i'm sure some top notch technology there, but
[48:33.420 --> 48:37.100]  There's so much to google. They're they're fine. And also they get access
[48:37.420 --> 48:41.420]  No one blocks google if if you want google to if you want to appear in google
[48:41.500 --> 48:44.940]  You're going to make sure google can crawl you and you can just as well block
[48:45.500 --> 48:46.780]  every other
[48:46.780 --> 48:51.260]  Type of crawler out there and and it won't hurt you and then that'll hurt me
[48:51.980 --> 48:53.980]  And that's when i'll send that email
[48:56.460 --> 49:01.280]  All right, let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at memberful
[49:02.280 --> 49:07.580]  Memberful is a way that if you have your own online property or brand
[49:08.140 --> 49:13.260]  Or whatever you have an audience and you would like to offer a membership system
[49:13.260 --> 49:18.860]  To your audience memberful is the way to go and you're crazy
[49:18.860 --> 49:26.700]  If you don't start by at least looking at it memberful you always a have full control and ownership of your audience and your brand
[49:26.780 --> 49:29.900]  So if you ever do want to move on to something else something custom made
[49:30.380 --> 49:36.620]  You take your audience with you you get the full list of subscribers the payments always go through your stripe account
[49:36.780 --> 49:40.620]  So you could just move as they couldn't make it easier
[49:40.620 --> 49:46.700]  To move if you wanted to but you won't want to I don't even know anybody who started with memberful
[49:46.700 --> 49:51.180]  Has moved on they make it easy because they're so confident in their service that you won't want to
[49:51.580 --> 49:52.220]  They make it easy
[49:52.220 --> 49:58.060]  But it gives you that peace of mind that you're building your brand and you're still in control of it
[49:58.300 --> 50:02.540]  They fade in the background memberful so that your business is front and center
[50:02.540 --> 50:09.980]  Your your members probably won't even know that memberful is in between that's how seamless it is and they integrate with all of them
[50:09.980 --> 50:14.460]  They integrate with all of the tools you already use including services like MailChimp
[50:15.100 --> 50:19.340]  WordPress which Gabe and I mentioned Stripe, Discord and more
[50:19.500 --> 50:25.980]  These are all your accounts you plug into your accounts and they they just connect to your accounts at those services
[50:26.060 --> 50:28.380]  But so for things like Discord
[50:29.180 --> 50:34.700]  They make it so that you can run a members only Discord through their system
[50:34.940 --> 50:38.780]  Which is if that's what you want to do. You don't have to set it up yourself
[50:38.780 --> 50:45.020]  They handle the integration on their own. It's really great. Everything you need to run a membership program goes through memberful
[50:45.420 --> 50:47.420]  they've got analytics and they've got
[50:47.740 --> 50:49.740]  absolutely great tech support and
[50:50.220 --> 50:55.820]  Almost consulting advice where they know what works for other successful membership systems
[50:56.300 --> 51:02.780]  And they can help steer you and answer your questions for how you should set up yours to be successful because they know what works
[51:02.780 --> 51:10.300]  And what doesn't absolutely terrific I subscribe to at least half a dozen memberful sites things like six colors
[51:10.540 --> 51:17.260]  Relay.fm a bunch of them and I just love it. I'm a happy happy happy subscriber to so many memberful sites
[51:18.140 --> 51:21.020]  It's great as a user. It would be great as a creator
[51:21.580 --> 51:26.220]  So get started for free at memberful if you want to no credit card required
[51:26.780 --> 51:28.960]  Just go to memberful.com
[51:28.960 --> 51:31.780]  Memberful.com slash talk show that's memberful.com
[51:33.600 --> 51:38.560]  Slash talk show and monetize your passion with member memberful
[51:39.760 --> 51:44.080]  All right, RSS we kind of touched on there and the decline of it
[51:45.040 --> 51:47.280]  Has been it's irritating to me
[51:47.840 --> 51:54.560]  But to me the biggest bane of my existence at daring fireball and it must be for you, too
[51:55.040 --> 51:57.040]  Is the rise of paywalls?
[51:57.040 --> 51:58.960]  I mean, do you agree?
[51:58.960 --> 52:02.240]  Yeah, and I and I totally get it. This is not a complaint
[52:03.040 --> 52:10.180]  About the decision. It's just a complaint about the experience in a lot of reading scenarios
[52:10.880 --> 52:14.480]  And of course in a web crawling scenario once again
[52:15.200 --> 52:17.200]  a lot of big publishers have been
[52:18.000 --> 52:24.080]  Kind enough to approve our crawler so that helps and another nice thing even when they haven't
[52:24.080 --> 52:26.960]  Like we haven't talked to them because so many
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.320]  Publishers have like a trial
[52:31.040 --> 52:37.200]  Option like you know, like a meter paywall that won't put the wall up until you've visited so many times
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.160]  It turns out those are easy to crawl
[52:40.960 --> 52:45.780]  You in most in most cases, right? So if you've already got a programmatic scraper
[52:46.720 --> 52:51.360]  It's kind of easy to tell it to delete the cache
[52:51.360 --> 52:56.880]  of cookies for the new york times every 20 visits or or whatever
[52:56.960 --> 53:03.360]  I mean, I would hold the tile I mentioned the times because they're obviously a major source of news across all fields
[53:03.920 --> 53:05.920]  And I also feel that
[53:06.320 --> 53:11.520]  That the way they've implemented their paywall is about as good and friendly
[53:12.080 --> 53:16.420]  To everybody as it could be where they have a generous allotment
[53:16.420 --> 53:20.660]  Of free page views a month for people who don't pay
[53:21.380 --> 53:28.280]  They've got enough content and you know, and they publicly held company and they announced their numbers. They are pretty successfully
[53:28.960 --> 53:35.140]  Navigating the shift from print to web, right? I mean print the writing's been on
[53:35.140 --> 53:39.060]  I mean i've i've known it since the web was created instantly. I knew
[53:39.620 --> 53:42.980]  Print was going to be killed off. I just didn't know how long it would take
[53:43.540 --> 53:45.540]  But a lot of other sites
[53:45.540 --> 53:47.540]  Are not so friendly
[53:49.380 --> 53:52.820]  I would say bloomberg is a good example of a site that is to me
[53:53.380 --> 53:56.900]  Kind of hostile even as and I pay for a bloomberg subscription
[53:56.980 --> 54:00.180]  This is one good measurement of how hostile a paywall is
[54:00.580 --> 54:07.620]  Is how annoying it is to be an honest paying subscriber in if you're still frequently logged out which I am at bloomberg
[54:07.780 --> 54:12.260]  Very frequently, that's a paddling you should go to the principal's office and get spanked
[54:12.980 --> 54:14.980]  Yeah, bloomberg is tough
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.400]  for
[54:16.400 --> 54:19.620]  Subscribers the experience could be much better
[54:19.700 --> 54:25.300]  I'm a subscriber too. I think the last time I logged in I needed to complete a capture if I recall correctly
[54:25.300 --> 54:32.740]  Yeah, I think but one nice thing about bloomberg is they too have I think it's very limited but still some kind of metered
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.180]  Situation where you can see a page like one article maybe yeah
[54:38.180 --> 54:45.540]  And you guys have and going back to technorati and the concept of leaderboards you guys do publish
[54:45.840 --> 54:48.260]  leaderboards in various rankings
[54:49.520 --> 54:50.660]  Bloomberg
[54:50.660 --> 54:57.700]  To me is an outlier at least amongst people who know who I am and listen to this podcast know that I have a particular
[54:58.400 --> 55:04.280]  obsession with with their big hack story from 2020 and their refusal
[55:04.280 --> 55:09.480]  To absolute steadfast refusal to acknowledge that they botched it on it
[55:09.480 --> 55:16.360]  and so I love to bring it up as frequently as I can with a footnote when they're reporting on unrelated things, but
[55:17.640 --> 55:24.680]  Sometimes people ask me right they know that I love to bring that up and they're like why even link to them in the first
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.600]  pace instead of linking to them with this footnote that brings up this
[55:28.600 --> 55:35.480]  Story that you're highly critical of why not just not link to them and my answer is they're too good not to right
[55:35.480 --> 55:37.480]  They're a bizarre to me
[55:38.360 --> 55:42.440]  News culture, but they are a scoop machine by design
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.680]  Yeah, it's it's they're they're so far ahead of other
[55:49.480 --> 55:54.920]  business publications and and publishing stuff that like you where you need to
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.320]  Link to them if you want to if you want to know to report it first
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.800]  It's definitely like more in the long tail
[56:01.800 --> 56:09.480]  I don't think they show up so much in the links that like mass audiences are linking to on social media to complain about
[56:10.200 --> 56:16.840]  Politicians they hate or whatever. It's just more like in all these nice industries they they're
[56:17.560 --> 56:18.680]  reporting
[56:18.680 --> 56:24.840]  Lots of little things first and it adds up to so many so many links
[56:24.840 --> 56:26.840]  So yeah, they're at the top of our leaderboard
[56:27.560 --> 56:33.640]  I'm starting to build this little community on discord where we share a number of like feeds useful for
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.760]  People in different scenarios and one of the one type of feed we have is if you're a publisher
[56:38.760 --> 56:45.880]  you can see when other tech sites are linking to your work and the volume of Bloomberg there is just so
[56:45.880 --> 56:53.720]  It's so high compared to all the other publishers. It's an outlier, right? I think part of it is and i've mentioned this and I do
[56:55.160 --> 57:00.360]  I I guess I am critical of it because I think it's a worrisome practice and no one's ever denied it
[57:00.760 --> 57:06.760]  So i'm about as sure that it's true as could possibly be and i've spoken to people who've confirmed it off the record
[57:06.760 --> 57:08.760]  but that they have a
[57:08.760 --> 57:16.760]  Bonus structure within the company that as a reporter at bloomberg your bonus is tied to
[57:17.400 --> 57:19.800]  The the number of times throughout the year
[57:19.800 --> 57:25.240]  I don't know if it's an annual bonus or quarterly or how often they pay it but that you get a financial bonus
[57:25.800 --> 57:31.720]  For quote-unquote market moving news. So if you're writing again, obviously my sphere of interest is off
[57:31.880 --> 57:35.720]  obviously often apple centric and if you post something about apple and
[57:35.720 --> 57:39.000]  Immediately after posting it their stock goes down
[57:39.640 --> 57:46.520]  2.37 percent or something like that you get paid a bonus for that whether it goes up or down and and the well
[57:46.520 --> 57:48.520]  Why do they pay that way?
[57:48.520 --> 57:54.680]  It's obvious because they're the main way they make money is by selling bloomberg terminal access
[57:55.160 --> 58:00.680]  And bloomberg terminals are insanely expensive there. I forget. I think it's like 20 000 a year
[58:00.680 --> 58:06.680]  Per seat to start and that you can't even get one. You can't even if you want to pay the money
[58:06.680 --> 58:08.680]  You can't just say here
[58:08.680 --> 58:13.400]  Here's twenty thousand dollars. Give me a bloomberg terminal for the next year. You still have to get approved
[58:14.280 --> 58:23.640]  Which is bizarre, but the idea and I think it's actually true is that bloomberg publishes their own original reporting through the terminal
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.120]  First with I think about a 15 minute window
[58:26.120 --> 58:32.440]  And so if you subscribe to the bloomberg terminal, you have the opportunity to read bloomberg's original reporting
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.100]  15 minutes before the rest of the world sees it on bloomberg.com
[58:37.640 --> 58:44.200]  And if you think this news is very good or very bad for the company being reported on
[58:45.000 --> 58:52.680]  You have this window of opportunity to trade their stock accordingly that others don't have and that's the reason why
[58:52.680 --> 59:01.720]  Bloomberg terminal subscriptions and therefore the they need original reporting that is market moving news and therefore there's this
[59:02.600 --> 59:09.400]  Motivation for their reporters to contextualize what they're reporting in market moving ways
[59:09.640 --> 59:11.640]  Which I think is often
[59:11.640 --> 59:13.640]  To me sensational
[59:13.640 --> 59:15.640]  Yeah, it's something
[59:15.640 --> 59:17.960]  I've looked at with that lens. So
[59:17.960 --> 59:22.440]  At all, I I can't give an informed view on this, but I can see how
[59:23.160 --> 59:24.520]  that way of
[59:24.520 --> 59:29.640]  motivating their reporters leads to both producing good work that needs to be cited and
[59:30.200 --> 59:32.760]  Also tempting them to distort things
[59:33.400 --> 59:35.240]  I guess with all in all
[59:35.240 --> 59:40.360]  Not in management who said it like you start measuring one thing you have to like come up with a measure for the opposite thing
[59:40.360 --> 59:42.360]  Because it's going to be abused
[59:42.360 --> 59:44.360]  Yeah, we're working on it
[59:44.360 --> 59:52.200]  You know, I guess is good advice. I do know and for example, and again just the intersection of
[59:52.760 --> 59:55.480]  Daring fireball bloomberg and tech meme
[59:56.360 --> 59:57.800]  mark german
[59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.640]  Who like I forget how many years now he's been on the apple beat at bloomberg
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:10.120]  But came to bloomberg from nine to five mac where he was writing as a teenager and kind of
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:16.120]  I mean to to say that he was precocious is it's hard to imagine how he could have been much younger
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:23.000]  When he first started writing for nine to five mac and getting these scores, but on the tech meme leaderboard
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:30.040]  Gurman was off the charts near the top for like the apple related sphere
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:36.280]  And I I I think that tech memes actual ranking was a little bit different
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.360]  I I I think that tech memes actual ranking of it
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:47.720]  I think people even if tech meme didn't exist or tech meme didn't publish that leaderboard. I think it was pretty obvious german's
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.120]  unique stature
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.280]  Covering apple and he might have likely
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.880]  been made an offer from bloomberg anyway, but uh
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.960]  I've heard that that was part of what led them to say we've got to hire this kid because look at how
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.440]  Influential he is in this world about this company
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.440]  That is a humongous and b
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.400]  people care about
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.160]  And he's still there right? He's
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.960]  Incredibly, you know bloomberg itself overall is very influential at tech memes leaderboards
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.880]  But german in particular as a reporter in the tech sphere is way near the top deservedly. So
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.480]  Yeah, I haven't heard that but I I know he's been he's always been very tech meme aware and sometimes we talk about it as
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.400]  references tech meme would
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:37.080]  Spill into twitter and he wasn't shy about that and and I you know, by the way, I know mark
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.880]  Uh, not super well, but I I see him at events and stuff
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.600]  I I remember meeting him once when he was he was that teenager
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.360]  Yeah, he's uh, he's probably he's probably still at the top of our author leaderboard
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.320]  yeah, so our leaderboards are like
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.920]  well, there's a whole history with uh of them and it's it's probably like can get a little boring but
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.200]  One way we can be helpful to a lot of companies
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:06.840]  and comms people in particular in companies is to provide lists of um, the reporters who basically
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.760]  dominate that area or or are prominent in certain spaces like ai or
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.840]  Security or apple or whatever. So we used to have this general leaderboard
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:21.880]  but we like who's on tech meme the most but
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:29.880]  Ultimately, that wasn't too too helpful because there's just a lot of reasons posts end up on tech meme that aren't necessarily
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:37.880]  Aligned with having scoops or being like thought leaders exactly if you're fast to important stories that also helps you get on tech meme
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.600]  Yeah, but anyway once we introduce all these leaderboards on different topics that you know
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.640]  That's actually a helpful product for a lot of people and uh when you look at any of these reports
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:53.960]  It's not the exact order that matters like, you know, number one versus number three usually isn't too meaningful
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.960]  It's just like if you look at the top
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.800]  20
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.240]  You'll probably have some good ideas of people to reach out to if you want to pitch some
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.880]  Whatever new social network or something
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.640]  Let me just take a break out and and then we'll we'll hit the finish line
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:16.040]  But let me take a break right there and i'll thank our third and final sponsor of the episode and it's our long-term sponsor
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:21.880]  Long-term sponsor our very good friends at squarespace. You guys know squarespace. It is the all-in-one
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.120]  platform for publishing on the web
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.080]  Lord only knows how many squarespace sites are out there that I have linked to over the years
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:35.160]  It is just a wonderful wonderful platform that handles
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.740]  Literally everything you need to create your own presence online everything from domain name registration
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.440]  to picking a template
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.080]  But from hundreds of templates you can choose from that are all professionally designed
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:57.020]  Look great on everything from a phone to a giant studio display and everything in between and that you can customize
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.920]  out
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.440]  as as little or as much as you want through a
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:06.200]  totally visual drag and drop interface or
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:12.680]  Through html css javascript if you want to and you know how to actually write code
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.240]  And want to do it on your own you could do it that way or you could do it visually their new
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:22.760]  Fluid engine which is their name for the new wizzy wig editor that most people use
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:28.760]  uh is the their best way of doing it that they've ever had and the big big difference between
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.800]  What they call the fluid engine and this the engine they had before is that the fluid engine?
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.440]  Works absolutely great
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:44.440]  Even on the phone a touchscreen little tiny touchscreen display you can actually drag and drop to design a website right there
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:50.360]  Which is let's face it the phone is the primary computer for a growing growing number of people
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:57.000]  And as I always always love to reiterate when squarespace sponsors the show, it's not just for you
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.600]  The nerd is listening to the talk show with john gruber who might want to build a website with squarespace
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.240]  But it's the people who come to you and say hey
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.240]  nerd
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:11.960]  I need a website or I have an old website that I want to update. Where should I go to do it?
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:18.600]  Tell them squarespace first give them the url from here and they'll even if they don't listen to the show
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.620]  They'll still i'll still get credit for it, which is all I want go to squarespace.com
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.980]  Slash talk show squarespace.com
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.000]  talk show and
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:36.440]  By going to that website first they get or you if you sign up get ten percent off your first purchase of a domain
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.760]  Or a website using that code. So why even care about giving my custom version of their thing?
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.740]  Well, they save ten percent so I get credit for it. They save ten percent squarespace.com
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320]  talk show
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.360]  All right
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:57.640]  I feel like this is a big topic, which is why I wanted to get the the third sponsor spot out of the way, but
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.560]  to me
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.540]  the other factor in RSS's demise
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.160]  other than google reader
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:08.840]  Having the plug sort of unceremoniously pulled out of it
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.840]  It could be you can't prove it without somehow having an alternate
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.400]  multiverse where
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.720]  google reader still existed but
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.600]  Looking back on it
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.960]  the decline of RSS and the decline of
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.440]  Plain old-fashioned blogging coincides with the rise of twitter
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.480]  and to me it's
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.440]  It would be a very hard argument to make that they're not
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.840]  Related. I mean we could get into the we have a lot to talk about with twitter
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.880]  But i'm curious whether at first whether you saw the rise of twitter and tweeting
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.280]  as helpful
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:50.120]  to tech memes purpose or a hindrance
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.440]  Yeah, there's a lot a lot to look at there. I mean, it's both. It's always both
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.440]  twitter definitely
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.320]  I'm convinced it was it was the biggest factor in blogging's decline
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.160]  You can just look at the people who their posts went down as their tweets went up
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:10.600]  There's so many bloggers and apparently not all of them probably not you but maybe I don't know
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.880]  Maybe some of your quick posts became tweets. I guess we didn't really do much about twitter for the first
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:22.200]  Year or two. Well very early on we were posting to twitter because I got that people wanted to see tech meme headlines
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.640]  So we were doing that one in march, uh, 2007
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.360]  but at some point
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.120]  The next thing to do is to see what people are linking to on twitter
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.760]  Because when people are linking to less on blogs and linking to more on twitter
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:43.480]  Then you got to get those links from twitter to to feed into our algorithm and so we found some ways to do that
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:49.640]  Fortunately when it comes to like informing a news algorithm for an industry niche like tech meme does
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:55.240]  You don't actually need like the fire hose. You don't need this massive access to what's going on
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:02.760]  In twitter, you just need a smart slice of twitter. So we did that fairly early on and it helped us
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.840]  but you know, it would have been better like in some hypothetical world where
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.560]  Everyone just kept blogging and it just got a little more real time like
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:17.640]  You know, maybe rss aggregators found a way to just get the post instantly and apps made it super easy
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.640]  So that twitter never had a wedge. I mean that would be a superior world for
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:28.680]  Tech meme and I guess mastodon and federated open source approaches now are
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:37.960]  Reviving that promise but a lot more a lot more things need to fall in place before we begin to see that reach even like
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:45.480]  Five percent of where it could go. It's like in some ways twitter as originally conceived is one of the
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:53.400]  To me great accomplishments of the entire world wide web and I still think the basic idea is because it was
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.440]  Democratizing to posting your own
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.520]  Stuff on the web which I think was central to the concept of the world wide web
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:10.120]  It was discovered. Yeah, it was a natural natural thing waiting to be discovered. I've often
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.760]  revisited this idea
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.760]  of user interfaces
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.520]  friction and that reducing friction
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:20.520]  is
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.960]  vastly overlooked as something that should be
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:32.120]  Strived for in design to make things as frictionless as possible because it's just good a it's just better
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.960]  Like an interface that feels like you don't have to fight it that is actually helping you accomplish that whatever it is
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:45.720]  Is good for you the user and so therefore a sort of design priority that makes users happy is
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.080]  In and of itself a good thing
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:55.640]  But it also makes it more popular and makes it useful people stick with things with less friction, but I do think
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.680]  Twitter is so friction
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.680]  free that
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:08.280]  Blogging almost couldn't compete with it right like however easy wordpress made it to
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.840]  Post a new blog post once you've set up your blog in wordpress
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440]  Making a new post it's
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.080]  There's a little bit more inherent friction
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:25.640]  Even if you only have two fields in your cms title and then content
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.800]  That's versus twitter where it's just one field. It's just a box what's happening and you just type in the box
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.480]  and
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.680]  On the one hand that's worse because titles are useful semantic content
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:43.720]  But it's better in terms of friction and the less friction
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.640]  It just people end up going that way
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.880]  I do think I think you're right that I even me who has a website
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.440]  That has supported
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:05.480]  Short form link posts where the primary purpose is here's the primary link from what i'm linking to is to this article
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:13.480]  At the verge or at six colors or wherever else and here's a quote from the article and here's my two cents
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.280]  Or my thoughts about why i'm linking to it
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:23.000]  I think i've done it less there were times at like the peak of my twitter usage maybe midway through the teens
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.120]  Where it kind of occurred to me like hey
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.400]  I should be posting this on my website first and just if it's going to be on twitter let it go through
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.360]  The at daring fireball account. I should not be tweeting so much from at gruber
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.480]  I should be putting it on my website and but it's like even me who has a website that supported it
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:49.800]  I was doing it less because it was easier and the pressure was lower, right? I think my tweets are mostly
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:58.600]  Grammatically correct and well punctuated and whatever just because i'm old-fashioned that way but it still feels like less
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.600]  It always felt like less pressure
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:09.800]  Let alone the fact that most publications don't have a format for their reporters to post
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.360]  The equivalent of a link post so therefore if they couldn't you can't go through
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.200]  Bloomberg or the new york times or the wall street journal if you work there full-time
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.600]  There's no equivalent of my link post
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:26.280]  So if you're a reporter for them and you have something you want to link out you could do it on twitter or not at all
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.840]  And so they did it on twitter. Yeah
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.600]  And I think where it really worked and I think the way that tech meme for
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.680]  I forget when you started doing it, but it's I I don't remember when you didn't but let's just say there's a
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:49.080]  The top story of the day is some report from the verge about topic x and then there's a bunch of links from
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.680]  A bunch of other sites that are linking about the same thing
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:58.040]  And then there's a section underneath that'll say twitter or I guess now I guess it's x
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.560]  Colon and then there might be dozens sometimes
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:08.520]  Several dozen tweets that are all linked under the same article in tech meme and
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.120]  You don't even have to open them all in little tabs because they're tweets
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.200]  You could just hover if you're on a desktop computer
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:20.040]  You can just hover the mouse over them and the hover text will show you the whole tweet because tweets are little
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:26.760]  and in that sense tweets haven't competed with blogging per se but but they
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.000]  completely
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.520]  Usurped the comments that used to be per post and were per cms and therefore were off in their own universe
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:45.240]  It's like a universal commenting platform, which in theory is great. And I think it was good for tech meme. Is that how you see
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.480]  Tweets overall in the tech meme context as sort of the universal comment platform
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.240]  They usually have a comment type function when they're on the same page
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:03.560]  Comment type function when they're on tech meme and uh, they aren't comments that we you know own
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.280]  So if you see a good tweet on tech meme
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.880]  You don't share the tech meme link once in a while a tweet will also be the news headline doesn't happen too often
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.720]  You know, usually if we wait five minutes
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:19.400]  We'll get a post from a blog that just adds more context and that that'll be preferable
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.280]  But sometimes sometimes sweet to the news as well
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:28.840]  Yeah, yeah, you see it with like in my sphere like minchi quo or somebody like that will sometimes tweet something that is big news
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.760]  But then sooner rather than later somebody like mac rumors or somebody is going to have an actual article
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.720]  That's more of a canonical source for the news
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.760]  yeah explains where it fits in a
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.040]  Little bit of history a little bit of context and even for an industry audience that's preferable
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.480]  To link to as our top headline in most cases
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.240]  How do you see
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.320]  the arc of
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.320]  Twitter over the years
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:02.520]  I know that's sort of an open-ended question, but i'm curious because I feel like your perspective on it is
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.600]  if not representative of the twitter user base overall, it's representative of
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:15.480]  My audience's view of twitter as a sort of aggregator of news and a state of source
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.120]  So even before
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:24.700]  Elon musk took over people referred to it as the hell site so there were all these dynamics that were corrosive
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.120]  and it made people feel bad to go there and so on but
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.080]  I didn't think of it that way and I I didn't experience that for me
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.520]  It really was that hive brain that attracted a lot of people
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:37.960]  who
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.960]  Had smart things to say about the news often in a fun fun way
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.800]  It was really powerful and we needed
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440]  Tweets to complete the picture
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.960]  And for on tech meme and so it was important to include those tweets and crawl them
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.720]  If there's a headline on tech meme, we were using the api to like find
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.880]  Tweets that link to it so that we could recommend them to our editors to add to the site
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.400]  And that's how a bunch of tweets would appear over the year
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:13.160]  So it it just seemed to get more and more important, but that has crested because of something that happened last year
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.040]  And it's not just because we stopped using their api
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.920]  I guess we could use their api again if we paid a lot of money and rebuilt it
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:28.440]  But it just doesn't seem worth it to us people with good contacts added to news really are starting to leave twitter
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.160]  And it's still got maybe more than half of what it had but uh, it's missing a lot
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:38.760]  And it's and it's dispersing. It's not unfortunately. It's not in one. Well, maybe fortunately it's not in just
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.680]  Some in one new social network. You gotta you gotta
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.960]  Go to threads for for some of this you got to go to mastodon for some of it
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:52.440]  Linkedin will have some of it and that's that also is reflected on tech meme. It's kind of ridiculous
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.600]  Now you'll look under some of the the bigger
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:58.840]  News headlines and there'll be sections for linkedin blue skies
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:05.400]  Threads mastodon. Yeah, I just did
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:13.880]  I I looked I computed something right before I got on with on this podcast and I guess in october
[01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:16.420]  2022 we had
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440]  7031 tweets
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.600]  On tech mean throughout the month and now in october 2023
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.600]  5036 so, you know, it's it's down 30%
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.360]  It's down 30
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.200]  It's down but not out but a lot more threads a lot more linkedin
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.680]  a lot more mastodon
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:41.000]  Well, it's got to be all new threads because threads didn't exist in october 22, right? Yeah and and blue sky
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:47.720]  my basic theory and I think it's true is that twitter suffered under
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.560]  The way that
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.660]  The market for publicly held companies works where being profitable
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:05.960]  Alone and sustainable isn't isn't enough that you it's viewed as a failure to be anything less than
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.720]  the leader or appear amongst the leaders and
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:20.360]  in the apple context and I think it's I think it's a useful analogy but like in then especially the late 90s like when the
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:25.960]  When apple acquired next and the steve jobs regime from next came in and took over
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:27.720]  apple
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.920]  You know had I don't know five percent market share or something like that or depending on where you measured it or at least
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:39.880]  In the us they did and it was a good five percent market share because they all even back then sold more expensive computers
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.560]  than other companies
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:49.080]  But they were essentially considered in the business press a complete failure because microsoft and intel were so much bigger and the the
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.960]  drumbeat was they apple should just do what microsoft does and when that was
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:02.520]  microsoft makes billions where apple makes millions because microsoft licenses their os to pc makers therefore apple
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.320]  Should license their operating system and then eventually apple is like fine
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:13.880]  We'll do it and they license these clone makers and I I know it is like the of all the things apple has ever done
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.360]  Since the two steves were in a garage
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.920]  The weirdest period of apple was the period where there were macintosh clones
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.360]  I think I think for people younger people who didn't live through it
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:31.240]  I really think it's it people would think that it was a prank and that you've photoshopped the articles about these companies that did it
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:37.400]  And one of the first things steve jobs did when he came back and became the ico was just cancelled uncertain
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.680]  Just said you know what this is terrible. It's killing us. We're going to get rid of it
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:46.600]  But the basic idea was just look this company is so much bigger than you that's what they're doing
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:52.360]  You should do it too. And then in the twitter context, it's the comparison to facebook, right? facebook
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.960]  Is so much bigger than twitter ever could have been
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.680]  and the basic
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:06.360]  And the idea is well, they're both social networks where you go and post things. So therefore
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.200]  twitter's measuring stick was always against facebook
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.800]  and
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.600]  It wasn't enough for twitter to just let it be what it was going to be
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:23.260]  Because they were being measured against facebook. They tried things that I think were contrary
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:29.960]  To what twitter should have been and it was to the detriment of the site and then it only
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:36.460]  Well, once musk took over a year ago that was out the door because now all of a sudden instead of answering to shareholders
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.480]  They're they're answering to one shareholder, right?
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.800]  So everything changed when he took over but up until that point
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:49.560]  I think the reason twitter was even available to be taken over was the fact that they sort of
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:54.920]  Flailed in that comparison. I was thinking about it today in my post about this
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:21:01.640]  I was thinking about it today in my post about this coyote versus acme movie that
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.480]  time warner
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.080]  Had commissioned a complete major motion picture with a 90 million dollar budget a major star
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:16.840]  John cena a fantastic premise where the idea is that wiley coyote from the bugs bunny cartoons is suing the acme
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:21.820]  Corporation who sold him all of these gadgets he used through the years to try to catch the roadrunner
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.300]  And it's sort of a roger rabbit sort of live action slash animation thing
[01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:32.540]  And that they decided for tax purposes to just never release this finished movie
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:39.900]  Because the david zaslav the ceo just somehow this somebody did the math and said it would actually be better for us
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:43.340]  financially to just shelve this movie and never release it
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.500]  And it made me think of this quote from walt disney
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:53.980]  Probably close to 100 years ago at this point, but at least like 80 years ago, but the quote is we don't we disney
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.060]  don't make
[01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:03.260]  Movies to make money we make money so we can make more movies right disney was in the content business
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:09.340]  And first as a priority and they wanted to be profitable doing so so they could keep doing it. Whereas
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:15.100]  Obviously anybody who's the ceo of a movie studio who would be willing
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:21.740]  Be willing to do what they've done with this coyote versus acme movie has their priorities the other way around
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.300]  And I kind of feel like you and I
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:30.940]  Are simpatico in in this regard like I don't run daring fireball to be the most profitable thing imaginable
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.380]  I i'm glad it is profitable. I'm glad I make a living at it
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.980]  I'm, very gratified
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.620]  But my goal has always been I want to this is what I want to write. I want to write these weird long
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:44.960]  5 000 word articles reviewing a new iphone
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  That would never be able to run
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.960]  At that length anywhere else and also post weird little 50 word links
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.120]  and
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.120]  If I make a good living then that's good enough
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.080]  And I feel like tech meme has always been like that too
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.920]  Like you have a vision for what tech means serves and the point isn't how do you make the most money?
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.520]  The point is how do you make money at all to keep it afloat while you're doing it?
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.560]  Would you agree with that? Uh, just I mean to some extent
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:17.280]  I always would like to make more money as it turns out but well, I I mean
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.440]  I'm with you there
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.320]  but
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.440]  for sure
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.960]  There were hills
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.680]  We could have attempted to climb which would have been the wrong hills to climb
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:35.280]  And part of that reason is because it would make tech meme crappier for its readers in ways that you're talking about here
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:41.120]  I think we did see the same with twitter like they wanted to get impressions and maybe they should have come up with some
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.480]  Api access scheme. I mean, I don't know exactly what
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.440]  What would have been optimal for them, but it's too late for that now
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.400]  yeah, I like
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400]  quality of experiences
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:59.600]  It and maintaining it in the face of so much change is important for us
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.240]  I'm, also hoping that that'll unlock your business opportunities. That'll make things
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800]  More lucrative so I can
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.360]  Pay all our editors more money
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.040]  Well, let me just put it this way as as an admitted daily reader of tech me
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.320]  For as long as I can remember tech mean existing so at this point 20 years give or take
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.040]  I can't remember tech meme
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.840]  ever once getting worse
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:32.800]  It's evolved over the years and it has changed but I can't remember any time where it's oh this changed at tech meme
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.120]  That's kind of I see why they did it. It's to make more money, but blank. Oh now you can only
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.880]  See three times a day and then it cuts you off and asks for you to subscribe like you can only
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.120]  There's no now there's a paywall just to read tech me or something like that and it's never once happened
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.660]  And I think it's because you're prioritized
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.540]  First yes, you it is a very important priority for the company to be profitable
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.120]  and sustainable going forward in the face of all this change in the media world, but
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  Never more important than well, let's just make sure it stays great for our readers
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.120]  yeah, happy to hear that and I
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.000]  I hope it's true for everyone and it's something we work to uphold
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.760]  I putting myself on the back now. Yeah. Well, let me pat you on it. I'll do the back patting for you
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.600]  It is a great resource, but the Twitter format to me
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:38.160]  It's genius in its simplicity, right that you just pick people to follow and everybody can just pull at the top
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:43.760]  For a decade or two 140 characters, but you've got this severely limited character count
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760]  per quote post
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840]  And out of that limit
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.800]  Necessity is the mother in invention. It made people creative and there are
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.680]  a lot of people
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.880]  who
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.680]  Aren't you know, you see it when you get emails from them, right?
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:05.520]  Most emails would be so much better off if they had the same character constraints as Twitter
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.560]  And everybody out there knows the people who you're either your colleagues or people at other companies that you deal with
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.400]  other companies that you deal with
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.000]  who
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.360]  send
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:24.500]  Emails that you have to scroll to read the whole thing and that should have been tweet length and so mandating that length on everybody
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:31.680]  A was a great benefit, but b it just gave people a platform that they wouldn't have and yes in a way
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:39.360]  It's this massive trade-off where it didn't kill blogging but it greatly reduced blogging still exists and blogging is still great
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.960]  It's obviously
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.120]  Far less common as a practice than it was at its peak which was pre-twitter
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.840]  But on the whole more people are posting more of their thoughts
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.720]  post 2006 because of twitter
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.440]  and now twitter-like things but
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:01.040]  I've seen this frustration in my personal usage, right? I I use all of them
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.440]  I have i'm on still on twitter x whatever you want to call it. I'm on threads and really like it
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.360]  I've been on mastadon for years, but really got active on it
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:18.800]  Once musk took over twitter last year and i've been on blue sky since I got in the invitation system at some point
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.040]  It is
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:23.040]  Though as a just as a user
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.340]  mentally
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:31.120]  Exhausting to keep up with more than one of these services. It was so much easier
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.960]  when the only twitter-like thing that I cared about was twitter itself and
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:45.360]  Now that there are multiple twitter-like things that I do care about and want to keep up keep up with in some regard
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  each additional one
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.960]  Like multiplies the mental
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:58.000]  Exhaustion I feel of having to keep up with them and i'm curious for you because you
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.320]  You you guys keep track of all of them as a source for commentary on your articles. Do you?
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.120]  Do you think it's?
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:13.600]  Is it better for tech meme and or the world at large that there's sort of
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.480]  Fragmentation in this card and we're not we're not dependent on just one
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:23.540]  Source twitter or is it worse overall because now there's fragmentation
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  Sorry, i'm one of these people who will say it's both
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.020]  But it's yeah, it's definitely from a user perspective
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.520]  It's usually if if you're going for completeness, it's it's harder and it's more annoying
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.080]  Uh, you have to check multiple things
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:44.160]  Fortunately, if if it's a story on tech meme, you can look under tech meme and see our roundup and hopefully that's good
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.160]  But you know in general for keeping up with what's happening on social networks
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:55.440]  Like there are a bunch you have to use and and I do do that. Like I I still go to twitter for like my war news
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.520]  and ai tweeters and then I go to
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.320]  threads for kind of like the tech
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:06.880]  pundits for a lot of tech pundits now and then a little bit of mastadon and blue sky on the tech
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:12.400]  What is as far as what it means for tech name? It's maybe it's like a little bit of a moat I guess
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:15.200]  But it's not like we have competitors in what we do
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.400]  This past year the amount of stuff
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.840]  We needed to build has been daunting like we're using all we're using blue sky apis
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.840]  We're using mastadon apis
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.120]  And i'm really hoping
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:37.120]  To tie all this together is there's this promise of federation if threads actually hooks up to activity pub then
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.560]  Threads and mastadon will in some ways be one thing and you'll be able to get your threads
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.000]  posts on mastadon and tech meme will be able to
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:52.800]  Crawl threads posts in an automatic way through mastadon apis and it'll go both ways and it'll be great
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.240]  I just hope facebook doesn't find a reason to say actually never mind
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.040]  Right right now threads has no api at all which is
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:11.280]  Not surprising at all as a facebook property because I think facebook has had some sort of api in the past
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:16.880]  But in general over the length of the company, they just have not been api driven and therefore
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.560]  as opposed to twitter which
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.760]  Part of you know, the musk era the first major controversy under his ownership was
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.280]  him
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:35.680]  Cutting off the api that third-party apps could use like tweetbot and twitterrific and those things were instead of using twitter as your app
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:39.520]  as a user you could use these third-party things and they
[01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:47.200]  Long before musk took over for the early years. They loved those third parties and they got you know
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.240]  Talking to craig hockenberry at the icon factory. He was a personal friend of mine and twitterrific
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.600]  Was the first major third-party client for twitter and gave them like
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:06.080]  The word tweet was invented by the icon factory not twitter and the idea that the logo would be a bird came from the
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:12.080]  Twitterrific bird not twitter itself twitter itself had a just a lowercase t is their logo
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:17.520]  Before that's how you know, and it wasn't that I don't think the icon factory feels ripped off
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.680]  I feel like they thought you know, they were
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.920]  Sort of partners in it and took it as a badge of honor that they influenced the course of the company so much
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:33.600]  But then long before musk took over twitter more or less just came out and said hey don't make a new third-party client for us
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:37.120]  We're sort of and and they put like user caps on the ones that existed
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.320]  because of
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.080]  because of
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.560]  Effectively business reasons, you know that they thought
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:52.240]  We we want to do ads in a way that we don't want to or our vision for how to deliver ads doesn't work with an api
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:57.440]  Therefore we need people to use our client and if they have to use our client, we don't want third-party clients
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:31:59.600]  wobble
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.720]  that's
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.760]  totally different with mastadon, which is
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:11.620]  Is truly built in the spirit of the open web right where and they actually even in the good ways have things like documentation
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.860]  So, yeah, it's not just that their api is stable
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:22.580]  And that you don't have to piss off a central authority to use it, but they actually document it and the documentation is correct
[01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:30.980]  And it works and there are you can get get the posts from a mastadon user via rss and the rss is actually valid rss
[01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:33.300]  It's so great. I I was like
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:36.900]  literally excited and I liked
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:42.340]  tweeted about it and intruded about it when when I just saw how easy these
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:50.420]  Apis were and how and how open they are you can just take any mastadon post url and you you like tweak the url
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.540]  Little you put something before the number and and it's json
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.640]  Yeah, that's the the data right there that you don't need to be authenticated
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.860]  There's other stuff you can do without authentication
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.200]  and
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:08.680]  The like the limits are generous. It's maybe if if mastadon becomes really big maybe they'll have to find ways to
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:16.280]  To cut back in some ways just to make just so these servers can function or maybe to cut off forms of abuse
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:21.960]  But it's reassuring that underneath it all there's like a philosophy. There's like an open source
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:26.360]  Not for profit philosophy behind all this because you know, they're not going to go
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.320]  in
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:33.880]  In the kinds of directions that led to all these great twitter experiences being destroyed. Yeah, I know i've
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.800]  I couldn't click the heart icon under your posts often enough on threads, but
[01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:45.000]  I forget his title, but the the the head of threads at instagram is adam
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:54.600]  who's also comes from instagram where he's also the lead and they even say and they've said since threads launched that it's an instagram
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:34:00.440]  Not a meta app and it looks it it shares visual dna with instagram
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.560]  and
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:05.560]  They adam and
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:14.200]  zuckerberg himself are active participants on threads and I know that there are cynical people who think that because they are major
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.720]  Executives at this company that they actually don't that it's not them
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:22.280]  It's some kind of social media team at meta who does all these posts, but it's not
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.160]  I mean, maybe there's somebody in comms at meta who can post as
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.080]  Zuck
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:36.040]  But i'm not sure there is i'm not sure that anything that's ever been posted by at zuck on threads isn't actually from mark
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:37.880]  zuckerberg's thumbs
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:43.880]  And I know adam is personally very very active on threads personally, but he asked
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.720]  Hey, we're moving as fast as we can we've gotten a lot of low-hanging fruit. We're moving fast
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:55.480]  What are the most important things that we can do and as next steps to keep moving forward and you've hosted?
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:58.120]  api api api
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.600]  Yeah, I talked about apis so much that I changed my bio at some point to say i'm the guy who complains about apis
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:11.240]  Yeah, their api situation is is I mean there's you can talk about apis
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  Endpoints that would be nice to have on twitter. You can talk about the ones that
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:21.240]  Twitter used to have and then lost but you could you can still post to twitter. You can't even post
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:30.200]  Right now the threats there's no api even for posting and that's crazy, right in some ways. Yeah, and um,
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:34.920]  It yeah, it seems crazy to me that any kind of microblogging
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:41.880]  Anything that had an aspiration to be a microblogging service would would even for a while talk about
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.520]  Not having that api I get like launching without it fine, but you should at least say
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.520]  That you plan to add an api for posting and yeah, I get it
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:58.520]  They they're not like super excited about having you know news content all over threads, but so many kinds of twitter-like posts
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.440]  and
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.800]  memes and and pieces of content that start conversations on twitter originate through
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:11.880]  Pieces of content that start conversations on twitter originate through at least a posting api
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.360]  You don't have to give like I don't actually
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.080]  I don't mind that they're not building
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:23.560]  An api that will enable a kind of tweet deck or right alternate reading
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.200]  Type app because as long as they do this, uh activity pub hookup
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.080]  We'll get that eventually but right now
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.640]  I would like
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:39.240]  Uh api for posting and it was very good to see them change what they were saying on that
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.840]  I could it's kind of like there are a few people who work for threads and
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.040]  They talk pretty openly they post pretty openly about stuff that doesn't look like it's approved by
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:51.560]  By comms I noticed ahead of their announcement
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:57.320]  There are a few more likes from some of those people on my posts about apis and like that's interesting
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.240]  But i'm not going to like call them out
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.840]  Just wonder what's going on here
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:08.200]  And then yeah a few days later. I got these people were like at name had mentioning. Hey, they just announced that posting api is coming
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.320]  I do the same thing with apple folks sometimes where somebody who I know works at apple
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.360]  Will favorite something I posted on one of these services or jump into the thread with a reply
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.120]  and
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.040]  Yeah, you know it's public and you've posted it, but I will often not
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:32.120]  Even if it is sometimes I would just say yeah, you know, i'm not gonna link to their tweet on daring fireball
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:38.520]  Because I don't want to bring the eye of saron upon them inside cupertino for jumping into this. It's there
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:44.360]  People can find it and i'm so glad they're jumping into this but I don't want to bring undue attention to it
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.200]  And I could I think you're saying the same sort of thing with these api
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.080]  Advocates within meta. I think the other thing and I mentioned this earlier my basic theory that twitter
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:57.720]  Was corrupted by its
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.720]  Investors forcing them expecting them to be facebook size
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:12.040]  With a concept for a site that never was going to be facebook sized right facebook is a trillion dollar idea
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:18.680]  And twitter is a billion dollar idea and there's nothing wrong with having a billion dollar idea
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.440]  Unless your expectation is hey you need to be a thousand times bigger
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.640]  The advantage threads has is if they're never as big as
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.880]  Instagram or as the blue app that facebook is which I think is true
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.480]  I think threads could thrive over the next 10 years
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:45.480]  And will probably never be close to as popular or as lucrative as instagram
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:51.560]  And probably not the blue app, but that's fine because they own it and they don't need it
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:54.200]  To be right in a sense. There is free
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.320]  not free of charge, but as free as in freedom as
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:05.000]  Mastodon, even though threads is not open source or a community project, but there it's free
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:09.640]  It must be freeing for them that zuckerberg has said. Okay, let's do this
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.040]  Instagram
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:15.080]  Moseri you're in charge of it. Let's get this built quickly
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:22.520]  Get this built quickly, but simply with the goal of being a in zuckerberg's words
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.320]  Let's get to a billion users and then we'll figure out how to monetize it. But let's just effectively
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:33.000]  Let's just kill twitter if we can and that's all they need to do and it's incredibly freeing that they don't
[01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:39.980]  There's no expectation zuckerberg's mission isn't you have to build something that's going to be bigger and more profitable than instagram
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:44.620]  It's just I want you to build something that's bigger and more popular than x
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.060]  Yeah
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:53.020]  I hope they have a reason to sustain it if it's only a small fraction of instagram revenue. They're a business
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.900]  They're good at making money and finding new ways of making money
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:59.820]  and there I think there are ways to make money out of
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:01.660]  threads
[01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:04.540]  type app that we just haven't imagined yet, but
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:08.140]  Uh, hi
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:14.380]  It's i'm optimistic, but I i'm ready i'm prepared for every anything
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:17.260]  I'm ready for them saying we're not even doing
[01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.300]  Activity pub. I hope it doesn't get to that
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:24.540]  But like a lot of people just roll their eyes at the idea that they're going to federate
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.540]  I've seen that since the day they launched where there are people
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:36.220]  Who are so cynical about meta that they're like this there's no way this is ever going to happen, but I have
[01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:39.500]  I've come around and have a much more
[01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.180]  Open mind towards meta and their products than I had
[01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:47.180]  before last year and I part of it is
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.780]  Just changing my mind about things in the past
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:55.820]  That they've done and part of it too is that I think they've changed, you know
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:03.020]  And I think that's one of those things that is very hard for anything but a founder led company to do is to grow
[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:07.500]  to a humongous size and yet remain nimble enough to
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:14.540]  Keep adapting to the world as the world evolves and I I think meta is a better company
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:21.820]  Ethically speaking than they were five years ago and there just seemed to me to be a lot of people
[01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.460]  Who?
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.780]  I don't know what the word is, but they lack
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:35.020]  the grace to even think about forgiving a company or even if you're not asking for forgiveness, but just to
[01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:41.980]  Accept that hey, they used to do blank which was morally questionable and now they don't do it anymore
[01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:46.380]  Can you ever move past that or are you always going to hold against them?
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:50.620]  Whatever it is that you think they did wrong during the 2020 election or whatever it was
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:58.140]  Yeah, I mean I perceive some of those changes and it's evident like you alluded to in
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.940]  posts from
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:05.980]  Executives and lower-level product people on threads itself. Yeah
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:12.540]  I think they will do the activity pub thing and I get why it might be complicated for them
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:16.300]  But the idea I think the way that it would work would be
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:23.900]  That you can be a mastadon user on mastadon social or whatever of the thousands of mastadon servers are out there
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.220]  And if you would like to follow gabe revera
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:29.420]  as a thread user
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:35.980]  Without you being on threads but follow from your mastadon account. You'll just you follow at
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:42.300]  Gabe at threads.net or well, I don't know what is your username at threads? I forget
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.780]  It is gabe revera gabe revera. So follow at gabe revera at threads.net
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:53.980]  And all of a sudden your threads posts come in the way they would if threads were a mastadon server
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:43:01.360]  And you can just follow along from your mastadon account and get gabes or at grouber at mastadon.socials
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:08.060]  Or at grouber at threads.net. It'll be a question for people like me and you who use
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:13.100]  Both where do I stop posting on threads and just post on mastadon and assume people will follow it
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:19.420]  There's questions about that, but I don't think to me. There's no question that them implementing it in that way
[01:43:20.220 --> 01:43:26.540]  Will not hurt the overall number of people who go to threads.net and use the official threads app
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:31.020]  I I really don't I don't think it'll decrease that I think it only
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:36.060]  Strengthened would will and would only strengthen the way that it would if it were to go to threads.net
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:39.180]  And would will and would only strengthen their position
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:44.380]  As a sort of canonical source for people's short form posting on the web
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.660]  I think so because already they're much bigger
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:50.380]  than mastadon and
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:52.380]  people
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.200]  It's a reason to post more on threads knowing that mastadon
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:59.900]  Users can also see you like, you know mastadon's really strong in
[01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:07.660]  Like areas like security a lot of security people because they're if you're a security person you're not posting on mastadon or threads yet
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.940]  You you'll know that you can
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:15.660]  Just by posting on threads if you start doing so
[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:21.420]  After federation those security people on mastadon will be able to get your posts
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:28.140]  I think it helps threads and meta in in numerous ways. I hope they continue to be a
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.780]  I hope they continue to be convinced by that
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:34.620]  Where where do you see x go?
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:40.060]  And where what do you think of the the year one under elon's leadership?
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:42.940]  It's it's pretty bad
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:50.220]  in the areas that I care about a lot of people just aren't posting as much or gone entirely and that's not good and
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.460]  the reasons are kind of
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.180]  There are simple reasons and more complicated reasons for that
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:45:02.460]  but I just sense like elon musk there are certain aspects of twitter that he just doesn't get and he doesn't
[01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:07.260]  Realize he's destroying a lot of it. You know, there are parts that are i'm sure
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:11.740]  Are being bolstered by his approach, but they're not
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:18.940]  I don't think they're great parts and I don't think they have a great chance of sustaining themselves forever
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:23.900]  I think it's hurt him tremendously that he's
[01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.900]  He's almost
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:31.840]  Universally is regarded as an executive who does not want to be told no by his employees
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:36.140]  And therefore has seemingly surrounded himself by yes men
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:43.340]  and his other companies are you know, tesla is obviously very successful and growing spacex is a
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.580]  remarkably successful company, I mean they've they've truly pushed
[01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:53.500]  Rocket science actually, you know, the the go-to metaphor for big brain smart people
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.080]  Has been pushed forward by spacex
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.700]  and and they're therefore their success has masked that I think over the years because
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:08.460]  He can maybe push through something like I think a questionable design for the cyber truck
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:11.100]  Oh, I think let's say that's an open question
[01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:16.780]  But the gull wing design for the the model what I think it was the model y or the model y
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:21.980]  Or the model I forget which one of the models it was but that had the stupid doors that open up from the top
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:28.940]  It was pushed forward by him and people said that's a bad design boss and they got fired or just blown past
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:35.900]  But overall tesla continues to grow and tesla owners are overall pretty happy, but I think with twitter
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.540]  He's wrong about so many things
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.500]  and like you said just tech meme, which is not
[01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:45.980]  Truly, I think has no pro or or anti-bias against twitter
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:51.660]  But you can measure it and before he took over there were seven thousand links and now there's five thousand for the same month
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:55.900]  A year later and that's a pretty significant decline not a collapse
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:02.140]  But that's a sign of fading influence and there's just so many people I follow
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:04.780]  who have
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:12.220]  Officially announced. Hey, i'm done posting over here on x i'm over on threads or on mastadon or i'm on both
[01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:18.460]  But the hell with this place and then I think there's a lot more people who are more like me where i've never said i'm done
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:20.540]  posting on twitter
[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:26.780]  I I just do it less because it's just lower in my ranking of which apps I check and sometimes I don't get to it
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:30.220]  Yeah, yeah, it's definitely lower for me. It's
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.940]  I mainly tweet
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:35.100]  like self-promotion and
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:38.780]  Just a few occasional housekeeping things
[01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:45.740]  And I don't think he understands the role twitter plays right and I can't think of a better example
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:49.660]  And it looks like they've reverted it literally like in the last this week
[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:56.220]  but that they changed the link format like when you post a link to not contain the
[01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:03.040]  The headline of the article so I could say here's a link at the verge.com slash. Here's the url
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:10.780]  And then the link will contain the verges headline so that people can read it and I can write my commentary in the tweet with
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:15.020]  Snark or just a summary or hey, I think this is real. I did not expect this or whatever
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:20.860]  I paste the url and then the link is formatted with the title and he took the titles away
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:25.020]  He admits it was his decision and then it just says the verge.com
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:27.740]  And has no context for the headline
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.540]  and I guess his thinking was
[01:48:32.620 --> 01:48:38.700]  I want people to stay on twitter and not leave to bounce to read articles elsewhere
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:45.260]  So i'm going to penalize the format of URLs to encourage publications to
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:52.780]  Become $10 a month or whatever it costs to post more than that but pay to become a twitter pro user and post
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:59.100]  Your entire article on twitter, which no sane publication was ever going to do like the verge
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:05.020]  You're not going to get neil i patel to have verge writers post the entire article on twitter. That would be
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:12.860]  Stupid but I guess that's what musk wanted. I I feel like he doesn't understand that and that's one thing again tech meme
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:18.300]  Is like daring fireball in a way where we we've always
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.340]  linked tech meme
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:27.600]  Tech meme by design, you know, the whole point of it is you come to tech meme and then you immediately go elsewhere
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:31.900]  To read the actual articles it is come here find out what's happening
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:37.580]  And then yes go go to bloomberg go to new york times go to the verge go to daring fireball and read the article there
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:43.020]  And because you found good stuff through tech meme you'll come back and that's how twitter worked
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:47.420]  And the idea that you would take that away and just try to keep people on twitter
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:53.820]  Is nuts to me it's as nuts as if you change tech meme to try to keep people on tech me
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:56.380]  Right. It doesn't I don't know. It doesn't even make any sense
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:02.300]  Yeah, and you can see how it's going by seeing what actually is promoted by
[01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:09.660]  These new the twitter algorithm changes and the new subscriber formats and all that. It's pretty
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:16.860]  It's pretty crappy stuff. I the I get I still actually get a lot of value out of twitter and it's by
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:23.180]  Meticulously crafting lists and reading those lists in a reverse chronological order
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:28.940]  But anywhere that actual algorithm intrudes it's like get this out of my face
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:37.660]  And i'm not anti algorithm right like threads is is generally algorithmically driven and you can you could switch to a
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:41.980]  Chronological feed if you want, but I actually prefer their algorithm
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.700]  Because their algorithm
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:50.300]  Seems optimized only to surface stuff that's of interest to me and i've sort of feel the same way about
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:53.820]  Instagram too and instagram has the same similar
[01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.180]  It's sort of hidden you have to tap on the logo in the app
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:04.380]  The actual instagram logo and then you can switch to a for you feed that shows the people you follow in chronological order
[01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:07.580]  But in general the algorithm
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:14.380]  the algorithm just seems driven to show you things of interest because that keeps you coming back and that
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:20.780]  That's good for meta if you come back. I found the algorithm very good. I helped it very early by
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.460]  following
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:28.620]  A bunch of accounts and being generous with my likes and things that I found interesting. I found it excellent
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.940]  some people I know
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.620]  have complained about
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:37.580]  like too many influencers and so on but I I think just tending to your follow graph and
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:42.940]  Doing a little liking can get you past that. Yeah. Yeah, and I i've seen a lot of people
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:47.900]  Who their first impression of threads is like, okay, i'll try it
[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:51.020]  Let's see and it's like ah, this is i'm not liking this feed at all
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:57.740]  And that complaint you had about too much influence or content. Why do why am I getting shown all these posts from youtubers?
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:59.020]  I don't want to see that
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.340]  And then a week later I see the same person i've seen this so many times i've lost count of it of hey
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:07.100]  I've stuck with threads for a week and all and my feed is actually a lot better
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:09.420]  Yeah, you know it
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:11.320]  they are
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:16.060]  scarily smart I think at meta in in a very good way where and and
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:20.060]  It is such an interesting contrast with twitter where they're
[01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:21.900]  uh
[01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:25.180]  and I know facebook slogan used to be move fast and break things but it
[01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:31.260]  It it seems as the company has matured they've kept the move fast and dropped the break things
[01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:36.140]  And twitter is so under musk is sort of the opposite. It's move slow and break things
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:42.300]  And I and I just think it shows I think it's and I think for the most part the behavior
[01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:50.000]  Isn't people protesting even though there are a lot of high profile people who are actually protesting the political
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.760]  Climate on twitter and which posts get promoted and the whole thing where the
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.280]  ten dollar a month pro blue check accounts
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:01.260]  get
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:05.280]  algorithmically promoted just because they're paying accounts and
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.040]  the
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.040]  People it's such a bad
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:15.440]  Form of rewards because the people who were most likely to pay still are
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:20.880]  Most likely to willingly pay ten dollars a month for twitter are elon musk fans and they're
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:27.040]  How do I say it gently not the sort of people whose thoughts I really care to hear and yet their algorithm?
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:30.320]  Became optimized to show them first which it
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:35.680]  Makes me a bottom line makes me less interested in going to x
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:40.880]  And let's just say it the name change is stupid
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:48.320]  name change is stupid and I I again i'm a curmudgeon probably a little resistant to change more than most people but
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.720]  x is just a stupid name it is
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:57.440]  I believe so always felt that way and I I think people are pointing to app store trends
[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:02.960]  Demonstrating that with some clarity. Oh, it's it's devastating to their app store ranking
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.440]  I mean it has been it dropped when they changed the name
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:12.480]  And has stayed low and when you go through the list of free downloaded apps the number of apps that are listed above them
[01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.720]  It's almost it's almost comical. What's what's got higher recognition above?
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:22.960]  Uh, I guess that about covers it. I I guess if there's one last bonus question, it's ai
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:26.080]  And I don't know what to say about it
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.720]  Do you see it as a threat to what you do to what techmeme does that ai could?
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.160]  Ai could do a better techmeme than techmeme itself
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:42.160]  I think it's something we gotta stay on top of and find places to
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:46.260]  Apply it where it can be applied successfully
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:49.780]  I do think there are reasons
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.960]  why
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.040]  Why it's not it's
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:55:01.360]  AI-driven alternatives are not gonna be a part of a complete solution right now
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.200]  LLMs are are trained on the past and news has the word new in it and
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.320]  a lot of what makes us interested in
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.120]  news is how it's
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.320]  Certain present things are recombined as something entirely new
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.520]  And the way llms work now
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:25.040]  I I don't think they're they're ready to like rank
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.880]  those new things as well as successfully and
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:36.960]  Another thing like a lot of the value of techmeme is people will go there just to see they'll just look at headlines
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.560]  And no, oh, I know that this thing happened. I'm not even gonna click
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:47.760]  I'm, just gonna glance or like people not many people click on our fundraising headlines
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:54.560]  But you can go to techmeme and three companies in this category were funded today
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:57.840]  Oh, this is something a lot of a lot is being invested in
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.280]  This is something on the way where I can expect some products in the future along these lines
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.920]  and any kind of
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:08.160]  AI-driven news algorithm has to
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:10.960]  It's not possible, but it's got to get that
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.920]  It's got to have that data on what you glanced at and process it and and do something meaningful with it. So
[01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:23.840]  I think there are there are certainly obstacles for ai approaches to
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:26.720]  be awesome in news aggregation, but
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.720]  but boy
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.720]  llms are
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:34.400]  nevertheless despite other flaws are miracles and
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.000]  right, there are a number of ways we need to
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:47.520]  Introduce like either llms for summarizing or like machine learning approaches to better detect
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:50.240]  when certain features
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.960]  When it comes to text and links signal something that may possibly be news
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:57:01.520]  We use a lot of automated approaches already, but we haven't trained neural networks yet to be like
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:05.200]  This is a trending story that you the azure want to consider protect me
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.320]  It's still kind of your algorithm
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.480]  heuristics
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:13.440]  all right, my biggest concern in the near term is
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:14.960]  the
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:21.920]  use of ai and llms and especially the the image generation capabilities to
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.280]  purposefully create false context
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:31.760]  I mean and obviously in the context of a major u.s. Presidential election is sort of what i'm thinking. I
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:35.040]  Think it's a concern, but I sort of feel
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:41.120]  Confident that we'll get past it in the same way that we've gotten past
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:47.200]  Outright attempts to mislead people disinformation not just oh, I honestly
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:51.840]  Believe that bill gates put nanobots in the vaccine
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:58.640]  well, if you honestly believe it, I mean what you're probably not an authoritative source of information on twitter anyway, but people who
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.440]  who purposefully are trying to
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:07.680]  Mislead people. I mean the best one of the best examples of that and it's it's a trick that predates the web
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:11.280]  But trying to convince people of the wrong voting day
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:16.080]  Hey in your state voting day is wednesday not tuesday for this anymore
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:19.040]  And and of course everybody's voting day in the us is tuesday
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.680]  but that's a dirty trick and using ai to commit dirty tricks, I feel like
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.480]  the way that llms can create
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:31.040]  extremely realistic looking photographs of fake things at
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.320]  you know photoshop's been around for 30 years, but
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:41.520]  They ai can do it so fast that it's almost a machine. We as human beings have
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:47.040]  Guards against that and the guard against it is trusting certain sources over time
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:54.000]  Right, and I feel like that's what tech meme is. I hope that's what daring fireball is at an individual voice level
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.800]  but like I because I
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:00.640]  As far as I know you and I think your your employees would agree
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:05.200]  You have no plans to completely automate tech meme and replace the staff with ai
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:11.760]  And that part of what makes tech meme tech meme is that you and your editors know?
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.960]  Who who can be trusted just by name alone?
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.200]  Yeah, and and then that trust
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.600]  goes to the users the users can trust what they see on tech meme and
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.840]  Tech meme knows who they can trust going forward. And so I sort of feel like it's
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:28.640]  It'll be okay
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.640]  Yeah, I think so. I think we would have seen
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:37.120]  a lot more mayhem from deep fakes if these trust networks weren't
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.960]  robust and trusted by by ordinary people
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:47.440]  And yeah, the the ai techniques are getting smarter but uh, for sure the level of mischief will increase
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:49.600]  But I too am optimistic on that
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:53.200]  I almost feel like the bigger danger is
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.800]  using ai and the existence of
[01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:01.600]  Good deep fake technology to say real things are fake
[02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:07.040]  rather than vice versa and i'll just go to the 2016 election and when the
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.480]  Grabber by the pussy tape leaked of the trump which really hurt his poll numbers
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:17.360]  I mean like in the aftermath of that tape coming out that what was it access hollywood was the tv show
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:25.680]  His poll numbers dropped so precipitously after that that there was a serious movement in the republican party to get him to drop out of
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.600]  The race which is just absurd in september of an election year and I know everybody out there's a yeah
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:36.320]  But he won the election anyway, but it's that really really hurt him and I feel like it's just
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.040]  And I feel like if if a similar tape dropped now
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.560]  Him and his cohorts now, I think they would just say fake that was fake fake fake fake
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.200]  Yeah, well, hopefully those those same trust networks can help there
[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:51.360]  but
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.920]  I think trust will be eroded a bit
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:00:56.960]  But we'll hopefully hang in there
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.240]  Well, thank you gabe for your time
[02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:04.000]  This was you've been somebody who I wanted to get on this show for a long time
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.220]  And it was just as much fun talking to you as I expected
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.840]  Let's see. That's what what can we promote?
[02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:13.680]  We've talked about tech meme a lot tech meme if you don't go there my god
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:16.720]  You should go there but your your other two sites in the network are
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:25.120]  Oh, yeah, this is gonna I have to say it carefully meme random, which is meme m e m e o r a n d u m
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.200]  That's the political news aggregator
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.040]  But but that that's a that's a weird that that's only for like hardcore political
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:38.180]  Political hobbyist who also can deal with the chaos that the algorithm
[02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:44.900]  unleashes in in how it presents this news summary the other news vertical we we have editors carefully
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:52.980]  Carefully curating is media gazer. And if you're in content industries or you're into what's happening in journalism or
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:59.460]  Especially digital journalism. I I don't think there's any real substitute for it. It's like a
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:05.220]  It should be it should be what you're checking every day and and i'm gabe rivera on all the social networks
