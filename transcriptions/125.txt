[00:00.000 --> 00:06.400]  Uh, Horace, did you? Welcome. I think this is definitely the first time, right? Unless I'm misremembering.
[00:06.400 --> 00:13.680]  Yeah, definitely, you know, um, now that you had, you know, uh, now that you have fill-on,
[00:13.680 --> 00:18.960]  I guess it's, you know, your legitimate, um, it's worth doing.
[00:18.960 --> 00:23.680]  You know, there was something I was supposed to say last week, I should have, and I forgot,
[00:23.680 --> 00:28.960]  it's a little bit of follow-up from that live episode of the show with, with Phil Schiller.
[00:28.960 --> 00:33.760]  So at the end of the live episode, right towards the end is, I thanked him, I thanked everybody,
[00:33.760 --> 00:39.120]  and then I asked the audience if the live video stream had stayed up, because we, we had tried
[00:39.120 --> 00:44.720]  something new. Uh, we actually had that set up before I knew that, that, uh, Phil Schiller was
[00:44.720 --> 00:48.320]  going to be the guest. We were going to try to live stream it anyway. So I asked the audience,
[00:48.320 --> 00:52.720]  hey, did the live stream stay up? Because my thought was, hey, once word gets out on Twitter,
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.920]  that Phil Schiller is on the show, it might, you know, overwhelm it, and some knucklehead down in front,
[00:57.920 --> 01:04.400]  yelled, no, and, um, and then Phil, Phil made a very funny joke. He said, hey, these things are hard,
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.600]  but I felt bad. I thought, oh, the live stream is down. And then as soon as we got off stage,
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.320]  my, my phone started going off, and, uh, people were texting me and they were like,
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.720]  I'm watching right now live on the video stream. I'm watching right now live on the video stream,
[01:18.720 --> 01:23.680]  did not go down. So I don't know who the knucklehead is in the audience who said that the live stream
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.720]  went down. And maybe there were, uh, problems for a few people here and there, but, uh,
[01:28.720 --> 01:32.800]  there apparently did not go down and there were an awful lot of people who, who did watch it live
[01:32.800 --> 01:36.080]  on the stream. And I wanted, so the reason I want to call that out though is that the company,
[01:36.080 --> 01:41.040]  uh, that did it as a company called hybrid events group. And, uh, I'll put a link to their,
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.200]  their Twitter in the show notes. Um, their, their Twitter is at hybrid events,
[01:47.200 --> 01:53.760]  GRP, because I guess they ran up against the, the limit and Twitter user names. But anyway,
[01:53.760 --> 01:58.000]  they did a great job, couldn't be happier with them. And I feel terrible that at the end of this
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.600]  live stream that they work their asses off to keep up and do a good job on. Uh, it looked like
[02:03.600 --> 02:09.360]  it did not stay up and it went down, but it didn't. So I just, well, you know, speaking, you know,
[02:09.360 --> 02:14.640]  if you have knuckleheads, I mean, the thing is there's always someone, you know, who's not happy.
[02:14.640 --> 02:21.200]  So there's always an, an apple people are just as likely maybe more so to complain, right? So
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.400]  yeah, I guess so. I just don't know what would have driven somebody to shout out know that the
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.560]  stream didn't stay up one. In fact, it did. And, and if there were any problems, they were minor
[02:30.560 --> 02:38.080]  and sporadic. But anyway, it was a lot of fun. So, uh, you, you were out at WWDC.
[02:38.080 --> 02:45.600]  I was, I was there and I was, uh, I was sitting, uh, I was, I was actually fortunate to sit
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.760]  pretty in a pretty good spot. I would actually they, they managed. I came in the late. I had gone
[02:49.760 --> 02:52.800]  to the bathroom because they always tell you go to the bathroom, you know, because they could run
[02:52.800 --> 02:58.560]  long. And, and by the time I came back out, you know, they had led everybody in. So I was like,
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.600]  almost the last person to get in. And I'm like, wondering around near the front trying to find a
[03:03.600 --> 03:09.840]  place because sometimes people, people in the front don't fill up completely. And, uh, and,
[03:09.840 --> 03:18.080]  and I was actually, uh, kindly taken by hand, uh, by an apple person and sat next to actually
[03:18.080 --> 03:26.400]  sat behind, uh, Ben Buhar and, uh, and his father. Um, and, and so I had a, I was like the fifth
[03:26.400 --> 03:32.480]  throw. And it was, it was really, uh, the best seat I ever had. And for now, that, that's what I
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.160]  got for being late. You know, uh, so it was, it was for me, it was a thrill to be, to be in that,
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.640]  in that great spot. And, and, you know, in previous shows, I remember sitting behind you.
[03:44.080 --> 03:51.120]  That was funny, son, which behind between you and, uh, like Renee, for example, you know, uh,
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.760]  and so it's always these great people you meet there. And that's almost more exciting than,
[03:56.400 --> 03:59.200]  than the show itself, you know, just getting to meet these people.
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.000]  Yeah, I have been to enough of these now. It's funny, because it's like, it's dawned on me
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.240]  then now I'm, I'm like, and I've been to enough of these keynotes where I'm sort of a veteran,
[04:08.240 --> 04:13.200]  rather than, uh, uh, a rookie. And I, but I still think of myself. I still think every time I go to
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.880]  one of these things, like, wow, I can't believe that I'm invited to attend one of these apple
[04:16.880 --> 04:20.880]  keynotes. I know it's a, it's a little bit thrilling every time. I've, I've probably been
[04:20.880 --> 04:26.880]  three or four. And it's, it's still, you feel the little bit of a tingle every time, uh,
[04:26.880 --> 04:33.280]  and it's kind of feel privileged to be there. I've had the same experience though, where sometimes
[04:33.280 --> 04:40.720]  if you want a good seat, it's actually advantageous to not wander in with friends or colleagues or,
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.320]  you know, because what happens is you mingle before they open the doors and you see people who,
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.320]  you know, like, remember, I think it was you who took the picture of me and Ben Thompson wearing
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.560]  seemingly identical shirts this year. See me? I thought they were identical.
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.400]  Oh, there was, they were in fact different brands, but it would be very hard for any,
[04:56.400 --> 05:00.000]  but I think you'd have to like look at the label to see the difference. So Ben Thompson and I showed
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.960]  up at, at the keynote dressed like twins and you were kind enough to document that for posterity.
[05:06.960 --> 05:11.200]  But anyway, you run into people who, you know, like that and then you go in the keynote together,
[05:11.200 --> 05:16.000]  but then if it's like a group of five or six of you, you look for five or six seats and it limits
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.440]  where you go. Sometimes going in just by yourself or going to, um, like you used like you go into
[05:21.440 --> 05:28.080]  the restroom. One time, I think it was last year for WWDC at, at the keynote, it used to be for
[05:28.080 --> 05:33.040]  years and years. There's always been a 10 10 o'clock start and it used to be that they let press in
[05:33.920 --> 05:39.360]  very close to the end. I mean, sometimes to the point where people would start like getting nervous
[05:39.360 --> 05:42.560]  and be like, are they forgotten us? Are they going to start without us? Like, there was one year
[05:42.560 --> 05:46.880]  where we, you know, the members of the media didn't get in until, I don't know, five or 10 minutes
[05:46.880 --> 05:54.160]  before 10 o'clock. Um, but it's part of the new Apple with Tim Cook is that stuff runs a lot more
[05:54.160 --> 06:00.080]  regularly and stuff starts exactly on time. I mean, if you've noticed with Tim Cook, the keynote started
[06:00.080 --> 06:06.320]  10, oh, oh, oh, I mean, like to the second, but you know, I noticed a couple other details,
[06:06.320 --> 06:10.160]  maybe you already went over this with your audience, but I, the couple of details, one, they,
[06:10.160 --> 06:17.040]  when they let the press in, they, they segregate the photographers from everybody else.
[06:17.040 --> 06:20.320]  Oh, no, they've always done that. Yeah, they've always done that, but the purpose is that,
[06:20.320 --> 06:25.120]  you know, they've got their own little, they've got their own little bleachers or whatever wing.
[06:25.120 --> 06:29.600]  And then the other thing that's interesting is that then there's kind of like this
[06:29.600 --> 06:34.240]  time when the executives who usually sit in the middle section and the front middle.
[06:34.240 --> 06:40.560]  So the executives begin to come, you know, come in and take their seats. And they're basically
[06:40.560 --> 06:45.200]  they're mingling a little bit with each other. And it's like you see the camera guys just
[06:45.760 --> 06:51.680]  going nuts, taking all these shots of the executives mingling. And I wonder how much of that is
[06:51.680 --> 06:59.600]  planned so that they have this photo op for, for this kind of casual, uh, uh, interaction that
[06:59.600 --> 07:06.160]  happens with, with, uh, with some of the, the superstars of Apple, if you will, you know, you see
[07:06.160 --> 07:11.600]  people would just like, in the audience stand up and, and you, yeah, hey, hey, I see, I see Johnny,
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.480]  you know, or I, I, I see Angela, or I see so and so. And it was funny to see how, you know,
[07:16.480 --> 07:23.520]  it seems, uh, so natural, but I wonder how much of it is actually on purpose done that way to
[07:23.520 --> 07:28.080]  create the opportunity for the photographers to take their shots and have something. I don't know,
[07:28.080 --> 07:32.880]  that's what I think. Uh, it's definitely strategic. I'm not quite sure what the strategy is
[07:32.880 --> 07:37.280]  though. And, and about which sight lines they're looking to give the photographers, it seems to
[07:37.280 --> 07:43.920]  me like what they want is they want the photographers not close, but, and so if you are, if you're
[07:43.920 --> 07:48.080]  serious about taking the photography at the event, you really want to bring long lens and
[07:48.080 --> 07:53.120]  as soon as you're going to, you're going to be zoomed in from a distance, um, and that you're not
[07:53.120 --> 07:58.800]  going to get close. Um, but anyway, last year, I, I think it was last year, I, you know, it was
[07:59.760 --> 08:06.640]  walking to the, um, to the Moscone from my hotel and it was around 930, so it was about half
[08:06.640 --> 08:10.480]  hour before, but I got a text from a couple people that, hey, they've already let us in and I was
[08:10.480 --> 08:15.200]  like, oh crap. So I was like, you were this year. I was like, one of the last ones in and had a
[08:15.200 --> 08:19.120]  similar type thing where I wound up, you know, somebody from Apple PR spotted me looking for a
[08:19.120 --> 08:22.480]  seat and was like, here, come on up here and I sat, I don't know, fit their sixth row or something,
[08:22.480 --> 08:26.320]  but it's weird sitting up there because when you're up there with all the Apple employees,
[08:26.320 --> 08:31.920]  they're the people who sort of applaud at strategic points, uh, and sort of try to get the
[08:31.920 --> 08:37.200]  applause rolling at applause points, which, you know, it's, to me, as a member of the media is,
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.680]  is not really appropriate. It feels a little bit like you're sitting in the home team crowd when you're
[08:41.680 --> 08:46.400]  up there. Really? I know, I didn't sense that, but I did sense another event that they were some
[08:46.400 --> 08:51.520]  cheerleading going on, but I didn't see here at this one, but in the, uh, it, it is, um,
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.320]  it's, it's kind of a interesting experience. I, I guess it's, we're very privileged that we
[08:58.320 --> 09:04.960]  have that access to, to the event, uh, the way we do and, and, uh, to each other and it's wonderful.
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.320]  And in fact, that's where I, I asked you, I said, hey, how about we, we, we get together and do
[09:10.320 --> 09:16.320]  this, right? So yeah, yeah, that was exactly where this cut set up. Um, so now we're
[09:16.320 --> 09:20.640]  a couple of weeks out, and I feel like, and we're, we're about to enter what's more or less
[09:20.640 --> 09:25.120]  this summer, Doldram's news wise. I don't think we're going to get, you know, other than the launch,
[09:25.120 --> 09:31.280]  that this, the imminent launch of Apple music, uh, there's not much going on, you know, never
[09:31.280 --> 09:37.280]  really is in July or August. Uh, so I'm just curious what you think overall with a couple of weeks
[09:37.280 --> 09:41.760]  behind us, what you think in hindsight of, of, you know, the WWDC, you know,
[09:41.760 --> 09:50.880]  well, the, so the, the, you know, it's, I'm not a good analyst of events that way because I tend
[09:50.880 --> 10:02.480]  to look for the, under the under, um, the understated and the, the, is there, is there a deeper
[10:02.480 --> 10:08.160]  thing and I don't dwell on the feature set so much. I'm not making a list of the big ideas. I'm
[10:08.160 --> 10:15.920]  trying to find where the small ideas and, um, the, the, to me, the, the big thing this whole year
[10:16.640 --> 10:26.400]  has been around what I call humanism of Apple. The idea that Apple is presenting a new face,
[10:27.440 --> 10:35.120]  a new definition of its, of its principal operating strategy, which is really about
[10:35.120 --> 10:42.560]  not the algorithm. It's hard to put a word on it because the, the, the, the, the dominant
[10:43.520 --> 10:52.800]  logic of Silicon Valley is that, that power of the algorithm is power of the, of the, of, of business
[10:52.800 --> 11:00.720]  and, and all that flows from it. And, and somehow what I see is this shift where Apple's saying,
[11:00.720 --> 11:04.000]  you know, we don't necessarily believe in the power of the algorithm.
[11:04.000 --> 11:11.280]  In fact, we may actually believe in the anti algorithm and the anti algorithm is the human being
[11:11.280 --> 11:16.960]  and the word I came up with is humanism. Although humanism is a word that was used to
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.800]  counter the notion of a world based, uh, around faith. And so, so this was a sort of a,
[11:24.800 --> 11:30.640]  maybe I got the timing wrong, but maybe a renaissance or a period of time when, when people began
[11:30.640 --> 11:37.360]  looking at the, at humans at, at the center of the universe or the center of thought. And, and that,
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.960]  that idea of putting man in the center was, was a big deal back then because the church was,
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.640]  it was the dominant leader. And, and so my way of thinking is not, I'm not trying to position
[11:48.640 --> 11:55.120]  against faith, but rather position against the notion of the, the all powerful algorithm as,
[11:55.120 --> 12:00.640]  as the, uh, the counterpart to this, to this idea. And so what's the evidence? The evidence is
[12:00.640 --> 12:08.880]  number one of that they believe in curation. They believe in actual people making decisions when,
[12:08.880 --> 12:14.160]  we've seen this already for years and years on the app store that there would be someone making,
[12:14.160 --> 12:17.680]  no, that means they're fallible. That means they're going to make mistakes. That means they're
[12:17.680 --> 12:23.840]  going to make all, uh, you know, upset people and offend people. But with it comes also the benefit
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.840]  of judgment that comes from, from, from the mind of an individual. Second piece of evidence,
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.560]  Johnny I've, you know, his, in all his visions of what people want. Uh, he's making a judgment,
[12:36.560 --> 12:44.480]  he's making a, a call. He's calling the, he's curating essentially what it is that we want. Uh,
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.600]  and rather than, than offering every possible option, they'll tell you, no, these are the best
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.240]  options. We believe that. So these are old stories, the news stories that I think bring it even
[12:54.240 --> 13:02.000]  more to the surface are, well, we're actually going to decide how to surface the music that people
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.120]  should listen to or we're going to surface, um, the, uh, the, uh, generally speaking media. And so
[13:10.080 --> 13:19.040]  trust us with, with our, with our judgment, with our taste. And that idea is so opposite to the
[13:19.040 --> 13:25.360]  algorithmic ideas that exist, uh, as the norm that I feel like somehow this is the beginning.
[13:25.360 --> 13:32.160]  And also by the way, the idea that trust us comes down to privacy, trust us comes down to, uh,
[13:32.160 --> 13:39.120]  to, uh, being able to put together the, the integrated packages that we think are the features
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.720]  that you really need. And no more than that. And so this whole idea has been around sort of
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.200]  latent, but suddenly it's springing up and going head to head with algorithm based, uh, uh,
[13:51.200 --> 13:55.360]  business models. I think that's a great observation. And that's exactly the sort of insight
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.240]  that, uh, honestly, I'm looking for you from, from the keynote. Like, whereas it's not about
[14:00.240 --> 14:06.000]  point point point critiquing the, the performances on stage, but rather trying to suss out
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.440]  what the actual meaning was because I, and I think you'll agree with me here that
[14:09.440 --> 14:15.680]  I, I think one of the more interesting things of today's apple, let's call it Tim Cook's
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.760]  apple, because I think that's roughly, you know, I think it does correspond roughly to, to
[14:19.760 --> 14:25.440]  when he took over as CEO. And I think it's, it's deliberate. And I think it is his personality
[14:25.440 --> 14:33.120]  coming to the surface. I think Apple wants to be better understood by people outside the company.
[14:33.760 --> 14:37.440]  Whereas before, I don't think it was so much that they, they wanted to be misunderstood,
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.840]  but that they just didn't care if you didn't get it. They, they want, they reveled in the,
[14:41.840 --> 14:49.440]  in the mystique of apple. I think the mystique of apple was, uh, there's value in being mysterious,
[14:49.440 --> 14:54.080]  there's value in being misunderstood even because at some point, you're going to get the
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.920]  aha moment that you were wrong. And then those who become aware of it through their own discovery,
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.960]  own that fact, even more deeply. And I think you, right, that is the, the sort of the jobs in
[15:04.960 --> 15:13.280]  ethos of public relations, preserve a distance. And you write, I think there's this sensitivity
[15:13.280 --> 15:19.440]  more towards, well, you know, maybe we don't need to be so mysterious after all. Um, but,
[15:19.440 --> 15:25.440]  but here's where I feel that there's still the mystique, which is that they speak actually
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.520]  plainly of what their intentions are. And when you see this in, in, in Tim Cook's statements,
[15:31.520 --> 15:40.800]  like the product is our north star, that we are concerned about doing good work rather than
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.960]  being profitable or having a rate of return, uh, when he sometimes is very pointedly attacks,
[15:46.960 --> 15:53.280]  some, some Wall Street, uh, punditry. Other times, you know, you see this, this language from,
[15:53.280 --> 16:00.320]  from Johnny I have about does a product deserve to exist. And we, you know, and, and so we,
[16:00.320 --> 16:07.840]  you see these framed, uh, very carefully articulated statements, which, which I would say 99.9%
[16:07.840 --> 16:13.680]  of listeners throw away as, you know, in one year and out the other. And it's just as if,
[16:13.680 --> 16:20.480]  like these guys are just using some kind of, um, some kind of poetry to, to bamboozle us.
[16:20.480 --> 16:26.320]  But what I, I, my, I think perhaps my favorite thing to do in Apple analysis is,
[16:26.320 --> 16:33.440]  let take a literal word out of the horse's mouth analysis of the framing of the phrases,
[16:33.440 --> 16:38.400]  every little detail when they say something and deconstructing it and saying,
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.120]  you know, there's a code in here. There's, there's, there's actually meaningful communication
[16:43.120 --> 16:49.680]  going on. So my take on it is, yes, there is a more art, there's, there's more articulation
[16:49.680 --> 16:56.400]  using, using, um, coding, coded phrases. And this, it's Steve Jobs didn't need to, he would speak
[16:57.280 --> 17:01.760]  from the heart. And so what he, what came out his mouth was, was deconstructed, but, but he
[17:01.760 --> 17:06.720]  was the, was the spokesperson. And now we have simply a lot of other spokespeople who are doing
[17:06.720 --> 17:13.040]  these types of very interesting phraseings. And, and I take them and I, I, I see from that to me,
[17:13.040 --> 17:20.160]  that is what guides my thinking that guides my analysis. Rather than saying, uh, the, the, you know,
[17:20.160 --> 17:27.360]  what the numbers say, uh, and, and what the profit logic might be, I always ask, uh, given their
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.000]  language, how, what are they going to do next? So if we give you the example of like, you know,
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.680]  people were asking a few months ago, what about the car, what about the car? And I said,
[17:35.680 --> 17:40.000]  well, here's how I would work that out. And I would say, what did Johnny, I've saved about,
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.200]  about product, what does Tim Cook say about product? Therefore, the product that has to emerge
[17:45.200 --> 17:50.240]  has to comply to these rules. Uh, they have to have a meaningful contribution. They, it has to be,
[17:50.800 --> 17:57.920]  uh, it has to be, uh, uh, uh, better in ways that are, that in which Apple can contribute,
[17:57.920 --> 18:02.400]  et cetera, et cetera. And so I, what I would do is simply take those verbatim, you know,
[18:02.400 --> 18:08.560]  communication from Apple and, and use those as my lenses to analyze the questions at hand.
[18:08.560 --> 18:14.560]  So in that sense, that's how, that's how Apple is, is different in my way, in my way of thinking,
[18:14.560 --> 18:19.280]  because if you did that with, with Steve Jobs comments, he would flip flop. And on a lot of them
[18:19.280 --> 18:24.560]  were simply like, today I feel this way. Uh, and they couldn't really rely on those statements
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.560]  as guiding, guiding principles. And I think Apple, remember, once it reminds me, what Tim Cook
[18:30.560 --> 18:38.480]  was acting CEO, he went on a conference call and he almost like stated a poem in a poetic way,
[18:39.680 --> 18:45.520]  what we believe in. And he was like, one of these like speeches buried in the, in a conference call
[18:45.520 --> 18:50.640]  with analysts that usually introduce it. And I, I wrote it up and I said, I called it, uh,
[18:50.640 --> 18:56.080]  the Tim Cook doctrine. And this was before he was full-time CEO or I should say permanency.
[18:56.080 --> 19:00.800]  And he, he, you know, I wrote those down and I, I broke the lines up in the way that I almost
[19:00.800 --> 19:06.160]  looked like a poem and I said, you know, there it is. There's the, there's the, there's an algorithm
[19:06.160 --> 19:10.480]  right there about how this business works. We're going to cross pollinate. I remember he used
[19:10.480 --> 19:17.120]  that phrase. Uh, you know, I don't remember a lot of it, but it's, I can go back and dig it up.
[19:17.120 --> 19:21.920]  It's, it's the doctrine in, in, in, it's still in searchable in the blog. So anyway,
[19:21.920 --> 19:27.280]  that's the kind of guy he is, I think. And that's been, that was way back in what 2000, uh,
[19:28.080 --> 19:35.280]  probably eight or nine. So it's, it's, um, it's very much a reflection of what, what you think of
[19:35.280 --> 19:43.600]  as Tim Cook's apple. Yeah. Um, and so you, I, I think part of went wrong in that keynote was the way
[19:43.600 --> 19:47.760]  that, and I don't know if you thought this to, I know most people who I've spoken to agree that
[19:47.760 --> 19:54.160]  the music segment at the end was, was too long and disorganized. But in hindsight, as we get closer
[19:54.160 --> 20:01.760]  to the launch of, of apple music, and I read more and more about it, I see that as the picture
[20:01.760 --> 20:07.760]  becomes more clear to me, it was there. It just wasn't the information was there. What I,
[20:07.760 --> 20:13.040]  what I think we should understand about it was there, but it, it, it was too disorganized for it
[20:13.040 --> 20:18.880]  to be clear. And so part of it is what you said about the humanism and not trusting in the algorithm.
[20:18.880 --> 20:23.440]  And it's, and I know it was there. And I know that, that they mentioned it a few times with the
[20:23.440 --> 20:30.880]  beats one radio, um, how it's going to be, uh, you know, human selected, you know, there's,
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.680]  there was, yeah, curated, perfect word, but there was a New York Times profile today, or yesterday
[20:35.680 --> 20:43.120]  earlier this week of Zane Lowe, who's coming from BBC One in the UK, um, super highly regarded
[20:44.160 --> 20:50.960]  DJ. Um, and I know, this was mentioned in the keynote, but it just kind of, I lost it because I was
[20:50.960 --> 20:57.120]  just losing focus, but it, they mentioned that it, their intention with this is not so much that
[20:57.120 --> 21:02.720]  you're going to pick your favorite genre and go, go to station. It's sort of like the anti-XM
[21:02.720 --> 21:07.280]  radio, like we've got XM radio in our car. And I think there's like two, 200 stations or 300
[21:07.280 --> 21:13.280]  stations. I don't know, unbelievable number, but you can dial into, um, I mean, they have an entire
[21:13.280 --> 21:18.480]  station that's just Frank Sinatra. And there's like a station just for Elvis Presley. Um,
[21:18.480 --> 21:22.240]  with this beats one, their intention, I mean, obviously you're going to be able to stream
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.320]  music based on your preference if that's what you want. But if you listen to beats one, it's
[21:26.320 --> 21:33.120]  any new music that they think is interesting, which is, to me, a really interesting way to go,
[21:33.120 --> 21:38.800]  and it is absolutely not algorithmically generated. Absolutely. That's exactly the thinking that
[21:38.800 --> 21:44.720]  I think this new Apple is about. And I think with Johnny, sorry, uh, Jimmy, uh, I have mine,
[21:44.720 --> 21:50.400]  was the one who probably sold him on, on the idea that you can do this to music. And let me,
[21:50.400 --> 21:55.440]  let me guess here. I'm no, no, no, no evidence, but let me guess that he probably remembered
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.400]  back in the days when there were influential DJs in the United States who pretty much
[22:01.280 --> 22:08.560]  drove musical taste. Uh, who could, uh, you know, who could, uh, uh, influence a generation
[22:09.120 --> 22:14.080]  by selecting the right music and playing it. And you know, over time, that became corrupted
[22:14.080 --> 22:20.080]  by, by scandalous type of, you know, bribing and so on. But, but the job of, of, of,
[22:20.080 --> 22:27.760]  of radio was for the, an, an, an, an, a generation to discover the music that, that, that spoke
[22:27.760 --> 22:35.840]  for them. And what, what, what we're seeing now with, with an abundance and an overabundance of choice
[22:35.840 --> 22:41.360]  is that there isn't, you, you assume, here's the assumption I think of the, of the, of the,
[22:41.360 --> 22:47.440]  of the internet is that, um, you can select it for yourself. And I think that's not the case
[22:47.440 --> 22:53.040]  for most people. Secondly, you can use your friends as a, as a selection criteria, which is
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.760]  somewhat what Twitter does is you use a, your, your feed as a way to select what to read. Uh,
[22:59.760 --> 23:03.440]  and so there's that notion that you select good friends and your friends are going to select
[23:03.440 --> 23:09.200]  good things for you. Uh, but that has its pitfalls as well. What if you select the wrong friends?
[23:09.200 --> 23:14.480]  And, and, and, and finally, there's the algorithm, which is the idea that, let's, let's sample
[23:14.480 --> 23:19.840]  what you like, and then we'll, we'll give you, uh, we'll give you, uh, selections. And all of
[23:19.840 --> 23:27.520]  these were, are, are the, the, the modern version of discovery. What Apple is saying is, let's go
[23:27.520 --> 23:35.840]  back to this idea that, no, it's an individual that we trust, an individual who, who has
[23:36.720 --> 23:42.560]  supreme ability at taste, supreme ability at judgment about things. And, and that's again,
[23:42.560 --> 23:48.480]  this is, this is a reflection of, of the, uh, logic of, of, uh, Johnny I, and then even the logic
[23:48.480 --> 23:53.680]  of Steve, Steve Jobs, which said, you know, at the end of the day, we're going to decide
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.960]  what products are the ones we're going to dedicate so much energy to, and we're not going to do
[23:58.960 --> 24:02.800]  a portfolio strategy. We're not going to hedge our bets and we're not going to do all these things.
[24:02.800 --> 24:10.080]  We're going to hit a home run every time. Um, and by the way, you know, if I were to say, well,
[24:10.080 --> 24:13.920]  that's, that's crazy. It's only those two guys who can do it. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[24:13.920 --> 24:17.440]  it's, it's not something that anybody else can do. But look at how you would look at the way
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.600]  companies like Pixar are able to hit home runs every time because they have a brain trust,
[24:23.600 --> 24:27.600]  because they selected people who know how to make great stories and gave them to,
[24:27.600 --> 24:35.280]  authority to say, yes, spent $3,400 million on this project and three, four years to get it done.
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.200]  And yet they, they do it every time and it, you know, we, we, we, we, we love them for it.
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.080]  Uh, in contrast to a company that, you know, old Disney who just, you know, put out a portfolio
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.680]  and say essentially they're playing with a spreadsheet in order to decide what to make. And that's,
[24:53.680 --> 24:59.280]  that's a difference. Instinct versus spreadsheets or the human versus the algorithm.
[24:59.280 --> 25:04.320]  And this is what surfaced, I think, through this, through this event is how much more
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.040]  music is going to turn into that for as far as Apple is concerned. And that is a very,
[25:09.040 --> 25:12.320]  very different thing than what we've heard in the past from everyone else.
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.920]  Yeah. Pixar is a good example too, because I think that they've been so open about so much of
[25:17.920 --> 25:23.760]  their process. It's not really a mystery, according to them, you know, how they've been so successful.
[25:23.760 --> 25:28.960]  And yet nobody else can bring themselves to do it and to do it. Yeah. It's like hiding in
[25:28.960 --> 25:34.880]  plain side or here's the, here's the formula, but no one can, no one has the courage to do that
[25:34.880 --> 25:41.680]  because it requires saying no to things which are nearly, uh, proven to work. Uh, you have to say
[25:41.680 --> 25:48.480]  that portfolio theory is the foundation of finance and, and, and who would, and they're wildest
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.600]  my, it's like, if I were an investor and I would say, oh, no, forget about buying a basket of
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.800]  securities just buy one company and own it all your life. Yeah. That would be the strategy that
[25:58.800 --> 26:04.080]  Apple is suggesting they do as far as their investments or that Pixar does in terms of their
[26:04.080 --> 26:10.080]  investments. Yeah. Do you have to have so much faith in that decision that, you know, you're
[26:10.080 --> 26:17.200]  throwing away the hedge opportunity, right? You're throwing away the, the, what if it doesn't go
[26:17.200 --> 26:24.800]  right? And, and so, so remember when Steve Jobs said, uh, focuses about saying no and focuses
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.480]  is, is, is literally about saying no to everything else, but the one thing. And so that's what's so
[26:30.480 --> 26:36.080]  hard. And, um, and here, you know, when we think about it, that, so this is very deep in the,
[26:36.080 --> 26:40.080]  in the psyche of Apple in many ways, but when we're looking at it now through the, through this
[26:40.080 --> 26:45.760]  question of products that they're launching as services, they're essentially telling, I think that,
[26:45.760 --> 26:52.640]  you know, we're asking you to trust us to act, to make those choices for you when it comes to
[26:52.640 --> 26:58.800]  services and things we're going to give you. Uh, and, and, and that means to say no to a lot of
[26:58.800 --> 27:05.120]  things. And many people will just, you know, huff and puff and say, how dare you, but, but those who,
[27:05.120 --> 27:10.400]  who, you know, go ahead, you don't have to buy this isn't like, you know, uh, you're,
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.920]  you're not obligated, but it's, it's, it's the way that I think that you're going to appeal to
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.280]  the, the type of audiences that are probably the, the best audiences to have.
[27:21.280 --> 27:26.480]  Yeah. All right. Let me take a break. I want to keep talking about music afterward, but, um,
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.680]  let me take a break and thank, uh, the first of our three sponsors for the episode and it's
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.880]  our good friends. I'm so happy to have them back. I love this company. Uh, it's our good friends at
[27:36.880 --> 27:46.560]  Backplace. You guys remember Backplace, uh, online unlimited backup for your Mac. Uh, what do you do?
[27:46.560 --> 27:53.440]  You go to backblaze.com. You download their software. You install it on your Mac and you get 30 days
[27:53.440 --> 27:59.200]  free trial. It backs up everything on your Mac. Everything just backs the whole thing up to the cloud.
[27:59.200 --> 28:06.960]  Their cloud based server, um, and after the 30 days, you pay five bucks a month. That's it.
[28:08.160 --> 28:11.920]  And it just backs up your whole everything. You have an external hard drive in addition to your
[28:11.920 --> 28:20.080]  internal hard drive. It backs that up to everything. Uh, they have over 150 petabytes of data
[28:20.080 --> 28:27.040]  backed up so far. Uh, and they have restored over 10 billion files for their customers.
[28:27.040 --> 28:33.680]  You can access all of your data from your Mac or from multiple max. If you have two max,
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.840]  sign up for two accounts, five bucks per machine per month. That's it. Everything's online,
[28:37.840 --> 28:44.720]  but you can access it anywhere. Uh, you can use their iPhone app. I, I pad up and get just one file
[28:44.720 --> 28:48.480]  when you're out and about. If you need to, you know, send a file to somebody and you just log
[28:48.480 --> 28:54.480]  into backblaze from their app on your phone. Uh, go through all of your files that are backed up,
[28:54.480 --> 28:58.880]  find the file you want and do whatever you want with it. So you can download one file at a time.
[28:58.880 --> 29:04.080]  If you have a catastrophe, if you needed, if a disaster actually strikes, uh, you just go to your
[29:04.080 --> 29:09.680]  account, you can just pay and they'll just put everything from your account, load it up on a USB drive
[29:09.680 --> 29:15.200]  and, uh, have it overnighted to you. Uh, so you can restore one, one file at a time from anywhere you
[29:15.200 --> 29:22.160]  want, get all of your files, uh, put on a USB hard drive, whatever you need. 25% of all of their
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.560]  restores, though, are just one file at a time. It's once you have the ability to get any of your
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.800]  files anywhere, you realize it's more than just, uh, like backup or recovery from catastrophe. It's,
[29:32.800 --> 29:38.480]  it's really about convenience. Really great software. I recommend it so wholeheartedly. I've got it on
[29:39.120 --> 29:45.760]  every Mac in the house here at the during fireball headquarters. Uh, and like I said, it's a risk-free
[29:45.760 --> 29:51.120]  no credit card required trial. So you have nothing to lose just by trying it if you haven't yet.
[29:51.120 --> 29:55.680]  Don't put it off. It putting off getting it back up system in place, worst thing you can do
[29:55.680 --> 30:03.040]  because that's when Murphy's Law will hit. So just go here, go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball
[30:03.040 --> 30:07.520]  and you'll they'll, they'll know you came from here, uh, and sign up today. If you haven't signed
[30:07.520 --> 30:16.320]  up so far, you're nuts. It's, it's a great service backblaze.com daring fireball. Um, so music,
[30:16.320 --> 30:27.040]  uh, part of the news of the last week was this crazy to me. It, it, the Taylor Swift story, right?
[30:27.040 --> 30:34.480]  So recording here on Friday, June 26th and it was last Sunday where Taylor Swift wrote, uh,
[30:35.520 --> 30:42.080]  a blog post post on her Tumblr account, more or less calling taking Apple to task for the fact
[30:42.080 --> 30:49.280]  that in the, in the free trial for Apple music, uh, the three month free trial, Apple wasn't
[30:49.280 --> 30:56.000]  going to pay artists for the music that got streamed. They were only going to pay, uh, a percentage
[30:56.000 --> 31:01.200]  based on, you know, the paid accounts once the free trial period is over. And Taylor Swift's argument
[31:01.200 --> 31:06.240]  was, uh, this isn't right. You know, the free trial is a promotion for your service. We should get,
[31:06.240 --> 31:12.800]  you know, we, the artists should get paid no matter what. And, and it not only worked, it worked by
[31:12.800 --> 31:18.880]  the end of the day, by the end of the day at EQ, uh, you know, this Apple senior vice president in
[31:18.880 --> 31:25.040]  charge of, of music, among other things, was tweeting that, uh, okay, I've called Taylor Swift,
[31:25.040 --> 31:29.760]  we've worked it out and, and we'll be paying artists even during the free trial period.
[31:29.760 --> 31:35.200]  I'm, I'm kind of blown away by that just by the speed it, which it happened and how it kind of,
[31:35.840 --> 31:41.680]  in terms of being a longtime Apple observer that it, it, like the public aspect of it that it took
[31:41.680 --> 31:49.520]  place, uh, you know, from one Apple executives Twitter account. I was, yeah, I was watching it and
[31:49.520 --> 31:58.080]  I was, I was, I was bemused. I personally, I didn't have an opinion on it on one way. I think this
[31:58.080 --> 32:04.160]  is just business, uh, you know, terms, terms and conditions that are in contracts are often
[32:04.160 --> 32:11.200]  negotiable and sometimes you use boilerplate that might not, you know, be appropriate for everybody
[32:11.200 --> 32:17.440]  and, you know, uh, then you change it and, and that's, that's what we call negotiation and,
[32:17.440 --> 32:22.960]  and it wasn't to me. This is just a matter of business. But the, uh, I think the noteworthy thing
[32:22.960 --> 32:28.560]  was your, your, you know, your observation that they were so responsive to it in such a public way.
[32:28.560 --> 32:37.280]  And in fact, it's a negotiation took place in public on, on, on Twitter. That, that amuses me greatly.
[32:37.280 --> 32:43.440]  I'm not outraged. You know, in fact, I refuse to be outraged anymore, um, about anything. So I'm,
[32:43.440 --> 32:51.440]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little bit just, uh, just reflecting on, on the age we live in that this is
[32:51.440 --> 32:57.440]  happening. And, uh, in the end, it turns out very well for everybody. I, I don't think this was a big
[32:57.440 --> 33:02.480]  deal for Apple to even do it initially, but they just probably wasn't something that they thought
[33:02.480 --> 33:07.440]  of. They said, well, it's just standard practice, you know, that, well, yes, it's our service,
[33:07.440 --> 33:11.840]  but it's, it's, it's, in the end, they're gonna grow your business as well. So, you know, where we
[33:11.840 --> 33:17.120]  think of it as a partnership. So we both take a hit, but at the end, uh, he said, they said,
[33:17.120 --> 33:22.960]  all right, well, we'll absorb that cost, uh, upfront and pass it on, because you're right,
[33:22.960 --> 33:28.560]  you know, probably very well off its money we don't need as much as you do. But, you know, it's,
[33:29.920 --> 33:32.880]  it's just the way it happened. I guess that's what's interesting.
[33:32.880 --> 33:38.000]  Same to me. And I, I feel like it's also further signed the, and I think Apple accepts this.
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.400]  I don't think there's any other way, but with the success that they've had and the size that
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.680]  they've grown to, a lot of the times when something like this happens, there's no way that they can
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.680]  truly win. Because I saw people saying the next day, like on Monday, that this is sort of
[33:53.680 --> 33:59.600]  makes Apple look weak. It makes them, you know, that they capitulated, that they, that they gave in,
[33:59.600 --> 34:06.000]  you know, and it doesn't make Apple look good, that, that they scrambled to do this. Whereas,
[34:06.000 --> 34:14.000]  my guess is, is that inside Apple that they're take on this is, why not make it look like we're
[34:14.000 --> 34:19.520]  paying attention? Because we are paying attention, right? I mean, it's, you know, we saw the tailors.
[34:19.520 --> 34:24.800]  Why put it off? Why, why, why make it look, why wait a week or two and make it look like
[34:25.440 --> 34:29.760]  we're a black box who doesn't respond to stuff like this? Or like we called our lawyers and we
[34:29.760 --> 34:35.840]  called our, you know, consultants or something like that. It's, it's clear. I think it's as simple as
[34:35.840 --> 34:40.480]  what Eddie Q said that he and Tim Cook talked on the phone Sunday and said, all right, we'll just,
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.640]  you know, we'll pam during the trial period. Yeah, exactly. And so, and by the way, I think the
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.040]  reason Apple is in the business of music anyways, because they love music, as they say many times
[34:51.040 --> 34:55.600]  over and over again, again, one of these statements that people just, you know, just goes right
[34:55.600 --> 35:01.280]  over over consciousness because they say it all the time, you know, we love music. And by saying
[35:01.280 --> 35:07.120]  we love music, they're not just saying, yeah, we love being, you know, remember the dancing of,
[35:07.840 --> 35:13.360]  of Eddie Q on stage. The point is that they do love music because actually they think that that's a
[35:13.360 --> 35:20.800]  core, that's a cornerstone of the business. That is, they want to be seen as a brand associated
[35:20.800 --> 35:26.720]  with music musicians and artists and creative people. Going back to think different, who did they
[35:26.720 --> 35:30.960]  put up on the think different campaign? They're all people who are creative people, fundamentally,
[35:30.960 --> 35:38.960]  whether they were scientific, artistic, cultural, social creative people. And so the idea is that
[35:38.960 --> 35:44.240]  that's what the brand rests on. And so I don't know anybody who would think that Apple
[35:44.240 --> 35:51.040]  benefits by being a tough guy with artists. They come to the story. They're coming to the
[35:51.040 --> 35:58.320]  to the table with music. In fact, spending all that money on a music, the acquisition of beats
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.080]  was spending a ton of billions of dollars on a company founded by musicians or music executive,
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.360]  you know, a partner with them with the musician. And the whole company is like saying,
[36:11.360 --> 36:19.360]  try to tell the world, we want creativity to flourish. And we want our tools to be used by
[36:19.360 --> 36:25.520]  creative people. So we own their side, we own your side to, you know, addressing their customer
[36:25.520 --> 36:32.320]  in a way. And so that is why, if they quote, cave into them, they're just saying, look, we're
[36:32.320 --> 36:39.120]  just being overly, you know, the fault is, is that we're being actually overly generous when maybe a
[36:39.120 --> 36:46.800]  cynical view would be that we ought to be much more, you know, tight, tight with money. And
[36:46.800 --> 36:53.920]  that's not a good thing. This come across as being being, being restrictive with your, with your
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.840]  terms. You can be restrictive when you're dealing with another company. And I'm sure they drive a
[36:57.840 --> 37:02.960]  hard bargain. But when it comes to artists, the way you want to project is that you're being very
[37:02.960 --> 37:08.800]  generous. And that, that therefore reflects on, also on developers, ultimately, who are part of the
[37:08.800 --> 37:14.880]  ecosystem. And so I think it's, it turns out well, the only people who are going to be, who are
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.320]  going to be critical of that decision. I think our, our, our cynics, because I don't, I don't think
[37:20.320 --> 37:32.400]  Apple's brand is about being, being a, being a confrontational with those who, who use its tools.
[37:33.040 --> 37:39.120]  Yeah, I agree with that. And I think I saw some of that cynicism in, in the aftermath of this,
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.040]  you know, okay, we'll, you know, we'll pay you during the free trial thing. If it's, if that's such a
[37:43.040 --> 37:48.160]  sticking point. And I think the truth of it is that it's so little money to Apple. I mean,
[37:48.160 --> 37:53.280]  they're, you know, the terms have leaked. And apparently this is fairly standard across the
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.640]  industry, you know, Spotify is paying somewhere around the same amount where it's about
[37:59.520 --> 38:09.520]  two tenths of one cent per play for, for streaming. So in other words, five streams to get one penny
[38:09.520 --> 38:15.200]  in payment, which is so little money, no matter how popular this thing gets. I mean, just a little
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.880]  back of the envelope math. But if, you know, it, you know, like a hundred billion plays is,
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.960]  at times, wait, let me think, I got to make sure I get this right, 100, this is right, 100
[38:29.520 --> 38:39.280]  billion. All right, times 0.002 is only $200 million, which is a long, you know,
[38:39.280 --> 38:46.800]  it's just, it's just, I don't even know. They paid the three billion for beats. And, you know,
[38:46.800 --> 38:53.600]  it's, it would be a long time before they paid three billion in, in fees. Just for, and this is
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.720]  just talking about the free trial period, right? Once people pay for the $10 a month thing,
[38:58.720 --> 39:03.280]  the payments will all come out of, you know, there's no charity involved. There's no, you know,
[39:03.280 --> 39:08.160]  the Apple's not eating the cost of anything. Everything will come out of a percentage of what
[39:08.160 --> 39:14.880]  people are actually paying. So it, it doesn't matter how popular Apple music is, how many people sign
[39:14.880 --> 39:22.240]  up for this free trial and how many songs they play on it. It just can't add up to an overall
[39:22.240 --> 39:27.840]  meaningful number for Apple in terms of what they would be paying. So I think the idea that,
[39:27.840 --> 39:33.040]  and the idea that they were trying to squeeze that minuscule amount of millions of dollars,
[39:33.040 --> 39:37.440]  because ultimately it's going to be in the millions, not billions, no matter where it falls.
[39:37.440 --> 39:41.200]  The idea that they were trying to screw artists out of that and take advantage of them in the
[39:41.200 --> 39:46.080]  free period, I think is, is, it's too cynical. I mean, it's certainly possible, but it just
[39:46.080 --> 39:53.040]  doesn't sound right to me. I think that it's exactly what they said, which is that they're hoping
[39:53.040 --> 39:58.560]  that they're going to get so many people onto paid accounts and therefore have like a real
[39:59.200 --> 40:07.120]  sustainable model for artists to get paid for digital streaming that, you know, they just saw that free
[40:07.120 --> 40:12.640]  trial as a way for everybody to sort of benefit from the long term of having people signed up for
[40:12.640 --> 40:18.240]  actual paid accounts. Sure, and that's the way it works. I mean, when you're, when the point of free
[40:18.240 --> 40:26.320]  trials is that everybody who's, you're doing it because you want to gain people's business and you
[40:26.320 --> 40:32.560]  want to gain people's attentions and it makes a lot of sense to, to, in this case, because also
[40:32.560 --> 40:40.000]  there isn't a cost in giving it away. Remember, this is digital media. So if they listen to those
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.760]  streams, maybe those streams where I've never gotten listened to, it's not that they're going to stop
[40:43.760 --> 40:49.120]  listening and somewhere where they are paying and then start listening on this service, or maybe
[40:49.120 --> 40:54.640]  they will, but you know, they'll shut off Spotify and some, some artists might see a decrease in
[40:54.640 --> 41:00.160]  revenue for this trial period. But generally again, these are, these are very small amounts and I,
[41:00.160 --> 41:06.400]  I, I think this is, this is one of those things that I felt that I wasn't, I wasn't motivated by it
[41:06.400 --> 41:13.040]  enough to even make a comment about it. So I, I thought it is to me that the news is in, in the way
[41:13.040 --> 41:19.280]  it happened. Not, not, not what, what the outcome was. Yeah, I think so too. Um, I'm definitely curious
[41:19.280 --> 41:25.280]  to see how popular album music becomes, but it's, yeah, it's sort of outside my purview. I'm just
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.720]  not into popular music. So I don't know. No, no, I'm not. That's been a, that's something I'm embarrassed
[41:30.720 --> 41:36.480]  about, but they, but then again, you get to a certain age. One thing I, I have as a, as a, as a, as a
[41:36.480 --> 41:44.400]  theory, uh, about, uh, the human condition. It's that when music discoveries is a young, young man or
[41:44.400 --> 41:50.880]  young woman's, uh, problem, uh, when you get to a certain age, you know what you like and you've
[41:50.880 --> 41:59.600]  already probably got it. And so very few, uh, people get interested in new music at a certain age.
[41:59.600 --> 42:06.240]  And, uh, and so that's why the genres break into nostalgia and, you know, you can get a radio
[42:06.240 --> 42:11.200]  station for every decade, uh, because people want to go back to that time when they were young
[42:11.200 --> 42:17.040]  and that was the formative years where, where that music speaks to them. And, um, by the way,
[42:17.040 --> 42:23.440]  the interesting thing is that there wasn't such a thing in the 1960s because the industry
[42:23.440 --> 42:30.080]  was so new and there wasn't, um, the, the idea of popular music was just recently created. So
[42:30.080 --> 42:38.080]  the nostalgia would have been for jazz or for, uh, for that sort of music that the 1920s, uh,
[42:38.080 --> 42:44.640]  forget the names of some of those, uh, types of music then, but, um, and it wasn't recorded.
[42:44.640 --> 42:50.720]  And so people weren't going to go back to, to, to try to relive that time with, through music.
[42:50.720 --> 42:55.680]  So it's a very much a phenomenon of the 20th century. I love one thing about the music of
[42:55.680 --> 43:02.080]  fans or the music part of the event that that I think didn't maybe rise high enough in
[43:02.080 --> 43:07.360]  consciousness was that video they showed where they, they narrated through imagery, the,
[43:07.360 --> 43:12.080]  how music changed over the years. And I think they missed a little bit with that video because
[43:12.080 --> 43:16.800]  it wasn't narrated. They just had images only. But then that, the way you, you could read that
[43:16.800 --> 43:23.760]  narration is like, if you go back in history, ever since music became a recorded product,
[43:23.760 --> 43:30.160]  it's changed not just in the form of the medium or the, the media that was used to capture it
[43:30.160 --> 43:38.080]  from, from vinyl to, to tape to CD, but also because of those, at that time, the music that
[43:38.080 --> 43:44.080]  we in my language would be, it was hired for different things. The, you know, the, the first record
[43:44.080 --> 43:50.400]  players were, were hired to play music in the, in the living room to the whole family and you
[43:50.400 --> 43:56.880]  probably have a very few records and maybe it would actually dance to them in the formal way.
[43:56.880 --> 44:03.920]  And, and so over time you see how music became a different thing. And, and with, when it became
[44:03.920 --> 44:10.000]  concentrated enough and, and portable enough so that you could carry 500 song or 1000 songs in
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.600]  your pocket, then it became yet another thing. And, and then when it became something you, you,
[44:15.600 --> 44:21.040]  you could get on the internet through a stream. It became yet another thing. So what,
[44:21.040 --> 44:26.880]  you know, buddy would have thought in the 1960s, I would have these wearable headphones and I would
[44:26.880 --> 44:33.360]  go running with, with them to, to, and use music as a way to, to, to motivate myself for my
[44:33.360 --> 44:41.280]  workout or I would use these at work to, to, to isolate myself from, from, from the noise in the
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.680]  background or, or I would, I would wear these on a commute. That use case, those types of uses
[44:47.680 --> 44:54.080]  for music emerged only because of the technology that was available at that time. And, so in some
[44:54.080 --> 44:59.040]  ways what they're saying is that we as Apple, we made one of those eras happen and now we're
[44:59.040 --> 45:04.240]  going to move to another era and we're going to make this happen for the, for not just the consumer
[45:04.240 --> 45:10.080]  but also for the musicians. And so this whole story I think is wonderful because it's about the
[45:10.080 --> 45:15.040]  evolution of music, the evolution of how music was consumed and what purpose it had and meaning
[45:15.040 --> 45:20.720]  but it had in people's lives. And to the chagrin of many, many people in the industry, it seems as
[45:20.720 --> 45:26.160]  if music has been, has been devalued over time. It has, once we've had so much of it and it's so
[45:26.160 --> 45:31.440]  easy to obtain and, and if we can carry so much of it in our pockets that it's, you know, we've
[45:31.440 --> 45:38.160]  traded analog dollars for digital pennies and, or, or digital dimes and then, and then streaming pennies.
[45:39.120 --> 45:46.880]  But, so that's, that's the sort of the, the, the, the, the negative spin on it. But the positive
[45:46.880 --> 45:52.080]  spin is actually we consume more music than ever. We're surrounded by it. We have access to it. We,
[45:52.080 --> 45:56.720]  we can sample. We can try new things. And so when, when, if you were to take the positive spin on
[45:56.720 --> 46:04.320]  it and Apple would say, the conversation to the artist is that, hey, let us help you surface this,
[46:04.320 --> 46:10.880]  let us help you actually take advantage of technology that helps, helps you continue in your
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.680]  craft and for the consumer the same, the same thing is like, let's find music that, that you
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.960]  wouldn't have ever found before. That is, that is so inspiring or delightful and that really
[46:20.960 --> 46:26.320]  doesn't improve your life. So, so, so that's, that's why Apple's in the music business. They come
[46:26.320 --> 46:31.600]  in and say, we're not here to figure out a new monetization strategy. We're here to actually
[46:31.600 --> 46:36.640]  make sure that music survives. The music is, is continuing to be an important part of life.
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.240]  I, again, I sound like like a, a pitchman for, for the, for beats. But the idea is, is, is,
[46:42.240 --> 46:45.680]  is that I've thought about this for years and years. And when I was thinking about
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.640]  where's music going to end up being? What, what, what, what is, what is the job to be done music is
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.920]  hard to do? And looking through history, realize that that job changes and that you've got to change
[46:55.920 --> 47:02.800]  along with that. Yeah. Yeah. I think that the idea that Apple should have, I've seen some people
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.960]  speculate, you know, that, that, hey, why does Apple, why does Apple even bothering with this at all?
[47:06.960 --> 47:12.720]  They don't need to do music. They don't need to be this involved, right? They, they've, you know,
[47:12.720 --> 47:19.120]  you can, you can, why not just let Spotify and Pandora handle it all? They've got great iOS apps,
[47:19.120 --> 47:23.120]  you can play them from any of your Apple devices. Why does Apple even need to do this? And I think
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.200]  it's because, I think it's what you said. I think it's because they want to, because they really
[47:27.200 --> 47:33.680]  think music is part of what they want their company to be. Yeah. It might be of a conversation once
[47:33.680 --> 47:41.840]  I had with someone at Pixar. And I said, why don't you guys go into doing TV? Because you've got these
[47:41.840 --> 47:47.920]  great storytelling techniques and tools and things like that. Why don't you, they make shorts and
[47:47.920 --> 47:55.200]  movies, nothing in between. And they're like, the answer was because we love movies. And I had no
[47:55.200 --> 48:03.040]  way to, I was taken aback. I was like, oh, yeah, of course, you know, it's, it's, here I am thinking
[48:03.040 --> 48:09.840]  like a technician or I'm trying to segment the world by what is possible. And, and at the end
[48:09.840 --> 48:14.880]  of decision is like, no, we just love stuff. And that's why we do things. And if we don't, if we
[48:14.880 --> 48:18.560]  did things that we didn't love, then we wouldn't, we wouldn't be good at all. And so the formula of
[48:18.560 --> 48:22.720]  Pixar isn't just like we know how to turn the crank. It's like we really are passionate and the
[48:22.720 --> 48:28.000]  passionate is key. And so in this case, it's, I think, it's the same thing. I mean, why is Apple
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.960]  in, in anything? Why shouldn't they just leave, leave payments to someone else? Why should they
[48:32.960 --> 48:38.880]  be, be trying to make better photographs? Why should they be trying to make better, you know, even
[48:38.880 --> 48:43.920]  movies with iMovie and even though nobody's using it? Or why isn't, you know, why are they doing,
[48:43.920 --> 48:49.680]  I work at all? Is that stupid? You know, why, why get into that and kill it? Kill it every time I hear
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.720]  is like, shut it down, shut down Apple TV. It's a failure. Shut down this and that. And I,
[48:54.720 --> 48:59.920]  I always think that look, they didn't get into it just for that purpose to sort of make money
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.760]  or to become a success by your, your definition of it. They probably did it because they think
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.880]  it's part of their fiber and it's, it's something that they feel that that will complete them
[49:10.880 --> 49:15.840]  or, or, you know, just, and I don't want to make it seem like, you know, there's some kind of
[49:15.840 --> 49:20.400]  an artistic entity. But, but when they, when they ask artists, this question is like, why did you
[49:20.400 --> 49:24.800]  paint this thing and not show it to anybody? He said, well, I had to get it out. I had to get it out and
[49:24.800 --> 49:30.480]  I don't care if anybody sees it. In some ways, you ought to think about business this way because
[49:30.480 --> 49:38.080]  this is, this is the, the, this is the sort of antithesis of an analytic approach is actually
[49:38.080 --> 49:46.080]  one of being entirely empathy based. And so, but, but that empathy allows you to create greatness.
[49:46.080 --> 49:52.560]  And it may lead you to that one great business as well, but it is, doesn't happen through a
[49:52.560 --> 49:58.560]  deliberate act. It happens through a discovery act. And so this is the, this is why when they make
[49:58.560 --> 50:05.040]  choices that are based on these, these, these instincts. And, and then people say, well, it's,
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.200]  it's not economical or it doesn't make sense or the, the, the, they're stepping on toes and things
[50:09.200 --> 50:13.680]  like that. But one, on one hand, on Apple, that's, that's the narrative. On the other hand, on
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.880]  Google, nobody complains that they get into all kinds of crazy moonshots. And they all applaud,
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.960]  you know, and if, if, if Apple's, however, even slightly veers off of what is thought to be the
[50:24.960 --> 50:30.800]  well trot and path, then, then people is the, you know, jump up with criticism and, and oh,
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.800]  this is the end of Apple. This is the, obviously this is not their forte. There should not be in
[50:34.800 --> 50:42.240]  this, et cetera, et cetera. Hey, it's, it's, it's, some people do R&D, some people do moonshots
[50:42.240 --> 50:49.040]  in Apple just wants to do, wants to, in, in, you know, indulge some ideas about what they think
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.600]  is important or education, for example, why are they in the education, why are you getting into
[50:53.600 --> 50:59.200]  health care? Why are they getting into fitness tracking? Are these all money making opportunities?
[50:59.200 --> 51:05.120]  Someday, but, you know, I, I don't see a way I could put that on the spreadsheet. And I don't care
[51:05.120 --> 51:10.080]  either. It's about really doing things, which they think, stitch together into a fiber that holds
[51:10.080 --> 51:15.280]  up the whole thing. And that's, that's the business of Apple. I think that's not, and maybe that is
[51:15.280 --> 51:19.040]  a new business of Apple, because if, in, in Steve Jobs time, there would have been more,
[51:19.040 --> 51:24.240]  there would have been a little bit less diverse diversification. But it, it's still,
[51:25.360 --> 51:29.840]  it to me, this is, this is because the, the fiber is so much broad and, and, and, and, and
[51:29.840 --> 51:35.440]  there needs to be so much more to support billions of, or potential billions of users.
[51:35.440 --> 51:40.480]  I think fundamental to the culture of Apple, the corporate culture, and I definitely
[51:40.480 --> 51:48.720]  started with Steve Jobs without question, and it was deliberate and continues to have unforeseen
[51:48.720 --> 51:53.920]  consequences and allows Apple to do things you may not, you know, 10 years from now that we
[51:53.920 --> 52:02.560]  wouldn't have predicted today, is the fact that they don't do a P&L for each product or division,
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.440]  or however you want to talk about it, that they're not set up as a, as a, they don't have
[52:07.440 --> 52:12.640]  divisions within the company. They're, they're completely functionally organized. In fact, they're
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.560]  more functionally organized than, than even before with Steve Jobs, where, where Johnny Ives
[52:19.440 --> 52:25.360]  team took over design of everything, not just hardware design, but that, with the four-stall
[52:25.360 --> 52:30.160]  Alster and taking over all of software design that they weren't separate, you know, there wasn't
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.920]  one team doing iOS design. They created a new function and with design that's really deep and
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.080]  exactly right. And that this is something I've been, I'm glad you brought it up because I think it's
[52:40.080 --> 52:50.000]  one of the most under understood aspects of the Apple algorithm, which is that they essentially
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.800]  said no to, to a divisional organization, which, which, see, here's the narrative I have on it,
[52:56.800 --> 53:02.400]  which is that, that's fine for small companies. In fact, if you're a startup, you are, by the fault,
[53:02.400 --> 53:06.720]  a functional organization, it makes sense that you're going to have a somebody, you're usually
[53:06.720 --> 53:12.880]  a person is a function and that's it. It's not that many of you. But as you grow, it makes sense.
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.760]  People think it's logical now, okay, now we have to divide according to where the money comes from.
[53:17.760 --> 53:21.760]  So if, you know, if we've got a product, okay, if we're going to put somebody in charge of that
[53:21.760 --> 53:26.240]  product, I'm going to put somebody in, if it's in fact geographical because your sales structure
[53:26.240 --> 53:31.040]  is that way, then you do geographical segments or, or something like that and then you organize
[53:31.040 --> 53:37.440]  according to whatever means you decide the money comes in. And that's the thing is that the money
[53:37.440 --> 53:43.760]  starts to lead your thinking and, and, and optimization becomes the, the rule of the day. It's like,
[53:43.760 --> 53:50.160]  how can I hold that person responsible to do the best thing for that, for that particular flow of
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.320]  money that's coming in to optimize it. And so, and so that's how the visional organizations
[53:56.320 --> 54:02.720]  involved in, in fact, general motors was probably the pioneer in that area back at, you know,
[54:02.720 --> 54:12.640]  100 years ago or so or so. So this idea of, of divisional logic is, is pervasive in the world.
[54:12.640 --> 54:17.360]  And, and it, it also makes sense when you're managing people in the thousands and thousands of
[54:17.360 --> 54:23.200]  people, you want to be able to create the incentives for them to align according to certain goals.
[54:23.200 --> 54:30.640]  And, and so the pyramid of that division is, is set up so that everybody knows what the target is
[54:30.640 --> 54:36.800]  and therefore their, their paycheck is, is tied to that in some way. And, and so people then
[54:36.800 --> 54:40.960]  know what they're, what you don't need to tell them every day what to do. They'll have that in
[54:40.960 --> 54:46.800]  their incentives built in. But in, and that doesn't work for an organization where, which is like
[54:46.800 --> 54:51.360]  Apple, which is functional because you're not attached to a product, you might be one day, but not
[54:51.360 --> 54:58.160]  the other. And then, and then you're, you're sort of, you never even part of the P&L logic is that
[54:58.160 --> 55:05.120]  you, you, you, you report some of that data and people know how things are going and, and so
[55:05.120 --> 55:11.200]  there's a communication happens through the knowledge of what's happening, right? And, and so
[55:12.400 --> 55:19.520]  bottom line is that Apple's lack of a P&L, a structure means that people within the organization
[55:19.520 --> 55:24.880]  will, you'll have hard time motivating them. You'll have a hard time figuring out what their
[55:24.880 --> 55:31.040]  responsibilities are, figuring out how they can navigate their own personal careers so that they
[55:31.040 --> 55:37.680]  can, they can maybe optimize their own career because the signal of pricing and the signal of
[55:37.680 --> 55:43.840]  profit was used to guide you. And, or would guide you if you were in a division organization all
[55:43.840 --> 55:51.840]  and so we have to be impressed by is how actually difficult it is to do what Apple's doing because
[55:51.840 --> 55:57.680]  it actually makes running that business really, really hard. And in fact, it may cause some people
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.960]  to just say, I quit, I, this doesn't, I can't, I can't make sense of it. I can't progress in my
[56:02.960 --> 56:09.040]  career because of this. And so there's a lot of heartache that comes with it. And there's a lot of
[56:09.040 --> 56:15.040]  chaos that comes with it. And so this is why every company it gets grows up beyond the same stage
[56:15.040 --> 56:20.960]  of bandits this logic. And here's Apple, which is now, I don't know how many 50,000 or more people
[56:20.960 --> 56:26.560]  is still able to continue in that way. It's hard to put a head count on Apple. Yeah. And that's
[56:26.560 --> 56:32.800]  you six separate the retail out for it. I think you might be right that it's probably 50 or 60 now.
[56:32.800 --> 56:39.200]  It's, it's explosively grown, eat non retail has grown tremendously in the last five years.
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.800]  Yeah. It was, I think it was Don Melton who pointed this out to me and said, you know,
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.400]  Apple is the largest functional organization outside of the US Army. It may be other foreign armies,
[56:48.400 --> 56:53.760]  but the idea is that and then you I saw, oh, and that, that when he said that in my head went like
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.040]  pop because I said, holy cow, that's exactly why armies are the way they are. I mean, the armies
[56:59.040 --> 57:05.120]  are the way they are. They're actually organized the way they are because they need to be,
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.760]  you know, thrown at a target. They're thrown at a mission. And they have to execute on that
[57:09.760 --> 57:15.520]  mission. But they're very inefficient in terms of, you know, trying to do a blend of things.
[57:15.520 --> 57:20.000]  And often even when you go into the into that mission, it's like it's chaos. It's like crazy,
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.480]  you know, in competencies emerge. And then you realize that, oh, okay, that's why we can have
[57:24.480 --> 57:28.720]  war games to simulate them and sort of make sure that things run effectively and so on.
[57:28.720 --> 57:34.160]  And so, you know, I got into this whole train of thought about whether what would happen
[57:34.160 --> 57:38.640]  if the US Army was divisional. Then you would have the head of, you know, the head of certain
[57:38.640 --> 57:43.120]  types of missions. So you would say, you know, we're not have air force, Marines and Army. We're
[57:43.120 --> 57:51.040]  going to have a guy in a charge of attacks in the Middle East. And we're going to have a
[57:51.040 --> 57:56.400]  guy in charge of maybe, you know, we'll do a geographically Latin America. And the head of Latin America
[57:56.400 --> 58:01.600]  would have under him, you know, Army Air Force and Marines. But the problem is that that person
[58:01.600 --> 58:05.440]  would gain so much power. Then they would start the joint chiefs of staff would kind of have
[58:05.440 --> 58:09.760]  these debates around a big table and say, you know, you know, Middle East is much more important.
[58:09.760 --> 58:15.760]  I ought to get more resources. So, so why don't you, you know, put 80% of the budget in the
[58:15.760 --> 58:21.280]  Middle East this year, Mr. President. And, and, you know, nobody cares about Latin America.
[58:21.280 --> 58:27.200]  All they're doing is, is, is busting drug gangs. You know, I got a real fight here to fight. So,
[58:27.200 --> 58:32.080]  so give me more money. So then we get into that. And then so one general who ran that region
[58:32.080 --> 58:37.040]  and suddenly have so much more power than the other generals, he could actually probably run,
[58:37.040 --> 58:43.440]  you know, do, run his own empire, run his own, make, make, make, make so many decisions that
[58:43.440 --> 58:48.400]  he would become like the King of the Middle East. In fact, MacArthur was like that in Japan. He had
[58:48.400 --> 58:53.760]  so much authority in Japan after the war that he wrote their constitution for them practically.
[58:53.760 --> 58:59.600]  And he was a general. And so that was a special situation. But when you think about it that way,
[58:59.600 --> 59:06.640]  that this is this, this, this idea of people who have under them an empire. This is the politics,
[59:06.640 --> 59:12.560]  that this is the type of politics that, that drives organizations into all this, all this paralysis,
[59:12.560 --> 59:18.000]  all of this mismanagement and all of this running off a cliff and stupidity that we observe.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.560]  And, and so because someone has that power structure in them, you can imagine this in Microsoft's
[59:22.560 --> 59:26.480]  world, you know, well, the windows guys are really powerful and the office guys are really powerful
[59:26.480 --> 59:31.040]  and they need all their resources because they've earned them. And so, and so it goes. But when
[59:31.040 --> 59:36.400]  you take that away, you depoliticize on organization. So you, especially with the military,
[59:36.400 --> 59:42.640]  you've got to be depoliticized, a politicized military turns into a, a, an object of, of, of,
[59:42.640 --> 59:48.560]  cool and, and this is why you have Republican guards and things like that, which are politicized
[59:48.560 --> 59:54.000]  militaries, which often end up really controlling the state. And in a democracy that's, that's,
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.720]  that's unacceptable. And for that reason, the militaries and democracies are the way they are.
[59:58.720 --> 1:00:02.720]  And, and this is, you know, let's long narrative. But I, I, I, sorry.
[1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:08.560]  Well, and not to go too deep down the historical rabbit hole, but that's why Harry Truman
[1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:13.280]  fired General McLean. Exactly. I mean, which Harry Truman, that's one of those things where I grew
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:16.960]  up and I heard this story and I thought, well, I guess that's the sort of thing that happens. But
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:21.920]  then like the, the older I get in the more perspective I get on it, it was sort of a bombshell,
[1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:28.720]  you know, to the US public who, who viewed viewed him as a, you know, as a viewer. He was a
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:33.760]  wartime hero. He hit, he'd not only had beaten Japan, but he also, he would have beaten Korea.
[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:38.800]  And, and, and, and so, or North North Korea. And he, he getting fired. I mean, I was so many
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:44.160]  people were upset, but he became too political and that was unacceptable in a democracy.
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:50.480]  And that, that to me was, was a great story to tell. And, and, and I think that's where you got
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:55.920]  to watch out. This is the day to day fears and worries that a, that a guy like Tim Cook has to deal
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:00.240]  with. It's, it's, he's got to worry about, and I think, you know, the four-stalled story, I think,
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:06.160]  had a lot to do with whether that general became too political and didn't stick to his
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:11.360]  functional role. In that case, he had to be sacrificed, even though everybody loved him.
[1:01:12.400 --> 1:01:17.440]  So, you know, it's the same story. I mean, I think of him as the Truman of, of Apple.
[1:01:17.440 --> 1:01:21.200]  Yeah. And as the more time is gained from that, the less.
[1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:24.800]  Oh, not Truman. Sorry, McCarthy. Right. Right. Right. Exactly. But I thought you
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:28.800]  meant Cook as the Truman, which is a true. True. Yeah. Cook as the Truman and, and, and forced
[1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:33.360]  all was, it was my car. Right. Now, that's the, the more I see it though, it's, it's not just,
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:41.360]  at first, I viewed it as sort of a petty, more of a petty disagreement between a few individuals.
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:46.880]  And I think that there's something to that angle. Um, but I feel like long-term strategically,
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:54.880]  it was about making sure that the institution of the whole company was, was truly more
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:00.560]  functional. Whereas I feel like under Steve Jobs, a lot of the functional nature of Apple
[1:02:00.560 --> 1:02:07.040]  came down to jobs as singular role in a company. Not, not to say that the company depended on him
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:11.760]  and couldn't, you know, that he was a cornerstone that the company couldn't do without. I think
[1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:17.360]  we're seeing that that's not true. But I think that the functional nature of the company flew through
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:22.880]  him. Yeah. And, yeah. No, you're, you're right. There's subtle differences of, we generalize,
[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:29.200]  and we use, we use metaphor, and we use, we use allegory. But the truth is, is far more complex.
[1:02:29.200 --> 1:02:34.800]  And so I don't want to be, I don't want to make it seem like it's so clear cut, that,
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.760]  that, you know, this is, this tells the story. But it's only illustrative. For example, just as a,
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:44.800]  as an anomaly, as a counterpoint to, to the functional thing, there's, there's, uh,
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:53.120]  eddy cues organization because eddy cue, uh, I see it as an empire because he's got under him. Services
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:03:01.200]  now called and includes, uh, all the stores and includes iWork. It includes the, um, the new,
[1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:08.960]  it includes Apple TV. It includes, uh, products that are hardware software and services.
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:13.520]  And that is, that is, it could, you know, if you could spin off to eddy cue, you know, it would be a
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:18.320]  huge business. It would be a business bigger than Amazon, in my opinion. Uh, I could,
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:22.880]  and pardon, it probably dig up some numbers that would show that, that, that, uh, eddy cues
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:28.880]  organization, a by itself, uh, you know, would be valued by the market far with the, with the
[1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:34.080]  goods chunk of multiple would be, would be far in excess than what it is inside Apple. But that,
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:37.760]  of course, that's not going to happen. The point is though, that is an exception to rule. And,
[1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:41.600]  and there is a good reason for that because there is this kind of like, what do you do with these
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:48.960]  pieces problem? And so, and so in some ways they're, they're, they're put under him. And so,
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:54.320]  if it happens, there's a reorg, uh, I would be surprised because there's something may just get out of
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:58.800]  control there. I don't know. I'm not, I'm not prejudicing hopefully anything. I think what's,
[1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:04.320]  what's so funny with Apple today, it would be, it would be almost impossible to reorganize the company.
[1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:09.600]  I think what they could do is, is there could be like, uh, departures, individuals could depart,
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:15.120]  maybe just simply to enjoy their retirement, enjoy the, you know, the, the wealth that they've
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:22.640]  accumulated. Um, or it could be another dispute arises where there's a personality conflict between
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:28.240]  two senior vice presidents who need to be working together and can't get along. But I,
[1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:36.720]  to me, it would just be, it's almost more like running like sports, you know, like pick any sport,
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.120]  you know, like you, if you want to talk about soccer, like, well, we're going to have to change
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:48.080]  goalkeepers. It's, but it's still the same position. You're not really. You're, you're, you're
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:55.360]  absolutely, you're saying it right. I, I, I just, I, literally, I, uh, on the spot thought of the,
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:05:00.000]  the reorg idea and I don't, I, I, on reflection, I think you're right. It's not going to be what
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  we think of as a reorg. It might just be that, that maybe they'll carve, maybe they could do something
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:13.680]  with, with services that's going to grow into such an extent that they, um, may, um, make,
[1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:17.840]  create that as a separate thing. I don't know. I don't, I'm just being completely speculative.
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:23.520]  Yeah. Uh, let me take another break here. We'll take a deep breath and I'll thank our second sponsor
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:30.960]  and it's another long time friend of the show are good friends at Fracture. It is sad.
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:37.440]  I honestly think it is that so many of our photos that we take today, people, everybody,
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:43.120]  almost everybody I know takes more photographs today than they ever have before in their lives
[1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:48.640]  and it's only, it's only becoming more prevalent and it's easy to see why it's because we all have
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:55.040]  really good cameras with us all the time, like two or three seconds away from being ready to snap
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:06:05.280]  a photo. Um, and yet so many of the photos that we take, uh, never really leave the devices that,
[1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:10.560]  that we view them on. They're just digital things that we see on digital devices when we look for
[1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:15.360]  them. Um, and I think it's actually true. I think it's even true for me personally as somebody who
[1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:20.640]  uses Fracture and has Fracture prints and, and, and, you know, talks about them all the time here
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:27.200]  that I've actually got fewer printed photos now when I take more photos than I did 10, 11, 12 years
[1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:33.360]  ago when, uh, I used to shoot on film and I had to have prints of everything made. There's something
[1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:37.920]  magical about a printed photograph when it's something that means something to you. That's where
[1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:44.800]  Fracture steps in. Fracture prints your photos directly on pure glass. You'd pick your favorite
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:51.440]  photos that you've taken. You send them to Fracture and the prints come back to you printed directly
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:55.520]  on glass. Not a piece of paper attached to glass. They just print right on the glass. I don't know
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:07:00.720]  what kind of voodoo they used to do it, but it looks great. The prints come back to you. They've
[1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:07.360]  got a foam back right on the glass that's ready to mount on a wall, uh, or ready to be used. It's
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:13.840]  this ingenious ingenious packaging that you can use to mount it on a wall or to prop it up on a shelf
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:19.840]  or your desk or the mantel or wherever you want to put it up, uh, right out of the box. So you don't
[1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:25.360]  need to put them in a frame. You don't need to buy a separate frame. The picture itself is all you
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:31.200]  need to mount it on a wall, hang it up, uh, really looks great. And it gives your photos the analog
[1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:37.440]  beauty that they deserve. Um, so go check them out. Take some photos, uh, or take some of your recent
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:45.520]  photos. Pick a few that are your favorites. Go to, uh, fractureme.com, fractureme.com. That's
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:54.160]  their website. Uh, and use the code daring fireball. Use that code and you'll get 15% off your first
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:58.880]  order from fracture. Their prices are already great, but you can say 15% using the code daring
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:09.440]  fireball. So Mike, my thanks to fracture. So, uh, it's speaking about not putting everything off
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:14.960]  in its own P&L profit and loss and looking at things, you know, functionally. You, you wrote a
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:23.280]  recent, uh, piece on a simcote about maps and this sort of, um, well, more like one factor,
[1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:28.400]  how much does it cost to run a top notch mapping service per year? And you came to the conclusion
[1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:35.520]  that it costs about two billion dollars a year. Yeah. I think it, it used to be one, but it's
[1:08:35.520 --> 1:08:40.960]  closer to two now. And I think that, and I got that figure by looking at the financials that, uh,
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:47.040]  that Nokia was reporting for its here product, uh, or here division, which was an acquisition,
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:55.760]  uh, back in 2007, actually the year the iPhone launched. Nokia spent a seven billion dollars
[1:08:55.760 --> 1:09:01.360]  or a year as I forget on the acquisition of MAFTEC, which was at the time, probably the best
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:09.680]  map service in the world. And I mean that because I was using maps in 2005 and six on a mobile
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:19.360]  device. Um, uh, I have a phone back in the pre iPhone, dark ages. And, um, I remember using Google
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:28.640]  Maps back then. And it was horrifically bad. I think Google Google Maps was, um, laughably bad
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:35.760]  compared to paid services or things you could purchase by, you could download the entire maps.
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:42.160]  Like, you know, remember Tom Tom and, and sure, uh, those, you know, Garmin, those guys had a
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:49.600]  dumb or they had a an embedded map in, in their, in their hardware. Or if you had an in-car system
[1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:54.400]  like, uh, like you would have with a high-end car back in the day, you would pay three, four thousand
[1:09:54.400 --> 1:10:00.880]  dollars for the, uh, onboard navigation, which was a DVD usually. That was, you know, that was
[1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:05.840]  an upgradeable that you paid. That's exactly what I, we bought the car that we have, uh, we bought
[1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:12.480]  in 2006. We're still driving it. Uh, and I think we turned down. It was a four thousand dollar upgrade
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:18.240]  to get in board navigation. Which in hindsight, for never a couple of years there where my wife
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:23.120]  gave me a hard time about that. And in hindsight really looks like a, a very good decision.
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:28.320]  And that the time you could get a handheld, uh, navigator, uh, and you, or you could get like,
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:34.480]  very rarely. And these were only in some Nokia devices that you could get usually was an SD card
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:39.600]  that had maps data for the region you're in. And you could pop that in very few. Actually none,
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:44.880]  I think, were directly over the air. Google started offering over the air. But again, it was
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:49.120]  hard. But I remember using it in, in those years, I was in, uh, I was in Boston. I was actually
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:56.720]  working at Nokia's offices over in, uh, uh, by 128. And I remember using it every, every afternoon
[1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:03.440]  going home. I would open it up on, uh, a Nokia sort of blackberry-style phone. And I would have this
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:08.880]  tiny square screen. And I would pop in, uh, through the, through the online, uh, through the,
[1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:15.440]  sorry, through through the network at the time, which would have been probably 2G or 2.5G. And I
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:20.640]  would get to see my route home. And I would look for the traffic data because there was, that was,
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:25.040]  that was really the only value for me is like how bad was the traffic when I would have, when I
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:31.280]  would drive home. But that was it. That was no really discovering where to go eat or anything like that.
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:40.160]  That was a map space. So at that time, at that time, um, uh, app, you know, Nokia thought we've
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:45.920]  got to spend seven billion dollars on maps. And the, the thing about Nokia, uh, throughout the
[1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:50.640]  years I was there is that they were really, really forward thinking. Uh, they were thought about
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:55.920]  smartphones 10 years before anybody else did. They thought about maps 10 years before they got good
[1:11:55.920 --> 1:12:03.200]  enough. And if anything, they just were too early on everything. Uh, and, and then focus on the
[1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:08.000]  things that needed to be improved, rather they said, okay, we buy the assets or we commit to the
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:14.080]  strategy. And they, they, they thought that was enough. Uh, they didn't have the ability to really,
[1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:20.960]  really get their, uh, get the things sorted out. So, so, so long story short, so, so they
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:26.560]  buy an affect for, for billions of dollars. Uh, and then they would report their revenues and
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.680]  they would report their costs. So from that we could work out just how much they were spending
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:38.480]  to maintain that seven billion dollar asset to maintain the data in it. And of course, nowadays,
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:44.000]  people would say that here maps is not as good. By the way, here, the maps business did have
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.080]  revenues for them because they were selling these data sets to the car makers. So they were selling
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:55.200]  them to Mercedes and Porsche and whoever to put on those DVDs in their cars and put in the SD
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:00.880]  cards if you were to willing to, you know, buy that service. So in the after-ex business was a real
[1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:06.800]  business. It wasn't an ad-driven business. It wasn't based on, on selling devices. It was based
[1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:14.400]  on selling the actually hard earned data. And they had 400 people who every day got into cars
[1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:20.800]  to go collect data by driving around. And they would also source data from satellites. They would
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:25.920]  source data from, I mean, satellite companies. They would source data from geo-position. And
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:30.880]  there was, there was this huge data sets that mostly were not consumer-based, right? These were for
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:37.040]  companies. And, and so, so this was an amazingly valuable idea that, that maps are going to be
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:42.480]  someday very important in mobile. And that maps, therefore, the Nokia thought by owning that asset
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:47.520]  and there weren't very many others. You know, in fact, they were coming with the baggage of
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:53.600]  hardware, like by Garmin and Tom Tom. And so instead they said, no, there's a pure, pure asset,
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:57.200]  we're going to buy it and we're going to be the best map service in the world. And at that time,
[1:13:57.200 --> 1:14:03.280]  what I argue, yes, they were. Google was a joke. And, and the funny thing to me was a few years
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:08.880]  later when finally Apple gets into the maps business, people say that their maps are a joke.
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:14.320]  And I just remembered Google. I didn't, I didn't think that that was a relevant argument because
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:19.920]  I remembered that Google got better. So the only question in my mind was not, are they any good
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:23.200]  at the launch? Of course, they're not good at the launch. They're just getting started on
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:28.320]  something that people have been doing for 20 years. And Google itself had been doing for seven years
[1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:32.160]  or six years. And of course, Google had a six year lead. And of course, they're going to be better.
[1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:37.680]  And so, and let's look at it six years from now. And so, and so, and I knew that they would have
[1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:44.560]  to spend the kind of money that then that just to maintain the here maps service or an
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:49.280]  app that cost a billion dollars a year. So you know that to obtain the depth of knowledge that
[1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:54.720]  that the catch up, you'd have to be spending more than that. Now, no one's confirmed or denied the
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:15:01.600]  two billion figure. But I, you know, I would say that's credible. The amount of effort going in
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  is at that level. And so that's how I got that number. I will put a link to the piece in the
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.440]  show notes. I know I often say that when I forget to, but I've already got it in my notes. So
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:16.320]  it'll be there. But you make a good case for why it's I think in the ballpark, it's got to be pretty
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:22.960]  close. And there is a lot, it's just a lot of ongoing legwork to run a modern mapping service. I mean,
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.960]  you need those drivers out on the streets taking the pictures of the stores. And I'll give you,
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:34.560]  I'll give you another example. And this is from a friend of mine who I met at actually at the
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:43.200]  last time that was at all, you know, Paul Campbell's show in Ireland. And he ran a service in
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:48.000]  Prague, here's America. He ran a service in Prague, Germany. Oh, so Prague, Czech Republic,
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:59.280]  sir, where he would pay college students to walk around the city and make notes about the opening
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:05.440]  times of every restaurant, every place you could walk bar, everything you could walk into. So the
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:14.160]  address and the details about, you know, what was on the door that gave you information that was
[1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:19.600]  about that establishment. And so he would aggregate that data and overlay it on public open source
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:28.800]  maps and provide that as a tourist atlas. So he would let you download. So you would download this
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:33.760]  and not pay roaming charges. So imagine you're visiting from Italy to Prague and you're in the
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:39.440]  Italian and you get the map of Prague from him. And it gives you this level of detail. Now,
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:44.000]  the reason he was in business is because Google Maps would have cost you a lot in roaming fees.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:49.120]  So in Europe, it made sense that you could do every city this way. But then the real amazing story
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:55.440]  he told me was that Google came to him and said, why don't you just license all this data to us?
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:00.480]  They didn't have it. Google didn't have this data. So he did a deal with Google where he's,
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:04.320]  you know, and he felt he had he had been wronged in it because they offered him like, well,
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:08.240]  just put your name down at the bottom of each page. We won't pay you anything. We'll put your
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:13.760]  name down at the bottom. And so that'll be a link. So you're going to get a lot of business from
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:19.920]  from being exposed via Google Maps. And it turned out that that was worth very much. So he felt
[1:17:19.920 --> 1:17:27.520]  that that was a bad deal and got out of it later. But the idea is then that Google itself,
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:34.800]  in order to get this information, does all kinds of deals? Either sense people on its own or
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:40.080]  in this case, through another person who did all this work, has college students doing,
[1:17:40.080 --> 1:17:44.480]  because college students are fairly cheap and they're going around by foot anyway, walking around
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:49.440]  the city, thinking they're discovering the world. And by the way, here, you're going to be paid
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:54.800]  a couple of dollars if you if you if you jot down this data every time you pass a doorway. And so
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:03.040]  this this model of really low level crowdsourcing data is truly labor intensive. And it ends up
[1:18:03.040 --> 1:18:07.600]  costing a lot of money and then cleaning it up and so in sending it all to India to have it to
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:14.160]  have it rationalized and fixed and all that stuff. So there's a huge amount of effort there as
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:19.920]  well. And then they then they go off and and do 3d then they go off and do do underground and
[1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:25.120]  internal maps. And then you know on and on it goes the demands of these maps are suddenly we want
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:33.280]  to have every single thing we want flyovers. We want we want you know vector maps. We don't
[1:18:33.280 --> 1:18:38.480]  we're not happy with bitmaps, right? So all of that adds a huge amount of cost and and and so
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:45.280]  if this is the game, you wonder then why are they doing it? Because you've got to make the money
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:54.080]  back somehow and and it gets tough to understand a logic that that that that exists besides the
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:59.760]  ones we see now which are basically Google Maps advertising based and Apple essentially saying that
[1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:07.120]  our devices are worth it. And and so I asked a question what else can we expect for business models
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:11.920]  as far as maps are concerned into the future. And I lead to you know thinking about transportation
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:17.920]  and and autonomous vehicles. Yeah. Well it's part of your analysis and I love this. I never really
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:22.080]  thought about it. But if you if you know starting with the idea that it takes about two billion
[1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:28.400]  dollars per year to maintain a modern mapping service that you can work out rough estimates of how
[1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:34.960]  many users the major mapping services have. And then you can divide and figure out what is a cost
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:41.200]  per user per year and your your estimates you come out with the so Google Maps is the leading map
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:48.320]  service in in the world. Cost about cost them about two dollars per user per year. So to be profitable
[1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:53.440]  now I'm reading right from your post. Google would need to find ad revenues of two dollars per
[1:19:53.440 --> 1:20:02.560]  user per year. With Apple with fewer users but with a majority of iOS users by all accounts
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:11.200]  their Apple is spending about six seven dollars a year per user per year. And to make to justify
[1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:17.600]  that they really just need to you know find six or seven dollars of value in the iPads and iPhones
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:22.880]  that people are buying which I you know as you said certainly seems reasonable. And then you get
[1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:32.080]  to Nokia here and it's costing them sixty six dollars per year per user because they've only got
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:38.080]  thirty million users at this point. And if you were to bundle it with with with the old Nokia I mean
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:43.840]  Microsoft Nokia because actually now they exist without any users so they're having what they're
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:49.120]  doing is they licensed it to Microsoft. So Microsoft is a probably only paying Nokia you know a
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:55.840]  couple of dollars like they would let's say for for a let's say a blend between Apple and Google
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:00.480]  like some let's say five bucks a year for per user. And that just doesn't cover their costs so
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:04.720]  they'd have to find other revenue and they do like I said they always been selling to to car makers
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:11.040]  but that makes it you know that's why the car in that you know that's why the car guys are
[1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:17.920]  selling you know asking four thousand dollars that you know they probably paying the data vendor like three four
[1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:23.360]  hundred dollars per you know their markups are huge and they're very inefficient but but that that's
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:28.960]  the that's per vehicle pricing it's probably in the hundreds of dollars but again long now it's
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:35.520]  up for sale and it's still losing money as it is right and the question I you know this is why
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:41.840]  people would ask me why doesn't why doesn't Apple buy buy Nokia's here and I you know I would say
[1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:46.800]  well look it's up for sale for three billion dollars and then there's like there's no deal yet but
[1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:50.640]  but somebody supposedly is bidding three billion dollars and something that a few years ago
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:54.960]  cost seven billion dollars and suddenly we're saying is absolutely a hygiene factor as far as
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:22:00.320]  platforms are concerned if you don't have this you're you're you're you're a non-player and Apple is
[1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:05.120]  desperate and so on and so on all of these things make no sense when you look at the when you follow
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:10.160]  the money and you say here's somebody could just buy the third best Apple you know the third best
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:17.040]  mapping system and probably you know having the longest legacy actually and no one wants it
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.560]  why is that why these things don't make sense to to you know when you reconcile the dollars
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:31.040]  and you reconcile against the supposed value and in in in that what is it the invaluable nature
[1:22:31.040 --> 1:22:37.360]  of maps as a strategic asset and so I I I point out that well the guys who are in it already
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:41.760]  have already decided and committed to this strategy and they're putting their own people to work
[1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:46.000]  on it and that this would not help them very much so the only question is would there be a
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:50.640]  third party that wants to get into this business but they have to discover business model
[1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:55.920]  that's the question if Uber and Uber is one of the candidates that's being put forward I
[1:22:55.920 --> 1:23:02.160]  maybe it's it's not true but I the rumors say that Uber is interested or the car makers as a group
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:07.360]  would go and buy this mapping thing that's up for grabs but they would have to come up with how
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:13.120]  do we make sure we're profitable to burning up to a two billion dollars or you to keep the service
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:22.400]  competitive and and the answer would have to be that they have to get into some way of monetizing
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:28.720]  our economies autonomous vehicles and I both have an interest in that yeah because it kills it can
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:34.560]  kill a bunch of birds and maybe more than two birds with one stone where the autonomous vehicles
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:41.920]  and you see you know it's no secret that that Uber is getting into package delivery and stuff
[1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:46.720]  like that and that Amazon you know it's it a whole bunch of different companies are converging on
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:54.000]  the same idea and that Amazon is investigating new ways to deliver packages to people that without
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.440]  going through UPS or something like that actually had an uncomfortable conversation with my UPS
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:06.480]  guy the other day where there was a package from Amazon that was left at our door and then the
[1:24:06.480 --> 1:24:12.320]  UPS guy came and ran the doorbell and had another one and that's very unlike UPS UPS is usually
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:17.280]  very very efficient at bundling two things you know if you have two different orders coming that they
[1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:23.920]  come in at one time and you know and he mentioned you know that he said he thought I wasn't home
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:28.560]  because that you know that Amazon package had already been left there by somebody else at my front door
[1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:34.880]  clearly not delivered by UPS but anyway all these things people getting driven around
[1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:40.640]  and not owning cars this whole idea that if you live in an urban environment you you can use Uber
[1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:46.720]  instead of owning a car and you actually save money you can save a lot of money compared to the
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:53.120]  the monthly cost of owning a car and combine that with the fact that these cars could do
[1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:58.240]  the work of taking the pictures and stuff like that as they drive around the area
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:03.920]  oh yeah and that's the thing and in fact this professor at NYU Galaway
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:10.320]  Scott Galaway yeah great you know he great guy and you should probably interview him in yeah yeah
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:16.960]  he's on the knowledge and if you know he points out that that Uber is potentially disruptive to
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:21.840]  to Amazon because when you break Amazon down besides having a discovery engine for you know
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:28.400]  for the website it's really a massive operations and distribution center and in fact that's
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:34.160]  where a lot of their money goes there a lot of their their capex or capital expenses are in setting
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:39.600]  up distribution centers globally and they're very expensive and they're somewhat even robotic
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:45.840]  they have robots and stuff in them and so that's a that's a that's a high cost thing and they're
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.720]  doing it because really that's that's how they get the growth thing you know they have to get
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:57.920]  these packages into to from a lot of points to a lot of points and the thing is that that's exactly
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:02.960]  what Uber does now it doesn't have the storefront but it's actually probably easier for them to
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:09.600]  do a storefront than than then then it would be to build the infrastructure that that they're
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:15.200]  disrupting so it's it's it's fascinating I think Uber is one of the most disruptive ideas ever
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:20.960]  and and so that's why you know they would come to the maps question with a different set of
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:25.600]  priorities not so much about monetizing them the way the other two are doing it but rather that
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.680]  saying hey you know this is actually exactly in the direction we want to go we want to be a logistics
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:36.880]  company we want to be a transportation company we want to be a potentially even a vehicle company
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:42.160]  and so and so all of that in the maps enables that yeah make and of course the car makers are in
[1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:46.880]  you know are in it for the same obvious reasons that they've always been yeah it makes a lot of
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:53.200]  sense to me intuitively that if somebody else we're going to start you know like let's just say
[1:26:53.200 --> 1:27:03.120]  Uber to be a third major maps company that they would have a third different revenue model right
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:08.000]  so there's Google that's doing it with advertising and just sort of we'll we'll put our maps
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.880]  anywhere and everywhere we can and get the most people we possibly can and we're going to make
[1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:17.440]  that money back by advertising and we really only need to sell a few dollars and adds per
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:22.320]  user per year to make this to make this work there's the Apple model which is we're going to use
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:29.840]  this as a value add to our premium products and I don't feel like anybody is going to catch Google
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:35.040]  or Apple in either of those ways soon and so it makes sense to me that if somebody's going to be a
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:40.560]  strong number three that it would be with an entirely different model like Cooper yeah that's
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:46.880]  what I'm saying by the title is like where maps are going is where we're you know in the sense
[1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:52.080]  of obtaining value from transportation by the way it's possible that both Apple and Google also
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:56.880]  have that in mind because they're going to potentially enable vehicles either of their own design
[1:27:56.880 --> 1:28:03.280]  or licensing it for that and and the other thing that I found fascinating and I don't remember
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:09.760]  where I read it but it was a wonderful expose which said that really the key to the autonomous
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:15.760]  vehicle the self-driving cars that Google is is now field testing is not that they have this
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:23.120]  amazing algorithm that it recognizes the world and is able to act as if we do in terms of avoiding
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:30.400]  avoiding an accident but rather that they compare what they see with what this stored and what
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:37.920]  this stored is essentially hyper hyper high resolution map of the streets so imagine that the
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:43.200]  vehicles drive over the same spot many times they always take a picture and then they upload it
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:49.440]  and that is what's stored as the this is the world the way it looks now compare that the way
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:55.120]  the world looks with what you're seeing at this moment if they don't match then there's an obstacle
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:28:59.680]  so that's the way they determine whether there's an obstacle in the way because there is this kind
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:05.520]  of comparison being done rather than saying oh I see this blob I'm going to use my artificial
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:12.880]  intelligence to determine if the blob is a person or an animal or you know a boulder it's really
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:19.200]  about this kind of differential they're able to do so it's really much more brute force than
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:27.600]  than we think and probably more effective by the way in less error prone than then then this
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:33.760]  idea of really machine learning about driving and and so it's very data driven in that but the
[1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:40.480]  boils it boils down to therefore really having super hyper accurate maps like down to the centimeter
[1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:44.160]  in terms of resolution rather than what we see now which is down to the meter
[1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:53.280]  and also not just street view imagine street view with the ability to see every cent every square
[1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:59.200]  centimeter of the world as you're moving along at 60 frames a second and so you're doing that
[1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:05.920]  comparison continuously and therefore you're able to really have that autonomous machine and
[1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:11.120]  this is why also it's very difficult the one of the side effects is that the unless you have a
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:19.040]  map of the inside of a parking garage the car cannot go there the car can only go in places that
[1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:25.200]  have been pre mapped and pre visualized and so that's why maps are so important to autonomous
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:31.040]  vehicles it's because the algorithms depend on having a very hyper accurate view of the world and
[1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:38.640]  so if either if either three of these three contenders right a google apple and uber who wanted
[1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:44.560]  want to become potentially again there's a lot of hypothesis here potentially suppliers of
[1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:49.840]  infra may or or transportation services then you get into this whole question of how good are
[1:30:49.840 --> 1:30:55.360]  your maps they have to control the maps and in fact maps are not good enough so they can't just
[1:30:55.360 --> 1:31:00.080]  go oh well we'll just we'll just get somebody to do it for us now we've got to have to figure this
[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:05.520]  out so so that's why i think part of these vans you see that apple drives around and we think of
[1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:10.560]  them as being well they're just doing street view well street view is the is the baby version of
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:14.000]  the what what's gonna be necessary if you're gonna have autonomous vehicle it's a great point let's
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:18.880]  keep going on this but before we do i want to thank our third and final sponsor and it's our good
[1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:27.520]  friends at Casper Casper makes obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices
[1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:36.160]  just the right sink just the right bounce they combine two technologies to make one mattress you
[1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:41.360]  don't have to go there and pick like oh do you want mattress a or mattress b battery c you just pick a
[1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:47.600]  size and all their mattresses have the same exact feel to them using two technologies latex foam
[1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:55.200]  and memory foam put together with just the right mix of how much of each style to make a perfect
[1:31:55.200 --> 1:32:02.160]  mattress now again buying a mattress all this stuff you can buy online sounds crazy well why
[1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:07.840]  no world would you buy a mattress online if you can't feel it can't try it here's the thing they
[1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:14.400]  have a risk-free trial and return policy you try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days
[1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:21.120]  and that's with free delivery and painless free return so 99 days into it you don't like it you
[1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:26.320]  think this is this is not a this was not a good mattress you just go to their website and say
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:32.320]  you know set up a thing they'll come pick up the mattress take it out of there that's how confident
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:37.280]  though they are in the mattress now when they first started sponsoring a show i forget what the
[1:32:37.840 --> 1:32:42.480]  free trial period was but it was less than a hundred days and they extended it to a hundred days
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:47.840]  because that they've had so few returns because people buy these mattresses and love them
[1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:55.360]  their mattresses are made in america and the prices if you've ever if you shop for a mattress
[1:32:55.360 --> 1:33:02.560]  recently you'll see just how low these prices are 500 for a twin-size mattress up to 950
[1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:07.280]  for a king-size mattress so under a thousand dollars for a king-size mattress unheard of for a
[1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:14.560]  premium mattress compare that to the industry averages and it's just outstanding how do they
[1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:20.160]  deliver them it's this is part of the amazing part of this is is that by using these foam technologies
[1:33:20.160 --> 1:33:26.640]  latex foam and memory foam they can vacuum seal these mattresses into a shockingly small box it's
[1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:30.800]  a big box to get delivered it's probably the biggest package you'll get you know if you order one
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:35.040]  of these it's probably the biggest package you'll get all year but it's way smaller than the size
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:40.560]  of a mattress and so they have instructions on the box they tell you take it to the room where
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:45.040]  you want to have it take it to your bedroom and open the box there you definitely don't want to
[1:33:45.040 --> 1:33:49.520]  open it downstairs and then carry it upstairs because then you're stuck lugging a mattress size
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:54.560]  thing you open it up and it makes a cool sound as it soaks in the air and next thing you know you've
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:00.800]  got a full-size mattress really really good stuff I've got one it's really nice it's a great mattress
[1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:06.000]  could not be more convenient I just found out I did not know this I don't live in New York
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:12.400]  they've got a thing where if you live in New York City you can get one same day I believe and they
[1:34:12.400 --> 1:34:17.120]  actually deliver them this is how small the boxes are they get delivered by people on bicycles
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:22.560]  that it's so it's a big thing to lug on your back on a bike but it actually is that that convenient
[1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:29.760]  to ship around so here's the thing you can't lose you don't have to go to six different mattress
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:35.200]  stores and try six different mattresses and figure out which ones are equivalent between the two
[1:34:35.200 --> 1:34:44.480]  and price shop just go to Casper.com slash the talk show Casper CSPER.com slash the talk show
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:52.400]  figure out what size mattress you want in order it that's it now use that code the talk show I
[1:34:52.400 --> 1:34:57.040]  think it kicks in as long as you just use the URL but if you need the code it's the talk show
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:05.840]  and you save an additional 50 bucks off the price of any mattress so save 50 bucks they'll know
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:12.400]  you came from the show and you'll get a great mattress at a truly unbeatable price Casper.com slash
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:20.480]  the talk show so we're talking about maps I'm not sure if we have more to go on maps but it has
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:25.520]  occurred to me one thing I've looked at as I've been thinking about it more and more is that
[1:35:25.520 --> 1:35:32.800]  I'm slow to the uptake sometimes on revolutionary companies and Uber is one of them where Uber is a
[1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:37.520]  company where I've been using them for a while ever since especially since they came to Philadelphia
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:42.960]  but they've always been you know they started in San Francisco and San Francisco has well it's
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:48.240]  gotten better and it's because of Uber but San Francisco to me has always had some of the worst
[1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:54.800]  taxi cab service of any any city that I visit it's simply appalling compared to what I'm used to
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:36:00.160]  on the East Coast and so I was a big fan of Uber in San Francisco right from the get-go
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:08.880]  but I just I thought of them simply as a new fangled taxi company and that's it and I didn't
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:13.600]  look past that and it occurred to me that that's exactly how I used to see Amazon I was a very
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:19.760]  early adopter of Amazon for buying books but I saw them as a bookstore and then people would say
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:25.120]  oh Amazon has ambitions to do a lot more than just books and I would just roll my eyes and think
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:30.400]  whatever but it's a pretty it is a pretty cool bookstore I thought the same thing about Uber
[1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:36.080]  until recently but I see now that I think that they they sort of are like the inverse of Amazon
[1:36:39.040 --> 1:36:44.000]  and then you know what what's interesting when you think about trying to do this type of
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:50.320]  analysis of worth thing you know I always use some kind of you know biological metaphor like I
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:56.400]  say you know it's it's like it's like looking at a baby and saying that's pretty useless human
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:03.680]  being you know it's just like can't do anything I mean it's like this is a lot of the criticisms
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:08.480]  we get when not just when new companies are born but even when you products are born from
[1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:14.960]  established companies and we are we're just like it's useless you know like the Apple watch or the
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:20.240]  first iPhone or the first whatever I mean yeah some things Apple does we're much more meaningful
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:27.680]  but it's like the logic of it is that the the the writers say the magic of it is being able to
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:34.000]  look in the child's eyes and say that their lies you know a human being that's gonna live 90 years
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:39.840]  that's gonna have an amazing life that's gonna change the world and contribute so much to others
[1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:47.200]  and and and and and yet and yet that's not what comes in the mind even of the parent
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:53.120]  the the the stranger may just be ambivalent or you know a lot of young people who haven't
[1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:57.280]  you know you remember when you were when you were a teenager you didn't think babies were all
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:02.480]  that great but what when you're a when you're a parent age you've kind of really get a soft spot
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:07.840]  and then when it's your kid you're you're you're you're you're completely irrational about children
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:13.280]  but but the point I'm making is that we don't love children because of what they're gonna
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:20.720]  be necessarily we don't love our children because they're gonna grow up to be lawyers and doctors
[1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:25.040]  or that they're gonna help us in our old age we love them because it's just we love them
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:32.560]  and and the thing is that that um there's this this I'd like to propose that we treat
[1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:39.120]  startups and and and and young things in general with the same
[1:38:41.760 --> 1:38:48.080]  contemplation of their potential but also sort of saying well they're if valuable just because they
[1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:56.240]  exist you know they're just valuable because somebody took the effort of making it and and and and and
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:00.400]  you know that's worth a lot and um you know it's coming back to
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.680]  Pixar again remember in in Red to Tui and that speech of
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.560]  what was the name of the the the critic at the end he said you know
[1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:20.640]  nothing we do as critics is worth the crumbiest product we've ever visited or the crumbiest
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:27.760]  restaurant we've ever eaten that um because these people work to make it happen and all we do
[1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:35.600]  is consume the the result and and and mock it so we don't you know they deserve a lot more
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:42.320]  that we do but he said you know the value of the critic he continues is in discovering the new
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:50.560]  and uh that's that that was in the beautiful speech and uh uh I wish I would remember who wrote it
[1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:54.560]  but it was almost as if they were speaking to characters name was on a time ago
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:59.840]  portrait that's you know I remember that hitting home for me too because
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:07.280]  I clearly was self-aware enough to recognize that that's more or less the career that I've carved
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:15.440]  out for myself is you know effectively I'm a critic a a pundit on these things and then I do a lot
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:22.880]  more uh telling tell you know thinking about whether the work of other people is good or bad
[1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:28.960]  or how it could be improved then I do creating it myself and that you know I should remember that
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:34.160]  and keep that perspective and not never lose sight of the fact that what I say is not more
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:42.080]  important than the actual work itself yeah having said that so I you know I want to make sure that
[1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:48.320]  we give we give a lot of credit to those who stick their necks out but it's it's also important
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:53.760]  that when you when you look at something and you ask yourself what can it become that there are
[1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:59.680]  helpful hints um one thing you can study with a baby is they could study its parents I've often
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:04.720]  that's a great indicator of what they're gonna end up doing or how how well not always I mean maybe
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:12.080]  even if you have 20% chance it's better than zero though so so there's there's that and also
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:17.600]  sometimes you study the child and you see how whether they struggle through life and that usually
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:22.480]  tells you that they will do better than average because they they actually are learning
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:31.360]  through experience and and so when you see something like an uber you know you measure things
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:39.680]  like are they flexible are they driven are they are they do they have an ambition and fundamentally
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:48.160]  I think that disruptive theory that I'm a big fan of and I'm a big supporter and advocate of
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:56.400]  is that it gives you these hints about where things can go and the thinking around the analysis
[1:41:56.400 --> 1:42:02.160]  around an object like uber is that you know they're solving a job and that is to get people from
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:10.000]  point of point and that job today has an alternative called a car and it's really about understanding
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.720]  the substitution power that they have versus something that doesn't necessarily
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:22.720]  is not seen in the same category and this is when when you start to jump across markets and
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:27.520]  across categories and say you know actually this thing has the potential to be a threat to
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:34.880]  something that's completely unrelated and that's that that skill of understanding what it's really
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:40.720]  what's what it's really trying to do and what the customer we use the phrase what the customer
[1:42:40.720 --> 1:42:47.920]  hires the product to do and this is in the way of saying this is the jobs to be done methodologies
[1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:54.480]  like saying well you don't buy a drill you buy a hole in the wall and so if if and and and this
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:59.680]  has been an observation for many many decades ago that that which company sell isn't what what
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:05.920]  their buyers or their customers are buying so this distinction is important because those the
[1:43:05.920 --> 1:43:14.240]  capabilities that the that the seller have that has the capability that they say well we can make
[1:43:14.240 --> 1:43:18.560]  this but then the other person on the other side who receives the product is saying well what I
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:23.040]  really need is something else but thanks I'll take this and I'll make it work that's where
[1:43:23.040 --> 1:43:29.040]  the combination of those those things plus the opportunity to to shake hands and change money
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:35.200]  that's how we make business and so often these these are separate things to many times we end up
[1:43:35.200 --> 1:43:42.160]  in a situation where we buy a product not exactly what we want but but then but then you ask yourself
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:46.320]  but that product can evolve and get better because it's getting information from the from the
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:51.520]  buyer about what's wrong with it and then and then you know they get pricing signals you know
[1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:58.080]  sounds very very very very much like a buzzword but the idea is simply that look I can't charge
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:05.040]  much for this thing like today I can't charge $400 for for office anymore and that's a signal to
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:10.640]  Microsoft to say go do something else and and if you don't have that signal you just keep doing it
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:16.560]  so so if you sell to enterprises who are like well whatever I'll keep paying then then you
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:22.240]  you you you you get dumber you get dumbering not not not move on as if you have consumer as a
[1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:26.640]  customer then they're gonna eventually say oh I'm not gonna pay that anymore I'm gonna go off
[1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:32.240]  and buy a tablet that does good enough work instead of a PC etc etc and so and so that this is
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:37.120]  that this is why the conversation happens with the customer so anyway there's a lot of these things
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:42.800]  we can we can talk about but bottom line is that and when I think about an Uber I always think about
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:46.560]  well why are they really hired to do and I think what they're hired to do is saying I want to
[1:44:46.560 --> 1:44:55.760]  car outside my door whenever I'm ready to go and and if I have that that option every time
[1:44:55.760 --> 1:45:01.760]  every day everywhere then I don't need a car anymore and that means I can get rid of my car
[1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:06.800]  and if if I can do a deal with Uber and say hey guys I don't want to pay it pay for this trip every
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:11.200]  every time I get in the car but can I just pay up front $300 and you guys always show up
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:17.760]  and Uber works it out and says okay you know they probably will have some customers that will
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:22.720]  use it less and some customers that will use it more but on average maybe $300 a month is a good price
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:31.280]  to offer it as a as a all you can eat Uber then suddenly that you know you'll have like Amazon
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:38.560]  Amazon Prime and so you you'll be saying you know I want Uber Prime so Uber Prime is a $350 a month
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:42.560]  maybe in the beginning they're gonna charge $500 a month because some people will pay that and
[1:45:42.560 --> 1:45:49.600]  probably they'll have fewer fewer sparse users etc etc so over time that's going to change but
[1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:54.080]  anyway they'll do that in some day you know and then what and then so Uber is putting in
[1:45:54.080 --> 1:45:58.640]  pulling out all this money $500 and they're saying and then they have to turn around and hire
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:05.840]  people to to serve as surefurs or whatever and and they'll say you know maybe we we ought to
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:12.640]  finance their car buying maybe we ought to put them on the payroll maybe we're gonna get some
[1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:17.440]  autonomous vehicles would have their algorithms for dispatch because we'll know where these people
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:22.640]  live etc etc etc so a lot of these things are going to be information driven and at that point
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.680]  though the you know the the machine just takes over and it just goes goes and goes rolling and rolling
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:32.640]  and and as far as the entrepreneurs concern at every stage of that journey they're just following
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:37.680]  in their instincts they're saying well obviously we're gonna do this right people are asking for it
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:42.960]  or hey I just some guy you know intern runs in the room and say hey what we thought I'm doing
[1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:47.520]  this this makes a lot of sense I just ran these numbers look at this and so they'll do it without
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:53.120]  any kind of great strategy or any kind of big vision or any McKinsey consultant telling them
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:58.720]  that's what the future is going to be so they'll do it intuitively and and lo and behold 10 years
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:06.000]  later they'll they'll they'll have uh millions of customers paying them billions of dollars a year
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.160]  to provide in their transportation services and all those millions of customers will have
[1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:16.400]  abandoned owning a car and Uber will be commissioning more Prius's than anybody else on the planet
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:22.240]  probably you know enough to fill a factory uh with production so if they in that case why should
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:27.200]  Uber just make its own cars and maybe will maybe it won't maybe it'll just simply do a great deal
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:34.400]  with Luc Toyota and and Toyota will essentially be having one giant customer uh or you know versus
[1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.520]  millions of small ones and uh and so maybe that deal will work for the both of them but maybe not
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:44.000]  maybe the you know Uber Uber will say you know Prius isn't the best configuration we can do a lot
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  better if we if we've made our own design and then they'll hire the best designer out of GM or Toyota
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:55.360]  or BMW and they'll say we'd go to it and by the way we got manufacturing uh guys can help as well
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:01.360]  and on it goes right so this is why you go from a baby to a mature adult that suddenly is
[1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:05.520]  but that's the thing that's occurred to me and I realized that it's very different if you live
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:10.480]  in a relatively or or like I live in a real urban environment I've in center city Philadelphia
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:15.040]  uh I go to New York a lot I go to San Francisco a lot but if you live anywhere it's even relatively
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:19.360]  Uber where Uber can be a practical service I mean obviously there's in especially in the United
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:23.680]  States there's many people who live in rural areas where Uber isn't gonna make sense or at
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:29.840]  least isn't gonna make sense for a long time um but it just take a look at a typical city where
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:36.560]  are most of the cars by far and away most of the cars at any moment in any city are parked right
[1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:42.480]  which is incredibly inefficient and it's an enormous part of the pain in the ass of owning a car
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:51.040]  or even visiting a city with a car is the pain of parking uh yep so I but I can but that's actually
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:57.280]  good for the auto industry where there's a lot more cars being sold than there are cars being
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:03.840]  driven at any moment and the disruption of Uber is let's keep these cars moving and it's almost
[1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:09.680]  like the airline uh metaphor you know and you hear that like one of the reasons that southwest is
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:14.480]  is more successful than most other airlines is that the employees buy into the mantra
[1:49:15.040 --> 1:49:19.680]  um you can't make money with planes that aren't in the air and that's why they they're
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:29.040]  southwest has you know significantly uh like like it contributes to their profitability that they
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:35.680]  their take that takes them less time to disembark and embark on a flight and they keep most of
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:40.160]  their planes in the air well an Uber car that isn't being driven isn't making money
[1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:45.280]  and but that if people stop buying cars and just leaving them in their garage parked all night
[1:49:46.640 --> 1:49:51.360]  I don't know that could to me be terribly disruptive to the auto industry in terms of the number of
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:59.520]  cars being bought oh yes oh yes indeed and that's see the dream that you have of better utilization
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:07.120]  of cars is exactly also Google's dream when it came to uh you know to to their motivation for
[1:50:07.120 --> 1:50:11.520]  driverless cars because they they but the here's the interesting thing this is where the theory
[1:50:11.520 --> 1:50:17.840]  comes into play again is that let's say uh you follow the logic of Google and their their
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:23.600]  algorithm make approach to to autonomy and then you follow Uber's logic and you ask here's a good
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:31.040]  question let's say you see both of them pointing in the direction of of uh the the uh you know
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:37.680]  sort of depopulating cities with with automobiles and and and increasing its utilization of automobiles
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:43.360]  and so who wins because this is where the where you have to have another way of thinking
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:49.680]  and theorizing about it because the problem I think is that in the case of Google they're just saying
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:56.960]  we understand where we were going we're gonna get there through a process of of of research and
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:03.440]  we're gonna we're gonna ship uh the product when it's ready and that's where where I think that's
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:07.440]  kind of a deliberate approach where it's Uber is just gonna fall its nose and go down that path
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:11.360]  and maybe it'll get there maybe it won't but all the time it does it it learns and all the time
[1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:16.560]  it does it it gets profitable and so if that's that it might my bed would be that Uber will get there
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:21.280]  faster so that's that's that's how I would I would analyze that but it's it's a great story it's a
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:28.560]  wonderful um do you think here's my question about Uber is how does Uber protect their lead?
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:34.720]  What keeps other companies from saying oh I see what they're doing let's all do that too
[1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:40.880]  and then all of a sudden the the whole idea of anything you could use Uber for is commoditized
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:48.640]  some of it is just plain uh just plain uh running as fast as you can so one thing obviously is that
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:54.400]  they're they're they're recruiting drivers as quickly as possible they're they're recruiting
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:00.400]  users as quickly as possible establishing as many cities as possible so they're running essentially
[1:52:00.400 --> 1:52:07.520]  in the land grab scenario where you identify the resources that you need drivers cars uh passengers
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:13.920]  and and regulation and you just like sweeping the land with that um and then you you assume there's
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:17.840]  a first move advantage of course how this can come in but you realize it's heavy lifting
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:23.360]  similarly you could have said well why you know when Google stumbled upon search as the answer
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:26.640]  why didn't everybody else I mean yes their algorithms were better but there were other search
[1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:32.080]  engines and partly was like Google doubled and tripled and quadrupled down on on servers and on
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:37.200]  infrastructure and that was basically that was their that was their secret sauce it was brute force
[1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:41.280]  it was just running really fast and so in the early years that's what they were obsessed
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:47.120]  uh and and excessively focused on response times like like to a degree like where other search
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:52.880]  engines were measuring response times in seconds and Google was already measuring intensive a second
[1:52:53.520 --> 1:53:00.000]  and and right and so experience was important and but ultimately it was like they did the heavy
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  you know they designed their own data centers they designed their own servers at a time when all
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:09.520]  those things you could buy on even even rent uh and and so why do they need to go so deep in
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:13.840]  the guts of their of their operations because they realized that the thing that they needed to tweak
[1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:19.680]  the most was that performance metric and the scaling metric and so that let them essentially run
[1:53:19.680 --> 1:53:24.800]  like wildfire and capture share and again same thing with Microsoft by the way and others who came
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:30.080]  before it's this this driving driving force that you're just going to go as fast as you can because
[1:53:30.080 --> 1:53:34.400]  you know you know where you're going you know you know what what you're doing and the other guys are
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:39.680]  just not sure if that's worth committing how many billions you know and especially the big guys
[1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:45.680]  they're like I don't get this yeah I had the thought I had about it was sort of the way that as long as
[1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:53.600]  they as law you know the the first mover advantage is is real but you have to kind of stay focused
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:59.440]  on still being the best even if it's in small ways and the thing that made me think about it was a
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:06.880]  tweet from a friend the guy who stole my shirt Ben Thompson this week where he he mentioned that
[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:15.280]  he was in San Francisco obviously for WWDC2 and had a couple of coupons or codes or something to get
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:21.520]  free rides in lift and he had been meaning to try it he'd never tried the service and here he'd
[1:54:21.520 --> 1:54:26.960]  gone back home to Taipei and have forgotten to use them and had taken in uber every time he got
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:32.240]  in a car in San Francisco simply out of habit and that the habits matter that without even thinking
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:36.000]  about it he'd forgotten to try lift even though he was going to be able to try it for free
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:44.000]  and to me that just speaks to the power of the first mover advantage yeah power of first mover
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:50.320]  power defaults power of of being the go-to thing that people hire right away and so there is
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:57.280]  something but that's again that's earned it's not something that that you can get to before you
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:04.000]  actually do great work it has it comes as a as as a byproduct of building the brand and building
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:08.400]  their experience and all those other things so you're knowing to focus on the right thing at the
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:14.000]  right time knowing to put all the chips on the table when you know you have a good hand that's
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:19.120]  really at first of course you got to get the chips but that's the thing is that the magic of the
[1:55:19.120 --> 1:55:24.560]  entrepreneur is the one that is that is able to to parlay every advantage into another one and
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:30.240]  then it but bet again and again and again doubling down every time and shifting their strategy
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:36.240]  all along the way and pivoting as they call it these days that's that's the magic of it I
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:41.520]  could not agree more so let's wrap it up we're near in the two hour mark horror said you thank
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:46.400]  you extraordinarily for your time what a fascinating conversation here's where people people can
