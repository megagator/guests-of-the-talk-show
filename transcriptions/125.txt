[00:00.000 --> 00:07.340]  Ah Horace did you welcome I think this is definitely the first time right unless I'm misremembered. Yeah, definitely, you know
[00:08.740 --> 00:10.740]  Now that you had you know
[00:12.180 --> 00:18.600]  Not that yet Phil on I guess it's you know, you're legitimate it's worth doing
[00:19.680 --> 00:21.960]  You know, there was something I was supposed to say last week
[00:21.960 --> 00:27.500]  I should have and I forgot it's a little bit of follow-up from that live episode of the show with with
[00:27.500 --> 00:32.800]  The Phil Schiller. So at the end of the live episode right towards the end as I thanked him
[00:32.800 --> 00:39.760]  I thanked everybody and then I asked the audience if the live video stream had stayed up because we we had tried something new
[00:40.800 --> 00:45.440]  We actually had that set up before I knew that that Phil Schiller was gonna be the guest
[00:45.440 --> 00:48.160]  We were gonna try to live stream it anyway, so I asked the audience
[00:48.160 --> 00:48.560]  Hey
[00:48.560 --> 00:54.040]  Did the live stream stay up because my thought was hey once word gets out on Twitter that Phil Schiller is on the show
[00:54.040 --> 00:59.280]  it might you know overwhelm it and some knucklehead down in front yelled no and
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.320]  And then Phil Phil made a very funny joke. He said hey these things are hard
[01:05.600 --> 01:11.280]  But I felt bad. I thought the live stream is down and then as soon as we got offstage my phone started going off and
[01:12.380 --> 01:16.560]  People were texting me and they were like I'm watching right now live on the video stream
[01:16.560 --> 01:19.360]  I'm watching right now live on the video stream did not go down
[01:19.360 --> 01:25.080]  so I don't know who the knucklehead is in the audience who said that the live stream went down and maybe there were
[01:25.880 --> 01:27.880]  problems for a few people here and there but
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.200]  It apparently did not go down and there were an awful lot of people who did watch it live on the stream
[01:33.200 --> 01:35.040]  And I wanted so the reason I want to call that out though
[01:35.040 --> 01:39.000]  is that the company that did it is a company called hybrid events group and
[01:39.800 --> 01:41.800]  I'll put a link to their
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.840]  their Twitter in the show notes
[01:44.480 --> 01:47.280]  Their their Twitter is at hybrid events
[01:47.280 --> 01:53.240]  GRP because I guess they ran up against the the limit and Twitter usernames
[01:53.240 --> 01:55.560]  But anyway, they did a great job couldn't be happier with them
[01:55.560 --> 02:01.560]  And I feel terrible that at the end of this live stream that they work their asses off to keep up and do a good
[02:01.560 --> 02:02.560]  job on
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.280]  It looked like it did not stay up and it went down but it didn't so
[02:07.280 --> 02:08.760]  Well, you know
[02:08.760 --> 02:14.840]  You know if you have knuckleheads, I mean that the thing is there's always someone you know, who's not happy. So
[02:14.840 --> 02:21.160]  There's always an Apple people are just as likely maybe more so to complain, right? So
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.280]  Yeah, I guess so
[02:23.280 --> 02:28.640]  I just don't know what would have driven somebody to shout out know that the stream didn't stay up when in fact it did and
[02:28.640 --> 02:33.400]  And if there were any problems they were minor and sporadic. Yeah, but anyway, it was a lot of fun
[02:35.480 --> 02:38.280]  So you were out at WWDC I
[02:38.960 --> 02:42.400]  was I was there and I was I was sitting I
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.040]  I was I was actually fortunate to sit pretty in a pretty good spot
[02:47.040 --> 02:49.240]  I would actually they they managed I came in late
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.280]  I had gone to the bathroom because they always tell you go to the bathroom, you know, because he could run long and
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.760]  And by the time I came back out, you know, they had let him everybody in
[02:57.760 --> 03:00.400]  so I was like almost the last person to get in and I'm like
[03:00.960 --> 03:05.160]  wandering around near the front trying to find a place because sometimes people
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.860]  people in the front don't fill up completely and and and I was actually
[03:10.860 --> 03:12.300]  kindly
[03:12.300 --> 03:14.300]  taken by hand
[03:14.820 --> 03:18.600]  By an Apple person and sat next to actually sat behind
[03:19.660 --> 03:22.300]  Ben Baharan and and his father
[03:23.220 --> 03:27.020]  and and so I had I was like the fifth row and
[03:27.540 --> 03:33.220]  And it was it was really the best seat I ever had and for now that that's what I got for being late
[03:33.220 --> 03:36.580]  You know, so it was it was for me. It was a thrill to be
[03:36.580 --> 03:42.580]  To be in that in that great spot and and you know in previous shows. I remember sitting behind you
[03:43.780 --> 03:46.780]  that was funny sandwich behind between you and
[03:47.980 --> 03:50.480]  Like Renee, for example, you know
[03:51.100 --> 03:57.380]  So there's always these great people you meet there and that's almost more exciting than then the show itself
[03:57.380 --> 03:59.380]  You know just getting to meet these people
[03:59.620 --> 04:02.260]  Yeah, I have been to enough of these now
[04:02.260 --> 04:07.620]  it's funny because it's like it's dawned on me that now I'm I'm like in I've been to enough of these keynotes where I'm sort
[04:07.620 --> 04:09.620]  of a veteran rather than a
[04:10.020 --> 04:11.860]  Rookie and I but I still think of myself
[04:11.860 --> 04:14.180]  I still think every time I go to one of these things like wow
[04:14.180 --> 04:20.000]  I can't believe that I'm invited to attend one of these Apple keynotes. I know it's a it's a little bit thrilling every time
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  I've probably been three or four and
[04:22.220 --> 04:29.720]  It's it's still you feel the little bit of a tingle every time and it's kind of feel privileged to be there
[04:29.720 --> 04:37.040]  And I've had the same experience though where sometimes if you want a good seat, it's actually advantageous to not
[04:37.600 --> 04:40.960]  Wander in with friends or colleagues or you know
[04:40.960 --> 04:44.640]  Because what happens is you mingle before they open the doors and you see people who you know
[04:44.640 --> 04:50.320]  Like remember I think it was you who took the picture of me and Ben Thompson wearing seemingly identical shirts this year
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.600]  Seemingly, I thought they were identical
[04:52.640 --> 04:57.240]  There was they were in fact different brands, but it would be very hard for any but I think you'd have to like
[04:57.240 --> 05:02.840]  Look at the label to see the difference. So Ben Thompson and I showed up at the keynote dressed like twins and
[05:03.800 --> 05:06.800]  You were kind enough to document that for posterity
[05:06.800 --> 05:11.080]  But anyway, you've run into people who you know like that and then you go in the keynote together
[05:11.080 --> 05:16.280]  But then if it's like a group of five or six of you you look for five or six seats and it limits where you
[05:16.280 --> 05:22.680]  Go sometimes going in just by yourself or going to like you like you go into the restroom one time
[05:22.680 --> 05:24.720]  I think it was last year for WWDC it
[05:24.720 --> 05:28.560]  At the keynote it used to be for years and years
[05:28.560 --> 05:33.040]  There's always been a 10 10 o'clock start and it used to be that they let press in
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.960]  Very close to the end
[05:34.960 --> 05:40.680]  I mean sometimes to the point where people would start like getting nervous and be like are they forgotten us?
[05:40.680 --> 05:41.760]  Are they gonna start without us?
[05:41.760 --> 05:46.760]  Like there was one year where we you know, the members of the media didn't get in until I don't know five or ten minutes
[05:46.760 --> 05:48.760]  before ten o'clock
[05:48.760 --> 05:55.480]  But it's part of the new Apple with Tim Cook is that stuff runs a lot more regularly and stuff
[05:55.880 --> 06:02.200]  Starts exactly on time. I mean if you've noticed with Tim Cook the keynote start at ten. Oh, oh, oh, oh, I mean
[06:02.720 --> 06:08.500]  To the second but you know, I noticed a couple of the details and maybe you already went over this with your audience
[06:08.500 --> 06:12.880]  but I a couple of details one they when they let the the press in they
[06:13.400 --> 06:18.360]  They segregate the photographers from everybody else. Oh, no, they've always done that. Yeah
[06:18.360 --> 06:20.560]  They've always done that but the purpose is that you know
[06:20.560 --> 06:27.160]  They've got their own little they've got their own little bleachers or whatever wing and then the other thing that's interesting
[06:27.160 --> 06:34.200]  Is that then there's kind of like this time when the executives who usually sit in the middle section and the front middle?
[06:34.600 --> 06:36.600]  so the executives begin to cut
[06:36.600 --> 06:42.720]  you know come in and take their seats and they're basically they're mingling a little bit with each other and
[06:42.720 --> 06:49.560]  it's like you see the camera guys just going nuts taking all these shots of the executives mingling and I
[06:49.840 --> 06:56.200]  Wonder how much of that is planned so that they have this photo op for for this kind of casual
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.200]  Interaction that happens with with with some of the the superstars of Apple if you will
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.240]  You know, you see people would just like in the audience stand up and and you yeah
[07:09.240 --> 07:16.400]  Hey, I see I see Johnny, you know, or I I see Angela or I see so-and-so and it was funny to see how I you
[07:16.400 --> 07:17.800]  know, it seems
[07:17.800 --> 07:22.720]  so natural, but I wonder how much of it is actually on purpose done that way to
[07:23.400 --> 07:30.840]  Create the opportunity for the photographers to take their shots and have something. I don't know. That's my take. Uh, it's definitely strategic
[07:30.840 --> 07:36.520]  I'm not quite sure what the strategy is though and about which sight lines they're looking to give the photographers
[07:36.520 --> 07:40.640]  It seems to me like what they want is they want the photographers not close
[07:41.360 --> 07:45.760]  But and so if you are if you're serious about taking the photography at the event
[07:45.760 --> 07:51.080]  You really want to bring a long lens and assume that you know, you're gonna be zoomed in from a distance
[07:51.920 --> 07:53.920]  And that you're not gonna get close
[07:54.360 --> 07:57.280]  but anyway last year I I think it was last year I
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.780]  you know was
[07:59.780 --> 08:01.880]  walking to the
[08:01.880 --> 08:08.440]  To the Moscone from my hotel and it was around 930. So it was about half hour before but I got a text from a
[08:08.440 --> 08:12.960]  Couple people that hey, they've already let us in and I was like, oh crap. So I was like you were this year
[08:12.960 --> 08:16.800]  I was like one of the last ones in and had a similar type thing where I wound up
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.800]  You know somebody from Apple PR spotted me looking for a seat and was like here come on up here and I said
[08:20.800 --> 08:22.480]  I don't know fifth or sixth row or something
[08:22.480 --> 08:27.640]  but it's weird sitting up there because when you're up there with all the Apple employees, they're the people who sort of
[08:27.640 --> 08:33.680]  Applaud at strategic points and sort of try to get the applause rolling at applause points
[08:33.880 --> 08:38.280]  Which you know, it's to me as a member of the media is not really appropriate
[08:38.280 --> 08:42.600]  It feels a little bit like you're sitting in the home team crowd when you're up there, really
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.560]  I know I didn't sense that but I did sense in other events that they were some cheerleading going on
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.100]  but I didn't see here this one, but in the it is
[08:51.100 --> 08:59.340]  It's it's kind of a bit interesting experience I guess it's we're very privileged that we have that access to
[08:59.740 --> 09:06.660]  to the event the way we do and and and to each other and it's wonderful and in fact, that's where I I
[09:07.660 --> 09:13.580]  Asked you I said hey, how about we get together and do this, right? So yeah. Yeah, that was exactly where this got set up
[09:15.420 --> 09:18.940]  So now we're a couple weeks out and I feel like and when we're about to enter
[09:18.940 --> 09:24.180]  What's more or less the summer doldrums news wise I don't think we're gonna get you know
[09:24.180 --> 09:27.700]  Other than the launch that this the imminent launch of Apple music
[09:28.760 --> 09:32.460]  There's not much going on and you know never really is in July or August
[09:34.100 --> 09:40.440]  So, I'm just curious what you think overall with a couple of weeks behind us what you think in hindsight of you know
[09:40.440 --> 09:42.440]  the WWDC keynote
[09:42.440 --> 09:48.440]  Well, so the the you know, it's I'm not a good analyst of
[09:49.200 --> 09:52.480]  Events that way because I tend to look for
[09:53.320 --> 09:55.640]  the under the under
[09:56.900 --> 10:04.920]  The understated and the the is there is there a deeper thing and I don't dwell on the feature set so much
[10:04.920 --> 10:10.040]  I'm not making a list of the big ideas. I'm trying to find where the small ideas and
[10:10.040 --> 10:11.920]  the
[10:11.920 --> 10:17.360]  to me the the big thing this whole year has been
[10:18.160 --> 10:23.440]  around what I call humanism of Apple the idea that Apple is
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.820]  presenting a new face a new
[10:28.680 --> 10:30.440]  definition of its
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.960]  of its principal operating strategy, which is really about
[10:34.960 --> 10:42.560]  Not the algorithm. It's hard to put a word on it because the the the the the dominant
[10:43.640 --> 10:51.240]  logic of Silicon Valley is that that power of the algorithm is power of the of the of
[10:52.320 --> 10:56.120]  business and and and all that flows from it and
[10:56.120 --> 11:04.240]  And and somehow what I see is this shift where Apple's saying, you know, we don't necessarily believe in the power of the algorithm. In
[11:04.920 --> 11:13.120]  fact, we may actually believe in the anti algorithm and the anti algorithm is the human being and the word I came up with is
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.000]  humanism other humanism is a word that was used to
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.420]  counter the notion of a world based around faith and so so this was a sort of a
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.220]  Maybe I got the timing wrong
[11:26.220 --> 11:28.220]  but maybe a Renaissance or a
[11:28.580 --> 11:35.540]  period of time when when people began looking at the at humans at the center of the universe or the center of thought and
[11:35.940 --> 11:37.820]  and that
[11:37.820 --> 11:44.100]  That idea of putting man in the center was was big deal back then because the church was it was the dominant leader
[11:44.100 --> 11:49.260]  And and so my way of thinking is that I'm not trying to position against faith
[11:49.260 --> 11:55.700]  but rather position against the notion of the the all-powerful algorithm as as the
[11:56.620 --> 12:01.200]  Counterparty to this to this idea. And so what's the evidence the evidence is number one?
[12:01.940 --> 12:05.420]  That they believe in curation they believe in
[12:06.420 --> 12:11.620]  Actual people making decisions when we've seen this already for years and years on the App Store
[12:12.140 --> 12:16.980]  That there would be someone making it now. So that means they're fallible. That means they're gonna make mistakes
[12:16.980 --> 12:21.140]  That means they're gonna make all you know upset people and offend people
[12:21.660 --> 12:27.480]  But with it comes also the benefit of judgment that comes from a from from the mind of an individual
[12:27.980 --> 12:34.620]  Second piece of evidence Johnny I've in all his in all his visions of what people want
[12:35.060 --> 12:41.740]  He's making a judgment. He's making a call. He's calling the he's curating essentially
[12:42.220 --> 12:44.140]  What it is that we want
[12:44.140 --> 12:50.020]  And rather than than offering every possible option, they'll tell you no, these are the best options
[12:50.020 --> 12:56.220]  We believe that so these are old stories the news stories. I think bring it even more to the surface are
[12:56.900 --> 12:59.260]  Well, we're actually going to decide how to surface
[13:00.220 --> 13:04.100]  The music that people should listen to or we're gonna surface
[13:05.220 --> 13:06.980]  the
[13:06.980 --> 13:09.180]  generally speaking media and so
[13:09.180 --> 13:14.300]  trust us with with our judgment with our taste and
[13:14.980 --> 13:21.060]  That idea is so opposite to the algorithmic ideas that exist
[13:21.700 --> 13:27.680]  As the norm that I feel like somehow this is the beginning and also by the way the idea that trust us
[13:27.900 --> 13:31.020]  comes down to privacy trust us comes down to
[13:31.900 --> 13:33.820]  to
[13:33.820 --> 13:40.260]  being able to put together the the integrated package that we think are the features that you really need and
[13:40.540 --> 13:45.140]  Know more than that. And so this whole idea has been around sort of latent
[13:45.300 --> 13:50.180]  But suddenly it's springing up and going head to head with algorithm based
[13:51.220 --> 13:58.580]  Business models. I think that's a great observation and that's exactly the sort of insight that I honestly I'm looking for you from from the keynote
[13:58.580 --> 14:04.100]  Like whereas it's not about point-by-point critiquing the the performances on stage
[14:04.100 --> 14:09.700]  but rather trying to suss out what the actual meaning was because I and I think you'll agree with me here that I
[14:11.140 --> 14:14.420]  Think one of the more interesting things of today's Apple
[14:14.420 --> 14:17.580]  Let's call it Tim Cook's Apple because I think that's roughly, you know
[14:17.580 --> 14:24.500]  I think it does correspond roughly to when he took over as CEO and I think it's it's deliberate and I think it is his
[14:24.940 --> 14:26.940]  personality coming to the surface I
[14:26.940 --> 14:28.940]  think Apple
[14:28.980 --> 14:33.140]  Wants to be better understood by people outside the company
[14:33.700 --> 14:37.540]  Whereas before I don't think it was so much that they they wanted to be misunderstood
[14:37.540 --> 14:39.660]  But that they just didn't care if you didn't get it
[14:39.660 --> 14:45.860]  They they want they reveled in the in the mystique of Apple. I think the mystique of Apple was
[14:46.740 --> 14:48.740]  There's value in being mysterious
[14:49.220 --> 14:51.220]  There's value in being
[14:51.380 --> 14:55.880]  misunderstood even because at some point you're gonna get the aha moment that you were wrong and then
[14:55.880 --> 15:03.120]  Those who become aware of it through their own discovery own that fact even more deeply and I think you're right
[15:03.120 --> 15:05.520]  that is the the sort of the jobs Ian ethos of
[15:06.320 --> 15:08.000]  public relations
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.600]  preserve a
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.920]  Distance and you're right. I think there's the sensitivity more towards well, you know
[15:14.920 --> 15:17.640]  Maybe we don't need to be so mysterious after all
[15:18.640 --> 15:21.560]  But but here's where I feel that there's still
[15:21.560 --> 15:26.860]  the mystique which is that they speak actually plainly of what their
[15:27.160 --> 15:31.720]  Intentions are and when you see this in Tim Cook's statements like
[15:32.760 --> 15:34.760]  The product is our North Star
[15:35.480 --> 15:43.320]  That we are concerned about doing good work rather than being profitable or having a rate of return
[15:44.380 --> 15:48.120]  When he sometimes is very pointedly attacks some some Wall Street
[15:48.120 --> 15:50.120]  Punditry
[15:50.280 --> 15:57.800]  Other times, you know, you see this this language from from Johnny I've about does a product deserve to exist and
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.660]  We you know, and and so we you see these framed very carefully
[16:03.200 --> 16:09.440]  Articulated statements which which I would say ninety nine point nine percent of listeners throw away
[16:09.800 --> 16:16.320]  as you know in one ear and out the other and it's just as if like these guys are just using some kind of
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.120]  Some kind of poetry to bamboozle us
[16:20.240 --> 16:26.080]  but what I my I think perhaps my favorite thing to do in Apple analysis is
[16:26.600 --> 16:30.280]  Take literal word out of the horse's mouth
[16:30.720 --> 16:35.920]  analysis of the framing of the phrases every little detail when they say something and
[16:36.880 --> 16:41.920]  Deconstructing it and saying, you know, there's a code in here. There's there's there's actually meaningful
[16:41.920 --> 16:46.120]  Communication going on. So my take on it is yes. There is a
[16:46.640 --> 16:48.160]  more
[16:48.160 --> 16:50.480]  There's more articulation using using
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.380]  Coding coded phrases and this is you it's Steve Jobs didn't need to he would speak
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.080]  From the heart and so what he what came out of his mouth was was deconstructed
[17:01.080 --> 17:05.520]  But but he was the was the spokesperson and now we have simply a lot of other spokespeople
[17:05.840 --> 17:10.600]  who are doing these types of very interesting phrasings and and I take them and I
[17:10.600 --> 17:16.360]  I see from that to me that is what guides my thinking that guides my analysis
[17:16.840 --> 17:18.840]  rather than saying
[17:19.120 --> 17:24.960]  The you know what the numbers say and what the profit logic might be I always ask
[17:26.720 --> 17:32.040]  Given their language how what are they going to do next? So to give you the example of like, you know
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.920]  People were asking a few months ago. What about the car? What about the car? And I said well
[17:35.920 --> 17:42.360]  Here's how I would work that out and I would say what the Johnny I've saved about about product with this Tim Cook say about product
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.280]  Therefore the product that has to emerge has to comply to these rules. They have to have a meaningful contribution. They it has to be
[17:51.160 --> 17:53.160]  It has to be
[17:54.480 --> 17:58.400]  Better in ways that are that in which Apple can contribute etc
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.400]  And so I what I would do is simply take those verbatim
[18:01.400 --> 18:08.080]  Comic, you know communication from Apple and and use those as my lenses to analyze the questions at hand
[18:08.280 --> 18:10.400]  so in that sense, that's how
[18:10.920 --> 18:12.840]  That's how Apple is is
[18:12.840 --> 18:17.480]  Different in my way in my way of thinking because if you did that with that with with Steve Jobs comments
[18:17.480 --> 18:21.400]  He was flip-flopping on a lot of them were simply like today. I feel this way
[18:21.920 --> 18:28.040]  And and they couldn't really rely on those statements as guiding guiding principles and I think Apple remember once
[18:28.040 --> 18:31.880]  It might it reminds me what Tim Cook was acting CEO
[18:32.920 --> 18:38.380]  He went on a conference call and he almost like stated a poem in a poetic way
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.400]  What we believe in and it was like one of these like
[18:43.060 --> 18:46.400]  Speeches buried in the in a conference call with analysts
[18:46.400 --> 18:46.880]  Yeah
[18:46.880 --> 18:52.160]  that usually introduce it and I wrote it up and I said I called it the Tim Cook doctrine and
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.320]  This was before he was full-time CEO or I should say permanent CEO and he he you know
[18:57.320 --> 19:02.180]  I wrote those down and I I broke the lines up in the way that I almost looked like a poem and I said
[19:02.320 --> 19:09.480]  You know, there it is. There's the there's the there's an algorithm right there about how this business works. We're going to cross-pollinate
[19:09.480 --> 19:11.480]  I remember he used that phrase
[19:12.680 --> 19:17.120]  You know, I don't remember a lot of it but it's I can go back and dig it up
[19:17.120 --> 19:20.920]  It's it's the doctrine and it's still in searchable in the blog
[19:20.920 --> 19:26.040]  So anyway, that's the kind of guy he is I think and that's been that was way back in what?
[19:26.040 --> 19:27.840]  2000
[19:27.840 --> 19:29.840]  probably eight or nine
[19:30.120 --> 19:37.340]  So it's it's it's very much a reflection of what what you think of as Tim Cook's Apple. Yeah
[19:38.080 --> 19:43.460]  and so you I I think part of went wrong in that keynote was the way that
[19:43.840 --> 19:45.660]  And I don't know if you thought this too
[19:45.660 --> 19:51.800]  I know most people who I've spoken to agree that the music segment at the end was was too long and disorganized
[19:51.800 --> 19:56.340]  but in hindsight as we get closer to the launch of of Apple music and
[19:57.380 --> 20:05.060]  I read more and more about it. I see that as the picture becomes more clear to me. It was there. It just wasn't
[20:06.060 --> 20:11.780]  The information was there what I what I think we should understand about it was there but it it it was too
[20:12.140 --> 20:18.580]  disorganized for it to be clear and so part of it is what you said about the humanism and not trusting in the algorithm and
[20:18.580 --> 20:24.460]  It's and I know it was there and I know that that they mentioned it a few times with the beats one radio
[20:25.500 --> 20:27.500]  How it's going to be
[20:28.620 --> 20:33.060]  You know human selected, you know, there's yeah, it curated perfect word
[20:33.060 --> 20:40.420]  But there was a New York Times profile today or yesterday earlier this week of Zane Lowe who's coming from BBC one in the UK
[20:41.660 --> 20:43.660]  super highly regarded
[20:44.080 --> 20:45.500]  DJ
[20:45.500 --> 20:51.940]  And I know at this was mentioned in the keynote, but it just kind of I lost it because I was just losing focus
[20:51.940 --> 20:57.640]  but it they mentioned that it their intention with this is not so much that you're going to
[20:58.100 --> 21:01.380]  Pick your favorite genre and go go to station
[21:01.380 --> 21:04.860]  It's sort of like the anti XM radio like we've got XM radio in our car
[21:04.860 --> 21:11.240]  And I think there's like two 200 stations or 300 stations. I don't know it's an unbelievable number, but you can dial in to
[21:11.240 --> 21:17.240]  I mean they have an entire station that's just Frank Sinatra and there's like a station just for Elvis Presley
[21:18.280 --> 21:20.560]  With this beats one their intention
[21:20.560 --> 21:24.680]  I mean, obviously you're gonna be able to stream music based on your preference if that's what you want
[21:24.680 --> 21:26.680]  but if you listen to beats one, it's
[21:26.840 --> 21:29.380]  Any new music that they think is interesting?
[21:30.540 --> 21:36.220]  Which is to me a really interesting way to go and it is absolutely not algorithmically generated
[21:36.220 --> 21:42.740]  Absolutely, and that's exactly the thinking that I think this new Apple is about and I think with Johnny. Sorry
[21:43.300 --> 21:50.580]  Jimmy Iovine was the one who probably sold him on the idea that we you can do this to music and let me let
[21:50.660 --> 21:53.420]  Guess here. I'm no no no no evidence
[21:53.420 --> 21:59.060]  but let me guess that he probably remembered back in the days when there were influential DJs in the United States who
[21:59.660 --> 22:01.140]  pretty much
[22:01.140 --> 22:03.780]  drove musical taste who could
[22:03.780 --> 22:05.780]  You know who could?
[22:07.100 --> 22:14.300]  Influence a generation by selecting the right music and then playing it and you know over time that became corrupted by
[22:14.580 --> 22:21.380]  by scandalous type of you know bribing and bribing and so on but but the job of me of the radio was for the
[22:23.140 --> 22:25.060]  Generation to discover
[22:25.060 --> 22:28.420]  the music that that that spoke for them and
[22:28.420 --> 22:35.880]  What what what we're seeing now with the with an abundance and an overabundance of choice is that?
[22:36.920 --> 22:42.540]  There isn't that you assume. Here's the assumption I think of the end of the internet is that
[22:43.560 --> 22:48.000]  You can select it for yourself, and I think that's not the case for most people
[22:48.840 --> 22:52.640]  Secondly you can use your friends as a as a selection criteria
[22:52.640 --> 22:59.120]  Which is somewhat what Twitter does is you use a your your feed as a way to select what to read?
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.620]  And so there's that notion that you select good friends and your friends are gonna select good things for you
[23:05.240 --> 23:10.940]  But that has its pitfalls as well. What if you select the wrong friends and and and and finally
[23:10.940 --> 23:17.680]  There's the algorithm which is the idea that let's sample what you like, and then we'll give you will give you
[23:18.480 --> 23:20.480]  selections and all of these where
[23:20.480 --> 23:24.700]  Are are the the the modern version of discovery?
[23:25.560 --> 23:29.320]  What Apple is saying is let's go back to this idea that?
[23:30.320 --> 23:35.720]  No, it's an individual that we trust an individual who who has
[23:36.800 --> 23:44.440]  supreme ability of taste supreme ability at judgment about things and and that's again. This is this is a reflection of the
[23:45.160 --> 23:46.660]  logic of
[23:46.660 --> 23:52.040]  Johnny I've in the even the logic of Steve Steve Jobs, which said you know at the end of the day
[23:52.040 --> 23:53.520]  We're gonna decide
[23:53.520 --> 24:00.240]  What products are the ones we're gonna dedicate so much energy to and we're not gonna do a portfolio strategy
[24:00.240 --> 24:03.120]  We're not gonna hedge our bets, and we're not gonna do all these things we're gonna
[24:04.240 --> 24:06.800]  Hit a home run every time
[24:07.480 --> 24:12.760]  And by the way you know if I were to say well, that's that's crazy. It's only those two guys who can do it
[24:12.760 --> 24:17.460]  It's it's it's a it's it's not something that anybody else can do, but look at Hollywood look at the way
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.080]  Companies like Pixar are able to hit home runs every time because they have a brain trust
[24:23.480 --> 24:30.680]  Because they selected people who know how to make great stories and gave them the authority to say yes spent three four hundred million dollars
[24:31.040 --> 24:38.160]  on this project and three four years to get it done and yet they they do it every time and it you know we
[24:38.160 --> 24:45.200]  We we we we love them for it in contrast to a company that you know the old Disney
[24:45.200 --> 24:51.560]  Who just you know put out a portfolio and say essentially they're playing with a spreadsheet in order to decide
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.440]  What to make and that's that's a difference
[24:54.800 --> 25:01.040]  Instinct versus spreadsheets or the human versus the algorithm and and this is what surfaced
[25:01.040 --> 25:03.720]  I think through this through this event is how much more
[25:03.720 --> 25:10.840]  Music is gonna turn into that for as far as Apple's concerned and that is a very very different thing than what we've heard in
[25:10.840 --> 25:13.980]  The past from everyone else yeah Pixar is a good example, too
[25:13.980 --> 25:18.600]  Because I think that they've been so open about so much of their process
[25:18.920 --> 25:21.360]  It's not really a mystery according to them
[25:21.360 --> 25:27.560]  You know yeah, how they have been so successful and yet nobody else can bring themselves to do it and do it
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.280]  Yeah, it's like hiding in plain sight or here's the here's the formula
[25:31.280 --> 25:38.000]  But no one can no one has the courage to do that because it requires saying no to things which are nearly
[25:39.400 --> 25:44.180]  Proven to work you have to say that portfolio theory is the foundation of
[25:44.800 --> 25:48.720]  Finance and and and and who would their wildest mind
[25:48.800 --> 25:54.280]  It's like if I were an investor, and I would say forget about buying a basket of securities
[25:54.280 --> 25:56.640]  Just buy one company and own it all your life
[25:56.640 --> 26:01.600]  Yeah, that would be the strategy that Apple is suggesting they do as far as their investments
[26:01.600 --> 26:08.040]  Or that Pixar does in terms of their investments yeah that you have to have so much faith in that decision
[26:08.680 --> 26:10.800]  That you know you're throwing away
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.160]  The hedge opportunity right you're throwing away the the what if it doesn't go
[26:17.720 --> 26:21.000]  Right and and so so remember what Steve Jobs said
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.280]  Focus is about saying no and focus is is literally about saying no to everything else
[26:27.280 --> 26:32.600]  But the one thing and so if that's what's so hard and and here
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.560]  You know when we think about it that so this is very deep in the in the psyche of Apple in many ways
[26:37.560 --> 26:42.560]  But but when we're looking at it now through the through this question of products that they're launching as services
[26:42.760 --> 26:48.960]  They're essentially telling I think that you know you we asking you to trust us to act
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.840]  To make those choices for you when it comes to services and and things we're gonna give you
[26:55.280 --> 27:01.040]  And and and that means saying no to a lot of things and many people will just you know
[27:01.040 --> 27:08.640]  Huff and puff and say how dare you but but those who you know go ahead. You don't have to buy this isn't like you know
[27:09.840 --> 27:11.320]  You're not obligated
[27:11.320 --> 27:16.160]  but it's it's it's the way that I think that you're gonna appeal to the
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.720]  The type of audiences that are probably the the best audiences to have. Yeah. All right. Let me take a break
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.440]  I want to keep talking about music afterwards
[27:25.440 --> 27:32.440]  But let me take a break and thank the first of our three sponsors for the episode and it's our good friends
[27:32.440 --> 27:34.440]  I'm so happy to have him back. I love this company
[27:34.960 --> 27:39.160]  It's our good friends at back place. You guys remember back place
[27:40.200 --> 27:44.260]  online unlimited backup for your Mac
[27:44.260 --> 27:50.500]  What do you do you go to backblaze.com you download their software you install it on your Mac and
[27:51.060 --> 27:55.460]  You get 30 days free trial. It backs up everything on your Mac everything
[27:56.020 --> 27:58.820]  Just backs the whole thing up to the cloud their cloud-based server
[28:00.500 --> 28:01.940]  And
[28:01.940 --> 28:06.260]  after the 30 days you pay five bucks a month, that's it and
[28:07.300 --> 28:11.500]  It just backs up your whole everything you have an external hard drive in addition to your internal hard drive
[28:11.500 --> 28:14.340]  It backs that up to everything
[28:15.980 --> 28:18.060]  They have over
[28:18.060 --> 28:21.060]  150 petabytes of data backed up so far
[28:21.620 --> 28:27.120]  And they have restored over 10 billion files for their customers
[28:27.700 --> 28:32.500]  You can access all of your data from your Mac or from multiple Macs
[28:32.500 --> 28:37.020]  If you have two Macs sign up for two accounts five bucks per machine per month. That's it
[28:37.020 --> 28:39.420]  Everything's online, but you can access it anywhere
[28:39.420 --> 28:46.260]  You can use their iPhone app iPad app and get just one file when you're out and about if you need to
[28:46.260 --> 28:50.620]  You know send a file to somebody and you just log into back place from their app on your phone
[28:51.740 --> 28:56.780]  Go through all of your files that are backed up find the file you want and do whatever you want with it
[28:56.780 --> 29:02.420]  So you can download one file at a time if you have a catastrophe if you need it if a disaster actually strikes
[29:03.080 --> 29:04.420]  You just go to your account
[29:04.420 --> 29:11.500]  You can just pay and they'll just put everything from your account load it up on a USB Drive and have it overnighted to you
[29:12.280 --> 29:16.700]  So you can restore one one file at a time from anywhere you want get all of your files
[29:17.620 --> 29:19.620]  Put on a USB hard drive
[29:19.740 --> 29:24.180]  Whatever you need 25% of all of their restores though are just one file at a time
[29:24.180 --> 29:31.340]  It's once you have the ability to get any of your files anywhere you realize it's more than just like backup or recovery from
[29:31.340 --> 29:33.940]  Catastrophe, it's it's really about convenience
[29:34.720 --> 29:42.680]  Really great software. I recommend it so wholeheartedly. I've got it on every Mac in the house here at during fireball headquarters
[29:43.300 --> 29:47.540]  And like I said, it's a risk-free no credit card required trial
[29:47.540 --> 29:50.620]  So you have nothing to lose just by trying it if you haven't yet
[29:50.900 --> 29:57.100]  Don't put it off putting off getting a backup system in place worst thing you can do because that's when Murphy's law will hit
[29:57.100 --> 29:59.100]  So just go here go to back blaze
[29:59.100 --> 30:01.100]  calm

[30:14.760 --> 30:16.760]  So music
[30:18.780 --> 30:22.380]  Part of the news of the last week was this crazy to me
[30:22.380 --> 30:27.260]  It it it the Taylor Swift story, right so
[30:28.260 --> 30:36.260]  Recording here on Friday, June 26, and it was last Sunday where Taylor Swift wrote a blog post
[30:36.260 --> 30:38.260]  post on her tumblr account
[30:38.260 --> 30:46.140]  More or less calling taking Apple to task for the fact that in the in the free trial for Apple music
[30:46.140 --> 30:53.660]  The three-month free trial Apple wasn't going to pay artists for the music that got streamed. They were only gonna pay
[30:54.260 --> 31:01.420]  a percentage based on you know, the paid accounts once the free trial period is over and Taylor Swift's argument was
[31:02.260 --> 31:05.760]  This isn't right, you know, the free trial is a promotion for your service
[31:05.760 --> 31:09.100]  we should get you know, we the artist should get paid no matter what and and
[31:09.100 --> 31:15.580]  It not only worked it worked by the end of the day by the end of the day at EQ
[31:16.740 --> 31:22.720]  You know this Apple senior vice president in charge of music among other things was tweeting that
[31:23.300 --> 31:29.820]  Okay, I've called Taylor Swift. We've worked it out and and we'll be paying artists even during the free trial period
[31:30.980 --> 31:35.220]  I'm kind of blown away by that just by the speed at which it happened and how it kind of
[31:35.220 --> 31:41.900]  In terms of being a longtime Apple observer that it it like the public aspect of it that it took place
[31:42.540 --> 31:45.640]  You know from one Apple executives Twitter account
[31:46.260 --> 31:53.060]  Yeah, I was yeah, I was watching it and I was I was I was bemused. I I personally I
[31:55.180 --> 31:58.940]  Didn't have an opinion on it on one way that I think this is just business
[31:58.940 --> 32:06.620]  You know terms terms and conditions that are in contracts are often negotiable and sometimes you use boilerplate
[32:07.580 --> 32:11.740]  That might not you know be appropriate for everybody and you know
[32:12.700 --> 32:18.340]  Then you change it and and that's that's what we call negotiation and it wasn't to me
[32:18.340 --> 32:20.060]  This is just a matter of business
[32:20.060 --> 32:23.900]  But the I think the noteworthy thing was your you know
[32:23.900 --> 32:30.620]  Your observation that they were so responsive to it in such a public way and then fact that so negotiation took place
[32:30.900 --> 32:33.540]  in public on on on Twitter
[32:35.260 --> 32:40.900]  That that amuses me greatly I'm not outraged, you know, in fact, I refuse to be outraged anymore
[32:41.980 --> 32:46.460]  About anything so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a little bit just
[32:48.140 --> 32:52.180]  Just reflecting on on the age we live in that this is happening and
[32:52.180 --> 32:55.140]  In the end it turns out very well for everybody
[32:55.140 --> 33:00.220]  I don't think this was a big deal for Apple to even do it initially
[33:00.220 --> 33:04.940]  But they just probably wasn't something that they thought of they said well, it's just standard practice. You know that
[33:06.100 --> 33:10.500]  Yes, it's our service. But it's it's it's in the end. They're gonna grow your business as well
[33:10.500 --> 33:14.300]  So, you know where we think of it as a partnership, so we both take a hit
[33:14.620 --> 33:18.740]  But at the end he said they said all right. Well, we'll absorb that
[33:18.740 --> 33:25.500]  That cost up front and pass it on because you're right, you know, we're probably very well off. It's money
[33:25.500 --> 33:28.580]  we don't need as much as you do, but it you know, it's
[33:29.620 --> 33:33.380]  It's just the way it happened. I guess that's what's interesting same to me
[33:33.380 --> 33:37.980]  And I feel like it's also further sign that and I think Apple accepts this
[33:37.980 --> 33:43.340]  I don't think there's any other way but with the success that they've had and the size that they've grown to a
[33:43.340 --> 33:51.180]  Lot of the times when something like this happens, there's no way that they can truly win because I saw people saying the next day
[33:51.180 --> 33:54.860]  Like on Monday that this is sort of makes Apple look weak
[33:54.860 --> 33:59.920]  It makes them you know that they capitulated that they that they gave in, you know
[34:00.420 --> 34:06.000]  And it doesn't make Apple look good that that they scrambled to do this. Whereas
[34:06.000 --> 34:12.960]  My guess is is that inside Apple that their take on this is why not make it look like?
[34:13.280 --> 34:20.400]  We're paying attention because we are paying attention, right? I mean, it's you know, we saw the tailors. Why put it off
[34:20.400 --> 34:24.440]  Why why why make it look why wait a week or two and make it look like?
[34:25.200 --> 34:30.540]  We're a black box who doesn't respond to stuff like this or like we called our lawyers and we called our you know
[34:30.540 --> 34:36.460]  Consultants or something. Yeah, that it's it's it's clear. I think it's as simple as what Eddie Q
[34:36.460 --> 34:39.940]  Said that he and Tim Cook talked on the phone Sunday and said, all right
[34:39.940 --> 34:44.620]  We'll just you know, we'll pay him during the trial period. I mean, yeah exactly and then so
[34:45.260 --> 34:46.280]  And by the way
[34:46.280 --> 34:50.120]  I think the reason Apple is in the business of music anyways because they love music as they say
[34:50.180 --> 34:56.060]  Many times over and over again again one of these statements that people just you know, it just goes right over over
[34:56.060 --> 35:02.780]  Consciousness because they say it all the time, you know, we love music and by saying we love music they're not just saying yeah
[35:02.780 --> 35:07.040]  We love being and you know, remember the the dancing of
[35:07.680 --> 35:13.640]  Betty Q on stage. It's the point is that they do love music because actually they think that that's a core
[35:14.260 --> 35:19.480]  That's a cornerstone of the business. That is they want to be seen as a brand
[35:20.400 --> 35:23.900]  associated with music musicians and artists and creative people
[35:23.900 --> 35:28.460]  Going back to think different who did they put up on the think different campaign?
[35:28.460 --> 35:33.020]  They're all people who are creative people fundamentally whether they were scientific artistic
[35:33.740 --> 35:35.620]  cultural
[35:35.620 --> 35:41.060]  Social creative people and so the idea is that that's what the brand rests on
[35:41.060 --> 35:44.260]  And so I don't know anybody who would think that Apple
[35:45.060 --> 35:47.060]  benefits by being a tough guy
[35:47.300 --> 35:52.660]  With artists they come to the story. They're coming to this to the table with music. In fact
[35:52.660 --> 35:55.480]  Spending all that money on a music
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.040]  The the acquisition of beats was spending a ton of billions of dollars on the company founded by musicians or music
[36:03.680 --> 36:05.280]  executive
[36:05.280 --> 36:11.120]  You know a partner with them with them with the musician and that the whole company is like saying
[36:11.240 --> 36:13.760]  Trying to tell the world we're on the we want
[36:15.160 --> 36:21.480]  Creativity to flourish and and we want our tools to be used by creative people's we're on their side
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.880]  We're on your side to to and you know addressing their customer in a way
[36:25.880 --> 36:32.160]  And so that what that is why if if they quote cave in to them, they're just saying look
[36:32.160 --> 36:37.640]  We're just being overly, you know, the fault is is that we're being actually overly generous
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.040]  When maybe a cynical view would be that we ought to be much more
[36:44.180 --> 36:50.160]  You know tight tight with money and that's not a good thing to come across as being being
[36:50.160 --> 36:56.960]  Being restrictive with your with your with your terms you can be restrictive when you're dealing with another company
[36:56.960 --> 36:58.600]  And I'm sure they drive a hard bargain
[36:58.600 --> 37:03.680]  but when it comes to artists the way you want to project is that you're being very generous and
[37:03.800 --> 37:06.800]  That that therefore reflects on also on developers
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.520]  Ultimately who are part of the ecosystem and so I think it's it turns out well the only people who are going to be
[37:14.240 --> 37:17.360]  Who are going to be critical of the this of that decision? I think are
[37:17.360 --> 37:21.480]  Are cynics because I don't I don't think Apple's brand is about
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.120]  being being a
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.000]  Being a confrontational with those who
[37:30.080 --> 37:32.080]  Who use its tools?
[37:32.720 --> 37:39.400]  Yeah, I agree with that and I think I saw some of that cynicism in in the aftermath of this, you know
[37:39.400 --> 37:39.840]  Okay
[37:39.840 --> 37:40.120]  well
[37:40.120 --> 37:45.000]  You know will pay you during the free trial thing if it's if that's such a sticking point and I think the truth of it
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.320]  Is that it's so little money to Apple
[37:47.320 --> 37:53.880]  I mean there, you know, the terms have leaked and apparently this is fairly standard across the industry
[37:53.880 --> 37:58.560]  You know Spotify is paying somewhere around the same amount where it's about
[37:59.280 --> 38:02.640]  two tenths of one cent per play
[38:03.240 --> 38:05.240]  for for streaming
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.360]  so in other words five
[38:07.360 --> 38:14.120]  Streams to get one penny in payment, which is so little money no matter how popular this thing gets
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.960]  I mean just a little back-of-the-envelope math, but if you know it, you know, like a hundred billion
[38:19.600 --> 38:21.600]  plays is
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.040]  It times wait, let me think I've got to make sure I get this right hundred this right hundred billion
[38:30.880 --> 38:32.880]  All right times
[38:33.400 --> 38:35.400]  point zero zero two
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.280]  Is only two hundred million dollars, which is a long, you know
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.400]  I it's yeah, it's just I don't even know
[38:43.480 --> 38:49.680]  They paid the three billion for beats and you know, it's it would be a long time before they paid three billion
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.000]  In in fees just for and this is just talking about the free trial period right once people pay for the ten dollar a month
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.320]  Thing the payments will all come out of you know, there's no charity involved
[39:02.320 --> 39:06.360]  there's no, you know that Apple's not eating the cost of anything everything will come out of a
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.240]  percentage of what people are actually paying
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.440]  So it it doesn't matter how popular Apple music
[39:13.440 --> 39:19.120]  It is how many people sign up for this free trial and how many songs they play on it
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.600]  It just can't add up to an overall
[39:22.400 --> 39:28.960]  meaningful number for Apple in terms of what they would be paying so I think the idea that and and the idea that they were
[39:28.960 --> 39:30.720]  trying to squeeze that
[39:30.720 --> 39:37.000]  Minuscule amount of millions of dollars because that ultimately it's gonna be into millions not billions no matter where it falls
[39:37.160 --> 39:42.720]  The idea that they were trying to screw artists out of that and take advantage of them in the free period I think is is
[39:43.160 --> 39:47.080]  It's too cynical. I mean, it's certainly possible, but it just doesn't sound right to me
[39:47.080 --> 39:50.720]  I think that it's exactly what they said, which is that
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.920]  they're hoping that they're gonna get so many people onto paid accounts and
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Therefore have like a real
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.840]  sustainable model for artists to get paid for digital streaming that
[40:04.880 --> 40:08.080]  you know it they just saw that free trial as a way for
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.680]  Everybody to sort of benefit from the long term of having people signed up for actual paid accounts
[40:14.080 --> 40:20.000]  And that's the way it works. I mean when you're when the point of free trials is that everybody who's
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.280]  You're doing it because you want to gain people's
[40:24.280 --> 40:27.960]  Business and you want to gain people's attentions?
[40:27.960 --> 40:35.180]  And and it makes a lot of sense to to in this case because also there isn't a cost in giving it away
[40:35.600 --> 40:37.600]  Remember, this is digital media. So
[40:38.160 --> 40:42.600]  If they listen to those streams, maybe those streams where I've never gotten listened to
[40:42.600 --> 40:48.160]  It's not that they're gonna stop listening and somewhere where they are paying and then start listening on this service
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.360]  Or maybe they will but you know
[40:50.360 --> 40:57.560]  They'll shut off Spotify and some some artists might see a decrease in revenue for for this trial period but generally again
[40:57.560 --> 41:00.560]  these are these are very small amounts and I I
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.720]  Think this is what this is one of those things that I felt that I wasn't I
[41:05.040 --> 41:08.720]  Wasn't motivated by it enough to even make a comment about it. So I
[41:10.440 --> 41:13.640]  To me that the news is in in in the way it happened
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.240]  What what the outcome was? Yeah, I think so, too
[41:17.240 --> 41:24.800]  I'm definitely curious to see how popular album music becomes but it's yeah, it's sort of outside my purview
[41:24.800 --> 41:30.760]  I'm just not into popular music. So I don't know nor am I and that's been a that's something I'm embarrassed about
[41:30.760 --> 41:37.920]  But they but then again they get to a certain age one thing I have is as a as a as a theory about
[41:38.840 --> 41:45.040]  The human condition. It's that when music discoveries is a young man young man or young woman's
[41:45.040 --> 41:47.040]  problem
[41:47.680 --> 41:53.280]  When you get to a certain age, you know what you like and you've already probably got it. And so
[41:54.040 --> 41:55.520]  very few
[41:55.520 --> 41:57.320]  people get
[41:57.320 --> 41:59.720]  are interested in new music at a certain age and
[42:00.440 --> 42:07.600]  And so that's why the genres break into a nostalgia and you know, you can get a radio station for every decade
[42:08.280 --> 42:13.200]  because people want to go back to that time when they were young and that was the formative years where
[42:13.200 --> 42:15.600]  where that music speaks to them and
[42:16.360 --> 42:20.300]  by the way, the interesting thing is that there wasn't such a thing in the
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.980]  1960s because the industry was so new and there wasn't
[42:26.200 --> 42:33.280]  the the idea of popular music was just recently created so the nostalgia would have been for jazz or for for
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.520]  For that sort of music that the 1920s forget the names of some of those
[42:40.480 --> 42:42.480]  types of music then but
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.920]  and it wasn't recorded and so people weren't gonna go back to to
[42:47.840 --> 42:53.760]  To try to relive that time with through music. So it's a very much a phenomenon of the 20th century
[42:53.760 --> 43:00.360]  I loved one thing about the music event or the music part of the event that that I think didn't maybe
[43:00.840 --> 43:08.860]  Rise high enough in consciousness was that video they showed where they they narrated through imagery the how music changed over the years
[43:08.860 --> 43:13.140]  And I think they missed a little bit with that video because it wasn't narrated
[43:13.140 --> 43:18.780]  They just had images only but then there the way you stood you could read that narration is like if you go back in history
[43:20.060 --> 43:22.320]  Ever since music became a recorded
[43:22.900 --> 43:29.140]  product it's changed not just in the form of the medium or the the media that was used to
[43:29.500 --> 43:35.380]  capture it from from vinyl to to tape to CD but also because of those
[43:35.380 --> 43:41.220]  At that time the music that way in my language would be it was hired for different things
[43:41.860 --> 43:42.940]  the you know
[43:42.940 --> 43:44.940]  the first record players were
[43:45.140 --> 43:52.500]  We're hired to play music in the in the living room to the whole family and you probably probably have a very few records
[43:52.500 --> 43:56.460]  And maybe you would actually dance to them in a formal way
[43:56.460 --> 44:02.060]  and and so over time you see how music became a different thing and and
[44:02.060 --> 44:08.020]  With when it became concentrated enough and portable enough so that you could carry
[44:08.260 --> 44:13.620]  500 song or thousand songs in your pocket then it became yet another thing and and then when it
[44:13.900 --> 44:20.020]  Became something you you you could get on the internet through a stream it it became yet another thing
[44:20.060 --> 44:24.260]  So what you nobody would have thought in the 1960s? I would have these
[44:24.860 --> 44:30.520]  wearable headphones and I would go running with with with them to to and use music as a way to
[44:30.520 --> 44:33.800]  to to motivate myself through my workout
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.040]  or I would use these at work to to
[44:37.720 --> 44:44.160]  to isolate myself from from from the noise in the background or or I would I would wear these on that on a
[44:44.160 --> 44:51.400]  Commute that use case those types of uses for music emerged only because of the technology that was available at
[44:51.680 --> 44:57.300]  That time and so in some ways what they're saying is that we as Apple we made one of those
[44:57.300 --> 45:01.940]  Era's happen and now we're gonna move to another era and we're gonna make this happen
[45:02.460 --> 45:07.220]  For the for not just the consumer but also for the musicians and so this whole story
[45:07.220 --> 45:12.500]  I think is wonderful because it's about the evolution of music the evolution of how music was
[45:12.820 --> 45:18.180]  Consumed and what purpose it had and meaning what it had in people's lives and to the chagrin of many
[45:18.700 --> 45:20.140]  Many people in the industry
[45:20.140 --> 45:25.660]  It seems as if music has been has been devalued over time has once we've had so much of it
[45:25.660 --> 45:31.220]  And it's so easy to obtain and and that you can carry so much of it in our pockets that it's you know
[45:31.220 --> 45:38.140]  We've traded analog dollars for digital pennies and or digital dimes and then and then streaming pennies
[45:38.900 --> 45:41.740]  but so that's that's the sort of the the the
[45:44.620 --> 45:50.180]  The negative spin on it, but the positive spin is actually we consume more music than ever we're surrounded by it
[45:50.180 --> 45:53.940]  We have access to it. We we can sample we can try new things
[45:53.940 --> 45:57.600]  and so when if you were to take the positive spin on it and Apple will say
[45:58.740 --> 46:02.700]  The conversation to the artist is that hey, let us help you
[46:03.380 --> 46:09.100]  Surface this let us help you actually take advantage of technology that helps helps you
[46:10.220 --> 46:16.540]  Continue in your craft and for the consumer the same the same thing is like let's find music that that you wouldn't have ever found
[46:16.540 --> 46:22.100]  Before that is that is so inspiring or delightful and that really doesn't improve your life
[46:22.100 --> 46:25.980]  So so that's that's why Apple's in the music business
[46:25.980 --> 46:30.700]  They come in and say we're not here to figure out a new monetization strategy
[46:30.700 --> 46:36.220]  We're here to actually make sure that music survives that music is continuing to be an important part of life
[46:36.220 --> 46:40.620]  I again I sound like like a pitchman for it for the four beats
[46:40.620 --> 46:45.100]  But the idea is is is that I've thought about this for years and years when I was thinking about
[46:45.500 --> 46:47.820]  Where's the music and I end up being what?
[46:47.820 --> 46:54.220]  what what what is what is the job to be done music is hard to do and looking through history realize that that job changes and
[46:54.580 --> 46:56.700]  That you've got to change along with that
[46:57.260 --> 47:04.440]  Yeah, I think that the idea that Apple should have I've seen some people speculate, you know that hey
[47:04.440 --> 47:09.020]  Why does Apple why is Apple even bothering with this at all? They don't need to do music
[47:09.220 --> 47:13.980]  They don't need to be this involved, right? They've you know, you can you can
[47:13.980 --> 47:19.100]  Why not just let Spotify and Pandora handle it all they've got great iOS apps
[47:19.100 --> 47:20.940]  You can play them from any of your Apple devices
[47:20.940 --> 47:24.940]  Why does Apple even need to do this and I think it's because I think it's what you said
[47:24.940 --> 47:28.140]  I think it's because they want to because they really think music is
[47:28.940 --> 47:30.940]  Part of what they want their company to be
[47:31.420 --> 47:38.020]  Yeah, it reminds me of a conversation once I had with someone at Pixar and I said, why don't you guys go into?
[47:39.060 --> 47:40.780]  doing TV
[47:40.780 --> 47:42.780]  Because you've got these great storytelling
[47:42.780 --> 47:45.980]  Techniques and tools and things like that. Why don't you?
[47:46.780 --> 47:53.340]  they make shorts and movies and nothing in between and they were like the answer was because we love movies and
[47:54.140 --> 47:56.140]  I had no way to
[47:56.860 --> 48:02.580]  I was taken aback. I was like, oh, yeah, of course, you know, it's it's here
[48:02.580 --> 48:06.140]  I am thinking like a technician or I'm trying to segment the world by
[48:06.660 --> 48:12.100]  What is possible and and at the end the decision is like no we just love stuff
[48:12.100 --> 48:17.140]  And that's why we do things if we don't if we did things that we didn't love that we wouldn't it wouldn't be good at
[48:17.140 --> 48:20.740]  All and so the formula of Pixar isn't just like we know how to turn the crank
[48:20.740 --> 48:26.900]  It's like we really are passionate and the passion is key. And so in this case, it's I think it's the same thing
[48:26.900 --> 48:32.380]  I mean, why is Apple in anything? Why shouldn't they just leave leave payments to someone else?
[48:32.380 --> 48:37.140]  Why should they be be trying to make better photographs? Why should they be trying to make better?
[48:37.140 --> 48:43.340]  You know even movies with iMovie and even though nobody's using it or why isn't you know?
[48:43.340 --> 48:45.620]  Why are they doing I work at all? Is that stupid?
[48:45.620 --> 48:52.300]  You know, why why get into that and kill it kill it every time I hear is like shut it down shut down Apple TV
[48:52.300 --> 48:56.700]  It's a failure shut down this and that and I always think that look they didn't get into it
[48:57.060 --> 49:03.900]  Just for that purpose to sort of make money or to become a success by your your definition of it
[49:03.900 --> 49:09.260]  They probably do it because they think it's far part of their fiber and it's it's something that they feel that that
[49:09.420 --> 49:15.220]  Will complete them or or the you know, just and I don't want to make it seem like, you know
[49:15.220 --> 49:17.020]  There's some kind of an artistic entity
[49:17.020 --> 49:22.460]  But it but when they ask artists this question is like why did you paint this thing and not show it to anybody said?
[49:22.460 --> 49:26.100]  Well, I had to get it out. I had to get it out and I don't care if anybody sees it
[49:26.580 --> 49:32.940]  in some ways you ought to think about business this way because this is this is the the the this is the
[49:32.940 --> 49:34.580]  as a sort of
[49:34.580 --> 49:39.100]  antithesis of an analytic approach is actually one of being entirely
[49:40.820 --> 49:48.500]  Empathy based and so the but but that empathy allows you to to create greatness and it may lead you to to that one
[49:49.140 --> 49:53.280]  Great business as well, but it doesn't happen through a deliberate act
[49:53.280 --> 50:00.620]  It happens through a discovery act and so this is the this is why when they make choices that are based on these these
[50:00.620 --> 50:08.620]  These instincts and and people say well, it's not economical or it doesn't make sense or the the they're stepping on toes
[50:08.620 --> 50:14.020]  And things like that one on one hand on Apple that that's that's the narrative on the other hand on Google
[50:14.020 --> 50:16.860]  Nobody complains that they get into all kinds of crazy moonshots
[50:17.540 --> 50:21.700]  And they all applaud, you know in the if Apple, however, even slightly
[50:22.580 --> 50:25.940]  Veers off of what is thought to be the well trodden path
[50:25.940 --> 50:31.860]  Then then people's you know jump up with criticism and and oh, this is the end of Apple
[50:31.860 --> 50:35.940]  This is obviously this is not their forte. There should not be in this etc. Etc
[50:36.980 --> 50:38.580]  Hey
[50:38.580 --> 50:45.340]  It's it's some people do R&D. Some people do moonshots and Apple just wants to do wants to in you know
[50:45.540 --> 50:53.000]  Indulge some ideas about what they think is important or education. For example, why are they in education?
[50:53.000 --> 50:58.760]  Why are you getting into health care? Why are they getting into fitness tracking? Are these all money-making opportunities?
[50:59.260 --> 51:05.300]  Someday, but you know, I I don't see a way I could put that on the spreadsheet and I don't care either
[51:05.300 --> 51:10.800]  It's about really doing things which they think stitch together into a fiber that holds up the whole thing
[51:10.800 --> 51:13.100]  And that's that's the business of Apple
[51:13.100 --> 51:18.140]  I think that's not and maybe that is a new business of Apple because if in Steve Jobs time
[51:18.140 --> 51:20.840]  There would have been more there would have been a little bit less diverse
[51:20.840 --> 51:22.840]  diversification
[51:22.880 --> 51:24.880]  but it's still
[51:25.240 --> 51:28.840]  to me this is this is because the the fiber is so much broader and
[51:29.200 --> 51:35.080]  And and there needs to be so much more to support billions of or potential billions of users
[51:35.080 --> 51:41.720]  I think fundamental to the culture of Apple the corporate culture and it definitely started with Steve Jobs
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.560]  without question and it was deliberate and
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.120]  Continues to have unforeseen
[51:48.120 --> 51:52.880]  Consequences and allows Apple to do things you may not, you know
[51:52.880 --> 51:57.640]  Ten years from now that we wouldn't have predicted today is the fact that they don't do
[51:58.600 --> 51:59.920]  a
[51:59.920 --> 52:03.520]  P&L for each product or division or well
[52:03.520 --> 52:08.800]  However, you want to talk about it that they're not set up as a as a they don't have divisions within the company
[52:08.800 --> 52:11.520]  They're they're completely functionally organized
[52:11.520 --> 52:18.360]  In fact, they're more functionally organized than then even before with Steve Jobs where where Johnny Ives
[52:19.200 --> 52:23.240]  Team took over design of everything not just hardware design
[52:23.240 --> 52:29.720]  But that with the forestall ouster and taking over all of software design that there weren't separate, you know
[52:29.720 --> 52:36.680]  There wasn't one team doing iOS design. They created a new function and with design that's really deep and exactly right
[52:36.680 --> 52:41.680]  And this is something I've been I'm glad you brought it up because I think it's one of the most under
[52:42.800 --> 52:50.480]  under understood aspects of the the the Apple algorithm, which is that they they they essentially said no to
[52:51.880 --> 52:57.400]  To a divisional organization, which which see here's the narrative I have on it, which is that
[52:58.120 --> 53:03.680]  That's fine for small companies. In fact, if you're a startup you are by default a functional organization
[53:03.680 --> 53:09.160]  It it makes sense that you're gonna have a somebody you're usually a person is a function and that's it
[53:09.160 --> 53:14.400]  It's not that many of you but as you grow it makes sense people think it's logical now
[53:14.400 --> 53:20.480]  Okay. Now we have to divide according to where the money comes from. So if you know if we've got a product, okay
[53:20.480 --> 53:22.260]  I'm gonna put somebody in charge of that product
[53:22.260 --> 53:28.400]  I'm gonna put somebody in if it's in fact geographical because your sales structure is that way then you do geographical segments or
[53:28.400 --> 53:34.640]  Or something like that in the you organize according to whatever means you decide the money comes in
[53:35.240 --> 53:40.360]  and and that's the thing is that the money starts to lead your thinking and and and
[53:41.120 --> 53:43.320]  Optimization becomes the the rule of the day
[53:43.320 --> 53:48.040]  It's like how can I hold that person responsible to do the best thing for that?
[53:48.480 --> 53:56.300]  For that particular flow of money that's coming in to optimize it. And so and so that's how divisional organizations
[53:56.300 --> 54:02.740]  Evolve in and in fact General Motors was probably the pioneer in that area back at you know
[54:02.740 --> 54:04.740]  a hundred years ago or so or so
[54:04.900 --> 54:06.900]  so this idea of
[54:06.900 --> 54:08.620]  divisional
[54:08.620 --> 54:11.020]  logic is is is
[54:11.540 --> 54:18.380]  Pervasive in the world and and it also makes sense when you're managing people in the thousands and thousands of people you want to be
[54:18.380 --> 54:24.660]  able to create the incentives for them to align according to certain goals and and so the
[54:24.660 --> 54:30.500]  pyramid of that division is is set up so that everybody knows what the target is and
[54:30.780 --> 54:34.060]  Therefore their their paycheck is is tied to that in some way
[54:34.780 --> 54:39.980]  And and so people then know what they're what you don't need to tell them every day what to do
[54:39.980 --> 54:47.180]  They'll have that in their incentives built in but and that doesn't work for an organization where which is like Apple
[54:47.180 --> 54:51.000]  Which is functional because you're not attached to a product you might be one day
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.740]  But not the other and then and then you're sort of you never even part of the P&L
[54:57.260 --> 54:59.260]  logic is that you you you
[54:59.700 --> 55:05.900]  You report some of that data and people know how things are going and and so there's a communication
[55:06.620 --> 55:11.220]  happens through the knowledge of what's happening right and and so
[55:12.340 --> 55:17.340]  bottom line is that Apple's lack of a P&L a structure means that
[55:17.340 --> 55:22.900]  People within the organization will you'll have hard time motivating them. You'll have a hard time
[55:23.740 --> 55:26.060]  figuring out what their responsibilities are
[55:26.460 --> 55:32.420]  figuring out how they can navigate their own personal careers so that they can they can maybe
[55:32.700 --> 55:40.220]  Optimize their own career because the signal of pricing and the signal of profit was used to guide you and
[55:40.860 --> 55:43.580]  Or would guide you if you were in a divisional organization
[55:43.580 --> 55:48.380]  Oh, so we have to be impressed by is how actually
[55:49.140 --> 55:55.220]  Difficult it is to do what Apple is doing because it actually makes running that business really really hard
[55:55.220 --> 56:01.860]  And in fact, it may cause some people to just say I quit I had this doesn't I can't I can't make sense of it
[56:01.860 --> 56:07.540]  I can't progress in my career because of this and so there's a lot of heartache that comes with it and
[56:07.540 --> 56:14.120]  There's a lot of chaos that comes with it. And so this is why every company it gets grows up
[56:14.120 --> 56:19.780]  You know the certain stage abandons this logic and here's Apple which is now I don't know how many 50,000 or more
[56:20.420 --> 56:25.660]  People is still able to continue in that way to really it's hard. It's hard to put a headcount on Apple
[56:25.780 --> 56:28.860]  Yeah, unless you say so that yeah separate the retail out
[56:28.860 --> 56:32.620]  I think you might be right that it's probably 50 or 60 now
[56:32.620 --> 56:38.780]  It's it's explosively grown eat non-retail has grown tremendously in the last five years
[56:39.020 --> 56:42.380]  Yeah, it was I think was Don Melton that pointed this out to me
[56:42.380 --> 56:45.820]  So did you know Apple is the largest functional organization outside of the US Army?
[56:46.900 --> 56:48.420]  It may be other foreign armies
[56:48.420 --> 56:54.500]  But the idea is that and then you I saw in that that pot when he said that in my head went like pop because I
[56:54.500 --> 57:00.700]  Said holy cow, that's exactly why armies are the way they are. I mean the armies are way the way they are. They're actually
[57:00.700 --> 57:02.020]  organized
[57:02.020 --> 57:06.660]  The way they are because they need they need to be you know thrown at a target
[57:06.700 --> 57:10.180]  They're thrown at a mission and they have to execute on that mission
[57:10.180 --> 57:12.820]  But they're very inefficient in terms of you know
[57:12.940 --> 57:18.700]  Trying to do a blend of things and often even when you go into the into that mission. It's like it's chaos
[57:18.700 --> 57:20.700]  It's like crazy, you know
[57:20.940 --> 57:23.660]  Incompetencies emerge and then you realize that well, okay
[57:23.660 --> 57:28.460]  That's why we have war games to simulate them and sort of make sure that things run effectively and so on
[57:28.460 --> 57:31.860]  And so, you know, I got into this whole train of thought about whether
[57:32.860 --> 57:37.940]  What would happen if the US Army was divisional then you would have the head of you know
[57:37.940 --> 57:43.580]  The head of certain types of missions, so you would say do not have Air Force Marines and Army. We're gonna have
[57:44.820 --> 57:47.780]  we're gonna have a guy in head of charge of
[57:48.820 --> 57:53.140]  Attacks in the Middle East and we're gonna have a guy in charge of maybe you know
[57:53.140 --> 57:57.360]  We'll do geographically Latin America and the head of Latin America would have under him
[57:57.360 --> 57:59.600]  You know Army Air Force and and and Marines
[57:59.780 --> 58:05.300]  But the problem is that that person would gain so much power then then they would start the Joint Chiefs of Staff would kind
[58:05.300 --> 58:09.660]  Of have these debates around the big table and say, you know, you know Middle East is much more important
[58:09.660 --> 58:11.660]  I ought to get more resources
[58:11.820 --> 58:17.180]  So so so why don't you you know put 80% of the budget in the Middle East this year, mr
[58:17.180 --> 58:22.820]  President and and and you know, nobody cares about Latin America. All they're doing is is is
[58:22.820 --> 58:28.020]  Busting drug gangs, you know, I got a real fight here to fight. So so give me more money
[58:28.020 --> 58:30.920]  So then they would get it then then so one one general who ran
[58:31.100 --> 58:34.160]  That region suddenly have so much more power than the other generals
[58:34.160 --> 58:40.100]  He he could actually probably run, you know, do run his own empire run his own
[58:40.700 --> 58:46.020]  Make make make make so many decisions that he would become like the king of the Middle East
[58:46.020 --> 58:48.060]  In fact MacArthur was like that in Japan
[58:48.060 --> 58:53.820]  They he had so much authority in Japan after the war that he wrote their constitution for them practically
[58:53.820 --> 58:58.020]  He was a general and and so that was a special situation
[58:58.020 --> 59:04.920]  But when you think about it that way that this is this this this idea of people who have under them an empire
[59:05.300 --> 59:09.060]  This is the politics that this is the type of politics that that drives
[59:09.620 --> 59:15.780]  organizations into all this all this paralysis all of this mismanagement and all of this running off a cliff and
[59:15.780 --> 59:20.860]  Stupidity that we observe and and so because someone has that power structure in them
[59:20.860 --> 59:23.060]  You can imagine this in Microsoft's world, you know
[59:23.060 --> 59:23.200]  well
[59:23.200 --> 59:29.100]  the windows guys are really powerful and the office guys are really powerful and they need all the resources because they've earned them and
[59:29.140 --> 59:34.600]  So and so it goes but when you take that away you depoliticize an organization
[59:34.600 --> 59:38.980]  So you especially with the military you've got to be depoliticized a politicized military
[59:39.420 --> 59:41.680]  turns into a an object of
[59:42.380 --> 59:44.380]  coup and in and
[59:44.380 --> 59:49.180]  Yeah, this is why you have Republican guards and things like that which are politicized militaries
[59:49.180 --> 59:55.020]  Which often end up really controlling the state and in the democracy this and that's that's unacceptable
[59:55.020 --> 01:00:01.300]  and for that reason the militaries and democracies are the way they are and and this is you know, that's a long narrative, but I
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.380]  Sorry, well and not and not to go too deep down the history historical
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:11.560]  Rabbit hole, but that's why Harry Truman fired general exactly. I mean, which Harry Truman
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.900]  That's one of those things where I grew up and I heard the story and I thought well
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.720]  I guess that's the sort of thing that happens
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.880]  But then like the older I get and the more perspective I get on it
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.120]  It was sort of a bombshell, you know to the US public who viewed
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.720]  Viewed him as a you know
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.880]  He was a wartime hero. He hit he not only had beaten Japan
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.840]  But he also he had beaten Korea and and and and so or North North Korea and he he getting fired
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:43.160]  I mean a lot of so many people were upset but the he became too political put a political and that was unacceptable in a
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:50.560]  Democracy and that that to me was it was a great story to tell and and and and I think that's where you got to
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.560]  Watch out. This is the day-to-day
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.460]  fears and worries that a that a guy like Tim Cook has to deal with it's it's he's got to worry about and I
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.040]  Think you know the forestall story
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:06.900]  I think had a lot to do with whether that general became too political and didn't stick to his functional role
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.360]  In that case he had to be sacrificed even though everybody loved him
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.740]  So, you know, it's the same story. I know I think of him as the Truman
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.080]  Yeah, then as the more time is gained from that the less. Oh not Truman. Sorry McCarthy, right?
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.840]  Exactly, but I thought you meant cook as the Truman which is true
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.320]  Yeah, cook is the Truman and and forestall was it was McCarthy right now. That's it the more I see it though
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:40.160]  it's it's not just I at first I viewed it as sort of a petty more of a petty disagreement between a few
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.380]  Individuals and I think that there's something to that angle
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.880]  but I feel like long-term strategically it was about
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.440]  Making sure that the institution of the whole company was was truly more functional
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:02.540]  Whereas I feel like under Steve Jobs a lot of the functional nature of Apple came down to Jobs's singular
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.920]  role in the company not not to say that the company depended on him and couldn't you know that he was a
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.920]  Cornerstone that the company couldn't do with that. I think we're seeing that that's not true
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.660]  But I think that the functional nature of the company flew through him
[01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.500]  Yeah, and you know, you're right
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:26.040]  There's subtle differences of we generalize then we use metaphor and we use we use allegory
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.640]  But the truth is is far more complex. And so I don't want to be I
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.740]  Don't want to make it seem like it's so clear-cut that that you know, this is this tells the story
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:42.040]  But I think it's only illustrative for example, just as a as an anomaly as a counterpoint to
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.720]  To the functional thing. There's there's the eddy cues organization because eddy cue
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.700]  I see it as an empire because he's got under him
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:59.200]  Services now called and includes all the stores. It includes I work it includes the
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.040]  the new
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.240]  includes Apple TV it includes
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:12.520]  Products that are hardware software and services and that is that is it could you know, if you could spin off to eddy cue
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.120]  You know, it would be a huge business. It would be a business bigger than Amazon in my opinion
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.520]  I can hang in part. It probably dig up some numbers that would show that that that
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.600]  Eddy cues organization by itself
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.800]  You know would be valued by the market far with a good chunk of multiple
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.160]  Would be would be far an excess than what it is inside Apple, but that of course that's not gonna happen
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.760]  The point is though that is an exception to rule and and there is a good reason for that because there's this kind of
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:45.240]  Like what do you do with these pieces problem? And so and so in some ways they're there
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.960]  they're put under him and
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.440]  So if it happens, there's a reorg
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:57.160]  Dude, I would be surprised because if something may just get out of control there. I don't know. I'm not not prejudicing
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.660]  Hopefully I I think what's what's so funny with Apple today?
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:06.880]  It would be it would be almost impossible to reorganize the company. I think what they could do is is there could be like
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.240]  Departures individuals could depart maybe just
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.480]  Simply to enjoy their retirement enjoy the you know, the the wealth that they've accumulated
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.840]  Or it could be another dispute arises where there's a personality conflict between two
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.480]  senior vice presidents who need to be working together and can't get along but I to me it would just be
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.960]  it's almost more like
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:38.560]  Running like like sports, you know, like pick any sport, you know, like you if you want to talk about soccer like well
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.560]  We're gonna have to change goalkeepers
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.960]  Yeah, it's but it's still the same position. You're not really
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.280]  You're you're absolutely you're saying it right? I I just I
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:57.760]  Literally, I are on the spot thought of the rear idea and I don't I I on reflection. I think you're right
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:04.160]  I think you're right. It's not gonna be what we think of as a reorg. It might just be that that maybe they'll carve
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:10.320]  maybe they could do something with with services that's gonna grow to such an extent that
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.440]  they
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.520]  May make create that as a separate thing. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just being completely speculative
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.040]  Let me take another break here
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:26.840]  We'll take a deep breath and I'll thank our second sponsor and it's another longtime friend of the show our good friends at
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.640]  fracture
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.920]  It is sad sad. I honestly think it is that so many of our photos that we take today people
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.120]  Everybody almost everybody I know takes more photographs today
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:47.840]  Than they ever have before in their lives and it's only it's only becoming more prevalent and it's easy to see why it's because we all
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:55.400]  Have really good cameras with us all the time like two or three seconds away from being ready to snap a photo
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400]  and
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  Yet so many of the photos that we take
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.360]  Never really leave the devices that that we view them on
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:10.760]  They're just digital things that we see on digital devices when we look for them
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.040]  And I think it's actually true
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:18.840]  I think it's even true for me personally as somebody who uses fracture and has fracture prints and and and you know
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:23.120]  Talks about them all the time here that I've actually got less fewer printed photos
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.360]  now when I take more photos than I did 10 11 12 years ago when I
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.040]  Used to shoot on film and I had to have prints of everything made
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:39.600]  There's something magical about a printed photograph when it's something that means something to you. That's where fracture steps in fracture
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:48.160]  Prints your photos directly on pure glass you pick your favorite photos that you've that you've taken you send them to fracture and
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.680]  The prints come back to you printed directly on glass not a piece of paper attached to glass
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:58.560]  They just print right on the glass. I don't know what kind of voodoo they used to do it, but it looks great
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:04.640]  The prints come back to you. They've got a foam back right on the glass. That's ready to mount on the wall
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.000]  Or ready to be used
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.420]  It's just ingenious ingenious packaging that you can use to mount it on the wall
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:17.360]  Or to prop it up on a shelf or your desk or the mantle or wherever you want to put it up
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.000]  Right out of the box. So you don't need to put them in a frame
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.580]  You don't need to buy a separate frame. The picture itself is all you need to mount it on the wall. Hang it up
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.400]  Really looks great and it gives your photos the analog beauty that they deserve
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.200]  So go check them out take some photos or take some of your recent photos pick a few that are your favorites go to
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.160]  fracture me
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:50.760]  Calm fracture me calm. That's their website and use the code daring fireball use that code and
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.180]  You'll get 15% off your first order from fracture
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:08:00.820]  The prices are already great, but you can save 15% using the code daring fireball. So Mike my thanks to fracture
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.960]  So
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.520]  It's speaking about
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:13.560]  Not putting everything off in its own P&L profit and loss and looking at things, you know functionally
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:19.280]  you you wrote a recent piece on a sim Co about maps and the sort of
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:26.840]  Well more like one factor how much does it cost to run a top-notch mapping service per year and
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.940]  You came to the conclusion that it costs about two billion dollars a year
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:36.600]  Yeah, I I think it used to be one but it's closer to two now
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:43.220]  And I think that and I got that figure by looking at the financials that out that Nokia was reporting for its here product
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:44.740]  or
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.740]  Here division, which was an acquisition
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.620]  back in
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.340]  2007 actually the year the iPhone launched Nokia spent a seven billion
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:01.260]  Dollars or euros I forget on the acquisition of Mav tech which was at the time probably the best
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.740]  Map service in the world and I mean that because I was using maps in
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.020]  2005 and 6 on a mobile device
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:15.700]  item phone it backed in the pre iPhone Dark Ages and
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.340]  I
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.180]  Remember using Google Maps back then and it was horrifically bad
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.380]  I think Google Google Maps was
[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540]  Laughably bad compared to
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:36.260]  Paid services or things you could purchase by you could download the entire maps like, you know
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.660]  remember Tom Tom and and sure
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:45.860]  Those you know Garmin those guys had a down or they had a an embedded maps in in their in their
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:53.260]  Hardware or if you had an in-car system like like you would have with a high-end car back in the day
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.260]  you'd pay three four thousand dollars for the
[01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:04.300]  Onboard navigation which was a DVD usually that wasn't you know, that was upgradeable if you paid that's exactly why we bought the car
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.740]  We have we bought in 2006 still driving it
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:14.520]  And I think we turned down it was a four thousand dollar upgrade to get inboard navigation
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.760]  wait, which in hindsight it for there were a couple of years there where my wife gave me a hard time about that and in
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.760]  Hindsight really looks like a very good decision and at the time you could get a handheld
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:31.960]  Navigator and you or you could get like very rarely and these were only in some Nokia devices that you could get
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:38.560]  Usually was an SD card that had maps data for the region you were in and you could pop that in very few
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:44.180]  Actually, none I think were directly over the air Google started offering over the air
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:48.720]  But again, it was horrible and I remember using it in those years. I was in I was in Boston
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.760]  I was actually working at Nokia's offices over in
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:57.280]  By 128 and I remember using it every every afternoon going home
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:05.400]  I would open it up on a Nokia sort of blackberry style phone and I would have this tiny square screen and I would pop in
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.920]  through the through the online through sorry through through
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:16.880]  the network at the time which would have been probably 2g or two and a half G and I would get to see my route home and
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.560]  I would look for the traffic data because there was that was that was really the only value for me is like how bad was
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.080]  The traffic when I would have when I would drive home, but that was it
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.600]  That was no really discovering where to go eat or anything like that. That was maps based
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.160]  So at that time at that time
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:40.640]  App, you know Nokia thought we've got to spend seven billion dollars on maps and the the thing about
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.640]  Nokia throughout the years I was there is that they're really really
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:54.480]  Forward-thinking they thought about smartphones ten years before anybody else did they thought about maps ten years before they got good enough and if anything
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.800]  They just were too early on everything
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:04.320]  And and then focus on the things that needed to be improved rather they said okay we buy the assets or we commit to the strategy
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.040]  And they they they thought that was enough
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:15.600]  They didn't have the ability to really really get their get this thing sorted out. So so so long story short
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.440]  So so they buy nafta for for billions of dollars
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.280]  And then you they would report their revenues and they would report their revenue
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.280]  So from that we could work out just how much they were spending to maintain
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:34.160]  That seven billion dollar asset to maintain the data in it and of course nowadays people would say that
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.760]  Here maps is not as good by the way here the maps business
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.080]  Did have revenues for them because they were selling these data sets to the car makers
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.880]  So they were selling them to mercedes and porsche and whoever
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.080]  To put on those DVDs in their cars
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:55.600]  And put in the sd cards if you were willing to you know, buy that service. So nafta's business was a real business
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.400]  It wasn't an ad-driven business. It wasn't based on on selling devices
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:08.160]  It was based on selling the actually hard-earned data and they had 400 people who every day got into cars
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.560]  to go collect data
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560]  by driving around and
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.160]  They would also source data from satellites. They would source data from I mean satellite companies they would source data from
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:25.600]  Geo position and no there's there's these huge data sets that mostly were not consumer based right? These were for companies
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.040]  And and so so this was an amazingly valuable
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.800]  Idea that that maps are going to be someday very important in mobile and that maps therefore
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:43.680]  The nokia thought by owning that asset and there weren't very many others. Uh, you you in fact
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.120]  They were coming with the baggage of hardware like by garmin and tom-tom
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.080]  And so instead they said no there's a pure pure asset. We're gonna buy it and we're gonna be the best map service in the world
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.200]  And at that time i'd argue. Yes, they were google was a joke
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.240]  And and the funny thing to me was a few years later when finally apple
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:07.920]  Gets into the maps business people say that their maps are a joke and I I just remembered google
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:13.120]  I didn't I didn't think that that was a relevant argument because I remembered that google got better
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.200]  So the only question in my mind was not are they any good at the launch? Of course, they're not good at the launch
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.320]  They're just getting started on something that people have been doing for 20 years
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.640]  And google itself had been doing for seven years or six years and of course google had a six-year lead and of course
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.800]  They're going to be better. So let's look at it six years from now. And so and so
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.560]  uh, and I knew that they would have to spend the kind of money that that that that just to maintain
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.280]  The here maps service or navtech cost a billion dollars a year
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:49.360]  So in order to obtain the depth of knowledge that that to catch up you'd have to be spending more than that
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.120]  now no one's confirmed or denied the 2 billion figure but I I you know, I I would say that's
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.880]  Credible, uh, the the the amount of effort going in is at that level
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.560]  And uh, and so that's how I got that number. I I will put a link to to the piece in the show notes
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.760]  I know I often say that and I forget to but i've already got it in my notes
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:12.080]  So it'll be there but you make a good case for why it's I think in the ballpark
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.280]  It's got to be pretty close and there is a lot. There's just a lot of ongoing legwork to run a modern mapping service
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.280]  I mean you need those drivers
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:28.880]  Mapping service. I mean you need those drivers out on the streets taking the pictures of the stores and i'll give you
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.480]  I'll give you another example
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.800]  And this is from a friend of mine who I met at uh, actually at uh, last I met was at all, you know
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:44.400]  Paul campbell's show in uh in ireland and uh, and he ran a service in prague. He was american
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:51.680]  He ran a service in prague germany. Oh, so prague czech republic. Sorry, uh, where where uh, he uh would
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.920]  pay
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:01.680]  uh college students to walk around the city and make notes about the opening times of every restaurant every
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.640]  Place you could walk bar everything you could walk into so the address the the in the in the in the and the the details
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.680]  About you know, what was on the on the door that that gave you information? That was
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.440]  About that establishment. And so what he he would aggregate that data and overlay it on public open source maps
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.920]  And provide that as a tourist
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:29.520]  Uh atlas so so he would uh, let you download so so you would download this and not pay roaming charges
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:36.560]  So may imagine you're visiting from italy to prague and you're an italian and you you get the the map of prague from him
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.880]  And allow gives you this level of detail now
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.200]  The reason he was in business is because google maps would have cost you a lot in roaming fees
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.320]  So in europe, it made sense that you could do you could do every city this way
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:52.880]  But then the real amazing story he told me was that google came to him and said why don't you just uh license this
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.720]  All this data to us they didn't have it. Google didn't have this data
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:02.880]  so so he did a deal with google where he's you know, and he felt he had he had been wronged in it because they offered
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.880]  Him like we'll just put your name down at the bottom of each page. We won't pay you anything
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.880]  We'll put your name down at the bottom
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:15.200]  And so that'll be a link. So you're going to get a lot of business from from being exposed via via google maps
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600]  And it turned out that that wasn't worth very much
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.520]  Uh, so he felt that you know that that was a bad deal and got out of it later
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.680]  but but but that you know, but the idea is that then that google itself in order to to
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.680]  To get this information does all kinds of deals, right?
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.800]  It either sends people on its own or in this case through another person who did all this work
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.320]  You know has college students doing because college students are fairly cheap and they're going around by foot
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.600]  Anyway, walking around the city thinking they're you know, they're discovering the world and by the way here
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.240]  you're going to be paid a couple of dollars if you if you if you jot down this data every time you pass a
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:18:00.640]  Doorway, and so this this model of really low level crowd sourcing data is truly labor intensive
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.760]  And it ends up costing a lot of money and then cleaning it up and so it's sending it all to india to help
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:11.360]  It to have it to have it uh, uh rationalized and and and fixed and all that stuff
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.360]  So there's a huge amount of effort there as well
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:19.600]  And then they then they go off and then do 3d then they go off and do do underground and internal maps
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:25.280]  And then you know on and on it goes the demands of these maps are suddenly we want to have every single thing
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.280]  We want flyovers. We want uh
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320]  We we want uh, uh
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.760]  The you know vector maps we don't we're not happy with bitmaps, right?
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.200]  So all of that adds a huge amount of cost and and uh, and so if this is the game
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:42.400]  uh, you wonder then why are they doing it because
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.320]  You've got to make the money back somehow and and it gets tough to
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:53.760]  Understand the logic, uh that that uh, that that exists besides the ones we see now
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:59.840]  Which are basically google maps advertising based and apple essentially saying that our devices are worth it
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:05.520]  And uh, and so I asked the question, uh, what else can we expect for business models?
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:12.480]  As far as maps are concerned into the future and I lead to you know, thinking about transportation and and autonomous vehicles
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.040]  Yeah, well, it's part of your analysis and I love this. I never really thought about it
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:23.840]  But if you if you know starting with the idea that it takes about two billion dollars per year to maintain a modern mapping service
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.840]  That you can work out rough estimates of how many users
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.320]  The major mapping services have and then you can divide and figure out. What does it cost per user per year?
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.720]  And your your estimates you come out with the so google maps is the leading map service in in the world
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:48.080]  Costs about cost them about two dollars per user per year. So to be profitable now i'm reading right from your post
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.240]  Google would need to find ad revenues of two dollars per user per year
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.720]  With apple with fewer users, but with a majority of ios users
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.080]  By all accounts there apple is spending about six seven dollars a year
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:09.600]  Per user per year and to make to justify that they really just need to you know
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:16.160]  Find six or seven dollars of value in the ipads and iphones that people are buying which I you know
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.160]  As you said certainly seems reasonable
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.680]  And then you get to nokia here and it's costing them
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:31.760]  66 dollars per year per user because they've only got 30 million users at this point and you can if you were to bundle it
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:35.840]  With with with the old nokia. I mean microsoft nokia because actually
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.600]  Now they exist without any users. So they're having what they're doing is they licensed it to microsoft
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.760]  So microsoft is a probably only paying
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.760]  nokia, you know a couple of dollars like they would let's say for for
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.920]  For uh, let's say a blend between apple and google like some let's say five bucks a year for per user
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:58.080]  And that just doesn't cover their cost. So they'd have to find other revenue and they do like I said
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.240]  They always been selling to to car makers
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:08.480]  But that makes it you know, that's why the car in that that's why the car guys are selling, you know asking four thousand dollars
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:14.160]  Uh, you know, they're probably paying uh, the the data vendor like three four hundred dollars per you know
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.480]  Their markups are huge and they're very inefficient. But
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.200]  But that that's the that's per vehicle pricing. It's probably in the hundreds of dollars
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.840]  But again long now it's up for sale and it's still losing money as it is right and and the question
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.800]  I you know, this is why people would ask me why doesn't why doesn't apple buy
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.960]  by uh nokia's here and I you know, I would say well look it's up for sale for three billion dollars and then there's like
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.400]  There's no deal yet
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:46.800]  but but somebody supposedly is bidding three billion dollars on something that a few years ago cost seven billion dollars and suddenly we're saying is
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.480]  Absolutely a hygiene factor as far as platforms are concerned if you don't have this
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.880]  You're you're you're you're a non-player and apple is desperate and so on and so on all of these things
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.760]  Make no sense when you look at the when you follow the money and you say here's somebody could just buy the third
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:05.520]  best apples, you know, the third best mapping system and probably
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:13.520]  You know having the longest legacy actually, uh, and no one wants it. Why is that why these things don't make sense?
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:19.840]  To to you know, when you reconcile the dollars and you reconcile against the supposed value
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:27.360]  and in in uh in that what is it the the invaluable nature of maps as a strategic asset and so
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:34.320]  I I I point out that well the guys who are in it already have already decided and committed to this strategy and they're putting their
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.360]  Own people to work on it and this would not help them very much
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.760]  So the only question is would there be a third party that wants to get into this business?
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.640]  But they have to discover a business and they have to work on it. So the only question is would there be a third party?
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.320]  That wants to get into this business, but they have to discover a business model
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:55.680]  That's the question if uber and uber is one of the candidates that's being put forward
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.040]  Maybe it's it's not true
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:02.960]  But I the rumors say that uber is interested or the car makers as a group would go and buy
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.360]  This mapping thing that's up for grabs
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.240]  But they would have to come up with how do we make sure we're profitable to burning to?
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.120]  Up to a two billion dollars a year to keep the service
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.120]  Uh
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.300]  Competitive
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:22.100]  And and and the answer would have to be that they have to get into some way of monetizing
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:26.580]  Autonomies autonomous vehicles and and I both have an interest in that
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:34.100]  Yeah, because it kills it can kill a bunch of birds and maybe more than two birds with one stone where the autonomous vehicles
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:40.100]  And you see, you know, it's no secret that that uber is getting into package delivery
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.860]  Um and stuff like that and that amazon, you know
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:49.160]  It's it's a whole bunch of different companies are converging on the same idea and that amazon is investigating
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:23:55.220]  New ways to deliver packages to people that without going through ups
[01:23:56.180 --> 01:24:00.100]  Or something like that. I actually had an uncomfortable conversation with my ups guy the other day
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:02.420]  where uh
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.140]  There was a package from amazon that was left at our door
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:11.540]  And then the ups guy came and rang the doorbell and had another one and that's very unlike ups ups
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.140]  It's usually very very efficient at bundling two things
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.500]  You know if you have two different orders coming that they come in at one time
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.100]  uh
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.100]  And you know and he mentioned you know that
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.980]  He said he thought I wasn't home because that other you know
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.580]  That amazon package had already been left there by somebody else at my front door
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:35.060]  Uh clearly not delivered by ups. But anyway, all these things people getting driven around and not owning cars
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:39.220]  This whole idea that if you live in an urban environment you you can use uber
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:42.420]  Instead of owning a car and you actually save money
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:47.060]  You can save a lot of money compared to the the monthly cost of owning a car
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:52.020]  And combine that with the fact that these cars could do
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:56.980]  The work of taking the pictures and stuff like that as they drive around the area
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:03.140]  Oh, yeah, and that's the thing. And in fact, uh, this professor at nyu. Galloway, um, skye galloway
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.780]  Yeah, great, you know, he great guy and he you should probably interview him. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:09.620]  Yeah, he's on my list of knowledge
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:10.820]  and if you know
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:18.740]  he he points out that that uber is potentially disruptive to to amazon because when you break amazon down besides having a discovery engine for
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.960]  You know through the website, it's really a massive operations
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:29.240]  And distribution center. In fact, that's where a lot of their money goes there a lot of their their capex or capital expenses are in
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:35.160]  Setting up distribution centers globally and they're very expensive and they're somewhat even robotic
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.480]  They have robots and stuff in in in them. And so that's a that's a that's a high cost thing
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.560]  And they're doing it because really that's that's how they get the growth thing, you know
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.960]  They have to get these packages, uh in in to to from a lot of points to a lot of points
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.160]  And the thing is that that's exactly what uber does now
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:26:01.320]  It doesn't have the storefront but it's actually probably easier for them to do a storefront then then. Uh,
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.840]  then
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:08.040]  Then it would be to build the infrastructure that that they're disrupting. So it's it's it's fascinating
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:11.240]  I think uber is one of the most disruptive ideas ever. Um,
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.520]  And and so that's why you know, they would come to the maps question with a different set of priorities
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.880]  Not so much about monetizing them the way the other two are doing it
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:23.720]  But rather than saying hey, you know, this is actually exactly in the direction. We want to go
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:28.760]  We want to be a logistics company. We want to be a transportation company. We want to be a
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:35.240]  Potential even a vehicle company and so and so all of that and the maps enables that
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:39.640]  And of course the cost of that, uh, you know, uh, you know, uh, you know, uh,
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:44.280]  It enables that and of course the car makers are in, you know, are in it for the same obvious
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.560]  reasons that they've always been yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me intuitively that
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.360]  If somebody else we're gonna start, you know, like let's just say uber to be a third major maps company
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  um that they would have
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.640]  a third different
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:09.240]  Revenue model, right? So there's google that's doing it with advertising and just sort of we'll put our maps anywhere and everywhere we can
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.520]  And get the most people we possibly can and we're going to make
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:18.440]  That money back by advertising and we really only need to sell a few dollars in ads per user per year to make this
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:25.560]  To make this work. There's the apple model, which is we're going to use this as a value add to our premium products
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.320]  And I don't feel like anybody is going to catch google or apple in either of those ways soon
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.840]  And so it makes sense to me that if somebody's going to be a strong number three
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:42.280]  That it would be with an entirely different model like uber. Yeah, and that's where i'm saying by the title is like where maps are going
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.360]  is where
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.040]  where you know in in the sense of
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.760]  obtaining value from transportation by the way
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:54.200]  It's possible that both apple and google also have that in mind because they're going to potentially enable vehicles
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:28:00.760]  Either of their own design or licensing it for that and and uh and the other thing that I found
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.800]  Fascinating and I don't remember where I read it, but it was a wonderful expose which said that
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.320]  Really the key to to the autonomous vehicle the self-driving cars that google is
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:17.320]  Is now field testing is not that they have this amazing algorithm that it recognizes the world
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.600]  And is able to act as if we do in terms of
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:28.360]  of avoiding, avoiding an accident, but rather that they compare what they see with what is stored
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.000]  And what is stored is essentially hyper
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:33.640]  high-resolution
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:39.000]  Map of the street. So imagine that the vehicles drive over the same spot many times
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.800]  they always take a picture and then they upload it and that is what's stored as the
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:49.880]  This is the world the way it looks now compare what that the way the world looks with the vehicles
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:54.780]  looks with what you are seeing at this moment if they don't match then there's an obstacle
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:29:01.640]  So that's the way they determine whether there's an obstacle in the way because there is this kind of uh, uh comparison being done
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.040]  Rather than saying. Oh, I see this blob
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:10.440]  I'm going to use my artificial intelligence to determine if the blob is a person or an animal or you know, uh, uh,
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.800]  Boulder, it's really about this kind of
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.580]  Differential they they're able to do is it's really much more brute force than than than we think
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.820]  And probably more effective by the way in less error-prone
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:28.060]  Than than than uh than this idea of really machine learning
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:35.260]  About driving and and so it's very data-driven and that the boils it boils down to therefore really having
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:39.100]  Super high hyper accurate maps like down to the centimeter
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:45.420]  In terms of resolution rather than what we see now, which is down to the meter. Uh, and and and also
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:52.700]  Not just street view imagine street view with the ability to just to to see every cent every square centimeter
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.380]  Of the world as you're moving along at 60 frames a second
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:02.940]  And and so you're doing that comparison continuously and therefore you're able to uh, really have that autonomous
[01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:09.260]  Machine and and this is why also it's very difficult to the the the one of the side effects is that the unless you have
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.780]  A map of the inside of a of a let's say an inside of a parking garage
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:19.600]  That this the car cannot go there the car can only go in places that have been pre-mapped and pre-visualized
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:23.980]  And so that's why maps are so important to autonomous vehicles
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:28.700]  It's because the algorithms depend on having a very hyper accurate view of the world
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.020]  And so if either if either three of these three contenders, right?
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:40.540]  Google, uh, apple and uber who want to want to become uh, potentially again, there's a lot of hypothesis here
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:48.460]  Potentially suppliers of information or transportation services then you get into this whole question. How good are your maps?
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.700]  They have to control the maps and in fact maps are not good enough
[01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:56.620]  So they can't just go. Oh, well, we'll just we'll just get somebody to do it for us
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.300]  We'll just get somebody to do it for us. No, we're gonna have to figure this out
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:06.460]  So so that's why I think part of these vans you see that apple drives around and we think of them as being well
[01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.300]  They're just doing street view
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:13.180]  Well street view is the is the baby version of what what's going to be necessary if you're going to have autonomous vehicles
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.700]  That's a great point. Let's keep going on this
[01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:20.460]  But before we do I want to thank our third and final sponsor and it's our good friends at casper
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.620]  casper
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:27.500]  Makes obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair prices
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.260]  Just the right sink just the right bounce
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.980]  They combine two technologies, uh to make one mattress
[01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:40.460]  You don't have to go there and pick like oh do you want mattress a or mattress b mattress c?
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:48.540]  You just pick a size and all their mattresses have the same exact feel to them using two technologies latex foam and memory foam
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:55.660]  Uh put together with just the right mix of how much of each style to make a perfect mattress
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:57.660]  uh now
[01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:58.780]  again
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.500]  Buying a mattress all this stuff you can buy online sounds crazy
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.380]  Well, why in the world would you buy a mattress online if you can't feel it?
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:06.780]  I can't try it
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:14.380]  Uh, here's the thing. They have a risk free trial and return policy you try sleeping on a casper for a hundred days
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:19.900]  And that's with free delivery and painless free return. So 99 days into it. You don't like it
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.780]  You think this is this is not a this was not a good mattress
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:28.780]  You just go to their website and say, you know set up a thing. They'll come pick up the mattress take it out of there
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:36.140]  That's how confident though they are in the mattress now when they first started sponsoring a show I forget what the
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:42.940]  free trial period was but it was less than 100 days and they extended it to 100 days because that they've
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:46.220]  Had so few returns because people buy these mattresses and love them
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:50.220]  Their mattresses are made in america
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.740]  And the prices if you've ever if you shop for a mattress recently, you'll see just how low these prices are
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.540]  500 for a twin size mattress
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:06.780]  Up to 950 for a king size mattress. So under a thousand dollars for a king size mattress unheard of for a premium mattress
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:10.380]  Compare that to the industry averages and it's just outstanding
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:16.400]  Uh, how did they deliver them? It's this is part of the amazing part of this is is that by using these foam technologies?
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:22.460]  Latex foam and memory foam they can vacuum seal these mattresses into a shockingly small box
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:27.020]  It's a big box to get delivered. It's probably the biggest package you'll get, you know, if you order one of these
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:29.020]  It's probably the biggest package you'll get all year
[01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:34.140]  But it's way smaller than the size of a mattress and so they have instructions on the box
[01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:37.420]  Uh, they tell you take it to the room and get it out of the box
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:41.740]  The instructions on the box, uh, they tell you take it to the room where you want to have it
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.060]  Take it to your bedroom and open the box there
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:48.060]  You definitely don't want to open it downstairs and then carry it upstairs because then you're stuck
[01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:53.660]  lugging a mattress size thing you open it up and it makes a cool sound as it soaks in the air and
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:59.980]  Next thing, you know, you've got a full-size mattress, uh, really really good stuff. I've got one. It's really nice
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:01.660]  It's a great mattress
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.140]  Could not be more convenient. I just found out I did not know this. I don't live in new york
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:11.500]  They've got a thing where if you live in new york city, you can get one same day. I believe
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:16.780]  And they actually deliver them. This is how small the boxes are. They get delivered by people on uh bicycles
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:23.740]  That it's so it's a big thing to lug on your back on a bike, but it actually is that that convenient to uh ship around
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:32.000]  So here's the thing you can't lose you don't have to go to six different mattress stores and try six different mattresses
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.820]  And figure out which ones are equivalent between the two and price shop. Just go to casper.com
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.720]  The talk show casper casp. Er dot com slash
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:46.320]  The talk show figure out what size mattress you want
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.720]  And order it
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:54.720]  That's it. Now use that code the talk show. I think it kicks in as long as you just use the url
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.880]  But if you need the code, it's the talk show and you save an additional
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.400]  50 bucks off the price of any mattress
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.440]  So save 50 bucks
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.120]  they'll know you came from the show and you'll get a great mattress at a
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.040]  Truly unbeatable price casper.com slash the talk show
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:18.640]  So we're talking about maps. I'm not sure if we have more to go on maps. But uh
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.520]  It it has occurred to me. One thing i've looked at as i've been thinking about it more and more is that
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.680]  I i'm slow to the uptake sometimes on on revolutionary companies
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.040]  And uber is one of them where uber is a company where?
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.880]  I've been using them for a while ever since especially since they came to philadelphia, but they've always been you know
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:44.400]  They started in san francisco and san francisco has well, it's gotten better and it's because of uber
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.480]  But san francisco to me has always had some of the worst taxicab service of any any city that I visit
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.200]  It's simply appalling compared to what i'm used to on the east coast
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.360]  And so I was a big fan of uber in san francisco right from the get-go
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.480]  But I just I thought of them simply as
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:11.200]  A newfangled taxi company and that's it and I didn't look past that and it's it occurred to me that that's exactly how I used
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:17.120]  To see amazon. I was a very early adopter of amazon for buying books, but I saw them as a bookstore
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.680]  And then people would say oh amazon has ambitions to do a lot more than just books and I would just roll my eyes and think
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.320]  Whatever, but it's a pretty it is a pretty cool bookstore
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:34.640]  I thought the same thing about uber until recently but I see now that I think that they they sort of are like the inverse of amazon
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.720]  Indeed and you know what what's interesting when you think about trying to do this type of
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.800]  Analysis of we're thinking, you know, I always use some kind of you know biological metaphor like I say, you know
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.960]  It's it's like it's like looking at a baby
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.040]  and saying
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.360]  That's pretty useless human being you know
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.440]  It's just like can't do anything. It's like
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.320]  This is a lot of the criticisms we get when not just when new companies are born
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.960]  But even when new products are born from established companies and we're we're just like
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:15.280]  It's it's useless, you know, like the apple watch or the first iphone or the first whatever. I mean, yeah
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:20.000]  some things apple does were much more meaningful, but it's like the the logic of it is that
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.160]  the the the
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.720]  writers say the magic of it is being able to look in the child's eyes and say that there lies, you know,
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:31.120]  A human being that's going to live 90 years
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.400]  That's going to have an amazing life that's going to change the world and contribute to the world
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.840]  That's going to change the world and contribute so much to others
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:44.400]  and and and and and and and yet and yet
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.120]  That's not what comes in the mind even of the parent
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.880]  the the the stranger may just be ambivalent or you know a lot of young people who haven't
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.760]  You know, you you remember when you were when you were a teenager, you didn't think babies were all that great
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.600]  But when you're when you're parent age, you kind of really get a soft spot and then when it's your kid
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:09.760]  You're you're you're you're you're completely irrational about children. But but the point i'm making is that
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.720]  We don't love children because of what they're gonna
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.840]  Be necessarily we don't love our children because they're gonna grow up to be
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.560]  Lawyers and doctors or that they're gonna help us in our old age
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.080]  We love them because it's just we love them and and the thing is that
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.360]  That um, there's this this i'd like to
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:37.760]  Propose that we treat um startups and and and and young things in general with the same
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.200]  The
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.680]  Contemplation of their potential but also sort of saying well, they're valuable just because they exist, you know
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:49.440]  They're just valuable because somebody
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.280]  took the effort of making it and and
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:58.560]  And and and and you know, that's worth a lot and um, you know, it's coming back to
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.760]  Pixar again remember in in ratatouille and that speech of
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.320]  What was the name of the the the critic
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.880]  At the end he said, you know
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.760]  Not nothing we do as critics is worth
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.760]  The crummiest product we've ever visited or the crummiest restaurant we've ever eaten that
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:24.560]  Because these people work to make it happen and all we do is
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.240]  Consume the result and and and mock it
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.200]  So we don't you know, they deserve a lot more that we do
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.800]  but he said, you know the value of the critic he continues is in discovering the new and
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.880]  that's that that was a beautiful speech and
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:46.560]  I wish I really did
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:52.960]  I wish I would remember who wrote it but it was almost as if they were speaking to the character's name was Anton Ego
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.240]  Portrayed that's Peter. Oh, I remember that hitting home for me too, because
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.920]  I
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:06.480]  Clearly was self-aware enough to recognize that that's more or less the career that I've carved out for myself
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.840]  Is you know effectively I'm a critic
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.360]  a
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:14.320]  Pundit on these things and that I do a lot more
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  And that I do a lot more
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:24.000]  Telling tell, you know thinking about whether the work of other people is good or bad or how it could be improved
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:26.080]  Then I do creating it myself
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.800]  and that you know, I should remember that and keep that perspective and not
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.240]  Never lose sight of the fact that what I say is not more important than the actual work itself
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.440]  Yeah
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.320]  having said that so I you know, I want to make sure that we give we give a lot of
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.640]  Credit to those who stick their necks out
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:52.160]  But it's it's also important that when you when you look at something and you ask yourself, what can it become?
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.120]  That there are helpful hints. Um
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:59.680]  One thing you can study with a baby is they could study its parents often
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.480]  That's a great indicator of what they're going to end up doing or how how well not always I mean
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:08.400]  Maybe even if you have 20 chance, uh, it's better than zero though
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:15.200]  Uh, so so there's there's that and also sometimes you study the child and you see how whether they struggled through life
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:18.080]  Uh, and that usually tells you that they will do
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:21.760]  Better than average because they they actually are learning
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:29.440]  Through experience and and so when you see something like an uber, uh, you know
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:33.360]  You measure things like are they flexible? Are they driven? Are they?
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.160]  Are they do they have an ambition?
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.000]  an ambition
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.880]  And fundamentally, I think the disruptive theory that i've i'm a big fan of and i'm i'm a big
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:50.640]  uh supporter and advocate of is that it gives you these hints about
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.040]  where things can go and the thinking of around, uh,
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:58.240]  the analysis around an object like uber is that
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.920]  You know, they're solving a job and that is to get people from point to point and that job
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.980]  Today has an alternative called a car and it's really about understanding
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.080]  The substitution power that they have versus something that doesn't necessarily
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.640]  Is not seen in the same category and this is when
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:24.000]  When you start to jump across markets and you have to cross categories and say, you know
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.400]  Actually, this thing has the potential to be a threat to something that's completely unrelated and that's that that
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.120]  skill of
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.120]  Understanding what it's really
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.440]  What what it's really trying to do and what the customer we use the phrase what what the customer hires the product to do
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.160]  And this is in a way of saying, uh, uh, this is the jobs to be done
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:50.960]  Methodologies like saying well you don't buy a drill you buy a hole in the wall
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:58.640]  and so if if and and and this has been an observation for many many decades ago that that which companies sell isn't what
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:05.940]  What their buyers or their customers are buying so this distinction is important because those the capabilities
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.880]  that the that the seller have
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:15.360]  The has the the capability that they say well we can make this but then the other person on the other side
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:20.800]  Who receives the product is saying well what I really need is something else, but thanks. I'll take this and I'll make it work
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.000]  That's where the combination of those two things plus the opportunity to to
[01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:33.120]  Shake hands and change money. That's how we make business and so often these these are separate things too many times
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.560]  We we end up in a situation where we buy a product not exactly what we want
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.560]  but
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.880]  But then but then you ask yourself
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:46.720]  But that product can evolve and get better because it's getting information from the from the buyer about what's wrong with it
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.760]  And then and then you know, they get pricing signals, you know, they sounds very very
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:58.240]  Very much like a buzzword, but the idea is simply that look I can't charge much for this thing like today. I can't charge
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:05.280]  $400 for for office anymore and that's a signal to Microsoft to say go do something else
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.240]  And and if you don't have that signal you just keep doing it
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:12.720]  So so if you sell to enterprises who are like, oh whatever I'll keep paying
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:18.800]  Then then you you you you you you get dumber you get dumber and not not not move on and so if you have
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.200]  Consumer as a customer then they're going to eventually say i'm not going to pay that anymore
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.280]  I'm going to go off and buy a tablet that does good enough work instead of a pc, etc
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:32.320]  Etc. And so and so that this is that this is why the conversation happens with the customer. So
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.800]  Anyway, there's a lot of these things we we can we can talk about but the bottom line is that and when I think about an
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.920]  Uber I always think about well
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:42.960]  Why are they really hired to do and I think what they're hired to do is saying?
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:45.840]  I want a car outside my door when I whenever i'm ready to go
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:50.800]  Uh, and and if I have that that uh option
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.840]  Every time every day everywhere
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.920]  Then I don't need a car anymore and that means I can get rid of my car
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:02.960]  And if if I can do a deal with uber and say hey guys, I don't want to pay pay for this trip
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.760]  Every every time I get in the car, but can I just pay up front three hundred dollars and you guys always show up?
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.880]  And uber works it out and says
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.640]  Okay, you know they probably will have some customers that will use it less and some customers that will use it more but on average
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.120]  maybe three hundred dollars a month is a good price to offer it as a as a as a
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:28.000]  All-you-can-eat uber then suddenly that you know, you'll have like amazon amazon
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:34.480]  Prime and so you you'll be saying, you know, I want uber prime. So uber prime is a 350 a month
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:36.960]  Maybe in the beginning they're gonna charge five hundred dollars a month
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:44.160]  Because some people will pay that and probably they'll have fewer uh fewer, uh, sparse users, etc, etc
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.520]  So over time that's going to change. But anyway, they'll do that and someday, you know
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.400]  And then what and then so uber is putting in pulling in all this money five hundred dollars and they're saying
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.440]  And then they have to turn around and hire people to to serve as chauffeurs or or whatever
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:02.800]  And and they'll say, uh, you know, maybe we we ought to finance their car price
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:07.120]  Buying, maybe we ought to put them on the payroll. Maybe we're gonna
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:14.960]  Get some autonomous vehicles. We'll have better algorithms for dispatch because we'll know where these people live, etc, etc, etc
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.280]  So a lot of these things are going to be information driven and at that point though the you know
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.760]  The the machine just takes over and it just goes goes and goes rolling and rolling and and as far as the entrepreneur is concerned
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:29.200]  At every stage of that journey, they're just following in on the same thing
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:34.480]  They're saying well, obviously we got to do this, right? Uh, people are asking for it or hey
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.200]  I just some guy, you know intern runs in the room and say hey, but we thought of doing this
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.080]  This makes a lot of sense
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:46.240]  I just ran these numbers look at this and so they'll do it without any kind of great strategy or any kind of big vision
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:53.520]  Or any mckinsey consultant telling them that's what the future is going to be. So they'll do it intuitively and and lo and behold
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:59.680]  10 years later, they'll they'll they'll have
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.200]  Millions of customers paying them billions of dollars a year to provide
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.040]  transportation services and all those millions of customers will have abandoned owning a car and
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:17.440]  Uber will be commissioning more Priuses than anybody else on the planet probably, you know enough to fill a factory
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:22.320]  With production so if they in that case, why shouldn't uber just make its own car?
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:28.640]  And maybe well, maybe it won't maybe I'll just simply do a great deal with Toyota and and Toyota will essentially be
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.200]  having one giant customer
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:37.520]  Or you know versus millions of small ones and and so maybe that deal will work for the both of them
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:42.240]  But maybe not maybe that you know uber uber will say, you know prices in the best configuration
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.600]  We can do a lot better if we if we've made our own design and then they'll hire the best designer out of gm
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:53.680]  Or toyota or bmw and they'll say we go to it. And by the way, we've got manufacturing guys who can help as well
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.240]  And on it goes right? So this is why you go from a baby to a mature adult that suddenly is
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:06.480]  Well, that's the thing that's occurred to me and I realize that it's very different if you live in a relatively or or like I live
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.800]  In a real urban environment. I've been Center City, Philadelphia
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.520]  I go to New York a lot. I go to San Francisco a lot
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.080]  But if you live anywhere, it's even relatively uber where uber can be a practical service
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.640]  I mean, obviously there's in especially in the United States
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:24.320]  There's many people who live in rural areas where uber isn't going to make sense or at least isn't going to make sense for a long time
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.760]  But it just take a look at a typical city
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:34.400]  Where are most of the cars by far and away most of the cars at any moment in any city are parked?
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.520]  right, which is incredibly inefficient and
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:43.440]  It's an enormous part of the pain in the ass of owning a car or even visiting a city with a car
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.440]  Is the pain of parking?
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:54.000]  Yep, so I but I can but that's actually good for the auto industry where there's a lot more cars being sold
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.680]  than there are cars being driven at any moment and the disruption of uber is
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.040]  Let's keep these cars moving and it's almost like the airline
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:08.240]  metaphor, you know and you hear that like one of the reasons that Southwest is is
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.040]  More successful than most other airlines is that the employees buy into the mantra?
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.480]  You can't make money with planes that aren't in the air and that's why they their Southwest has
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.360]  you know significantly
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:23.440]  like like
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.440]  It contributes to their profitability that they there take that takes them less time to
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.320]  Disembark and embark on a flight and they keep most of their planes in the air
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:41.760]  Well an uber car that isn't being driven isn't making money and but that if people stop buying cars and just leaving them in
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.760]  Their garage parked all night
[01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:49.760]  I don't know that that could to me be terribly disruptive to the auto industry in terms of the number of cars being bought
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.040]  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes indeed. And that's see the dream that you have of
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.560]  better utilization of cars is exactly also google's dream when it came to
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:06.640]  You know to to their motivation for driverless cars because they they but here's the interesting thing
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:09.440]  This is where the theory comes into play again. Is that let's say
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:16.800]  You follow the logic of google and their their algorithmic approach to to autonomy
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.360]  And then you follow uber's logic and you ask here's a good question. Let's say you see both of them pointing in the direction of
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.120]  of
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:26.000]  the
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.200]  the
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.880]  you know sort of depopulating cities with with automobiles and and and increasing utilization of
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:34.720]  automobiles
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:41.200]  And so who wins because this is where the where you have to have another way of thinking and theorizing about it because
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:43.680]  The problem I think is that
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:48.160]  In the case of google, they're just saying we understand where we're going
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.880]  we're going to get there through a process of of of research and
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:51:00.400]  We're gonna we're gonna ship. Uh, uh, the product when it's ready and that's where where I think that's kind of a deliberate approach
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.240]  Where it's uber it's just gonna follow its nose and go down that path and maybe it'll get there
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.480]  Maybe it won't but all the time it does it it learns and all the time it does it it's profitable
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.040]  And so if that's the my my bet would be that uber will get there faster
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.600]  So that's that's that's how I would I would analyze that but it's it's a great story. It's a wonderful
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.160]  Do you think you would be able to do that?
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:26.480]  It's a great story. It's a wonderful. Do you think here's my question about uber is how does uber?
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.280]  protect their lead
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:30.800]  What keeps?
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:35.840]  Other companies from saying oh I see what they're doing. Let's all do that too. And then all of a sudden
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:37.280]  the
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.580]  The whole idea of anything you could use uber for is commoditized
[01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.200]  Some of it is just plain
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:48.880]  Just plain running as fast as you can. So one thing obviously is that they're
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:55.280]  They're they're recruiting drivers as quickly as possible. They're they're recruiting users as quickly as possible
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:58.240]  Establishing as many cities as possible
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:04.960]  So they're running essentially in the land grab scenario where you you identify the resources that you need drivers cars
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:11.280]  Passengers and and regulation and you just like sweeping the land with that
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.720]  And then you you assume there's a first mover advantage
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:17.120]  Of course others can come in but you realize it's heavy lifting
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:19.920]  Similarly, you could have said well why you know when google
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:25.120]  Stumbled upon search as the answer. Why didn't everybody else? I mean, yes their algorithms were better
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.800]  But there were other search engines and partly was like google doubled and tripled and quadrupled down on on servers
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:36.560]  And on infrastructure and that was basically that was their that was their secret sauce. It was brute force
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:40.880]  It was just running really fast. And so in the early years that's and they were obsessed and
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:48.640]  Obsessively focused on response times like like to a degree like where other search engines were measuring response times in seconds
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:53.120]  and google was already measuring in tenths of a second and and
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:59.280]  Right, and so experience was important and but but ultimately it was like they did the heavy, you know
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.640]  They designed their own data centers
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:05.440]  They designed their own servers at a time when all of those things you could buy and even even rent
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:11.520]  And and so why did they need to go so deep in the guts of their of their operations because they realized that the thing
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.840]  That they needed to tweak the most was that performance metric and the scaling metric
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:23.760]  And so that let them essentially run like wildfire and capture share and again same thing with microsoft by the way and others who came before
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:25.920]  It's this this driving
[01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:30.480]  Driving force that you're just gonna go as fast as you can because you know, you know where you're going, you know
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.800]  You know what you're doing and the other guys are just not sure what they're doing
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:41.440]  Not sure if that's worth committing how many billions, you know, and especially the big guys. They're like, I don't get this. Yeah, I
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:45.840]  thought I had about it was sort of the way that as long as they
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.680]  as a lot, you know, the the first mover advantage is
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:56.880]  Is real but you have to kind of stay focused on still being the best even if it's in small ways
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:00.000]  and I the thing that made me think about it was a tweet from
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.960]  Our friend the guy who stole my shirt ben thompson this week where he he mentioned that he was in san francisco
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.960]  obviously for wwdc2
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.400]  and
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.000]  had a couple of
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:18.400]  Coupons or codes or something to get free rides in lift and he had been meaning to try it
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.600]  He'd never tried the service and here he'd gone back home to
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:28.480]  Taipei and forgot to use them and had taken an uber every time he got in a car in san francisco simply out of habit
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.560]  Simply out of habit and that the habits matter that without even thinking about it
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:36.000]  He'd forgotten to try lift even though he was going to be able to try it for free
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:41.760]  And to me that just speaks to the power of the first mover advantage
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:49.200]  Yeah power of first mover power of defaults power of of being the go-to thing that people hire right away
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.160]  And so there is something but that's again that's earned. It's not something that that
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:57.360]  You can get to before you actually do great work
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:04.480]  It has it comes as a as a byproduct of building the brand and building the experience and all those other things
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.600]  So knowing to focus on the right thing at the right time
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.680]  Knowing to put all the chips on the table when you know, you have a good hand
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:15.280]  That's really at first of course you got to get the chips

[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:26.800]  That is able to to parlay every advantage into another one and then bet again and again and again
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:33.280]  Doubling down every time and shifting their strategy all along the way and pivoting as they call it these days
