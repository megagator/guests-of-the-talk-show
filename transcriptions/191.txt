[00:00.000 --> 00:01.800]  Jim, where are you John?
[00:02.400 --> 00:03.100]  I'm pretty good.
[00:06.600 --> 00:08.900]  It's just had a long pre show talk about.
[00:11.300 --> 00:14.440]  But yeah, in the context of the show, let's just say that's just
[00:14.440 --> 00:15.700]  summarize it all is it's good.
[00:15.800 --> 00:19.100]  Yes, it's um, I have to take you to task for something.
[00:19.500 --> 00:20.300]  Alright, please do.
[00:20.400 --> 00:23.000]  Has anybody ever done that first thing like right off the bat?
[00:23.100 --> 00:23.800]  I don't know.
[00:25.000 --> 00:26.000]  Well, they should.
[00:26.100 --> 00:27.100]  Okay, well, I'm going to.
[00:27.100 --> 00:31.400]  No, the correct answer is Sean Connery.
[00:31.800 --> 00:34.100]  Always always Sean Connery.
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  I would have thought I would have thought that you might be a
[00:37.100 --> 00:39.100]  Roger Moore man Sean Connery.
[00:39.300 --> 00:43.300]  Well, I mean, I would if you ask me who my favorite Bond is, I
[00:43.300 --> 00:48.500]  would still say Sean Connery and and his Bond movies altogether
[00:48.500 --> 00:53.300]  are my favorite favorites and from Russia with love in particular
[00:53.300 --> 00:59.300]  would be my answer to my favorite Bond movie but I I have a soft
[00:59.300 --> 01:05.400]  spot for Roger Moore and I like Daniel Craig as well and I that
[01:05.400 --> 01:07.400]  I like Pierce Brosnan in a role.
[01:07.400 --> 01:10.600]  I just feel like the producers let those movies sort of get away
[01:10.600 --> 01:14.600]  and and they made they made bad movies with a good actor for
[01:14.600 --> 01:15.100]  Bond.
[01:15.100 --> 01:19.700]  Yeah, I agree with that but anytime you know what I think it
[01:19.700 --> 01:20.900]  is to be honest.
[01:20.900 --> 01:23.200]  My father didn't like Roger Moore.
[01:23.500 --> 01:28.200]  Yeah, my dad did not either and and I think that's probably the
[01:28.200 --> 01:31.500]  reason you know, you grow up with that and I think that was
[01:31.500 --> 01:35.900]  probably it but as an adult, I just love everything Sean Connery
[01:35.900 --> 01:39.200]  does and I could sit and listen to him talk, you know, just
[01:39.200 --> 01:39.900]  forever.
[01:40.400 --> 01:45.000]  Yeah, so well as a kid who was born in the early 70s for me, it
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.200]  was very very I think you even now in hindsight right now in
[01:49.200 --> 01:53.000]  2017, you can look back and you can see that the Connery Bond
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  movies look like the 60s and the more ones look like the 70s.
[02:00.100 --> 02:04.000]  But to me as a kid in the late 70s when I first started watching
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.500]  them it it was the difference between these look fresh like
[02:09.500 --> 02:14.000]  these look like new movies and the Connery ones look old and
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.500]  old as a kid is just never a good thing and I liked you know,
[02:18.500 --> 02:21.100]  I think they were actually were in some ways.
[02:21.100 --> 02:21.900]  I think part of it too.
[02:21.900 --> 02:24.600]  Is that the Roger Moore movies were a little bit more meant
[02:24.600 --> 02:28.900]  for kids, you know that the I think so I think that the emphasis
[02:28.900 --> 02:34.100]  on stunts and and some of the silliness, you know, the you
[02:34.100 --> 02:35.600]  know, there were more gags.
[02:35.600 --> 02:38.100]  It wasn't just you know, I think the only real funny things
[02:38.100 --> 02:40.500]  in the Connery ones were when Connery would just say something
[02:40.500 --> 02:43.600]  funny which is great.
[02:43.600 --> 02:48.900]  We'll just let Sean talk but like in the Roger Moore one
[02:48.900 --> 02:53.500]  so for example, and if you look at I know that back in the
[02:53.500 --> 02:56.100]  day when when Dan Benjamin and I did the thing on the show
[02:56.100 --> 02:59.200]  where we ran through each at the end of every episode for
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.400]  23 episodes in a row.
[03:01.400 --> 03:05.900]  We review one of the Bond movies in order and when you watch
[03:05.900 --> 03:08.700]  him in order you pick things up that you don't see otherwise
[03:08.700 --> 03:12.500]  like during the Moore era there was a running gag between
[03:12.500 --> 03:14.200]  the movies where there was the same guy.
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.000]  I forget who he was.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.700]  He was like a producer or something like that.
[03:16.700 --> 03:19.800]  But one of the producers of the movie would make a cameo
[03:19.800 --> 03:24.000]  in a in a scene and something crazy would happen.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.900]  We're like Bond would shoot down the ski slopes and burst
[03:28.900 --> 03:31.500]  right through a building through the wall and then there's
[03:31.500 --> 03:36.600]  the guy you know what I mean?
[03:36.600 --> 03:39.000]  And he just looks he just looks at his glass of wine.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.800]  Like am I drunk or did that just happen and it and the best
[03:41.800 --> 03:44.200]  one is I think it actually is pretty funny.
[03:44.200 --> 03:48.100]  It's it's in The Spy Who Loves Me and and Bond is driving
[03:48.100 --> 03:53.600]  the Lotus submarine car and comes out of the ocean on a
[03:53.600 --> 03:57.900]  beach full of you know, sunbathers and he drives right
[03:57.900 --> 04:01.100]  out of the ocean and there's the guy with a glass of wine
[04:01.100 --> 04:03.200]  on the beach and he just looks at the glass of wine.
[04:03.200 --> 04:04.900]  Like Jesus Christ.
[04:04.900 --> 04:08.800]  Am I fucked up or did I just see a car drive out of the
[04:08.800 --> 04:11.500]  ocean? I love that.
[04:11.500 --> 04:12.300]  That's great.
[04:12.300 --> 04:14.700]  Yeah, and you know, and that's the sort of thing that just
[04:14.700 --> 04:17.500]  it would have been it would have never worked in the Connery
[04:17.500 --> 04:19.900]  movies, you know, and I think it's you know, it's obviously
[04:19.900 --> 04:23.500]  a little childish to have a submarine car that drives out
[04:23.500 --> 04:26.500]  of the ocean onto a beach.
[04:26.500 --> 04:31.700]  Well, Connery was the best but more I think you got to give
[04:31.700 --> 04:34.000]  him credit and I really do think you have to give him credit
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.300]  because what he did was he in no way shaped.
[04:36.300 --> 04:39.100]  He was he was totally comfortable with not being as good
[04:39.100 --> 04:44.300]  as Connery like you know what I mean, like he he didn't try
[04:44.300 --> 04:45.200]  to be Sean Connery.
[04:45.200 --> 04:47.100]  He didn't try to outdo Sean Connery.
[04:47.100 --> 04:51.100]  He just was himself and he was very very comfortable as
[04:51.100 --> 04:52.900]  Roger Moore's James Bond.
[04:52.900 --> 04:56.100]  That's a good point and that is a good point.
[04:56.100 --> 05:01.300]  You wouldn't want somebody coming in trying to be the guy
[05:01.300 --> 05:05.700]  before him, you know, he did make it his own and I think
[05:05.700 --> 05:08.300]  that that's what turned it into this franchise that can
[05:08.300 --> 05:14.300]  span 40 50 years and is ongoing is it more made it possible
[05:14.300 --> 05:18.400]  for them to do three or four or five pictures with an actor
[05:18.400 --> 05:23.400]  in the role and then not really reboot it but sort of semi
[05:23.400 --> 05:26.400]  reboot it, you know, and the more one in particular they
[05:26.400 --> 05:28.800]  didn't recast any of the other roles the same guy played
[05:28.800 --> 05:31.800]  M the same guy played Q the same woman played many money
[05:31.800 --> 05:34.200]  penny, but he was not the same guy.
[05:34.200 --> 05:37.100]  He was James Bond, but he was not the same James Bond and
[05:37.100 --> 05:42.900]  he somehow made it work and it it turned it into a different
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.100]  kind of franchise.
[05:44.100 --> 05:46.100]  Well, he was the longest-running one, right?
[05:46.100 --> 05:46.900]  Yeah, definitely.
[05:46.900 --> 05:52.700]  Yeah, he made six movies and it spans 1972.
[05:52.700 --> 05:59.100]  I think was when it was either 72 or 73 when Live and Let
[05:59.100 --> 06:03.100]  Die came out that was his first one and then he did man
[06:03.100 --> 06:05.900]  with the Golden Gun which was his worst one and one of the
[06:05.900 --> 06:07.100]  worst Bond movies ever made.
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.900]  I mean, he ends up fighting a midget at the end.
[06:14.300 --> 06:16.900]  Okay, we can just end the podcast right now.
[06:16.900 --> 06:21.100]  What a note to end it on right there then then came his
[06:21.100 --> 06:22.500]  best movie The Spy Who Loved Me.
[06:22.500 --> 06:26.900]  Yeah, then came Moonraker, which I think when Dan and I
[06:26.900 --> 06:30.000]  reviewed them I sort of poo-pooed because of all the silly
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  space stuff at the end, but I've since come around and
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.100]  especially the up until the space stuff.
[06:36.100 --> 06:40.800]  It's a really solid Roger Moore Bond movie then came this
[06:40.800 --> 06:41.600]  is all off the top of my head.
[06:41.600 --> 06:45.900]  This is how good I have these memorized for your eyes only
[06:45.900 --> 06:53.700]  which is not good and then came Octopussy, which is a great
[06:53.700 --> 06:58.000]  title and then his last one was a View to a Kill which he
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.200]  was pretty old for because one of the things people don't
[07:00.200 --> 07:03.500]  realize is Roger Moore is actually older was older last
[07:03.500 --> 07:05.700]  week. This talk about him in the past tense was older than
[07:05.700 --> 07:06.400]  Sean Connery.
[07:06.400 --> 07:09.300]  So they replace Sean Connery with an actor who is already
[07:09.300 --> 07:12.500]  a couple of like, I don't know like nine months older than
[07:12.500 --> 07:15.900]  Sean Connery so they didn't recast it younger when they
[07:15.900 --> 07:20.500]  replaced him with more and you know, I remember as a kid
[07:20.500 --> 07:23.300]  when when a View to a Kill came out I was like 12 or 13 or
[07:23.300 --> 07:25.500]  something like that and and all of the reviews mentioned
[07:25.500 --> 07:28.900]  how old Roger Moore was it was just it's it's just what
[07:28.900 --> 07:33.000]  they reviewed but if you watch it it kind of holds up and
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.300]  I don't think that they were pretending that he was a young
[07:35.300 --> 07:39.000]  man, you know, it's like well Bond is 50 55 years old and
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.400]  he's still on on the service.
[07:40.400 --> 07:41.000]  So what?
[07:42.100 --> 07:46.300]  Yeah, they never did make much of a big case about that.
[07:46.300 --> 07:50.300]  I mean Bond Bond was just cool, you know, yeah, he can do
[07:50.300 --> 07:54.300]  all this this crazy stuff and because he's Bond doesn't
[07:54.300 --> 07:55.100]  matter how old he is.
[07:55.100 --> 07:57.100]  He's good-looking he's Bond he gets lots of women.
[07:57.100 --> 08:04.100]  That's that's the character and he likes to drive fast
[08:04.100 --> 08:08.100]  cars like fast cars with all kinds of toys oil slakes and
[08:08.100 --> 08:11.000]  machine guns and submarines.
[08:11.000 --> 08:11.600]  Yep.
[08:13.100 --> 08:17.600]  That almost sounds like you but that's your life right
[08:17.600 --> 08:20.300]  there martinis martinis.
[08:20.300 --> 08:27.000]  Yes, but now really does seem before we get off
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.700]  it. It really does seem to I wrote I linked a whole and
[08:29.700 --> 08:31.000]  everybody knows I love Bond.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.700]  So why not when when Roger Moore dies spend a week with
[08:34.700 --> 08:35.400]  lots of links.
[08:35.400 --> 08:39.700]  He just seems like he was a genuinely great guy.
[08:39.700 --> 08:43.600]  He really did devote the last few decades of his life to
[08:43.600 --> 08:48.200]  UNICEF, which is a great cause he really did seem to care
[08:48.200 --> 08:51.300]  and and you know like that there was this story that some
[08:51.300 --> 08:54.000]  guy passed around and it seems legit because he's got the
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.900]  autograph about when he was a seven did you see that that
[08:56.900 --> 08:59.300]  story I posted where he was a seven-year-old and he met
[08:59.300 --> 09:01.600]  Roger Moore in an airport in 1983.
[09:01.600 --> 09:02.600]  I didn't see that one.
[09:02.600 --> 09:03.300]  Okay.
[09:03.300 --> 09:05.600]  So for those who missed it, this is great story.
[09:05.600 --> 09:07.900]  I will put it in the show notes.
[09:07.900 --> 09:11.100]  I swear to God.
[09:11.100 --> 09:18.100]  So this kid is seven years old 1983.
[09:18.100 --> 09:20.100]  He's in the airport in nice.
[09:20.100 --> 09:21.200]  I don't know how you pronounce it.
[09:21.200 --> 09:27.600]  Nice nice nice and he's with his grandfather and he's and
[09:27.600 --> 09:31.500]  he said this is like before they were like first-class
[09:31.500 --> 09:34.600]  lounges and he's just sitting there right at the airport
[09:34.600 --> 09:37.800]  terminal is Roger Moore reading the newspaper and he says
[09:37.800 --> 09:38.600]  oh my God granddad.
[09:38.600 --> 09:41.800]  That's that's James Bond and his grandfather has no idea
[09:41.800 --> 09:44.100]  who James Bond is no idea who Roger Moore is, but he knows
[09:44.100 --> 09:47.600]  his kid is very excited and this man is very famous and he
[09:47.600 --> 09:50.000]  says would you like me to introduce you to him and he goes
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.100]  yeah, yeah, yeah, so the grandfather walks up and he goes
[09:52.100 --> 09:52.800]  excuse me, sir.
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.900]  My son says you're very famous.
[09:54.900 --> 09:58.700]  We don't mean to bother you but would you would you mind
[09:58.700 --> 10:02.300]  signing the back of his plane ticket and Roger Moore?
[10:02.300 --> 10:04.600]  He says it's very gracious and said oh it would be my pleasure
[10:04.600 --> 10:07.300]  and he folds down the newspaper and takes a pen and he asks
[10:07.300 --> 10:10.000]  him his name and writes a little you know thing Timothy
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.500]  good luck, you know best wishes Roger Moore and the kid
[10:13.500 --> 10:15.400]  walks away and the kid said I you know, I didn't really
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.200]  read cursive at the time but I kind of read it and I could
[10:18.200 --> 10:20.400]  tell that he whatever he signed his name.
[10:20.400 --> 10:21.600]  It didn't say James Bond.
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.600]  And he says grandpa granddad.
[10:25.600 --> 10:26.200]  What does this say?
[10:26.200 --> 10:29.300]  And he says best wishes to me to you know, Roger Moore and
[10:29.300 --> 10:30.300]  he goes that's not his name.
[10:30.300 --> 10:31.600]  His name is James Bond.
[10:32.200 --> 10:34.900]  And now the kid thinks that now that the kids granddad
[10:34.900 --> 10:37.200]  thinks that maybe Roger Moore is an asshole and like prank
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.200]  the kid and he went up to him and said hey my kid says
[10:40.200 --> 10:43.000]  that's not the right name that your name is James Bond.
[10:43.100 --> 10:45.900]  Oh my say the kid says Roger Moore just looked at him and
[10:45.900 --> 10:48.800]  he had him, you know, and he gave him that Roger Moore
[10:48.800 --> 10:51.800]  raised eyebrow and had him come close and he whispered
[10:51.800 --> 10:52.400]  to the kid.
[10:53.700 --> 10:56.600]  My name is James Bond, but when I'm traveling I must use
[10:56.600 --> 10:57.300]  a fake name.
[11:01.700 --> 11:06.000]  Oh my god, and he says now, you know and I know but you
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.600]  must keep this between us and the kid just walked off and
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.600]  said all of a sudden instead of having the wrong autograph
[11:11.600 --> 11:12.100]  on a ticket.
[11:12.100 --> 11:17.700]  I was on a mission with James Bond Wow, and then the kid
[11:17.700 --> 11:20.400]  grew up and worked in like the film industry and was on
[11:20.400 --> 11:20.800]  the set.
[11:20.800 --> 11:23.500]  It was doing a TV commercial for UNICEF where Roger Moore
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.200]  was going to be there.
[11:24.200 --> 11:25.500]  Now the kids like 30 years old.
[11:25.500 --> 11:30.000]  It's 20 years later and during the day he like, you know
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.700]  walked up to him and said hey, you probably won't remember
[11:32.700 --> 11:34.500]  me but back in 1983.
[11:34.500 --> 11:38.200]  I was seven years old and niece and I met you at the airport
[11:38.300 --> 11:40.700]  and and he told Roger Moore the story and Roger Moore
[11:40.700 --> 11:42.900]  laughs and says I don't remember that but that's that
[11:42.900 --> 11:47.400]  sounds like me, you know, and then they shoot this commercial
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.800]  and at the end of the day the guys walking down the hallway
[11:49.800 --> 11:52.200]  and and Roger Moore is leaving as well to go, you know,
[11:52.200 --> 11:54.400]  his car is going to pick him up take him to his hotel and
[11:54.400 --> 11:57.200]  more says to him in the hallway and he goes, of course
[11:57.200 --> 11:59.900]  I remembered you but you can't trust those cameramen.
[12:01.100 --> 12:02.900]  Any one of them could be working for specter.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.300]  Oh, wow, that's that's great.
[12:08.400 --> 12:09.400]  What a story.
[12:09.400 --> 12:11.500]  It's a scene and it just seems like Roger Moore was the
[12:11.500 --> 12:14.100]  type of guy who that sort of thing came naturally to and
[12:14.100 --> 12:16.100]  you just know that I bought when he says that he raised
[12:16.100 --> 12:16.600]  his eyebrow.
[12:16.600 --> 12:18.100]  You just know the look right?
[12:18.200 --> 12:18.600]  Yeah.
[12:18.600 --> 12:19.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[12:20.300 --> 12:24.400]  But what a great comeback, you know, so great.
[12:24.400 --> 12:26.300]  Of course, I'm James Bond.
[12:26.700 --> 12:27.600]  All right, let's take a break here.
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.800]  I'm gonna thank our first sponsor.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.200]  Let's get this show rolling.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.600]  It's our good friends at Squarespace.
[12:33.200 --> 12:35.900]  Look when you need to make a new website.
[12:35.900 --> 12:36.200]  I don't know.
[12:36.200 --> 12:37.500]  Maybe you're going to start a podcast.
[12:37.500 --> 12:39.100]  A lot of people are starting podcasts, you know, where
[12:39.100 --> 12:40.000]  you can put your podcast.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.400]  You can put it at Squarespace and guess what instead of
[12:42.400 --> 12:45.800]  worrying about like creating a CMS or hooking up a CMS
[12:45.800 --> 12:47.800]  or how you're going to post stuff and how you're going
[12:47.800 --> 12:51.000]  to get how you're going to get an RSS feed and an iTunes
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.000]  feed. Guess what?
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.300]  You do it at Squarespace and it all happens automatically.
[12:54.800 --> 12:56.800]  Oh, your website isn't a podcast.
[12:56.800 --> 12:57.300]  It's something else.
[12:57.300 --> 12:58.900]  You guys you're going to start selling stuff.
[12:58.900 --> 13:01.200]  Maybe you're maybe you make like custom t-shirts or
[13:01.200 --> 13:01.700]  something like that.
[13:01.700 --> 13:02.500]  You need a store.
[13:02.700 --> 13:04.500]  Guess what set it up at Squarespace.
[13:04.500 --> 13:09.500]  Squarespace lets you build websites and it makes it so
[13:09.500 --> 13:13.300]  easy and you do it right there in the website itself.
[13:13.300 --> 13:18.400]  It's totally WYSIWYG totally visual you use Squarespace
[13:18.400 --> 13:19.200]  sites every day.
[13:19.200 --> 13:21.700]  I guarantee it and you have no idea you're using a Squarespace
[13:21.700 --> 13:24.900]  site unless you look at the source code because the branding
[13:24.900 --> 13:26.400]  is all yours.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.400]  It's whatever you want.
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.000]  It's like opening, you know, they have these great templates
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.400]  to start with but it's as easy to customize or as fully
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.800]  customizable as an image in Photoshop anything that you can
[13:37.800 --> 13:40.600]  imagine you could do so the branding can be all yours.
[13:41.300 --> 13:44.400]  It's just a terrific way to build a website and they take
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.500]  care of every single aspect of it.
[13:46.500 --> 13:48.400]  You can register your domain name with them.
[13:48.700 --> 13:51.800]  They handle all of the hosting when you have a store they
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.100]  handle all of the Commerce and all of the technical stuff
[13:55.100 --> 13:59.000]  related to this secure socket layers and keeping the credit
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.800]  card information secure all of that and to top it all off.
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.200]  They have 24 hour a day tech support real live humans.
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.900]  And so when you have a question about how to do something
[14:11.900 --> 14:15.000]  you can get in touch with them any time of the day.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.600]  So maybe you're doing this as like a hobby at night and you
[14:18.600 --> 14:20.900]  need to get in contact with them at 10 o'clock in the evening.
[14:20.900 --> 14:21.400]  Guess what?
[14:21.400 --> 14:25.700]  They're available great service great stuff next time you
[14:25.700 --> 14:28.700]  need to build a website go to Squarespace and start a free
[14:28.700 --> 14:32.100]  trial and see how far you can go before you try anything
[14:32.100 --> 14:35.100]  else and when you do sign up just remember this offer code
[14:35.100 --> 14:41.600]  Gruber my last name G R U B E R and you will get 10% off

[14:43.100 --> 14:45.500]  You can sign up for a year at a time use that 10% and you'll
[14:45.500 --> 14:48.500]  save a bundle on like a year of hosting at Squarespace.
[14:49.100 --> 14:52.400]  So my thanks to Squarespace for their continued support of
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.000]  the talk show.
[14:53.800 --> 14:55.500]  They really are easy to use.
[14:55.600 --> 14:56.600]  It's good people.
[14:57.200 --> 14:57.500]  Yeah.
[14:57.800 --> 14:58.000]  Yeah.
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.500]  Got some good coffee here, Jim.
[15:00.100 --> 15:00.700]  Yeah, me too.
[15:00.700 --> 15:03.200]  I think it's very obvious what we want to talk about just
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.600]  in the noodling before the show is it's here is we're recording
[15:07.600 --> 15:10.300]  on May 25th WWDC is coming up fast.
[15:10.300 --> 15:12.600]  Let's talk about what we expect at WWDC.
[15:13.300 --> 15:15.400]  Well, I mean, that's a show right there, right?
[15:15.900 --> 15:21.500]  There's definitely going to be new iPhones brand new design
[15:21.500 --> 15:22.400]  with lasers.
[15:22.400 --> 15:25.400]  Brand new design with lasers.
[15:28.800 --> 15:33.700]  Okay, so what would James Bond have on his iPhone today?
[15:35.700 --> 15:38.900]  This is serious question because we actually our iPhones
[15:38.900 --> 15:40.600]  and our Apple watches.
[15:40.600 --> 15:43.800]  I actually almost called it an iWatch there are Apple which
[15:43.800 --> 15:47.900]  I never do and our Apple watches are like James Bond gadgets.
[15:47.900 --> 15:51.100]  I mean, I've said this before I put it in my initial Apple
[15:51.100 --> 15:54.800]  Watch review where it bought Roger Moore in this by who love
[15:54.800 --> 15:56.500]  me has a little digital watch us.
[15:56.500 --> 16:00.400]  It's a Seiko and it it it gives him secure text messages
[16:00.400 --> 16:03.100]  from MI6 headquarters except instead of showing them on
[16:03.100 --> 16:06.100]  the screen it prints them out on ticker ticker tape.
[16:12.700 --> 16:14.800]  Like if you think you know, like where it where does the
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.100]  spool of ticker tape go now now that's what I want in my
[16:19.100 --> 16:19.800]  Apple Watch.
[16:19.800 --> 16:21.500]  I want a ticker tape thing.
[16:21.500 --> 16:24.900]  So when my text come in it will print them right like being
[16:24.900 --> 16:29.200]  able to to raise your wrist and see a text message that
[16:29.200 --> 16:32.300]  was sent totally securely like an iMessage where it's got
[16:32.300 --> 16:36.900]  end-to-end encryption is a James Bond feature of was when
[16:36.900 --> 16:38.700]  we were kids now, it's something you can go out and buy
[16:38.700 --> 16:40.600]  for $299.
[16:41.300 --> 16:44.100]  Yeah, I want that I don't what would James Bond have on
[16:44.100 --> 16:47.300]  his iPhone that normal people don't have I mean like a switch
[16:47.300 --> 16:53.600]  blades like what do you call it?
[16:53.600 --> 16:55.600]  What do you call those zappers like a cattle prod?
[16:55.600 --> 16:56.200]  You know what I mean?
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.800]  Like the a stun gun type thing like tasers taser.
[16:58.800 --> 17:00.600]  Yeah, I think a taser would be useful.
[17:01.700 --> 17:04.400]  No, he would have to have like a laser or something that
[17:04.400 --> 17:06.300]  he could shoot with wouldn't he?
[17:06.300 --> 17:09.800]  I mean, it's got to be something Roger Moore had a laser
[17:09.800 --> 17:11.800]  on his on his watch one minute one of those movies.
[17:11.800 --> 17:12.900]  I think it live and let die.
[17:12.900 --> 17:16.700]  Remember that he was he was jumping on crocodile heads
[17:16.700 --> 17:25.100]  and as you would you know, no there's not going to be
[17:25.100 --> 17:27.800]  an iPhone no iPhones at WWDC correct?
[17:27.800 --> 17:29.900]  No, no, no iPhones.
[17:29.900 --> 17:34.500]  So let's first let's talk about what we know is going
[17:34.500 --> 17:38.600]  to be there and that software right because it is WWDC
[17:38.600 --> 17:41.700]  it is and that's one thing that people have to remember
[17:41.700 --> 17:45.400]  going into this I would expect that there would be some
[17:45.400 --> 17:48.400]  other things that they talk about but software is the
[17:48.400 --> 17:48.800]  big thing.
[17:48.800 --> 17:51.500]  Well, and the other thing about software is that software
[17:52.600 --> 17:57.400]  and again, I don't want to make light of the job that
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.100]  Apple's software engineering teams do as compared to hardware
[18:01.300 --> 18:06.100]  but hardware is like a if the idea is a complete product
[18:06.600 --> 18:10.700]  and one aspect of it falls behind schedule for the most
[18:10.700 --> 18:12.800]  part that means the whole project is delayed.
[18:13.100 --> 18:17.800]  So like let's say for example, there is a new iPhone coming
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.700]  out that has an OLED screen instead of the LED screens
[18:21.700 --> 18:25.200]  that the current ones have had to date and the whole thing
[18:25.200 --> 18:27.900]  is planned around this and at some point, you know, let's
[18:27.900 --> 18:30.700]  say right now they find out the supply of OLED that we
[18:30.700 --> 18:32.300]  need the exact one we need.
[18:32.300 --> 18:35.200]  It's not going to meet demand that might set the whole
[18:35.200 --> 18:38.100]  thing back maybe if they don't or they have to switch it
[18:38.100 --> 18:41.600]  but with a software project like iOS and Mac OS and TV
[18:41.600 --> 18:44.700]  OS and whatever they might say here's the seven things
[18:44.700 --> 18:49.600]  we want in iOS 11 and if two of them are like maybe not
[18:49.600 --> 18:52.500]  ready they can just go with the five that are ready and
[18:52.500 --> 18:55.500]  say well those two that aren't you know, we were hoping
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.900]  to get those two out this year, but we'll do those next
[18:57.900 --> 18:59.000]  year, right?
[18:59.000 --> 19:04.700]  So the annual nature of the software it's more or less
[19:04.700 --> 19:08.200]  just which which major features are going to are on schedule
[19:08.300 --> 19:09.200]  and then they make the cut.
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.000]  So we're going to see iOS 11.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.300]  We're going to see Mac OS 10.13, right?
[19:14.800 --> 19:19.000]  Yeah, and they'll they'll show us some some new features
[19:19.100 --> 19:20.600]  that are going to be in there.
[19:20.700 --> 19:24.400]  There's always you know, a couple of things that people
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.400]  really looking for in recent years.
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.200]  It's been a lot of integration between the two and then
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.600]  they'll open up, you know, a bunch of new apis and developers
[19:36.600 --> 19:39.300]  get to work and it's funny, you know, I was talking to
[19:39.300 --> 19:44.300]  James Dempsey yesterday the day before and I said, you
[19:44.300 --> 19:49.200]  know, when a lot of the press sit there we look at the
[19:49.200 --> 19:54.400]  WDC keynote and they announce, you know, a new iPad or
[19:54.400 --> 19:58.200]  you know an iPod in years past and and we all clap but
[19:58.200 --> 20:02.300]  they they announce, you know, a new API and like 5,000
[20:02.300 --> 20:06.500]  people start screaming and co-op and and the rest of us
[20:06.500 --> 20:07.600]  are sitting there saying okay.
[20:07.600 --> 20:09.200]  Well, I guess that's a big deal.
[20:10.100 --> 20:15.300]  Yeah, like it's I think probably the best example of that
[20:15.700 --> 20:20.000]  that I can remember would be when when they announced Swift.
[20:20.900 --> 20:25.600]  Yeah, I got it because I'm a little bit programmer enough.
[20:25.600 --> 20:27.000]  I mean, I have a computer science degree.
[20:27.000 --> 20:30.900]  I mean, so I I know exactly what they meant, you know, and
[20:30.900 --> 20:39.400]  I know firsthand how polarizing Objective-C is like it's
[20:39.400 --> 20:42.700]  it's a weird the thing about Objective-C that's undeniable
[20:42.700 --> 20:45.500]  and I think even in a non programmer could just look at
[20:45.500 --> 20:48.500]  the source code and you see all these square brackets around
[20:48.500 --> 20:52.900]  everything and it doesn't look like other programming languages
[20:52.900 --> 20:58.100]  whereas Swift looks a lot like JavaScript and other just
[20:58.100 --> 21:00.600]  sort of generic programming languages.
[21:00.600 --> 21:06.300]  It's sort of closer to the ideal of pseudocode and man when
[21:06.300 --> 21:10.100]  they announced Swift that we've got an all-new programming
[21:10.100 --> 21:13.200]  language that we've invented and it's just you know optimized
[21:13.200 --> 21:16.400]  for Apple stuff and it's our language for the future that
[21:16.400 --> 21:20.300]  room erupted and the press area was like, what does this mean?
[21:20.300 --> 21:24.000]  Yeah, it's true.
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.200]  Absolutely true.
[21:25.200 --> 21:30.100]  But WDC in a lot of ways is completely different than the
[21:30.100 --> 21:31.500]  other events that we go to.
[21:31.500 --> 21:32.600]  Yeah, totally.
[21:32.600 --> 21:37.400]  And then the fact that they brought Chris Latner out to do
[21:37.400 --> 21:41.700]  the introduction was again, you know that Chris Latner has
[21:41.700 --> 21:44.500]  since he left actually in the last year and is now works at
[21:44.500 --> 21:48.500]  Tesla, but he's you know, he was been in charge of Apple's
[21:48.500 --> 21:50.700]  programming language stuff for a long time.
[21:50.700 --> 21:55.000]  He invented LLVM and CLang and he's the original guy
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.100]  who invented Swift before it became a group project.
[21:59.600 --> 22:06.400]  He is a rock star in Apple developer circles like he and
[22:06.400 --> 22:09.600]  his reaction to seeing him on stage in the keynote not just
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.400]  in the afternoon State of the Tech Union, you know keynote,
[22:12.400 --> 22:15.900]  but the real keynote like people were acting like, you know,
[22:15.900 --> 22:20.100]  Dave Grohl and Foo Fighters came on stage, right?
[22:20.100 --> 22:22.400]  They were yeah, it's absolutely true.
[22:22.400 --> 22:25.700]  The press area is everybody most of the people a lot of the
[22:25.700 --> 22:29.300]  people were like googling Chris Latner, you know, and they're
[22:29.300 --> 22:32.800]  like who the hell is this and why is he getting this rousing
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.100]  ovation where he has to wait it for everybody to calm down
[22:36.100 --> 22:37.200]  before he starts talking.
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.200]  Yeah.
[22:38.200 --> 22:42.900]  So what do you but that's that's who it's for that's that's
[22:42.900 --> 22:44.100]  who this conference is for.
[22:44.100 --> 22:47.800]  Well, it's it's an interesting balance because it is for
[22:47.800 --> 22:50.300]  the mass market like Apple definitely expects front page
[22:50.300 --> 22:55.000]  news, you know on newspapers, you know, so it is this interesting
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.400]  mix and and they definitely can save a lot of the more technical
[22:58.400 --> 22:59.900]  stuff for the afternoon keynote.
[22:59.900 --> 23:02.400]  I mean, that's you know, I've often said this that if they
[23:02.400 --> 23:04.900]  don't call it a keynote they call it the State of the Union
[23:05.200 --> 23:08.900]  but the afternoon State of the Union thing really is that
[23:08.900 --> 23:10.100]  the technical keynote.
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.800]  Yeah, and so it's interesting when something truly
[23:13.800 --> 23:16.300]  technical like a new programming language is deemed so
[23:16.300 --> 23:18.500]  important that it makes the morning keynote.
[23:19.400 --> 23:20.400]  Do you go to that?
[23:21.300 --> 23:28.400]  I wish that I did and I try to if I can but the last few
[23:28.400 --> 23:33.500]  years I've had like the private briefings post keynote
[23:33.500 --> 23:36.600]  briefings about what's in the morning keynote in the afternoon
[23:36.600 --> 23:41.400]  and those they tend to run behind and so it's generally
[23:41.400 --> 23:43.000]  impossible for me to make that.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  So I watch it afterwards on video.
[23:45.500 --> 23:46.200]  Yeah, me too.
[23:47.400 --> 23:47.800]  Me too.
[23:47.800 --> 23:53.100]  I think I've been in the I don't know the past five or six
[23:53.100 --> 23:54.400]  years. I may have been to one.
[23:56.300 --> 23:57.400]  And it is interesting.
[23:57.400 --> 24:01.100]  It's interesting missing it because I write about Apple stuff
[24:01.100 --> 24:04.400]  at a technical enough level and you do too where some of
[24:04.400 --> 24:09.400]  the stuff in that and that that session we would we would
[24:09.400 --> 24:12.900]  write about on our websites, but I don't hear about it and
[24:12.900 --> 24:15.300]  I'm in a briefing and then all of a sudden it's like five
[24:15.300 --> 24:19.000]  o'clock and I'm like, you know, maybe like meeting people
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.100]  for beer or something like that and then they'll bring up
[24:21.100 --> 24:21.700]  something like that.
[24:21.700 --> 24:23.400]  I'm like what when was that announced and they're like in
[24:23.400 --> 24:25.100]  the afternoon and it's like, holy shit.
[24:29.100 --> 24:29.600]  Sorry.
[24:31.300 --> 24:31.700]  Yeah.
[24:32.900 --> 24:34.500]  Yeah, it always happens though.
[24:34.500 --> 24:41.200]  But you know those those two things those two keynotes that
[24:41.200 --> 24:47.400]  pretty much lays out everything I expect the theme I do think
[24:47.400 --> 24:50.600]  I would say this I think Apple has kept a very tight lid
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.300]  on whatever it is.
[24:51.300 --> 24:54.000]  They're announcing I think a they have a lot to announce.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.800]  I think it's going to be a very busy keynote with a lot of
[24:57.800 --> 24:58.600]  announcements.
[24:59.900 --> 25:02.700]  I just have that sense and I think a lot of other people
[25:02.700 --> 25:03.200]  do too.
[25:04.500 --> 25:06.400]  But for the most part nothing is leaked yet.
[25:07.100 --> 25:09.200]  No, I mean what is it has anything leaked?
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.400]  I don't think so.
[25:10.400 --> 25:17.700]  Okay, so run through it then Apple watch nothing is leaked
[25:17.700 --> 25:21.500]  right and I can't help but think that they are going to have
[25:21.500 --> 25:24.000]  a watch OS for announcement.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.300]  I this is what I think about that.
[25:26.300 --> 25:31.900]  I think that watch OS 3 was so major in terms of okay.
[25:31.900 --> 25:36.000]  They really focused on the two things people really like
[25:36.000 --> 25:39.600]  about Apple watch are the fitness tracking and notifications
[25:39.600 --> 25:45.200]  and they coalesce the whole OS even how you use the hardware
[25:45.200 --> 25:50.800]  buttons and the roller and you know, and I don't think that
[25:50.800 --> 25:54.900]  there is a way for watch OS 4 to be as big a change as watch
[25:54.900 --> 26:00.600]  OS 3 was because they've coalesced on on the the heart of
[26:00.600 --> 26:02.500]  what Apple watch is really good for.
[26:05.200 --> 26:08.800]  Did you see the I wrote a piece a little while ago about
[26:08.800 --> 26:12.800]  using my Apple watch without an iPhone.
[26:14.200 --> 26:17.200]  And what I found I did it on.
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.200]  Well, I didn't do it on purpose at first but I got one of
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.600]  the red iPhones and I didn't sync my watch with it.
[26:25.800 --> 26:33.200]  And I started missing phone calls text messages emails
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.100]  because my phone was on silent because I had my my watch
[26:37.100 --> 26:39.600]  on and it was linked to my watch so I would get everything
[26:39.600 --> 26:42.700]  coming in and my watch would vibrate and I would pick up
[26:42.700 --> 26:46.100]  the phone and answer it and you know, do whatever all of
[26:46.100 --> 26:49.100]  a sudden I was missing everything and people would say,
[26:49.100 --> 26:54.000]  you know, I tried calling you on a look and sure enough.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.500]  There's you know, with a list of phone calls and text messages.
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.100]  So it's become subconscious for you that your notifications
[27:01.100 --> 27:03.100]  are going to be on your wrist is what yeah.
[27:03.100 --> 27:09.100]  Yeah, so I didn't have to I never have to pick up my my
[27:09.100 --> 27:12.000]  my phone anymore because I have everything I need on my
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.900]  watch. So when I didn't pair the two of them, it was it
[27:17.900 --> 27:21.400]  was devastating for me, you know, so I so I actually had
[27:21.400 --> 27:22.800]  to go back and do it.
[27:22.800 --> 27:25.400]  I think I think that's a great example.
[27:25.400 --> 27:28.500]  I think that there's it's I think where they're going
[27:28.500 --> 27:31.700]  where they will go with watchos4 is just taking those two
[27:31.700 --> 27:36.700]  areas Fitness and the notifications and and just the subtle
[27:36.700 --> 27:39.700]  niceties that things that you can do with Apple watch like
[27:39.700 --> 27:42.800]  having your Mac unlock just by being near it which I've
[27:42.800 --> 27:44.800]  become addicted to like me too.
[27:45.900 --> 27:49.500]  I swear to God in terms of like drawing a blank on why
[27:49.500 --> 27:51.000]  isn't this working the other day?
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.000]  I was where I wasn't wearing my Apple watch.
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.000]  I was wearing an analog watch, you know mechanical watch
[27:56.500 --> 27:59.700]  and I log I go to my MacBook and I didn't feel that tap
[27:59.700 --> 28:01.500]  on my wrist and it's asking me for my password.
[28:01.500 --> 28:04.800]  And I'm like, what the fuck is handoff broken is continuity
[28:04.800 --> 28:08.400]  broken with and then I like oh I was like duh, of course
[28:08.400 --> 28:09.100]  like yeah again.
[28:10.300 --> 28:13.000]  Yeah, I well I I'm so used to that now.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.200]  I just walk up and hit a button.
[28:15.200 --> 28:18.800]  Yeah, and you know, it wakes up logs me in and I'm done.
[28:18.800 --> 28:22.400]  So yeah, that was another thing when I didn't pair the
[28:22.400 --> 28:26.000]  two I go in and tap my keyboard and it would I'd sit there
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.600]  looking at the screen like it was it's one of my favorite
[28:29.600 --> 28:32.400]  features of Apple watch because it does remind me I mean
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.800]  I've had a password on my MacBook for a long time now really
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.000]  ever since I started traveling and by airplane semi-frequently,
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.500]  but when I first got like a power book, I guess it was
[28:45.500 --> 28:48.100]  my first was that what I owned was an iBook back in the
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.000]  day. I didn't even you know, I didn't put a password on
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.900]  it because it was too too annoying compared to just lifting
[28:53.900 --> 28:55.500]  the screen and at being logged in.
[28:56.500 --> 28:58.200]  I don't even know if you could back then could you could
[28:58.200 --> 29:00.700]  you put it like back into Mac OS 9 days?
[29:00.700 --> 29:02.700]  Could you put a password on a machine?
[29:03.500 --> 29:06.700]  Remember we had they had voice login.
[29:06.800 --> 29:11.300]  Yeah, but you it was like but Mac OS 9 was so not secure
[29:11.300 --> 29:13.900]  by default that if you just force rebooted the machine,
[29:13.900 --> 29:17.200]  it would just start up and you'd I mean it is, you know,
[29:17.200 --> 29:19.900]  I mean you laugh but you know, you didn't think anything
[29:19.900 --> 29:20.600]  happening today.
[29:20.600 --> 29:22.000]  There were no user accounts.
[29:22.000 --> 29:22.600]  You know what I mean?
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.800]  It was like you just turn the thing on and it and it in
[29:24.800 --> 29:28.100]  there you were which was super convenient and you know,
[29:28.100 --> 29:30.800]  eventually, you know with good security and having your
[29:30.800 --> 29:33.400]  disk encrypted and so you can feel safe that if somebody
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.100]  you know, it if somebody stole or you know, my MacBook
[29:37.100 --> 29:39.300]  in the airport, they can't get my date, you know, they
[29:39.300 --> 29:42.400]  haven't they have a nice MacBook they can sell but they
[29:42.400 --> 29:43.400]  can't get to my data.
[29:45.100 --> 29:47.600]  So it's worth it for that but just having your Apple Watch
[29:47.600 --> 29:51.300]  on unlock it automatically just by like touching a button.
[29:51.300 --> 29:53.400]  It takes you back to those days where you could just you're
[29:53.400 --> 29:54.100]  just in.
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.100]  And it's very secure.
[29:57.100 --> 30:00.300]  Yeah, so I think that they'll the Apple Watch announcements
[30:00.300 --> 30:02.400]  who knows and when we don't know what they are, but it's
[30:02.400 --> 30:05.100]  I just think they'll be about adding more nice things that
[30:05.100 --> 30:07.900]  happen just by being in proximity to something.
[30:10.200 --> 30:11.900]  What about Apple Watch hardware?
[30:11.900 --> 30:14.100]  I don't think that they'll announce it at WWDC.
[30:14.100 --> 30:16.800]  I think that that's considered a September thing.
[30:16.800 --> 30:19.700]  That's what I think it would be a very big surprise if
[30:19.700 --> 30:20.300]  they did though.
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.200]  Yeah, but I just don't think so and I do think I think
[30:25.200 --> 30:28.900]  that you know, and we will get to that in a moment, but
[30:28.900 --> 30:32.500]  I think that that also limits some of the fitness announcements
[30:32.500 --> 30:34.300]  they can make because I think there's only so much they
[30:34.300 --> 30:36.900]  can do in the OS whereas a lot of the improvements.
[30:36.900 --> 30:38.800]  I think they want to make require new hardware.
[30:39.900 --> 30:45.200]  Which like for example, the the story that MS or CNBC has
[30:45.200 --> 30:49.800]  been tracking it where where they've reported that Apple
[30:49.800 --> 30:54.800]  is working on glucose monitoring non-invasive continuous
[30:54.800 --> 30:58.200]  glucose monitoring and they even said that Tim Cook personally
[30:58.200 --> 31:02.800]  is wearing an Apple Watch prototype around Apple's campus
[31:02.800 --> 31:03.500]  that does it.
[31:04.100 --> 31:04.600]  Yes.
[31:07.500 --> 31:08.800]  This is such a huge deal.
[31:09.000 --> 31:12.000]  I don't personally have anybody in my immediate family
[31:12.000 --> 31:16.700]  who has diabetes, but I have friends who have kids with
[31:16.700 --> 31:20.400]  diabetes a couple of friends who have kids with juvenile
[31:20.400 --> 31:24.500]  diabetes and you know, all of them are super healthy and
[31:24.500 --> 31:27.500]  they're all getting great medical care, but it is a 24
[31:27.500 --> 31:31.900]  hour a day non-stop source of minor stress on the parents
[31:32.000 --> 31:32.800]  and the kid.
[31:32.800 --> 31:35.500]  I mean because the only way to monitor your blood is through
[31:35.500 --> 31:37.300]  the pricks and that sucks.
[31:37.300 --> 31:39.400]  It sucks even if you're an adult, but guess what like if
[31:39.400 --> 31:41.900]  you have a seven-year-old and you've you know, like they're
[31:41.900 --> 31:45.000]  sick and you get the diagnosis like it's always good news
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.500]  when you figure out what is wrong right and you say we know
[31:47.500 --> 31:49.800]  exactly what's wrong, you know, we have bad news your kids
[31:49.800 --> 31:53.400]  diabetic but the good news is you know, it's totally treatable
[31:53.400 --> 31:56.000]  but you tell a seven-year-old that you're going to have to
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.300]  pick prick their skin and get a blood sample every day for
[31:59.300 --> 32:00.100]  the rest of their life.
[32:00.100 --> 32:05.800]  I mean that it just doesn't fly, you know, so continue to
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.600]  have it but in a non-invasive continuous method through the
[32:08.600 --> 32:11.500]  watch I did it would be so great for the kids so great for
[32:11.500 --> 32:14.800]  adults who have diabetes and then the thing that that occurs
[32:14.800 --> 32:19.200]  to me personally because my wife and I our son has a really
[32:19.200 --> 32:21.000]  severe anaphylactic dairy allergy.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.900]  Like if he has even just a little bit of dairy, he gets
[32:24.900 --> 32:28.900]  violently ill and and has passed out even in like a hospital
[32:28.900 --> 32:32.900]  setting with like an eighth of a teaspoon of milk and we've
[32:32.900 --> 32:35.500]  been really lucky over the years and he's a real cautious
[32:35.500 --> 32:38.800]  kid and he just does he just by default if he doesn't know
[32:38.800 --> 32:39.500]  what's in something.
[32:39.500 --> 32:40.400]  He just doesn't need it.
[32:40.400 --> 32:43.900]  He'll go hungry rather than take a flyer on whether there's
[32:43.900 --> 32:49.300]  dairy and food but especially for my wife because she's a
[32:49.300 --> 32:52.000]  bigger worrier than me every single day, especially when he
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.400]  was a younger kid, but you know, he's 13 now, but when he
[32:54.400 --> 32:57.100]  was like, you know, first grade second grade, it's every day.
[32:57.100 --> 32:59.900]  I mean in his school is great and allergies are so common
[32:59.900 --> 33:02.400]  now that you know, schools are school nurses are all hooked,
[33:02.400 --> 33:05.400]  you know, well aware of which kids have which allergies but
[33:05.400 --> 33:10.600]  in the back of my wife's mind, it's constantly stress like
[33:10.600 --> 33:13.300]  what if he accidentally gets dairy now dairies different,
[33:13.300 --> 33:17.900]  but imagine if he had diabetes instead and not only is he
[33:17.900 --> 33:21.200]  and he could wear an Apple watch if if my wife could get
[33:21.200 --> 33:22.600]  that notification to that.
[33:22.600 --> 33:26.900]  Hey, you know, his glucose is high or low.
[33:28.200 --> 33:32.500]  Not only could she help him but just on the normal days
[33:32.500 --> 33:35.500]  when there's no problem the fact that she knows his glucose
[33:35.500 --> 33:38.200]  is fine because she doesn't have that alert would be it's
[33:38.200 --> 33:39.900]  life-changing right?
[33:39.900 --> 33:47.700]  I mean, that's a sense of calm, you know, I know everything
[33:47.700 --> 33:48.300]  is okay.
[33:48.300 --> 33:50.900]  I don't know.
[33:50.900 --> 33:52.900]  The thing is about the CNBC report.
[33:52.900 --> 33:55.300]  I am not surprised at all that Apple's working on this.
[33:55.300 --> 34:01.600]  It it's it seems like a perfect Apple problem to solve but
[34:01.600 --> 34:04.100]  there's no indication of whether this is planned for this
[34:04.100 --> 34:06.900]  next, you know, this year's new Apple watches or not like
[34:06.900 --> 34:09.600]  it could be the sort of thing that might be two three years
[34:09.600 --> 34:11.800]  out and it could be the sort of thing that even if they
[34:11.800 --> 34:16.100]  have it working pretty well it for all I know it might be
[34:16.100 --> 34:18.700]  like two or three years of regulatory hurdles before they
[34:18.700 --> 34:21.700]  can ship it right and that's something that you were talking
[34:21.700 --> 34:25.100]  about earlier where you know, the software could be ready
[34:25.100 --> 34:28.100]  but if the hardware is not right and the regulatory stuff,
[34:28.100 --> 34:31.400]  I mean God I can't even imagine what a nightmare that is,
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.800]  you know, and for good reason it should be regulated but
[34:33.800 --> 34:38.400]  it's you know, I'm sure that it's it it moves those type
[34:38.400 --> 34:40.700]  of things move at a much slower pace than the tech world
[34:40.700 --> 34:46.900]  does. All right, so let me let me upset some people here
[34:46.900 --> 34:55.100]  and play devil's advocate and look at this in a cynical
[34:55.100 --> 35:00.400]  way. Do you think Apple is doing this as a way to sell
[35:00.400 --> 35:04.400]  more devices or because they care about health?
[35:04.400 --> 35:09.500]  I think both I do think both I think that of course,
[35:09.500 --> 35:11.700]  they're in the business of selling devices and of course
[35:11.700 --> 35:16.400]  if they can turn this into a device that that health insurance
[35:16.400 --> 35:20.900]  would subsidize the purchase of and I think it would I
[35:20.900 --> 35:24.800]  think health insurance policies would buy kids Apple
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.100]  watches or at least subsidize a big chunk of the price
[35:28.100 --> 35:34.700]  because it's $299 watch or 250 or maybe you know, if it
[35:34.700 --> 35:36.400]  takes two or three years by that time, they'll have one
[35:36.400 --> 35:42.600]  for $199 or something. It could greatly greatly I mean
[35:42.600 --> 35:44.900]  number one, it could absolve them of the cost of the
[35:44.900 --> 35:48.600]  insurance is already covering for the the invasive blood
[35:48.600 --> 35:52.400]  tests, right? And it's going to keep these kids it's going
[35:52.400 --> 35:54.400]  to keep these kids healthier, right? It's going to keep
[35:54.400 --> 35:57.700]  them from from, you know, going to the doctor, you know,
[35:57.700 --> 36:00.400]  by having, you know, the blood sugar drop or something
[36:00.400 --> 36:06.000]  like that. You know, and so yeah, and then once if insurance
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.700]  covers the price then their apples going to sell a boatload
[36:08.700 --> 36:12.600]  more of these watches. I mean diabetes is is you know,
[36:12.600 --> 36:16.600]  obviously fairly common disease. I mean, so I don't know
[36:16.600 --> 36:18.600]  that it's entirely a coincidence that they're attacking
[36:18.600 --> 36:21.000]  a disease where there's a fairly large market of patients
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.800]  as opposed to some more obscure disease that maybe the
[36:24.800 --> 36:28.900]  watch could also do but I feel like the the altruism of
[36:28.900 --> 36:32.800]  it and the business aspect of it go hand in hand. Yeah,
[36:32.800 --> 36:36.100]  and you know what they won't do. Well, here's here's just
[36:36.100 --> 36:39.700]  one last point on this. What they won't do is remember
[36:39.700 --> 36:42.500]  that scumbag guy. I don't even remember his name. I don't
[36:42.500 --> 36:44.500]  want to say his name but the guy who bought the rights
[36:44.500 --> 36:48.000]  to some prescription drug that was like unique and then
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.600]  the first thing I did was raise the price by 10x. Yeah,
[36:51.700 --> 36:55.800]  so like what Apple won't do is no way would they do is
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.700]  make a special edition glucose monitoring Apple watch
[36:58.700 --> 37:02.500]  that costs a thousand dollars. Correct? Yeah, right agree.
[37:02.500 --> 37:04.700]  It would be a thing that everybody gets in their Apple
[37:04.700 --> 37:08.000]  watch. That's where they you know, they won't price gouge
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.900]  the people who need the glucose monitoring one. I truly
[37:13.900 --> 37:21.300]  believe that Apple cares about health and I think that
[37:21.300 --> 37:29.100]  they're researching this as a way to really help people,
[37:29.400 --> 37:32.400]  you know the same with with the fitness and look at how
[37:32.400 --> 37:39.000]  they they went through. You know with with wheelchairs
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.200]  and you know, they worked with those people to say how
[37:43.200 --> 37:46.100]  can we make this better for you? Obviously, we won't tell
[37:46.100 --> 37:50.600]  you to stand anymore because that's rude, you know, but
[37:50.600 --> 37:54.600]  they did a lot of things where they can track for swimmers
[37:54.600 --> 37:57.800]  and for all of these things. I truly believe that they
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.000]  care about that. I do too and as a side effect, they do
[38:02.000 --> 38:06.800]  sell more devices and that's obviously very important
[38:06.800 --> 38:09.600]  to them that is their business. But I think that there
[38:09.600 --> 38:16.700]  are they're starting to pull way out in front of other
[38:16.700 --> 38:20.900]  companies as far as health tracking goes and I include
[38:20.900 --> 38:23.200]  like glucose monitoring and things like that in there.
[38:23.600 --> 38:26.100]  Do you remember the shareholders meeting a couple of
[38:26.100 --> 38:30.700]  years ago where where I think that what happened was
[38:30.700 --> 38:35.600]  that a shareholder stood up and and I think gave Tim
[38:35.600 --> 38:39.700]  Cook grief over Apple's environmental spending. I think
[38:39.700 --> 38:41.900]  it was on him but it doesn't really matter but it was
[38:41.900 --> 38:45.200]  something like that. Let's say like, hey, what's the
[38:45.200 --> 38:47.900]  return on event on investment of this for shareholders
[38:47.900 --> 38:50.500]  with this, you know, I don't care about this, you know,
[38:51.000 --> 38:54.900]  greenhouse gases, you know, and Tim Cook got angry and
[38:54.900 --> 38:57.000]  said, God, I wish there was footage of it. All we have
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.600]  is like people replaying it, but he said, I don't give
[38:59.600 --> 39:02.800]  a damn about your bloody ROI on. There are some issues
[39:02.800 --> 39:05.700]  where we don't give a damn about your bloody ROI and
[39:05.700 --> 39:08.900]  you know that that word bloody was almost the F word.
[39:09.300 --> 39:12.500]  Yeah. Yep. Because Tim Cook isn't British. So I don't
[39:12.500 --> 39:16.800]  think he certainly doesn't sound British, you know,
[39:18.200 --> 39:21.400]  you know, and I think that on this accessibility stuff
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.100]  and and that and some of this stuff it's absolutely
[39:24.100 --> 39:27.200]  not measured as an ROI. I don't think that they sell
[39:27.200 --> 39:29.700]  I don't think making the Apple watch a great fitness
[39:29.700 --> 39:33.200]  tracker for people in wheelchairs. Yes, there are
[39:33.200 --> 39:35.700]  people in wheelchairs who've since bought bought an
[39:35.700 --> 39:38.900]  Apple watch who wouldn't have bought one otherwise
[39:38.900 --> 39:41.900]  because they know that it's going to work for their
[39:41.900 --> 39:44.700]  needs, you know, which are obviously very very different
[39:44.700 --> 39:49.100]  than somebody who's walking. But I don't think that
[39:49.100 --> 39:52.100]  anybody at Apple ever performed the spreadsheet
[39:52.100 --> 39:55.100]  calculation of how many more we can sell versus how
[39:55.100 --> 39:57.500]  much it's going to cost us to develop it. I think
[39:57.500 --> 39:59.700]  that the idea of hey, let's make this thing work for
[39:59.700 --> 40:03.800]  wheelchair people people in wheelchairs and that
[40:03.800 --> 40:05.800]  everybody I think everybody was like, oh, yeah,
[40:05.800 --> 40:07.700]  definitely. Let's do that. I don't I bet there wasn't
[40:07.700 --> 40:10.700]  one person who who said well, let's let's run a cost
[40:10.700 --> 40:15.600]  analysis first agree away. That's and you know, I
[40:15.600 --> 40:17.100]  really do think that that's one of the things that
[40:17.100 --> 40:19.000]  makes Apple a different company. I mean, obviously
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.900]  some of these initiatives are so big on the
[40:21.900 --> 40:23.900]  environmental front that I think they have to be
[40:23.900 --> 40:27.300]  measured financially, you know, you know building
[40:27.300 --> 40:29.400]  out these giant solar farms. I'm sure that they
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.700]  know exactly what the cost you know is but I still
[40:33.700 --> 40:35.400]  don't think that they do them, you know, they
[40:35.400 --> 40:38.100]  certainly don't do them to save money apples not
[40:38.100 --> 40:42.900]  saving money by being carbon-neutral. They truly
[40:42.900 --> 40:45.200]  they truly they see it as a long-term investment
[40:45.200 --> 40:47.300]  in the company by making the world a better place.
[40:48.700 --> 40:53.400]  Yeah, and then there is some energy savings because
[40:53.400 --> 40:58.400]  they're they all I think it's long-term, you know
[40:58.700 --> 41:01.100]  that they are neutral Apple spends more money on
[41:01.100 --> 41:03.200]  energy though because they're carbon-neutral than
[41:03.200 --> 41:04.900]  they would if they said we don't give a shitter for
[41:04.900 --> 41:08.300]  carbon-neutral they would they do they spend more
[41:08.300 --> 41:10.500]  money and there's no there's really no direct
[41:10.500 --> 41:12.600]  return on that investment. There's no immediate
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.500]  return on it. It's it's it's a long-term, you know,
[41:17.300 --> 41:20.300]  if the world is a better place and and and we can
[41:20.300 --> 41:22.300]  set an example that others follow and we can help
[41:22.300 --> 41:25.100]  get these greenhouse gases down Apple will be in
[41:25.100 --> 41:27.700]  better place in 50 years when everybody who's
[41:27.700 --> 41:30.400]  here right now is retired or dead Apple is going
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.400]  to be in a better place because of this because
[41:33.400 --> 41:35.500]  the world's in a better place. I mean, I don't
[41:35.500 --> 41:40.100]  want to go catch up namzy-pamzy here, but I do
[41:40.100 --> 41:41.900]  I think I but I think you're right and I think
[41:41.900 --> 41:43.700]  the fitness stuff I'm telling you right now. I
[41:43.700 --> 41:45.400]  was it last year where they announced that
[41:45.400 --> 41:48.900]  wheelchair support at WWC. I think it was last
[41:48.900 --> 41:50.700]  year. So I think it was last year with watch
[41:50.700 --> 41:53.200]  was three. I mean I teared up in the movie. I
[41:53.200 --> 41:56.400]  mean, it's yes because I and I felt a little
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.600]  guilty because I have to admit that before Apple
[41:58.600 --> 42:01.300]  showed it to me in their intro video. It never
[42:01.300 --> 42:05.400]  even occurred to me that that the default
[42:05.400 --> 42:07.500]  configuration of Apple watch where it assumes
[42:07.500 --> 42:11.300]  that you are walking and running and jogging
[42:11.600 --> 42:13.300]  isn't going to work for someone in a wheelchair
[42:13.600 --> 42:17.100]  just didn't occur to me. And I felt sadly but
[42:17.100 --> 42:19.000]  the way that Apple presented it is about God. I
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  teared up. I was I mean as I get older. I'm
[42:22.000 --> 42:30.900]  getting softer. We all are John speaking of
[42:30.900 --> 42:33.500]  wheelchairs friend of the show David underscore
[42:33.500 --> 42:37.500]  Smith. He's a developer with all the plus plus
[42:37.500 --> 42:40.200]  apps. He's got a pedometer plus plus app that
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.000]  that hooks into health kit and gives you a like
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.800]  a pedometer specific interface. It's a great
[42:46.800 --> 42:48.900]  app. If you're interested in counting your steps
[42:48.900 --> 42:50.500]  and stuff like that, you should really look into
[42:50.500 --> 42:53.600]  it. It's a terrific app. Did you see there's a
[42:53.600 --> 42:55.700]  new feature in iOS that they've added a couple
[42:55.800 --> 42:58.100]  iOS 10 a couple months ago where an app can set
[42:58.100 --> 43:04.200]  a custom icon for the app. So for example, they
[43:04.200 --> 43:06.900]  apparently added it for sports apps. So for
[43:06.900 --> 43:11.400]  example, the MLB app can now it asks you now.
[43:11.400 --> 43:13.900]  Hey, would you like to change the icon for the
[43:13.900 --> 43:16.100]  app to the icon of your favorite team? So for
[43:16.100 --> 43:19.000]  me, I know you can put the Red Sox. Yeah, I
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.100]  could put the Red Sox Tampa Bay Devil race
[43:24.100 --> 43:28.200]  and I actually tried it. It's funny. I tried it
[43:28.200 --> 43:30.900]  when I heard about the feature and I heard that
[43:30.900 --> 43:33.800]  it was all apps can do it. But it was it was I
[43:33.800 --> 43:37.300]  heard I heard somewhere. I think it was I don't
[43:37.300 --> 43:38.500]  think it was through public channels, but I
[43:38.500 --> 43:40.800]  heard somewhere that Eddie Q sort of spearheaded
[43:40.800 --> 43:42.900]  it because of his interest in sports and he
[43:42.900 --> 43:44.700]  knows some of the guys that this, you know, the
[43:44.700 --> 43:49.400]  sports apps and so I tried it and I hated it
[43:49.400 --> 43:51.400]  because I even though I love the Yankees and
[43:51.400 --> 43:52.900]  the Yankees are most of what I care about the
[43:52.900 --> 43:56.900]  MLB app. It totally breaks years of my habit of
[43:56.900 --> 44:00.700]  looking at the MLB logo that the league's logo
[44:00.700 --> 44:03.700]  and tapping that, you know, so I actually turned
[44:03.700 --> 44:08.000]  that off. But anyway, David underscore Smith use
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.600]  that feature and has an option in his pedometer
[44:11.600 --> 44:14.100]  plus plus app to change the icon from somebody
[44:14.100 --> 44:17.000]  walking to somebody in a wheelchair. Oh, that's
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.100]  nice. It's you know, what it's like the same way
[44:20.100 --> 44:22.400]  that honestly it's like the way that people at
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.400]  Apple think of things like that. Yeah, the Apple
[44:25.400 --> 44:29.000]  developer Community is full of when you have
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.200]  somebody who's a developer, but who has a
[44:31.200 --> 44:33.200]  thoughtful sort of human history to them like
[44:33.200 --> 44:36.700]  David Smith. It that's why he's an iOS developer,
[44:36.700 --> 44:38.900]  right? It just is the sort of thing that occurs
[44:38.900 --> 44:43.500]  to you know, the right kind of people. I don't
[44:43.500 --> 44:45.400]  know. I saw that in his change notes. I was like,
[44:45.400 --> 44:49.500]  oh man, that's great feature. What did you think
[44:49.500 --> 44:55.800]  of dirt cheater day? I can't really talk about
[44:55.800 --> 45:03.100]  it, Jim. I have a better story though than Derek
[45:03.100 --> 45:05.000]  cheater J Derek cheater day was Mother's Day
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.800]  and I was thinking about going and taking my
[45:07.800 --> 45:11.300]  son but Amy didn't want to go and it's Mother's
[45:11.300 --> 45:13.100]  Day and Derek cheater picked Mother's Day. It
[45:13.100 --> 45:14.800]  wasn't you know, he said when would you like
[45:14.800 --> 45:17.300]  to have your day and it he said I'd you know,
[45:17.300 --> 45:19.200]  I love my mom so much. I'd love it would be
[45:19.200 --> 45:20.600]  it would be meaningful to me to have it on
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.000]  Mother's Day, but it put me in a position of
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  do we blow off Mother's Day and go see a
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.200]  Yankees game that wouldn't work good idea.
[45:30.200 --> 45:32.800]  Well, I have to say on and all honesty, you
[45:32.800 --> 45:34.600]  know her and so this might you might be
[45:34.600 --> 45:36.800]  surprised but she was honest to God. She was
[45:36.800 --> 45:39.600]  like go seriously, you know, we'll do something
[45:39.600 --> 45:42.100]  on Saturday or whatever. But you know, if you
[45:42.100 --> 45:44.800]  want to go go and I believe you know, like
[45:44.800 --> 45:46.500]  one thing I don't worry about with her. She
[45:46.500 --> 45:51.400]  tells me what she's thinking. So like I don't
[45:51.400 --> 45:53.100]  have to worry about the thing where she might
[45:53.100 --> 45:55.200]  say. Oh, yeah, you should go and then we go and
[45:55.200 --> 45:57.200]  then I find out it was a test and I failed the
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.400]  test. Now if she doesn't want me to go shoot.
[45:59.400 --> 46:02.300]  She would say you an idiot. Why would you go
[46:02.300 --> 46:04.300]  on Mother's Day? But she told us to go but we
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.200]  didn't and instead I watched it on TV and this
[46:08.200 --> 46:10.000]  is the best thing friend of the show Matthew
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.500]  Panzareno was in New York at the time. They're
[46:13.500 --> 46:17.000]  having TechCrunch disrupt and Monday morning
[46:17.500 --> 46:19.700]  his first the first day of the conference. He
[46:19.700 --> 46:22.800]  had an interview with Derek Jeter and his
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.300]  co-founder of the website the Players Tribune
[46:25.900 --> 46:30.300]  and Matthew invited me up to you know to come
[46:30.300 --> 46:33.000]  see it at backstage passes and I got one for
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.900]  Jonas as well. So we played hooky. He missed
[46:35.900 --> 46:38.300]  school unfortunately, and we took the train up
[46:38.300 --> 46:41.900]  to New York saw Matthews excellent interview
[46:41.900 --> 46:44.300]  with Derek Jeter and then Jonas and I met him
[46:44.400 --> 46:47.500]  backstage. Oh good for you. It was great. He's
[46:47.500 --> 46:50.900]  very very very nice man. Very handsome. God is
[46:50.900 --> 46:55.700]  he handsome. Jesus. He's not as handsome as I
[46:55.700 --> 46:58.500]  am. I mean, let's be honest. I don't know Jim.
[46:58.500 --> 47:00.900]  I don't know what I'm around you. Well, yeah,
[47:00.900 --> 47:03.100]  that's what you tell people his hands are softer
[47:03.100 --> 47:08.900]  than yours as well. I have to say I don't even
[47:08.900 --> 47:11.000]  know what to say about that Derek Jeter has
[47:11.000 --> 47:13.700]  very soft hands. I like to have skin. I don't
[47:13.700 --> 47:16.500]  know what to say. I'm in tea and leather. Yeah,
[47:17.500 --> 47:23.200]  Jeter and like I must say that I did watch
[47:23.200 --> 47:26.300]  that because obviously, you know, he's a very
[47:26.300 --> 47:31.500]  important man in the sport and I was I was
[47:31.500 --> 47:35.700]  touched gotta say I you know, looking at the
[47:35.700 --> 47:39.800]  people in the crowd. They were crying, you know,
[47:39.800 --> 47:45.800]  they were they were proud. They were sad, you
[47:45.800 --> 47:47.900]  know, they they understood what he meant for
[47:47.900 --> 47:51.500]  the team. Yeah, and he just had that sort of
[47:51.500 --> 47:54.100]  magical career where it just always seemed to
[47:54.100 --> 47:56.700]  go right for him up, you know, up until that
[47:56.700 --> 48:00.200]  bloop single in the world's 2001 World Series
[48:00.200 --> 48:02.700]  that went over his head. But even then it's
[48:02.700 --> 48:04.000]  like even when they lost the World Series,
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  they had to lose it in like the most spectacular
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.100]  fashion possible. Yeah, a broken bat bloop single
[48:10.100 --> 48:12.700]  over over the shortstop right after they, you
[48:12.700 --> 48:14.760]  know, had him come in to play a close grand
[48:14.760 --> 48:18.200]  ball. It was it was great and Yankee fans
[48:18.200 --> 48:20.100]  certainly appreciate that sort of thing. Yeah.
[48:22.300 --> 48:24.900]  All right back to WWDC. Yeah, so I don't think
[48:24.900 --> 48:26.600]  we'll see hardware on Apple Watch. There's
[48:26.600 --> 48:28.900]  rampant rumors though that we might see new
[48:28.900 --> 48:33.400]  iPad hardware. What do you think about that?
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.300]  That wouldn't surprise me at all because I
[48:37.300 --> 48:41.200]  would say primarily it's just been so long,
[48:41.300 --> 48:44.100]  right? So the the the 12.9 inch the big iPad
[48:44.100 --> 48:49.000]  Pro came out in September of 2015. So it's
[48:49.200 --> 48:53.800]  over a year and a half old and the regular sized
[48:53.900 --> 48:57.700]  iPad Pro came out last March April around
[48:57.700 --> 49:03.300]  around then so it's a little over a year. It's
[49:03.300 --> 49:05.500]  just crying for an update and if it doesn't
[49:05.500 --> 49:09.500]  come out at WWDC that pushes it to the fall and
[49:09.500 --> 49:11.300]  I just don't think that they would want to do
[49:11.300 --> 49:13.500]  that. I think if they can announce it at WWDC
[49:13.500 --> 49:18.700]  they will I think updates to the iPad make
[49:18.700 --> 49:24.400]  perfect sense for the hardware that will be at
[49:24.400 --> 49:28.600]  the event. And you know the rumor and but
[49:28.600 --> 49:30.600]  nothing is really leaked. I mean rumors have
[49:30.600 --> 49:32.900]  leaked but there's no like here's a picture
[49:32.900 --> 49:36.500]  of what the new iPad looks like but the rumors
[49:36.500 --> 49:39.300]  are that it's it's sort of the same footprint
[49:39.500 --> 49:42.200]  device but with a screen that's bigger that
[49:42.200 --> 49:44.700]  goes edge to edge, you know that that eliminates
[49:44.700 --> 49:48.600]  the chin and forehead as as I call them. Some
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.400]  of the rumors suggest that only the 10 point
[49:51.600 --> 49:54.300]  something inch one is going to ship. I find
[49:54.300 --> 49:57.600]  that hard to believe unless unbeknownst to
[49:57.600 --> 50:00.300]  all of us the 12.9 inch iPad is sort of a
[50:00.300 --> 50:02.500]  flop. I mean if they don't have an update to
[50:02.500 --> 50:04.900]  the one that hasn't come out since September
[50:04.900 --> 50:09.200]  2015 it it would say to me that maybe they're
[50:09.300 --> 50:13.100]  they're done with that size iPad. I mean I
[50:13.100 --> 50:14.800]  can't imagine why they would update the smaller
[50:14.800 --> 50:16.500]  one before they do the other one. I think they
[50:16.500 --> 50:18.700]  should update them together and it makes total
[50:18.700 --> 50:21.000]  sense to me given how much more expensive iPad
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.200]  pros are than regular just plain iPads that
[50:25.200 --> 50:27.700]  they would want them to look different to and
[50:27.700 --> 50:29.800]  this reduction in bezel would be a way to do
[50:29.800 --> 50:32.000]  that where you look like you've got a more
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.600]  pro iPad because it's got this cooler edge
[50:34.600 --> 50:38.700]  to edge screen. That is my favorite one to be
[50:38.700 --> 50:44.700]  on the the the the pro. Yeah, the big no the
[50:44.700 --> 50:47.200]  smaller pro. Yeah, that's my favorite smaller
[50:47.200 --> 50:49.900]  pro is my favorite and and I'll be honest with
[50:49.900 --> 50:53.800]  you. A lot of it is because of that true tone
[50:54.100 --> 50:57.200]  technology with the screen. I can see that
[50:57.200 --> 51:00.300]  thing outside in the sun. Yeah, and I'm still
[51:00.300 --> 51:02.800]  I still walk around with my phone turning so
[51:02.800 --> 51:05.600]  that it's in the shade, you know, so that I can
[51:05.600 --> 51:07.700]  see it properly. I wish they bring true tone
[51:07.700 --> 51:10.600]  to everything. I want you at my car in my eyeballs.
[51:11.400 --> 51:13.800]  I still remember when Schiller introduced it
[51:13.800 --> 51:16.400]  and he said once you once you get used to it,
[51:16.400 --> 51:18.600]  you can't go back and that made me think it
[51:18.600 --> 51:20.600]  was coming on the iPhone to last year and it
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.800]  did to me too. But it I was that's probably
[51:24.800 --> 51:26.100]  my biggest disappointment single biggest
[51:26.100 --> 51:28.500]  disappointment about the iPhone 7 is that it
[51:28.500 --> 51:30.800]  doesn't have true tone because it's such a
[51:30.800 --> 51:33.700]  nice effect agreed. I don't know. I don't
[51:33.700 --> 51:36.900]  know how they do it, but you can see the
[51:36.900 --> 51:40.600]  screen changing as you're moving into
[51:40.600 --> 51:43.800]  different areas and it just it really looks
[51:43.800 --> 51:46.000]  so much different and better and incandescent
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.800]  light, you know, it's I don't like I personally
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.900]  hate that feature personally. I'm not saying
[51:50.900 --> 51:53.000]  I'm disappointed that it's a feature in the
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.100]  OS but I hate that feature where it it changes
[51:56.100 --> 51:58.600]  the color of the screen at night. Yeah, the
[51:58.600 --> 52:03.200]  supposed help getting to sleep. What's that
[52:03.200 --> 52:05.100]  one called? I hate it. So I don't know the
[52:05.100 --> 52:07.700]  name of it. Night shift. Well night shift.
[52:07.700 --> 52:10.200]  Yeah. Yeah. I hate night shift. I and when
[52:10.200 --> 52:12.200]  I see somebody using a phone with night shift,
[52:12.200 --> 52:15.200]  I'm instantly I'm appalled. It looks to me
[52:15.200 --> 52:21.300]  like it's been sitting in like a hole in the
[52:21.300 --> 52:24.800]  wall bar for 30 years and it's just covered
[52:24.800 --> 52:31.200]  with nicotine stains works for to each his
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.900]  own and people, you know, some people swear
[52:32.900 --> 52:35.200]  by it but for people who haven't seen the
[52:35.200 --> 52:38.800]  iPad Pro with true tone, it sounds like it's
[52:38.800 --> 52:41.000]  the same thing where it shifts the colors
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.000]  based on the ambient colors of the light in
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.500]  the environment you are but it's nothing like
[52:46.500 --> 52:48.900]  night shift because for me night shift, you
[52:48.900 --> 52:50.600]  know, you when you look at night shift, it
[52:50.600 --> 52:52.400]  doesn't make the screen look right. It makes
[52:52.400 --> 52:54.800]  the screen look different and I personally
[52:54.800 --> 52:57.800]  find it distasteful people who like it that
[52:57.800 --> 52:59.900]  they find it easy on your eyes at night. They
[52:59.900 --> 53:02.900]  know that it's on though. Whereas true tone
[53:02.900 --> 53:04.400]  once you get used to it, you don't know that
[53:04.400 --> 53:06.500]  it's there. It just makes the screen look
[53:06.500 --> 53:10.100]  quote unquote right in all lighting environment.
[53:10.100 --> 53:15.100]  Yeah, and you can you can take the iPad with
[53:15.100 --> 53:18.700]  true tone outside and if you watch carefully
[53:18.700 --> 53:20.800]  I find it better coming from outside the
[53:20.800 --> 53:23.100]  inside if you watch carefully on the screen
[53:23.100 --> 53:26.100]  you can see not the screen dim or not the
[53:26.100 --> 53:29.400]  screen get brighter but actually change the
[53:29.400 --> 53:31.800]  way that it's displaying things to you. So
[53:31.800 --> 53:35.800]  when if you take an older iPad outside and
[53:35.800 --> 53:39.000]  set it in the sun and try and do something
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.200]  you can't really see the screen right, but
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.400]  the one with true tone you can see it just
[53:43.400 --> 53:45.500]  as if you were inside. Well, and then the
[53:45.500 --> 53:48.000]  other thing too is when I compare it like
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.800]  Amy uses a 9.7 inch iPad Pro a lot. It's
[53:51.800 --> 53:56.800]  like her favorite computing device. And she
[53:56.800 --> 53:59.100]  uses it at night and then I see her screen
[53:59.100 --> 54:00.600]  and then I look at my iPhone screen and
[54:00.600 --> 54:03.400]  my iPhone screen suddenly looks like you
[54:03.400 --> 54:07.900]  know, like the colors look off. Yeah. Yeah,
[54:07.900 --> 54:11.700]  I I I definitely want to I think I've had
[54:11.700 --> 54:14.700]  hardware at WWDC. I I'm not going to call it
[54:14.700 --> 54:16.200]  a sure thing because I don't feel like
[54:16.200 --> 54:18.000]  anything is a sure thing with with as much
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.400]  secrecy as they've maintained around their
[54:20.400 --> 54:23.800]  stuff, but it certainly is overdue and I
[54:23.800 --> 54:26.200]  would really like to see both two sizes of
[54:26.200 --> 54:29.200]  iPad Pros with these new edge to edge screens.
[54:29.200 --> 54:30.600]  I'd like to see the regular size and I want
[54:30.600 --> 54:36.200]  to see the big size that to me is is the
[54:36.200 --> 54:38.200]  one that makes the most sense. Of course
[54:38.200 --> 54:40.200]  outside of the software if we're looking
[54:40.200 --> 54:42.400]  at hardware that is the one that makes the
[54:42.400 --> 54:44.700]  most sense to me. I would like to see a
[54:44.700 --> 54:48.300]  significant Improvement to the smart keyboard
[54:48.300 --> 54:51.600]  cover as well. Yeah, I don't mind typing
[54:51.600 --> 54:54.200]  on that thing, but I think it could be better
[54:54.200 --> 54:56.800]  it when I first looked at it. I was like
[54:56.800 --> 54:58.600]  I'm going to hate that and then when I
[54:58.600 --> 55:00.100]  actually tried using it I was like this
[55:00.100 --> 55:03.600]  is actually a little better than I thought
[55:03.600 --> 55:05.100]  but I feel like there's so much room for
[55:05.100 --> 55:12.000]  improvement. I I don't understand why the
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.300]  keys on the the cover are so small. I know
[55:16.300 --> 55:17.600]  I know exactly what you mean. Why not
[55:17.600 --> 55:19.600]  make them bigger and make them closer to
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.000]  each other? Yeah, it just it they have
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.600]  those beautiful keyboards, you know on
[55:27.600 --> 55:30.600]  the MacBook Pros if they would take that
[55:30.600 --> 55:33.200]  put it on a smart cover. I would love it
[55:33.200 --> 55:35.600]  even if it made the cover thicker and it
[55:35.600 --> 55:38.500]  doesn't matter. All right, but I don't I
[55:38.500 --> 55:40.000]  don't think that it would make the cover
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.100]  thicker. I mean the keys are pretty high
[55:42.100 --> 55:44.900]  as it is. Here's here's here's an out
[55:44.900 --> 55:48.500]  there idea that would make me more likely
[55:48.500 --> 55:52.200]  to do more on an iPad as work would be
[55:52.200 --> 55:54.900]  if they added a trackpad to the smart
[55:54.900 --> 55:58.200]  keyboard cover. Yeah, and my idea for
[55:58.200 --> 56:01.700]  them adding a trackpad would not be of
[56:01.700 --> 56:05.700]  course not adding a mouse arrow on screen
[56:06.100 --> 56:08.700]  an arrow pointer that you could tap all
[56:08.700 --> 56:10.800]  around the screen and make it like a Mac.
[56:10.800 --> 56:13.000]  No, because that's the whole difference.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.700]  You know, the Mac is an arrow mouse
[56:15.700 --> 56:18.100]  pointer based graphical user interface.
[56:18.100 --> 56:21.900]  The iPad is a direct touch interface just
[56:21.900 --> 56:24.900]  for text editing in the exact same way
[56:24.900 --> 56:27.500]  that iOS already supports force touch on
[56:27.500 --> 56:30.400]  the iPhone for moving the cursor around
[56:30.400 --> 56:32.600]  like like a mouse like a trackpad. Yeah,
[56:33.100 --> 56:35.000]  and somebody on Twitter today. I forget
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.900]  who I'm sorry, but somebody pointed out
[56:37.900 --> 56:40.700]  that that the force touch on the on the
[56:40.700 --> 56:44.200]  keyboard on iPhone to move the insertion
[56:44.200 --> 56:46.200]  point around just like a trackpad on
[56:46.200 --> 56:49.900]  Mac is their single favorite force touch
[56:49.900 --> 56:51.900]  feature on the iPhone and I completely
[56:51.900 --> 56:53.900]  agree and so and every time I mentioned
[56:53.900 --> 56:56.200]  it it's one of those features that's not
[56:56.200 --> 56:58.200]  obvious because you can't look to assume
[56:58.200 --> 56:59.800]  it's there. I guarantee you there are
[56:59.800 --> 57:01.400]  people listening to the show right now
[57:01.400 --> 57:02.500]  who are like what the hell is he talking
[57:02.500 --> 57:03.700]  about and then they're going to take out
[57:03.700 --> 57:07.000]  their iPhone. So go to like a note or an
[57:07.000 --> 57:08.400]  email where you're writing an email
[57:08.400 --> 57:10.300]  bring up the keyboard and then force
[57:10.300 --> 57:11.700]  touch on the keyboard and drag your
[57:11.700 --> 57:13.900]  finger around and you'll see the little
[57:13.900 --> 57:15.700]  insertion point on screen move around
[57:15.700 --> 57:18.200]  just like a mouse pointer. I would love
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.000]  to see them add that to the to the smart
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.100]  keyboard cover just for text editing
[57:23.100 --> 57:25.200]  everything else you still tap the screen.
[57:25.200 --> 57:28.600]  I guess the other thing that maybe the
[57:28.600 --> 57:29.900]  trackpad could be used for would be
[57:29.900 --> 57:33.500]  scrolling but not a mouse pointer
[57:33.500 --> 57:35.400]  scrolling you know like two-finger touch
[57:35.400 --> 57:37.300]  on the trackpad for scrolling of views
[57:37.300 --> 57:39.200]  that you you don't have to reach your
[57:39.200 --> 57:41.600]  arm out to scroll and I think that would
[57:41.600 --> 57:44.200]  be cool to everything but the mouse
[57:44.200 --> 57:48.400]  pointer and then just use it for moving
[57:48.400 --> 57:50.100]  the insertion point. I find that would
[57:50.100 --> 57:51.800]  be it would make text editing so much
[57:51.800 --> 57:55.200]  faster like I find it so hard to select
[57:55.200 --> 57:59.700]  text on an iPad I really do. Yeah I'm
[57:59.700 --> 58:01.900]  trying to think space wise how you would
[58:01.900 --> 58:03.300]  do that I'm trying to make the keys
[58:03.300 --> 58:10.100]  bigger. Well I think you'd set it up like
[58:10.100 --> 58:12.400]  a MacBook where the keys are up top by
[58:12.400 --> 58:14.600]  the base of the iPad and underneath
[58:14.600 --> 58:16.200]  there's underneath the spacebar there's
[58:16.200 --> 58:18.700]  a little little trackpad. Yeah you
[58:18.700 --> 58:20.700]  wouldn't need a big trackpad. No just a
[58:20.700 --> 58:24.100]  little one. I would make me I think it
[58:24.100 --> 58:26.400]  would make people who who work on iPads
[58:26.400 --> 58:28.200]  so happy. I mean there's things that I
[58:28.200 --> 58:32.400]  I've taken for granted on the Mac since
[58:32.400 --> 58:35.400]  I first used a Mac in the 80s you know
[58:35.400 --> 58:37.700]  where you can just put your mouse in a
[58:37.700 --> 58:40.000]  point in a paragraph and triple-click
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.100]  and get a get the whole paragraph
[58:42.100 --> 58:46.700]  selected right right like to double
[58:46.700 --> 58:49.200]  click on a word with the mouse pointer
[58:49.200 --> 58:52.200]  it's so much faster to me than selecting
[58:52.200 --> 58:55.500]  a word in with the finger or if you want
[58:55.500 --> 58:57.900]  to select two words like if I've got
[58:57.900 --> 59:00.900]  Jim space Dalrymple to just double I
[59:00.900 --> 59:01.900]  don't even think about it I just
[59:01.900 --> 59:03.900]  double-click on Jim and then drag over
[59:03.900 --> 59:06.000]  you know hold on the double-click drag
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  over to Dalrymple and as soon as I hit
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  the D and Dalrymple I've got both words
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.900]  selected exactly no surrounding spaces
[59:13.900 --> 59:16.200]  and they're ready to be copied or pasted
[59:16.200 --> 59:17.900]  or I guess if it says Jim Dalrymple
[59:17.900 --> 59:29.000]  deleted. Do you think that Apple would do that or are
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.900]  they that rid are they too resistant to
[59:30.900 --> 59:33.400]  the to the difference between touch and
[59:33.400 --> 59:38.400]  trackpad iOS versus Mac? I mean they've
[59:38.400 --> 59:41.500]  they've been very clear up until now
[59:41.500 --> 59:43.900]  that they don't they don't seem to want
[59:43.900 --> 59:49.400]  the iPad to look anything like or act
[59:49.400 --> 59:51.500]  anything like a I think that if you
[59:51.500 --> 59:53.500]  don't add a mouse pointer on screen
[59:53.500 --> 59:54.800]  other than when you're moving the
[59:54.800 --> 59:57.000]  insertion point around and as soon as
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.200]  you're done moving it it just could you
[59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.300]  know the blinking cursor let's go where
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:05.400]  you let go I think it could be done I
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.400]  think that the iPad could gain a
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.200]  trackpad and not not really become
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.300]  mac-like in any way it would just have
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.800]  some conveniences of trackpad support
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.500]  in a way that the Mac can't just add
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.400]  touch and and you know what I mean it's
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.200]  easier for the iOS to get up for the
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.900]  iPad to get more like a Mac than for the
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.600]  Mac to get more like an iPad is what I'm
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:29.200]  trying to say yeah without losing what
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.500]  it is that makes each one good on its
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:36.000]  own I would I have no idea again this is
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.100]  none of this stuff not one thing I'm
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.500]  talking about today is like a rumor that
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.000]  I've heard from little birdies or
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.700]  anything I've heard nothing and I don't
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.200]  want to know I'm hoping to go into this
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.800]  keynote totally surprised so this is
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.900]  just me speculating but I see it on
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.900]  Twitter all the time when I write about
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.700]  these things like from doing fireball
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.300]  readers that people do know this idea of
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.400]  having trackpad support just for text
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.700]  editing and maybe like scrolling on the
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:01.300]  iPad is something an awful lot of people
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.600]  would like to see yeah no I agree I
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.600]  agree because what I tend to use the
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.900]  iPad for a lot is text editing you know
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.100]  research reading typing out little notes
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.000]  stuff like that so I would love to see
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.300]  something like that and it does support
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.100]  text like making selections with the
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.000]  keyboard you know like where you can you
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.500]  know use the arrow keys to get the
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.900]  insertion point right where you want it
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.900]  and hold down shift to make a selection
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.100]  and hold down shift and option to select
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:34.500]  words at a time but you know what most
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.200]  people don't know those shortcuts yeah
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.400]  and whereas people do know how to select
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.600]  words double-click on words and
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.100]  triple-click on paragraphs with a mouse
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:49.300]  pointer I am what and I still want the
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.900]  keys bigger what about all right what
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.200]  about the iPad mini board genius report
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.900]  Jonathan Geller reported last week that
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.500]  he's heard from a source at Apple that
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.900]  the iPad mini is going to be
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.600]  discontinued but that whether that means
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.200]  that we're just haven't you know I think
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.000]  if that's true if and I I don't know I'm
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.900]  just saying if it's true I don't think
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.900]  it means that they're going to stop
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.400]  selling the iPad mini I think they're
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.500]  going to do what they've done with the
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.300]  MacBook Air with it and just keep
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.200]  selling the MacBook mini as it is until
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:25.700]  people stop buying it I okay I do like
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:31.800]  the I the iPad mini but I use the nine
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.700]  point seven much more I love the iPad
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.400]  mini but it's it's hit me right in the
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.100]  as I'm I meant that I've talked about
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.200]  this before but it at the point now
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.600]  where I need reading glasses when I have
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.200]  my contacts in it's exactly on schedule
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.600]  for a mid 40s person who's near-sighted
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.500]  like all of a sudden I need it the fact
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.200]  that the iPad mini is the same interface
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.600]  as the pixel for pixel the same
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.300]  interface as the nine point seven inch
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.400]  iPad just smaller makes it it's hard for
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.200]  me to read at this point I love it
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.200]  though and when I was younger and in
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.700]  honestly the way that that presbyopia
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.900]  comes on for those you too young to have
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.300]  it yet it happens very fast you're I
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.700]  know you're going through the same thing
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.300]  yeah and it had you agree it's like one
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.400]  year you see perfectly at reading
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.100]  distance just like you did when you're
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.900]  in your teens and your 20s and your 30s
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.600]  and then all of a sudden like one year
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.500]  later it's like you can't read this
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.900]  distance and you have to hold it out and
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.100]  then two years later it's like I can't
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.900]  read this at all that's happened to me
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.900]  in between when the iPad mini first
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.100]  appeared and today like when the iPad
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.500]  mini first appeared I had no trouble
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.100]  reading it and I loved it I loved it
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.000]  because of the size I really really
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.900]  loved it and so personally I'm I don't
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.200]  really care because I don't think I
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.800]  would ever buy an iPad mini again
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.700]  personally because I want the bigger I
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.100]  want I want I want everything bigger I
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:06.800]  need it bigger yeah you know yeah I'll
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.100]  say yeah I'll go as far as you I need it
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.100]  bigger when I when I travel though I
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:17.400]  always take my my 9.7 if I'm at home
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.900]  I'll use the the larger one but given
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.000]  the choice it's that 9.7 Pro but if my
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.700]  eyes were better I would I would still
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.100]  be used I would still prefer the iPad
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.700]  mini so if I were younger or just had
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.600]  better eyesight at this point I'd be
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.600]  disappointed by this news I wonder what
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.100]  the demographic is of people in general
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.600]  buying iPads when I don't know they're
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.600]  younger you know what I noticed I just
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.800]  bought a speaking it's all kind of
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.900]  related it all comes full circle Jim so
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.100]  I got a new prescription for glasses
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.900]  from my eye doctor for when I'm wearing
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.900]  my contacts when I wear contact lenses
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.200]  I need reading glasses and when I wear
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.600]  my regular prescription glasses I need
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.500]  to take my glasses off to see up close
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.900]  does that make sense to you yeah okay
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.900]  so one way or the other all day every
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.800]  day I'm taking glasses on and off I can
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.600]  either have them have prescription
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.600]  glasses on to see it distance and take
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.400]  them off to read or I can wear my
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.100]  contact lenses and see everything at
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.400]  distance fine but have to put reading
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.200]  glasses on to read long story short so
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.000]  for my reading glasses while I'm wearing
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.200]  contact lenses my eye doctor gave me a
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.100]  new prescription which is a little
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.500]  different like it you know a lot of
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.900]  people buy the reading glasses just in
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.200]  the drugstore you can get them for like
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.000]  six bucks right I wanted to get and I've
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.700]  been using those just to sort of
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.500]  experiment cheaply but I got a new pair
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.400]  of reading glasses and I wanted to get a
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.700]  decent pair of glasses since I use them
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.800]  all the time now so I got Warby Parker's
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.200]  they said they're not sponsoring this
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.700]  episode of the show but we have a nice
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.800]  new just opened a couple months ago
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.400]  Warby Parker boutique here in
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.900]  Philadelphia that's just a few blocks
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.000]  from from where I live and so I went to
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.500]  their actual store to see what it was
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.900]  like and got these glasses there and
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.100]  what I noticed was that every single
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.700]  salesperson in the store walks around
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.200]  with an iPad mini and that's how they do
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.000]  their checkout like adults you know when
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.100]  you say hey I'd like to get these
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.900]  glasses here's my prescription and they
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.200]  save you for black glasses from us
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.800]  before and they you know log you out
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.800]  that what they have in their hand is an
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.000]  iPad mini huh and I think it's perfect
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  for the task I feel like and it's a lot
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.300]  less conspicuous than walking around
[01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.100]  with a bigger iPad it's a little lighter
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:38.200]  and I've seen them too as square cash
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.600]  readers a lot of places you know like
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.100]  when people set up square cashes that
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.300]  check out and I but I wonder if it's
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.700]  because the mini is small or is it just
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.800]  because they bought the cheapest
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.100]  possible iPad because it's just going to
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.600]  be a card reader and at the time the
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.500]  mini was the cheapest possible iPad and
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.700]  now that there's the new 9.7 inch iPad
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.100]  at a lowest the lowest price in the
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.000]  lineup they'll just buy that instead I
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.500]  don't think so I think the mini works
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.800]  perfect for that type of situation and I
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.500]  kind of you know I I feel like the
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500]  situations where the mini works it makes
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500]  sense that they they don't need to
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.900]  update it like it would be nice but if
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.200]  they're selling it in kind of low
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.300]  quantities like this is obviously not
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.300]  the biggest selling iPad because if it
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.700]  were they just update it but in selling
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.300]  in quantities enough that it makes sense
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.100]  to keep it around even if they don't
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.500]  update the config it makes sense it
[01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.000]  might be around for years to come I
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.500]  don't know yeah yeah and they already
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.100]  have it up to sort of the baseline level
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.500]  of modern Apple iOS hardware where it
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.300]  has touch ID support it has a retina
[01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:47.200]  screen what do you think the their
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.700]  thought is the iPhone is getting bigger
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.900]  and kind of encroaching on where the
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.900]  mini is or the fact that people just
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.700]  aren't buying the mini I I think it has
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.700]  something to do I well I don't think
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.100]  it's what Apple's thinking I think it's
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.600]  what customers are thinking and I think
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.200]  Apple's you know customers do the
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.400]  thinking and what they sell or what they
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.400]  buy Apple makes more of and updates and
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.600]  I think what customers are probably
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:19.100]  thinking is they like that I think most
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:21.200]  I think more people like the 9.7 inch
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.900]  iPad I think Apple got that right right
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:27.200]  in 2010 when the first one came out like
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.200]  they got the size right yeah of this is
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.100]  this is the best size for the device
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.800]  that we're thinking of calling the iPad
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.000]  I think they nailed it and I think it's
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.200]  still true to this day and I think the
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.300]  fact that for people who kind of want a
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:46.200]  more handheld size thing the this the
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:49.600]  plus-size phones are so are not so close
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.300]  I mean there's definitely a difference
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.800]  between an iPad mini and a iPhone 7 plus
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.200]  but it's close enough though that
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.500]  somebody who has a 7 plus is not going
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.600]  to buy an iPad mini yeah I'd agree with
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:05.500]  that and once they get rid of the what
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.800]  did you call them the chin and the
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.900]  forehead yeah that's gonna make it's
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.100]  gonna make it seem even yeah well I
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.600]  suppose it will be but I do think the
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]  current pricing lineup is a little weird
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.400]  for the iPad because it there's like a
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.900]  big gap between the the 9.7 inch just
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.300]  playing iPad the one that just came out
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.700]  a few months ago and the entry-level
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.500]  iPad Pro like there's there's no middle
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500]  range in the iPad lineup anymore like it
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500]  used to be the mini was the low-end
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.900]  price the 9.7 inch what they used to
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:46.500]  call the iPad air was the mid-range and
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.900]  then the iPad Pro was the high-end but
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.200]  instead they don't really have a
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.700]  mid-range anymore because they dropped
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.700]  the price on the 9.7 inch iPad below the
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:10:00.700]  price of the iPad Pro right if you look
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.500]  at the 32 gigabyte models or the entry
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.400]  level models the the cheapest mini iPad
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.900]  mini is a 399 iPad with 128 gigabytes
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:14.500]  and then to get the regular iPad you can
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.900]  get one for 329 which is a lower price
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.700]  but it only has 32 gigabytes and then
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:21.500]  the 128 model which is probably the
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.400]  better model for most people 32 is pretty
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:26.700]  pretty slim is 429 so for only 30 bucks
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.800]  more you can get the the new iPad
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.300]  instead of the iPad mini for that's a
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.900]  that's a hell of a deal I mean that seems
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.300]  it just doesn't it sort of defies the
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.200]  hey you get a discount for buying a
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:41.800]  small iPad so for it seems like they're
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.200]  pushing people towards that right and
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.200]  then the next one up is a 32 gigabyte 9.7
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.100]  inch iPad Pro it jumps all the way to
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:53.100]  599 you go from 429 to 600 bucks and at
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.400]  at 128 gigs for the 128 gig config which
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.100]  for the pro I think most people are
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.700]  going to want because if you really are
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.300]  thinking about using the iPad in a use
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.100]  case where you don't need a lot of
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.500]  storage or you're not going to put a lot
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.300]  of apps on it you're not going to get a
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.200]  pro anyway you're going to get the just
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.700]  play an iPad so for the 128 it goes to
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.100]  699 it's 700 bucks yeah that's it almost
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:20.400]  it's at least it was it to to so $270
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.000]  difference between the 9.7 inch iPad and
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  a 9.7 inch iPad Pro at 128 gigabytes I
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.800]  that that seems like too big of a gap so
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.800]  and I it just makes me think that
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.800]  whatever they're going to announce the
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.000]  WWDC is going to fill in some of the
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.500]  gaps in that pricing like maybe what
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.400]  they'll do is introduce these new iPad
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.800]  pros with the chin and forehead gone and
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.600]  keep the prices that we have right now
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.400]  for iPad pros and then keep some of the
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.600]  older iPad pros that are on sale today
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.700]  and look keep them in the lineup in that
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:59.100]  mid-range price range that's what that
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.700]  would be my bet as to what Apple does
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:05.200]  yeah and and there's rumors of the new
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.400]  size right yeah well the new size though
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.800]  is I it's a screen size not a device
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.500]  size I think what that means is when
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.200]  they take the chin and forehead away
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200]  they instead of making the device
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.600]  smaller they just fill it in with a
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.700]  slightly bigger screen hmm and that
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.200]  stacked it on top of each other it might
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.800]  be about the same size physically so
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.600]  what's that going to do to the graphics
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.000]  and everything nothing I think there's
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.400]  I think this is going to spread it out
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.700]  yeah I think that the these the
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.900]  graphics on these iPads are done that
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:39.300]  the a 10 series chips it doesn't even
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.200]  break a sweat yeah yeah I think since
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.200]  what about apps will affect them in any
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.100]  yeah I think that they'll need to be you
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.700]  know but I think if they're using the
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.900]  size classes right and and the apps that
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.600]  have already been written to adjust to
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:56.600]  iPad split-screen multitasking you know
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.100]  where you no longer make assumptions
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.200]  about you that you have the whole screen
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.900]  right you might be 50 50 you might be
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.400]  two-thirds one-third I think apps that
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.000]  are already adjusted that will adjust to
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.400]  the new size easily okay and and if they
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.900]  don't you know I'm sure they'll have a
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.600]  mode in where apps that haven't been
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.400]  updated by their developers will just
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.400]  run in a stretch mode or something like
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.000]  that or maybe like letterboxed or
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  something like that do you use that
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  split-screen I don't use an iPad enough
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.500]  but when I do use an iPad I definitely
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.100]  use the split-screen hmm I found that to
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.400]  be very helpful it's one of those
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.200]  features I talked about earlier with
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.900]  unlocking your Mac that you know you
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.100]  just once you get used to using you kind
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:47.000]  of really love yeah you know one thing I
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.600]  definitely do on the iPad is I want I
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.900]  will watch baseball games and it's nice
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:59.600]  to have the baseball game running while
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.400]  you're still paying attention to like a
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.600]  slack conversation or an iMessage or
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.900]  something like that and you don't have
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.600]  to leave the game you can just you know
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.300]  you can just chat with somebody while
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.800]  you're watching the game it's yeah you
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.500]  know I definitely use it I think it
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.800]  could be improved though and which leads
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.400]  me to the next topic but I will I will
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:19.100]  hold that until I do another sponsor
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.100]  break to thank our next sponsor it's

[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.900]  frame they look great at the smaller

[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.700]  fracture for sponsoring the show good
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.300]  friends of the show all right here's my
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.700]  next topic Jim you led right into it I
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.900]  think that iOS is overdue for iPad
[01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:50.200]  specific features I heard there were
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.500]  rumors last year that there was slated
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.200]  for iOS 10 and was one of those things
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.900]  like I mentioned earlier in the show
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.600]  that wasn't ready in time and therefore
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.100]  didn't make the cut and I think I think
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:06.500]  it's I think it's overdue to be there
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.100]  this year and I think it I think it
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.300]  might be a big part of the WWDC keynote
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:15.300]  so if if we we both agree that hardware
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:19.900]  wise iPad makes sense then they could
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.300]  really make a big splash by having
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:26.100]  software only yep features on iPad as
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.500]  well yeah because it you know to state
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.400]  the obvious there's an awful lot that
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.700]  the iPhone and iPad share and there's an
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.900]  awful lot of there's some benefits to
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:37.700]  the fact that they share an operating
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.500]  system and that you can have these
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.700]  universal apps that the same app you
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.600]  know runs on your phone it runs on iPad
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.500]  and they share a lot of things but
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.100]  there's one very obvious thing that's
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.600]  very different about the iPad than the
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.500]  iPhone which is that has a humongous
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.800]  screen compared to the iPhone and an
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.300]  awful lot of ways a in little ways in
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.800]  like a hundred little paper cuts here
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.100]  and there the fact that iOS started
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:07.300]  life as a phone OS and the phone is
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:11.600]  still the the primary you know product
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.800]  of the entire company it makes the iPad
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.200]  suffer in a hundred little ways that if
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.800]  the iPad were the Apple's only product
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.500]  or if the tables were turned and it was
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.800]  the iPad that sold 70 million units a
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.900]  quarter and the iPhone that sold 9 10
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.500]  million a quarter iOS would be way
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.100]  better on the iPad yeah this is no doubt
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.900]  about it right yeah absolutely did you
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.800]  read Federico Viticis piece last week
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.000]  it's like almost like a little book
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.700]  length yeah I know what he hoped to see
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:50.500]  in iOS 11 and boy I loved it and a lot
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.300]  of times con I don't like concept videos
[01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.400]  like that like why waste the time on
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.600]  that because most of the time when
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.100]  people make concept videos they're so
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.500]  far out there that they're not there's
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.000]  no way that you could actually build it
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.400]  today whereas everything Federico
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.500]  imagined is completely feasible there's
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.900]  not one idea he has that is like pie in
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.900]  the sky well yeah that would be nice but
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:17.100]  you how the hell would that work and an
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.900]  awful lot of his ideas revolve around
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.900]  multitasking having two things on screen
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.000]  multiple things on screen and being able
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  to do things that on the Mac you just
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.700]  take for granted like if you have a file
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.600]  on your desktop and you want to send it
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.700]  in a message you just click on it and
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.900]  drag it into the message yeah yeah I'm
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.800]  I mean I laugh but I mean it's things
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.400]  like that that that keep me from really
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.200]  even feasibly even thinking of being a
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.200]  full-time iPad user like it would just
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.200]  drive me nuts yeah I can see the one
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.500]  thing right here and you can't drag it
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.100]  to the other thing that you see at the
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.700]  same time on screen it feels broken
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:00.800]  right yeah I know I I agree I agree
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.100]  wholeheartedly and I don't think that
[01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:06.200]  there's anybody in in our community that
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.600]  really uses the iPad like Federico does
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.700]  no that's you know I when I blinked to
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.100]  it I said like that the best thing about
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.400]  it isn't any specific idea but it's the
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:17.700]  genuine passion and love for the
[01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.100]  platform that pervades his writing about
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:24.200]  it like he sees a potential for the iPad
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.900]  that I I personally don't and and it's
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.900]  you know it's why I really enjoyed
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.300]  reading his piece where I was like I
[01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:32.400]  think he's onto something here that that
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.900]  this really could be a lot better for
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.200]  typical day-to-day productivity well and
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.700]  I think that's you know you touched on
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.900]  it at the beginning of this segment that
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.000]  you know iOS would be different and
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.200]  better on the iPad if it if that's what
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:53.200]  it was made for but you know having
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.400]  iPhone be the the main thing it makes a
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:01.800]  lot more difficult yeah there is a
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.700]  there's a too many chefs spoiled the
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.700]  stew aspect that you know you can't just
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:10.900]  throw engineers at a problem and money
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:12.700]  at a problem and get it done faster I
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:17.200]  mean it's the famous you know
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.400]  programming adage that that if you throw
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.700]  more engineers at an overdue programming
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.400]  project it actually makes it even later
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.200]  because you waste more time in the
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.900]  collaboration between the programmers
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.000]  then you get you know it's it's not like
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.100]  painting a house where you can have more
[01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:38.900]  painters get the job done faster right
[01:21:38.900 --> 01:21:43.400]  but it Apple is of I don't know if
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:44.800]  you've heard this gym but Apple is
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:49.500]  financially successful company and it's
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.400]  you know III think expecting the iPad to
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.600]  advance at a fast rate is not
[01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.700]  unreasonable for a company with with
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:01.000]  their resources and it given what they
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.800]  say about the iPad you know and that
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.000]  they say that this is the future of
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.700]  personal computing and stuff like that I
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.600]  think that they they need to put their
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.700]  money where their mouth is and and make
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.700]  it happen I think part of the problem
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.800]  with the iPad though is that from from a
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.600]  consumer's perspective I think the
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.000]  consumer when they heard about tablets
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.800]  expected it to do more quicker than what
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.400]  it actually does you know Apple's very
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.200]  clear in in this is a touch interface
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.900]  and we're not going to do you know most
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:38.100]  on screen there's a Mac for that but I
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.200]  don't think as much as there's people in
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.500]  the 50-plus age group and the 20 and
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.300]  underage group that you know from kids
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.700]  to older people that love the iPad it's
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:53.800]  so that group in between that can't
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.300]  really get their head around how to use
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:00.400]  it yeah as a full-time thing so maybe
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:04.400]  Apple's actually waiting to see you know
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.100]  where this whole thing goes I mean yeah
[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:08.800]  they're selling millions are selling a
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:11.400]  lot less than what they used to but I
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.300]  just I think people are having a
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.100]  difficult time wrapping their head
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:18.000]  around it the book that I was thinking
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.300]  of is Frederick books Fred Brooks famous
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300]  book the mythical man month where the
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.800]  central theme of the book is that adding
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.700]  manpower to a late software project
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.200]  makes it later so if before anybody
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.800]  sends a correction to me or it says
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.900]  that's what you're thinking of that was
[01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:34.500]  the book anyway I think you're right you
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.300]  already you already got a hundred emails
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:40.900]  about that I put it in the show notes I
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:46.000]  did I swear there it is you can see it I
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.300]  think here's a little thing that I think
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.400]  is weird about the iPad and doesn't
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.700]  really make sense to me it if I am using
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:57.300]  a Mac and let's say I've got a Safari
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:01.700]  window and I've got a BB edit window and
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:04.900]  I'm writing in BB edit and I'm taking
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.200]  notes from the Safari thing and I can
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.900]  put the Safari window on the left and
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:11.000]  the BB edit window on the right and I
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.800]  can see them both side-by-side I can
[01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.900]  tell instantly which one currently has
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.900]  the focus because it looks different
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:24.400]  it's you know if I use the default
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.800]  colors it's got the red yellow green
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:27.500]  buttons instead of the desaturated
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.500]  buttons on the iPad when you're
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.300]  multitasking you can't really tell which
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:37.500]  one has focus and that bothers me and
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.200]  then the other thing is I don't really
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:40.900]  like the way that the iPad multitasking
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.900]  gives favored status to the left side
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.700]  like the left is the real app and the
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:49.100]  right even if you have it split 5050 is
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:51.600]  still sort of like a secondary app in
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.000]  some ways whereas on the Mac I could put
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  the Safari window on the left and the BB
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.600]  edit window on the right and if I change
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.500]  my mind I could put BB edit on the left
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.600]  and Safari on the right and it doesn't
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.000]  make any difference I don't understand
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.600]  why there's this you can't just treat
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.500]  both sides of split-screen on the iPad
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.300]  the same like it just seems to me like a
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.500]  UI concept that hasn't been thought
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.800]  through thoroughly or hasn't been
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.200]  implemented yeah and so I really love
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.000]  to see them take this idea of doing two
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.600]  apps or three apps or maybe four apps on
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:33.300]  the 12.9 inch iPad at the same time like
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.500]  wouldn't it be interesting if you could
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.900]  have four apps all running in narrow
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.400]  columns side-by-side on the iPad Pro I
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.800]  could think of context where that would
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.800]  be useful you have to think with
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.000]  everything that Apple tests and
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.900]  everything that they do that I mean they
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:53.300]  must have thought about this stuff so
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.100]  think so but for example just think like
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.600]  if you're doing a keynote if you're in a
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.600]  keynote and you're taking you're taking
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.100]  notes and you're tweeting and let's say
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:04.900]  you know you're part of like a bigger
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.400]  news organization where there's like a
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.400]  team and you've got like an internal
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.100]  slack when you want to see all three of
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.700]  those things on the screen at once yeah
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:16.100]  you would write it you know I I you know
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.700]  apples thought about it the question is
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:19.700]  have they taken the time and put a team
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.900]  together to actually make make something
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:24.200]  truly thoroughly thoughtful and it ready
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.400]  to go I would love to see it this year
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.700]  at WWDC and I think you know it just
[01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:31.100]  seems like something that could be could
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.000]  be on the table and I think it would get
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.200]  a great response yeah yeah so do I all
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.500]  right so iPad I think I've had will be a
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.300]  big software and hardware big part of
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:47.000]  WWDC rumors that they're working on a
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000]  Siri speak standalone series speaker
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.800]  device you know one of those we do I we
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.300]  have the Amazon echo okay and we use it
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.900]  we play music and we don't really do
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.900]  much else but we're we're we're but but
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:11.100]  we're looking at getting like some you
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.500]  know smart home stuff we don't have any
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.500]  smart home stuff our house is very dumb
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.300]  yeah and getting like some lights that
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.700]  are set up so that you can just turn all
[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.300]  the lights on and off at a time get
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:25.400]  window shades that you can raise and
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.300]  lower you know and stuff like that and
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.300]  if unless Apple comes out with something
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.600]  like that we will we will hook them up
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.000]  to our Amazon thing because the Amazon
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.500]  thing works pretty well for controlling
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.800]  those things supposedly I can't verify
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.000]  it because I don't have anything like
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.200]  that in the house yet but but we will
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.000]  and there's I it's not just people
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.700]  wishing for it there are rumors that
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.400]  Apple is working on something like that
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:56.500]  right right but isn't Siri gonna have to
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:01.200]  get a lot smarter I think all of these
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.400]  things need to get a lot smarter I think
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.300]  they're all dumb in different ways and
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.900]  right people this is my central premise
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:10.300]  I'm not I don't defend serious being
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.200]  light years ahead of any of these
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.300]  competitors I do think Siri is ahead of
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.600]  Google's and Amazon's in certain ways
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.500]  and I think Google's is ahead I think
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:22.100]  all three of them have their pluses and
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:24.100]  minuses and depending on what you want
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.100]  out of it one of them might make you
[01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.900]  happy and then you think the other ones
[01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:29.500]  are garbage because they don't do the
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.400]  things you know I totally get it I can
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.500]  see that Amazon's thing does things that
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.100]  Siri can't and works in certain ways
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.900]  that Siri doesn't and if that's all you
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:41.500]  want to do it you know it makes you very
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.200]  happy as an echo user but that doesn't
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.900]  mean that Siri is garbage you know but
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:48.800]  at Siri would obviously have to be much
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.600]  improved for a standalone family device
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.900]  than it is right now yeah I mean I know
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.300]  there's so many things all these things
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.200]  have to improve for a family device it
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.800]  has to be able to recognize voices and I
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.600]  know I know how tricky that can be like
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.100]  for example I apparently I don't hear it
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.300]  but when I became a teenager when I hit
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:13.000]  puberty when I answered the phone and
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.200]  the phone call was for my dad every
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.700]  single time they just start talking to
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.500]  me like I was Bob Gruber it was so weird
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.700]  like because as a kid you know like my
[01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:23.800]  dad had like a long commute to work
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.700]  every day and so a lot of times and and
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.300]  so he'd carpool with some of his
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.200]  colleagues and so a lot of times before
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.700]  and my dad worked third shift so like he
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.900]  would leave he would leave for work
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.900]  around like nine o'clock at night so a
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.500]  lot of times you know like between like
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.600]  you know like seven and eight or
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.700]  something like that my dad might be
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:44.700]  taking a nap after dinner before he gets
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:46.300]  ready for work and the phone rings and
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:47.800]  it's somebody you know one of his the
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.000]  guys regular guys who he rides to work
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.800]  with with you know maybe it's gonna be
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.800]  10 minutes late or something and if I
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.300]  answered the phone they'd say Bob hey
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.300]  and then they start talking to me right
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.500]  and so if a human being thought that me
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.100]  as a teenager sounded like my dad it's
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:06.200]  going to be a tough programming problem
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.400]  to get a standalone device that can tell
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:12.700]  to two siblings a brother two brothers
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.100]  who are two years apart who kind of
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.400]  sound the same because genetically
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:19.300]  they're brothers yeah or a father and a
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.300]  son or something like that I understand
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.800]  that's a probably a hard prop problem
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:25.600]  but guess what in real life you can tell
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.100]  people's voices apart right and and
[01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.900]  that's you know these devices have to be
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.800]  as smart as people in that in that
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.900]  device in that regard I I agree with you
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.900]  I I think a lot of the the problem and
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:45.300]  as you mentioned is what you want to be
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.300]  able to do and at this point I try and
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:51.400]  have everything so dumbed down because
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.200]  I've run into so many problems with
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.900]  these assistants I I try and ask the
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.400]  simplest of questions and otherwise I'll
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.500]  just go Google you know yeah because
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.500]  it's even even just I think it was last
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.800]  weekend or the weekend before I asked
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.900]  Siri what time the hockey game was on
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.100]  the NHL playoffs and Siri came up and
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.700]  gave me a game that was coming up on
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.800]  Monday and I said I I guess there is no
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.000]  game on today I thought there was so I
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.400]  turned on the the TV there's a hockey
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:27.500]  game on you know it's coming up the end
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.700]  and then that instantly burns your trust
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.900]  right now you feel like doing right
[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.000]  instantly and and I'm thinking at that
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.100]  point and I tried it again you know what
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.900]  time is the hockey game on today and
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.100]  Siri gave me the the hockey game on
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.100]  Monday again and you know I'm thinking
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:46.700]  well is there somebody at Apple sitting
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:50.400]  there typing stuff into Syria but they
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.400]  don't work on the weekends this weird
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.800]  it's it's weird when you get the right
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.600]  answer so many times in a row I got a
[01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.600]  bunch of them during the NCAA tournament
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.300]  where I was really you know my favorite
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.900]  team is North Carolina and they they
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:05.200]  ended up winning the championship so
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.300]  there but there were a lot of games to
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.400]  watch them because they kept winning and
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.800]  I was asking you know when's next North
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.800]  Carolina game and I get I got the right
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.500]  answer most times but then one time I
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.700]  got the wrong answer and I think it was
[01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.800]  the same thing you might have run into
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.800]  where the game had already started you
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.200]  know and it a human assistant if I had
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.300]  a human Butler in my house who could
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.100]  answer my questions because I'm Bruce
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.700]  Wayne or whatever you know and I could
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:33.800]  have Alfred Alfred if Alfred knew the
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.600]  game was on right now he would say oh
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.300]  you're missing it and you know North
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.600]  it's there's two minutes it the first
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.900]  quarter first half started three minutes
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.100]  ago in North Carolina is up 64 yeah and
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:48.100]  it's on shit and it's on channel 803 if
[01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.800]  you ask about basketball that's what it
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.200]  will say what I'll say oh a Golden
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.600]  State's winning six to four it's you
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.200]  know two minutes into the fourth first
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.400]  quarter or something right so I just I
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.900]  don't that's what burns me about these
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.000]  assistants they're so early days they're
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.400]  so primitive it's it's literally like
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.500]  the like the Apple one you know where
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.300]  you you know you programmed it you had
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.500]  to like turned it on and all you could
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.500]  do is like write your own programs it
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.200]  that's where all of these devices are
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:24.200]  Google's Amazon's it's Siri on your
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.500]  devices but they gotta be so much more
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.300]  if I've got a thing in my kitchen it it
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.800]  should be trivial it's got to work where
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.500]  if I say what's on my calendar today I
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.900]  get my calendar and if my wife says
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.600]  what's on my calendar day she gets her
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.400]  calendar right and you it doesn't work
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.800]  like that there's a way to hook up like
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.900]  a second thing to Amazon but you have to
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.400]  like it doesn't just work by both of us
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.200]  saying that you have to say like like
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.400]  you have to tell like hey dingus switch
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.300]  the account from John to Amy and then
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.600]  it's using a different account or
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.000]  something like that it doesn't just work
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.300]  in the way that it should which is you
[01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.800]  just talk to it and it knows who's
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.500]  talking to you right I mean in the other
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:03.400]  thing that would make these things
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.600]  smarter and help identify voices would
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:07.200]  be if they combined it with a camera and
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.700]  not have separate devices like Amazon's
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.100]  coming out with where there's a separate
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:12.500]  one with a camera and there's the thing
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.300]  with a speaker and stuff like that but
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.300]  if it has a camera it would help like if
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.200]  the software has trouble telling the
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.900]  voices of me and my dad apart it the
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.100]  camera should help clarify it because I
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.400]  don't look anything like my dad and
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.900]  wasn't there a story a little while ago
[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:33.700]  that Schiller said that these types of
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:37.700]  devices needed a screen I think he did
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:43.100]  yes so you know the next one more an
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.900]  Apple one would have a screen yeah
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.900]  Amazon I came out with the one with the
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.900]  screen you did the other week and I
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:51.700]  showed it to and we have the Amazon echo
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:55.000]  in our kitchen and it it's subtle enough
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  and tuck away able enough in a corner
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.900]  that it flew but I showed that to Amy I
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:01.200]  was like would you would you let me put
[01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.600]  one of these in the kitchen and she said
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.200]  no well maybe she was just testing you
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.700]  you should go get it put it in there and
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.700]  see how she reacts in I don't know it's
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.700]  not an attractive device I wouldn't call
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:17.500]  it ugly per se but it looks like a sort
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:22.300]  of 80s Buck Rogers sort of aesthetic it
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:25.600]  does not look like a very elegant device
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.400]  like if Apple came out with the device
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.800]  that looked like that I would I would
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  honestly people would leave the keynote
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.700]  and be like you know sell the stock
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.300]  short the stock you know something's
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:39.000]  gone wrong I mean it I I really do mean
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.200]  it and I kind of feel like people grade
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.700]  Amazon on a curve yes they do they're
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.000]  not known for their design but the truth
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.900]  is they're competing in the same you
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.700]  know they're competing against Apple so
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.000]  why shouldn't they be judged by this
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.900]  when Apple has raised the bar for how
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.900]  devices look why in the world should a
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:58.000]  company making competing devices not be
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  graded on the same scale well I agree
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.600]  with you but why shouldn't Amazon be
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.900]  graded on on not making any money either
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.300]  you know well that's a separate
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.300]  discussion I mean yeah it's you know
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:12.100]  they I'm amenable to the agreement that
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:13.500]  they could make money if they wanted to
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.600]  and since investors aren't asking them
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.100]  to why not just not make any money well
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.700]  it's a lie I think that's a separate
[01:36:20.700 --> 01:36:24.300]  issue it is it is a separate issue so I
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.400]  think Apple is going to have one at WDC
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.600]  well that that's what I was just I was
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.700]  gonna ask you that I don't know I I
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:35.400]  don't think so I don't think so here's
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.700]  what I think I it I think it's so
[01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.300]  exciting because it the only thing people
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:41.800]  seem to know is Apple might have
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:44.300]  something in this category I think if
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:47.700]  Apple does it is very very likely that
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:52.500]  it is conceptually different than the
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.500]  echo and the Google one the echo and the
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.600]  Google one to me are the exact same
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600]  concept they do look different Google's
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.700]  is more like a vase but there are
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.300]  speakers that listen and do things and
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:05.000]  can be hooked up and I think if Apple
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.400]  comes out with one it's going to be
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.400]  different conceptually like maybe it's
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.900]  less about it being a thing that you
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:13.000]  talk to and it really is just a speaker
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.400]  system so that you can play airplay
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.500]  music to it well then that's kind of
[01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.400]  boring it is kind of boring but it might
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.600]  be it might be more what it might
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.500]  fulfill a different need and if it is a
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:29.300]  sort of intelligent assistant type thing
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.200]  it might be might be very different I
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.300]  would like something different
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:39.500]  conceptually but I I don't know what
[01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.100]  that is you know I I just want it to
[01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.300]  work you know I've said before I've
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.000]  tried to add reminders and appointments
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.700]  and things like that in with Siri and
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:56.200]  it's it just you know it could work but
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.100]  then again maybe not and you know I
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:05.000]  think that we've all collectively sort
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.400]  of given up on Apple's Wi-Fi hardware
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.700]  yeah I mean a part of it is because
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:12.700]  it's been a long time since they've
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.600]  updated it part of it is that there are
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.300]  a lot of competing products that have
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:19.900]  come out with with newer you know newer
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.800]  stuff you know like the mesh networks
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.200]  that eros do and stuff like that it but
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.800]  going back to three years there's been
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.800]  speculation ever since Apple has started
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:37.100]  the the home kit stuff that paid wouldn't
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:39.300]  doesn't this home kit stuff sort of seem
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:44.200]  like it needs a hub you know like in the
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.100]  you know and Apple has often used that
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:49.300]  hub metaphor that you know the digit you
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.900]  know that the Mac is your digital hub
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.400]  back in 2001 and it's it's the thing
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.100]  that you plug your digital camera into
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.300]  you plug your iPod into and it's your
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.100]  digital hub and and if you have a video
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.500]  camera that shoots digital video what do
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.600]  you do with it you plug it into your
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.900]  Mac okay then famously I think it might
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.600]  have been his last keynote Steve Jobs
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:12.300]  announcing iCloud said this is the new
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:15.000]  hub of your personal life the hub is
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  going to be iCloud and the truth is in
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.900]  the cloud and so you know your documents
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.300]  are in iCloud and then they show up as
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.700]  satellites to your Mac is now just a
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:27.600]  satellite device like your phone and
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.700]  your iPad or your Apple TV for the home
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.300]  kit though III think that there is a
[01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.800]  need for a hub and and it makes sense
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.600]  that it wouldn't be in the cloud that it
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.000]  would could be a device that's in your
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.200]  home because your home is is a thing
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.300]  that doesn't go places right so what is
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:51.700]  it going to control I don't know
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.300]  everything everything that's smart in
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.200]  your house right and it you know but
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.600]  that it's you know and this idea isn't
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.100]  new but we've people don't talk about it
[01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:05.400]  anymore but what if it also was your
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:09.200]  Wi-Fi base station you know and that you
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.700]  know Mark Erman's report that they're
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.500]  out of the business of making stuff is
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.600]  just you know it wrong you know and that
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.500]  they've been hard at work on a new hub
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:22.900]  like thing that instead of just
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.600]  distributing Wi-Fi to your house is is
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.500]  there for all sorts of other things as
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:30.700]  well speaker it could play music it can
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:33.000]  control your your smart lights and your
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.300]  shit window shades and and stuff like
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:39.000]  that all by talking to it right or
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.800]  connecting to iCloud would let you give
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.200]  you a secure way to do it remotely from
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.400]  your phone I mean and there are ways you
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.400]  know I know that there's back to your
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.000]  Mac and there's other ways that when
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.200]  you're out and you know like if you've
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.000]  got the nest thermostats you can use the
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.100]  nest app to adjust the temperature in
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.200]  your house when you're outside the house
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.000]  using the app I'm not saying that there
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.800]  aren't already ways that these smart
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.500]  house devices can be controlled
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:06.900]  externally but something that you know
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.400]  I don't know enough about it you know
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.300]  what I mean and the details but it you
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:11.500]  know that Apple is interested in the
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.100]  home because they have home kid and they
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.100]  talk about it and they are working on it
[01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.700]  but it seems to me like a centralized
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.100]  device that or you know maybe not
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:21.600]  centralized maybe it's something that
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.000]  you would buy two or three of the same
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.300]  thing and put them in different rooms
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:26.200]  but something that could tie into that
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.600]  seems to have potential and maybe you
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.000]  know if you have two or three of them
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.800]  maybe they do work like eros and
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.600]  distribute a mesh network of Wi-Fi like
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.000]  Wi-Fi is not a solved problem good Wi-Fi
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.400]  in the house it's not a whole problem
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.800]  and it is better than it used to be but
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.400]  it still could be a lot better so you
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.300]  know I wouldn't be surprised there's a
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:49.300]  need that like that's the thing is it
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.800]  seems like something Apple could do it
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:52.800]  is something along the lines of what
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.300]  they've done in the past and they're
[01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:57.400]  overdue for a product in this space so I
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:02.000]  have faith and maybe it's it's
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.300]  misplaced but I don't think so I have
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:05.800]  faith that if Apple is going to do
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.100]  something in this space it's going to
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.600]  do it in a way that is different and
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.300]  that's what I was saying earlier I'm
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:15.000]  ready for conceptually a change but I
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.900]  don't know what that is but Apple does
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.400]  right you know this is something that I
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.800]  want them to not just do the same thing
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:26.400]  that Google is or that Amazon is but all
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.000]  of a sudden Apple unveils this this
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  system and you can do all of these
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  different things with it just by talking
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.700]  to it and it works every time you ask it
[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.200]  to do something you know that's that's I
[01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.800]  would love that I I'd be right out there
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:48.300]  getting one of those yeah I me too so I
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:50.500]  follow that under maybe and I just think
[01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.800]  I do think too I think based on their
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.600]  hiring I think based on what we know
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.900]  that they've they've opened up their
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:01.000]  policies in regards to AI researchers
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.100]  who work at Apple being allowed to share
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.700]  and publish their stuff in in
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:10.500]  professional journals which was
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.400]  apparently a real recruiting problem for
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.400]  Apple that that the these you know the
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:19.100]  top men and women in the artificial
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.700]  intelligence research for their careers
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:24.500]  they need to publish on a regular basis
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:27.500]  in these publications and that it career
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.600]  wise going to Apple if you're not
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.200]  allowed to publish your stuff in some
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.000]  ways you can't you know obviously
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.500]  there's some kind of dollar amount that
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:37.900]  you could offer somebody that they're
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:39.400]  going to say okay I'll do it even if I
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.100]  hate that I can't publish my results but
[01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.800]  it you know just by competing at a
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.400]  salary for salary level with other
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.400]  companies like Google and Amazon and all
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.900]  of these companies to Facebook that are
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:53.600]  doing putting significant money in AI
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.000]  research if you're competing dollar for
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.400]  dollar with these other companies and
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.000]  the other companies let you publish your
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.400]  research and Apple doesn't it was
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.800]  keeping keeping the talent from going to
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:06.100]  Apple and so we know you know that Apple
[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:07.600]  researchers have started publishing and
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.600]  that they've opened up their policies
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.900]  something's got to come out of that like
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.300]  Apple hasn't really had much along the
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.900]  lines of AI that's a big leap forward
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:27.000]  since Siri came out but no but it's
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.600]  going to be more than just Siri yeah I
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:34.700]  totally agree I but I think in you said
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:36.400]  it just works you just want something
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.700]  that just works that's right I mean
[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:39.800]  that's what drew all of us who are fans
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:41.800]  of Apple or follow Apple closely it the
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:45.600]  it just works factor is it's the top of
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.200]  the list whatever your interests are
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.100]  whether you're a graphic designer or
[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:53.700]  writer or you know it even like if it
[01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:56.400]  you know whatever whatever you do on
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.300]  your Apple stuff you know the it just
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:01.100]  works factor is huge it's the definition
[01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:03.000]  of Apple and it's just not there on the
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.800]  AI front right but you know I'm you said
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.700]  earlier that that's this whole thing
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.900]  this whole industry is new you know so
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:17.900]  nobody has it right yet but I will say
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:20.300]  Amazon made some very smart moves at CES
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:25.700]  you know by by making Alexa basically
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:29.000]  available as you know the the AI yeah
[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.100]  sort of like the Android of phones yeah
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:33.000]  yeah that was brilliant it was a
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  brilliant move they gave it to like
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.100]  fridge companies and yep all kinds of
[01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.200]  people yeah there's move on there not in
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.700]  it to sell the hardware really they're
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.300]  in it to keep people in the Amazon
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.000]  ecosystem yes you know subscribing to
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.500]  Prime and hey we're out of paper towels
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.000]  just tell your Amazon dingus to send
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.700]  some paper towels yeah and and let's
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.800]  make no mistake Amazon does have a great
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.400]  brand you know people know that they can
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.100]  go to Amazon and buy stuff and it's
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.800]  gonna be delivered and it's you know
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.700]  it's gonna work except for that whole
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:08.700]  thing where they allow all the knock
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:13.500]  off so you know yeah kind of upsets me
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.300]  but otherwise I I think that you know
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:16.600]  they have they have a great brand they
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  do a good thing all right let me take
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.500]  a final break here and thank our third
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.900]  and final sponsor of the show check it
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.800]  friends at mail route I love this
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:27.000]  company you know who should handle your
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.700]  email security and delivery people who
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.700]  only do that people who specialize in
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:35.200]  the email that's mail route even big
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:37.000]  companies are bowing out of the email
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.200]  protection business meaning your emails
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.000]  coming in how do you filter out the spam
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.600]  and the junk and the stuff with scammy
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.300]  links and attachments and stuff like
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.100]  that Postini went away now McAfee and MX
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.500]  logic have gotten out of the business
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:56.000]  even Google came out and said that they
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.700]  want you to use a gateway service like
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.400]  mail route so that they don't have to be
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.500]  the front line filtering your Google
[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.600]  Apps mail you can trust mail route
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.400]  they've been around that staff the team
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.300]  it their team has been together and
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.300]  focused on email security and only on
[01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.500]  email security since 1997 if you think
[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:16.300]  about it email is crazy like every other
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:18.400]  service on the internet like Twitter I
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.100]  get it there's spam and there's there's
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.500]  there's abuse on Twitter and stuff like
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.300]  that but at least everybody on Twitter
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.200]  has a Twitter account and Twitter is a
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.100]  centralized service that if there's an
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.900]  account that's making trouble they can
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:32.800]  just close the account like email it's
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.900]  just you have an email address anybody
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:37.400]  else who has a an email server can send
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.200]  email to that address and the email
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.000]  server accepts it like it it's a crazy
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.100]  protocol that is based on the trust of
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.500]  the early days of the internet where
[01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:49.100]  there is no identity system it's crazy
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.000]  how much junk comes to every email
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.600]  address you have mail route makes all of
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.700]  that go away and it's all they do what
[01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.600]  you do is you keep your existing mail
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.400]  server could be Google Apps could be a
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:04.000]  fast mail could be a dream host could
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.100]  be your company's email on an exchange
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.100]  server what you do is you change your
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.500]  MX records for your your company or your
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.900]  personal domain name just go to mail
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:14.900]  route first and mail route doesn't host
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:17.300]  your email all they do is filter the
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:19.600]  spam and viruses and junk so your mail
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.500]  your MX record sends it to mail route
[01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.500]  first it's just a thin filter
[01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:26.600]  conceptually and then mail route sends
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.400]  it on to your existing mail server so
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:29.800]  you keep your mail server you don't even
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:31.400]  change your clients your email client
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:33.500]  on your phone and your your your device
[01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.700]  doesn't know anything's changed it's
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:38.400]  just the outside world the mail goes to
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.400]  mail route first then to your server
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:43.100]  that's it and they have all the features
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:44.500]  you would want you can sign up if you
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.000]  want and get a weekly report on on like
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.400]  here's the iffy emails that we were like
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.700]  maybe on we thought maybe this was junk
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.900]  you want to double check you want to
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.800]  eyeball this list of emails to make sure
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.000]  that nothing got flagged that shouldn't
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  get flagged it's got a programmatic API
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  so if you it's like in a professional
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.200]  context if you work in IT and you need
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.000]  to customize this in certain ways you
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:07.500]  can write your own scripts and programs
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.300]  that talk to mail route anything you
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.700]  want to do I mean this is a whole
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.900]  company that does this one thing and
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.900]  that's it mail route really it's a
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.600]  fantastic service I can't recommend it

[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.400]  didn't talk Mac well there's rumors of
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.600]  max there's rumors of updated Mac
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.300]  laptops already you know which would be
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.500]  pretty for MacBook Pro would be pretty
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:14.200]  fast for a nine-month update so I don't
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.000]  not sure I buy that but on the other
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.700]  hand if they really do have new Intel
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.400]  chipsets that are ready to go maybe you
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.800]  know maybe it's just going to be one of
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.000]  these quick ones where right oh yeah by
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.900]  the way today we're doing this or just a
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.200]  press release hmm I well I on the
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:34.800]  keynote I'm sure they'd mention it but I
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.900]  think I don't think it would be a big
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:37.600]  part of the presentation because even if
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.200]  they have updated MacBook Pros I don't
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.000]  really think there'd be anything to show
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.800]  off about them it's just oh they're
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.200]  faster and maybe maybe I don't know if
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.300]  about the Intel stuff that it maybe
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:49.800]  there's a way to configure them with 32
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.800]  gigabytes of RAM I don't know I think
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:54.400]  more likely would be an update to the
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.300]  just plain MacBook because that one is
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:58.200]  now over a year old and has not been
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:02.600]  updated I love that computer really do I
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:06.900]  and it needs an update because it's the
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.700]  one and only thing that I think is wrong
[01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:10.200]  with the device is that it is kind of
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.800]  slow and so it's it's by using those
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.100]  Intel mobile M chipsets it lets it run
[01:51:16.100 --> 01:51:18.300]  without a fan it lets it be super super
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:23.800]  thin but dollar for our benchmark for
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.300]  benchmark it's actually slower than an
[01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:28.600]  iPad Pro so it could use you know that's
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:30.300]  a device that really could use the
[01:51:30.300 --> 01:51:31.600]  latest and greatest from Intel
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.700]  performance wise okay I don't I don't
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:38.400]  disagree with with that at all but I
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:42.100]  would say that anybody that uses one of
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.800]  the MacBooks isn't really in it for
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.400]  speed then it for you know right it's
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.800]  not so slow that I would have said a
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.600]  year ago don't buy it I write I but but
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.500]  I would say now in 2017 yeah I think it
[01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.100]  to do for an upgrade and I think it's
[01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:58.600]  the type of device that should be on it
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:01.200]  once a year update schedule yeah yeah I
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:03.100]  don't disagree with for the foreseeable
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.800]  future you know there's no point down
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.800]  the road to five six years from now
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:09.500]  where the these the chipsets like the
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:12.400]  Intel mm series will be fast enough that
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.700]  you you wouldn't need a you once a year
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:17.400]  update for these devices yeah but you
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:21.300]  know if I pull out my my MacBook I'm not
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.000]  going to be recording music on it I'm
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.200]  going to be doing email and web
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.300]  browsing and stuff like that you know so
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.500]  I would not be surprised to see a new
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.200]  updated MacBook just because it's been
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:33.000]  over a year the rumor that there's
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.300]  already new MacBook pros I don't I find
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:38.600]  that hard to believe yeah I mean it's
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:40.000]  possible I wouldn't be shocked but I
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.500]  would be a little surprised but then but
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.300]  then when would be the next time that
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:47.600]  they would release a MacBook Pro they
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:50.300]  wouldn't be at the iPhone event no I
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.400]  think it would be like last year it'd be
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.500]  in October but I don't think that they
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.800]  would do an event for this no probably
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.200]  not if I can't see it because it's but
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.700]  you know like the event was because the
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:05.200]  touch bar was all new and you know it if
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:07.400]  it's just faster and just has more RAM
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:10.900]  that's that's not an event right all
[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:14.400]  right wild card what if they totally
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:18.300]  sandbagged us in March with that future
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:21.500]  of the Mac roundtable and they have new
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:24.300]  Mac pros ready to announce believe it or
[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.000]  not hmm boy I don't think so I don't
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.400]  think so either I don't think I my sense
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.100]  having actually been in that discussion
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:34.700]  was that there was no way they were
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.500]  sandbagging I wouldn't be surprised if
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.000]  they surprised us and come out with them
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  at the end of the year like October
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:41.700]  right and they would have an event for
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:44.300]  that that would not surprise me if if
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:47.600]  they sort of laid into the you know we
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.300]  didn't say later this year you know
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:51.400]  implying that it would take a full year
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.400]  from when they they made the announcement
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.400]  I wouldn't be surprised if they under
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:57.800]  under promise and over deliver on that
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.200]  but to me I think June is too soon I do
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.100]  think I do too I think that they hit the
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:05.400]  reset button on this too too recently to
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.000]  be ready now I of what I took out of
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.400]  that that meeting was that they were
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]  being very genuine in what they were
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.600]  saying yes so I I don't think that they
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.600]  in any way we're trying to be tricky I
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.200]  don't know so either so I that's why I
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.000]  would say no to two Mac pros yeah and
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.800]  the other thing too is if they thought
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:31.200]  that they could possibly announce them
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.700]  at WWDC then I don't think they would
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.400]  have held that meeting at all they would
[01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.500]  have just waited you know agreed take
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.200]  the hour take the arrows for another
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.800]  three months of the complaints about how
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:42.500]  old the Mac Pro is and their silence on
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.400]  the Mac Pro and then make the announcement
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.700]  at June I think that's the biggest
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:47.100]  evidence that they're not going to say
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:51.000]  anything about it at June yeah but like
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.200]  you said October November yeah that's
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.900]  wide open yeah what about new iMacs the
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.600]  iMac is now a little bit did 5k iMac is
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.000]  a little bit old it's over a year old
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000]  oh year and a half old well honestly I
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.400]  think that depends a lot on the MacBook
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.800]  Pro because I think that they could have
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.300]  an event if they did something
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:19.500]  significant with the iMac and a Mac Pro
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:23.700]  and a MacBook Pro in the fall in the
[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:27.000]  fall yeah so I I think it nobody's
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.500]  really complaining about the iMac it's
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.600]  one of those I mean it yes it's you know
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.300]  there's Intel chips that have come out
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.900]  since that would make it faster but it
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.300]  you know it you know I've got the first
[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:42.000]  5k iMac and which is you know in even a
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.500]  year or older and it's you know for what
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.700]  I do and you know I mean I push my
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.900]  computer a little harder than most
[01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:52.300]  people it's it's you know still the it
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:55.500]  seems brilliantly fast to me so I don't
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.100]  know I'm using you think there's any
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:56:00.900]  chance that have IMAX at WWDC I don't
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.500]  think so I I would I I don't think I
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:08.500]  think that the most reasonable Mac that
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.600]  they could have is probably the MacBook
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.500]  yeah and then depending on when they
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:19.900]  plan on releasing the new Mac Pro they
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.900]  could do a nice event with Mac Pro
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:25.300]  MacBook Pro and iMac in the fall yeah I
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.500]  agree that's what I would guess all
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:31.100]  right what about Mac OS I guess it'll
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:35.900]  be 10.13 hmm I I have no but there's no
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:38.000]  rumors I have you know I expect that
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.500]  they will announce it I expect there is
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:41.900]  such a thing what is in it I have no
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:45.900]  idea no I think no half of me sort of
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.300]  hopes that they have something cool to
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:54.000]  announce for the Mac new just as further
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.900]  evidence of the their their narrative
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:58.800]  which is we still care as deeply about
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:01.000]  the Mac as ever which is contrary to a
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.800]  lot of people you know fears but the
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:05.500]  other half of me kind of hopes that Mac
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:08.200]  OS 10.13 is a really boring release
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.400]  marketing wise and that it's really just
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:17.000]  focused on reliability and cleaning up
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.800]  you know the stuff that's already there
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:22.600]  to make it go from 99% reliable to a
[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:25.600]  hundred percent reliable well I remember
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.200]  years ago when they did remember when
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.400]  they started doing the change stop
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:34.200]  changing the cat and doing it in between
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.600]  like that hip panther or leopard and
[01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:38.800]  snow leopard and and the snow leopard
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:43.100]  one was always a cleanup and lion and
[01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:47.000]  lion and mountain lion yeah I the those
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000]  releases were always so good because
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.700]  they would clean everything up and it
[01:57:52.700 --> 01:57:55.000]  would go so fast you know you would love
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.200]  reliability for me for for Mac OS isn't
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.200]  even a question it's very reliable for
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:05.800]  me I should say that too I mean I told
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.600]  you right before we started I reached
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.200]  right before we started recording I
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:13.200]  reset restarted my MacBook and it's I
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.700]  typed uptime into terminal before I did
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:20.500]  and it was up for like 48 days yeah so
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:22.100]  I'm not saying that my Mac's are not
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:24.400]  reliable I mean that's you know 48 days
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.700]  without rebooting my MacBook Pro which
[01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:29.700]  I've been living on lately you know it's
[01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:31.000]  pretty reliable I'm just saying note
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.900]  that there still are there's a lot of
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:35.300]  little things that you know I agree
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:37.400]  well I remember with snow leopard I
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:38.800]  think it was snow leopard was the one
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.900]  where I think I know the number it was
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.200]  10 6 where they went from 10 5 to 10 6
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:46.700]  and the the OS actually got smaller like
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:49.300]  they cleaned up so much and tighten so
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:51.400]  much that when you upgraded your to the
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.300]  new OS you actually had more free hard
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.100]  drive space available like that's the
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:57.500]  sort of update I would like to see them
[01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.500]  do with the Mac and just you know make
[01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:01.400]  these the info and and the new stuff
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.400]  would just be like any other new
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.000]  integrations like where something is on
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.900]  your iPhone and you can have the same
[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:09.400]  thing on your Mac you know those
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.700]  continuity type features you know I'm
[01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.100]  sure there will be new features but I
[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:14.600]  just think that instead of making it
[01:59:14.600 --> 01:59:16.900]  like a wow this is an amazingly new Mac
[01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:19.000]  experience I think it should be make you
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.300]  feel like you're right at home like you
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:23.200]  are in Sierra today it's just better one
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.600]  about things like iTunes do you think
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:28.800]  they're ready to unveil a new oh boy
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.000]  that would be a surprise wouldn't it
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.600]  wouldn't it I would love it I think it's
[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.300]  overdue I mean I would really like to
[01:59:36.300 --> 01:59:39.900]  see them bust iTunes out into a bunch of
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:42.700]  separate apps yeah yeah I would like to
[01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:44.800]  see iTunes be all about the app named
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:48.100]  iTunes would be all about music I'd like
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:49.700]  they should I think they should even
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:51.900]  have a separate podcast app for the Mac
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:55.000]  I think Apple TV should be its own app
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.200]  on on on the Mac where that's where you
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.800]  go if you want to watch TV in movies you
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:02.800]  know in the same way that they
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.100]  thankfully didn't put iBooks into
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:08.300]  iTunes right yeah I laugh because it
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:09.600]  seems silly but that's what they've done
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.200]  with everything else right everything
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:13.300]  yeah it makes no more sense to read a
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:14.700]  book in iTunes than it does to watch a
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:16.100]  movie in iTunes but that's what you do
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.600]  if you're watching a movie on your Mac I
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.700]  would love to see them clean that up I
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.000]  don't know if they're ever going to I
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.500]  I've always thought the thing that's
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.300]  holding them back the most is the fact
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:26.600]  that they need to have a Windows version
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:30.300]  of iTunes for people to sync literally
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:32.100]  still I mean they still sell iPods you
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:37.100]  know yeah but I I mean they don't
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:38.900]  necessarily need a Windows version to
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:41.900]  start off I say let Windows keep their
[02:00:41.900 --> 02:00:47.000]  monolithic piece of crap iTunes and you
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.500]  know make it make it nice on the Mac
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:51.400]  yeah and separate them you know I I
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.800]  think what's holding them back is the
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.500]  fact that iTunes is the the gateway to
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:01:00.000]  all the money
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  I don't know if it is anymore though
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.200]  really I mean and why couldn't you just
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.000]  buy if why wouldn't you just be able to
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.500]  buy your iTunes movies in the new TV app
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:12.500]  for Apple I mean for Mac I don't think
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.400]  it would decrease the money at all and
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  you know I just mean that like I think
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.900]  that that whole system is so old you
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:24.000]  know everything to do with it is old
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.500]  yeah but on it it's probably still
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.500]  running on web objects for God's sake it
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:30.200]  is well the URLs certainly look like
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.200]  they are but but on it hasn't stopped
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.700]  iOS from having a nice array of distinct
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.700]  discrete apps that do smaller amounts of
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:44.100]  you know very specific things right it
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.700]  hasn't stopped them from doing it well
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:49.200]  on iOS I I would love to see that I
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.100]  think the chances are very low but I
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:53.000]  would love to see it yeah I think it's
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.700]  possible but what else might they
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.700]  announce Apple TV anything Apple TV
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.500]  related to WWDC maybe some some software
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.300]  but I don't expect anything huge yeah
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:09.400]  and it really don't it huge to me would
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:12.000]  be if they if they untie the knot that
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.200]  is their their answer to these TV
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:20.000]  bundles you know and I don't think that
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.600]  that's going to happen at WWDC because
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.300]  that's the one thing that leaks these
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:26.500]  media companies leak like sieves you
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:28.300]  know like Eddie Eddie Q goes in and
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:30.300]  meets with HBO and five minutes later
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:32.000]  there's a story in variety about Eddie
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.800]  Q's meeting with HBO I mean guess what
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.700]  he doesn't even get back to the car and
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:37.300]  it's already leaked right and it already
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:39.300]  says what type of sandals he showed up
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:44.900]  to the meeting and yeah and so the fact
[02:02:44.900 --> 02:02:47.400]  that there don't seem to be any leaks of
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:52.500]  an imminent you know pay $20 a month or
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:02:55.000]  add add an extra $10 a month to your
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.900]  Apple music subscription and you get TV
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:02:59.200]  to like that's where I feel like they're
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.600]  going to go I feel like they're going to
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:03.000]  sort of sort of make the same naming
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.400]  mistake they made before which is that
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.400]  they named the thing iTunes and the
[02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.400]  iTunes music store and then all of a
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:12.800]  sudden they were selling TV shows and
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.300]  movies and apps from the iTunes music
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.800]  store I think the same thing might
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:18.200]  happen with Apple music where Apple
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:19.900]  music is the thing where you pay Apple
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.800]  10 bucks a month or maybe 20 bucks a
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:26.200]  month as an option and you get Apple
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:30.100]  media it's all you know like Netflix and
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:34.200]  Hulu and and those things I wouldn't be
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.800]  surprised if they just call it Apple
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.700]  music but it includes because they're
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:40.800]  already these TV shows that Apple is
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:43.100]  producing the handful of TV shows that
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:46.500]  is the the planet of the apps and the
[02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:49.300]  carpool karaoke that they're going to be
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:51.100]  given the way you watch them is you have
[02:03:51.100 --> 02:03:53.400]  to have an Apple music subscription so I
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.700]  wouldn't be surprised if that's what it
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:56.400]  is but what what I'm talking about is
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.900]  something like PlayStation view vue yes
[02:03:58.900 --> 02:04:01.600]  where you pay you pay Sony $20 a month
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.300]  or something like that or $30 a month
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:06.100]  and you get like 40 cable TV channels
[02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:08.000]  that you can watch whenever you want
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.800]  it's it's a tremendous deal it really is
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:15.500]  and have you done it uh no but I
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:19.300]  seriously thought about it but I the
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:22.000]  main reason we don't is that we have a
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.700]  TiVo a nice TiVo and I love the TiVo
[02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:28.000]  interface and my wife she loves it even
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.600]  more and it's super super comfortable
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:34.300]  and familiar with it and the one thing
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.000]  that is so great about TiVo and I feel
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.400]  like people who don't have it maybe
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:38.600]  don't understand it because they're like
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:40.800]  well I get a DVR from my cable provider
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.300]  or my PlayStation works as a as a DVR
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:47.300]  that the amazing thing about TiVo do
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:48.100]  you have a different minute for an
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:54.300]  aside Jim yeah is I first saw TiVo in
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:57.800]  the year 2000 I think it might have been
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.500]  1999 but it was 2000 at Rich Segal's
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.500]  house this is when I was it was either
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:06.200]  when I was interviewing to go work for
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:08.400]  him at barebone software or right after
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.400]  I took the job and Amy and I moved up
[02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:12.400]  there and and Rich invited us down to
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:16.400]  his house and I even remember what we
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.400]  were watching it was this is around
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:20.400]  2000 so this is when the Yankees were on
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:22.200]  that run with Derek Jeter see it all
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.900]  comes full circle and he invited us down
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:26.200]  even though Rich is a diehard Red Sox
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:30.200]  fan as any New Englander should be he
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.600]  invited my wife and I to his house to
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:34.200]  watch the Yankees and he had a TiVo and
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:37.600]  it blew I'd heard of it I had heard of
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.100]  TiVo and it sounded good oh you can
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.200]  pause lies live TV and you can fast
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.600]  forward commercials and whatever but
[02:05:45.600 --> 02:05:47.800]  seeing it in action was just it was like
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:49.900]  seeing the Mac for the first time and we
[02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:51.200]  would Amy and I went out and bought a
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.800]  TiVo the next day I mean it was it was
[02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.800]  that type of thing but the amazing thing
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.900]  about TiVo and the way the industry is
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:01.800]  gone is what TiVo was is it was a
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:04.000]  computer running Linux that took your
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.700]  TV signals and wrote them to digital
[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.800]  files and on hard disk and then
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:12.200]  presented an interface on screen and so
[02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:15.000]  it was a computerized an analog thing
[02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.700]  you took an analog cable TV signal
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:19.500]  computerized it and you have your
[02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:21.400]  computer there and then with that
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.200]  computer you can fast forward
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.000]  commercials and you can pause the show
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.200]  anywhere you want and it it it's a fast
[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.800]  enough interface like navigating the
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.700]  which show do you want to watch or how
[02:06:32.700 --> 02:06:35.100]  do you set up a subscription on TiVo is
[02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:37.300]  notoriously slow they kind of have a bad
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:40.200]  system user interface yeah but the
[02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:43.600]  actual video playback interface is the
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.300]  best I've ever seen still to this day in
[02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:48.900]  terms of when you fast forward you
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.700]  there's never any buffering at all ever
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.300]  and this goes back to the year 2000 and
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:57.300]  let alone today with the you know newer
[02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:01.800]  TiVo hardware and so computerizing TV
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:05.400]  let you skip commercials and the thing
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:07.600]  that to me is so ironic about
[02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.600]  computerization of TV today and
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.800]  everybody watching through PlayStations
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:14.500]  or Apple TVs or airplay over your phone
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:18.900]  or whatever is that what they've largely
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.800]  done is made it so you can't skip the
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:23.300]  commercials by computerizing it like you
[02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:25.500]  go and you watch a show on HBO go
[02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:28.500]  there's actually I think HBO lets you
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.300]  fast forward them but there are some of
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:32.200]  the ones where they show you that it's
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:34.000]  often a commercial for another show on
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000]  the same service but you can't skip it
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.500]  and when you watch on Hulu and they have
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.200]  regular commercial commercials like
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:41.500]  you're watching a show on Hulu and
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.000]  there's like a bounty paper towels
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.200]  commercial you hit fast forward and it
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.800]  goes bonk bonk bonk and you've you're
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:49.400]  stuck watching that 30-second spot
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.000]  YouTube has unskippable commercials
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.400]  right or or you have tensed you have to
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:57.100]  watch at least 10 seconds of this before
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:08:00.800]  you can skip yeah TiVo let's never ever
[02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:03.700]  ever ever ever ever has an unskippable
[02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.800]  ad it is your fast forward button always
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:11.000]  works in an on-demand I don't know I
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.600]  don't watch on demand on TV okay maybe
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.800]  not but maybe if you can write if they
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:19.400]  write it to disk I don't know yeah they
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.300]  are very good TiVo was always one of
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:23.300]  those companies that I was always
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.100]  surprised that they weren't more
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:27.700]  successful I was too I still am and I
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:29.100]  feel like it's sort of a product
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:30.900]  marketing that they just never really
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:32.500]  had to go to market and Steve Jobs has
[02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:34.300]  explained this that it is it's a hard
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:36.500]  sell when people are already paying
[02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:38.700]  $100 a month to their cable company and
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:41.300]  the cable company with that gives you a
[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:45.400]  quote-unquote free box that puts the TV
[02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.700]  on your TV the shows on your TV it's a
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:50.100]  really hard sell to tell them to spend
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:52.900]  an extra 300 bucks on a better box yep
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:55.800]  but boy we really like TiVo and that's
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:58.100]  really that the if it wasn't for TiVo
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:00.000]  if our TiVo broke and we couldn't buy a
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  new TiVo I would almost we would almost
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.500]  certainly switch to PlayStation Vue
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:08.900]  really I think so hmm and at least in
[02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:10.600]  Philadelphia PlayStation Vue and I know
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:11.700]  that this is one of those weird things
[02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:13.800]  that varies by city it gets all the
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:16.400]  major ABC NBC CBS type things there's I
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:17.800]  know I think I have friends in Boston
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.700]  who it's like they don't get if you have
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:21.600]  PlayStation Vue you don't get ABC or
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:25.000]  something like yes that's right yeah but
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  boy TiVo it keeps us on cable and it's
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.100]  funny because the Comcast here it's like
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.900]  they hate supporting TiVo they kind of
[02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.000]  give you the stink eye when you call
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  them up and you want you got to get
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.300]  these special cable cards but they
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:41.800]  shouldn't because I'll tell you what
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:43.400]  TiVo is the one and only thing keeping
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.400]  us on Comcast cable because it's such a
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:48.200]  great experience and that you never ever
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:49.500]  ever every time I have an unskippable
[02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:51.700]  commercial on any other thing it makes
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:54.300]  me furiously angry because the
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:56.200]  computerization of TV should give me the
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:59.700]  ability to do it right it's yeah but I
[02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:02.000]  won't right the whole reason you
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.800]  couldn't skip commercials before DVRs
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:07.400]  was that you couldn't time travel right
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:09.600]  yeah the TV was on you know the Cosby
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.200]  show came on at eight o'clock and the
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:13.400]  commercial came on at 807 and there was
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.200]  no way to get back to the Cosby show it
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.600]  and other than to wait through the
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:20.500]  commercials yeah I remember those days
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:24.400]  yeah so anyway that's what keeps me on
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:28.300]  what were we talking about WWDC WWDC
[02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:30.100]  anything else that we expect Apple TV
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.900]  is maybe but I it seems like content
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:34.500]  would be that's where we were it was
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.900]  content would be the thing to announce
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.200]  and it doesn't seem like there's any
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.200]  leaks about content no I do expect that
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:46.500]  there'll be some Apple music updates yes
[02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:49.200]  I do too it's too it's too important to
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:51.800]  them not to have updates yes and and
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.800]  they've done from the announcement they
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.700]  did a dub DC which was huge they did
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:02.200]  updates last year to Apple music you
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:07.000]  know a new interface all that and this
[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.300]  year I expect more yeah it seems like
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:10.600]  they're slightly behind schedule on
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.500]  their shows like carpool karaoke and
[02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.300]  planet of the apps were supposed to be
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:16.700]  out in the spring and I know carpool
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:18.500]  karaoke in particular was at one point
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:20.200]  quoted as saying it would come out in
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:23.300]  April and obviously isn't out yet so I
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:24.400]  wouldn't be surprised if we hear updates
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.200]  about them and they surely must be
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:28.400]  coming very soon I will also wouldn't be
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.000]  surprised if they have a handful of
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.500]  other shows to announce because that's
[02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:34.000]  the sort of thing that they can keep
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.900]  secret where they're not talking to HBO
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:39.600]  and they're not talking to Showtime
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:42.700]  they're talking to one team of producers
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:46.400]  and stars and whoever and saying we'll
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.900]  produce your show but you got to keep
[02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:50.100]  your mouth shut or the deals off yeah
[02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:51.600]  you know I wouldn't be surprised if they
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:56.300]  have something like that I agree I that's
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:00.300]  you know if there's one app in in all of
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:02.200]  this that I expect to see majorly
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.500]  updated and and you know that's just
[02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.200]  based on what they've done in the past
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:11.400]  and how important it is to them so that
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:14.500]  I definitely expect to see updated let
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:18.800]  me think what else doesn't seem it seems
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:20.500]  like that's a lot seems like we're at
[02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:21.600]  the end of the show but it still feels
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.800]  like there could be more that they could
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:26.000]  announce well I don't know are there any
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.200]  surprises are there any right there that
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:32.900]  you know I think I think the only real
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:34.600]  surprise that I would be surprised with
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:38.000]  is if they did one of these Siri boxes
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.500]  yeah that would that would be a surprise
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.500]  for me but not a shock not a shock but
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.100]  I'd be surprised if it came at WDC yeah
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:48.600]  right like if they announced that they
[02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:50.400]  are making a self-driving car that would
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.600]  be a shock because they're right right
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.300]  it would be oh my god this is crazy
[02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.800]  because everything we've heard is that
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:58.400]  if they're even if they're still sort of
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.800]  working on that it's like a six seven
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:02.900]  year out thing you know yeah yeah if Tim
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:05.200]  rolls out on a self in a self-driving
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.400]  car out on stage yeah that'll be what
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.400]  about the rumor there's a rumor that
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.600]  iOS 11 has a significant user interface
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:16.400]  refresh I don't think anybody would
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.400]  expect it to be as radical as iOS 7 was
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:22.500]  from iOS 6 right it a little bit but I
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:25.100]  think the rumor is more or less that
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:27.600]  it's more significant than the than the
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.800]  seven to eight eight to nine and nine to
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.400]  ten that would make sense I mean I'm
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.300]  never I would never say no to to a
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:41.300]  software refresh the look and feel of it
[02:13:41.300 --> 02:13:44.400]  because it Apple just does that they I
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.400]  mean look at the OS releases over the
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.200]  years they they've always kind of put a
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:53.500]  little different spin on things and
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:56.300]  three so let's see I was seven then
[02:13:56.300 --> 02:13:59.100]  there one year later was eight nine ten
[02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:01.700]  so this will be four years after iOS 7
[02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:05.200]  first was unveiled and that feels like
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.000]  the right number of years for a more
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.200]  significant you know like not just
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:12.700]  touch-up paint but a new coat of paint
[02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:16.300]  yeah and it's also the sort of thing
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:19.000]  that I think Apple has gotten better
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.900]  than ever in the company's history at
[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:26.000]  keeping secret it's true iOS 7 leaked
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.500]  but only ever so slightly I was just
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:29.700]  talking about this with a friend the
[02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:32.700]  other day and I looked it up Mark
[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:35.400]  German had a couple of descriptions of
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.500]  it and then like a week or two before
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:40.900]  WWDC Seth weintraub of nine-to-five Mac
[02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:43.500]  it wasn't German it was Seth weintraub
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:48.500]  at nine-to-five Mac commissioned he got
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.400]  to see somebody who worked at Apple
[02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:53.700]  showed iOS 7 to him this is like late
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:56.200]  May of that year and then he commissioned
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:02.800]  an artist to recreate what he saw and I
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.100]  should put this I'm going to put this
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:06.700]  initial at nine-to-five Mac leak on
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:12.600]  iOS 7 and those mock-ups were incredibly
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.000]  accurate but it wasn't the whole
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.300]  interface it was just like the home
[02:15:15.300 --> 02:15:17.000]  screen and so we had like the flat
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  flatter look at the icons and stuff like
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.900]  that and so he and his source wouldn't
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:23.600]  let him use a screenshot because he was
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.300]  afraid that they were like watermarked
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:26.700]  and he'd get fired or something like
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:29.800]  that so there was a little bit of iOS
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.000]  7 that leaked but the overall look of it
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.700]  and the you know like the lack of
[02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:36.000]  buttons you know like remember the old
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.700]  back buttons that were buttons and then
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:38.900]  they just change it and it's just a
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:43.200]  chevron that stuff didn't leak no and
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:45.700]  they did a good job well I wouldn't be
[02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.500]  surprised if there is a fairly
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:49.700]  significant refresh with iOS 11 I
[02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:51.500]  wouldn't be surprised if they've kept it
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:53.500]  completely under wraps because I think
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.000]  it's the sort of thing that they could
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.700]  do they would do with a very small team
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:03.300]  and the parts of it that they you know
[02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:05.100]  the hard work of rolling it out to all
[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.900]  of the apps and everything can be done
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:09.800]  in between WWDC and September when it
[02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:13.100]  ships yes like you can't keep it secret
[02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:14.500]  until it ships but you can keep it
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:16.900]  secret until it's announced at WWDC yeah
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:19.400]  is what I'm trying to say anything else
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:26.200]  that you expect to see I think I think
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:30.000]  we hit everything I think how about this
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.800]  how about how about the over-under would
[02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.800]  you bet on whether we see how many how
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:40.100]  many Apple how many speakers on stage
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:42.300]  who we've never seen in a keynote before
[02:16:42.300 --> 02:16:46.300]  I'm going to put that number I'm going
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:50.000]  to put the over-under number two that
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.700]  will see at least two people on stage in
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:56.600]  a speaking role not in other words not
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:59.000]  just like driving the demo silently
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.200]  while somebody else talks two people
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.600]  come out to speak who we've never seen
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.600]  before from Apple or third-party from
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:08.100]  Apple County only counting Apple
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:15.400]  employees Apple employees okay I'm
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.300]  looking over our list here that we made
[02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:25.900]  of devices so we'll probably get an
[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:30.100]  invite okay I'll go under or maybe maybe
[02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:33.100]  I'm putting too much emphasis on never
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:35.700]  before and maybe you know people like
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:41.300]  Susan Prescott and Boz what's her name
[02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:43.200]  Boz the Apple music lady who's yeah
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.100]  yes I just know her as Boz yeah I would
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:49.700]  be if there is Apple music news you know
[02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:51.400]  she's coming out because she's well yeah
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.800]  she's way too awesome yeah she'll be
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:57.700]  there you follow her on Instagram I
[02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.500]  follow her on Instagram she's amazing on
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:04.400]  Instagram I don't bazoma st. John is her
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:05.900]  name yes everybody just calls her boss
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:09.400]  though boss yeah and that would I think
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:10.800]  that would you know that sort of
[02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:12.700]  scratches the same itch of the same
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:14.300]  people coming out over and over again
[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:17.300]  you know Schiller hasn't been on stage
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:22.700]  for the WWDC keynote in two years I I
[02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:25.000]  like it when Schiller is up there I love
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.400]  it when he's up there but I kind of I
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:28.300]  kind of like it I like this thing where
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:30.100]  it's only for the products now and not
[02:18:30.100 --> 02:18:35.100]  for WWDC yeah but if they did if they do
[02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:37.600]  side I love seeing Phil introduce
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:41.400]  products already have a MacBook who else
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.600]  would do it at that's interesting yeah
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:46.500]  but I think he can introduce more than
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:50.100]  that right I just to me it's it the the
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:51.900]  keynote kind of seems empty without Phil
[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:55.200]  yeah what about a Jeff Williams
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:57.000]  announcement I wouldn't be surprised if
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.600]  there's another you know like a yes like
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.600]  the the medical research initiatives you
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.100]  know what I mean it's like those sort of
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:06.800]  things that's what he's in charge of
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:07.400]  yep
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.600]  well he's Jeff Williams is in charge of
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:15.100]  an awful lot of shit you know what I
[02:19:15.100 --> 02:19:17.300]  mean I sometimes I have I have trouble
[02:19:17.300 --> 02:19:19.900]  just getting two meals a day and you
[02:19:19.900 --> 02:19:23.200]  know you know I have a lot of trouble I
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:24.900]  look at the stuff on Jeff Williams plate
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:27.100]  and I wonder how he ever sleeps I know I
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:29.300]  wouldn't be surprised one of the some of
[02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:32.600]  some of that stuff to never be surprised
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:34.600]  with that I mean they they typically do
[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:40.600]  retail updates oh oh there's a good one
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:42.600]  first appearance on stage by Angela
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:46.500]  aren'ts oh I'll take the over on that I
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:48.000]  feel like this could be it because
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.100]  there's so much going on with the stores
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.300]  right now yeah oh I'm gonna call it I'm
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:54.100]  calling it I'm bet I bet if I'm gonna
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:57.400]  bet money on Angela aren'ts on stage okay
[02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:00.100]  and I'll agree with and there's there's
[02:20:00.100 --> 02:20:03.600]  our there's our first of never before in
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:05.700]  a speaking role in a keynote that's one
[02:20:05.700 --> 02:20:07.400]  there's too much the Apple today stuff
[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:10.200]  is too big of a deal yes my impression
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:11.700]  of that Apple today stuff we didn't talk
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:12.900]  about it but we could wrap the show with
[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:16.600]  it I I think you I think I don't know if
[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:18.200]  it's gonna work out I'm not you know I
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.000]  don't know maybe it'll turn out to be a
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.600]  bust and but I think that this is the
[02:20:23.600 --> 02:20:25.800]  reason if you ask well why would
[02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:27.500]  somebody why would a woman who's the
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.800]  CEO of a major retailer like Burberry
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.100]  take the at least at the titular level
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:38.100]  the the the reduction in title from CEO
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:40.100]  to senior vice president to work at a
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:43.100]  company and you know I think that this
[02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:46.000]  is the answer to that that this is her
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.300]  sort of putting her stamp on Apple's
[02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:52.500]  retail strategy yeah I think it's a huge
[02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:54.400]  deal I could totally see that being
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.100]  something that she would get up on stage
[02:20:56.100 --> 02:20:58.000]  and talk about I mean the other way they
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.300]  would do it would be to show a movie
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:02.000]  about it you know but I would be
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.400]  surprised if she gets up on stage to
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:06.400]  talk about it me neither and I also think
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:09.600]  that we'll see something about the
[02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:13.300]  environment hmm yeah I can help that too
[02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:15.500]  they they typically do that you know
[02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:19.900]  they know so I yeah it's hard to say I
[02:21:19.900 --> 02:21:21.300]  could definitely see the show and they're
[02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:22.600]  also doing a lot of work on
[02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.300]  reconfiguring the shows I'm not the
[02:21:25.300 --> 02:21:27.800]  shows the the stores the floor layout
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:28.900]  there's an awful lot of Apple stores
[02:21:28.900 --> 02:21:30.900]  right now that are under renovation yes
[02:21:30.900 --> 02:21:33.900]  yes and some of them they're putting a
[02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:37.600]  theater back yeah right what comes
[02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:39.800]  around goes around yeah I'm change yeah
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.600]  the other thing I think they're doing is
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:45.900]  it would be interesting to ask Angela
[02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.400]  aren't about it you know is what my
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:52.100]  curiosity is that the the big trend is
[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:55.600]  overall is that retail is is fading
[02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:57.300]  there's you know there's an awful lot of
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:58.800]  malls in the country that have an awful
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:01.100]  lot of empty stores and more as more
[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:03.800]  stuff is being purchased online a lot of
[02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:08.400]  the lower range malls are empty or
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.800]  emptying and there's an opportunity I
[02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:12.800]  think Apple in some a lot of places is
[02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:15.300]  upgrading from to bigger footprint
[02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:17.400]  stores so that they can do things like
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:19.300]  put a theater space in and have more
[02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:21.700]  space devoted to these Apple today
[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:25.300]  initiatives it would be interesting to
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.700]  find out if that's if that's something
[02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:28.600]  that they see as an opportunity or is it
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:30.300]  something they see as a problem because
[02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:32.500]  even if the Apple store is doing well if
[02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:35.100]  the rest of them all is empty it's it
[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:38.200]  eventually catches up to Apple well it
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:42.400]  will but I I think that most of Apple's
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:46.100]  locations are standalone stores you know
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:48.100]  their destination oh I don't think so I
[02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:50.500]  well really no I think I think out of
[02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:53.300]  there's close to 500 of them and I think
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:58.000]  most of them are in malls huh the urban
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.600]  ones obviously aren't you know the ones
[02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:01.500]  in cities like here in Philadelphia in
[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:04.000]  New York you know yeah but I think that
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.900]  around the world that most of them are
[02:23:05.900 --> 02:23:07.900]  are in malls and I don't know that
[02:23:07.900 --> 02:23:10.200]  there's any way around that yeah I
[02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:13.700]  suppose but anyway long story short I do
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:15.300]  think that and I think that it is a
[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:17.200]  deliberate and perhaps very smart
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:19.500]  attempt to take advantage of one thing
[02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:20.800]  that Apple has that none of their
[02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:22.900]  competing companies have which is a
[02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:25.500]  venue for face-to-face human
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:27.600]  relationships between people who work
[02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:33.800]  for Apple and and are their customers
[02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:36.200]  nobody else has that Amazon I mean
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:38.600]  Amazon is obviously just tinkling with
[02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:41.100]  little bookstores and like that the cool
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:42.800]  little convenience store where there's
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.500]  nobody who works there right so they're
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:48.200]  they're tinkering with retail but even
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:49.900]  there what Amazon Amazon's most
[02:23:49.900 --> 02:23:51.300]  interesting experiment in physical
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:53.000]  retail is a store where there are no
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.300]  employees and the whole Apple today
[02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:59.000]  initiative is central around you
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.500]  learning from and talking to human
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:05.300]  beings who work for Apple it's it's the
[02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:07.200]  human relationship yeah I mean they have
[02:24:07.200 --> 02:24:08.700]  those features where you can check out
[02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:10.000]  of the Apple store we're using the app
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.400]  on the phone without ever talking to
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:14.000]  anybody but the whole point of Apple to
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.200]  debate it seems to me is about human to
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:19.700]  human relationships yeah and nobody else
[02:24:19.700 --> 02:24:23.700]  has that they do not and I I don't know
[02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:26.000]  that they that they want us no I don't
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.200]  think so either I think Apple is the
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:28.500]  only company who even sees it as
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:30.400]  something that they want I you know I
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:32.100]  don't think Google wants to ever come in
[02:24:32.100 --> 02:24:36.200]  contact with and oh god no I don't want
[02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:39.900]  to do that just interact with Google by
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:44.300]  talking to your device don't worry
[02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:47.600]  they're listening yeah all right Jim
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:49.900]  all right anything else you want to talk
[02:24:49.900 --> 02:24:52.100]  about before we sign off no it's great
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:54.000]  all right everybody can read your fine
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.700]  stuff the work of you and and your
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:59.400]  colleagues Sean King and Dave Mark over
