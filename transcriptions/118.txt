[00:00.000 --> 00:26.720]  Oh boy, I'm way into this, you have no idea how long I've been, how I've been looking
[00:26.720 --> 00:32.960]  forward to this. Is that weird? Should I not, should I play a cool? No, I don't think it's, I don't
[00:32.960 --> 00:36.560]  think it's weird at all. If anything, I feel like one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you, but I
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.080]  may have a want to talk to you about this ever since we were in Montreal last year and we were both,
[00:40.080 --> 00:44.800]  we both talked each other and to be in super excited about the watch. Is that, I feel like too many
[00:44.800 --> 00:52.480]  other people are playing it cool and they're, they're trying to receive incredible judgment. Yeah,
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.360]  and it's, and that's totally cool. Like to, you know, I think just being completely honest,
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.640]  there's a lot of things to complain about too, but I feel like, I don't know, I feel like not
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.520]  being excited about it. What's the fun in that? Oh, no, this has got, I mean, you, you got to treat
[01:07.520 --> 01:14.800]  this like Christmas. When I was probably seven years old, I got a transformer watch, a wrist watch
[01:14.800 --> 01:22.640]  that was a transformer for Hanukkah and I cried. And I feel, tears of joy. Yeah, tears of
[01:22.640 --> 01:28.960]  transformer Hanukkah joy. And I think that I, there's no reason I shouldn't have the same reaction
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.160]  literally has opposed, as opposed to the kid across the street who got a go bot watch and cried
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  because nobody wants to know what it was. It was the go bots.
[01:40.000 --> 01:49.040]  That's not. Go bots was like the original Samsung.
[01:52.480 --> 01:59.520]  So you, um, you know, you reminded me that I used to be a watch guy. I haven't, I haven't for so
[01:59.520 --> 02:06.640]  long, but when I was a kid, my grandfather was an accountant and one of his clients was a, I think
[02:06.640 --> 02:13.200]  a reseller of Casio watches. And so every, like once a year, he would hand me down the
[02:13.200 --> 02:18.960]  late, you know, like the last year's version of a data bank or whatever it was. And that, you know,
[02:18.960 --> 02:25.840]  that was just, you know, I think that was like just early gadget, gadget fetish for me. And,
[02:25.840 --> 02:31.520]  and like you said, you know, last, last, you know, your last episode with multi,
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.920]  you were talking about how inscrutable those interfaces were and how you basically had to memorize
[02:37.920 --> 02:45.840]  like the equivalent of a, of a, you know, NES. Yeah, Contra code. Yeah, just in order to like get
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.080]  to, you know, timer mode or something like that. Yeah, it was like triple click the lower right
[02:50.080 --> 02:55.200]  button to get into the mode where you can set the alarm. Yeah, which looked exactly like the mode
[02:55.200 --> 03:00.640]  for setting the time, except that there was a little tiny button like an A that would flash that
[03:00.640 --> 03:05.040]  meant, hey, this is the alarm. And then you would just have to know that you were setting the
[03:05.040 --> 03:10.480]  time for your alarm and not changing the time on your watch. Right. But once you got there, it felt
[03:10.480 --> 03:18.640]  so good. Yeah. One of the things, it's just a little thing. And I know that it's, I think I feel
[03:18.640 --> 03:25.840]  like the two main points of like the big question marks is, does it, should anybody be excited
[03:25.840 --> 03:30.960]  about Apple watch in general as just like a thing they might want to wear in the wrist. And then
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.280]  there's this whole other angle where I know that as time goes on, you say things and I keep
[03:35.280 --> 03:38.560]  seeing it on Twitter when people, you know, people like to complain on Twitter. I don't know if
[03:38.560 --> 03:42.640]  you ever noticed that. But then they'll say like, you mean, you know, and they say like, this is
[03:42.640 --> 03:46.960]  really cool thing you can do. This is a nice part of wearing the Apple watch every day. And then
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.480]  they say, you mean exactly like every other small watch on the market for the last two years.
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.560]  And it's like, okay, yeah, you know, maybe they, you know, give some points to some of these
[03:54.560 --> 03:59.520]  other guys for shipping first. I mean, but it doesn't take away that it's a nice part of the
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.680]  experience on the rest. And one of those things, one of those little things is that you never
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.840]  have to set the time on the watch. Yeah, it's like once you've paired it with your phone,
[04:07.840 --> 04:13.040]  it always just gets the time. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's one of those things that's
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.680]  completely invisible. I've not, I've not once thought about that fact, except that's just the time,
[04:17.680 --> 04:23.760]  you take it for granted because um, clocks set themselves now. That's what clocks do.
[04:23.760 --> 04:27.920]  Right. And I was thinking about that with the context of those old digital watches, like I wrote
[04:27.920 --> 04:33.040]  about from my teenage years, where I can't even remember whether some of them, and I guess I just
[04:33.040 --> 04:36.480]  went through them every couple of years, because they even back then they weren't that expensive
[04:36.480 --> 04:40.640]  by the 80s. Like in the 70s, digital watches were really expensive. And by the 80s, they were,
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.520]  you know, you get them for your eighth grade son without thinking about it. But I think that I had some
[04:46.080 --> 04:51.600]  that that you could set the month, even though it didn't show it like on the face because it
[04:51.600 --> 04:56.880]  was like too much detail, but then at least that way when like April 30th rolls around and it goes
[04:56.880 --> 05:02.960]  to May 1st, it doesn't tell you that it's the 31st. I think, but it was like you had to, it just
[05:02.960 --> 05:06.800]  was another thing you had to set though. Like if the bat like when you did change the battery and
[05:06.800 --> 05:10.640]  had to start over from scratch, you had to set so many different fields, the hour, the date,
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.920]  the time, the day, the week, you know, all this. But I, but I think at that point in technology,
[05:15.920 --> 05:23.040]  we didn't, we didn't, I don't, I this, I might be wrong about this. We weren't thinking
[05:23.040 --> 05:28.800]  far in advance to, we wanted our gadgets to know how to do things themselves. I don't, I don't
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.280]  think that I was an expectation. It was almost like, no, of course, it's like a manual transmission,
[05:33.280 --> 05:39.120]  you want that control. You want like to take out of the box, unfold the like 18 fold,
[05:39.120 --> 05:48.080]  mostly Japanese instructions. And then figure out what is the, is the code you need to get to
[05:50.480 --> 05:57.120]  to, to get to, you know, world time or something like that. Yeah, I mean, I'm, yeah, I wasn't
[05:57.120 --> 06:00.720]  even complaining about it. And I didn't complain about it when I did it. I thought it was a cool
[06:00.720 --> 06:04.720]  feature. I was like, hey, this is great. This way when, you know, a short month rolls around,
[06:04.720 --> 06:09.520]  I won't have to worry about it. I'll, I'll go through the hassle now of setting everything
[06:09.520 --> 06:14.560]  so that I don't have to do it again. Yeah. So are, are people asking you, I mean,
[06:14.560 --> 06:20.400]  obviously people on this, people online, obviously, but people in the world, are they seeing
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.680]  your watch and saying, Hey, what do you, what do you think of that? Yeah, totally. I'm, I'm about,
[06:26.880 --> 06:33.840]  I haven't kept to exact count, but if I had to guess, I would guess that I'm 23 out of 25 for
[06:33.840 --> 06:38.960]  when I use Apple pay at Whole Foods. And that's probably about right, because it's been a little
[06:38.960 --> 06:44.800]  bit over a month. And I go there just about every day. Um, I'd say about 23 out of 25 times, the cash
[06:44.800 --> 06:49.920]  year has commented on it. Even though I'm definitely trying to do it as subtly as possible,
[06:49.920 --> 06:54.560]  because I'm trying, as I'm playing a game where I'm trying not to be noticed using the watch
[06:54.560 --> 07:00.880]  to Apple pay, and yet they inevitably notice. And out of the, the two times that they didn't,
[07:00.880 --> 07:05.520]  the one time it was a cashier who I'd had before. And she was, she just kind of gave me the,
[07:05.520 --> 07:10.480]  oh, you're the guy who already has the Apple watch. And then it was one time when a cashier didn't
[07:10.480 --> 07:15.760]  didn't make note of it. And she, she batted her eyelashes and you moved on. She was clearly impressed
[07:17.120 --> 07:23.040]  with your prowess technological prowess. I used it, I used Apple pay this morning for the first time,
[07:23.040 --> 07:28.320]  because I, you know, I've been preparing to be on, on, on your show. And I wanted to do everything
[07:28.320 --> 07:34.400]  I could possibly do, like exercise, for instance. Just as all I knew that, you know, got the
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.760]  well-rounded experience, this morning, I used Apple pay with the watch. And my go-to for Apple pay,
[07:39.760 --> 07:44.400]  because I never remember where it's going to be, is I go to McDonald's. So I need to make
[07:44.400 --> 07:54.160]  McDonald's. I got my, a white delight McMuffin. Use the watch. Couldn't be easier. Cashier could,
[07:54.160 --> 08:02.640]  it did not give a shit. I paid, it, you know, I guess it worked like it was supposed to.
[08:03.280 --> 08:07.920]  I took my sandwich out to the parking lot, ate it in the parking lot and went to work.
[08:08.720 --> 08:13.680]  And now I feel prepared like with the, like I have no extra commentary on that experience,
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.320]  except that it worked exactly like it's supposed to. And it makes you feel like I've got a,
[08:18.320 --> 08:25.600]  I've got a currency device on my, on my wrist. That's the thing is that I'm noticing is,
[08:25.600 --> 08:31.040]  is just how all encompassing it is as a device. And I feel like what they've done is they've
[08:31.040 --> 08:37.440]  just prepared, like all of the pieces have kind of culminated in this thing that you now strap to
[08:37.440 --> 08:43.920]  yourself. Yeah. And I, I can kind of say, I know, and this might be where you're going to,
[08:43.920 --> 08:49.040]  but I can kind of see how they've already laid like the groundwork for like the Apple watch from five
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.360]  years from now. Like not even just, not even just like a 2.0 from next year, but I'm thinking like
[08:55.360 --> 09:02.080]  a lot further down the road where all of the things that it doesn't have, like it doesn't do
[09:02.080 --> 09:07.040]  cellular networking on its own. And it doesn't have its own storage where you can keep all of your
[09:07.040 --> 09:12.480]  videos and stuff like that. I could just see where this would have it all. And then you would,
[09:12.480 --> 09:19.200]  you know, you could like have like your, your whole iCloud thing. Totally. Um, I was, I was,
[09:19.200 --> 09:25.440]  yeah, I mean, definitely that's where I wanted to get this conversation to, um, mostly because like,
[09:25.440 --> 09:32.320]  you know, just in a, as a, partly as a response to people who are basically just like being negative
[09:32.320 --> 09:42.480]  nellies about where it is now, without the presence of mind to remember what iPhone version one
[09:43.520 --> 09:49.600]  is what was what it was and what it was, what it was missing and, and how it iterated and how,
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.920]  you know, in the, in the, in the, in the next eight years it got to this incredible all encompassing tool
[09:55.920 --> 10:02.240]  that almost kind of feels like it's fully matured. And the people don't necessarily step back
[10:02.240 --> 10:09.760]  outside of themselves and say, okay, this is what this device is now. I wonder what it's going to
[10:09.760 --> 10:14.960]  be five years from now, like you said. Yeah. I, I've tried to remember some of the stuff that
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.720]  wasn't in iPhone 1.0. I know there was no notifications. Like, so you couldn't slide down from
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.040]  the top to see any kind of notifications and there was no control center from the bottom.
[10:25.040 --> 10:29.440]  It was really just the home screen of apps and it was one home screen because there were,
[10:29.440 --> 10:34.000]  there were no other apps. And you would just hit the home button to go to the home screen and hit
[10:34.000 --> 10:39.680]  an app to go to an app and that was it. Like that was the scope of the whole system. You're either
[10:39.680 --> 10:44.880]  in an app. And if you're in an app, the app had the whole screen and otherwise you were on the
[10:44.880 --> 10:48.240]  home screen and then you would use that to launch an app and that was it. And it was part of the
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.840]  brilliance of the design is how simple that was. Absolutely. And it almost had to be constrained
[10:53.840 --> 11:00.720]  in order to just teach us what the thing was. If so, we could get like sort of acclimated to the
[11:00.720 --> 11:07.520]  language and then, and then they could start to grow it out. And I wonder how you extend that to
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.960]  the watch and what it's, I mean, there are things about the UI right now that I don't get naturally.
[11:12.960 --> 11:21.120]  And I don't, and they kind of annoy me, you know, like the, the app, the home screen of full of apps
[11:21.120 --> 11:26.560]  is fun to play with, but I don't necessarily feel like it's perfectly natural. Yeah.
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.920]  No. And I'm all, I still, even a month in them, I tap the wrong app. Right. Yeah. The tap,
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.160]  tap, tap targets are, are weird. They're not, maybe they're a little too small, but they're
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.560]  definitely too close to each other. That's the big, the bigger problem isn't necessarily the size.
[11:44.560 --> 11:49.040]  Because I did, like I said, this with multi or with Joanne Stern, I actually took out a ruler and
[11:49.040 --> 11:54.720]  measured and they are a quarter of an inch, which is like the minimum, you know, if you, it's just
[11:54.720 --> 11:59.840]  basically the minimum size for a tap target. But the problem is they're right next to each other,
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.320]  whereas like on the iPhone, when you'd have like quarter inch tap targets, you'd still put some
[12:04.320 --> 12:11.680]  spacing between them. Right. And when you get it right, it feels like magic, right? But that,
[12:11.680 --> 12:15.600]  but unless it happens all the time that you get it right, it's not real magic. It's just the
[12:15.600 --> 12:23.600]  illusion of magic. I feel like, I mean, one of the things that I realized is I use overcast a lot.
[12:23.600 --> 12:29.200]  That's probably one of the most frequently used app on the watch. And overcast just would by default
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.200]  when the, when all my apps came over, when I sunk with the watch, overcast ended up to the right
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.400]  side, the very edge, to the very right edge. And I realized, oh, that's an easier tap target.
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.600]  I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's mentally or. No, yeah, because physically.
[12:47.600 --> 12:53.040]  No, that makes sense though because it's sort of like a, it fits his law, right? Where the
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.400]  the menu bar on the Mac is easier to click on because you can, you can just slide your arrow
[12:58.400 --> 13:02.800]  all the way to the top and you can't go too far. There's a similar, I think there's a similar
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.000]  usability advantage to being at the edge of that app cloud because you can't, you can get sloppy
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.800]  on the side, you know what I mean? Yep. And I guess that was the story of my college years as well,
[13:14.800 --> 13:21.920]  sloppy on the side. So there's, and, and, and clock in the middle, that's what they called
[13:21.920 --> 13:29.360]  right, clock, clock in the middle. So I guess it does that work, does that work in theory and
[13:29.360 --> 13:33.920]  in practice that the clock being in the middle makes it an easier tap target. Then do you just
[13:33.920 --> 13:39.280]  kind of hit a bullseye? I don't know because I almost never go back to the clock. Like, oh,
[13:39.280 --> 13:47.680]  really? Yeah, I just assume that and to me, it's, it's like the most under reported thing and
[13:47.680 --> 13:53.520]  I think people just sort of get it. But it's like the me, the thing you have to get over with is
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.880]  the in this thinking that it don't treat it like a little iPhone on your wrist. And in the iPhone,
[13:58.880 --> 14:02.800]  whatever you would last doing when you unlock your iPhone, there it is again when you come back
[14:02.800 --> 14:10.080]  with a watch just when you're done with whatever, like maybe you wanted to change to a new podcast
[14:10.080 --> 14:13.920]  because you're using an overcast. And then when you switch and you queue it up and you now,
[14:13.920 --> 14:17.920]  you've got the new episode of whatever you want to listen to playing in your earbuds,
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.160]  then you just put your wrist down and you're done. And next time you want to go to your watch,
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.280]  it's just right back on the watch face. You know, like you never have to clean up as soon as you're
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.240]  done doing what it is that you did on your watch, just put your wrist down and trust that it'll,
[14:32.240 --> 14:38.480]  it'll come back to the watch face on its own. Yeah, that makes sense. Do you have what are things
[14:38.480 --> 14:45.760]  that you've experienced having done? So I remember when the first iPhone came out, I had these
[14:45.760 --> 14:53.840]  moments all the time of like, oh, I just did something like I just, I got a link in an email,
[14:53.840 --> 14:59.120]  I clicked the link, it opened up in mobile safari, I watched a video, and then I closed it,
[14:59.120 --> 15:05.200]  and I thought I could never have done that before, you know, six months ago. That, you know,
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.760]  I just did something that I, that I had this technology enabled that I could never have done before
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.520]  it existed. And I feel like I'm having sort of similar things, like just those, those realizations
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.000]  of with the watch of, oh, this is why this exists. This is one of those little vignettes that
[15:20.000 --> 15:28.800]  they put in their commercials. Yeah. I think, you know, and again, I know that there are other
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.320]  smart watches or whatever you want to call them that get text messages, you know, trans,
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.480]  it's happened between your, you know, your phone and your watch. So I realized that it's not
[15:36.480 --> 15:41.760]  necessarily exclusive to Apple Watch, but I've tried it. I've have the pebble and I've worn the
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.480]  pebble. And it's, it's a little different. Number one, the Apple Watch is pretty reliable. I find the
[15:46.480 --> 15:51.600]  Bluetooth connection to be really good. And with pebble, it was always flicking out, which
[15:51.600 --> 15:57.920]  probably isn't pebble's fault. It's probably the limits of third party apps versus Apple getting
[15:57.920 --> 16:03.680]  to have, you know, tightest possible integration at the OS level on both the watch and the phone.
[16:05.520 --> 16:09.520]  But it's pretty cool when I like, I do all the grocery shopping. That's why I go to Whole Foods.
[16:09.520 --> 16:16.320]  So I'm at Whole Foods and I'm walking around and I feel my wrist go and Amy says, can you get
[16:16.320 --> 16:21.600]  OJ two? And then I don't even, you know, I don't know. It's just, it's nice because then, you know,
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.160]  you don't have to go in your pocket and get out your phone. You don't have to take it out of your
[16:26.160 --> 16:30.800]  pocket. Is that what you said? Yeah. Sorry, my headphones broke for a second. No, that's okay.
[16:30.800 --> 16:34.480]  Hey, let me take a time out here just real quick and let you know that if I start sounding like
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.520]  a terrible robot or something, tell me right away because it's a USB problem, not a Skype problem.
[16:41.360 --> 16:47.600]  Not a personal problem. But, but I had to, uh, episode a few, I should, what I should do, of course,
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.080]  is just as soon as we're done recording, go to Amazon and buy a new microphone. And instead,
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.240]  uh, I started to show and then realize halfway through that I should have told the guest,
[16:56.240 --> 17:01.360]  hey, if I start sounding bad, tell me right away. Don't just, don't be, don't be polite and say,
[17:01.360 --> 17:06.480]  I don't care. Because it means my audio recording is bad too. All right. Oh, that sucks.
[17:06.480 --> 17:13.040]  Oh, so you've like, you've blown. Yeah, it was like the last half hour of the episode with
[17:13.040 --> 17:20.960]  Serenity Caldwell. And so I recreated my audio. I played it. Listen, and did it again. And I think it
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.000]  came out pretty good. I think it actually made me, it like, I, I tighten up a lot of my arguments.
[17:26.560 --> 17:32.240]  That's, um, the, the French call it a spree to scale the A. So you could basically just, um, go
[17:32.240 --> 17:38.320]  back and retroactively say smarter things. Yeah, exactly. That's perfect. That's exactly what it was
[17:38.320 --> 17:43.840]  like. Okay, I'm going to do that after we record, but it was the biggest paid of the ass ever.
[17:43.840 --> 17:50.560]  I'm sure you can well imagine what it's like to, to, to have to redub it. And the cross talk was
[17:50.560 --> 18:00.080]  just, you know, horrifying. Okay. Um, but, uh, so which, what, what watch are you wearing? Okay,
[18:00.080 --> 18:07.840]  so what I ordered is, um, the 42 millimeter space black steel with the black links. Right.
[18:07.840 --> 18:13.600]  I'm, and I'm not, like I said, I'm not a watch guy. So even that felt like he was bordering on a
[18:13.600 --> 18:21.840]  little too dressy for me. Um, but as, as I, as I think is, is a common, that one's being delayed in
[18:21.840 --> 18:27.680]  shipment pretty heavily. And I ordered it, you know, right after the store opened. Yeah, I ordered
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.800]  the same one. And I ordered it first. I ordered it before Amy's or Jonas's or any of the bands,
[18:32.800 --> 18:36.960]  and it still has not shipped. I don't believe that one has shipped to anybody,
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.800]  but I could be wrong. Good. It could be wrong, but it doesn't seem like it. I haven't seen
[18:40.800 --> 18:46.400]  anybody post pictures of, of such a watch. Yeah, no, it's weird to feel the privilege of a
[18:46.400 --> 18:51.280]  delayed shipment. I don't know, like, just the fact like there were, does that make it more precious
[18:51.280 --> 18:57.680]  when it actually comes? I don't know. Well, and it put, and I, you know, I, I am in no place to
[18:57.680 --> 19:03.360]  complain because I've had the regular steel link bracelet for five weeks now. So it's, is that
[19:03.360 --> 19:07.920]  the one you're wearing? Yeah, that's the one that's the review unit from ample. People have asked,
[19:07.920 --> 19:13.840]  I guess I should answer is that the typical review unit period from Apple is 60 days. I actually
[19:13.840 --> 19:18.240]  haven't even looked at the thing that I signed, but it's always been, if it doesn't matter whether
[19:18.240 --> 19:23.280]  it's like a new Mac or a phone or tablet or, you know, iPad or anything, it's always 60 days.
[19:23.280 --> 19:29.280]  And they don't come knocking after 60 if you're still testing something. I mean, I never like
[19:29.280 --> 19:32.960]  use them as my own, although I guess I kind of am with the watch because I'm still wearing it,
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.280]  but it's, my thought is, oh, well, it's their fault that the one I ordered is delayed. I'll just keep
[19:37.840 --> 19:41.840]  wearing it. But I think that, you know, they would even rather have me still wearing it and being
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.000]  able to write about it than, you know, what, what does the watch mean to them for me to send it back?
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.400]  But anyway, I'll, I'll have this watch until mine comes and then I'll package it back up and send it
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.120]  back to them. Well, that's great. It's a, it's a loaner. They give you a loaner just like your insurance
[19:55.120 --> 20:02.800]  company. Oh, so my insurance company is, is Roxanna's watch, which I ordered for her shortly
[20:02.800 --> 20:10.320]  after mine. And actually everybody on the team here at Sandwich got one. And so they kind of staggered
[20:10.320 --> 20:18.480]  in, um, I think JP's came first. He got the millenies loop. Yeah, it's really handsome. Um, but she,
[20:18.480 --> 20:25.920]  so I ordered her a 38 millimeter one, uh, steel, uh, stainless steel with the black sport band.
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.880]  And as soon as it came, I just said, this is mine now. And what are you going to do? And she doesn't,
[20:32.880 --> 20:38.800]  honestly, she's, she's very sweet. And she did, she, it's not important to her. She's just letting you
[20:38.800 --> 20:43.520]  wear it until I, you know, until I get mine. And also I wanted to just like, I want it, it was so
[20:43.520 --> 20:49.200]  important to me that I get to spend time with it. Um, you know, get to know it a little bit better
[20:49.200 --> 20:56.480]  on an intimate level. Um, so that I could start, uh, you know, let's say, let's say conceivably,
[20:56.480 --> 21:02.480]  this is what I do for a living, I guess. Um, so it was important to me that I know what the watch is
[21:02.480 --> 21:10.480]  like. Yeah. I mean, in all seriousness, it is absolutely not inconceivable that you guys will be
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.400]  writing, directing and shooting, uh, a promotional video for some new product, part of which
[21:16.400 --> 21:21.440]  product's experience is a watch extension. Totally. I can't wait for it to happen. We haven't
[21:21.440 --> 21:30.640]  done it yet, but now we, we certainly can. Right. And it's, you know, uh, I, I, you know, you do,
[21:30.640 --> 21:37.040]  you, but you have to use it to get it. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And so I've got the 38, uh, watch
[21:37.040 --> 21:41.600]  face on and it's a little small for me. I think it's a little tiny. And not because it looks tiny or
[21:41.600 --> 21:46.960]  dainty, like, you know, like, like you were saying it, it looks fine, but I want a bigger screen, I
[21:46.960 --> 21:54.000]  think. Yeah. Like a bigger screen. I don't, I, I have actually no concept of how much bigger the
[21:54.000 --> 22:00.880]  42 is going to look and feel on my wrist, but I know even incrementally, what is that? Four millimeters
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.800]  out of it is like nearly a 10 per, oh, it's a little bit more than a 10% increase, right? Yeah. But
[22:06.800 --> 22:13.840]  it's somehow, uh, my guess is with you going from 38 to 42, when yours shows up, you're going to
[22:13.840 --> 22:17.120]  be like, you're going to have like 15 minutes where you're a little worried. You think this might
[22:17.120 --> 22:21.760]  be too big. And then like, but then like 20 minutes later, you're like, oh, no, this is right,
[22:22.320 --> 22:27.440]  which brings me to a strange phenomenon, which is one of those first, you know, uh, just kind of
[22:27.440 --> 22:32.960]  like startling realizations that I had, having spent very minimal time with the watch,
[22:32.960 --> 22:37.520]  it's just like, and I am talking about maybe 10, 15 minutes of having the watch on my hand
[22:37.520 --> 22:42.880]  after I paired it and I sunk it and put the phone back in my pocket. The next opportunity I had
[22:42.880 --> 22:48.240]  to take the phone out, it felt like a giant screen. Like, did you have that experience too? Or
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.560]  your phone came out and you're like, whoa, this is like a flat screen that I just took out of my
[22:52.560 --> 22:59.440]  pocket. Yeah, a little bit, um, especially if you're trying to, you know, and, and I know it's,
[22:59.440 --> 23:06.320]  it, I don't think you're supposed to be dictating large amounts of text on the watch, but it's
[23:06.320 --> 23:12.320]  definitely works for texting. And I think that, you know, that the Siri transcription is really,
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.960]  really good, including when you're out on cellular. Yeah, it's great. Um, I don't, I don't,
[23:18.960 --> 23:23.040]  I haven't used it a whole lot. I mean, I've, I've used it a little bit, but you know, there's
[23:23.040 --> 23:32.560]  the whole kind of, um, social, uh, social acceptability of, of dictating into your watch in public
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.200]  or dictating into your phone even, like, if you're at the market, you don't want to talk to
[23:37.200 --> 23:42.080]  your thing because you sound like a dick, right? Right. I feel like that's the case. Do it,
[23:42.080 --> 23:47.920]  you like, if you get a thing on your watch, if you get a text on your watch from Amy and you're
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.960]  at the market, you're at Whole Foods and you're not the only one in the aisle. Do you like, do you
[23:52.960 --> 23:58.640]  respond or do you do like an emoticon, even though I'm, or I'm an emoji, even though emojis are for
[23:58.640 --> 24:06.960]  children? Uh, I'm kind of, I'm a little self-conscious about it, but I try to, I just try to start
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.160]  walking in a direction where I'm away from other customers and, and, and I try to keep my voice
[24:12.160 --> 24:17.280]  down and cut my hands, but I do cut my hands around the, the watch, but I realize that it does
[24:17.280 --> 24:22.800]  kind of make you look inspirational. Like, you know, I mean, I hear going off in whispering into
[24:22.800 --> 24:29.360]  your own rest. Like, because I, the thing I'm self-conscious about is I don't want to be loud talking
[24:29.360 --> 24:34.320]  into it. Like, I'll, I'll only do it in a way that it seems as though strangers aren't going to hear
[24:34.320 --> 24:39.120]  what it is that I'm dictating, even though that if they looked at me and gave two seconds of thought
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.160]  about it, they'd realize I must be talking to some kind of gadget. But as long as they can't really
[24:44.160 --> 24:48.560]  hear me and I'm not intruding on their conversations and I don't mind and I feel like it's the way
[24:48.560 --> 24:52.960]  the future. And got, yeah, I knew it is the way of the future. And God bless you for being polite
[24:52.960 --> 24:58.720]  and considerate about it. Um, and especially thinking about how many people probably out there
[24:58.720 --> 25:04.640]  and in the world wouldn't be and also like think about how far we've come that it used to be
[25:04.640 --> 25:12.480]  like people loud talking to their Bluetooth earpiece or whatever that word. And I, I also think that
[25:12.480 --> 25:17.760]  it's, you know, and it just became acceptable. And it's just, you can't go anywhere in the
[25:17.760 --> 25:23.120]  Western world without seeing it. But at first 10 years ago, it was really weird when you would see
[25:23.840 --> 25:33.040]  grown adults like in public, uh, thumb typing into it three inch device with, with all of their
[25:33.040 --> 25:38.000]  attention on it. Like it just was a weird thing to be doing in public is sitting there pecking away
[25:38.000 --> 25:44.080]  in electronic device, like, you know, like an eight year old on a Game Boy. And, but yeah, but you're
[25:44.080 --> 25:50.080]  not, but now it's, it's, it's everywhere. Right now it's just something we do. And hopefully that,
[25:50.080 --> 25:56.800]  the idea is that, um, just like is in that movie, her, where you see people on the subway and
[25:56.800 --> 26:03.520]  everybody's whispering softly into their earpiece or whatever, um, that that just becomes a way of
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.720]  life and, and nobody thinks twice about it. I think it's, hopefully it's going to happen. Um,
[26:09.440 --> 26:15.040]  and hopefully it doesn't create a cacophony of, of environmental, you know, pollution.
[26:15.040 --> 26:22.480]  Yeah. Um, did you like her? Yeah, I love that. I loved it. I, I loved it too. Yeah. Is it,
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.800]  it hit me deeply on an emotional level, but also it's just fun for future thinking people.
[26:28.800 --> 26:31.840]  Yeah. Hold that thought. Let's come back to that. I mean, I mean, to take a break here and thank
[26:31.840 --> 26:35.120]  our first sponsor and we'll come back and talk about her. Cause I do think, I think the watch
[26:35.120 --> 26:40.800]  is a step in that direction. Yeah. Um, it's a brand new sponsor. I'm really proud to have
[26:40.800 --> 26:48.240]  these guys on board rails tutorial, Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartle. So if you dabbled a
[26:48.240 --> 26:52.720]  little bit at your web web web developer, uh, but you really want to know how things actually
[26:52.720 --> 26:58.720]  work under the hood or maybe you've tried your hand at programming, uh, maybe in language like
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.280]  PHP or something like that and found it to be too messy to an elegant too much like you have to do
[27:03.280 --> 27:08.560]  everything yourself. Um, well, if you ask around about resources on learning web development,
[27:08.560 --> 27:13.920]  you'll probably hear about rubies on rail tutorials. Sometimes just called the Michael Hartle tutorial,
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.640]  which teaches you how to develop web applications, surprise, surprise, built with rails,
[27:18.640 --> 27:24.480]  the framework used by sites like GitHub, Twitter, Disney, Airbnb. I mean, if we started listening
[27:24.480 --> 27:28.960]  all the sites that are built on Ruby on Rails will be here for the rest of the show. Um, been around
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.840]  for years, probably at least a decade now that I think about it, um, cause we were building stuff
[27:33.840 --> 27:39.040]  on joint on rails back 10 years ago. Um, so first of all, here's the thing you gotta learn about,
[27:39.040 --> 27:44.240]  learn about this tutorial. It's free. The entire book is free online at the website rails
[27:44.240 --> 27:51.040]  tutorial dot org, uh, not behind a paywall or a sign up ball. Um, you can just go there and read
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.120]  the thing for free. Uh, for those of you who want to watch step by step, how to make rails web
[27:57.120 --> 28:06.080]  apps, there's also a nearly 20 hour screencast series available for purchase. Um, you can also purchase
[28:06.080 --> 28:13.600]  epub, uh, Moby, Moby is the, uh, the Kindle format and PDF versions of the book available for purchase as
[28:13.600 --> 28:17.200]  well. So you want to read it for free, go to your web browser, go to rails tutorial dot org, read for
[28:17.200 --> 28:22.160]  free. You want to get the epub version. You want to get the screencast. That's where he makes his money.
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.920]  Uh, really well worth it. Super, super well respected. Um, so many people have learned a program
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.240]  from this tutorial. So if that's building websites or learning rails, even if you already know
[28:32.240 --> 28:38.800]  some other framework is something you want to do. Uh, this is a great way to get started by the end
[28:38.800 --> 28:42.400]  of the tutorial. Here's what you will have created. You'll have the source code and you'll have
[28:42.400 --> 28:48.960]  deployed a full Twitter style micro blog rails application, uh, including the ability to sign up
[28:48.960 --> 28:54.800]  and authenticate users, uh, and create a feed of their posts. Great example program. Great
[28:54.800 --> 28:58.480]  type of thing that teaches you all the basics you need for any kind of thing like that with,
[28:58.480 --> 29:04.160]  you know, user accounts and authentication and stuff like that. Uh, where do you go? I told you
[29:04.160 --> 29:09.520]  the website already rails tutorial dot org, but go there and add slash Gruber. My last name,
[29:09.520 --> 29:15.920]  go to rails tutorial dot org slash Gruber. And by using that code, they'll know you came from the
[29:15.920 --> 29:23.440]  show and you will save 15% off with that coupon code, just my last name Gruber. So my thanks to rails
[29:23.440 --> 29:30.000]  tutorial, uh, by Michael Hartle, uh, go check them out if you want to learn how to make great web apps.
[29:30.000 --> 29:40.880]  So her I thought it's so I think it's going to hold up really well. I like the movie and I think
[29:40.880 --> 29:46.640]  even where 20 years from now, when we're past the point they're projecting to technologically.
[29:46.640 --> 29:50.320]  And so there's obviously they're going to have made some mistakes. I think it's going to look
[29:50.320 --> 29:56.160]  pretty good in hindsight though, sort of like the way 2001 seems great. Sure, or even or
[29:56.160 --> 30:01.280]  uh, Blade Runner. Like the passions are all sort of like weighted toward that era, weighted toward
[30:01.280 --> 30:06.240]  the early 80s with the shoulder pads and the angles and whatnot. Just like the highway said
[30:06.240 --> 30:12.880]  pants and her are kind of weighted toward 2013 or 2014. Uh, I think it'll hold up and it'll
[30:12.880 --> 30:18.880]  sort of be emblematic of, of, of our version of futurism. Yeah. And I feel like, I feel like
[30:18.880 --> 30:23.120]  the thing that they got right and that Apple is clearly moving towards is that your gadgets
[30:23.120 --> 30:29.840]  still totally matter as much as ever. But uh, your identity and your treatment, they're all just
[30:29.840 --> 30:37.120]  front ends to like a cloud based system. You know, and you just pick the size that you want at
[30:37.120 --> 30:43.680]  this moment. Right. And then, and, and what they did in her was they even removed a like a lot
[30:43.680 --> 30:51.360]  of the visual component and just had it be so, so reliant on, on voice and sound, um, which was
[30:51.360 --> 30:56.400]  an interesting way to go. And I don't, I don't know how, how far we're going to go in that direction,
[30:56.400 --> 31:02.960]  especially with like, was Siri and the state that it's in now. In terms of it's like, it's ability
[31:02.960 --> 31:09.280]  to understand us and communicate back. Um, I thought it was, it was interesting and also like,
[31:09.280 --> 31:14.720]  just as a storytelling element, by not inundating the, the technology with visuals,
[31:14.720 --> 31:22.880]  they allowed the, um, like the human elements to, to take more of a front seat. Yeah. And I feel like
[31:22.880 --> 31:29.760]  it's, um, like the touch components on the watch play into that too, where it's not about what
[31:29.760 --> 31:34.960]  you're looking at. It's, you know, some other sense. And it, you know, and, and like with her,
[31:34.960 --> 31:40.320]  a lot of the, you know, and cinematic cinematic, cinematically, it has to be a can't be touch.
[31:40.320 --> 31:45.920]  Right. I mean, at least not with the display outputs that we have at the moment. Um,
[31:48.720 --> 31:52.640]  although I guess you can imagine some kind of game that ties into like an Apple watch and like
[31:52.640 --> 31:56.480]  rumbles on your wrist at certain points in a movie, like the way that a rumble patent a video
[31:56.480 --> 31:59.840]  game would. So maybe something like that is coming now that I think about it off the top of my head.
[31:59.840 --> 32:05.520]  But, uh, you know, it just had to be verbal because it, that makes for cinnamon and let's
[32:05.520 --> 32:12.640]  Scarlett Johansson, you know, truly act. Um, basically the best vocal interface in the world.
[32:12.640 --> 32:21.840]  Like her voice was, um, just like representative of what technology, AI should sound like
[32:22.720 --> 32:27.440]  really without being a creepy purve about it. Like, yeah, that's what I would want my robot to sound
[32:27.440 --> 32:34.080]  like to. Yeah. Um, but to me, it was the interaction that the characters had with the technology was so
[32:34.080 --> 32:38.000]  ambient and, you know, you didn't have to break stride while you were getting off the train to
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.840]  walk your office building and something, some kind of notification would come in. You don't break
[32:41.840 --> 32:47.440]  stride. And that to me is what the touch on the wrist helps to enable. Absolutely. Just
[32:48.480 --> 32:53.760]  yeah, it's, it's there. You just kind of ambiently feel it and like in a tactile way. Um,
[32:53.760 --> 32:58.880]  it's like, what, like, what do you feel like? How's the, how's the tactic engine holding up for
[32:58.880 --> 33:05.520]  you? Do you enjoy it? I do. I enjoyed a lot. And like, more and more as time goes on, I've got
[33:05.520 --> 33:11.360]  my watch the sound off all the time. I never, it's some of the sounds are too annoying. And I find
[33:11.360 --> 33:16.880]  that they're not necessary. Right. Um, I haven't really learned to distinguish between what the
[33:16.880 --> 33:22.480]  different sounds and the different patterns and everything mean. I think universally they just mean
[33:22.480 --> 33:28.640]  hey, look over here. Um, and I, you know, we're glance over here, rather, but I, but it's never
[33:28.640 --> 33:33.520]  a displeasing feeling to like, just have a small, like, little minute tap. Even if it happens,
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.440]  whatever, 10 times in an hour or something or even, yeah, because something's going up like some
[33:39.440 --> 33:44.720]  group chat that you're on is blown up and is getting messages, you know, a freaking barrage of
[33:44.720 --> 33:48.560]  messages from colleagues or something like that. Right. I mean, if you're doing something else
[33:48.560 --> 33:53.120]  important, like, like recording a podcast and like, and, and your wrist is blowing up, then that's
[33:53.120 --> 33:58.960]  maybe not as, uh, not quite not quite as fun. But I, I, for the first few days after I had, I was
[33:58.960 --> 34:04.480]  wearing the watch, I was, I found myself wanting more taps. Like I wanted, like what I'd be driving
[34:04.480 --> 34:11.200]  and I turned on navigation, um, even though I know exactly how the hell did get to where I'm going,
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.080]  it turned on navigation just because it's kind of fun to get 12 taps, um, to turn right or
[34:16.080 --> 34:21.120]  something. Yeah, that physically pleasing of a sensation. I forget if I talked to, I know I
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.600]  didn't write about it, but it may be a minute, but I did. I got driving directions to my accountant
[34:25.600 --> 34:31.600]  last month. And so this was to get my taxes done in the during fireball LLC type, you know, so
[34:31.600 --> 34:38.800]  whole afternoon. Um, and it's, I don't know, maybe I had a 20, 20 to 30 minute drive outside the city.
[34:39.440 --> 34:44.240]  Uh, it was actually the first time I was driving with the, I think, um, and I wanted to test
[34:44.240 --> 34:47.200]  the directions. Now I've been going to the same account for years and years and years, so I know
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.200]  how to get there, but I wanted to try the directions, but it was actually kind of an amazing,
[34:52.000 --> 34:55.280]  and one of those, like, I know people do this every day, but I don't drive every day, so it
[34:55.280 --> 35:01.760]  was a little science fiction to me is, um, westbound out of Philadelphia. There's really only one
[35:01.760 --> 35:04.800]  road. It's called the school school expressway. And it's called the school school expressway,
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.280]  because it goes right along the path of the school river. Um, and knowing how to spell the word
[35:09.280 --> 35:17.840]  school school is a true test of being in Philadelphia, SCU, YL, K I L L, um, old Indian name. Anyway,
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.960]  you just go out, but anyway, it's, it's an notoriously bad road though, because it's a lot of,
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.360]  a lot of the way it's only two lanes in each direction, and so any little accident, and it just
[35:27.360 --> 35:33.680]  dies. Uh, and it ended up, there was some kind of tractor trailer accident earlier in the morning,
[35:33.680 --> 35:40.240]  and it had been shut down for a while, and Siri gave me what I thought was crazy directions. Um,
[35:40.240 --> 35:44.160]  she just get me off the school school, almost as soon as I got on it. And I thought, well, I'll just go
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.400]  her way. And as soon as I took that exit, and I looked ahead from what she'd steered me away from,
[35:48.400 --> 35:51.680]  I was like, oh my god, I would have, there's no way I would have made the appointment. I would have
[35:51.680 --> 35:56.400]  had to like, and trying to reschedule an appointment with your accountant when it's already,
[35:56.400 --> 35:59.440]  I don't know, it was like April 4th or something like that. It's like, you're already, you know,
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.880]  I mean, so he would have helped me out, because if it was long, but it's still, I would have felt
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.640]  like it, I could dirt back. You don't, you don't stand your accountant up in early April. Um,
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.880]  so she took me this different way where I've never been before, and I really didn't know where I
[36:12.880 --> 36:16.800]  was going. And so I, I didn't know at the time what the difference between the left and right
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.720]  taps were, but, um, it was enough that I just felt something, and you could just glance at your
[36:22.720 --> 36:28.000]  wrist and, you know, and it would say 600 feet make a left. And it was great, I thought.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.480]  Oh, yeah, it's great. And, and then the, the display that the, the, what you actually see on the
[36:34.480 --> 36:40.480]  wrist is, um, is so minimal that it doesn't get in the way. You're, you can, you can sort of interpret
[36:40.480 --> 36:46.480]  it at a glance because you're supposed to be driving. And most of the experience is audio, and, um,
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.600]  you know, I typically when I'm driving, I use ways, I put, I mount my iPhone to the dash thing
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.720]  and I use ways and it, ways has better directions. It's smarter about traffic. It's smarter in
[36:58.720 --> 37:04.320]  so many ways, but the audio quality sounds like it's coming through the telephone rather than,
[37:04.880 --> 37:11.280]  you know, like a built-in library of, of, of, or an internal audio engine. I don't know what
[37:11.280 --> 37:16.480]  that I don't know technically, whether that's true, except ways sounds like garbage and, uh,
[37:16.480 --> 37:23.840]  Apple Maps sounds amazing. Um, so to go back and get directions from the watch sounds amazing
[37:23.840 --> 37:28.320]  and feels amazing. And it's like, oh, yeah, it's, it's again, it's one, we should name one of those
[37:28.320 --> 37:32.800]  moments where you're like, this is the future. Um, this feels like the future. Uh, and then,
[37:32.800 --> 37:41.120]  and even to, you know, pile on that, uh, I had last week, I had made it up, uh, dinner,
[37:41.120 --> 37:48.240]  reservation using open table. Um, so I could meet somebody after work. And I get in the car
[37:48.240 --> 37:55.840]  and then open table gives me an alert on my wrist because I have a watch, uh, a watch app gives
[37:55.840 --> 38:00.880]  me alert on my wrist that I've got my, uh, dinner reservation in like, what, 10 minutes or something.
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.560]  And then I tap into the app on the wrist and go to the location and it opens up the map,
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.360]  starts giving me directions. Like, holy cow, I didn't expect for it to do that. I didn't ask for
[38:13.360 --> 38:20.480]  it to do that. But that's what the, that's what the watch does in 2015. Yeah, I, one of my first
[38:20.480 --> 38:26.720]  experiences like that was with, um, I think I, again, I want to repeat myself, but I think I
[38:26.720 --> 38:32.720]  said this to most, but it was on the Amtrak train and I had already saved the pass, uh, to my
[38:32.720 --> 38:39.920]  past book on the phone. And it just, when I got to Penn station, it just appeared on my watch.
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.320]  And then when we got in a train, it, the guy came by and I didn't have to fish anything out,
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.320]  didn't have to switch. I just held my wrist up to the guy and he scanned it and boom,
[38:48.320 --> 38:54.000]  we're on the train. It's awesome. I feel sync between the watch and the phone is just really
[38:54.000 --> 39:01.440]  highly tuned. Uh, I haven't felt it lacking in any way. Um, and, and that's kind of enjoyable to watch
[39:01.440 --> 39:09.440]  when you see different sync services, um, between your devices kind of fail at more points along the way.
[39:12.080 --> 39:20.160]  Do you think it was a mistake for Apple to already have apps? Like, I, it, and it's absolutely
[39:20.160 --> 39:27.040]  true in some cases where it, the basic thought when they, when they announced, um, the watch kit
[39:27.040 --> 39:30.960]  back in November and said, Hey, we're going to ship this in a couple of weeks,
[39:30.960 --> 39:35.680]  wait before the watch comes out. I just want to think, it sounds like a bad idea because you're
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.480]  asking people to, to write software, even if it's a limited SDK and it really is limited, but you're
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.640]  asking them to write software for a device that they've never used. And so they're not really
[39:44.640 --> 39:50.000]  know, they're, they're not really familiar with how they're supposed to use it. Um, and I think it's
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.960]  definitely true that some apps really, really suffer from that. Oh, absolutely. Um, yeah, I have a
[39:56.960 --> 40:01.840]  number of them on, on my watch that really suffered from that. Now, do you think, or do you know,
[40:02.640 --> 40:07.680]  anecdotally or otherwise, whether any developers were given early access to the watch specifically
[40:07.680 --> 40:16.000]  for making their apps better? Uh, I think you have to define layers of access. I don't think anybody
[40:16.000 --> 40:22.720]  got a watch. I think some people clearly got access. I mean, and obviously a lot of people got the
[40:22.720 --> 40:29.600]  developer lab invitations. And I think in the middle, there's, at each level, there's a smaller
[40:29.600 --> 40:35.760]  number of developers who got early access to I think to the labs. No, not, not that they got to take
[40:35.760 --> 40:41.440]  a watch and wear it, but that they got to, you know, fly out to Cupertino and, and write stuff.
[40:43.200 --> 40:48.240]  But on the other hand, I think, well, I just think that for example, though, I would assume Twitter
[40:48.240 --> 40:52.720]  is on that list of companies that had really privileged access. And I think that their app is
[40:52.720 --> 41:00.320]  useless almost. Oh, apps is, it's awful. Um, but on the, and then on the other hand, Marko's app is
[41:00.320 --> 41:06.960]  incredible. And yeah, I have no idea how he was, how he kind of figured out what user patterns
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.880]  would make the most sense without having the device and his have, except that, um, like I'm never
[41:12.880 --> 41:19.600]  wondering when I, from the very first time I launched Overcast on the watch, I never wondered how
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.960]  anything worked. It was, it was exactly what it was supposed to be. Yeah, I, I know he was worried
[41:24.960 --> 41:30.240]  about it. Remember, because I, I actually helped him beta test then before he shipped it, just
[41:30.240 --> 41:35.280]  so that he, you know, I had the review unit and, and I could, you know, do, it couldn't help much
[41:35.280 --> 41:40.000]  because he was getting ready to ship, but at least a little bit of sanity checking. Um, his big
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.360]  concern, well, uh, or one of his concerns was that there wouldn't be any point to it because
[41:45.360 --> 41:50.480]  there's that now plane widget, which can work with anything. And his, his thought was, well,
[41:50.480 --> 41:56.640]  what's the point of even doing it at all? If the now playing, um, handles everything. And I
[41:56.640 --> 42:01.760]  said, no, there's definitely usefulness in, even with just one day of testing Overcast on the watch,
[42:01.760 --> 42:05.840]  it was absolutely useful because, you know, there's no way with now playing to do anything
[42:05.840 --> 42:10.160]  really other than just playing pause, whereas Overcast on the watch, you can switch to a new podcast
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.880]  and stuff like that. Yeah. I mean, it's got context awareness. It knows what you're listening to,
[42:14.880 --> 42:21.680]  which is hugely important for a podcast library where people kind of listen to everything differently.
[42:22.400 --> 42:28.400]  Um, and that's pretty awesome. Um, and I, you know, the, the now playing app is there,
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.000]  but I don't know exactly what it does. And I don't know what it can, what it hijacks and what it
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.240]  doesn't hijack. And I'd rather just leave it, leave it alone. I wish there was, you know, it's just
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.280]  one of those Apple apps that you just kind of put in a drawer somewhere. Yeah, I kind of feel like
[42:41.280 --> 42:46.320]  as a pundit overall that it's, it's, and I, it's the sort of thing that I try to be cognizant of,
[42:46.320 --> 42:51.760]  but I know that I'm being guilty is it's like Apple can't win because if they didn't have any apps,
[42:51.760 --> 42:57.600]  I would be complaining that there should be apps already. And now that they shipped with apps on day
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.040]  one, I'm complaining because that's some of them don't work so well. And some of them don't
[43:03.040 --> 43:08.800]  seem to have been designed with the context, you know, in mind. Yeah, I can't wait till Slack's
[43:08.800 --> 43:14.720]  app gets good because I use Slack almost more than anything besides email. Um, and I, and I can't
[43:14.720 --> 43:21.280]  figure out how to actually respond to, to reply to us slack. And if you just open up slack,
[43:21.280 --> 43:28.880]  the Slack walk, watch app, you get, um, you're presented with two icons, one of which is, I think,
[43:28.880 --> 43:36.560]  direct messages and one of which is, is mentions of your name. Um, and neither one seems to be great
[43:36.560 --> 43:43.440]  at tracking like what conversations I actually need access to. And then if you get an alert in Slack,
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.400]  which I always do, there's no, all you can do it on the watch is dismiss it right away. You can
[43:48.400 --> 43:55.600]  actually reply from, from that, um, from that alert, which I want to do because that's, I mean,
[43:55.600 --> 44:01.760]  Slack is all about two eight communications, not broadcasting broadcast of a platform. Well, in the
[44:01.760 --> 44:09.280]  same way that you can respond to text messages, right? It's the fact that you can respond to text
[44:09.280 --> 44:14.000]  messages and dictate a little bit of the thing is what you would want to do with Slack. Absolutely.
[44:14.000 --> 44:19.680]  And that, which, which brings me to a point I was going to make, which is like, how forgiving we
[44:19.680 --> 44:27.040]  now can sort of let ourselves, let ourselves be of, like, of dictating, um, do you call it Siri?
[44:27.040 --> 44:33.280]  When, you know, I, I call it as, I just call it, yeah. So when you're dictating to Siri,
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.040]  even if it's like responding to a message, you know how like you can choose like a
[44:39.040 --> 44:44.880]  sent from iPhone signature with, with mail, with yeah, from, from mobile mail. And the idea behind
[44:44.880 --> 44:50.560]  that was, um, theoretically, it was probably just so that you could see like the other person
[44:50.560 --> 44:56.880]  receiving a cut you a little slack for reasons of brevity or typos or whatever. I feel like
[44:56.880 --> 45:02.320]  dictated by Siri kind of needs its own little say. And I, by the way, I sent, I turn sent from my
[45:02.320 --> 45:08.880]  iPhone off because I will like, I'll write a frickin novel in an email from my phone. It's just like
[45:08.880 --> 45:15.360]  one of my, I play my email on my phone like, like Beethoven. And I, and I take pride in that
[45:15.360 --> 45:21.840]  with italics and proper quote, quote levels and everything. And, um, so it would shame me to tell
[45:21.840 --> 45:26.080]  some, to tell somebody to try to make an excuse. You wouldn't want to. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't want
[45:26.080 --> 45:32.400]  to do that. But, but then again, um, if you're trying to, if you're trying to respond to a message,
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.480]  dictate it into your watch and then beat and then go on with your business, you're not going to
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.520]  sit there getting frustrated because she misheard something. And maybe it's clear enough, you know,
[45:41.520 --> 45:48.320]  maybe maybe it's, it's like enough to get the point. Uh, I've had a couple of misfires, um,
[45:48.320 --> 45:56.320]  with badly dictated messages to, you know, replies to text. Um, but that's just kind of fun. I,
[45:58.240 --> 46:05.760]  it's partly because it, there's like a tipping point I've realized where as, as Siri dictation
[46:05.760 --> 46:13.360]  has, has crossed some point on the curve between two, too slow and inaccurate to be useful. And
[46:13.360 --> 46:18.160]  it's reached a tipping point now where it's quick enough and accurate enough to be useful.
[46:18.720 --> 46:24.080]  Yeah. And I, you know, and it, this has happened for me in sometime in the last year. Um,
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.160]  you know, and I wrote a piece about it about how it was so much better on my iPhone a couple
[46:28.160 --> 46:35.280]  months ago, like I think a large part, them ramping this up for the watch. Um, but as it
[46:35.280 --> 46:40.240]  reaches that tipping point, suddenly you trusted a lot more. Whereas in the first couple of years
[46:40.240 --> 46:44.640]  where Siri existed and they had this dictation, I would double check every time before I'd hit
[46:44.640 --> 46:50.720]  send. And now I, a lot of times I, I'm hitting send without really looking at it. And sometimes
[46:50.720 --> 46:57.520]  they are, there's some pretty bad typos in there. Yeah. Um, I accidentally texted, uh, texted to
[46:57.520 --> 47:05.680]  Roxanna the other day. She said, Hey, can you stop by the store on the way home? Um, and I think I did,
[47:05.680 --> 47:11.920]  I responded, I dictated, um, do you want me to stop on the way home? Or do you want me to,
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.800]  want me to come home first? And then I, like I, I dictated that. And then I went on with what I was
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.920]  doing. What got sent was, do you want me to come home? Do you want me to stop on the way home?
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.840]  Or do you want me to come home first? I can't even know that. And she was like, what?
[47:27.840 --> 47:36.960]  Did you just say what's with the attitude? That does sound that's because it's like, it's like
[47:36.960 --> 47:42.560]  caddy, it's like kind of bitchy in the wrong way. Yeah. Usually if it's, if it's good, meaning like
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.920]  it's not, it's going to be obvious to your recipient, it's going to look like a homonym. You know,
[47:47.920 --> 47:51.840]  like if they read it out loud in their head, they'll, they'll take a guess. I actually kind of
[47:51.840 --> 47:57.360]  like that, like with Amy or other friends, you know, more technically inclined, you know, it's,
[47:57.360 --> 48:02.720]  let's face it, it's mostly who I'm texting. I like it when they can guess and they're like
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.840]  Siri or vice versa, I'll do it to them and try to guess whether the weird typo in the message
[48:07.840 --> 48:11.840]  they just sent me was because of that. Like I feel like it's becoming a skill. Whereas that I can't
[48:11.840 --> 48:16.640]  even hit the end doesn't sound like that. It sounds exactly like you're given our hard time.
[48:16.640 --> 48:20.720]  Yeah, it really does sound intentional. Like Siri just manufactured some attitude.
[48:21.440 --> 48:24.080]  I can't, I can't believe you would even ask me to do that.
[48:24.080 --> 48:30.480]  Um, what do you think of the fact that Siri doesn't talk back to you to watch?
[48:32.240 --> 48:38.560]  Oh, that's a good question. It somehow feels natural to me, although I do feel like a lot of
[48:38.560 --> 48:44.640]  her personality is missing because of that, but it somehow seems right to me. True, but maybe we,
[48:44.640 --> 48:50.880]  we like, we know that personality so well already that's ingrained that we can kind of hear her
[48:50.880 --> 48:55.760]  voice. Maybe like you did, it took me a couple of days to realize it. Oh, like she's not talking,
[48:55.760 --> 49:00.400]  there's not, she's not talking through the speaker when, when I ask her something. She's just like,
[49:00.400 --> 49:05.760]  it's just coming out in text, but I already can hear her. Yeah, I guess that's why I was a little
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.960]  slow to answer is because it would, the fact that she doesn't talk, uh, or depending on your country
[49:10.960 --> 49:18.320]  and your preferences, he doesn't talk, uh, uh, it, it sneaks up on you on the watch and you realize
[49:18.320 --> 49:22.880]  only after you've really been using Siri a lot that it, that it never talks to you.
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.520]  Right. I kind of like it. Yeah, it's, it's a little bit more private.
[49:29.520 --> 49:35.600]  Um, yeah, I, I had this thought that the watch is kind of maybe the watch is what cracks Siri
[49:35.600 --> 49:40.560]  open more than, much more than any other and anything else, like the watch is kind of one of the,
[49:40.560 --> 49:46.160]  of the, of the many things that the watch is watches like a Siri machine. Basically.
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.200]  Yeah, I think a large part of it. I think if you're not using Siri a couple of times a day,
[49:51.200 --> 49:55.120]  then you're not really getting the most out of the watch. Right. I really do think that's true.
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.520]  It's got a freaking microphone in it. It's, I think that's one thing that's a lot of people
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.240]  aren't really thinking about is you're wearing something on your, um, on your wrist that has a
[50:04.240 --> 50:10.960]  microphone in it that you can just talk to when it can record your thoughts, um, which makes it even
[50:10.960 --> 50:13.760]  more frustrating to me that there's not a voice recorder app on it.
[50:13.760 --> 50:18.160]  Yeah, that's a little weird. Well, let's hold that thought and let's talk about the apps that
[50:18.160 --> 50:24.160]  are missing. Um, but I, I want to do it our next sponsor and it is our friends at Hello,
[50:24.160 --> 50:34.720]  H U L L O. Hello, pillow. They make pillows. Um, really good. Um, I got the wrong notes
[50:34.720 --> 50:40.480]  in front of here. Hold on one sec. Here we go. Your favorite pillow guaranteed. Hello, pillow.com.
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.920]  Um, have you ever tried a buckwheat hole pillow? I had never even heard of a buckwheat hole
[50:45.920 --> 50:51.520]  pillow until Hello became a sponsor of the show. And then they send me one and it came in a box
[50:51.520 --> 50:55.680]  and it was so heavy. Actually, they sent me two and it was such a heavy box. I could not believe
[50:55.680 --> 50:59.920]  that it was a pillow because pillow to me seems like something that's supposed to be light and fluffy
[50:59.920 --> 51:06.000]  and you take it out. Um, and this is a thing that people have been using to make pillows for
[51:06.000 --> 51:10.640]  hundreds of years in Asia, buckwheat pillows. They're, they're almost like they're filled with like
[51:10.640 --> 51:17.440]  seeds or something like that. Uh, really, really, uh, different than like a fluffy feather pillow type
[51:17.440 --> 51:22.640]  thing. Totally did not buy it at first. And then I tried sleeping on it and it was great. Uh,
[51:22.640 --> 51:28.880]  so part of the advantage is to having a pillow filled with these buckwheat holes is that air
[51:28.880 --> 51:34.160]  flows through them. And so I've had this, I first got this back in December. So I've
[51:34.160 --> 51:38.240]  slept on it in the winter and now it's getting warm. It's in the 80s here today in Philadelphia.
[51:38.240 --> 51:43.040]  I've slept on it in a warm weather. So whether your house is a little warmer or a little cold,
[51:43.040 --> 51:47.040]  the air flows through it and your head doesn't just kind of get stuck and sweaty on the pillow.
[51:47.040 --> 51:52.240]  Uh, you can adjust the thickness to your personal preference just by removing the holes anytime
[51:52.240 --> 51:58.320]  you just unzip it, open it up, take some of them out. It is made in the USA with high quality
[51:58.320 --> 52:03.760]  construction and materials, really nice materials, really good zipper. Everything feels super premium.
[52:03.760 --> 52:08.640]  Um, and they only use, they even go through great, you can go to their website and, um,
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.160]  is that here? What is that? What are you doing here? I hear like a vacuum cleaner or something.
[52:18.160 --> 52:21.760]  No, that's you. There's an airplane over here.
[52:24.400 --> 52:28.960]  All right, I'll just make a note at the time. Uh, I don't know what I don't know what she's doing
[52:28.960 --> 52:36.720]  downstairs. Crazy. What is it? 53 minutes. I think if I told her to do,
[52:37.600 --> 52:41.040]  I think she's like grinding something. I don't know, like, uh, it's doing something in the kitchen.
[52:41.040 --> 52:45.760]  Anyway, uh, you guys go to their website and you can even see the extraordinary lengths these
[52:45.760 --> 52:52.320]  go to to get high quality, uh, buckwheat holes. They, they, they're hand grown and milled in North
[52:52.320 --> 52:57.840]  Dakota. Uh, they've searched the world just to get like the best ones that they can. Um,
[52:57.840 --> 53:03.440]  the, everything, even the zipper is nice. It's an environmentally friendly organic product,
[53:03.440 --> 53:07.760]  no chemical based phones, no bird feathers, anything like that. Really, really good. Probably for
[53:07.760 --> 53:12.960]  people with allergies. Uh, even the cotton they use on the outside of the pillow is 100%
[53:13.200 --> 53:19.200]  unbleached certified organic cotton. So here's the thing. It's just like a lot of these products,
[53:19.200 --> 53:22.880]  where it's like, hmm, I don't know if I want to try it below that I've only bought online because
[53:22.880 --> 53:29.840]  somebody told me about it on a podcast. Um, they have a 60 night full guarantee refund. So get
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.280]  it. Try it. Start sleeping on it. Give it two months. And if you don't like it, just put it back
[53:35.280 --> 53:41.440]  in the box and they will send you a refund. No questions asked. No hassle. Uh, that's how sure
[53:41.440 --> 53:45.760]  they are that you're going to like it. They have three different sizes. Go there, read, uh, tells
[53:45.760 --> 53:53.680]  you all about them. Uh, really, really good prices. Uh, you can save 20% on each additional, uh,
[53:53.680 --> 54:01.520]  that you buy. And the URL that you want to use is hello pillow H, you L, L, L, L, O, W,
[54:01.600 --> 54:08.720]  dot com slash talk show, hello pillow, uh, dot com slash talk show. So my thanks to them.
[54:10.480 --> 54:12.400]  I love buying crazy stuff like that on the internet.
[54:12.400 --> 54:19.040]  Just trying it out. Yeah. I'm telling you, we've been getting it around and get all this free stuff.
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.280]  So yeah, but I wouldn't still have it, you know, we still have both of them on the bed. It's,
[54:23.280 --> 54:29.200]  it's a great poem. Great. Welcome. Daring Fireballers. That's what you see when you go there.
[54:29.200 --> 54:34.800]  So what were we talking about with the, uh, no voice recorder app was the thing I said. Yeah.
[54:34.800 --> 54:42.320]  And there's no notes app. Um, no voice recorder app. Uh, like, yeah. So like, yeah,
[54:42.320 --> 54:45.760]  I mean, you don't even need both of those. You just need one or the other, because you could,
[54:46.400 --> 54:51.360]  I feel, I don't know. That's not true. Uh, I know what you mean. No, because the whole idea is you
[54:51.360 --> 54:55.600]  just have a thought in your head. You want to commit to the watch. And if you get dictaphone,
[54:55.600 --> 55:02.880]  you want to put it down. Yeah. So why not? Like, I do that all the time. Do you do it? I, I do, um,
[55:02.880 --> 55:07.280]  my number one use case for voice recorder app on the phone is when I've been working with a
[55:07.280 --> 55:12.880]  composer. And I don't like having, uh, you know, I need to like, I'll often like sing a thing. If
[55:12.880 --> 55:18.000]  I'm trying to express it and can't put it in words, I'll, I'll sing a thing. And then I'll, um,
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.120]  send it off as an audio thing, or maybe sometimes we record temp voice over with the voice
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.880]  over app. Um, and every once in a while, I guess I'm driving and I have a thought and I want to, um,
[55:28.880 --> 55:34.400]  I don't want to record it. So I don't forget it. Then that's the third use case. But to me,
[55:34.400 --> 55:39.360]  the fact that there's, there's nothing like that on the watch is, is uncomfortable, unconscionable.
[55:39.360 --> 55:42.880]  Yeah. The closest thing I could think of would be like, at least with the built in apps,
[55:43.760 --> 55:50.000]  would be like texting yourself. I guess so. But even then, that seems, it just seems a little weird.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  Um, and there are definitely third party apps ever note has a pretty decent app. Um,
[55:56.000 --> 56:04.240]  um, uh, I forget what else I've tried. Um, you know, and it seems like it's fairly focused on,
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.400]  uh, the watch specific thing. I think if, if, if, if, and when the day comes that there's a
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.440]  Vesper thing for the phone, it really just be a big plus button and make a new note. And that's,
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.520]  just hit plus, start talking. There's the text and then you've done because it's really all I
[56:21.520 --> 56:26.960]  really want. Sounds great. I wonder if you could see used Siri and just say, Hey, Siri, make a new
[56:26.960 --> 56:32.480]  note. I wonder what she would do. Um, yeah, I don't know. Does she know how to work with reminders
[56:32.480 --> 56:38.640]  that, or, uh, or any notes app? It still confuses me what Siri works with and what she doesn't work
[56:38.640 --> 56:42.560]  with. Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't think that would work on the watch, although I'm not sure what
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.640]  happens versus the phone. You know, it's a funny thing when you're on a podcast. If you use that,
[56:46.640 --> 56:52.880]  that phrase, Hey, and in the name of the product, it, it will end up getting notes from people
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.120]  whose devices while they were listening to the show started going. I'm not saying we can't say it
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.160]  because it's hard to talk about it without saying a Siri, but it turns out that it turns out that
[57:02.160 --> 57:05.680]  people who like listen, obviously, if you're listening with headphones on, but just probably
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.280]  how most people listen to podcasts nowadays, it doesn't. But if, you know, a lot of a lot of people
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.440]  like, uh, my pal Brent Simmons, he just likes to listen to podcasts on the speakers at his desk,
[57:13.440 --> 57:17.360]  while he works, you know, it's like he said, like, I haven't talked, you know, the way, you know,
[57:17.360 --> 57:20.720]  other people like to have talk radio on, he just likes to have podcasts. It makes it sound like
[57:20.720 --> 57:24.720]  it's in a, you know, office full of friends or whatever, but then it makes like your charging
[57:24.720 --> 57:31.440]  iPhone at your desk like wake up. That's awesome. So I mean, that's dangerous also. Once,
[57:32.160 --> 57:39.280]  once Siri becomes more, you know, more, more aware of like operating the insides of a phone
[57:39.280 --> 57:44.800]  rather than just referring to the outsides. Well, if you, and it puts great power in front of us,
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.920]  because we could do something like, say the phrase that would initiate that and then immediately
[57:49.920 --> 57:56.800]  say, text my wife, I'm leaving you sent. Well, that's dark. I was just thinking like, hey,
[57:56.800 --> 58:14.080]  Siri, make a fart. So what are your favorite apps? I totally love the weather app. I think
[58:14.080 --> 58:17.360]  that the weather app has one. It took me a while to get used to it. And this is one of those
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.240]  apps. This is the built in weather app from Apple. And it's one of those apps where it's to me
[58:22.240 --> 58:27.280]  surprisingly deep, because it starts with all of the cities you've configured on your iPhone
[58:27.280 --> 58:33.680]  weather app. So it already knows the cities that you're interested in. And you can scroll
[58:33.680 --> 58:40.000]  down to get details and you get like a 10 day forecast and all this stuff. You go side to side
[58:40.000 --> 58:46.400]  to switch cities and locations. But then while you're on a city, you can tap it and it changes from
[58:46.400 --> 58:50.880]  like the next, like a clock style. It's, you know, and to me, that's optimized for the watch.
[58:50.880 --> 59:00.160]  It's like the next 10 hours of like precipitation, the cloud cover and the temperature. My only
[59:00.160 --> 59:05.760]  complaint is I kind of wish that they combined the cloud cover and temperature ones because I want
[59:05.760 --> 59:09.440]  the temperature and the, you know, whether or not it's like likely to rain.
[59:12.080 --> 59:17.120]  You pay attention to the weather a lot. I guess you would have to. Yeah, yeah, we don't live in
[59:17.120 --> 59:22.400]  Southern California. I don't, I never, ever open a weather app, but I'm just, I'm looking through it
[59:22.400 --> 59:27.760]  as you're talking. And yeah, it is really nicely done. Yeah, well, and, you know, April, April's
[59:27.760 --> 59:31.360]  probably a good time to have been trying it because April is the type of month where the weather is
[59:31.360 --> 59:37.680]  you have no idea, you know, and, and just because it's really cold in the morning when you wake up,
[59:37.680 --> 59:42.080]  it might go up to 70 in the afternoon and you want to see that. So it's like just knowing like
[59:42.080 --> 59:46.480]  looking at the temperature right now at 10 in the morning doesn't necessarily give you a clue as
[59:46.480 --> 59:51.440]  to what it's going to be like an afternoon. So I think the weather app was probably when I first
[59:51.440 --> 59:57.440]  put on the watch and, um, and it's loading the cities and I saw the status spinner. I think that's
[59:57.440 --> 1:00:03.040]  probably the first time I saw like, oh, an app taped takes time. It's not, it's not instantaneous
[1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:08.400]  like on your iPhone. Yeah, but sometimes it doesn't. I still can't quite figure out why sometimes it
[1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:13.600]  takes longer than others. And maybe it's because I'm not quite sure how much of it is to blame on
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:22.000]  Bluetooth and how much of it is like that the phone is checking the weather in advance already and
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.920]  already has up to date weather information. And then other times maybe the watch is like, you know,
[1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:31.760]  hey, phone, tell me about the weather. This guy wants to see the weather and the phone is like,
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:36.400]  oh shit, I haven't checked in a while. You got to wait. Hold on. And yeah, you know, it makes sense
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:43.600]  that they get smarter about caching that stuff and smarter about just collecting the data when
[1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:48.880]  you need it and maybe collecting a little too much. And maybe that's kind of like the, you know,
[1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:55.360]  how like scrolling on the iPhone one wasn't quite as as glassy as it is now. Maybe that's a kind
[1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:04.320]  of a sort of an analog to like waiting for data to load on the watch. Yeah. What about you? What are
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:11.680]  your favorite apps? Well, yeah, like I said, overcast is probably, I use it a lot. Remote is really
[1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:17.280]  cool. Yep. Then again, I've always been a, I've always liked the remote app on the iPhone and it was
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:22.640]  I never did before when people would complain endlessly about it. Yeah, it takes forever to connect.
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:28.960]  But I think it's probably, I'm still one of those people that's just kind of still impressed
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:34.240]  by the fact that I can control my something on my TV with my phone. And it just it never doesn't
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:42.480]  amaze me. And so now the fact that I can do that a little bit quicker and the pairing like sort
[1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:50.000]  of seems to last longer, I think, you know, before getting dumped and I have to then reconnect.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:56.640]  I just think it's, it's pretty cool. I've, I find that I have always, I mean, I just lose
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:02.320]  the stupid Apple TV remote. I lose it 10 times every time I watch a movie. I mean, not in lose
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:07.840]  it, meaning like like is it on my left hand side of the couch right hand side 15 minutes. And
[1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:13.360]  all I wanted to do was quick pause because, you know, Amy's asking me a question from upstairs
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:18.320]  during the kitchen or something. And I just just want to pause the damn thing. I really like
[1:02:18.320 --> 1:02:22.880]  having it on the wrist. And it's one of those little things where I feel like you kind of have to take
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:28.720]  what people that Apple say at their word. Like when Tim Cook has said what he likes about wearing
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:32.720]  the Apple watch and he's, you know, I've heard him say it like three or four times that he likes
[1:02:32.720 --> 1:02:38.400]  using it as a remote control to control his Apple TV. And as somebody who never liked the one on the
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:43.280]  phone, because I always found then it's like it's even worse because it's a device that's just
[1:02:43.280 --> 1:02:47.920]  a small and I can, you know, lose it between seat cushions. But then, you know, what are the odds
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:53.280]  that the current app is the Apple is the remote app. It's not because I'm probably texting people or
[1:02:53.280 --> 1:02:57.520]  checking Twitter because I'm doing two things at once. And then I've got a double tap to switch.
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:02.640]  But the way that the thing works on the watch is if you're watching something actively watching it,
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:07.680]  it just automatically goes back to being the remote, not the clock face or anything like that.
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:11.040]  Which to me is exactly what I want. It's as though the device read my mind.
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:20.560]  Totally. It's good for that. A little tip. We taped the remote, sorry, the Apple TV remote in our
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:27.680]  bedroom. We taped it to like a little packet of Kleenex. So that's a life hack.
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:34.960]  But we, you know, the kids in bed with us playing with it and he'll drop it down between the
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:41.520]  mattress and the bed frame quicker than anything. But yeah, so that's, that's a fun one.
[1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:48.880]  Other than that, I think activity tracker is really cool. Heart rate monitor is really cool.
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:58.720]  I like the fact that, so we worked with a job on up as a client. We did something with Fitbit.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.080]  So I've had the experience of wearing these activity trackers. But honestly, it just always
[1:04:06.080 --> 1:04:12.720]  felt too cumbersome for me to like keep something like with me all the time that was dedicated to
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.760]  that purpose. If I'm not going to wear a watch, then I don't really want to wear a wristband that
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:23.680]  only does that one thing. But now that I've got everything in that thing and the fact that it's an
[1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:31.040]  activity tracker, now I'm finally getting the value of an activity tracker. And so just earlier
[1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:36.400]  today, if I can either take the elevator up to my office or take the stairs. And I know that this
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:43.200]  stupid thing is going to remind me that, you know, like I have like 100 more calories to burn
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:50.640]  or something, then I'm give, I don't know why. I'm, I guess I don't have as much free agency as
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:55.680]  I think I do. But I'm going to take the stairs because I'm a child and I want a little, I want a
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:01.600]  little trophy. I thought it was silly when I saw people say that it had, somebody had a report,
[1:05:01.600 --> 1:05:06.720]  it might have been a wired magazine story, like behind the scenes of the creation of the watch,
[1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:11.680]  probably was because that guy had the most access and that it, it's become common within an
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:18.160]  Apple, like in the middle of a meeting for people to just stand up randomly. Because a watch that
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:23.760]  they're wearing said, hey, you know, there's like your last chance to get another hour where you've
[1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:30.960]  stood for a minute. And it's just like become part of the, and again, it's like you can, and within
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:34.640]  Apple, I'm sure that people would just chuckle because they know why you're doing it. And maybe you
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:39.840]  wouldn't do it if you were in a meeting with people from another company, you know, who aren't familiar
[1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:45.200]  but that within the walls of Apple, this great seemingly crazy behavior has become a norm that
[1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.280]  you can just stand up for a minute and kind of, you know, move your legs in the middle of a meeting
[1:05:50.240 --> 1:05:55.200]  because you want to make your watch happy. And I have to admit, I expected to turn that off and I
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:06:01.520]  still have it on. Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of fun. It's task completion. And I, you got to
[1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:07.520]  think that an app is coming. It's more like a game, almost like yo level of stupid simplicity
[1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:14.000]  where like it just reminds, it sends you a reminder to like pump your fist. And you have to pump,
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.480]  you have to, you have to like pump your fist. No matter where you are. And if you do it quicker,
[1:06:18.480 --> 1:06:22.640]  you get more points or something. And then just idiots are going to be pumping their fists all over
[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:30.640]  the place. I think that they did a really interesting amount of design on those activity,
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:40.160]  like summaries and the stand reminders in terms of getting the balance right so that you keep
[1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:47.200]  using it. And that it changes your behavior, which is the goal. But combine that with like,
[1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:52.960]  obviously the team that made the watch has been, you know, using it in some degree internally for
[1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:58.720]  a while, right? Like a year, maybe longer, you know, testing these prototypes, probably longer than that
[1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:02.240]  that, you know, the people in the design lab have been wearing the early prototypes to try to
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:06.640]  fine tune the software. And I feel like once they got into it for a very long time, it would be
[1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:11.600]  easy to lose track of I think this is how a lot of first run experiences go wrong is that the team
[1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:16.800]  that makes it gets into it and gets it and understands it and loses track of what it would be
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:21.680]  like to have an on your wrist for the first day. And then you feel like my god, this thing will
[1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:28.000]  not shut up about me standing. And I feel like they dialed it back to a level where it's,
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:35.200]  it's really well balanced between those two in terms of being frequent enough to get you to change,
[1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:40.160]  you know, some of your behavior, but not so frequent that you feel like, you know, why in a world
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:46.160]  would this thing be bugging me like this? Totally. If you just, I think that's the case is if you
[1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:51.040]  ignore it, then it knows you're ignoring it. And instead of maybe instead of shutting itself off
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:57.440]  completely, it just gives you less frequent alerts. And so it's kind of like on boards you,
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:03.600]  and then instead of you saying, this sucks, I'm jumping off, it does just very smart little things
[1:08:03.600 --> 1:08:09.680]  to keep you on. And that's exactly what happened with me is is like first I found it cool,
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:13.920]  then I found it annoying, then I actually gave in and wanted to do what it told me.
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:21.200]  Yeah. I, and it has been a little bit of an eye opener for me. I've never worn any of those
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:28.320]  trackers. It's been a little bit of an eye opener for me. Like that there's definitely some
[1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:34.960]  shockingly a correlation between a very productive day as a blogger and a very sedentary day.
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:44.080]  Like the day that I wrapped up the second sort of Apple watch review that I published like a week
[1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:50.160]  ago, it was like my circles went nowhere. Like it was like, it was like, I finally got like on a
[1:08:50.160 --> 1:08:55.360]  chain, like I finally got on a groove and I was in his own. And I felt like I had this article I'd
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:59.120]  been trying to get out for a long time off. And then it's like, when I finished it, I looked down and
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.040]  it looked like, it looked like my watch usually doesn't like, well, you know, two and an afternoon.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.800]  You should win an award for that. There should be like anti you know how they give you the,
[1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:13.520]  have you gotten some of those awards? They give you like these. Yeah, I just got like this silver
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:19.120]  concentric circles one. Yeah, they should give you like a booby booby award, you know, for
[1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:27.920]  all you've really screwed up. Yeah. Because it ended nothing. Right. And the thing is one of the
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:33.120]  things that's so interesting about this watch is, um, and I feel like it's one of the things that we
[1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.880]  just, the first version of it, the one that you and I are talking about right now just has not
[1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:43.440]  even tapped into it. But the watch knows when you're wearing, right? It's as soon as you take it off,
[1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:47.280]  like to show somebody or to change the band or whatever, it knows it's off your wrist because the
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:54.960]  sensors are off and it locks the screen and, um, but that means that like, if you are not going
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:59.360]  to wear it all the time, if you're going to wear it like you're, you know, dress watch when you go
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:02.800]  out at night or something like that, you're going to wear it sometimes. The watch knows when
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:06.720]  you're not being active because you're not wearing it and there also knows when you're not
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:10.080]  being active, even though you are wearing it, which is a big difference, right? Like if I just
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:14.480]  decide to wear my old watch for another day and I don't put the Apple watch on for a day,
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:18.960]  I'm not going to register any activity on the watch, but the watch also knows that I haven't been
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:25.440]  like a complete turd. Sure. Whereas if you are, if you're wearing it, I think that's so interesting.
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:29.520]  And I, I feel like it could really come into play in a lot of different ways.
[1:10:30.240 --> 1:10:33.920]  That, that, that's true, but it, but it also entices you to keep wearing it.
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:37.520]  Yeah, until the moment you shut your eyes to go to sleep, right?
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.600]  Yeah, I totally underestimated that. And, you know, before I started wearing it is how much
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.560]  those fitness tracking things, even as somebody who's not super into that, those features,
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:52.720]  but they still motivate me to keep wearing it and not wear my, my other watches because I want
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:59.840]  to get the credits. Yeah, I, um, I went for a run the other night and, uh, turned on me like
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.080]  what is, it's not, it's the, it's the exercise app. It's not the activity tracker workout.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.960]  I, yeah, the workout act app and I told it I was going for an outdoor run and I went,
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:16.960]  uh, I was running. I ran for 24 minutes. I got home. It told me you should probably run for
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:23.600]  30 minutes. I went back out and ran for another six minutes. I came back in. Uh, I came back
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:28.240]  in the house. I took the watch off, but it was still going because it was like, I, I didn't set
[1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:34.080]  it goal. I had just left, left it as an open exercise. And, uh, I took off the watch and then like
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:39.520]  the bottom of the watch was glowing green and it frightened me. I didn't know why. And then I just,
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:44.720]  like I researched it a little bit and found out that the green light is how it actually reads your
[1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:50.560]  heart rate. Do, do you know about that? Yes, a little bit. And I think it switches to a more powerful
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:55.680]  mode when you're in midst of a workout like probably, you know, and it's, it's like, um, uh, it,
[1:11:55.680 --> 1:12:00.960]  it pulls your heartbeat constantly as opposed to doing it every, you know, six, seven minutes.
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:05.280]  Right. Which is weird to me because like if you, if you, uh, you know, you, an iron ball
[1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:10.640]  sitting, presumably, if you go over to the heart rate monitor in, in your glances or whatever,
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:15.840]  then it's going to tell you like your heart rate was whatever three minutes ago. But now it's
[1:12:15.840 --> 1:12:19.920]  reading, it's, it's taking a new reading. And that's, that's weird to me when I saw that the first
[1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:24.640]  time that three minutes ago, it was like, it was paying attention to my heart rate. I didn't tell
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:28.960]  it to do that, but I think it's kind of awesome that it did. And so presumably there's like, I've got
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:34.560]  a whole day's worth of data. And if I were going through like medical stuff, that would be kind
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:39.840]  of interesting to my doctor, I would think. Yeah. Yeah. 69 beats per minute a minute ago.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.440]  But now it just took it again. It says I'm at 83. So I don't know. You got me,
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:48.080]  got me excited. I think I get nervous. I think I get nervous when I look at it and it makes my heart
[1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:53.600]  rate go up. But it was 60. I was, I don't even want to say what, I was 95.
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:59.360]  Because I guess like, yeah, that's why I'm because I'm excited. Yeah. I had a big lunch.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.760]  I think the workout app is an interesting app too. I like it. And I like the way that it is like
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:15.760]  just brain dead super simple. Here's some big buttons for different types of workouts.
[1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:24.320]  Go pick the one that you're going to start right now, tap the button and hit go. Yeah. Although
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:28.240]  I wasn't sure, I wasn't sure what to do when I go for a run, whether I should tell it how far I
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:33.040]  want to go or how long I want to go. Yeah. I think like the last, well, I didn't do either.
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:39.200]  The last item on the list was just open. And it just measure how much I'm doing. And then
[1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:45.680]  that we'll call it done. Yeah. I think there's an interesting combination here. And again,
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:49.360]  I haven't used a Fitbit or any of those things. But I feel like one of the problems that never
[1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:53.120]  made me want to use one is that they didn't really show you anything. You just, you know,
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:56.880]  at least the one that like Amy has doesn't really have much of a display. It just, I don't know,
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:01.440]  like four bars that light up. And then you have to plug it in your computer or sync it with the
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:07.520]  iPhone app and then use a different device to check what it thinks you did. Whereas I feel like a lot of,
[1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:14.720]  a lot of things with the phone, to me, are the key to their success is that the phone is both
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:21.120]  both sides of the equation. And two examples are Instagram and like Periscope and Miracat,
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:27.120]  where it's the same device that people are using to shoot the photos and edit the photos and post
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:33.680]  the photos is the same device that everyone else is using to see the photos. And I feel like
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:37.760]  that's the way that the fitness tracking stuff on the watch to me works. And I know it doesn't have
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:42.320]  like everything. Like it's, it's, it's interesting where they cut it off. Like I think it shows you
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:46.080]  like your last workout, but it doesn't show you your whole workout history. You have to go to the
[1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:50.240]  phone app to see your workout history. But that's because the history is too much information for the
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:56.000]  watch. It's just enough. But it's like, here's what I think you did today. Yeah. And I think that
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:15:02.880]  that kind of just speaks to the whole purpose of the watch in general is just enough. And not too much
[1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  because too much is just going to be, is going to make people, it's going to turn people off to it.
[1:15:10.400 --> 1:15:16.000]  And I've noticed that just with like the notifications, do you use the Gmail app at all?
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:20.160]  No, I do not use Apple Mail. I just use Apple Mail. So Apple Mail,
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:29.280]  well, so, so sandwiches email is all run through Google. And Google, like, you don't get Google
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:37.520]  push email working very well through Apple Mail. So I, so what I do is I use, I use the Gmail app
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:43.920]  on my phone to write away, push me an alert, you know, notification that I have an email. And then
[1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:49.680]  when I get that alert, I know to go into my Apple Mail app and it'll go and fetch that email.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:54.720]  It's kind of around about way of being obsessive about email, but it works for me.
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:16:01.440]  So I use Gmail is basically like an alert. And so I've got Gmail alerts on my watch. And what
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:06.080]  Gmail does when it notifies you of a new email on your watch is it only gives you a few lines
[1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:12.240]  of preview of the of the message. Whereas Apple Mail, when it tells you there's a new email,
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:17.360]  you can actually scroll through the whole email. But the weird psychological effect of that
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:24.320]  is because I'm obsessive about email, if Gmail tells me about I've got a new email and I can see
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:28.960]  only the first few lines, then I know I can then kind of save it for later and then go back
[1:16:29.760 --> 1:16:34.800]  when I have time and go into my mail program. And then I know I can respond to it then.
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:40.960]  But if it shows me the whole thing, I think that I have to respond to it right then. So that's
[1:16:40.960 --> 1:16:47.200]  another instance of just just enough, just enough info to like note to do something later with it.
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:56.000]  And this is kind of like that time, you know, reevaluating your time that people were talking
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:03.200]  about early on, that the watch kind of affords you is like the opportunity to take your iPhone
[1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:09.600]  out less and less. Yeah. And I know I've gone back and forth. That's one of those things where I'm
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:15.040]  so I feel like it's just unlucky that I've had the the watch as long as I have because, and to me,
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:23.120]  and it's like my opinion has changed on it where at first, I thought that it was that this whole
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.840]  argument that it's about taking your phone out less. I was like, I'm not taking my phone out any less.
[1:17:29.360 --> 1:17:34.240]  I didn't think I was, but then I thought about it and I realized I kind of was. It's like,
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:38.800]  and to me, the difference is do I want to do something? If I want to do something, I still go to the
[1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:45.840]  phone, but it's, it's like, do I just want to check what do I want to check something then I can just
[1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:49.680]  look at the watch? And I don't know, there's like a subtle difference there. And I'm sure, you know,
[1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:54.880]  there's all sorts of things that are sort of gray areas where one, but if I'm just checking something,
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:18:00.720]  it's, it's, I'm using the watch and I'm not taking the phone out. So I am taking the phone out,
[1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:05.520]  but I'm not using it less. Like if it's something I really want to do, I'm still going to do it
[1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:10.960]  on the, on the phone. Yeah, and you want to do stuff. So I mean, I even want to do more stuff with
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:16.240]  the watch. That's one of the first thing I need for things I noticed is that because we're trained
[1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:20.640]  to do that, like you, you, you check something and then you do something about it right away.
[1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:26.880]  It feels unnatural to check something, have it appear on the watch and not do something about it
[1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:32.400]  right away. So you have to kind of get used to that, or at least I did. And it makes me want to be
[1:18:32.400 --> 1:18:42.320]  able to do more with the watch, but I'm okay that I can't, I guess. But yeah, that's the end of that
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:48.640]  thought. Well, but I feel like email is almost like ground zero for that line of thinking because,
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:52.480]  and this is the thing that I thought boy, that sounds really weird, but now that I've had the watch
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:59.680]  a month, it kind of makes sense is that the watch has your email, you know, from the mail dot app
[1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:05.280]  and on the thing, but you can't write. So you don't get to respond and you don't get to
[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:11.360]  craft a new message. It's really just read only. And it's, and I've been using email forever
[1:19:11.920 --> 1:19:16.640]  on all sorts of everything from, you know, terminals to, you know, dial up modems. And
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:22.880]  I've never heard of a read only email client before. And it just didn't make any sense to me,
[1:19:22.880 --> 1:19:27.120]  even though I don't write that much email anymore compared, you know, with Slack and
[1:19:27.120 --> 1:19:33.760]  instant messaging picking up a lot of the smaller messages. It just didn't make sense to me,
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:37.440]  but I kind of think it is because I think it's exactly that use case where you said where it's
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:42.560]  really, even though you can read the whole message on the watch, just in case maybe it is important,
[1:19:42.560 --> 1:19:47.680]  it's really just about those first few lines. Like is this something you want to go deal with
[1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:54.800]  right now? Yeah. And I do things, I do think there's an anxiety reduction in that.
[1:19:54.800 --> 1:19:59.920]  Absolutely. It's you're exactly right. It's anxiety reducing because what's the alternative?
[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:05.040]  You get a notification or you get a buzz in your pocket while you're having a conversation with
[1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:10.800]  somebody. It's rude to check the notification. So then you have the anxiety of not knowing what it is.
[1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:17.440]  So I think that's that's it. That sums it up right there. And an instant is just suddenly
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:24.720]  just from the ability to turn your wrist, you know, 40 degrees up towards you and glance
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:29.520]  down at it. You know that you don't have to pay attention to it. And you go about you go on with
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:34.880]  the rest of your conversation. Do you know who has a really cool app for? And part of it is for
[1:20:34.880 --> 1:20:38.240]  the phone, but I feel like the iPhone app is actually pretty good is the New York Times.
[1:20:39.440 --> 1:20:43.920]  And I never had the New York Times thing on my phone. I do read the New York Times on the web a lot,
[1:20:43.920 --> 1:20:50.000]  and I but I never really used their apps. But I wanted to test their watch app and they had
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:55.120]  won, they had one of the apps that came out like way, you know, really early, like the day after
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:20:59.760]  I got the review unit. So it was like really, there weren't that many third party apps in the
[1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:06.000]  app story to try. So I wanted to try it. And the reason why is that they, unlike every other news
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:12.320]  organization, I've ever granted temporary permission to send me notifications for they really do
[1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:17.840]  only send you notifications for important news. Like so days will go by and they don't send you
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:24.640]  any notifications because nothing really happened. But then, you know, like, you know, like the
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.400]  earthquake, when the earthquake hit over in Nepal, then it's like, well, that's something I,
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:32.720]  you know, that was, that was actually worth you tapping me on the wrist to tell me that it happened.
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:38.560]  And I, you know, I don't know where I was going with that.
[1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:44.480]  Well, no, I mean, just once again, it's just enough. It's just the important stuff. It doesn't
[1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:53.360]  need to ping you every time, you know, whatever. It says, I don't, like I have the breaking
[1:21:53.360 --> 1:22:01.840]  news app on my phone. I have on circa. And, uh, you can like scroll through the top five stories
[1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:08.960]  and, uh, and then you're good. And if you want to go any deeper, but like, so here's another question,
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:15.360]  do you find yourself like lying awake at night? Like in bed, you've got your watch on,
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:22.480]  you want to like consume more content through the watch other than because it's a new toy and
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:27.440]  you want to play with it. Only only in the first few days when I had it and that that has totally
[1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:31.360]  worn off, like I don't want to consume any content on the watch. Another example,
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:37.360]  it's very common for me. I mean, I'm guessing it's probably common for everybody who
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:44.000]  listens to podcasts. This is the whole reason. I think people like podcasts is that we, as a,
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:50.400]  you know, the type of people that you and I are, we just cannot bear to be bored at all for like
[1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:56.480]  for 15 seconds. I cannot, you know, and again, it's, you know, Louisa K has the entire bits about,
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:01.120]  you know, how that just shows up what's wrong with us. But like, if I'm in a store and there's two
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:05.760]  people ahead of me at the register, I've taken out my phone, I'm going to read Twitter or something
[1:23:05.760 --> 1:23:12.000]  because God forbid I don't have something to occupy my mind for the next 45 seconds. It never
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:18.480]  tempts me to go to the watch. Like, because the watch isn't a do something, don't bore me, you know,
[1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:24.960]  like again, if I'm taking action, I want to go find something not to be bored by. I'd still go to
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:28.960]  the phone. I think to go to the phone, like the watches for things that you don't even have to think
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:34.160]  about. You know what I mean? I don't know. There's like a certain, and again, you know, Apple's
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:40.240]  using the word. It's an official name of the featured glances. But I think it's brilliantly chosen
[1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:46.880]  word. What glances do you have? You know, that's a good question. I feel like I have been thinking
[1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:51.200]  about it. Like I've been waiting for my, the other watch I ordered to come. And I was thinking that I
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:56.480]  would set it up differently and probably have a lot fewer glances. I seem to have a lot. And I kind
[1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:01.360]  of feel like glances are like, you really should just make them your favorites. And then that's
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:05.040]  like the quickest way to get to those things that you do because then you don't have to go to
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:08.800]  that home screen where there's these tiny little buttons. You just swipe up and swipe over and
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:14.720]  there's your glance. Yeah. I mean, when I first saw the idea of glances, I thought that it was
[1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:20.320]  supposed to, you're supposed to consider it like your doc or something. Yeah. Those are your shortcuts.
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:26.160]  But I think that's not what they intended it for it to be because theoretically, you can access
[1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:31.840]  any of your apps pretty easily anyway. You don't need a shortcut. I think it's just for like the
[1:24:31.840 --> 1:24:37.840]  little bits of information that you want accessible to you very quickly without having to launch
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:42.960]  the app. That's what I think. But I don't have too many of those things. I mean, like power,
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:49.680]  you know, battery power is one of them. What do I have? Yeah. But I find with the battery
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:53.040]  power. Now, maybe it's different for you. And that I would be interested to hear that. Like
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:25:00.480]  right now, mine is at 76%. So and we're recording at it's nine o'clock Eastern. So I mean, it's
[1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:08.240]  I've mostly through the day. Oh, that's pretty good. Yeah. Mine's at 59. But I pretty much obsessively
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.400]  like lift my wrist every time. Right. But I think that's a 38 42 factor. You know, like Joanna
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:20.080]  Stern and I were talking about it, like Apple's promised battery life is all for the 38. And then
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.640]  they just say in real small print, the 42 will get longer battery life in most contexts. And so
[1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:29.440]  but they don't say how much more because they don't want people to feel bad about their 38. They
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:34.400]  just want you to get the one that's going to fit fit you right. And I really feel it's sorry.
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.960]  Good. Well, I just think that the battery life is not an issue. Yeah, it's not. It's not going to
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:45.520]  screw anybody at the end of the day. Like when they need to do whatever thing, you get used to
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:52.240]  every every night you click in the charger and and that's and that's all you need to do. It's like
[1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:56.400]  yeah, like you like you said, you never have to think about it. And there are so many things like
[1:25:56.400 --> 1:26:03.600]  that that you don't have to think about. And I think it's great. It's just becoming more
[1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:07.120]  in the tech is becoming more and more seamless and visible and invisible.
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:14.720]  I'm going to take a break. Thank our next sponsor. And it is our good friend once again
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:20.320]  from fracture. Fracture is you know these guys. You go there. You give them your picture.
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:24.960]  They print it directly on glass. They've got a code during fireball just all one word.
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:30.160]  You save 15%. You go there. They've got all the sizes that you want. Little square ones
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:35.440]  big. I think 23 by 29. I forget what the big square one they have. They're 20 something inches
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.400]  if you have a square photo. And quite frankly, probably half a photo is I take these days or
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:45.760]  squares because I'm framing them for Instagram. So it's a way one way to think of it. Take
[1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:50.480]  your Instagram and make it real. And then you send it to them and they print it on this beautiful
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:57.360]  glass. And then you've got this beautiful analog version of the photo to so we can not be staring
[1:26:57.360 --> 1:27:04.320]  at electronic screen for 10 seconds of the day. Fracture makes it happen. Probably let's face it
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:07.600]  by the time the show airs. It might be a little too close to Mother's Day. You should listen to me
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:12.080]  last week when I told you to get your mom or your wife or your sister, whoever else is celebrating
[1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:16.960]  Mother's Day, get them a fracture. Maybe you listen to me. Maybe you already did it. But there's
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:21.120]  all sorts of other holidays coming up. And it's never a bad time to buy one. So it's probably too
[1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:26.960]  late from Mother's Day. But it is a great gift. It is their wonderful decorations. And they really,
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:33.840]  I just cannot say enough over and over again just how amazing the quality is and how convenient it is
[1:27:33.840 --> 1:27:39.280]  that you don't never have to worry about. You ever have like a frame? You get a picture like a
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:46.720]  photo printed. And then the piece of paper that the photo is on is off center inside the frame. And
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:51.120]  then you have to unhook this whole thing and take all these clasps off and take the cardboard off
[1:27:51.120 --> 1:27:54.640]  and then re-square it and then hope that when you put it all back together again that doesn't
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:58.560]  shift again. You don't have to worry about any of that. It's just right there on the glass,
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:05.200]  edge to edge, no bezel, ready to go in a wall, ready to be propped up on your desk. Can't say
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:08.320]  enough good things about it. People keep ordering them. That's why they keep sponsoring the show.
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:14.080]  But they're really, really good. They're a great company. And they, I don't know, nobody else,
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:21.280]  to my knowledge, has a product, anything like this. So go to their website. FractureMe.com. That's
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:26.400]  their website, FractureMe.com. And remember the code during Fireball. You'll save 15% off their,
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:32.240]  they're already delightful competitive prices. You're getting really good at that.
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:36.560]  I love Fracture. I love these guys. But they keep coming back. It's like, you guys want to seriously
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.000]  want to sponsor every week. And they're like, yes, because people keep walking with pictures for us.
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:45.600]  And we'll last week, you made me by an automatic for my mom for Mother's Day. Oh, man,
[1:28:45.600 --> 1:28:51.760]  that's a great Mother's Day gift. She's going to like it. Dang this for your car. How's your
[1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:57.760]  dad? Is your dad still over? And he's back. He got back two days ago. Thanks for asking.
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:07.280]  I was worried about him. Yeah, he got out. So he was leading a crew of volunteers doing a dental
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:13.840]  clinic. He does that every year in Nepal. He goes to India as well. And they do Guatemala.
[1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:19.200]  And so he's leading a crew in Nepal when he had been there for a few days when the earthquake hit.
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:26.480]  And basically sort of shut down the building damaged a lot of the building where they
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:31.280]  were, where they do the clinic. So they couldn't do the clinic. But then it was just about
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:36.640]  getting all these volunteers out safely. And you know, flights are shut down for many days.
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:45.040]  And then once everybody was safe and out with very minimal communication with the rest of my
[1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:53.040]  family, we didn't quite know what was going on. He managed to get out and landed a couple days
[1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:57.280]  ago. And he was on the news. And I haven't watched it yet. I have a link in my inbox.
[1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:03.920]  So that'll be fun. You can put that in the show notes. That's an amazing story. And it's a great
[1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:10.320]  thing that your dad does. Your dad was a dentist or is a dentist. No, he's retired. He's a kid's
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:17.920]  dentist, a spaceship dentist. His a spaceship's were all basically sort of pseudo star wars
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:23.920]  themed with like, you know, mechanical doors, automatic doors. That's in other words, that's
[1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:27.360]  what you that's what you that's what you as a patient as when you would sit in like a little
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:31.280]  starship captain's chair and then you'd get teeth cleaned. Is that what you're saying? There were
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:35.760]  yeah, there were video monitors everywhere, you know, old school 80s video monitors. There was
[1:30:35.760 --> 1:30:40.240]  like star field. I think he had like real production designers do the interiors
[1:30:40.240 --> 1:30:45.680]  of the offices when when he came up with this idea and everything was in that light gray kind of
[1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:52.800]  Star Wars inside spaceship. Yeah, aesthetic is pretty neat as a kid. And like robots and things.
[1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:57.200]  Yeah, it makes being a dentist cool. I mean, honestly, but anyway, what a great story. Glad to hear
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:03.280]  that he's okay. Yeah, he's okay. Thank you for asking. Well, of course. I love your dad.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:07.360]  I haven't seen him. Okay. Yeah, no, he used to go to Mac world.
[1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:13.360]  Right here. This is like the coolest dad ever spaceship dentists chairs and took you to Mac world.
[1:31:15.520 --> 1:31:20.080]  Yeah, he's a good guy. I'll I'll I'll convince him to go again so he can come out.
[1:31:21.440 --> 1:31:27.120]  He was when the earthquake hit he was like he was getting acupuncture done. And he had like
[1:31:27.120 --> 1:31:34.480]  electrodes hooked up to his his feet. And he had his eyes closed and then opened his eyes and
[1:31:34.480 --> 1:31:39.040]  noticed that the whole world was shaking and things were falling off the shelf. Everybody was
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:44.480]  running out of the the office where he was and he just ended up running out of the office with
[1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:49.120]  the electrodes strapped to his feet. No way. Yeah, I thought you were going to say that he thought
[1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:54.160]  that maybe the electrodes are like or too powerful. Like maybe you may. Yeah, I who knows what goes
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:58.480]  through your mind. I don't know. It's not a natural thing for a human to experience. No, definitely
[1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:03.520]  not. I mean, and even though you guys as as Californians are probably more accustomed to thinking
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:09.760]  about earthquakes. Sure. But I don't know. It would drive me. I would it would be the last thing
[1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:13.360]  that would occur to me. I would be like what the hell is going on? And then like a minute later
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:18.240]  someone say that was an earthquake dummy. And I'd be like, Oh, of course, but doesn't it doesn't
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:25.600]  even occur to me. Yeah, no, I mean, it was huge. It was huge. It was huge. All right, here's an
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:30.800]  idea that's popping up in my head with the watch. I mean, here what you think is as we go and trying
[1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:35.680]  to think this is exactly between, you know, nitty gritty details on the watch today and big
[1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:40.720]  picture thoughts, like what's it going to be like in five years? Is like one thing I can't imagine
[1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:46.240]  not or having on the watch because I can't figure out how they would how they would do the angles
[1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:50.640]  to make it practical is how would they put a camera on it? Yeah, I mean, like it's interesting.
[1:32:51.280 --> 1:32:56.160]  You said that because I think that's the number one missing thing right now.
[1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:03.600]  Hardware wise. And I did to me would be it would be pretty natural. I don't think it would be a
[1:33:03.600 --> 1:33:09.840]  front facing camera that like looks up at you because I think what the the main use case of it
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:15.120]  is that you want to shoot a picture of something else besides your face. It's not a face time
[1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:23.360]  camera. It's a you want to avoid that seven seconds delay between reaching, you know, seeing
[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:27.600]  something you don't want to take a picture of reaching your pocket and launching the camera out
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.640]  shooting the picture. You want to avoid that. So you just raise your arm and the camera is pointing
[1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:38.640]  outwards and there's your camera. And I feel like that cuts the experience down to maybe what
[1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:44.880]  two and a half, three seconds. And I can already think of a number of times, you know, I have a
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:51.920]  two year old. You can never know what you never know what amazing funny thing he's going to do next
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:58.320]  and there's there there've already been lots of times when I when I've thought if I've only
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:03.760]  got I could raise my wrist and shoot that. Yeah, I well, I think that you know for for reasons
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:10.800]  trivial, you know, like hey, I want to be able to shoot my kid or my cat to to the deadly serious
[1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:19.840]  like like the current world where ordinary citizens have a phone with them within seconds of being
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:26.640]  launched at all times has changed the relationship with the police all around this country like
[1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:33.840]  a big part of what's going on with the protests in Baltimore and other cities is a lot of ways
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:39.600]  based on footage that's come out that people have shot on their phones. I give and if news is
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:43.840]  breaking, it's just getting to be at this point where it just seems like we've always got a
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:50.320]  camera with this and absolutely and the lens can be anywhere. The lens the lens is like sort of the
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:56.160]  easy part. It's this in the sensors a little bit more difficult than the capture mechanism is
[1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:03.520]  and the storage is more difficult than that. But I feel like it won't be too long where the lens
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:09.360]  is really on everybody's wrist. So where do you think they would put it that like oh I have no idea.
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:16.480]  I I am not an industrial Brazilian person. There was a there was a Samsung phone or not
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:24.400]  phone watch that that had it built into the wrist strap and yeah absolutely and what my
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:30.720]  experience with that and I love telling the stories. I was shooting a commercial where I was on
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:37.280]  camera and what they do when with wardrobe and continuity and everything is the second assistant
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:41.520]  director is their job to come over and take a picture of you after every scene so you know they
[1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:46.800]  know exactly what your wardrobe looked like. And so our second AD was all day throughout the
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:53.520]  shoot coming over with this little point and shoot camera snapping a photo you know saving it
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:36:00.560]  for continuity. And then towards the end of the day he said oh let me grab you real quick take a
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:06.800]  picture. He didn't have his camera with him so he held up his Samsung what is it gear? Yeah.
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:12.480]  Well I think there they have a couple phones called here but yeah so he lifted up his Samsung watch
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:19.600]  and he snaps a photo and says okay we're good and I was like whoa I know that the Apple watch isn't
[1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:24.480]  going to do that but I already want it to. Right I want the feature but I know that they're not
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:29.360]  going to build it and I can see why Samsung put it where they did on the strap but it made the
[1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:34.080]  strap everybody you know a lot of the reviewers said it you know the strap is not comfortable
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:39.280]  because it's you know it's got electronic circuitry between the side of your wrist and the watch face
[1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:47.360]  makes it thicker and it defeats what's clearly a central part of Apple watch's design which is this
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:55.600]  idea of band swapability. So I wouldn't go there but I can see why ergonomically they put it there.
[1:36:55.600 --> 1:37:00.720]  Anyway the tension that I see is that it seems to me like the tension is I expect to have a
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:06.240]  camera with me at all times but I also now feel like soon enough I'll be able to go with just my
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:12.400]  Apple watch and you know yeah but yet then I wouldn't have a camera with me so then I feel like
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:17.600]  therefore dot dot dot they have to add a camera eventually. Yeah well I mean it's going to be iterative
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:22.400]  and the first version of the camera on the watch if there is one is going to look like garbage
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:27.440]  just like the first you know the first camera on the iPhone look pretty bad. Do you ever go back
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:33.360]  through your your photos library and look at the first I photo or the iPhone pictures you took? Yeah
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:38.160]  yeah totally and they look terrible. Yeah and and that's okay and there wasn't a front facing
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:43.520]  camera at first and that's okay and it didn't shoot video. Yeah not shooting video. Not shooting
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:48.800]  video is one that every time it comes up now I go back and everyone I go back and I'm like wait is
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:53.600]  that right I could be double check that and I go back and I go back and I go back and I say holy
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:38:00.000]  shit it did not shoot video. It's such an integral integral part of the product now that we would
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.080]  never be without that it doesn't make sense that they would ever ship something without that.
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.480]  And you know and you just have to wonder how many of those things are not in the watch right now.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:13.120]  Right yeah I don't know I feel like there's got to be some way that they could do it. I don't
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.000]  know if it would be maybe it would be a front facing camera so you could use it for FaceTime
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:24.640]  but then if you turn your wrist away you wouldn't be able to see the framing you would just point
[1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:29.120]  your wrist at what you're shooting and hit the digital crown and it would snap a photo and then you
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:35.040]  could turn your wrist back to see what it captured. Yeah that that seems like it would be it would
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:41.600]  work I mean we're not all framing up right our iPhone snaps pretty pretty specifically anyway.
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:44.400]  Yeah I don't know I mean that's the sort of thing where I could be off pace and maybe they don't
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:48.000]  never be a camera on it but I feel like I don't know it seems to me like everything gets a camera
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:56.320]  eventually. It doesn't um everything gets smaller and faster and everything. I love that part of
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:39:02.800]  what of yours and mulches conversation where you're talking about the iPad and the rev cycles and
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:07.440]  your reasoning behind was this your reasoning or was this somebody else's that you read?
[1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:15.280]  The reasoning behind people not updating as much. It was sort of what I was thinking but it was
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:21.440]  it was better put in the words by that one comment on Dr. Drang's blog like a reader of his blog
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:29.040]  you know that was so smart I mean so you can recap it if you want. I probably won't do this
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.360]  because I probably still don't do a succinct job as that guy did but it was the basic gist was that
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:41.040]  we're only five years into this you know first iPad was five years ago so we're still in the first
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:46.080]  upgrade cycle and it seems like for a lot of people and iPad lasts you know four or five years
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.440]  and so we still haven't gotten to the point where you kind of know how many people should be
[1:39:51.440 --> 1:39:55.680]  you know if Apple is doing a good job with making new products every year how many people should
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:40:00.560]  be buying one every year because there are people are still on their first one and they're
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:06.720]  pleased with it yeah and why wouldn't they be it does it does pretty much what what you needed to do
[1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:14.800]  which is it you can browse the web you can watch video you can do some creative kind of stuff
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:22.800]  and the processor hasn't gotten that much faster and yeah Roxanna's dad still uses the version
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:29.760]  one iPad that we that I had originally bought and we gave to him because all he wants is to watch
[1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:36.080]  youtube videos all day of like classical music and architecture videos and stuff and it does it
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:42.000]  does a trick for him and it's such a is it weird to say it's kind of like a secondary device it's
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:46.560]  not I don't think it's weird to say I think it's you know it is what it is you know and I think
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:51.520]  we're going to get as time goes on we're going to get more and more secondary tertiary we're
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:55.760]  just going to surround ourselves with little displays you know and that's what the watch is another
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:01.920]  one I think is I mean well it could be but it also could be a primary like I think that the second
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:07.040]  it gets a feature that is a must-have feature that the version one doesn't have I think it
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.280]  it's not it's no longer a secondary device it's a primary device like even even like just just
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:19.920]  consider what would happen if the next if maybe two years from now it's got a camera and people
[1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:26.640]  start seeing that people who have just bought the new version to watch are take are getting all these
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:32.640]  cool cameras or whatever argument's sake it's some other feature that you can only do with
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:39.760]  version two right and like you know the fact that the iPad got a lens on it was not that killer
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:46.160]  app that the iPad needed in order for people to buy more of them I think you you can make an argument
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:56.320]  that the the iPhone one suffered from enough feature constraint that version two was where people
[1:41:56.320 --> 1:42:05.360]  started a really buy into it and it allowed them to do more things and you know how many people
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:10.880]  did you see using a version one iPhone even three years after the iPhone launched oh all the time
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:18.000]  oh really oh well no actually I guess I would say the opposite now I think well I mean the my
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.840]  question was kind of leading in the opposite direction I feel like there weren't that many people
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:25.600]  I feel like the the iPhone one kind disappeared quickly yeah it could be wrong and be
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:29.440]  yeah and because they didn't and in the grand scheme of things they didn't really sell that many
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:35.040]  in the first place I guess so yeah you're right and it could be just like as a parallel model
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:39.280]  with the with the what do you know what made me jump on that and say yes was that there's one teacher
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:45.120]  at Jonas's school who was using an original iPhone into like last year and that's so cool it's a
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:51.920]  beautiful it is a beautiful device I support I I love the device and you know I just don't think that
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:57.120]  he was you know he cared you know about the technology or whatever but it it was he just shot to
[1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:03.680]  mind is yes I saw that one teacher who was still using an old iPhone yeah but no I mean like
[1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:10.800]  with the argument I was trying to make is that the the the the iPhone one lacked so many features
[1:43:10.800 --> 1:43:18.000]  that then came out in iterative versions that it became obsolete pretty quickly that's what I
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:22.880]  that's what I was yeah that's where I was going yeah and so that didn't happen with the iPad
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:27.120]  but I think it will happen with the watch I think that the watch will start to get new things that
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:32.720]  only later versions of the watch can help yeah maybe you know I think medical centers and stuff like
[1:43:32.720 --> 1:43:38.000]  that too you know who knows what it'll be we I wouldn't I probably would not have predicted it was
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:44.240]  the camera back then because I don't think our expectation was so low for so phone cameras that I
[1:43:44.240 --> 1:43:49.040]  thought well of course these pictures aren't great it's a cell phone camera and it never that weird
[1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.720]  yeah that the landscape for video for mobile video back then was the flip camera yeah I was just
[1:43:54.720 --> 1:44:01.600]  thinking about that because when the first iPhone with video did come out it I remember comparing
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:06.480]  it against the flip and the flip still had better picture and you think like well of course it had
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:11.200]  better picture it's a dedicated camera whereas the writing was on the wall that they just could not
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:16.240]  compete with Apple in the long run then the sensor technology is advancing it it's such an amazing
[1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:22.800]  clip that it didn't take long for there to be an iPhone that blew the blew the flip away and then
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:27.520]  you know just quality wise let alone in terms of only having one device in your pocket and
[1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:35.600]  already being on the internet etc yeah um no but we have you know we have tons of videos from
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:40.560]  the earlier years of Jonas's life where you know that we're all shot on flips I don't
[1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:49.360]  know I do know where the files are but it's you know it feels like a bygone era it does but and
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:56.080]  because and like I feel like there's no longer this idea of scarce it well I don't know it's an
[1:44:56.080 --> 1:45:00.560]  interesting question do you feel like when you're when you're rolling video on your iPhone do you
[1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:05.680]  feel like storage is scarce and you want to keep it to like you want to cut the clip short obviously
[1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:10.880]  you're not going to shoot a two hour video of like you know piano recital on your iPhone or something
[1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:14.800]  like that no I don't you just don't fight that but I also the clips are going to be like a minute
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:21.200]  two minutes at the moment to the most yeah well you know it's the video story for us is weird because
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:33.200]  so Jonas was born in 2004 and so for in January and so for Christmas that year my mother-in-law
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:38.640]  got us a Panasonic mini DV camera she wanted to you know she was like I want to buy you a camera you
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:43.680]  know I want you know lots of it was wonderful and you know she said what you tell me what to get
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.680]  and I got it you know I don't know you know like a consumer you know dad was a dad camera from 2004
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:55.280]  I thought it was cool how small didn't mini DV was you know but then you know but it's like
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:03.520]  so first few years of his life like 2004 2005 2006 especially it's all shot on mini DV tapes
[1:46:04.960 --> 1:46:12.080]  and I because they were tapes then you to me you're once you get over halfway down with your
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:16.800]  tape you're like well I'll just keep shooting because you know it it'll say you know like the
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:21.280]  and a little sticker on the tape that says Mother's Day 2006 or something like that but it's like
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:24.400]  I might as well just shoot the rest of the tape though because the next time I want to shoot
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:29.680]  something I want to start with a fresh tape yeah so I think that those early years of his life
[1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:35.040]  where I was shooting mini DV there's a lot of filler footage where I just let the camera go because
[1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:41.280]  I figured I'd rather just use up the tape and then the next era is the flip era where most of
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:46.800]  the videos were shot with the flip and then they're the clips are like just as long as you want them to
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:51.680]  be and it's you know we don't need to we don't need footage of every single present being open
[1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:56.080]  on Christmas this is good we got the one where he you know was most excited and put it away
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:02.960]  yeah and did you think that when you had a flip did you think of those videos as files no no
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:08.720]  not really but I was always glad though that they would be more easily put on a hard drive
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:13.200]  you know and moved from computer to computer than the DVD the mini DV tapes which I've still
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:20.000]  never really dealt with yeah I'm just so thankful now that we're moving to the side you know
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:26.720]  cliche but the the era of the cloud and that literally you know it took five days for everything
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:35.760]  to sync when I migrated to photos but my 25,000 photos and my 2000 videos that I've shot are all
[1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:39.920]  somewhere protected in the cloud and I never have to worry about cassettes I never have to worry
[1:47:39.920 --> 1:47:47.280]  about you know obsolete disc formats hard drives all that stuff is just like it's somebody else's
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:53.440]  problem now and and it's not there's no barrier to going and recalling it I don't need a deck
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:57.760]  to play all that stuff I don't need a special cable right it's just it's just there I think that's
[1:47:57.760 --> 1:48:04.960]  a beautiful beautiful thing that I mean a lot of lip services paid to it because everybody's you
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:12.080]  know the cloud is it is what it's the it's the golden I can't even think of the cleat the you
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:18.080]  know the words to express what I was trying to say the cloud is so whatever it's just it's
[1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:24.880]  trite at this point but it's very real like the the story data storage is sort of disappeared and
[1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:29.040]  we don't have to worry about it anymore yeah I like the way I to me it feels like magic when I take
[1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:33.440]  and I take more screenshots with my stupid watch than those people because I'm thinking about
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:37.920]  tweeting things like about a stupid UI or maybe thinking about a fun article or whatever
[1:48:37.920 --> 1:48:42.000]  but it's really cool to me that when you do it and you take a screenshot it just shows up on your
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:49.360]  phone and then I was like texting them from my phone to myself or air dropping them air dropping
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:53.680]  them to my Mac and then I thought I thought you know what I bet they just show up in a new photos
[1:48:53.680 --> 1:48:58.400]  app and I went to the new photos app and there you know it says today and there's all your screenshots
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:03.440]  they just show up you don't have to sit there and and airplane around the air drop them around
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:09.440]  yourself you just wait a couple seconds and it just shows up in photos quicker than if you would
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:16.800]  send there I mean it's it's obviously images are heavier data than something like a contact but
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:21.760]  you remember that feeling of like when when I called first got it shit together and you could add
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:26.800]  a new contact on your phone it would show up in your contacts app and your Mac instantaneously
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:31.120]  yeah or a calendar thing that's a very lightweight data it was still impressive that they got
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:35.920]  it all working especially after like mobile me but now that the fact that they can do that with
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:42.320]  images which 10 years ago we would just like you know we everything would have choked instantaneously
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:50.320]  I think that's incredible and it's it's it's really fun to watch and I think that the one thing
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:56.080]  that disappoints me is that Apple hasn't done a great job of like educating people on the fact that
[1:49:56.080 --> 1:50:03.920]  it exists and preparing them for what it what it means with everything that everybody's like
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.240]  constantly collecting with their with their devices I still kind of feel like Apple's nickel and
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:13.440]  diamond people on the cost I feel like the free tier could be significantly higher like I don't
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:18.400]  I don't mind paying four bucks a month or whatever I am for 200 gigabytes or whatever but I kind of
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:25.280]  feel like the free tier is way too stingy like there's no way it covers everybody's photos and videos
[1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.160]  and then yeah I bet they open that up pretty quickly though yeah I think so too that's that
[1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:35.520]  seems like the sort of thing that that they'll just keep every WWDC they'll announce new pricing
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:40.400]  and they'll always by the time May rolls around will always be bitching about you know how much it
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:45.920]  cost because it was prices were set a year ago all right let me take one last break and then we'll
[1:50:45.920 --> 1:50:49.840]  do the last stretch of the show but I have one more sponsor to thank and it is our good friends
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:57.120]  at hover you guys know hover HOV ER it's the best place to manage domain names ever created
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:07.120]  they simplified domain management they everything from finding a new one to transferring old ones
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:12.000]  to changing the details of the ones you already have there all of it with a great interface
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.960]  they have hundreds of TLDs now top level domains to choose from I honestly makes it harder to
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:23.600]  find a domain because now you can get the word you want but you have to choose your top level
[1:51:23.600 --> 1:51:29.520]  domain and some of them are pretty cool I saw you guys you just registered sandwich dot video
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:35.600]  right yeah it was pretty awesome a company in Vancouver that manages that domain they knew the
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:40.880]  company they knew us and so the guy emailed me there and and I snagged it as soon as it
[1:51:40.880 --> 1:51:47.360]  became so that's pretty awesome hover also has email you can add email to any of your domains
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:52.720]  so instead of using some kind of female thing for email you can get you know your name at
[1:51:52.720 --> 1:51:59.040]  your domain dot com get your email right there through hover and to me here's the part that to me
[1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:05.920]  it's it is it sounds too good to be true but it's not is that they've got this thing they call
[1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:11.280]  valetransfer so you sign up for hover you become a hover customer and then if you're like me
[1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:18.160]  you've got domain names registered from x y and c registrars from like 1995 until today and are
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:22.640]  all over the place and the other companies are that great and you really just want them all under
[1:52:22.640 --> 1:52:28.480]  one roof you don't have to do all that work just give your credentials to log into you know
[1:52:28.480 --> 1:52:33.440]  whoever registrars you use before give them to the people that hover and their experts this is
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:40.080]  all they do is they deal with DNS and you know making sure all these transfers go by without a hitch
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:46.400]  they'll just move all of your domains from wherever and from whenever you first booked them
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:49.600]  they'll move them all into your hover account and then next thing you know like the next day
[1:52:49.600 --> 1:52:55.120]  there you go you go into log in the hover and all of your domains are right there and again it
[1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:57.920]  just sounds too good to be true because you think well you got to pay you know pay it to pay
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:02.640]  through the nose for that no that's just the domain transfer thing is just part of the service
[1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:08.880]  of being a hover customer it's just included in their customer service could not be less hassle
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:14.000]  free it's it's I can't even imagine how in theory they could make it less of a hassle to move
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:22.880]  all of your existing domains to hover all sorts of other stuff DNS management bulk management tools
[1:53:22.880 --> 1:53:29.120]  for people who have tons of domains you name it they've got it so go check them out if you have
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:35.680]  any need for a new domain name if you have an old domain name that you would like to move to
[1:53:35.680 --> 1:53:41.440]  a really cool company with a really good UI from managing it go check out hover.com and they
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:45.760]  have a promo code and here's what the deal they listen it is going to take some explanation but
[1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:50.560]  they listen to the show they're big fans of during fireball they listen to shows like the talk
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:56.480]  show and ATP so they pick the codes based on things that like I've been writing about or whatever
[1:53:56.480 --> 1:54:04.400]  so this week's code is come back kit all one word c o me b a c k i d and that's that's my
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:11.120]  nickname for a young a young New York Yankee named Alex Rodriguez who's having a good season
[1:54:11.680 --> 1:54:16.560]  come back kid it makes people angry they don't be angry at hover they picked it but I've been
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:21.280]  no one talking about it but people get angry about it because what he's coming back for from is a
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:27.680]  year long suspension from performance and answering drugs come back kid come back kid
[1:54:27.680 --> 1:54:34.960]  so my thanks to hover go check them out hover.com and the code is come back kid and then they'll
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:39.440]  know you came from here and that you you don't even have to be a fan of Alex Rodriguez but you could
[1:54:39.440 --> 1:54:43.200]  just type the code and you'll save some bucks and they'll they'll know you came from here
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:50.560]  so that looks awesome I don't I mean I was just I was looking at the site as you were talking
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:56.880]  about it I'm going to use this to register a couple of things I thought you needed to go to like
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:05.040]  shady places to to get the new TLDs no but yeah I think you did it first I think you did it first
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:12.880]  but that not anymore yeah that's cool I like when you say our good friends at because it's almost
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:19.280]  there's a little there's something a little good fellas about it you know this is my this is my
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:24.640]  good friend hover or this is our good friends at fracture when you know it makes me the thing that
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:30.560]  makes me happy about so many of these sponsors is that they come back and you know it's like to me
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:36.320]  if I I love new sponsors too and so the Rails tutorial you know thing is great first time that they
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:40.400]  sponsored the show I hope they come back hope they have a great success but the fact that the other
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:44.880]  three sponsors hello was here a couple months ago and they you know like they only signed up for one
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:48.640]  the first time and then they were so happy with the results they sold so many pillows I mean which is
[1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:54.960]  a crazy thing for me to say like I I could definitely like ten fifteen years ago imagine a world where
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:59.360]  I had some kind of talk show I wouldn't have known to call it a podcast at the time but I could
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:04.160]  have imagined doing it and I could have imagined that the way that I did it was by selling ads
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:09.360]  you know because that seems to be how shows always did work and probably always will I could
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:16.480]  not have imagined that like one of the happy sponsors of the show was selling pillows right I just
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:21.520]  doesn't it just I would not have occurred to me but anyway it's pretty cool I mean yeah however
[1:56:21.520 --> 1:56:27.840]  anybody can do any kind of business they want to know it hover has been a sponsor of the show
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:34.000]  as long as the show has had sponsors like years and years and years at some level of regularity you
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:39.360]  know at least every quarter they've they've sponsored a couple episodes so I mean it I and I sincerely
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:45.040]  mean that they're my good friends because they've you know been part of my business for for long time
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:50.320]  and I think I truly think they have a great product it's super cool let's bring it home
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:53.280]  but what are your last thoughts on the watch what do you what do you want to talk about that we
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:57:00.160]  haven't talked about yet well I mean just we talked about the future a little bit I mean I said
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:06.000]  the camera what do you what what else do you think that the watch hasn't in two or three years
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:11.600]  that it doesn't have now well I can't figure out how they'll do it but I it to me it's got
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:18.240]  again it's own networking um but then you know so you say you don't need an iPhone eventually
[1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:23.760]  is that what you're saying yeah but it's I'm not quite sure you know maybe it's just Wi-Fi
[1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:28.560]  on every probably would be at first probably the first step to that would be to have true Wi-Fi
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:34.080]  and I know that it just gets complicated because the watch does support Wi-Fi at a certain level
[1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:38.720]  but it's really just using like that back channel Wi-Fi to stay in contact with your phone while
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:43.600]  you're on the same network so like your phone can be all the way uh on the fourth floor and you're
[1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:47.920]  down in the basement you know getting close out of the dryer and it's still connected because it's
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:54.720]  on the Wi-Fi but your phone I mean your watch doesn't get on Wi-Fi like if your phone isn't with you
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:59.040]  period that's really cool I didn't realize that that's how that worked I because I'd heard that
[1:57:59.040 --> 1:58:05.440]  it had Wi-Fi but I know right because Bluetooth I the just of it is I think Bluetooth is a practical
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:10.880]  range of about 30 feet and you know I think it gets kind of sketchy at that but it definitely is
[1:58:10.880 --> 1:58:15.600]  true I've I haven't some people have asked like have I tested exactly how far away the phone can be
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:19.440]  now because I don't do reviews like that like I'm not going to sit there with a tape measure
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:24.560]  and measure whether I get text messages at 25 feet and do I get them at 26 feet and stuff like that
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:30.080]  but I've definitely had the phone way more than 30 feet away inside my house and I still get
[1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.480]  text messages and stuff like that and that's so smart because the only places you're going to be
[1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:39.600]  that far away from your phone in the first place or places where you know the Wi-Fi you have
[1:58:40.240 --> 1:58:45.600]  you're on the Wi-Fi network and it's a friendly place right otherwise you're outside of a network
[1:58:45.600 --> 1:58:50.480]  and you're you're worried about everybody stealing your stuff so you've got to be seen yeah so I
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:54.640]  don't know how the business of it would work because you know even if you buy a cellular
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:59:01.040]  iPad you still have to pay at least you know like 10 15 bucks a month to get some kind of thing
[1:59:01.040 --> 1:59:05.920]  and nobody wants to keep spending 10 15 bucks a month but there's got to be some kind of way
[1:59:05.920 --> 1:59:11.360]  I think that once they can shrink a cellular antenna and fit it in a watch and not have it you know
[1:59:12.080 --> 1:59:17.200]  decrease the battery the less than a day that it'll have independent cellular
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:21.920]  was it is it okay to is it fair to say that I don't really want that like I don't
[1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:28.880]  yeah I feel like if I stepped back to 2002 when we were hooking our iPods up to through
[1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:36.400]  firewire to our max in order to manage the libraries on if you asked me would you like if you could
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:42.960]  just have music on your iPod you didn't need to do it through your Mac or even the iPhone you
[1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:47.600]  know like the iPhone you still need to connect to your Mac at the beginning and you asked me like
[1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:51.760]  would you want that to not happen so you can just do everything anymore I'd probably say the same
[1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:57.200]  I'd probably say no I'm good I like keeping everything on my Mac and then you know just managing it
[1:59:57.200 --> 2:00:02.640]  there yeah I think you're under estimate I don't think it's because and again it's not because
[2:00:02.640 --> 2:00:07.040]  I think that you want to do a lot on your watch without the phone because again I don't
[2:00:07.040 --> 2:00:11.200]  think that's ever going to change but I do think though that you should be able to just not
[2:00:11.200 --> 2:00:16.080]  worry about how close you are to your phone should like if you wanted to you know or in for
[2:00:16.080 --> 2:00:20.480]  exercising I think that's a huge one is that you don't have to have your stupid phone you know
[2:00:20.480 --> 2:00:25.840]  strapped to your arm in a band or whatever and that you can just go for a run for five miles
[2:00:25.840 --> 2:00:30.240]  and if an important notification comes in you're still going to get it so I think it's got to
[2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:34.400]  happen eventually but I don't know you'd have to switch to some kind of plan where everything is
[2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:39.040]  sort of all a cart you know you just sign up you give Verizon $100 a month then you get all of your
[2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:44.960]  devices it sort of works like that with a family plan now but yeah I could see it I could see that
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:50.240]  and I know because I'm not I was almost missed it but GPS is another one and I know that the people
[2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:55.200]  who run and bicycle are that's like the number one thing that they they feel like this first one's
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:01.280]  missing that makes sense I mean the first iPhone didn't have GPS and it felt like you had to do this
[2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:07.600]  bullshit triangulating to get your location on a map which seemed like a jet but I feel like the
[2:01:08.800 --> 2:01:14.480]  it's not a price not a concern for me I'm not an avid sportsman so I like maybe it's that's why
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:22.320]  but I have GPS pretty accurate GPS on my phone so I don't think anybody's sweating yeah but the
[2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:26.400]  exercise you know the people who are really in the fitness wanted they want to go without the
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.080]  phone they want to just because the watch is so much better then you don't have this you know
[2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:37.200]  if there's just no good way to run with the phone on the really and they just want to go and do it
[2:01:37.200 --> 2:01:42.320]  and that you know without GPS they feel like they can't because like there's so many of these apps
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:47.520]  for like bicycling where they have like they already have like three years of like every single
[2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:51.760]  bike ride they've had they have an exact map of where they've gone and they don't want to lose it
[2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:54.640]  same way that we were talking before about with the watch we're now that you've got the watch
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:58.560]  on for a week and you've got like this week worth of activity things you want to keep wearing the
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:01.680]  watch tomorrow because you want to you don't want to you don't want to lose that
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:06.880]  skip the day yes but they've already got they're already used to having that GPS data
[2:02:08.320 --> 2:02:12.160]  well I keep my phone in the little fanny pack like they have they make these like really slim
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:17.680]  profile of fanny packs that you can wear when you're right I don't laugh at me really really
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:22.560]  I left John group really cool fanny packs this is what you're saying well you can't even it's
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:33.520]  very low profile you can't even see it under the sports broke but it's okay so like cable tweeted
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:43.200]  the other day was it cable or maybe somebody tweeted regardless he had a waiter asked him
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:48.800]  if I saw his watch and said oh you have the new iPhone watch and I thought that was kind of
[2:02:48.800 --> 2:02:55.120]  fascinating that it's I mean a waiter asked me yesterday yesterday oh can I see your eye watch
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:59.680]  can you can you show me what it does I watch makes sense whatever that's the that's the go-to
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:05.600]  iPhone watch made different kind of sense because that means that people are some people are just
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:12.400]  naturally associating with the hub being the computer that it sort of connects to being the iPhone
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:17.840]  I think that's kind of cool on top of which it kind of looks like an iPhone 6
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:25.280]  it yeah and I think it kind of it does it is an interesting way to say it and it does sort of
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:31.840]  I wonder whether in touch side Apple how much they were worried about the fact that they're selling
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:38.000]  it as a thing you have to have with an iPhone you know that it is that a bitter pill for people to
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:43.040]  swallow that this thing really needs to be in within 30 feet of your iPhone at all times to have
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:50.160]  functionality I don't think so I think I could be wrong but I think people would look at people
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:55.280]  like myself would look at as an advantage I think it's awesome it's like a tetherless tether
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:02.480]  and where I mean it what it just means to me is that it makes my watch that much powerful gives my
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:08.400]  imbues my watch with the power of an iPhone which has been working for eight years to be as powerful
[2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:13.680]  as it is really the one thing that really struck me early on was how much the watch
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:18.000]  wants to be in contact with your iPhone because as soon as it's out of range of your iPhone like if
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:24.160]  you power your iPhone off you get like what in my opinion is almost an ugly icon not ugly like
[2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:28.800]  that it was poorly drawn but because it's like a red you know what I mean it's like up where the
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:33.680]  note if you know what you what are you so which one so if you turn your phone off the watch
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:38.880]  gets a little icon up at the top a little red it's like a little red phone with a line through it
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:43.760]  like it's saying I can't I can't find my you know the phone that I'm paired with and there's no
[2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:48.960]  it's there's no way to get rid of that icon until you're back in range of the phone like and it's
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:56.240]  just a it at first I thought wow they really made that glaring but then I realized using it that
[2:04:56.240 --> 2:05:01.200]  it's because the watch really does want to be within range of the phone at all time like it's
[2:05:01.200 --> 2:05:08.000]  it's like lacking an oxygen when it's not not doesn't have the phone totally um how cool is that
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:15.840]  pairing process of pointing your phone at your watch I think it's so great and I think I you know
[2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:21.600]  I'm guilty as charged that I haven't sung its praises enough but I feel like it's unheralded how
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:28.240]  good the pairing process is incredible beautiful could have been a QR code thank god it wasn't
[2:05:29.120 --> 2:05:34.800]  just like magical yeah I can't I can't think of a I the last time I had an experience with
[2:05:34.800 --> 2:05:40.400]  tech that was that magical is with the first time I slid the power on the I the first iPhone
[2:05:40.400 --> 2:05:44.640]  and it showed me the picture of the world I was like holy crap this is a magical thing
[2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:54.960]  that unboxing experience of point your phone at your at the weird magic eye type yeah graphic on
[2:05:54.960 --> 2:06:02.320]  your on your watch that was just some smart smart consumer technology yeah and it's as as it syncs
[2:06:02.320 --> 2:06:09.120]  the first time it uh to me the animation is just gorgeous it's very simple very you know but it
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:16.880]  but it's they sweat so many details in that process so like the there's a watch on the phone like
[2:06:16.880 --> 2:06:22.800]  a picture of a watch on the phone as the phone app is syncing with the watch and the animation
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:28.800]  on the fake watch that's shown on the phone it stays in perfect sync with the animation you know
[2:06:28.800 --> 2:06:36.560]  the the progress spinner on on the watch itself it's so cool it's just signaling to you these two
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:41.440]  things are connected um and I and I feel like maybe even a perfect way of
[2:06:42.720 --> 2:06:49.520]  summing up or like capping the show is like you told me when we were texting back and forth when
[2:06:49.520 --> 2:06:54.640]  you had the watch and I didn't yet and you told and you said I realized what and it started you
[2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:59.440]  wrote this piece about it anyway but you said I realized what the phone it or what the watch is
[2:07:00.080 --> 2:07:05.840]  what what what what it's just a really cool digital watch yeah it's a cool as digital watch it's
[2:07:05.840 --> 2:07:13.520]  it's it's like the most sophisticated digital watch you've ever seen um uh and and and you know it
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:22.640]  does and I think the most futuristic thing probably in that old world context of what is a watch
[2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:28.080]  is like that you can make phone calls with it I think that's pretty awesome um it's not something
[2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:33.120]  that I would put into practice hardly ever I think it's awesome that my watch rings when I get
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:37.520]  a new call and I can decline it from there but I would never like especially in front of people
[2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:42.960]  I would never like take a call on my watch and just start talking to me it seems like a weird thing
[2:07:42.960 --> 2:07:50.160]  to do that um but it is a super futuristic and bond like um but to me I think if I were to summarize
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:56.400]  what the watch is I would say it's a really cool second screen for your iPhone yeah yeah I would
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:03.600]  totally agree um and it's strapped to your body so it's always there um I will say this I have
[2:08:03.600 --> 2:08:08.080]  to say this before we go because we didn't really talk about the touch the touch communication
[2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:12.560]  uh yeah but that's hard for you to talk about here's the thing it's hard for you to talk about
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:18.480]  though because Roxanna doesn't have well you have hers and you don't have yours yeah so like she's
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:26.320]  the most intimate person you know connected to me so I have yet to try that out um and so like I
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:31.920]  I mean you you sent me a tap message um that I only just got like when we were halfway through the
[2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:36.640]  show because I was ignored I know that was my way of like I wanted it to be like are you ready
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:41.200]  yeah okay that was that that that's that's nice I just did like I sent you an old
[2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:48.400]  fashion text like a grandpa right um and it's like I so I have yet to prove out that use case
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:54.400]  I think for myself whether it's a heartbeat or whether it's like drawing a sketch to me the screen
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:59.200]  is way too small to draw anything meaningful and for some reason the only thing I can think to draw
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:04.880]  is a dick and I don't want to do that the next meaningful thing is a happy face and I don't want
[2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:12.160]  to do that either so I just end up not using I send a lot of happy faces um no but you know I said
[2:09:12.160 --> 2:09:18.240]  this before it's it's and it's so true is that for those features and so many people after my
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:22.160]  initial review came up there like did you have any did did Apple give you did they give you two so
[2:09:22.160 --> 2:09:28.080]  you can test the drawing and the way that we tested the drawing was we I could send taps and
[2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:34.080]  hard beats and doodles to people who worked at Apple um but I know and I did it just to see
[2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:39.600]  that it worked but it always felt a little weird because it's like all of those communications
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:44.880]  seem way too informal and the heartbeat one to me really does I hate to use the word because it
[2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:48.720]  sounds corny but it really is a little intimate it just doesn't seem like something you would
[2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:53.760]  send to somebody you have a professional relationship with right what do you do me a favor as an
[2:09:53.760 --> 2:10:00.160]  experiment I've got you I've got a tap message queued up for you I'm just going to try drawing
[2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:04.000]  something all right all right because this is the first time I've done this in real time okay
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:22.320]  did it go nine get it all right somebody seems to sometimes a little latent so I don't know
[2:10:22.320 --> 2:10:32.320]  I'll send you a couple taps oh yeah I'm getting your taps that that's kind of nice like raindrops
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:35.600]  so wait what am I supposed to I don't even know what I'm supposed to do which is draw a picture
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:41.200]  okay but did you add me to the yeah you're in my favor all right
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:47.360]  I don't think I'm getting it all right now all right now all right there it is
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:53.760]  all right so it works
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:01.520]  it's an action shot
[2:11:06.240 --> 2:11:10.400]  I did that the down ripple I kind of guess when down ripple was going to get a review
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:13.840]  and I was checking and you can tell if somebody has an apple watch because then when you put
[2:11:13.840 --> 2:11:19.440]  them in your friends and you go to their friends they they get the third button down underneath
[2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:23.040]  you know instead of just phone call and text you can also send them a digital touch so I just
[2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:28.240]  kept waiting for Dowermple to get the digital touch and as soon as he did I sent him a similar drawing
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:36.560]  so I could so that I could be first oh that's great that feels good uh well Adam Lisa Gore
