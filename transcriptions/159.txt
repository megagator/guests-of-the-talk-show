[00:00.000 --> 00:01.820]  Here's what I got for us to talk about.
[00:01.820 --> 00:07.500]  WWDC, the live talk show at WWDC.
[00:07.500 --> 00:09.660]  Mac OS, or what's it called?
[00:09.660 --> 00:10.260]  Mac OS.
[00:10.260 --> 00:11.580]  Mac OS 10.12.
[00:11.580 --> 00:12.540]  I've lost track.
[00:12.540 --> 00:13.260]  iOS 10.
[00:13.260 --> 00:15.020]  Watch OS 3.
[00:15.020 --> 00:19.220]  Taking the headphone jack off the iPhone.
[00:19.220 --> 00:21.540]  Covering your laptop cameras with tape.
[00:21.540 --> 00:24.220]  Podcast ads, the future of podcasting and mid-roll,
[00:24.220 --> 00:26.340]  buying Stitcher.
[00:26.340 --> 00:28.220]  And then at the end, we can talk about cars
[00:28.220 --> 00:31.660]  and talk about the shitty shifter design that
[00:31.660 --> 00:34.340]  led to the guy from Star Trek stuff.
[00:34.340 --> 00:37.220]  So short show.
[00:37.220 --> 00:39.220]  So let's get started, WWDC.
[00:39.220 --> 00:41.620]  We don't have to talk about the actual announcements.
[00:41.620 --> 00:43.900]  Everyone's heard about those already.
[00:43.900 --> 00:45.380]  I want to talk about your show.
[00:45.380 --> 00:46.180]  All right.
[00:46.180 --> 00:49.860]  Because I have some to say about it,
[00:49.860 --> 00:51.620]  and you probably won't be saying all this.
[00:51.620 --> 00:53.460]  So I will say it, because you won't.
[00:53.460 --> 00:59.300]  So number one is, first of all, I greatly enjoyed it.
[00:59.300 --> 01:03.260]  You began the show by posing the question of,
[01:03.260 --> 01:04.460]  you had Phil on last year.
[01:04.460 --> 01:06.020]  How do you top that?
[01:06.020 --> 01:08.980]  There's only so far you can go up the chain
[01:08.980 --> 01:12.100]  to top having Phil on the show.
[01:12.100 --> 01:16.180]  And you ended up having Phil and Craig on the show this year.
[01:16.180 --> 01:19.860]  And I put forth now this theory that that is the top.
[01:19.860 --> 01:23.500]  That is the best you can do for that show in that week.
[01:23.500 --> 01:24.340]  I agree with that.
[01:24.340 --> 01:27.100]  I think that's actually probably true.
[01:27.100 --> 01:31.980]  Because I think I successfully kept it secret, number one.
[01:31.980 --> 01:33.980]  I don't know what the people were whispering out
[01:33.980 --> 01:34.700]  in the audience.
[01:34.700 --> 01:36.980]  I was guessing Tim, but I had no idea.
[01:36.980 --> 01:40.180]  Yeah, Tim, that was by far the most common guess.
[01:40.180 --> 01:43.340]  And people were bugging me like the day, not bugging me.
[01:43.340 --> 01:43.940]  I shouldn't say that.
[01:43.940 --> 01:45.620]  Everybody who came up and said hi to me at WWDC,
[01:45.620 --> 01:46.420]  I always enjoy it.
[01:46.420 --> 01:48.500]  And sometimes I see people on Twitter who say,
[01:48.500 --> 01:49.940]  hey, I saw you somewhere.
[01:49.940 --> 01:51.340]  And I thought, oh, I won't bother you.
[01:51.340 --> 01:52.380]  No, just come say hi.
[01:52.380 --> 01:53.300]  I like to say hi to people.
[01:53.300 --> 01:53.820]  It's great.
[01:53.820 --> 01:55.780]  It's one of my favorite parts of WWDC.
[01:55.780 --> 01:57.900]  And it was really weird for me in the early years,
[01:57.900 --> 02:00.860]  because it does not come naturally to me.
[02:00.860 --> 02:02.180]  But I've learned over the years.
[02:02.180 --> 02:03.500]  I met you during that period.
[02:03.500 --> 02:06.980]  I've learned over the years how to make
[02:06.980 --> 02:08.180]  those things go pretty well.
[02:08.180 --> 02:10.420]  Pretty much what I did was the one year at South by Southwest
[02:10.420 --> 02:10.940]  I was hanging out.
[02:10.940 --> 02:13.380]  It was the year Merlin and I spoke together at South by.
[02:13.380 --> 02:17.540]  And I just noticed that when people would come up to us,
[02:17.540 --> 02:20.780]  whether they knew Merlin, Merlin is amazing.
[02:20.780 --> 02:23.100]  He's absolutely amazing when someone comes up and says,
[02:23.100 --> 02:24.420]  hey, are you Merlin, man?
[02:24.420 --> 02:25.420]  He's obviously never met them.
[02:25.420 --> 02:26.100]  They're a fan.
[02:26.100 --> 02:27.060]  He's so good at it.
[02:27.060 --> 02:29.180]  And I just suddenly went into, I'm
[02:29.180 --> 02:34.460]  just going to copy his moves and just do what he does.
[02:34.460 --> 02:35.660]  And it's gotten a lot better.
[02:35.660 --> 02:36.900]  So anyway, people would come up to you.
[02:36.900 --> 02:37.980]  They'd say, blah, blah, blah.
[02:37.980 --> 02:39.460]  But then they'd say, who's going to be on your show?
[02:39.460 --> 02:41.500]  And I would just say, I started saying to them,
[02:41.500 --> 02:42.980]  you don't really want me to tell you, right?
[02:42.980 --> 02:44.380]  I mean, you want to be surprised.
[02:44.380 --> 02:45.500]  I'm not going to tell you.
[02:45.500 --> 02:48.060]  And I don't know what the listeners think, but like,
[02:48.060 --> 02:49.340]  so you and I are friends.
[02:49.340 --> 02:51.220]  I didn't know either, last year or this year.
[02:51.220 --> 02:53.140]  You don't even tell your friends.
[02:53.140 --> 02:55.980]  As far as I know, the only people you tell are Amy and Paul
[02:55.980 --> 02:57.460]  who are working the event with you.
[02:57.460 --> 02:58.780]  You don't tell anybody.
[02:58.780 --> 02:59.660]  I didn't tell Paul.
[02:59.660 --> 03:00.140]  Amy did.
[03:03.820 --> 03:07.580]  And Caleb Sexton knew as of like 3 or 4
[03:07.580 --> 03:09.860]  in the afternoon of the day.
[03:09.860 --> 03:14.220]  And I did tell Caleb to prepare three lav mics.
[03:14.220 --> 03:15.980]  So he knew there would be two guests.
[03:15.980 --> 03:17.460]  But no, I did not tell anybody.
[03:17.460 --> 03:18.940]  Because that's how you keep a secret.
[03:18.940 --> 03:19.980]  How do you keep a secret?
[03:19.980 --> 03:20.500]  It's easy.
[03:20.500 --> 03:22.060]  Don't tell anybody.
[03:22.060 --> 03:26.820]  I swear to God, it sounds stupid,
[03:26.820 --> 03:30.940]  but most people don't do that.
[03:30.940 --> 03:32.980]  Amy tells me a great story.
[03:32.980 --> 03:35.220]  I'm going to butcher this in some way.
[03:35.220 --> 03:37.500]  But when she was in law school, she
[03:37.500 --> 03:41.860]  had a criminal defense course that
[03:41.860 --> 03:44.980]  was taught by a former FBI agent.
[03:44.980 --> 03:47.020]  And he told them, he said, you want
[03:47.020 --> 03:48.700]  to know how to get away with a murder,
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.300]  it's actually very easy.
[03:50.300 --> 03:52.500]  Don't leave any evidence.
[03:52.500 --> 03:55.260]  Don't leave any evidence behind.
[03:55.260 --> 03:57.220]  Don't tell anyone what you did.
[03:57.220 --> 03:58.540]  And don't ever do it again.
[03:58.540 --> 04:02.740]  And you'll get away with it.
[04:02.740 --> 04:04.340]  Useful information for law students.
[04:04.340 --> 04:06.500]  Most murderers do not get away with it.
[04:06.500 --> 04:09.740]  Because most murderers either leave something behind
[04:09.740 --> 04:13.460]  or, most commonly, they tell somebody.
[04:13.460 --> 04:14.740]  Very, very easy.
[04:14.740 --> 04:16.380]  I didn't murder anybody, but I did not
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.780]  tell anybody who was going to be on the show.
[04:17.780 --> 04:21.580]  And I agree with your assessment that the duo of Phil and Craig
[04:21.580 --> 04:24.180]  is, I think, unbeatable.
[04:24.180 --> 04:26.020]  Tim Cook would be a bigger get.
[04:26.020 --> 04:28.620]  Johnny Ive would be a big get.
[04:28.620 --> 04:31.780]  But I don't think that the combination
[04:31.780 --> 04:34.020]  of my interviewing skills combined
[04:34.020 --> 04:35.900]  with their personalities, I don't
[04:35.900 --> 04:37.380]  think would be as enjoyable.
[04:37.380 --> 04:40.220]  Well, especially in this setting, too.
[04:40.220 --> 04:42.260]  You are there, and you want to talk about what
[04:42.260 --> 04:43.460]  was just said in the keynote.
[04:43.460 --> 04:44.900]  And we've seen interviews of Tim.
[04:44.900 --> 04:46.940]  Tim doesn't really stray from the talking points.
[04:46.940 --> 04:49.460]  He's very well-prepared, very well-controlled.
[04:49.460 --> 04:52.260]  And he says what he wants to say and nothing more.
[04:52.260 --> 04:54.020]  And what you really want that everybody
[04:54.020 --> 04:59.060]  to see in the talk show, because the live talk show is still
[04:59.060 --> 04:59.580]  your show.
[04:59.580 --> 05:00.780]  It's still the talk show.
[05:00.780 --> 05:05.500]  And the mood of it takes on what you set there.
[05:05.500 --> 05:09.020]  So it's kind of like you say that this
[05:09.020 --> 05:11.820]  is the director's commentary for Daring Fireball.
[05:11.820 --> 05:14.500]  When you have these Apple execs on your show, which
[05:14.500 --> 05:16.340]  I love that now two years in, it just
[05:16.340 --> 05:18.300]  has become like, oh, this is just what you do now.
[05:18.300 --> 05:19.760]  Last year it was like, holy crap.
[05:19.760 --> 05:21.540]  This year it's like, oh, yeah, again, OK.
[05:21.540 --> 05:24.660]  But when you have them on the show,
[05:24.660 --> 05:29.060]  it kind of becomes the director's commentary for WWDC.
[05:29.060 --> 05:31.860]  Because it is like, mood-wise, it's
[05:31.860 --> 05:34.020]  like the closest that any of us will ever
[05:34.020 --> 05:39.100]  get to sitting down and having a beer with Apple executives.
[05:39.100 --> 05:40.980]  And I think Phil and Craig not only
[05:40.980 --> 05:43.740]  have very good personalities that mesh well with that.
[05:43.740 --> 05:48.660]  But also topic-wise, at WWDC, if there's any two Apple execs
[05:48.660 --> 05:50.740]  you can pick to ask questions to that are going
[05:50.740 --> 05:53.460]  to be interesting and relevant to developers
[05:53.460 --> 05:55.740]  after having heard that keynote that day,
[05:55.740 --> 05:56.820]  it's going to be those two.
[05:56.820 --> 05:59.140]  Because you have Phil, who now runs the entire app store,
[05:59.140 --> 06:00.060]  policy-wise at least.
[06:00.060 --> 06:01.260]  He runs the whole app store.
[06:01.260 --> 06:04.580]  And then he's also kind of like, I
[06:04.580 --> 06:06.940]  don't know what his role is unofficially,
[06:06.940 --> 06:11.900]  but it seems like he is in many ways heavily involved
[06:11.900 --> 06:14.900]  or possibly the head of a lot of product decisions.
[06:14.900 --> 06:18.820]  Yeah, I've always said, and maybe I should have asked.
[06:18.820 --> 06:20.180]  I've always had this on my list.
[06:20.180 --> 06:21.980]  What would you say you do here?
[06:21.980 --> 06:24.780]  Well, I have had that, and I've run out of time.
[06:24.780 --> 06:26.380]  I have both ears.
[06:26.380 --> 06:28.140]  It's better that way, but I have more stuff
[06:28.140 --> 06:32.980]  to talk to them about than I have time to ask them.
[06:32.980 --> 06:36.140]  And I tend to favor, hey, let's fill this up
[06:36.140 --> 06:37.580]  with questions from the keynote.
[06:37.580 --> 06:42.060]  Because I think it's more relevant to now than forever.
[06:42.060 --> 06:43.140]  But I have ideas.
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.420]  I go into it with a couple ideas for things
[06:45.420 --> 06:47.580]  to talk about just in case the keynote doesn't really
[06:47.580 --> 06:49.220]  have a lot of stuff.
[06:49.220 --> 06:52.700]  But I've always said, from my perspective on the outside,
[06:52.700 --> 06:55.220]  the best way to understand Schiller's role at Apple
[06:55.220 --> 06:57.460]  would be to take the word marketing out of his name
[06:57.460 --> 06:59.420]  and edit title and that he's senior vice
[06:59.420 --> 07:00.900]  president of product.
[07:00.900 --> 07:03.540]  Because the marketing is in and of itself,
[07:03.540 --> 07:04.860]  it's part of the product.
[07:04.860 --> 07:05.940]  It's not a separate thing.
[07:05.940 --> 07:07.500]  It's not like the products are developed
[07:07.500 --> 07:09.220]  and then Schiller's group figures out
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.900]  how to advertise them or what pictures
[07:10.900 --> 07:12.340]  to take to put on the box.
[07:12.340 --> 07:15.740]  It's all of a piece.
[07:15.740 --> 07:17.860]  That's the type of marketing that gives, especially
[07:17.860 --> 07:20.900]  engineers who are analytical, and they roll their eyes
[07:20.900 --> 07:22.220]  when they think about marketing.
[07:22.220 --> 07:24.340]  Bad marketing is when you start with a bad product
[07:24.340 --> 07:27.780]  and somebody is told, here's a crappy product or a thing
[07:27.780 --> 07:28.780]  with a bunch of problems.
[07:28.780 --> 07:29.980]  Figure out a way to sell it.
[07:29.980 --> 07:33.620]  Well, the marketer still has to do their job.
[07:33.620 --> 07:35.300]  But whereas if you have a good product,
[07:35.300 --> 07:36.980]  you can just let the product speak for yourself
[07:36.980 --> 07:39.480]  and figure out, how do we let the product speak for itself?
[07:39.480 --> 07:42.600]  And I think that's ideally what, at their best,
[07:42.600 --> 07:44.580]  that's how Apple's marketing works.
[07:44.580 --> 07:45.900]  And it seems too like.
[07:45.900 --> 07:48.140]  He is intimately familiar with all of their products.
[07:48.140 --> 07:49.020]  Oh, clearly.
[07:49.020 --> 07:51.260]  And also, having Craig there too,
[07:51.260 --> 07:55.940]  it's amazing because you think of what is an executive.
[07:55.940 --> 07:58.020]  And you think of what kind of person is it,
[07:58.020 --> 08:00.380]  what do they know, what kind of involvement do they have.
[08:00.380 --> 08:04.140]  And to have the kind of incredibly deep knowledge
[08:04.140 --> 08:07.380]  that these two executives have about what they apparently
[08:07.380 --> 08:11.220]  oversee with pillar and what Craig does officially oversee.
[08:11.220 --> 08:13.900]  Craig was throwing out deep technical implementation
[08:13.900 --> 08:14.980]  details.
[08:14.980 --> 08:17.860]  And I know from talking to people in the company
[08:17.860 --> 08:19.220]  that that's genuine.
[08:19.220 --> 08:22.740]  Like Craig is really a genuine, hardcore engineer.
[08:22.740 --> 08:24.940]  And he really knows his stuff.
[08:24.940 --> 08:27.860]  And he gets deeply involved in it.
[08:27.860 --> 08:29.900]  But at the same time, he's a really good leader.
[08:29.900 --> 08:33.020]  I mean, I don't think I've met anybody
[08:33.020 --> 08:35.420]  who has worked under Craig or anywhere near Craig
[08:35.420 --> 08:37.620]  and has a single bad thing to say about the experience
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.740]  working with him.
[08:38.740 --> 08:42.860]  I mean, he seems incredibly good at his job
[08:42.860 --> 08:44.740]  and very well suited to that leadership role.
[08:44.740 --> 08:48.340]  But also, like Phil, having this incredibly deep knowledge
[08:48.340 --> 08:50.420]  of the product and the decisions.
[08:50.420 --> 08:52.780]  And to have that there, this is why
[08:52.780 --> 08:55.620]  I think this is better than having Tim for your show.
[08:55.620 --> 09:00.340]  Because not only I think you'd have a better personality
[09:00.340 --> 09:03.620]  mesh with these guys, but also I think
[09:03.620 --> 09:07.700]  Tim doesn't take that kind of deep knowledge
[09:07.700 --> 09:10.140]  of the little details of how these things are engineered
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.500]  or product decisions.
[09:11.500 --> 09:13.060]  Because I think Tim kind of knows
[09:13.060 --> 09:16.980]  he's not ahead of product the way Steve was.
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.180]  And so he has delegated that to some of the other SVPs
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.140]  in different combinations.
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.580]  And honestly, I think it's a little bit vague
[09:23.580 --> 09:24.860]  as to what the combination is right now.
[09:24.860 --> 09:26.440]  And that might be a bit of a problem.
[09:26.440 --> 09:30.940]  But overall, Tim is not really a product person.
[09:30.940 --> 09:33.540]  And Phil very clearly is.
[09:33.540 --> 09:37.180]  And honestly, from just my point of view,
[09:37.180 --> 09:39.820]  I am very happy you had those two people on.
[09:39.820 --> 09:43.180]  And I would say Phil and Craig are my favorite Apple
[09:43.180 --> 09:43.700]  executives.
[09:43.700 --> 09:48.020]  And I think the ones that most closely align
[09:48.020 --> 09:51.060]  with my priorities, it seems.
[09:51.060 --> 09:52.460]  Yeah, I think that's fair to say.
[09:52.460 --> 09:53.140]  So I don't know.
[09:53.140 --> 09:54.580]  I'm screwed for next year.
[09:54.580 --> 09:55.940]  Yeah, well, just have them on again.
[09:55.940 --> 09:56.540]  Or have moles.
[09:56.540 --> 09:56.820]  That's it.
[09:56.820 --> 09:57.820]  Those are your choices.
[09:57.820 --> 10:01.780]  I think Eddie Q, when he was on this show with Craig, was good.
[10:01.780 --> 10:06.500]  And I think he would be good, personality-wise.
[10:06.500 --> 10:11.940]  But his domain isn't a good fit, especially for the WWDC show.
[10:11.940 --> 10:16.620]  If I had something where I did a quarterly show or a twice-a-year
[10:16.620 --> 10:20.820]  show, and maybe if I did a live show after the September
[10:20.820 --> 10:22.580]  iPhone event or something like that,
[10:22.580 --> 10:24.660]  Eddie Q might be good then.
[10:24.660 --> 10:27.820]  But I feel like WWDC in particular, when the news is
[10:27.820 --> 10:30.740]  supposed to, and in late most years recently,
[10:30.740 --> 10:36.000]  really is mostly about software, it
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.940]  wouldn't really make any sense to have him on because it's not
[10:39.940 --> 10:41.660]  his domain.
[10:41.660 --> 10:42.940]  Yeah.
[10:42.940 --> 10:45.980]  I would also say one of the greatest things we saw
[10:45.980 --> 10:50.420]  at the live talk show this year is that we on the outside
[10:50.420 --> 10:53.820]  got to see, in a very, very rare circumstance,
[10:53.820 --> 10:58.300]  we got to see two Apple SVPs interacting with each other.
[10:58.300 --> 11:01.020]  And if you think about it, what other chances do we ever
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.580]  have to see that?
[11:02.580 --> 11:04.700]  And from what I understand, again,
[11:04.700 --> 11:06.860]  talking to some people inside the company,
[11:06.860 --> 11:08.780]  even most people who work in the company
[11:08.780 --> 11:11.860]  rarely see two SVPs in the same room
[11:11.860 --> 11:13.820]  because usually you're presenting to at most one
[11:13.820 --> 11:14.820]  of them.
[11:14.820 --> 11:18.440]  So to see two execs who have clearly worked together
[11:18.440 --> 11:21.140]  for a very long time and know each other really well
[11:21.140 --> 11:23.380]  and clearly respect each other very much,
[11:23.380 --> 11:25.900]  who are also good in all these other ways,
[11:25.900 --> 11:29.500]  it really brought a lot of amazing humanity and just
[11:29.500 --> 11:31.840]  insight into just who these people actually are.
[11:31.840 --> 11:33.340]  And this is something that you're not
[11:33.340 --> 11:36.100]  going to get in a carefully scripted keynote
[11:36.100 --> 11:38.900]  or any kind of carefully planned event.
[11:38.900 --> 11:41.060]  And this is why I love this show so much because you
[11:41.060 --> 11:44.980]  get to do this and you get to reveal this to the world.
[11:44.980 --> 11:49.340]  And you do it in a way that, because it's a podcast,
[11:49.340 --> 11:53.300]  I love podcasting because if you write something on a blog
[11:53.300 --> 11:55.560]  or on a news site, that spreads all over the place
[11:55.560 --> 11:56.220]  really quickly.
[11:56.220 --> 11:57.260]  If there's anything about it that's
[11:57.260 --> 11:59.480]  controversial or inflammatory or anything else, believe me,
[11:59.480 --> 12:02.140]  I know that better than a lot of people.
[12:02.140 --> 12:05.380]  And that can often be prohibitive to encouraging
[12:05.380 --> 12:07.340]  people to continue writing.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.420]  With a podcast, it seems like just
[12:09.420 --> 12:14.260]  because podcasts don't really spread like wildfire the way
[12:14.260 --> 12:17.780]  text spreads, you can quote someone's post
[12:17.780 --> 12:20.700]  or paraphrase someone's post, stick an inflammatory headline
[12:20.700 --> 12:23.060]  on it, and it just spreads like wildfire.
[12:23.060 --> 12:25.460]  Podcasts, that just doesn't happen.
[12:25.460 --> 12:29.020]  I thought last year when you had Phil on, which,
[12:29.020 --> 12:32.700]  let's anybody forget, that was remarkable at the time,
[12:32.700 --> 12:36.020]  I thought that was going to be literally world news.
[12:36.020 --> 12:38.740]  I thought it was going to be reported on CNN
[12:38.740 --> 12:40.900]  that this happened and everything that was said
[12:40.900 --> 12:44.300]  would have been scrutinized and reported on just as much
[12:44.300 --> 12:46.140]  as an Apple press release would have.
[12:46.140 --> 12:49.780]  And instead, there was one MacRumors article about it.
[12:49.780 --> 12:50.820]  It was almost nothing.
[12:50.820 --> 12:51.940]  Almost nothing happened.
[12:51.940 --> 12:53.780]  And then the same thing happened this year, where again, it's
[12:53.780 --> 12:55.620]  like now you have two Apple executives.
[12:55.620 --> 12:57.500]  Now you should have CNN and the New York Times
[12:57.500 --> 12:59.860]  reporting on it, double the coverage.
[12:59.860 --> 13:01.900]  And again, you had one MacRumors article
[13:01.900 --> 13:03.380]  and basically nothing else.
[13:03.380 --> 13:05.420]  Yeah, I thought the same thing last year.
[13:05.420 --> 13:07.540]  Not necessarily that I was disappointed.
[13:07.540 --> 13:09.460]  I was just curious.
[13:09.460 --> 13:14.580]  And I think one measure of it would be tech meme.
[13:14.580 --> 13:17.260]  And it's like I write blog posts that get more attention
[13:17.260 --> 13:20.020]  on tech meme than this.
[13:20.020 --> 13:23.900]  Well, the good thing is that I found with my experience,
[13:23.900 --> 13:27.860]  I've been writing a lot less in part because of this problem
[13:27.860 --> 13:32.620]  of just any slip up and it spreads like wildfire.
[13:32.620 --> 13:34.300]  And in podcasting, that just doesn't happen.
[13:34.300 --> 13:39.020]  But also because of that effect, and because of just
[13:39.020 --> 13:42.860]  the conversational nature of it just being more casual,
[13:42.860 --> 13:45.940]  podcasting is kind of like a safe space.
[13:45.940 --> 13:51.100]  And you can go on a podcast, you can talk off script
[13:51.100 --> 13:54.340]  and answer questions that you didn't get in advance
[13:54.340 --> 13:55.860]  or that were unplanned or whatever.
[13:55.860 --> 13:59.980]  You can accept that gig because it really isn't dangerous.
[13:59.980 --> 14:01.740]  People give you the benefit of the doubt.
[14:01.740 --> 14:03.220]  It doesn't really spread like wildfire
[14:03.220 --> 14:06.100]  if you screw something up in some kind of minor way.
[14:06.100 --> 14:08.780]  It's a conversational context, so it doesn't seem as official
[14:08.780 --> 14:11.700]  or as coded in stone.
[14:11.700 --> 14:13.820]  And I feel like, again, that's something
[14:13.820 --> 14:18.260]  that Apple never gets in any kind of public way.
[14:18.260 --> 14:22.020]  And for the listeners or the attendees of the live show,
[14:22.020 --> 14:25.660]  it's almost like being let into an exclusive club.
[14:25.660 --> 14:29.020]  It's a club of obscurity, basically.
[14:29.020 --> 14:32.420]  We get to be here and listen to this
[14:32.420 --> 14:35.540]  and get to know these people and get these great insights
[14:35.540 --> 14:39.740]  into things, but it's not a big problem for them.
[14:39.740 --> 14:42.300]  And they don't get in trouble for things they say.
[14:42.300 --> 14:44.980]  It's kind of amazing.
[14:44.980 --> 14:46.660]  I was thinking about what you said before
[14:46.660 --> 14:50.340]  about how we don't get to see Apple's executives interact
[14:50.340 --> 14:52.340]  with each other in a personal way.
[14:52.340 --> 14:55.300]  And one evidence of proof of that, and again, I often
[14:55.300 --> 14:57.780]  bring up Scott Forstall.
[14:57.780 --> 15:02.740]  And I have met him and I liked him backstage after a keynote.
[15:02.740 --> 15:05.540]  And I think he did fantastic work for the company.
[15:05.540 --> 15:08.900]  And so I bring him up not to dump on him,
[15:08.900 --> 15:11.780]  because I really think the guy did a great job.
[15:11.780 --> 15:16.380]  But famously, it did not get along well
[15:16.380 --> 15:18.060]  with the rest of the leadership team.
[15:18.060 --> 15:21.060]  I mean, the press release announcing his,
[15:21.060 --> 15:25.260]  I forget what they called it, but that he was no longer
[15:25.260 --> 15:27.140]  he was quit fired.
[15:27.140 --> 15:29.580]  Well, his promotion to, what was it,
[15:29.580 --> 15:32.820]  to Tim Cook's assistant or whatever, special advisor.
[15:32.820 --> 15:35.700]  Special advisor.
[15:35.700 --> 15:37.180]  The title of the press release was
[15:37.180 --> 15:41.500]  like something about enabling collaboration or something
[15:41.500 --> 15:42.660]  like that.
[15:42.660 --> 15:44.220]  It was very clear.
[15:44.220 --> 15:48.500]  And my sense since then, but on stage, you'd never know it.
[15:48.500 --> 15:53.780]  Like Schiller to Forstall handing off in a keynote.
[15:53.780 --> 15:56.900]  And here to tell you all about it is Senior Vice President
[15:56.900 --> 15:58.780]  Scott Forstall.
[15:58.780 --> 16:02.980]  Is exactly the same as his interaction with Federighi
[16:02.980 --> 16:04.380]  now, because they're pros.
[16:04.380 --> 16:05.220]  They're total pros.
[16:05.220 --> 16:06.020]  They're polished.
[16:06.020 --> 16:08.820]  And from the outside, you'd never
[16:08.820 --> 16:10.740]  have any idea whether there was a difference.
[16:10.740 --> 16:13.420]  Whereas on stage, with those two,
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.500]  you could tell that they like each other.
[16:15.500 --> 16:16.340]  Yeah, totally.
[16:16.340 --> 16:19.500]  Razzed each other, especially Phil Razzing Federighi.
[16:19.500 --> 16:20.740]  Oh, yeah.
[16:20.740 --> 16:22.280]  Yeah, I thought it went pretty well.
[16:22.280 --> 16:22.860]  And you know me.
[16:22.860 --> 16:25.320]  I'm not going to sit here and say how good my show was.
[16:25.320 --> 16:25.980]  Yeah, I will.
[16:25.980 --> 16:28.380]  It was really good.
[16:28.380 --> 16:28.900]  So we did.
[16:28.900 --> 16:29.380]  We did have audio.
[16:29.380 --> 16:30.380]  I love how uncomfortable this makes you.
[16:30.380 --> 16:31.100]  It does.
[16:31.100 --> 16:31.980]  It really does.
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.820]  Let's talk about the problems with the show.
[16:33.820 --> 16:34.740]  We had audio problems.
[16:34.740 --> 16:37.860]  We had this feedback at the beginning.
[16:37.860 --> 16:39.660]  And anybody who's watching the video,
[16:39.660 --> 16:42.260]  watch the video, the recorded one on Vimeo
[16:42.260 --> 16:43.500]  or listen to the podcast.
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.820]  You won't hear it.
[16:44.820 --> 16:45.540]  I don't know.
[16:45.540 --> 16:47.840]  I don't think Caleb had to clean that up.
[16:47.840 --> 16:49.260]  I don't think he had to remove it.
[16:49.260 --> 16:52.820]  I think that the audio, like the mics didn't pick it up.
[16:52.820 --> 16:54.420]  No.
[16:54.420 --> 16:56.820]  But what happened, and it wasn't Caleb's fault.
[16:56.820 --> 16:59.460]  It was during this week, and they definitely
[16:59.460 --> 17:00.420]  did a sound check.
[17:00.420 --> 17:03.900]  But Caleb let the house sound guy
[17:03.900 --> 17:06.860]  at Mezzanine, who was new, he wasn't the same guy
[17:06.860 --> 17:09.860]  as last year, talk him out of a, I don't know what,
[17:09.860 --> 17:10.660]  I don't even know.
[17:10.660 --> 17:12.620]  I didn't want to know what the details were.
[17:12.620 --> 17:14.540]  But Caleb let the guy talk him out
[17:14.540 --> 17:16.540]  of something against Caleb's better judgment.
[17:16.540 --> 17:19.140]  And then the fix, five or 10 minutes into the show,
[17:19.140 --> 17:23.060]  was exactly what Caleb wanted to do at the outset.
[17:23.060 --> 17:25.540]  It violates the number one rule of sound equipment,
[17:25.540 --> 17:28.100]  which is get it working and then don't touch anything.
[17:28.100 --> 17:29.860]  Yeah, I'm not sure where that went wrong.
[17:29.860 --> 17:31.200]  But it did get straightened out.
[17:31.200 --> 17:33.040]  And it wasn't too bad.
[17:33.040 --> 17:35.900]  It was just like, but it was just,
[17:35.900 --> 17:38.360]  if anybody watched the video and I look a little bit
[17:38.360 --> 17:43.300]  like I'm looking around, it was because of the feedback.
[17:43.300 --> 17:47.180]  But you won't hear it when you watch on the show.
[17:47.180 --> 17:49.660]  The other thing I think that I wonder how it affects
[17:49.660 --> 17:51.840]  the immediate holy shit, you know,
[17:51.840 --> 17:53.860]  these two guys are on Gruber's show,
[17:53.860 --> 17:56.740]  is that the show doesn't come out right away.
[17:56.740 --> 17:58.100]  This year it didn't come out till Friday.
[17:58.100 --> 18:00.900]  So I feel like on my list for what can I fix for next year
[18:00.900 --> 18:02.220]  is figure out who do I have to pay,
[18:02.220 --> 18:05.020]  what do I have to do to get the video out,
[18:05.020 --> 18:07.160]  hopefully like 24 hours.
[18:07.160 --> 18:09.540]  Well, on the other hand though, why?
[18:09.540 --> 18:12.580]  Like if the show doesn't make national news,
[18:12.580 --> 18:15.440]  and they don't get in trouble for anything they say,
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.220]  then that makes it easier to get them back.
[18:18.220 --> 18:21.720]  The main reason to get the turnaround quicker
[18:21.720 --> 18:24.100]  is just to make people who wanna watch it happier.
[18:24.100 --> 18:25.420]  I don't think it would have,
[18:25.420 --> 18:27.280]  I don't think it would really make a big difference
[18:27.280 --> 18:28.480]  in terms of publicity.
[18:28.480 --> 18:31.040]  The main reason is that I know,
[18:31.040 --> 18:32.720]  just from my tweets and the emails,
[18:32.720 --> 18:35.180]  that people were like chomping at the bit to get it.
[18:35.180 --> 18:36.860]  And I would be too, if there were two of me
[18:36.860 --> 18:38.660]  and one who does the show and the other one
[18:38.660 --> 18:40.860]  who just listens to the show and really likes it,
[18:40.860 --> 18:43.820]  I would have been too if I couldn't get to the live show.
[18:43.820 --> 18:44.780]  You know what you should do?
[18:44.780 --> 18:47.860]  You should hire the Apple W2C video team
[18:47.860 --> 18:49.660]  because they get stuff out the next morning.
[18:49.660 --> 18:51.220]  I know, that's amazing.
[18:51.220 --> 18:53.980]  They've really upped that.
[18:53.980 --> 18:57.260]  It's really incredible how quickly they get it out.
[18:57.260 --> 18:59.060]  The live stream broke this year.
[18:59.060 --> 19:01.380]  Last year it stayed up, but this year it broke.
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.980]  I would suggest maybe doing an audio only live stream
[19:03.980 --> 19:05.500]  because, I mean, unless you go to something
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.320]  like YouTube Live, which would also be
[19:07.320 --> 19:08.380]  probably an easier way to do it,
[19:08.380 --> 19:11.860]  but audio is a lot easier to scale up.
[19:11.860 --> 19:13.700]  And we did that two years ago
[19:13.700 --> 19:17.140]  when you and your ATP pals were the guests on the show.
[19:17.140 --> 19:18.920]  Yep, that's how I know that.
[19:18.920 --> 19:20.900]  Because we were streaming it off of my iPad
[19:20.900 --> 19:24.020]  in the back on Verizon and it was fine.
[19:25.260 --> 19:26.460]  That's absolutely true.
[19:28.660 --> 19:31.980]  The thing I love about that, I don't know if it helped you
[19:31.980 --> 19:33.680]  because then you wouldn't be nervous,
[19:33.680 --> 19:35.080]  it gave you something to do,
[19:36.100 --> 19:37.900]  or if it just made you even more nervous
[19:37.900 --> 19:39.740]  because instead of thinking about the show,
[19:39.740 --> 19:40.620]  you were fiddling with it.
[19:40.620 --> 19:42.900]  But the backstory on that was
[19:42.900 --> 19:46.220]  that literally right up until we opened the doors
[19:46.220 --> 19:48.180]  to let people in, you were back there.
[19:48.180 --> 19:49.220]  And we weren't planning it.
[19:49.220 --> 19:50.700]  You were just like, well, why don't we live stream it?
[19:50.700 --> 19:51.540]  I can do it.
[19:51.540 --> 19:52.660]  And you just took out your iPad
[19:52.660 --> 19:56.140]  and we're plugging it into the board.
[19:56.140 --> 19:57.140]  It was worse than that.
[19:57.140 --> 19:58.340]  You said, oh, by the way,
[19:58.340 --> 20:00.620]  we don't have a way to record this.
[20:00.620 --> 20:03.060]  So I was providing the only recording of it
[20:03.060 --> 20:04.540]  and also the live stream.
[20:04.540 --> 20:06.580]  Yeah, that was a poorly planned show.
[20:06.580 --> 20:08.260]  Poorly planned show.
[20:08.260 --> 20:10.460]  That's funny that we've gone from there to here
[20:10.460 --> 20:11.780]  in two years.
[20:11.780 --> 20:12.940]  I do keep pretty good notes
[20:12.940 --> 20:15.340]  about what to improve for the next year.
[20:15.340 --> 20:19.060]  No, I'd say you now have a pretty good,
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.420]  you have The Kings worked out
[20:20.420 --> 20:22.540]  and I would say just repeat this
[20:22.540 --> 20:24.380]  and maybe change the way you stream the video
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.300]  and that's about it.
[20:25.300 --> 20:26.140]  Yeah.
[20:27.520 --> 20:29.420]  Seemed like people had a good time.
[20:29.420 --> 20:30.460]  Yeah, oh yeah, it was good.
[20:30.460 --> 20:31.440]  It was a good event.
[20:31.440 --> 20:34.020]  And yeah, again, I mean,
[20:34.020 --> 20:35.320]  you won't say it, but I will.
[20:35.320 --> 20:36.160]  It was great.
[20:36.160 --> 20:39.660]  And you should definitely keep doing it if you can.
[20:39.660 --> 20:41.700]  Yeah, I'll see what I can do, hopefully.
[20:41.700 --> 20:42.860]  I thought it went well.
[20:43.940 --> 20:45.400]  How about I take a break right here
[20:45.400 --> 20:48.100]  and I thank our first sponsor.
[20:48.100 --> 20:52.440]  And our first sponsor this week is Wealthfront.
[20:52.440 --> 20:55.340]  Wealthfront is an automated investment service
[20:55.340 --> 20:59.320]  with over $3 billion in client assets under management.
[21:00.180 --> 21:02.060]  In plain English, they make it easy for anybody
[21:02.060 --> 21:03.740]  to get access to a sophisticated,
[21:03.740 --> 21:07.060]  diversified long-term investment portfolio
[21:07.060 --> 21:09.920]  without high fees and in fact, with very low fees
[21:09.920 --> 21:13.380]  and without high account minimums.
[21:13.380 --> 21:16.540]  Historically, you needed to invest at least a million bucks
[21:16.540 --> 21:18.660]  to get the attention of a quality financial advisor
[21:18.660 --> 21:20.660]  or wealth management professional
[21:20.660 --> 21:23.100]  and then you have to pay at least 1% per year
[21:23.100 --> 21:24.520]  in management fees.
[21:24.520 --> 21:25.800]  Wealthfront is nothing like that.
[21:25.800 --> 21:29.880]  They're completely free for accounts under $10,000.
[21:29.880 --> 21:32.020]  You can get started with just like a couple hundred bucks
[21:32.020 --> 21:33.620]  and in fact, they say that's how most
[21:33.620 --> 21:34.920]  of their customers start.
[21:34.920 --> 21:36.740]  They just put a couple hundred bucks in
[21:36.740 --> 21:39.900]  just to see how it works, sign up, look at the interface,
[21:39.900 --> 21:42.540]  you know, and then once they get to like it and say,
[21:42.540 --> 21:44.060]  okay, this is good, I trust this,
[21:44.060 --> 21:46.140]  then put in the quote unquote real money,
[21:46.140 --> 21:47.340]  which could be anything.
[21:48.780 --> 21:53.460]  They charge an advisory fee of just 0.25% per year
[21:53.460 --> 21:56.140]  and that's only on the assets above $10,000.
[21:56.140 --> 21:59.020]  And if you use this code, wealthfront.com slash
[21:59.020 --> 22:02.620]  the talk show, that goes to $15,000
[22:02.620 --> 22:06.180]  and you get $5,000 free management
[22:06.180 --> 22:07.620]  for every friend you invite.
[22:07.620 --> 22:10.820]  So if you like send your code to your brother-in-law
[22:10.820 --> 22:13.260]  and a couple other people, you can get, you know,
[22:13.260 --> 22:18.260]  10, 20, 25, however many extra thousand dollars
[22:18.320 --> 22:20.620]  managed for free.
[22:20.620 --> 22:24.660]  And then even then you only pay 0.25% above that
[22:24.660 --> 22:25.540]  going forward.
[22:26.740 --> 22:29.020]  They have all sorts of stuff.
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.860]  It's a long-term investment thing.
[22:30.860 --> 22:33.320]  This is like the total opposite of like day trading.
[22:33.320 --> 22:36.380]  This is a place where you put money in for the long run
[22:36.380 --> 22:38.460]  and they have so many options,
[22:38.460 --> 22:39.820]  so many different types of accounts.
[22:39.820 --> 22:42.260]  I cannot possibly go over them in the length
[22:42.260 --> 22:43.380]  of a podcast ad.
[22:43.380 --> 22:47.120]  Just go to their website and check them out.
[22:47.120 --> 22:49.320]  Really smart way to invest your money
[22:49.320 --> 22:51.380]  for the long run wealthfront
[22:51.380 --> 22:56.380]  and the URL is wealthfront.com slash the talk show.
[22:59.460 --> 23:01.180]  Anything else on the live show?
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.680]  I feel like that covers it.
[23:02.680 --> 23:03.680]  Anyway, I had a good time.
[23:03.680 --> 23:04.580]  I have not watched it.
[23:04.580 --> 23:06.100]  I can't bring myself to watch it yet.
[23:06.100 --> 23:07.580]  I watched last year's at some point,
[23:07.580 --> 23:09.820]  but I didn't watch this year's yet.
[23:09.820 --> 23:11.180]  So maybe I should have watched it
[23:11.180 --> 23:13.340]  before we started talking about it here.
[23:13.340 --> 23:14.460]  I listened to it again.
[23:16.440 --> 23:18.460]  macOS, here's my thing about macOS.
[23:18.460 --> 23:21.260]  I can't believe that they changed the name to macOS,
[23:21.260 --> 23:25.140]  but kept the 10.12 version numbering.
[23:25.140 --> 23:26.220]  What is that 10 now?
[23:26.220 --> 23:28.780]  Why is this 10 forever?
[23:28.780 --> 23:30.820]  Well, you know, I think it's a lot like, you know,
[23:30.820 --> 23:32.900]  like the dumb Windows kernel version thing
[23:32.900 --> 23:36.660]  where like, you know, Windows 2000 was like NT 5.0,
[23:36.660 --> 23:38.540]  I think, and then XP was 5.1
[23:38.540 --> 23:40.260]  and it stayed at five for a while.
[23:40.260 --> 23:42.820]  It's like, just the numbers doesn't mean anything
[23:42.820 --> 23:47.140]  relative to the marketing name and the marketing sequence.
[23:47.140 --> 23:49.100]  So I think that, you know, it just doesn't really matter.
[23:49.100 --> 23:50.840]  I'm kind of surprised though
[23:50.840 --> 23:52.620]  that they kept the California names
[23:52.620 --> 23:54.100]  and I'm kind of surprised they didn't just call this
[23:54.100 --> 23:55.160]  macOS 12.
[23:55.160 --> 23:56.580]  Like, it seemed like even though people
[23:56.580 --> 23:58.300]  would have made fun of them, oh, you skipped 11.
[23:58.300 --> 24:00.480]  Like, I think that would have made a lot more sense
[24:00.480 --> 24:01.560]  to just say, you know, all right,
[24:01.560 --> 24:03.100]  this is now macOS 12 and then next year,
[24:03.100 --> 24:05.240]  macOS 13 or whatever, but I guess those numbers
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.080]  don't scale very well.
[24:06.080 --> 24:08.900]  Nobody wants like, macOS 17, I don't know.
[24:08.900 --> 24:11.460]  It is, it does seem weird that they give,
[24:11.460 --> 24:12.620]  I think they could have done both though.
[24:12.620 --> 24:15.500]  They could have called it macOS 12 Sierra.
[24:15.500 --> 24:17.340]  Yeah, maybe, that's a lot of,
[24:17.340 --> 24:20.740]  I don't know why, why does macOS get a code name
[24:20.740 --> 24:21.840]  and iOS doesn't?
[24:21.840 --> 24:23.080]  I don't get that.
[24:23.080 --> 24:25.420]  Well, and you know, maybe because of like
[24:25.420 --> 24:26.600]  the high numbering problem, like, you know,
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.300]  once you get into like the teens, it kind of is like,
[24:28.300 --> 24:30.140]  you know, less cool sounding.
[24:30.140 --> 24:32.180]  Maybe they're going to transition iOS
[24:32.180 --> 24:34.660]  onto a code name system and maybe they would
[24:34.660 --> 24:36.220]  unify the code and maybe they would say, you know,
[24:36.220 --> 24:39.180]  this year we have iOS Sierra and macOS Sierra.
[24:39.180 --> 24:40.380]  I don't know, and there's a lot of things
[24:40.380 --> 24:42.900]  they could do there, but I do think like,
[24:42.900 --> 24:45.160]  the numbers are really nice and clean and simple now
[24:45.160 --> 24:48.180]  because they're relatively low, but once you get into like,
[24:48.180 --> 24:50.900]  you know, the teens and stuff, it's less cool.
[24:50.900 --> 24:51.740]  Yeah.
[24:53.680 --> 24:54.520]  Anything else?
[24:54.520 --> 24:55.360]  WatchOS 3.
[24:55.360 --> 24:57.820]  I love that, I love that, like, that's all we can talk about
[24:57.820 --> 24:58.820]  about macOS, the name.
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.100]  Well, have you used it yet?
[25:01.100 --> 25:05.580]  I actually have it on a MacBook Pro downstairs
[25:05.580 --> 25:10.340]  and it's like, it's exactly the sort of thing
[25:10.340 --> 25:12.460]  I would like, I'd like to see Apple do,
[25:12.460 --> 25:15.740]  which is it doesn't feel, you know,
[25:15.740 --> 25:17.660]  you could easily convince me that it wasn't even
[25:17.660 --> 25:19.580]  a new version of macOS 10 and it's like,
[25:19.580 --> 25:21.500]  oh yeah, yeah, look, that looks a little different.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.940]  They've changed a little bit here and there,
[25:22.940 --> 25:27.640]  but it is such a minor refinement in terms of everything
[25:27.640 --> 25:30.180]  I'm used to and then they've just added, you know,
[25:30.180 --> 25:31.500]  some nice new features.
[25:31.500 --> 25:32.640]  Yeah, and I'm happy with that too.
[25:32.640 --> 25:34.900]  I mean, you know, like from a developer's point of view,
[25:34.900 --> 25:38.320]  I would love to see like some modernization of AppKit
[25:38.320 --> 25:41.700]  and possibly some kind of like cross-platform AppKit UI kit
[25:41.700 --> 25:44.900]  kind of hybrid, you know, so I basically wouldn't have
[25:44.900 --> 25:49.140]  to learn AppKit, but that, you know, I understand also
[25:49.140 --> 25:52.700]  why that's kind of a big job and probably not worth doing
[25:52.700 --> 25:56.460]  necessarily or maybe waiting until like,
[25:56.460 --> 25:59.180]  presumably in the future, there's gonna be some kind of
[25:59.180 --> 26:02.760]  rewrite or refactoring of a lot of the frameworks
[26:02.760 --> 26:06.660]  to better optimize for Swift and, you know,
[26:06.660 --> 26:07.500]  beyond just renaming.
[26:07.500 --> 26:08.980]  Like right now, they've basically renamed them
[26:08.980 --> 26:10.300]  when you're using them from Swift and that's about it,
[26:10.300 --> 26:13.840]  but like there's more that you could do there
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.480]  to really optimize these things for Swift,
[26:15.480 --> 26:18.180]  so maybe down the road, they're planning on like
[26:18.180 --> 26:20.700]  a bigger change to the frameworks
[26:20.700 --> 26:21.980]  and maybe they would unify them then,
[26:21.980 --> 26:23.520]  because, you know, as you talk about it often,
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.980]  Apple's a very patient company and when it comes to like
[26:25.980 --> 26:28.100]  long-term technical decisions like this,
[26:28.100 --> 26:31.780]  they're willing to wait five, 10 years to do what they need
[26:31.780 --> 26:34.840]  to do if they think it'll be better later to do it then.
[26:34.840 --> 26:37.180]  So I think it would be interesting to see
[26:37.180 --> 26:38.660]  if they ever do tackle this problem
[26:38.660 --> 26:40.700]  or if they just kind of consider, you know,
[26:40.700 --> 26:41.980]  AppKit's the right tool for this job
[26:41.980 --> 26:43.220]  and UIKit's the right tool for that job,
[26:43.220 --> 26:45.300]  which there's some basis for that.
[26:45.300 --> 26:47.180]  Not 100%, but there's some basis for that
[26:47.180 --> 26:49.100]  and maybe they just kind of consider the Mac to be
[26:49.100 --> 26:51.380]  kind of like a completed platform,
[26:51.380 --> 26:53.620]  like we don't need to do much on this anymore.
[26:53.620 --> 26:54.500]  I don't know.
[26:54.500 --> 26:56.660]  Yeah, sort of like the way I treat Markdown.
[26:56.660 --> 26:57.500]  Yeah, right.
[26:57.500 --> 26:58.320]  I mean, no joke.
[26:58.320 --> 27:00.060]  I mean, it's seriously like, you know,
[27:00.060 --> 27:02.800]  it is what it is, you know, move on with the other stuff.
[27:02.800 --> 27:03.640]  Maybe, I don't know.
[27:03.640 --> 27:05.300]  I think you're right though that if they do do it,
[27:05.300 --> 27:07.520]  it would probably coincide with
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.260]  a swiftification of frameworks.
[27:10.260 --> 27:11.580]  Right, or, you know, if all these rumblers
[27:11.580 --> 27:12.900]  I keep hearing about there like being like
[27:12.900 --> 27:15.440]  a single unified OS coming down the road
[27:15.440 --> 27:17.380]  with new everything, you know,
[27:17.380 --> 27:19.480]  then, you know, for the car and God knows what else,
[27:19.480 --> 27:22.060]  you know, then if that is actually true
[27:22.060 --> 27:25.120]  and coming in the next five years,
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.500]  then that would be the time to do it, you know.
[27:27.500 --> 27:28.340]  Yeah, I don't know.
[27:28.340 --> 27:31.340]  I just, I don't give that rumor a lot of weight honestly
[27:31.340 --> 27:35.620]  because it seems really grand and I don't know.
[27:35.620 --> 27:37.840]  It just seems to me like when I study it
[27:37.840 --> 27:39.620]  and think about it, it's like I'm trying to think about
[27:39.620 --> 27:42.620]  what to write about the Mac OS beta.
[27:43.580 --> 27:45.940]  I keep thinking about something Guy English,
[27:45.940 --> 27:47.940]  friend of the show Guy English said to me
[27:47.940 --> 27:52.020]  last week when I was asking just friends.
[27:52.020 --> 27:53.220]  I didn't say who.
[27:53.220 --> 27:54.700]  I just said, hey, let's just say
[27:54.700 --> 27:56.740]  if I got to interview somebody, interesting.
[27:56.740 --> 27:57.660]  What are some questions?
[27:57.660 --> 27:59.940]  Do you guys have any questions that you wish I would ask?
[27:59.940 --> 28:04.260]  And Guy had pointed out that when Steve Jobs
[28:04.260 --> 28:08.580]  introduced the Mac OS 10 10.0 back in 2001,
[28:09.660 --> 28:13.220]  he framed it as saying this is the operating system
[28:13.220 --> 28:15.300]  for the next 15 years.
[28:15.300 --> 28:16.920]  That was 15 years ago.
[28:16.920 --> 28:21.100]  Yep, and I think it's almost,
[28:21.100 --> 28:23.080]  he was trying to say this is the operating system
[28:23.080 --> 28:25.700]  for the long term for Apple.
[28:25.700 --> 28:27.540]  This is something that Apple can really,
[28:27.540 --> 28:29.960]  so what, Apple was, what, they're 40 years old now,
[28:29.960 --> 28:31.960]  so they were a 25-year-old company then.
[28:34.860 --> 28:38.880]  It was as far away from the original Mac as we are today.
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.140]  I think, if anything, in hindsight,
[28:41.140 --> 28:44.500]  Jobs clearly undersold the longevity of the platform
[28:44.500 --> 28:45.500]  because that's the thing I look at
[28:45.500 --> 28:47.020]  when I look at Mac OS 10.12,
[28:47.020 --> 28:48.820]  is that this doesn't feel like an operating system
[28:48.820 --> 28:49.660]  on its last legs.
[28:49.660 --> 28:51.180]  This feels like an operating system
[28:51.180 --> 28:53.220]  that is still in its prime
[28:53.220 --> 28:55.900]  and doing, it's exactly what it wants to be
[28:55.900 --> 28:59.260]  and really doesn't need anything major.
[28:59.260 --> 29:01.020]  I mean, it could, and it someday,
[29:01.020 --> 29:03.340]  something like your example
[29:03.340 --> 29:08.340]  about doing a lot of UI kitification to AppKit
[29:08.580 --> 29:11.500]  or bringing UI kit to Mac OS 10 in some way
[29:11.500 --> 29:14.900]  to sit there alongside AppKit or who knows?
[29:14.900 --> 29:15.980]  Major changes someday,
[29:15.980 --> 29:18.220]  but at the moment, it's really just fine
[29:18.220 --> 29:20.180]  and does its job very well.
[29:20.180 --> 29:21.940]  And the way I put it a couple years ago,
[29:21.940 --> 29:22.780]  and it's funny too,
[29:22.780 --> 29:25.780]  because I said something about the next five years,
[29:25.780 --> 29:27.640]  but it was like five years ago,
[29:27.640 --> 29:31.280]  so I undersold it as much five years ago as Jobs did, 15,
[29:31.280 --> 29:35.460]  was that the heaviness of the Mac, conceptually,
[29:35.460 --> 29:38.500]  that it's so, you can have so many windows open
[29:38.500 --> 29:40.500]  and you can go so deep and you have all these options
[29:40.500 --> 29:43.500]  like services and control, right-clicking
[29:43.500 --> 29:45.140]  and getting these contextual menus
[29:45.140 --> 29:47.700]  and even just the existence of the menu bar,
[29:48.820 --> 29:52.660]  that heaviness is what lets iOS remain so lightweight
[29:54.020 --> 29:55.620]  that you couldn't have it like the iPad
[29:55.620 --> 29:57.220]  and make it as simple as it is
[29:58.240 --> 30:00.180]  without having a platform to go with it
[30:00.180 --> 30:02.100]  that is as complicated as the Mac.
[30:03.420 --> 30:06.660]  I mean, the downside of that kind of, of that logic though,
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.100]  which I think is mostly sound,
[30:08.100 --> 30:11.100]  but the downside of that is like that kind of assumes
[30:11.100 --> 30:14.900]  that they will be both maintained over time
[30:14.900 --> 30:16.940]  and will both succeed over time,
[30:16.940 --> 30:20.060]  and I'm not sure that's a safe assumption to make.
[30:20.060 --> 30:22.500]  I wonder if it doesn't also, conversely,
[30:22.500 --> 30:27.500]  tie into the fact that there's some productivity tasks
[30:28.860 --> 30:31.420]  that just still aren't that great to do on an iPad.
[30:32.420 --> 30:34.780]  You know, that it works both ways,
[30:34.780 --> 30:38.140]  that it's like they just haven't been,
[30:38.140 --> 30:40.700]  they haven't felt forced to enable the iPad
[30:40.700 --> 30:42.180]  to be good at X,
[30:42.180 --> 30:45.020]  because yeah, you could just use your MacBook for that.
[30:45.020 --> 30:45.940]  Well, but also like, you know,
[30:45.940 --> 30:50.840]  as they have added more productivity features to iOS
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.220]  and especially to the iPad,
[30:52.220 --> 30:53.300]  you're kind of seeing them
[30:53.300 --> 30:55.280]  basically try to address the same problems,
[30:55.280 --> 30:57.100]  like basically trying to make it closer
[30:57.100 --> 30:58.180]  to a Mac kind of environment.
[30:58.180 --> 31:01.580]  So now you have things like a basic form of windowing
[31:01.580 --> 31:02.980]  and multiple windows on screen.
[31:02.980 --> 31:05.300]  You know, you have these document pickers
[31:05.300 --> 31:07.980]  that are a simplified view of a file system
[31:07.980 --> 31:09.460]  that are still files, you know?
[31:09.460 --> 31:14.180]  Like they're having to solve the same problems
[31:14.180 --> 31:16.680]  and oftentimes the solutions they come up with
[31:16.680 --> 31:18.840]  are actually not substantially better
[31:18.840 --> 31:21.740]  than the solutions that the PC and Mac world
[31:21.740 --> 31:23.500]  figured out years ago.
[31:23.500 --> 31:24.340]  Sometimes they are,
[31:24.340 --> 31:27.660]  but it seems like they're both kind of aiming
[31:27.660 --> 31:30.260]  for the same thing where they try to make Mac OS
[31:30.260 --> 31:34.940]  easier to use and more iOS-like in ways.
[31:34.940 --> 31:37.560]  At the same time, they're trying to make iOS more productive
[31:37.560 --> 31:39.540]  and more suited for pro use.
[31:39.540 --> 31:42.000]  And by doing that, they're kind of making iOS
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.020]  a little more Mac-like in these certain areas.
[31:44.020 --> 31:47.580]  And I'm not sure either effort
[31:47.580 --> 31:49.580]  is a huge success necessarily.
[31:49.580 --> 31:54.300]  I think the effort to proify iOS
[31:54.300 --> 31:56.140]  is probably more successful than the effort
[31:56.140 --> 31:58.280]  to iOS-ify the Mac.
[31:58.280 --> 31:59.580]  I think that if you think about it,
[31:59.580 --> 32:00.980]  I can't think of anything this year
[32:00.980 --> 32:03.620]  that really was iOS-ification of the Mac.
[32:03.620 --> 32:05.880]  I feel like maybe they're done with that
[32:05.880 --> 32:08.980]  and they've done enough of it that they wanted to
[32:08.980 --> 32:10.640]  and now they're just letting the Mac be the Mac.
[32:10.640 --> 32:13.400]  I mean, maybe I'm overlooking something,
[32:13.400 --> 32:15.420]  but I can't think of anything.
[32:15.420 --> 32:16.380]  No, you might be right.
[32:16.380 --> 32:20.540]  I mean, maybe it does seem like they've kind of figured out
[32:20.540 --> 32:22.620]  that the Mac doesn't need to be iOS,
[32:22.620 --> 32:24.060]  that it can stand on its own.
[32:24.060 --> 32:26.620]  Maybe they've gained more confidence in it
[32:26.620 --> 32:27.780]  as being its own thing.
[32:29.020 --> 32:30.060]  Yeah, I can't think of anything.
[32:30.060 --> 32:31.740]  I mean, there are features that are obviously
[32:31.740 --> 32:34.700]  in parallel with iOS,
[32:34.700 --> 32:37.260]  like the fancy new messages, animations,
[32:37.260 --> 32:38.980]  and stuff like that,
[32:38.980 --> 32:40.840]  but that's not really iOS-ifying the Mac.
[32:40.840 --> 32:43.620]  That's just getting the same stuff at the same time.
[32:43.620 --> 32:47.020]  Yeah, but ultimately, in the long haul,
[32:47.020 --> 32:50.480]  I think having iOS be this juggernaut
[32:50.480 --> 32:52.980]  that is most of the market for Apple,
[32:53.860 --> 32:54.980]  it will hurt the Mac.
[32:54.980 --> 32:57.360]  It will cost the Mac because you have situations,
[32:57.360 --> 32:59.400]  like messages apps are a great example of this,
[32:59.400 --> 33:02.660]  where you can now have,
[33:02.660 --> 33:07.340]  until iOS 10, iMessage worked basically the same way
[33:07.340 --> 33:10.300]  on all three platforms, iPad, iPhone, Mac.
[33:10.300 --> 33:11.140]  It worked the same way.
[33:11.140 --> 33:13.160]  It had the same capabilities, roughly.
[33:13.160 --> 33:14.940]  With the new version of messages,
[33:14.940 --> 33:17.740]  now you're gonna have this large amount of functionality,
[33:17.740 --> 33:19.380]  especially if the app thing takes off,
[33:19.380 --> 33:22.620]  which other messages services have had apps
[33:22.620 --> 33:24.740]  that have taken off, so they probably will,
[33:24.740 --> 33:27.940]  and Apple's pretty good at apps and making apps take off,
[33:27.940 --> 33:29.540]  as long as you aren't talking about the TV.
[33:29.540 --> 33:33.580]  So by having this big app environment
[33:33.580 --> 33:35.260]  that's going to take off on iOS,
[33:35.260 --> 33:38.460]  and having almost none of it available on the Mac,
[33:38.460 --> 33:42.220]  and having no easy technical bridge there,
[33:42.220 --> 33:46.180]  because the Mac is not UIKit and is not iOS,
[33:46.180 --> 33:47.860]  and is not running all these same frameworks,
[33:47.860 --> 33:50.060]  and does not have the same kind of extension system
[33:50.060 --> 33:52.040]  and binary support and everything else,
[33:52.040 --> 33:54.900]  I suspect that the Mac is gonna have some trouble
[33:54.900 --> 33:57.080]  in the next few years, if this stuff takes off,
[33:57.080 --> 33:59.820]  because it's going to feel even more like
[33:59.820 --> 34:02.160]  a second-class citizen than it does now.
[34:04.340 --> 34:05.700]  I don't know, maybe.
[34:05.700 --> 34:07.300]  I mean, and that does tie in.
[34:07.300 --> 34:10.300]  This is a good segue, I think, because it does tie in to,
[34:10.300 --> 34:12.540]  I can't believe I almost forgot to bring this up,
[34:12.540 --> 34:16.580]  is I have one major regret from the live show.
[34:16.580 --> 34:18.860]  There was one question from my list.
[34:18.860 --> 34:20.460]  Like I said, there were a bunch that I didn't get to
[34:20.460 --> 34:21.860]  that were fine, that were just sort of like,
[34:21.860 --> 34:23.460]  hey, if we have time, I'll get to these, and if not,
[34:23.460 --> 34:26.060]  but there was one that I had above the line
[34:26.060 --> 34:30.080]  of definitely want to ask that I didn't get to,
[34:30.080 --> 34:32.220]  and it was on the tip of my tongue at one point,
[34:32.220 --> 34:35.260]  but it didn't seem like the right moment,
[34:35.260 --> 34:37.320]  and then after that, it was like out of my mind,
[34:37.320 --> 34:39.460]  and I'd forgotten it, and the question
[34:39.460 --> 34:41.660]  would have been for Phil, and it would have been
[34:41.660 --> 34:45.500]  more or less along the lines of the Mac Pro
[34:45.500 --> 34:47.720]  hasn't been updated in over 900 days.
[34:47.720 --> 34:50.540]  I think as of the showtime, it was 908 days,
[34:50.540 --> 34:53.260]  and the Mac Mini hasn't been updated in over 600 days,
[34:53.260 --> 34:57.700]  and why do you hate pro-customers?
[35:00.700 --> 35:05.700]  And but it, you know, insert audience laughter there,
[35:06.040 --> 35:08.060]  but the true thing is I know for a fact,
[35:08.060 --> 35:12.960]  talking to developer friends and just reading email
[35:12.960 --> 35:17.200]  from DF, the Daring Fireball audience,
[35:17.200 --> 35:19.560]  which has, in addition to developers,
[35:19.560 --> 35:22.040]  I definitely have a lot of readers and listeners
[35:22.040 --> 35:24.140]  who are professionals in video and photography
[35:24.140 --> 35:27.420]  and other things where they want a new Mac Pro,
[35:27.420 --> 35:30.400]  and the concern is palpable that they worry
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.400]  that Apple's phenomenal success selling consumer products
[35:37.180 --> 35:41.600]  has left them disinterested in professional products.
[35:41.600 --> 35:43.260]  Yeah, and I think that concern is warranted
[35:43.260 --> 35:44.700]  based on a lot of the stuff that's happened
[35:44.700 --> 35:46.100]  over the last few years, like a lot of,
[35:46.100 --> 35:48.420]  yeah, I mean, first of all, losing things like Aperture
[35:48.420 --> 35:52.020]  and then seeing even the Final Cut transition
[35:52.020 --> 35:54.620]  to Final Cut, now is that one X or 10?
[35:55.940 --> 35:56.780]  I honestly don't know.
[35:56.780 --> 35:57.780]  I don't know.
[35:57.780 --> 35:58.620]  I'm gonna say 10.
[35:58.620 --> 35:59.540]  I'm gonna guess 10.
[36:00.540 --> 36:02.100]  That, I know, you know, a lot of pros
[36:02.100 --> 36:04.860]  are still sore about that, and from what I understand,
[36:04.860 --> 36:05.840]  that's mostly been kinda, you know,
[36:05.840 --> 36:08.320]  people now are okay with it, but like, you know,
[36:08.320 --> 36:10.400]  the software side, Apple has definitely backed away
[36:10.400 --> 36:12.940]  from the pro market to a large degree.
[36:12.940 --> 36:16.100]  The hardware side, I think it's been even more dramatic,
[36:16.100 --> 36:19.540]  and granted, a lot of pros get away just fine with iMacs.
[36:19.540 --> 36:21.200]  A lot of pros use the MacBook Pro,
[36:21.200 --> 36:22.880]  and they're mostly fine with that, too,
[36:22.880 --> 36:24.840]  although it's pretty old.
[36:24.840 --> 36:26.880]  I think one of the problems we have now,
[36:26.880 --> 36:29.980]  and which ties into the Thunderbolt display thing also,
[36:29.980 --> 36:33.020]  but one of the problems we have now is that
[36:33.020 --> 36:35.940]  it seems like Apple has, you know,
[36:35.940 --> 36:38.420]  whoever is responsible for deciding these,
[36:38.420 --> 36:40.620]  like, you know, these hardware generations
[36:40.620 --> 36:42.860]  and when to ship things and what makes the cut
[36:42.860 --> 36:45.420]  and what gets pushed to the next release,
[36:45.420 --> 36:50.420]  it seems like their sensibility for do we ship now
[36:50.420 --> 36:53.020]  with the new stuff we've accumulated so far,
[36:53.020 --> 36:56.880]  or do we wait and do a bigger update in X time
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.980]  with the stuff that's imminent, that we're soon,
[36:59.980 --> 37:02.420]  if we wait now, we'll be able to do a bigger update
[37:02.420 --> 37:04.920]  in six months that has X, Y, and Z.
[37:04.920 --> 37:08.020]  And it seems like their sensibility for that
[37:08.020 --> 37:09.980]  is just a little bit off in recent years.
[37:09.980 --> 37:12.380]  That, because like, there are new components
[37:12.380 --> 37:14.420]  they could have used for the Mac Pro.
[37:14.420 --> 37:16.460]  And, you know, the Mac Pro uses Xeon CPUs,
[37:16.460 --> 37:17.500]  Intel's server line.
[37:17.500 --> 37:19.380]  Xeons don't get released that often.
[37:19.380 --> 37:21.360]  They get released, I think, roughly every 18 months.
[37:21.360 --> 37:22.580]  There's like a new generation of Xeons
[37:22.580 --> 37:25.420]  that would be suitable to use in the Mac Pro.
[37:25.420 --> 37:28.380]  GPUs get released even more often than that.
[37:28.380 --> 37:31.900]  And for Apple to say that this is a,
[37:31.900 --> 37:34.000]  like, you know, they've redesigned this entire machine
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.980]  to be entirely like GPU focused,
[37:36.980 --> 37:40.220]  that you can't even buy this with only one GPU anymore.
[37:40.220 --> 37:42.220]  You can only get it with two GPUs
[37:42.220 --> 37:44.680]  and they're gonna be server-ish
[37:44.680 --> 37:46.580]  or workstation-ish grade GPUs.
[37:46.580 --> 37:47.580]  There's some asterisks on that,
[37:47.580 --> 37:49.860]  but basically they're gonna be workstation GPUs.
[37:49.860 --> 37:52.940]  And, you know, this is the future
[37:52.940 --> 37:54.620]  of how we see Pro computing
[37:54.620 --> 37:57.780]  is these heavy GPU operating machines.
[37:57.780 --> 38:00.020]  Well, the GPU world moves really quickly,
[38:00.020 --> 38:02.380]  way faster than the CPU world ever did.
[38:02.380 --> 38:04.220]  And it's still moving at that speed.
[38:04.220 --> 38:07.380]  You can't say your vision for Pro computing
[38:07.380 --> 38:11.060]  is tons of GPU power and then not update the GPUs
[38:11.060 --> 38:13.220]  that you're selling for three years.
[38:13.220 --> 38:16.300]  Like, it seems like they set on this course of,
[38:16.300 --> 38:17.940]  we're gonna, you know, this is our vision
[38:17.940 --> 38:18.780]  of the future of computing,
[38:18.780 --> 38:21.020]  and then they just didn't follow through at all.
[38:21.020 --> 38:24.620]  And to the point now where, you know,
[38:24.620 --> 38:26.100]  a year in, it was kind of like,
[38:26.100 --> 38:28.260]  eh, I wish these GPUs were faster.
[38:28.260 --> 38:30.860]  Two years in, it was like, ah, is everything okay?
[38:30.860 --> 38:32.840]  Three years in, people are looking for the exits
[38:32.840 --> 38:35.020]  and looking to switch to Windows for their Pro needs.
[38:35.020 --> 38:36.100]  And that's a problem.
[38:36.100 --> 38:37.900]  It definitely is because,
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.160]  and I think that in an ideal world,
[38:42.160 --> 38:43.020]  well, maybe not ideal,
[38:43.020 --> 38:44.840]  because ideal, it would be updated very,
[38:44.840 --> 38:46.340]  you know, we'd see lots of updates.
[38:46.340 --> 38:49.120]  I would say in a realistically ideal world,
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.120]  the Mac Pro could still be on a greater than one year cycle.
[38:54.460 --> 38:56.460]  I think, you know, it could,
[38:56.460 --> 38:58.660]  like 18 months, though, is about the upper limit
[38:58.660 --> 39:00.260]  of some kind of update.
[39:00.260 --> 39:02.220]  And fortunately, that's about as often
[39:02.220 --> 39:03.620]  as Intel makes new Xeons.
[39:03.620 --> 39:06.980]  So all Apple has to do is stop skipping generations.
[39:06.980 --> 39:10.400]  Because right now, like, in recent times at the Mac Pro,
[39:10.400 --> 39:12.540]  for maybe the last, I don't know, six, seven years,
[39:12.540 --> 39:17.500]  they've released roughly every other Xeon generation.
[39:17.500 --> 39:19.100]  Like, they just kinda skip every other one.
[39:19.100 --> 39:21.260]  And I don't, you know, I'm sure there,
[39:21.260 --> 39:22.540]  maybe there's good reasons why,
[39:22.540 --> 39:24.260]  but I'm not aware of what those are.
[39:24.260 --> 39:26.180]  And it appears from the outside,
[39:26.180 --> 39:27.820]  like, they just don't feel like it.
[39:27.820 --> 39:29.820]  And that's not a good reason, if that's the reason.
[39:29.820 --> 39:32.940]  And again, even if, for some reason,
[39:32.940 --> 39:35.040]  you have to keep the same CPUs,
[39:35.040 --> 39:38.060]  if this computer's really gonna be a GPU-focused machine,
[39:38.060 --> 39:39.420]  release new GPUs for it.
[39:39.420 --> 39:41.540]  And by the way, this is a Pro machine,
[39:41.540 --> 39:44.380]  make those GPUs upgradable.
[39:44.380 --> 39:47.460]  Because that's what Pros who need a lot of GPUs need.
[39:47.460 --> 39:51.300]  They need upgradable, powerful, recent GPUs.
[39:51.300 --> 39:53.220]  And if that's not the focus of the machine,
[39:53.220 --> 39:57.760]  then make it cheaper by making a single GPU option,
[39:57.760 --> 39:59.140]  and give more CPU options.
[39:59.140 --> 40:01.780]  Maybe redesign it so it can support two sockets again.
[40:01.780 --> 40:04.180]  Then you can have then, like, you know,
[40:04.180 --> 40:06.300]  double the amount of very high-speed cores,
[40:06.300 --> 40:08.540]  double the number of RAM slots, like,
[40:08.540 --> 40:11.980]  it's like, they designed this machine to accomplish a goal
[40:11.980 --> 40:14.020]  that they are seemingly unable or unwilling
[40:14.020 --> 40:15.160]  to actually fulfill.
[40:17.540 --> 40:21.540]  It's just funny, because it's a striking design.
[40:21.540 --> 40:26.500]  And obviously, it wasn't designed as a second thought.
[40:26.500 --> 40:29.760]  It was designed as, let's redefine what it means
[40:29.760 --> 40:34.760]  to make a kick-ass, professional, high-performance desktop.
[40:34.760 --> 40:39.040]  But then it was, again, it's almost like they figured,
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.080]  well, we're done, we came up with a new Mac Pro,
[40:42.080 --> 40:45.000]  and now we're done, let's work on the iPhone 6s.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.240]  Yeah, and it's sad, because it does seem like,
[40:48.240 --> 40:51.920]  from the outside, having no answers from Apple on this,
[40:51.920 --> 40:53.920]  it does seem like they just don't care.
[40:53.920 --> 40:57.360]  And the whole Mac lineup kind of looks like that right now,
[40:57.360 --> 40:59.160]  or at least the vast majority of it.
[40:59.160 --> 41:01.940]  And it's, you know, I know they do care,
[41:01.940 --> 41:04.440]  like, I know that's not actually the case,
[41:04.440 --> 41:05.880]  but it sure looks bad.
[41:05.880 --> 41:07.960]  It does, and it definitely doesn't.
[41:07.960 --> 41:09.360]  And maybe it's not even entirely rational.
[41:09.360 --> 41:11.400]  I think people's professionals' concerns
[41:11.400 --> 41:13.720]  about Apple's long-term interest in this,
[41:13.720 --> 41:16.260]  it's just that if your personal livelihood
[41:16.260 --> 41:19.800]  is based on what you do at your computer,
[41:19.800 --> 41:21.800]  and that's probably true, it's certainly true for me and you
[41:21.800 --> 41:23.580]  and it's true for a lot of people who listen,
[41:23.580 --> 41:27.140]  I think, to this show, it's reasonable to be concerned
[41:27.140 --> 41:30.120]  that the only company that makes the tools that you use
[41:30.120 --> 41:32.440]  may not be interested in serving you anymore.
[41:32.440 --> 41:34.960]  Right, because one thing pro users hate,
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.240]  with very good reason, is being forced to change
[41:38.240 --> 41:39.400]  what they use to do their job,
[41:39.400 --> 41:40.560]  either their workflow, their hardware,
[41:40.560 --> 41:41.680]  their software, whatever.
[41:41.680 --> 41:43.760]  They hate doing that because it sucks,
[41:43.760 --> 41:46.080]  because when you're using something to get your work done,
[41:46.080 --> 41:48.460]  you don't want to have to spend a bunch of time and money
[41:48.460 --> 41:51.100]  to change systems, to relearn something else,
[41:51.100 --> 41:53.460]  to update everything and fix everything that breaks
[41:53.460 --> 41:55.640]  and deal with missing functionality for a while
[41:55.640 --> 41:58.440]  or have to buy new hardware, buy new software.
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.560]  It's very disruptive to pros to have their platform
[42:02.560 --> 42:05.120]  and their workflow messed with or be forced to change it.
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.380]  So when you're buying something for pro use,
[42:07.380 --> 42:09.040]  you want to be buying into a system
[42:09.040 --> 42:11.080]  that's going to be stable long term.
[42:11.080 --> 42:13.900]  You don't want to have to be learning an app now
[42:13.900 --> 42:16.020]  that is going to be discontinued next year,
[42:16.020 --> 42:18.240]  and oh, by the way, you have to also switch to Windows
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.680]  if you want to be competitive with your video encoding rig
[42:20.680 --> 42:22.800]  or whatever, like, nobody wants that,
[42:22.800 --> 42:26.040]  and it kind of feels like this is going to be like
[42:26.040 --> 42:31.040]  a downward spiral where Apple will keep really neglecting
[42:31.200 --> 42:35.040]  the pro hardware, which will then make people trust it less
[42:35.040 --> 42:36.620]  and they won't sell as many,
[42:36.620 --> 42:39.160]  and then Apple can justify discontinuing those
[42:39.160 --> 42:40.840]  or neglecting them further, because then they can say,
[42:40.840 --> 42:42.120]  well, we just don't sell very many of these,
[42:42.120 --> 42:43.240]  so why should we pay attention to these?
[42:43.240 --> 42:47.320]  Yeah, it's, you know, I feel like it doesn't take a genius
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.640]  to analyze the situation, where the Mac is the pro platform
[42:51.640 --> 42:54.800]  and iOS is the consumer platform,
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.640]  and especially with the iPhone, that's where the,
[42:59.640 --> 43:02.640]  you know, there's, what, I don't know,
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.260]  20-fold, 30-fold more of them sold per quarter
[43:07.680 --> 43:08.640]  all around the world.
[43:08.640 --> 43:11.760]  It's their expansion into all these other countries
[43:11.760 --> 43:14.300]  like India and especially China,
[43:15.320 --> 43:19.640]  so of course, of course it's their most important priority.
[43:19.640 --> 43:22.880]  Of course they're never going to be late on an iPhone,
[43:22.880 --> 43:24.880]  or if they are, it's a catastrophe,
[43:24.880 --> 43:27.440]  not as a result of, eh, we can wait.
[43:28.440 --> 43:30.980]  Like imagine if the iPhone didn't get updated for 900 days.
[43:30.980 --> 43:32.760]  You can't, I mean, literally,
[43:32.760 --> 43:34.880]  I know people make these jokes that, you know,
[43:34.880 --> 43:36.920]  the stock's down 10%, Tim Cook should be fired,
[43:36.920 --> 43:38.120]  or I shouldn't even say they make jokes.
[43:38.120 --> 43:40.160]  I know there's jackasses who actually say that.
[43:40.160 --> 43:41.040]  They're serious.
[43:43.640 --> 43:46.880]  But with no hyperbole, if Apple went,
[43:46.880 --> 43:50.920]  got even close to that, if Apple went, you know,
[43:50.920 --> 43:52.340]  two years without an iPhone update,
[43:52.340 --> 43:54.480]  I think it would be reasonable for the board
[43:54.480 --> 43:57.000]  to maybe call Tim Cook in and say it's time, you know,
[43:57.000 --> 43:57.840]  you're out.
[43:57.840 --> 44:00.340]  Yeah, that would be cause for serious concern.
[44:00.340 --> 44:01.960]  Right, it's like you can't even,
[44:01.960 --> 44:04.080]  really it's unfathomable, you know.
[44:04.080 --> 44:06.440]  So 900 days for the Mac Pro is, you know,
[44:06.440 --> 44:08.100]  it's not gonna get anybody fired,
[44:08.100 --> 44:09.120]  but it certainly looks bad.
[44:09.120 --> 44:10.600]  And I can even see it with the Mac Mini,
[44:10.600 --> 44:12.720]  where the Mac Mini's never been updated quickly,
[44:12.720 --> 44:14.960]  and maybe that's not really a pro machine,
[44:14.960 --> 44:16.720]  although I do know that there are some people
[44:16.720 --> 44:19.620]  who use it in pro sort of ways by like, you know,
[44:19.620 --> 44:22.680]  setting up like build machines and stuff like that.
[44:22.680 --> 44:24.560]  Yeah, or like servers for offices,
[44:24.560 --> 44:25.840]  or even web servers in some cases.
[44:25.840 --> 44:28.800]  Right, and I, you know, my friend Brian Stuckey,
[44:28.800 --> 44:33.800]  formerly of Mac Mini, colo, and now at Mac Stadium
[44:33.940 --> 44:35.120]  is the new company that he combined with.
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.760]  Yeah, they bought them, right, yeah.
[44:36.760 --> 44:38.200]  Yeah, well they like merged.
[44:39.360 --> 44:41.640]  And he even, I know he sent me like,
[44:41.640 --> 44:43.760]  hey, please ask, if you get any,
[44:43.760 --> 44:45.000]  I don't know who you've got on the talk show,
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.100]  but if you get anybody good,
[44:46.100 --> 44:49.640]  can you please ask them about my poor Mac Mini?
[44:49.640 --> 44:52.300]  So there is a pro angle on the Mac Mini.
[44:52.300 --> 44:53.780]  Yeah, but also it's worth pointing out too,
[44:53.780 --> 44:56.420]  like the current generation Mac Mini,
[44:56.420 --> 44:58.680]  and the current generation Mac Pro,
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.680]  both do a lot less than their previous hardware designs.
[45:03.920 --> 45:05.120]  So like they've taken these products,
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.440]  and not only have they made them,
[45:07.440 --> 45:08.480]  you know, in the case of the Mac Pro,
[45:08.480 --> 45:09.680]  it's actually more expensive now,
[45:09.680 --> 45:11.240]  because now you have to pay for two GPUs.
[45:11.240 --> 45:12.960]  So now it's more expensive,
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.880]  and it has less flexibility, and less upgradability,
[45:16.880 --> 45:19.120]  and fewer configuration options,
[45:19.120 --> 45:20.360]  and less stuff you can put into it,
[45:20.360 --> 45:22.440]  less maximum capacities in a lot of areas.
[45:23.400 --> 45:24.240]  And the Mac Mini too,
[45:24.240 --> 45:26.380]  the Mac Mini used to have a quad core option,
[45:26.380 --> 45:29.240]  and it was a really great way to get a decent amount
[45:29.240 --> 45:31.680]  of power in this little headless server.
[45:31.680 --> 45:34.920]  And occasionally they go up for sale
[45:34.920 --> 45:36.920]  on the Apple refurb store,
[45:36.920 --> 45:40.000]  and they just disappear in like a minute.
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.080]  Like there is still incredible demand
[45:43.080 --> 45:46.120]  for I believe it was a 2012 era CPU
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.880]  in these roughly 2012 era Mac Minis,
[45:48.880 --> 45:50.840]  because they happen to be quad core,
[45:50.840 --> 45:53.760]  and that's a lot more processing power in total,
[45:53.760 --> 45:57.280]  in parallel, than the current model's
[45:57.280 --> 45:59.600]  dual core highest configuration.
[45:59.600 --> 46:01.160]  Yeah, and a lot of what people want to do
[46:01.160 --> 46:02.960]  is these things that are paralyzable.
[46:02.960 --> 46:04.060]  Right, especially in a server.
[46:04.060 --> 46:06.260]  So like, or you know, even if you're using it at home,
[46:06.260 --> 46:08.560]  like for like a media thing for your TV,
[46:08.560 --> 46:09.960]  or if you're using it as a build server,
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.680]  all those things use all the cores.
[46:11.680 --> 46:14.480]  So like, almost everything that like a pro
[46:14.480 --> 46:16.480]  would want to do with it is parallel.
[46:16.480 --> 46:18.240]  And you know, even for home users,
[46:18.240 --> 46:19.960]  like at least make the option.
[46:19.960 --> 46:22.280]  So Apple has these machines now
[46:22.280 --> 46:25.000]  where they're actually making them worse,
[46:25.000 --> 46:28.440]  and in some cases worse and more expensive over time,
[46:28.440 --> 46:30.960]  and updating them almost never.
[46:31.900 --> 46:34.100]  And then so of course sales are gonna go down,
[46:34.100 --> 46:36.240]  which again, it's gonna make that downward spiral start,
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.180]  where then they won't be able to justify updating them.
[46:39.180 --> 46:40.520]  And it's just gonna get worse.
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.560]  And I feel like, you know, and we're gonna get to this,
[46:43.560 --> 46:44.980]  I think if we ever get to the headphone jack,
[46:44.980 --> 46:47.200]  and you probably shouldn't let us get to that,
[46:47.200 --> 46:49.240]  because I have a lot to say about that.
[46:49.240 --> 46:53.440]  But it seems like Apple, somewhere in Apple
[46:53.440 --> 46:56.240]  there's like this obsession with getting rid of things,
[46:56.240 --> 46:57.840]  getting rid of options, getting rid of ports,
[46:57.840 --> 47:01.000]  getting rid of hardware, getting rid of something,
[47:01.000 --> 47:03.080]  you know, just getting rid of things.
[47:03.080 --> 47:05.320]  And I can see how you get that way.
[47:05.320 --> 47:07.420]  I've gotten that way before in my software development,
[47:07.420 --> 47:10.480]  where like, it feels really good to get rid of stuff.
[47:10.480 --> 47:13.200]  And oftentimes there are benefits.
[47:13.200 --> 47:15.680]  But not always, it isn't always worth it.
[47:15.680 --> 47:18.340]  And sometimes the costs outweigh the benefits.
[47:18.340 --> 47:20.140]  And it seems like, you know, similar to how like
[47:20.140 --> 47:23.580]  I question the decision making that has led to like,
[47:23.580 --> 47:26.440]  oh, we'll just wait until thing in the near future
[47:26.440 --> 47:28.360]  to update this computer.
[47:28.360 --> 47:30.920]  I also question the judgment recently of,
[47:30.920 --> 47:31.980]  oh, we can just take this out,
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.180]  or we can just make this worse,
[47:33.180 --> 47:35.260]  or we can just make this more expensive or whatever,
[47:35.260 --> 47:36.560]  and it'll be worth it in the end,
[47:36.560 --> 47:37.780]  because we're moving forward.
[47:37.780 --> 47:39.860]  It's the future, the vision of the future
[47:39.860 --> 47:41.300]  is things can do less and cost more.
[47:41.300 --> 47:44.400]  Like, no, that's, but that's actually what we're seeing
[47:44.400 --> 47:47.000]  in some of these products, and that does concern me.
[47:50.200 --> 47:52.520]  I think so, too, it would have been interesting to ask,
[47:52.520 --> 47:54.560]  so I regret not asking that question.
[47:54.560 --> 47:56.680]  I don't know how we could have gone that long on stage
[47:56.680 --> 47:57.600]  with it, but probably not.
[47:57.600 --> 47:58.440]  I would have been interested in hearing this.
[47:58.440 --> 48:00.360]  Maybe better that you didn't.
[48:00.360 --> 48:03.860]  There were, prior to WWDC, up until a couple of weeks,
[48:03.860 --> 48:05.200]  there were a lot of expectations
[48:05.200 --> 48:06.640]  that there might be hardware announcements,
[48:06.640 --> 48:07.920]  and if there would, Mac.
[48:07.920 --> 48:10.540]  People were thinking maybe new MacBooks,
[48:10.540 --> 48:11.520]  maybe a new Mac Pro.
[48:11.520 --> 48:13.860]  I don't really think the new Mac Pro
[48:13.860 --> 48:16.380]  ever really heated up too much,
[48:16.380 --> 48:21.380]  but there were whispers that the supply constraint
[48:21.660 --> 48:24.320]  of Thunderbolt displays was going down,
[48:24.320 --> 48:28.580]  and it's just one of these catch-22
[48:28.580 --> 48:32.520]  chicken-and-the-egg problems, which comes first.
[48:32.520 --> 48:37.520]  Well, they desperately need a Retina standalone display.
[48:38.480 --> 48:40.680]  At this point, once you're used to Retina
[48:40.680 --> 48:43.600]  on all of your devices, from the watch to your phone
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.120]  to your iPad, and the iMac has this beautiful,
[48:47.120 --> 48:50.000]  beautiful display, it just sticks out like a sore thumb
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.640]  that their best display for a Mac Pro is not Retina,
[48:53.640 --> 48:55.960]  and it's like, for me at this point,
[48:55.960 --> 48:57.720]  I almost can't believe how, I can't believe
[48:57.720 --> 48:59.880]  I lived my whole life before Retina displays.
[48:59.880 --> 49:04.880]  They're so fuzzy, and so it sticks out,
[49:05.240 --> 49:08.040]  but if they make it, what drives it?
[49:09.640 --> 49:11.200]  If they came out with a 5K Retina display,
[49:11.200 --> 49:13.220]  I think that the existing Mac Pro
[49:13.220 --> 49:14.560]  wouldn't be able to drive it.
[49:14.560 --> 49:17.560]  Well, again, there's a whole bunch of asterisks on that.
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.240]  It could with dual cables, maybe,
[49:21.240 --> 49:22.420]  and with certain hacks.
[49:22.420 --> 49:25.400]  Basically, the way that displays are driven
[49:25.400 --> 49:29.680]  over Thunderbolt ports is way more complicated.
[49:29.680 --> 49:32.640]  The more, as time goes on, I learn even more about it,
[49:32.640 --> 49:34.620]  and I learn how little I know about it,
[49:34.620 --> 49:36.720]  and basically, there's an asterisk on everything,
[49:36.720 --> 49:39.100]  and it's not as simple as, well,
[49:39.100 --> 49:40.920]  Thunderbolt doesn't have enough bandwidth for this,
[49:40.920 --> 49:42.880]  because it isn't technically Thunderbolt's
[49:42.880 --> 49:44.320]  display port that runs that, and it's like,
[49:44.320 --> 49:45.760]  there's all these little asterisks, and like,
[49:45.760 --> 49:47.920]  well, you can make a bridge chip that did this,
[49:47.920 --> 49:50.200]  you can use this hack over the cable to do this,
[49:50.200 --> 49:52.120]  and it's basically a mess right now,
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.380]  and it will be much cleaner and simpler
[49:54.380 --> 49:56.100]  with Thunderbolt 3.
[49:56.100 --> 49:59.860]  I remember when the original 5K iMac came out,
[49:59.860 --> 50:02.200]  the first one, which is what I'm using right now.
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.360]  Do you have the new one, or do you have the original one?
[50:04.360 --> 50:05.200]  I have the same one you do.
[50:05.200 --> 50:07.920]  Yeah, so I have the exact same one that you do,
[50:07.920 --> 50:11.120]  and I was talking after it was announced,
[50:11.120 --> 50:13.600]  and I got to talk, and I had like a product briefing,
[50:13.600 --> 50:15.520]  and they explained to me, like,
[50:15.520 --> 50:17.200]  some of the product marketing people explained
[50:17.200 --> 50:19.080]  exactly how they're driving it inside,
[50:19.080 --> 50:21.060]  and it's just amazing, it's such a hack.
[50:21.060 --> 50:23.260]  I mean, not like a bad hack, like a dirty hack,
[50:23.260 --> 50:25.880]  but it's, you know, it's just crazy,
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.700]  but it totally makes sense as to,
[50:27.700 --> 50:30.580]  it's like the embodiment of why Apple likes to make
[50:30.580 --> 50:33.520]  an all-in-one product, because all of that ugliness,
[50:33.520 --> 50:36.120]  they can just encapsulate it inside the thing,
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.160]  and we'll just take care of it, and we'll write our own,
[50:39.160 --> 50:40.440]  I mean, they mentioned this on the event,
[50:40.440 --> 50:42.880]  the, what do they call it, the custom, whatever.
[50:42.880 --> 50:44.600]  The t-con, the timing controller.
[50:44.600 --> 50:46.240]  The timing controller, because it's like,
[50:46.240 --> 50:47.760]  they have to have these,
[50:47.760 --> 50:49.440]  the reason they have a custom timing controller,
[50:49.440 --> 50:51.560]  I think I have it in lay terms,
[50:51.560 --> 50:55.280]  but because they need like two cables to do it,
[50:55.280 --> 50:56.900]  they need this timing controller
[50:56.900 --> 50:59.760]  so that the two signals coming in
[50:59.760 --> 51:01.640]  look like you're just getting one picture.
[51:01.640 --> 51:02.800]  Yeah, that's basically it, yeah.
[51:02.800 --> 51:05.560]  It's two pictures that are being combined in once
[51:05.560 --> 51:07.980]  out of, you know, Apple's very high frame rate
[51:07.980 --> 51:09.120]  so that you don't notice anything.
[51:09.120 --> 51:12.120]  They needed to write a custom timing controller.
[51:12.120 --> 51:15.560]  It just perfectly embodies why Apple likes to make devices
[51:15.560 --> 51:17.920]  like the iMac rather than the Mac Pro
[51:17.920 --> 51:19.160]  with a standalone display.
[51:20.100 --> 51:22.960]  So I think what's going on, I think what's going on
[51:22.960 --> 51:26.600]  is that they're going to release a 5K cinema display
[51:26.600 --> 51:28.420]  and they're gonna release new Mac Pros
[51:28.420 --> 51:30.840]  and they're gonna release new MacBook Pros,
[51:32.260 --> 51:34.660]  but it's like they can't release any of them
[51:34.660 --> 51:36.260]  until they're all ready, I think.
[51:37.280 --> 51:39.960]  Honestly, that's probably just like a choice
[51:39.960 --> 51:41.640]  that they want to release them all together.
[51:41.640 --> 51:43.880]  I mean, they probably could stagger them a little bit
[51:43.880 --> 51:45.240]  if they really felt like it,
[51:45.240 --> 51:46.920]  but the fact is it doesn't really matter.
[51:46.920 --> 51:48.000]  We don't really know.
[51:48.000 --> 51:49.560]  Yeah, I guess they obviously could, for example,
[51:49.560 --> 51:51.000]  they could release new Mac Pros
[51:51.000 --> 51:52.520]  that are capable of driving this thing
[51:52.520 --> 51:55.200]  and just say, just use your old crappy Dell monitor
[51:55.200 --> 51:56.040]  or whatever.
[51:56.040 --> 51:56.880]  Exactly.
[51:56.880 --> 52:00.320]  So that's probably sometime in the next six months,
[52:00.320 --> 52:01.680]  we're probably getting all of these things.
[52:01.680 --> 52:04.000]  If I would hazard a guess, I'm guessing,
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.600]  well, the Mac Pro is a bit of a problem because the,
[52:07.600 --> 52:09.000]  well, of course, it's always a bit of a problem,
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.400]  but the type of Xeon it would use
[52:12.400 --> 52:14.000]  if it's being released this fall
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.600]  would most likely be the Broadwell Xeon.
[52:16.600 --> 52:19.560]  The Skylake Xeon is coming out sometime next year
[52:19.560 --> 52:22.680]  and it's a really big improvement for the Xeon platform.
[52:22.680 --> 52:23.680]  Like, there's a lot of other stuff
[52:23.680 --> 52:25.200]  that goes along with that.
[52:25.200 --> 52:28.360]  So I'm kind of afraid that Apple's gonna wait for that.
[52:29.560 --> 52:31.600]  And if they do, or if they don't wait,
[52:31.600 --> 52:33.320]  will Syracuse await?
[52:33.320 --> 52:35.440]  Yeah, well, he's always gonna wait.
[52:35.440 --> 52:37.280]  Syracuse's back is to the wall.
[52:37.280 --> 52:38.680]  People who don't listen to ATP,
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.440]  and I bet the overlap here is like 90%.
[52:40.440 --> 52:41.280]  Yeah, probably.
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.280]  But the macOS Sierra doesn't officially run on John's.
[52:46.280 --> 52:51.280]  He's using like a 1998 Bondi Blue Power Mac.
[52:55.640 --> 52:57.320]  Doesn't run on it.
[52:58.280 --> 52:59.320]  It's finally been dropped.
[52:59.320 --> 53:01.320]  So now he's in the conundrum
[53:01.320 --> 53:03.200]  where he's been waiting for all of these years,
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.640]  20, 22 years or something like that to upgrade his Mac Pro.
[53:06.640 --> 53:10.280]  And now he either has to,
[53:10.280 --> 53:13.000]  or he won't be able to run macOS Sierra on it.
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.840]  Or there's one of those like hack bootloader programs
[53:15.840 --> 53:17.920]  that will like modify Sierra to actually work.
[53:17.920 --> 53:19.120]  Cause like it actually does work.
[53:19.120 --> 53:21.760]  They just don't feel like supporting it basically.
[53:21.760 --> 53:23.800]  So like you actually could install it
[53:23.800 --> 53:26.360]  through this like unofficially supported hack.
[53:26.360 --> 53:29.560]  So like, what do you think is more offensive to Syracuse?
[53:29.560 --> 53:30.400]  No, I think that.
[53:30.400 --> 53:32.320]  Running the hack, or not running it,
[53:32.320 --> 53:33.520]  or buying a new Mac Pro.
[53:33.520 --> 53:35.440]  That he knows is gonna be obsoleted soon.
[53:35.440 --> 53:39.480]  Right, like this is a really tough position to put him in.
[53:39.480 --> 53:42.840]  Boy, it's almost like a perfect dilemma.
[53:42.840 --> 53:44.560]  And it has a new file system.
[53:44.560 --> 53:45.960]  Yeah.
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.960]  And it's the only way that he could use it.
[53:51.320 --> 53:52.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[53:52.160 --> 53:53.000]  No, no, no.
[53:53.000 --> 53:54.800]  They are gonna come out with the file system
[53:54.800 --> 53:56.160]  for El Capitan, right?
[53:56.160 --> 53:57.000]  I think so.
[53:57.000 --> 53:57.840]  No.
[53:57.840 --> 53:58.680]  No?
[53:58.680 --> 53:59.600]  No.
[53:59.600 --> 54:01.400]  Why would they do that?
[54:01.400 --> 54:03.520]  I thought that they were going to.
[54:03.520 --> 54:05.760]  So that you could like plug a disc into El Cap.
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.640]  But maybe by the time the file system actually ships
[54:07.640 --> 54:11.000]  that Sierra will be the old release.
[54:11.000 --> 54:11.840]  I don't know.
[54:11.840 --> 54:12.680]  I don't know.
[54:12.680 --> 54:15.160]  It's very funny though.
[54:15.160 --> 54:17.040]  I mean, this really was like a masterful trolling
[54:17.040 --> 54:18.200]  of Syracuse this year.
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.720]  It really was, it really is.
[54:19.720 --> 54:21.280]  But it's his own fault for not buying.
[54:21.280 --> 54:23.440]  He should have bought the Mac Pro as we know it
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.860]  as soon as it came out.
[54:24.860 --> 54:26.520]  Yeah, and I even offered to sell him.
[54:26.520 --> 54:29.560]  When I sold my 2010 era one, which does run this,
[54:29.560 --> 54:32.240]  which is decently better than his 2008,
[54:32.240 --> 54:34.520]  I offered to sell to him for a really good present,
[54:34.520 --> 54:36.480]  well below market, just because I wanted to get rid of it.
[54:36.480 --> 54:38.120]  I don't want to deal with selling it.
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.200]  And he was like, no, I'll just wait.
[54:40.200 --> 54:41.480]  I'm happy with my 2008.
[54:41.480 --> 54:42.320]  Okay.
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.880]  The best time to buy a computer is when it's brand new.
[54:46.880 --> 54:48.900]  And maybe if you're really smart,
[54:48.900 --> 54:51.600]  buy it like just a little after it comes out
[54:51.600 --> 54:53.080]  so you can read initial reviews
[54:53.080 --> 54:55.040]  and just make sure there's not like something
[54:55.040 --> 54:55.880]  really stinky about it.
[54:55.880 --> 54:57.960]  Right, buy it like a month or two in.
[54:57.960 --> 54:59.520]  Yeah, like six weeks in.
[54:59.520 --> 55:00.360]  Because like Apple doesn't,
[55:00.360 --> 55:01.800]  they don't lower their prices over time
[55:01.800 --> 55:02.920]  as the computers get older.
[55:02.920 --> 55:04.480]  Like you're paying the same price
[55:04.480 --> 55:07.120]  and getting the same computer on day number 900
[55:07.120 --> 55:09.480]  of the Mac Pro as you were paying on day zero.
[55:09.480 --> 55:12.600]  So like who's, I just can't even imagine
[55:12.600 --> 55:14.240]  who's buying a Mac Pro right now.
[55:14.240 --> 55:16.000]  I mean, if you have to,
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.100]  I just imagine that almost everyone they're selling
[55:18.100 --> 55:20.020]  right now is through gritted teeth.
[55:20.020 --> 55:22.560]  Like somebody who's old one broke
[55:22.560 --> 55:24.720]  or they've made a new hire.
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.360]  You know, we've got a new guy on the staff.
[55:26.360 --> 55:31.360]  We got to get him a Mac Pro or something like that.
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.540]  Right.
[55:32.540 --> 55:35.320]  It's like if you drop your iPhone in a toilet in like August
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.220]  and you're like, damn it.
[55:37.220 --> 55:39.540]  But like, you know, that makes people mad.
[55:39.540 --> 55:41.240]  Like this is yet another reason
[55:41.240 --> 55:43.200]  why Apple needs to really look at this
[55:43.200 --> 55:44.480]  and see if they could do this better
[55:44.480 --> 55:45.440]  and release things more often.
[55:45.440 --> 55:49.680]  Because like right now if you buy any Mac Pro
[55:49.680 --> 55:51.760]  and even, you know, yeah, not a lot of people
[55:51.760 --> 55:52.600]  buy the Mac Pro.
[55:52.600 --> 55:53.900]  But you know what a lot of people buy?
[55:53.900 --> 55:55.240]  The MacBook Pro.
[55:55.240 --> 55:57.400]  And that is also really outdated.
[55:57.400 --> 56:00.520]  And you know, to have people
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.760]  knowing that these things are old and outdated.
[56:02.760 --> 56:03.700]  And I think a lot of people,
[56:03.700 --> 56:05.280]  I mean not every buyer knows that,
[56:05.280 --> 56:07.120]  but I think a lot of buyers do.
[56:07.120 --> 56:08.880]  And they're gonna go a whole other summer now
[56:08.880 --> 56:10.560]  of all these back to school sales
[56:10.560 --> 56:12.180]  of like kids going to college,
[56:12.180 --> 56:14.440]  buying a whole bunch of MacBook Pros again,
[56:14.440 --> 56:15.880]  like that everyone kind of knows
[56:15.880 --> 56:17.580]  are basically like three year old hardware.
[56:17.580 --> 56:22.580]  Like man, that, like this is making people unhappy
[56:22.680 --> 56:24.360]  about buying Apple products.
[56:24.360 --> 56:26.360]  That is not where you want them to be.
[56:26.360 --> 56:29.800]  Yeah, because Apple's, I think Apple's mojo
[56:29.800 --> 56:32.040]  is the fact that people love, you know,
[56:32.040 --> 56:33.620]  people love buying Apple products.
[56:33.620 --> 56:35.340]  Exactly.
[56:35.340 --> 56:36.520]  It's like, you know, everybody,
[56:36.520 --> 56:37.720]  it's like your Christmas, you know,
[56:37.720 --> 56:41.260]  people who don't even do unboxing videos
[56:41.260 --> 56:43.280]  save the unboxing video.
[56:43.280 --> 56:45.560]  Yeah, and like when I got my tubes,
[56:45.560 --> 56:47.060]  my cylinder Mac Pro,
[56:47.060 --> 56:49.040]  like a couple months after it was released,
[56:49.040 --> 56:50.840]  I don't know, like February or something of that year,
[56:50.840 --> 56:52.800]  when I got that, I was really happy with it.
[56:52.800 --> 56:54.000]  It was amazing.
[56:54.920 --> 56:56.960]  If, but if I went to buy one today,
[56:56.960 --> 56:59.560]  now that I've already replaced it with an iMac
[56:59.560 --> 57:00.840]  almost two years ago,
[57:02.680 --> 57:04.960]  like it's still the same computer today
[57:04.960 --> 57:09.960]  that I bought, that I ordered in December, 2013.
[57:10.440 --> 57:13.320]  It's really kind of strange, it really is.
[57:13.320 --> 57:15.080]  And you know, it's like, I think I was saying before,
[57:15.080 --> 57:16.580]  it's like, you can even go down the line
[57:16.580 --> 57:18.120]  and just show that the,
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.800]  even within the MacBook family,
[57:21.800 --> 57:25.960]  the MacBook One has gotten a year over year update,
[57:26.960 --> 57:27.900]  you know, less overdue,
[57:27.900 --> 57:30.700]  like the more consumer friendly device
[57:30.700 --> 57:33.880]  is updated more regularly than the professional one.
[57:33.880 --> 57:35.240]  Even within the MacBook lineup,
[57:35.240 --> 57:38.580]  the Pro N seems to get short shrift.
[57:38.580 --> 57:39.840]  Yeah, and that's what I'm saying,
[57:39.840 --> 57:43.000]  like whatever Apple decides,
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.840]  you know what, we need to hold back and wait for X,
[57:45.840 --> 57:46.900]  that needs tweaking.
[57:46.900 --> 57:48.440]  And if for a long time, it was just like,
[57:48.440 --> 57:50.000]  oh, you know, we'll just ship whenever Intel
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.600]  gives new laptop CPUs.
[57:51.600 --> 57:52.840]  But you know, in recent years,
[57:52.840 --> 57:54.560]  Intel has had a lot of delays
[57:54.560 --> 57:55.860]  and has gotten less reliable.
[57:55.860 --> 57:58.240]  So maybe decouple that,
[57:58.240 --> 58:01.520]  or you know, definitely don't skip any,
[58:01.520 --> 58:04.400]  or figure out ways to give more frequent updates.
[58:04.400 --> 58:08.580]  Like last year, when they brought the ForceTux trackpad
[58:08.580 --> 58:10.800]  to the 15 inch MacBook Pro,
[58:10.800 --> 58:13.280]  so like, you know, it has technically been updated,
[58:13.280 --> 58:16.640]  but notice that almost nothing else about it changed.
[58:16.640 --> 58:18.760]  From what I heard, the reason why is that
[58:18.760 --> 58:20.820]  the GPU it was using was so old
[58:20.820 --> 58:22.280]  that Nvidia stopped making it,
[58:22.280 --> 58:24.360]  or ATI, whichever one it was,
[58:24.360 --> 58:26.360]  like they just stopped making the part.
[58:26.360 --> 58:28.560]  And Apple was still selling these brand new,
[58:28.560 --> 58:29.840]  in the 15 inch MacBook Pro,
[58:29.840 --> 58:31.360]  their highest end laptop.
[58:31.360 --> 58:32.920]  Oh man.
[58:32.920 --> 58:35.320]  And if that's true, I mean, that's really embarrassing.
[58:35.320 --> 58:37.660]  Hey, we just crossed the one hour marker a little bit ago.
[58:37.660 --> 58:39.180]  So I think we're on pace for a two hour show.
[58:39.180 --> 58:40.020]  We'll see.
[58:40.020 --> 58:41.000]  Yeah, okay.
[58:41.000 --> 58:42.280]  You haven't seen the length of my notes
[58:42.280 --> 58:43.100]  for the headphone jack.
[58:43.100 --> 58:44.000]  I made an outline.
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.280]  You're in trouble.
[58:45.280 --> 58:46.260]  Let me take another break here
[58:46.260 --> 58:48.280]  and thank our very good friends,
[58:48.280 --> 58:50.240]  long time sponsor of the show, Audible.
[58:51.520 --> 58:55.320]  Audible.com has an unmatched selection of audio books,
[58:55.320 --> 59:00.020]  original audio shows, news, comedy, and more.
[59:00.020 --> 59:04.380]  Get a free 30 day trial at Audible.com slash talk show.
[59:04.380 --> 59:06.960]  They've been advertising on podcasts forever.
[59:06.960 --> 59:08.640]  And I always say it's duh,
[59:08.640 --> 59:11.200]  because anybody who's listening to me tell you right now
[59:11.200 --> 59:13.500]  about Audible is somebody who enjoys spoken word content.
[59:13.500 --> 59:15.240]  And that's what Audible has.
[59:15.240 --> 59:16.840]  They've got gobs and gobs.
[59:16.840 --> 59:19.580]  Untold, you don't have enough hours left in your life,
[59:19.580 --> 59:22.480]  probably, to listen to everything that Audible has.
[59:23.520 --> 59:25.200]  I used to think, here's one thing about Audible
[59:25.200 --> 59:27.140]  that is eye opening to me,
[59:27.140 --> 59:31.160]  is that I always thought of them as the audio books company.
[59:31.160 --> 59:35.280]  And they do have thousands and thousands of audio books.
[59:35.280 --> 59:38.440]  But the other types of content they have,
[59:38.440 --> 59:41.560]  like I just said, the original audio shows,
[59:41.560 --> 59:44.980]  news, the comedy, and stuff like that,
[59:44.980 --> 59:46.380]  tons of stuff like that too.
[59:46.380 --> 59:50.280]  So even if you're not into audio books,
[59:50.280 --> 59:53.360]  like hearing a novel read out loud or something like that,
[59:53.360 --> 59:54.760]  there is tons of stuff there
[59:54.760 --> 59:56.040]  if you like spoken word content.
[59:56.040 --> 59:57.760]  And if you don't like spoken word content,
[59:57.760 --> 59:59.640]  I don't understand how you are
[59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.240]  hearing me talk to you right now.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.660]  So go there, check them out.
[01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.800]  You can get a 30-day free trial,
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.960]  and you just sign up at audible.com slash talk show.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.900]  No the, just slash talk show.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.640]  Go there, thanks to Audible for sponsoring our show.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.960]  Go there and fill up your phone with audio content.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.280]  All right, let's talk about the headphone jack.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.120]  Sure, you wanted a short show.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.200]  Let's see, I'm fascinated by this.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.520]  I wanted to write about this a few months ago.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.200]  And it was one of those things
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.320]  where I'd collected a lot of notes
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.200]  and had some thoughts on it.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.220]  And just, I think it's one of those ones
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.720]  where having a podcast sort of hurts
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.080]  my column at Daring Fireball.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.400]  Because it was like I talked about it
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.900]  with a couple people on this show over a week or two.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.080]  And then it's like I felt like I got it out of my system
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.600]  so I never wrote about it.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.200]  See, this is where you're in trouble now.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.080]  Because a few months ago,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.840]  when the rumor first started going around,
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.680]  we all talked about it.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.960]  Like I talked about it on ATP.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.020]  I remember.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.820]  And so I probably won't get a chance
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.480]  to talk about it on ATP this week.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.480]  So therefore I'm gonna dump this all on you.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.320]  Okay.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.100]  Because it's interesting, like you know,
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.660]  so this kind of flamed up again this week
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.240]  because Nilay Patel at The Verge
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.400]  wrote this big thing about it.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.680]  Well I'll go back one step though.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.760]  Yeah, where did it start?
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.960]  With Daisuke Wakabayashi published a story
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.760]  in the Wall Street Journal Monday.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.560]  More or less confirming all the stuff that we've heard.
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.280]  That the next iPhone is going to largely look
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.520]  like the iPhone 6 and 6S.
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.280]  Removal of the headphone port
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.680]  would be one of the main features.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.840]  Features?
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.640]  Changes, changes, changes.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.840]  I'll even, I will happily rescind that
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.340]  and change it to changes.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.020]  I forget.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.560]  But just a whole bunch of things that we've heard
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.600]  rumored for a while coming out of the supply chain.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.840]  And Wakabayashi had sources familiar with the matter
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.740]  who couldn't speak for whatever reason confirm them.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.720]  Which is worthwhile.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.060]  It's, you know, it didn't have any,
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:02.560]  there's nothing in it that I hadn't seen before.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.880]  But it's always worthwhile when somebody with the stature
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.560]  and the track record of the Wall Street Journal confirms it.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.140]  But then after that, that's when Nilay published.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.820]  What was the headline?
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.680]  I forget, it was something like six reasons
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.800]  why you don't want the removable headphone jack.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.360]  And he even said in his Twitter link to it.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.920]  Taking the headphone jack off iPhones
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.740]  is user hostile and stupid.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.440]  And he even kind of like disclaimed
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.880]  in his Twitter link to it like,
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.200]  I was really angry when I wrote this,
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.040]  so it probably sucks.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.200]  It was something like that.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.960]  So I give him the benefit of the doubt on that.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.520]  And a lot of his points I thought were valid and good.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.320]  Not all, I didn't agree with all of it,
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.400]  but I think I agree with most of it.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.520]  And then you wrote this rebuttal piece,
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.960]  mostly rebutting him, I think,
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.000]  that was basically like, it's progress,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.320]  it's going to happen, why not now?
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.940]  Is that a fair summary?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.120]  Yes, it's going to happen eventually.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.920]  Maybe, why not now?
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.560]  If there's one thing that seems like people misread in it,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.280]  I think Steve Strese had a piece on Medium.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.440]  And his assumption is that I was arguing
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.080]  that this is a good change for iPhone users.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:14.960]  And I never said that.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.440]  If you read my thing, I never said that
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.300]  because I don't know.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.160]  I have no idea what they're replacing it with.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.800]  I don't know, and Wakabayashi didn't either.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.040]  I think people assume that the default earbuds
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.600]  will be lightning if they're getting rid of the audio port.
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.440]  What do we call it?
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.280]  What is it called?
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.100]  Standard headphone jack?
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:33.940]  It doesn't even have a name.
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.780]  It has a few names.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.080]  Technically, it's one of the family of phone plugs.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.440]  And it is specifically a 3.5 millimeter TRRS jack.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:45.460]  Well, the TRRS jack.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:46.120]  You're welcome.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.000]  I think most people assume that the standard earbuds are going
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.400]  to be lightning because then they
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.880]  don't have to have batteries.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.340]  And there's no latency.
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.720]  There's all sorts of good reasons
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.180]  why you'd still want a wired set of earphones, earbuds,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.040]  whatever you want to call them.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.480]  Could be that the defaults will be Bluetooth
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.360]  or some other new proprietary wireless thing.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.200]  Bluetooth seems like an upsell.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.640]  It does to me, too.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.500]  Also, if they were going to have a proprietary wireless thing,
[01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.280]  that would have been using the Apple Watch
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.200]  because Bluetooth sucks for the Apple Watch.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.800]  So they definitely would have used it there if they had one.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.120]  Well, maybe it wasn't ready yet.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.640]  It's possible.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.320]  Maybe it's up there with the Skylake Xeons.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]  All right, I don't know.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.240]  But who knows?
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.440]  But I just don't know.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.760]  I don't know what the story is.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.900]  And so my argument is more I think that the removal
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:36.560]  of this port is inevitable.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.040]  Will it be there in 50 years?
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.400]  I just, no way.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:40.520]  So what is the time frame?
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.040]  Well, it was there 50 years ago.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:43.640]  That is true.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:49.360]  And I think it has had a remarkable run.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.800]  But I feel like the time is up.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.520]  So just for the sake of argument here,
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.900]  I looked this up before the show.
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.120]  There's a Wikipedia article on the phone plug.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.280]  The large, have you ever seen a stereo from the 70s?
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.280]  Or if you're a high-end headphone nerd
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.160]  and you've seen the quarter inch version of the plug,
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.640]  it's basically, it looks just like the regular one,
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.520]  but it's about twice as big in both dimensions.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.640]  Yes.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.320]  That version was invented in 1878 for use in phone exchanges.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.120]  And the stereo version that we mostly know today
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.720]  that has the two rings halfway through,
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.420]  so it has like three total areas of plug.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.400]  And it's smaller, the 3.5 millimeter one.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.500]  That one appeared roughly in 1964
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:35.600]  and became popular with the original Sony Walkman in 1979.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.800]  So we're talking about at least a good 40 years.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.560]  So this thing is old.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.680]  And the reason it has lasted so long
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.100]  is because it is universal.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:51.360]  It is very simple electrically.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.880]  It's very, very simple.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.040]  There is no smarts to it.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.820]  It's just pure analog signal going over these two or three
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.080]  wires inside the cable, or in the case of the headphone
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.640]  remote, four wires inside the cable.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.760]  Very, very simple electrically.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.280]  They're very reliable for the most part.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.760]  The port can get gunked up with dust,
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:12.400]  but so can the lightning port, so can any port.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:15.280]  So compared to other ports, it's not particularly bad
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.920]  for reliability.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.640]  It's very, very durable.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.600]  And it's very, very cheap.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.640]  So you have this combination of standard, universal, cheap,
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.560]  durable, simple.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.320]  It's really great for all these things.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.600]  And by the way, if you think it's too thick,
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.880]  there is also a thinner version.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.720]  So this version is 3.5 millimeter.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.120]  There's a 2.5 millimeter version that
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:39.000]  used to be on some answering machines.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.480]  And then more recently, it's often
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.320]  used on the ear end of removable headphone cables,
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.520]  where you'll have the end that plugs into the phone,
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.720]  and then the other end plugs into your ear cup.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.160]  Sometimes that end will be the skinnier one.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.840]  You might have a couple of those.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.560]  I've seen that.
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:54.760]  I used to own something that had that.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.400]  I don't know what the hell it was, though.
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.240]  It doesn't matter.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.760]  Well, and the other thing about making the devices thinner
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.200]  with the standard headphone jack,
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.040]  I keep pointing this out over and over again,
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.120]  the iPod Touch still has it, and the iPod Touch
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.760]  is significantly thinner than the current iPhones.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.760]  Yep, and the Nano, too.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.840]  I believe that's also thinner, and that also has it.
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:16.200]  So the reason to remove it now isn't a thickness barrier,
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.640]  because we see Apple makes thinner devices with this.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.560]  So that's not the reason.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.520]  I would also say, in my category of reasons
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.200]  it doesn't have to go yet, assuming
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.720]  it has to go at some time, one of the reasons this might not
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.400]  be the time is, what are we gaining by removing it?
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.840]  Because there's cost removing it.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.920]  So I think one thing we're gaining
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.480]  would be a lot of people assume space for the battery,
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.480]  except that if you look at the teardowns of where
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.680]  this port is on the phone, down there at the bottom,
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:47.520]  next to the lightning assembly and everything,
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.480]  and then on the other side you have the speaker,
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.240]  and next to it you have the microphone and everything.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.960]  Down there, that's not where you need space for the battery.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.400]  I mean, they could go to some kind of crazy system
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.260]  like the MacBook One, where they have different shapes
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:02.120]  of battery things all over the place, but this is a phone,
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.080]  and they have to replace a lot of phone batteries
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.880]  under warranty, and people replace them aftermarket,
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.680]  when they're old and in different countries
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.040]  and everything.
[01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.480]  You need the battery to be easily
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.360]  serviceable, replaceable, and cheap.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.800]  And so keeping it as one regular rectangle of a battery
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.600]  is way more practical for them.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.440]  And also, the total amount of space you would save,
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.940]  or a space you would gain by invading that little rectangle
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.760]  of area at the bottom of the phone where the headphone jack
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.840]  is, you can just make the battery some minuscule amount
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.400]  thicker and keep it in the same footprint,
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.240]  and it would have that same volume increase
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.640]  and be way cheaper and easier to deal with.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:43.640]  So battery life is probably not the reason either,
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.440]  because of just where it is in the phone
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.320]  and what else is down there.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.560]  I don't really see a massive internal redesign
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.800]  of the phone layout inside where that space
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.440]  would suddenly become space you could expand
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.280]  the battery into.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.400]  It might, but I think it's unlikely.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.280]  Well, I think it goes far enough in that
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.600]  the space is significant, but I don't think it's huge.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.520]  I think the biggest space-saving argument,
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.680]  or three-dimensional, this thing is just too big
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.600]  or too thick or too long argument,
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.720]  would probably have to do with next year's new iPhone,
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.280]  which I believe, and I've mentioned it on the show
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.400]  and I know there's rumors about it too,
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.940]  that if it goes to more of an edge-to-edge display,
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.720]  which would be like the top and bottom of the display,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.640]  go to the edge as close as the sides do now,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.380]  then I think it's a problem, because I don't,
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.260]  I think it's a lot harder to have,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.800]  the jack would therefore have to be underneath the display.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.160]  Yeah, so remove it then.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.280]  Well, that's what I'm saying, it is a good point.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.400]  That why now, that doesn't count for why now,
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.200]  unless they just possibly just want to eat
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.280]  the shit sandwich now of putting up with people's complaints
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.620]  about this a year in advance of unveiling that phone
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.080]  so that people don't complain about it
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.080]  when the amazing new industrial design is unveiled?
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.360]  And that might be the reason, but that's a crappy reason.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.560]  I don't think that's the reason, though.
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.940]  I do think that there is a reason.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.940]  All I'm saying, and this is the secondary thrust
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.800]  of my argument, which is, well, we don't know.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.360]  How about we just wait and find out what the story is
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.960]  before we complain?
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.120]  It's, to me, it's too soon to say
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.240]  this is user hostile and stupid.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.340]  Right, although it's also too late to change it.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.500]  Right, but we don't have proof
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.200]  that it's not user hostile and stupid.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.040]  It might be.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.560]  I guess that, if there's anything
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.960]  that I wish I would have emphasized more,
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.240]  it's like, okay, maybe it is,
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.640]  but we certainly don't know that yet,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.240]  and it may well not be.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.000]  I'm wondering, and you definitely know more
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.560]  about headphones than I do, is I'm wondering about
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.480]  if it switches to lightning, something digital,
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.280]  how much better could the input be, not just the output?
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.040]  Right now, you think of a headphone's output.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.360]  You put them in, and you listen.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  But the whole input stuff, voice through the microphone,
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.720]  and the little clicks, there's play pause
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.020]  and fast forward and stuff like that.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.760]  I mean, you write a podcast player.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.960]  That stuff is all, that's just a serious hack.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.300]  It is a hack, but it also works.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.800]  Yeah, but maybe.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.000]  The main thing that you can say from that point of view
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:14.840]  is that it's limiting.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.640]  For example, you can only have mono input right now,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.000]  because there's only one pin for the microphone return.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.880]  So you can only have one channel.
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.880]  So if you wanted to have a nicer microphone set up,
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.680]  maybe if you wanted to podcast or record something
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.520]  from your device, if you're using that port,
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.040]  you can only record a mono.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.320]  And lightning devices can add much more than that.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.080]  They can have all sorts of inputs and outputs,
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.360]  and especially if they have custom apps to deal with them,
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.280]  then they can do, and most of them do.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.680]  But that also isn't a good argument,
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.960]  because well, we already have that now.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.080]  You don't have to remove the headphone port
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.680]  to have lightning audio.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.560]  We have lightning audio already, and we also
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560]  have the headphone port.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.160]  Yeah, but.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:58.960]  You know?
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.400]  And there's also, by the way, while we're on this topic,
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:05.080]  there's a huge argument going around
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.320]  with the pro side of this, that this could
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.080]  enable better audio quality.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.560]  And let me tell you, as an audio file, that is complete garbage.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.360]  First of all, you have the same problem of like, well,
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.280]  if lightning headphones can be better, great.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.400]  We can have that now.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.680]  We don't need to remove the headphone jack
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.760]  to make that happen.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.280]  And the way iOS handles audio devices,
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.720]  if any other device is connected via lightning or USB
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.540]  or whatever, that device just takes over
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.960]  from the built-in microphone and speakers and headphones
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.840]  and everything else.
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.840]  So you don't even have to, the software
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.960]  doesn't have to do anything to take
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.840]  advantage of lightning connected audio devices.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.760]  It just works.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.880]  So there's basically no downside from that point of view
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.100]  to keeping the headphone jack around.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.120]  And the idea that some people have
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.640]  that a lightning connected headphone would have better
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.000]  audio quality, because you could have a really nice DAC
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.760]  and amp.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.160]  That DAC is the DAC digital audio converter
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.840]  that literally converts the digital signal to the sound
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.000]  that you hear.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.120]  And then, of course, the amp amplifies that to different
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.080]  volumes for you.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.880]  At some point, it has to go to analog.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.680]  There's no, because it's actually
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.880]  going to put sound waves into your ear.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.380]  Right.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:13.800]  And so that has to be.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.760]  And so I wouldn't worry about the DRM angle like Neil
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.440]  and I did, because it would be trivial to,
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.440]  if you're actually relying on analog output
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.200]  to capture, to rerecord, to pirate something,
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.720]  it would be trivial to just take apart the headphones
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.720]  and connect a couple of things to the wires
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.360]  that go to the drivers, and that'd be it.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.800]  So that part of the DRM is not a concern.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.000]  Licensing the connector is, but I'll get to that.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.120]  But the idea that you get better audio quality out
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.520]  of having separate premium headphones that
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.880]  have premium DACs and amps in them,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.560]  that is possible.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.560]  However, it's extremely unlikely in reality.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.720]  Because in reality, it is very difficult
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.320]  to distinguish differences between DACs and amps,
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.760]  especially once you've crossed a minimum threshold.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.600]  And people who make this argument
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:03.400]  are often talking about how DACs and computers are always
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.040]  crappy.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.360]  And the fact is, they were really crappy,
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.280]  like in the 90s.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.560]  That's when they were crappy.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.960]  And most built-in headphone jacks and sound cards
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.120]  that are in computers and are phones and tablets today
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.280]  are pretty decent.
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:17.960]  They're fine.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.400]  And the limiting factor to how good they can sound
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.840]  is not the quality of the DAC and the amp in the phone.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.240]  It's almost always the limiting factor
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.240]  is the headphones that you're using
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:31.120]  and the environment you're listening in.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.200]  That's it.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.600]  When you're listening on your phone, you might be commuting.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.480]  You might be outside.
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.160]  You might be in a loud, shared office.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.960]  And you're probably listening on headphones
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.320]  that are, at best, decent, probably not amazing,
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.560]  probably not like the big, full-sized, open-backed ones
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.320]  that audiophiles like to listen critically with.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.480]  And those headphones you're listening on,
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.040]  there's so much room for improvement in the sound
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:58.240]  just by better headphones, better drivers, better
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.800]  tuning of the sound to make it less trying to imitate
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.760]  beats badly and more just trying to sound good.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.280]  That is where improvement comes from.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.600]  It does not come from in the portable realm.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.880]  It does not usually come from different DACs and amps.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.800]  DACs and amps are just a really nice way
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.880]  to sell overpriced stuff to people who want better sound
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.800]  but never consider the fact that they should just
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.640]  buy better headphones.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.640]  I saw somebody today, and I don't remember who.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.400]  No, that's OK.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.000]  This is good.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.800]  Somebody today was speculating that maybe they will switch.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.720]  They'll do a noise canceling thing.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.600]  And they'll have the stuff on the phone doing it.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.080]  Right now when you buy noise canceling headphones,
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.280]  you have to put batteries in the actual headphones,
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.120]  like when you buy them from Bose or whatever,
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.640]  because it takes power to actually do
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.240]  the noise canceling.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.560]  So the phone could do it.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.240]  But I find that unlikely.
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.400]  It sounds good when you think, oh, noise canceling.
[01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.280]  Some people like noise canceling headphones.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.600]  And in certain scenarios, like being on an airplane,
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.040]  really is very useful.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.760]  But that sounds very unlikely to me
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.400]  that anybody is going to find it a good idea
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:08.640]  to have headphones that draw power from your iPhone.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.320]  Like when you're using the headphones,
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.800]  you will get worse battery life.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.720]  Like that doesn't sound like something people
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.920]  are going to sign up for.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.320]  Like there is a, like one of Nilay's things was.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:24.600]  Yeah, I mean, in reality, it isn't that much power.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.960]  But it's still not trivial.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.280]  But the reality is like the high end headphones,
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.960]  like noise canceling and everything,
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.800]  those are all moving to Bluetooth now.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.000]  And I believe I have things to say about Bluetooth as well.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.200]  But I think like a whole other side of this argument
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.200]  is like, oh, well, lightning headphones will be great.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.040]  But you know what?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.760]  Lightning headphones are very expensive.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.000]  Like their premium price, right now there's very few of them.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.760]  And the few of these are very expensive.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.080]  They will always be more expensive than other headphones
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.040]  because they're going to have the Apple licensing,
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.560]  the MFI stuff.
[01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.240]  And then they're going to want to be sold
[01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.280]  on Apple retail stores.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.800]  They're going to have these, you know,
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.680]  I'm guessing most lightning headphones
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.560]  are going to be above $300 in all likelihood.
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.560]  And so you're going to have this stuff.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.300]  But the problem is, if you look at the headphone market,
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.960]  everyone's kind of freaking out and trying
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.340]  to rush out Bluetooth models in the last couple of years.
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.840]  Because everybody wants noise canceling and Bluetooth
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.600]  in the high end.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.360]  Like if you're looking at high end headphones,
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.320]  like headphones that cost more than $200 that are for iPhones
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320]  or for portable use, like everybody
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.480]  wants Bluetooth and noise canceling.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.360]  And so that is, in many ways, that's
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.460]  an argument for the headphone jack removal.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.320]  Because you can say, well, if everyone's going Bluetooth,
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.040]  then we don't need this, right?
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:45.880]  And this is why I think like Bluetooth is, in many ways,
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.760]  it is worse than wired headphones.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.080]  In many ways, it's a lot worse than wired headphones.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.160]  Like the sound quality is usually pretty rough.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.720]  By the way, the reason the sound quality is pretty rough
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.720]  is not usually because of lossy compression over Bluetooth.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.920]  It is usually because the headphones are
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.120]  kind of mediocre or garbagey.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.000]  And they have, guess what?
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.760]  They have a built in DAC and AMP in every Bluetooth headphone
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.360]  because it has to, because it is not powered by your phone.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.640]  And the signal is transmitted digitally from your phone.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.760]  So we already have a world full of aftermarket DACs and AMPs
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.840]  in headphones.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.400]  And they're all garbage.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.680]  And the most sophisticated things they do
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.680]  are they tweak the audio.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.760]  They tweak the EQ curve of the audio coming out
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.660]  of the headphones to make up for crappy headphone drivers.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.640]  So if you have headphones that say,
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.300]  suppose they have really weak bass,
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.120]  and they know that everybody wants strong bass,
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.160]  they'll just use the DAC AMP chip in the Bluetooth headphone.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.120]  They will tweak the sound before they send it out
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:54.360]  to the driver to just artificially boost the bass.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.200]  And these are cheap components doing things
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.160]  in a very basic way.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.560]  And it sounds pretty rough.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.280]  And you can hear this yourself.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.560]  If you have noise canceling headphones,
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.280]  like any Bose headphones that also can operate with a wire
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.240]  passively, if you can turn off the noise canceling
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.740]  and use them with the wire, turn it off
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.880]  and listen to how much worse everything sounds.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.400]  What you're hearing when it's off,
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.320]  that's what the headphones actually sound like.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.400]  And when you turn it on, they're applying this big EQ curve
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.880]  to try to boost it and make it sound better artificially,
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.520]  but it's never quite right.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.320]  It never sounds great or natural.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.120]  That's the world we're going towards.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.000]  If we're going towards more Bluetooth, more lightning,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.360]  headphones that are not just passive analog devices,
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.760]  but actually have active circuitry in them,
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.480]  it's not going towards a world of amazing DACs and amps
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:48.360]  in portable headphones, it's going towards a world
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.760]  of mediocre headphones that have their flaws papered over
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:55.080]  by these DSP hacks.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.440]  So what are they gonna do, I feel like if they switch,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.360]  if Apple's story is, okay, buy this new iPhone
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.200]  and when you open it up, you get a pair of our new
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.160]  Bluetooth AirPods or whatever they're gonna call them.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.200]  Somebody had a, there was like a trademark filing
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.720]  on the word AirPod.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.240]  Oh, there's no way that's in the package.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.080]  You don't think so?
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.640]  I'm thinking in the package you get like,
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:19.480]  you get the cable adapted version of them, just like today,
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.880]  and then they will sell you.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.600]  With a lightning port?
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.760]  In some form, whether it's like a dongle
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.320]  and then headphones or whether it's just native headphones.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.680]  There's no way they're shipping a dongle.
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.820]  No way, probably not.
[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:30.920]  They'll definitely sell you one,
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.120]  but they might put one in the box, I don't know.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.400]  Probably not, but either way.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.360]  They might give you a dongle so that you can use
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.540]  your existing headphones if you'd prefer not to,
[01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.220]  but the headphones they give in the box
[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:44.640]  have to just plug right in, and that means it has to be.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.360]  That's probably right, yeah.
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.700]  So I'm guessing that they will gladly sell you
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.220]  a set of AirPods, if that's gonna be a real product name,
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.920]  they will sell you a Bluetooth version of headphones
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.680]  for, I don't know, 150 bucks, 100 bucks maybe.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.400]  That's gonna be an add-on, that's not gonna be in the box.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.720]  Because let's not forget that Apple's really good
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.280]  at making you spend a little bit more money
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.440]  at the point of sale, and all those attachment sales.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.480]  They've mastered this now.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.800]  I think both of these ideas qualify as,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.240]  of course that's what they're going to do, they're Apple.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.860]  Of course Apple isn't gonna make you use a dongle,
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.240]  they're Apple.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:20.160]  There's no way they're gonna make you use a dongle.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.600]  And of course the wireless ones are gonna be
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.040]  expensive upsell, because they're Apple.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.000]  Exactly, so that's sold.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  And the idea of moving towards the world of Bluetooth,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.920]  because let's be honest, it's gonna be mostly Bluetooth,
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.480]  it's not gonna be mostly Lightning headphones,
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.720]  except for the ones that come in the box.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.040]  Those will be very popular.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.280]  But aftermarket headphones I think are gonna be
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.480]  way more often Bluetooth than not in the near future.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.460]  If the story, we're almost there now.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:53.660]  If the story is go with Bluetooth,
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.600]  it solves some of the problems in terms of
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.120]  why would they get rid of the headphone jack?
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.280]  Well, we got rid of it because the future's wireless.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.720]  And it also solves the how do I listen to music
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.320]  while I charge my phone problem, which is a real problem.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.520]  I mean, and I'm, I.
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.460]  The solution is you discharge the other device
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.640]  that you're wearing on your head at the same time.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.520]  Well, how would you do that?
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.360]  No, you're right.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.320]  I mean, the solution is, you know,
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.440]  either they ship a kind of pass-through adapter,
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.240]  which would be pretty clunky.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.080]  Right.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.560]  Or, you know, you just use Bluetooth.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.020]  And when you're using Bluetooth,
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.920]  the iPhone is not concerned with
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.080]  the battery level of your headphones.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080]  That's your problem.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.760]  Yeah, and it does seem, it seems weird to me.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.400]  I have to admit, I mean, this is one of these things
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.460]  ever since the thing started.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.340]  I don't see how they're going to sell this.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.440]  And, you know, what's the story going to be?
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.960]  Because I totally acknowledge,
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:47.100]  like I see Jonas doing it all the time,
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:50.360]  where he's got like an iPad at 3%,
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.600]  and he's charging it while he's still listening
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.460]  to the YouTube stuff that is on it
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:56.000]  while he plays the PlayStation.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.080]  I totally recognize that.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.420]  I know lots and lots of people, they do it on airplanes.
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:01.840]  If you're lucky enough to fly on an airline
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.400]  that has, you know, USB or power adapters,
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.440]  people charge their phone
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.400]  while they listen to music on the flight.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.800]  I know people do it at their desks.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.040]  People will charge their phone
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.000]  while they're listening to music on it.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.320]  You know, it's, I understand it,
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.340]  and I don't, if there's just one lightning port,
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:21.480]  and of course they're not going to put two lightning ports
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.760]  on the thing, how do you listen with lightning headphones?
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.520]  I mean, and that's the one idea
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.720]  that people were kicking around when the rumors were
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.740]  that the new iPhones were going to have
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:32.960]  the smart connector type thing on the back,
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:35.880]  that maybe there'd be like a Apple Watch style
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:39.440]  magnetic charger, but I don't know,
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.100]  that doesn't seem right.
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:43.640]  No, especially like, you know, we already got like,
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.800]  you know, as they ship more and more other things
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:50.040]  that charge via lightning, it's pretty clear like,
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.120]  we have now a world where lightning is like
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.200]  the universal Apple charger for all Apple's products,
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.960]  except the Watch, annoyingly, but everything else,
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.040]  it's like everything charges by lightning,
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.740]  and I don't see them throwing that away so soon.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.600]  Yeah, like the pencil charges by it,
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.640]  the rumor that, I forget if somebody
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:11.820]  just pulled this out of their ass,
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.880]  or if it was a real leak, that the AirPods
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.680]  would have like a little, some kind of little
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.440]  lightning thing that comes out or goes in.
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.840]  I don't know, Bluetooth, I'm lucky that I don't
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.400]  actually use earbuds or in-ear monitors,
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.640]  I just can't wear them, like pain-wise, I can't wear them.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.840]  Bluetooth is, you know, it's annoying
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.460]  for full-size headphones, but it's not that bad.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.640]  Bluetooth for earbuds has a whole bunch of challenges
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.580]  of like, well, where do you put the battery,
[01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.120]  and how do they connect to each other,
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:42.440]  and like there's all sorts of like weird hacks
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.220]  that people have devised, like well,
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:46.240]  you have this like thing behind your neck or something,
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.240]  you know, like there's always some kind of trick,
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:50.760]  but it's tricky to get Bluetooth into earbuds
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.920]  in a way that doesn't suck.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.800]  But you know, overall, like Bluetooth,
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.720]  like moving towards the world of Bluetooth headphones,
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.280]  you know, it's, in so many ways, it's worse.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.340]  Like, number one problem is, of course,
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.520]  this is one more thing you have to charge,
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.840]  and if you're traveling, that might mean
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.300]  one more cable to bring or something,
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:10.160]  and one more battery that could just die
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.780]  at inopportune times, and it's just kind of annoying.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:15.720]  They're also, they tend to be substantially more expensive
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.160]  than other headphones of similar quality and attributes,
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.680]  and it, Bluetooth is slightly unreliable.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.660]  Like, it works most of the time,
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.200]  but like every time I'm walking with my Bluetooth,
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.220]  you know, little portable headphones
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.220]  for walking and listening to podcasts,
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.600]  every time I have like a little clip out of the audio
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.760]  during some part of the walk, if I like turn,
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.960]  if I like put my hand in the wrong spot,
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.280]  like in my pocket or something,
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.620]  like it like blocks the signal just enough
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.160]  that oh, can't quite make it, I get a little static,
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.520]  then I gotta move my hand, like,
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:46.440]  and I've tested so many pairs of Bluetooth headphones,
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.280]  they all have that problem.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.520]  Like, it's always, some of them are better than others,
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.600]  but they all have that problem to some degree,
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.880]  and then there's the big problem of using,
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.960]  whatever headphones you come up with,
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.920]  Bluetooth and, lightning, this would actually
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.800]  be substantially worse, using the same headphones
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.640]  for multiple devices.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:04.920]  So suppose, like when I'm on a plane,
[01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.520]  I'm always switching my headphones
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:07.620]  to whatever device I'm using.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:09.840]  So if we're like, you know, taking off or whatever,
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.680]  I'm just gonna try to sleep,
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.360]  I'll have my iPhone in my pocket.
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.440]  But then if I'm gonna like take out my laptop
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.040]  or an iPad to try to get something done on the tray,
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.960]  I'm gonna switch the headphones to that.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.860]  And it, and you know, a lot of people,
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.860]  they use the same headphones between work and home
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:26.440]  at their work computer or at, or you know, work and iPod,
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.400]  like, excuse me, iPhone, iPods are ancient.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.000]  So, you know, with Bluetooth, like because of Bluetooth,
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.400]  you know, pairing and everything,
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.840]  it's just such a pain to share Bluetooth headphones
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.960]  between multiple devices that in practice,
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:42.840]  nobody really does it.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.720]  Like you can, like some of them have
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.120]  like a multiple pairing memory,
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.640]  but they're always weird and hard to use.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.640]  Effectively, Bluetooth headphones, you know,
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.200]  in practice, they just kind of get locked
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.440]  to their primary device.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.800]  So nobody ever really changes it.
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:56.040]  So that sucks.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.240]  Lightning would be even worse because yes,
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.960]  you could, you could swap lightning between like
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:02.180]  your iPhone and your iPad, but then you,
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.940]  what are you gonna do when you go to your Mac?
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.480]  Like you can't plug your lightning headphones into your Mac.
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.680]  And that seems crazy.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:11.780]  I mean, I threw it out there as a spit ball this week
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.880]  that what if that's the reason the MacBook Pros
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:14.720]  are being delayed,
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.320]  because they're gonna put a lightning port on them,
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.760]  just so that you can plug your headphones in.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.920]  But it doesn't, you know, in every other way,
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.120]  other than the idea that I would like to be able
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.200]  to use the headphones, the same headphones
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.560]  with my iPhone and my Mac,
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.680]  which is a very reasonable desire.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.840]  Other than that, it doesn't make any sense
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.740]  to put a lightning port on the Mac.
[01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.740]  But I, you know, I don't know, maybe?
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.240]  I don't, I mean, it doesn't seem, I wouldn't,
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.740]  I wouldn't faint if that was announced,
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.400]  but it doesn't seem right.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:48.020]  Again, the only thing that really makes sense is Bluetooth.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.640]  But like you said, Bluetooth sharing between devices
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.760]  is really weird.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:54.120]  You gotta like, I mean, it's just like click, click, click,
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.120]  or tap, tap, you know, settings, Bluetooth,
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.840]  unpair, pair, type this code.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.440]  Yeah, it's just, yeah, it's crappy.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.240]  And like, and on the Android side,
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.600]  they have this whole NFC system to make pairing
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:06.100]  faster and easier.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.180]  It's possible Apple could add that to the next iPhone.
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:10.180]  They already have the NFC antenna for Apple Pay.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.280]  I don't know much about NFC,
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.340]  but it's probably the same antenna.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.760]  So it's possible they could do something like that,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.160]  but honestly, I don't see that.
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.000]  I mean, I don't.
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.040]  It's hard to beat the pairing process
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.560]  of headphones as we know them.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.000]  Yeah, you plug them in.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.920]  And when it clicks, you're done.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.640]  Yeah, and then if you wanna, you know,
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.560]  if you wanna all of a sudden have the headphones
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:32.280]  be playing output from a different device,
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:33.120]  you know what you do?
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.160]  You just unplug it, and you plug it into the other device,
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.960]  and because they all have the same port.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.500]  Like, even the MacBook One has no other ports,
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.920]  except it has a headphone port.
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.480]  Like, that's the, besides the USB-C,
[01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.040]  that's like the one other port they deemed worthy
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.160]  of including on that computer was a headphone port.
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.840]  Like, that just kind of shows how ubiquitous
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.220]  and important and how compelling it is
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.360]  for this port to continue to exist.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.080]  So, ultimately though, if this thing about the iPhone
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:05.240]  is true, I think the world of lightning headphones
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.400]  is generally a terrible idea,
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.120]  and is probably not gonna be very healthy.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:11.960]  Yeah, but maybe.
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.120]  It's probably gonna be mostly adapters
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.960]  to regular headphones or Bluetooth.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:17.780]  Maybe though, it'll kickstart it,
[01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:20.240]  because it hasn't taken off to date, because why?
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.280]  Why would you bother getting lightning headphones
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.900]  when you can get regular headphone jack headphones
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.080]  that are, you know, have the same audio quality
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.040]  and they're cheaper?
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.480]  Right, by the way, I should point out too,
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.220]  I love this so much.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.360]  The headphones that are pictured in every article
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.200]  about lightning headphones on the Verge
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:41.040]  are the Audizay EL8 Titanium or Platinum or something.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.480]  They're $800 and they sound terrible.
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.040]  Just putting that out there.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.560]  They look really cool, and we're gonna have lots
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.680]  of lightning headphones that look really cool
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.000]  and cost a lot of money, but hopefully
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.860]  they'll sound better than the EL8.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:57.720]  Sorry, Audizay, there goes one sponsor
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.740]  I'm never gonna get, but.
[01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:02.320]  Let's dispel the notion that maybe,
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.880]  I've seen this kicked around,
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.840]  and I think it is total nonsense,
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.320]  never gonna happen, is that the solution,
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.100]  because one of the problems people have with lightning,
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.840]  the idea of using lightning as the port
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.960]  for wired headphones, is that now you're stuck
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.860]  with an Apple proprietary solution
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.360]  that has to get a licensing fee,
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.920]  has to meet Apple's approval,
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.880]  and therefore has to be more expensive
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:21.720]  than it would be otherwise,
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.720]  because whatever the licensing fee is,
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.120]  if it's even a penny, that means
[01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.000]  that the thing's gonna cost a penny more,
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.580]  and it's not gonna be a penny.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.880]  Right, well, but.
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:33.520]  The idea that people are, I've seen kicking about is,
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.040]  well, okay, well, if a headphone port
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:37.880]  should be open, and everybody likes having
[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.160]  an open standard, why not USB-C?
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.760]  Maybe that's the idea, is that the iPhone
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.640]  will switch to USB-C, and guess what?
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.260]  The headphone port aside, the iPhone
[01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:48.360]  is not going to switch to USB-C.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.280]  No, there's no chance of that.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.120]  No chance.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.280]  First of all, it's thicker than lightning.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:53.400]  Right, then that alone is a deal breaker,
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.280]  and I'll put it in the show notes, hopefully,
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.600]  but I got a good link.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.040]  Somebody did a really nice, precise diagram
[01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:02.240]  showing just how much thicker it is,
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.180]  and it actually would be pretty close
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.580]  to a gating factor already on the iPhone 6,
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.520]  and everybody knows Apple likes
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.200]  to make devices thinner over time.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.560]  So when you just eyeball them side by side,
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:15.920]  you can say, oh yeah, they're more or less the same,
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.200]  but when you get right down to it
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:21.500]  and start measuring the tenths of a millimeter,
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.120]  it's too big of a difference.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:23.960]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.320]  And strategically, Apple is not gonna give up
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.320]  their proprietary port that they've had
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.500]  on the iPhone all along for the non-proprietary port
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.300]  just so that they can have quote-unquote open headphones.
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.020]  Yeah, I mean, they couldn't possibly care less.
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:41.040]  So yeah, I mean, and the cost increase,
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.400]  I mean, headphones already, especially headphones
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.080]  that are targeted at smartphone use
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.640]  and would be the kind of thing
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.640]  that would be sold in an Apple store,
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.920]  like the price of the headphone has so little to do
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.000]  with the cost of its components in this market
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.600]  that that would not, like the cost of MFI certification
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.040]  would probably not be the reason
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.320]  why these headphones cost a lot.
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.160]  Right.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.860]  These headphones cost a lot because they know
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.240]  they're selling into a premium market
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.000]  that's based mostly on brand recognition
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.240]  and being sold in a high-end retail store.
[01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.880]  Like that is why these headphones cost what they do.
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.160]  Lightning headphones will be expensive,
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.200]  but it won't be because of the raw component
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.480]  cost increase, it'll be because
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.140]  of everything else about them.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.200]  So that's that.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.520]  You know, ultimately though, like I really do believe
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.240]  that we are heading towards a world of Apple pushing us,
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:34.480]  you know, assuming this is true,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.120]  the real push is gonna be towards Bluetooth.
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:39.240]  It's not gonna be towards the new cabling standard.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.460]  It's going to be Bluetooth because that, again,
[01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.960]  we're already moving there so much
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.160]  because the reality is, like, as a user,
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.420]  like look, I have a whole closet and a couple of drawers
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.000]  full of way better headphones
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.400]  than my little Bluetooth walking pair.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.520]  And yet, the little Bluetooth walking pair
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.320]  is the one I am using most often with my iPhone
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.320]  because even though it is worse in so many different ways,
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.160]  it's more complicated, it's more expensive,
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.360]  it needs to be charged, it's a little bit flaky
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.120]  with that connection when I move my hand worse,
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:13.040]  it sounds worse, like the sound quality is worse,
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.080]  so much about it is worse.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.280]  However, it is more compelling.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.640]  And if you look at, like, you know,
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.120]  worse but more compelling is like the theme
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.480]  of modern computing advances, like so many things.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.800]  We have, you know, just, we have given up
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.760]  reliability, simplicity, openness, cost,
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.080]  so, you know, so many, like, good attributes.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.720]  We've given those up for a new thing
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.840]  that is just, you know, nicer in some way
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.800]  or I want it more or it's just more compelling
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.640]  for some reason and that's how Bluetooth is.
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.480]  That's why, like, I don't know anybody
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.760]  who has started using Bluetooth headphones
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.000]  and then ever wanted to use wired headphones again.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.560]  Well, it's like Wi-Fi versus ethernet,
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.080]  worse but more compelling.
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:00.600]  Especially in the early years of Wi-Fi.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.640]  Yeah, I mean, Wi-Fi now is pretty decent.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.040]  It was really not so in the early years, but again.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.720]  And the speed difference was really, really dramatic
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.760]  in the early years.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.600]  Yeah.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.720]  You didn't even need to have a terrific
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:13.040]  internet connection and you could easily saturate
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:14.960]  your Wi-Fi connection and the ethernet
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.000]  would be the other way around.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.080]  Like, you couldn't buy an internet connection
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.360]  that would saturate, you know, even 100 base T.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.880]  Yeah, you know, Bluetooth will,
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.880]  whatever argument we can have about the headphone jack now,
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.800]  like, it will be worse not having it.
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.680]  It will suck not having it sometimes.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.280]  For some people, it'll be more than sometimes.
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:39.920]  But in general, like, we are better off if we can keep it.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.160]  But in general, the market is moving towards
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.520]  Bluetooth headphones and it is worse and that's okay.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:48.360]  What about latency?
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.560]  That's one thing that bothers me.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.640]  And I'm one of those weirdos.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.240]  I realize, it's like, I tell people this
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.120]  and they look at me and they think I'm joking.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.840]  But I generally run with key clicks on.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.960]  Like, when I'm typing on the iPhone keyboard,
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.240]  I like to hear the clicks.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:04.440]  But I can't, I mean, it's like, just the cognitive,
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:07.800]  trying to make sense of the lag
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.520]  when I have Bluetooth headphones on, it's like impossible.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.760]  I can't because it's hard to also ignore the fact
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.280]  that some pretty common tasks for people to do on phones
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.320]  include watching videos and playing games.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.760]  And both of those really suck
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.160]  if there's noticeable audio latency.
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.520]  Yeah, the video problem, they seem to have solved.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:28.640]  They seem, I don't notice any kind of lip sync problem.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.800]  That's really when you can tell with audio's off
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.320]  if it looks like lips aren't moving in sync.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.000]  And they've done something where I think that they can,
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.880]  you know, sort of like what Federighi was saying
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.520]  with the speed of light calculations
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.760]  with the, on stage last week, he said,
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.440]  where they can tell just how close the watch is
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:52.440]  to the MacBook that's being unlocked with that new feature.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.320]  They do something where the video is lagged
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.840]  by the exact same amount that the audio has to lag
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.280]  because of Bluetooth and it's in sync.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.280]  But games are like the keyboard,
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.000]  like, you know, all the beeps and boops and blops
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.520]  are a half second behind.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:10.560]  You know, but ultimately I think what's going to happen
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.520]  is we're just gonna deal with that.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.760]  Because like, I mean, one thing is like,
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.920]  I learned this when I tried to buy
[01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.360]  wireless digital microphones for our recording this year
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.840]  at WBC and that failed miserably.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.640]  If you're transmitting audio wirelessly,
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:27.360]  if you're doing it in like a pure analog sense,
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.160]  like the way, you know, old cordless mics worked
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.960]  and a lot of old cordless phones worked,
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.360]  you know, analog sucks in a lot of ways.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.680]  You know, you pick up static and everything.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.520]  But analog is basically latency free.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.760]  If you're doing it digitally,
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.080]  which is what Bluetooth is doing,
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.200]  having, you know, transmitting audio digitally wirelessly
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.720]  from some device in your hand to headphones on your head
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.760]  and then having those headphones
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.080]  and convert that audio digitally into the analog sounds,
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.200]  just because of the nature of digital transmission
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.160]  of, you know, there's like buffers
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.440]  in different places and everything,
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:58.040]  there's always going to be some degree of latency.
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.920]  And even the best latency,
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.560]  like even the lowest we've managed to get it
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.600]  as an industry, is still noticeable
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.880]  for things like lip syncing lining up
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.440]  and for, you know, things like that.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.680]  And that's like the best stuff.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.840]  Most of what you're getting in Bluetooth headphones
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.480]  is not top notch equipment.
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.360]  You know, it's not like the best of the best.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.320]  It's consumer grade, you know, cheapo stuff.
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.120]  And so you're never going to get
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.360]  digital transmission of sound
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.440]  from a phone to your headphones that is latency free.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.000]  It's, I don't think we know how to do that as like a science.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:30.840]  Right.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.160]  So I think this is going to be one of those things
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.520]  where it's just always going to be worse
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.440]  and we will just, as a society,
[01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:39.800]  we will just move to, well,
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.320]  I guess we just won't play games with headphones on.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.520]  Or I guess we just won't,
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.440]  we'll turn off our keyboard sounds or something.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.280]  I mean. Right.
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.000]  Because, again, like the advantages,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.520]  like once you get used to using Bluetooth headphones,
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.800]  using a wire feels barbaric.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.520]  Like it, and because I know,
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.040]  whenever I travel on a plane,
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.440]  my Bluetooth ones suck on a plane
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:00.480]  because they're small and they don't isolate.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:03.080]  So I usually bring a nicer pair
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.240]  of wired headphones for planes.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.360]  And it just feels so weird to have this like wire
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.000]  going down my side into my pocket.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.480]  Like once you're not used to that,
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.240]  getting it again is crazy.
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:16.880]  Once I got used to having the like track forward,
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.520]  track back volume controls on the ear cup as buttons
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:21.720]  on my Bluetooth pair,
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.040]  rather than having the clicker and have,
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:25.160]  all right, click twice for four,
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.280]  click three times for back, you know,
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.200]  and try to do like, once again,
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.480]  once you get used to the convenience of it,
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.120]  it really is so much better
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.680]  that you tolerate all the crap about Bluetooth.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.920]  Yeah, I got them for running,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.280]  for listening to podcasts and,
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.840]  well, you're really just listening to podcasts while I run.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.040]  And the tethered,
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.760]  being tethered to the headphones always bothered me.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:49.400]  It never once figured out.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.520]  I tried all sorts of stuff, holding the phone,
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.360]  an armband, putting it in a pocket.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.000]  I tried everything and no matter what,
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.560]  that the wire gets in your way.
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.400]  That's why I bought it.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.320]  But then I, this was like, I don't know,
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.520]  nine months ago, something like that,
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:06.640]  when I got these, the Beats ones.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.800]  But the thing I noticed was over the winter,
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.120]  how nice it was in the East Coast winter
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:13.560]  when I could wear them all bundled up with a coat
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.840]  and still have my phone in the pocket
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:18.680]  because with a winter coat on and a hat
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.520]  and stuff like that,
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.720]  it was just another type of mess, having a cable.
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.480]  Try to like sneak it through different layers.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.720]  Like sneak it through the button, you know,
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.280]  it's almost like when you wire yourself up with a lav mic.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.120]  Exactly.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.440]  And then, you know, trying to get it out, it's even worse.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:36.400]  All right, here's one last topic on the headphone thing
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.800]  and the headphone port being gone
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:42.200]  that I have in my notes is the waterproofing angle.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.600]  See, that's kind of a bad one
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.800]  because like there are already phones out there
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:46.640]  that other people make
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.800]  that have headphone ports and are waterproof.
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.640]  And that's, I,
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:55.640]  that's true.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.360]  I wonder, I wonder if it would be
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:00.680]  just part of the story though, you know,
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.080]  and then there's an angle
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:03.480]  where maybe it's a little bit of BS
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.240]  because hey, well, okay,
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.800]  you're saying that the phone is water resistant now
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:11.560]  and one of the reasons is you got rid of this ancient,
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:13.880]  you know, headphone port,
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.160]  but there's these other phones that are water resistant
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.000]  and they have it.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.320]  Do the other phones that have it,
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.080]  do they make you plug it up with like a little rubber cover
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:24.600]  or are they just like, nope, you can just?
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:25.520]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.360]  I think that the-
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.400]  You assume I've ever seen an Android phone.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.720]  Well, there's a funny commercial.
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.800]  It's so, it's obnoxious,
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.520]  but there's like a funny commercial
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.360]  or a series of commercials for Samsung
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360]  where there's a guy who's,
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.840]  I think I'm supposed to know who he is.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:40.120]  I think he's like a rap star,
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.800]  but I don't know who he is.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.800]  And he's got a new Samsung,
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:46.440]  whatever top of the line Galaxy Edge or whatever,
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.480]  and he's just pouring champagne on it.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.880]  And he comes into a convenience store
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.720]  and he asks the guy,
[01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:53.960]  and he's pouring champagne on his phone
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.120]  while he comes into the store.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.880]  And he says, where's your champagne?
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.000]  And the guy points back there and the bottle's empty
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:00.880]  and he throws it away
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.160]  and he goes buy a new bottle of champagne,
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.000]  pops the cork,
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.600]  and then just starts pouring it on his phone again.
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:08.360]  And that's the end of the commercial.
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.200]  I laugh.
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:10.280]  What a bizarre company that is.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.000]  It is, but it is such an obnoxious commercial.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.280]  They're very good at that.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.840]  Like, can you even imagine if Apple had a commercial
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.760]  that just showed somebody wasting two bottles of champagne
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.200]  to pour on their phone?
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.960]  But I can only presume that the Samsung one
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.680]  must be waterproof with a headphone jack.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.320]  I think it is, yeah, from what I've heard.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.160]  I don't know the details,
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.960]  but all I know is that these phones exist, right?
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  So there are reasons that Apple could say on stage
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.200]  why they did this,
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.680]  but if you look down the list of reasons
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.000]  why they might do this,
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.040]  the better audio, the thickness, the waterproofing,
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.040]  all of these are not strong reasons
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.880]  because either they are totally unnecessary
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.400]  or there's enough ways around that
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.360]  or enough asterisks on it that it's not really that valid.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.160]  So if you look at like,
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.000]  there are some cynical reasons
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.120]  why Apple would want to do this.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.040]  I mean, they would stand to make more money.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.300]  They would save on component costs.
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.040]  They would save on warranty repair stuff
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.000]  when they have to pull lint out of people's headphone jacks
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.400]  and fix the ones that jam up,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.280]  which, by the way, again,
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.160]  is also a problem with Lightning ports.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.440]  So there are lots of reasons why Apple wanted to do this.
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  I mean, it would cause a wave of headphone upgrades
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:25.460]  and Apple sells a lot of their own headphones
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.940]  with their name and Beats's name on them.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.780]  In addition, many of those headphones upgrades
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.200]  would apply at the point of sale.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.340]  When you buy your iPhone,
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:37.620]  hey, why not also treat yourself to this $200 pair of Beats
[01:42:37.620 --> 01:42:39.200]  because you're gonna need new headphones with this phone.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.520]  So that would help their attachment sale rate
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.780]  with sale of new iPhones.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.460]  It's like Apple would stand to make
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.320]  quite a lot of additional money by doing this.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.860]  I hope that's not the reason.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:52.440]  That probably isn't the reason, but I bet that's a reason.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.440]  What if they do ship a pair of white in-ear just pods
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:01.520]  with the phone, you just get them with the phone,
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.800]  wireless Bluetooth things that come with the phone,
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:08.460]  but then they also have a whole lineup
[01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:10.360]  of new Beats stuff ready to go,
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.660]  like the upsell is for Beats.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.880]  That's possible, but I think it's very unlikely.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.500]  I think it's way more likely what we said earlier
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.320]  that what you get in the box is either nothing,
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:21.080]  like maybe they will just decide, you know what,
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.540]  we don't need to ship headphones in the box anymore.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.040]  You can buy any of the things.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.080]  We're doing you a favor.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.360]  We're offering you the choice, all right?
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.560]  So maybe that's the angle.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:30.320]  Or more likely, they ship wired
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.600]  Lightning headphones in the box,
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.120]  and it's just a wired Lightning version
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.440]  of the ones they ship now.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:36.400]  That's way more likely, I think.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.760]  And it's possible that the way that,
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.600]  what's that Japanese rumor site?
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.160]  Like, Oktober or something?
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:47.200]  I don't know, I don't know how to pronounce Japanese words.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:48.760]  I will just embarrass myself, unfortunately.
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:51.240]  But they reported months ago
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:52.140]  when we first started talking about this
[01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.600]  that the next iPhone would have a special,
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.080]  like some extra pins on the Lightning port,
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:57.920]  and special circuitry inside of it.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.160]  It would actually send analog audio out over the port
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.660]  to be able to power passive devices
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:06.240]  that don't have a built-in DAC and AMP,
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.220]  and that would be how the next cheap Apple earbuds
[01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:10.920]  would receive the audio.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.840]  So it's physically over the Lightning port,
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  but they're receiving analog audio.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:16.480]  That seems very plausible to me.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.520]  I said it even back then.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.840]  That sounds extremely likely to be
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.200]  how they solve this problem for their own earbuds.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.900]  And if they wanted to offer a dongle,
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:26.640]  they could do one very cheaply,
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.240]  and it could be a very simple device
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:29.800]  if they have that kind of setup.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.520]  Yes, that sounds possible.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.780]  And that's one of the reasons I've seen people toss out,
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:35.700]  hey, maybe they'll switch the iPhone to USB-C
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:38.120]  because I think part of the official USB-C
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:43.040]  since SPAC is analog audio passed through
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.520]  on one of the pins or something like that.
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.200]  I could be wrong, but.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.040]  Probably.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.220]  And Lightning doesn't have that.
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:50.620]  But the difference is that Apple can change Lightning
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:51.640]  whenever it wants to.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.120]  Exactly, and they can so easily say like,
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.040]  well, we didn't need this part of the Lightning port
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.900]  on any previous phone because they all had headphone jacks.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.040]  Now this one, we've helped everyone out.
[01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.800]  So I think to me, I guess my final for now comment
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.920]  on the headphone jack thing is like,
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.400]  is there any reason I can come up with
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.640]  why this would be a positive thing for customers?
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:14.920]  It's obviously good for Apple.
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.080]  Why is it good for customers?
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:17.940]  And I can come up with one reason.
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.840]  And that would be if they replace the space
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:24.660]  used by the headphone jack with another speaker.
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:28.040]  And if by doing this, they can dramatically improve
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.520]  the quality of the built-in speaker output of the iPhone.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.480]  Because as I learn more about how people use iPhones,
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:39.180]  if you look like, so I do my own analytics in Overcast
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.680]  of like, what is the current output device type?
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:46.080]  And the audio API is pretty coarse grained on that,
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.200]  but it can tell you whether it's internal speaker
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.920]  or wired headphones or Bluetooth or AirPlay.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.080]  And that helps me to figure out like,
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:54.160]  okay, well, what kind of features do I work on next?
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.000]  Basically, that's one of the reasons
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.520]  why I did the speaker optimized voice boost
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:46:01.340]  in a recent version, because I learned that
[01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:04.400]  tons of people use the iPhone built-in speaker.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.440]  And I always have, but I thought I was just like,
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.480]  you know, a weird freak who worked at home.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:09.760]  I didn't know anyone else did,
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.660]  but it turns out tons of people use the iPhone speaker
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.000]  all the time, even though it slaughters your battery.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.800]  But it doesn't matter, everyone does it anyway.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.600]  And a lot of people do it like in cars,
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:20.880]  it's to play music from their phone in their car
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.840]  that they don't have a better connection to.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.560]  A lot of people do it around the house.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.100]  I mean, it's just, it's so common.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.200]  So, and that's one of the reasons
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.020]  why I ended up buying the new Baby Pro,
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.040]  the new 9.7 inch iPad, because.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.480]  It sounds so much better.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.440]  Oh my god, it's night and day, I mean.
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:37.280]  It's unbelievable.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.060]  And like, I use it as like a kitchen speaker
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.000]  most of the time, you know, plus like a couch iPad,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.940]  and oh my god, it's massively different.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:46.960]  So what if they were able to do a large improvement
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.960]  to the internal speaker of the iPhone
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:51.540]  by replacing the headphone jack with a second speaker?
[01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:52.380]  Now.
[01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:55.740]  I like your thinking, that sounds compelling to me.
[01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:58.960]  The only, my only hesitation on that is that
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.760]  the reason they were able to do it with the iPad
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:03.760]  is, you know, when you look at like how you're allocating
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.120]  space inside of a computer device these days,
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.380]  these mobile, modern, ultra thin, awesome devices.
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.060]  You like to think, oh well, you know,
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.180]  figure out what components you need
[01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:15.060]  and then fill the rest of the space with battery.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:17.760]  The problem is batteries are really heavy.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.900]  So my theory is that, you know, we talk about Apple
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.500]  pushing everything to be super thin and everything,
[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:24.700]  and in some ways that goes too far,
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.100]  like the MacBook One keyboard,
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.980]  but I think what they really are doing
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.300]  is they're trying to target a weight goal,
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.900]  and the weight goal is limited by how much battery
[01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:37.500]  you're willing to carry, like how much battery
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.460]  you're willing to devote weight to,
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.740]  and then you can just kind of shrink the enclosure
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.900]  around that and be like, what's the smallest enclosure
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.420]  we can make that fits only this amount of battery
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:48.180]  and nothing else, you know?
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.960]  And with the iPad, they've kind of reached this point
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.580]  where, well the enclosure is this thin, flat thing,
[01:47:54.580 --> 01:47:58.060]  and they basically can't make it a lot thinner
[01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.080]  and keeping the same amount of battery
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.060]  and still have it be a flat back.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.760]  Like they'd have to like kind of make it like a bulge
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:05.620]  where the battery sticks out,
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:07.460]  kind of like their battery case for the phone,
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:09.380]  or you know, something like that, that would look dumb.
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:12.260]  So basically with the iPad, because of this like
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.980]  battery weight trade-off, they end up having
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:17.340]  a lot of extra space in the case.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:20.860]  So they spent that extra space on big speaker cavities
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.340]  to like tunnel the sound and make it sound
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:24.660]  better and everything.
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:28.740]  On the phone, they don't have that kind of volume to spare.
[01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:30.920]  So they might get some of it with the headphone jack
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.480]  removal, and that might be enough to just basically
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:35.840]  like double the speaker we have now, which would help,
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:36.960]  that would be nice.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.500]  But in order to make a really big improvement,
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:41.380]  I feel like they would have to do like one of those
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:43.380]  four speaker arrangements, like they have on the iPad,
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:44.980]  or like have any phones on that?
[01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:46.260]  Probably some Android phones on that.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.340]  Like to have like a speaker on every corner, basically,
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.620]  instead of just the bottom half.
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.260]  I don't think they would have to do that,
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.660]  because I think everybody holds the phone.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.980]  Although I guess when you watch video,
[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:57.460]  it's always, it is a little weird that the sound's
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.300]  only coming out of one side.
[01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.860]  Yeah, I mean, if they did that, it would be great.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:02.700]  But I just don't think they have enough space.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.340]  I don't think they have enough free volume
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.260]  inside the phone to do that.
[01:49:06.260 --> 01:49:09.900]  It also raises the question of the idea of the notion of,
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.700]  hey, let's make the speakers bottom, you know,
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.940]  let's use the space on the bottom for the speakers,
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.860]  do it on both sides, you could have stereo.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:18.620]  Well, then why not put the headphone back at the top
[01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:20.420]  where it used to be for years?
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:21.700]  Right.
[01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:24.300]  Yeah, I mean, I don't, that's the thing.
[01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:28.420]  My most plausible, most optimistic version of this,
[01:49:28.420 --> 01:49:29.960]  well, first of all, my most optimistic version
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:31.300]  is that the headphone jack doesn't go away.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:34.060]  But if it's gonna go away, my most optimistic version
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:36.940]  of this that is plausible is that they're just gonna put
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:38.940]  a second speaker there that's roughly as good
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.020]  as the one we have now, or maybe a little bit better.
[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:43.760]  And that will still be a big improvement to the speaker,
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:46.720]  but not as big of an improvement as we have on the iPad.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:49.180]  I enjoy that there's 300,000 people who've signed
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:51.500]  a petition not to do this.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:52.340]  Really?
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:53.180]  Yeah.
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.100]  That's amazing.
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.740]  That'll help.
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.060]  Well, it's already done.
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:57.900]  If it's true.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.460]  I know, I just think it's too late.
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:00.300]  It's already done.
[01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.900]  It's getting to the point where I think it's too late
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.940]  to change next year's iPhone, let alone this year's.
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:07.060]  That's the thing people do not understand.
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:10.420]  This is how Apple ships 70 million iPhones
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.620]  in the first quarter.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.780]  It's because the production ramp up is months in advance.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:15.940]  Yeah, I mean, they're probably already
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:18.060]  being manufactured right now.
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:19.220]  It is this year's model.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.780]  All this speculation, it is still,
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:24.160]  I'm damn curious to hear them tell me why.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.220]  I can't wait.
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:28.060]  But I do know that, and again, it could make mistakes.
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.300]  Apple does make big mistakes sometimes,
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:31.700]  and this could be one.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:39.660]  But in general, the company has a very strong,
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.220]  I don't know what you would call it, like a rule,
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.260]  but just a policy.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:44.060]  It's just the way they work is they don't
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:45.580]  make changes for change's sake.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.820]  They only make changes if the change is for the better.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:51.020]  Now, the question is better for whom?
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.380]  I mean, and sometimes changes are what's better for Apple.
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:57.380]  I would maybe argue the force-touch trackpad
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:59.700]  on all the computers that aren't the MacBook One where
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:02.620]  the thinness isn't necessary is maybe on the wrong side
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.340]  of that.
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:07.580]  Can I just tell you, we disagree on that because I have,
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:12.540]  my regular 13-inch MacBook Pro has the old physically clicky
[01:51:12.540 --> 01:51:13.380]  one.
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:15.100]  I love the force-touch one.
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.540]  I like it so much that I would almost,
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:19.020]  it would be such a waste of money,
[01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.940]  but I almost want to get a new MacBook Pro just
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.140]  to get the force-touch trackpad.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.340]  I like it that much better.
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:24.860]  I really do.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:28.400]  I will say, though, that the one on the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.300]  which would be, I guess, the one you'd probably be getting.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:33.380]  Without question, that's the one I would be getting.
[01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:36.580]  Yeah, that one is the best one that I've felt.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.380]  Like, a lot of people don't realize
[01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.800]  that every force-touch trackpad feels a little bit different
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:42.620]  because they're all like different sizes, slightly
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:43.900]  different components, I think.
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:45.660]  The one on the MacBook One is the worst.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:47.500]  It is, I mean, just like everything else
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.940]  on the MacBook One, it's like, you know, horrible for input,
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.540]  but really great for portability.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:53.900]  So it's fine.
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:56.000]  The desktop one, which I actually have one.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.940]  I use it as my left-hand pointing thing
[01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.860]  for like when I'm scrubbing through Logic Project
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.220]  when editing podcasts.
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:03.140]  The desktop one is decent.
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:05.180]  The 15-inch one is decent.
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:08.980]  The 13-inch MacBook Pro one is actually pretty good.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:12.540]  None of them I would call great, but the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:13.820]  I would say, feels the best.
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:18.060]  But honestly, I dislike the force-touch so much
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:20.840]  that I'm just converting myself to be a tap-to-click person,
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.580]  which I hate, but I hate it less.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:28.100]  Hmm, anything else on the headphone port?
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:28.980]  I think that's it.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.380]  All right, we're not going to make this two-hour mark,
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.100]  because we just crossed it.
[01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:32.780]  We just crossed it.
[01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:33.740]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:35.080]  I have another speaker to thank.
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:36.700]  It is a new speaker.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.620]  Sponsor.
[01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:38.980]  A new, or sponsor, sorry.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:40.060]  I'd love to get a new speaker this phone.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:41.180]  We get a new speaker, too.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:42.460]  I've got speakers on the mind.
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:46.940]  Our new sponsor is Ministry of Supply.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:49.540]  As humans, we sweat, right?
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:50.300]  Everybody does.
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:52.460]  Nobody talks about it, but you sweat.
[01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:53.460]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.860]  Very rarely does sweating take place at convenient times.
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:52:59.980]  Gym clothes can handle it, but the clothes we wear to work,
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:02.180]  or at least that most people wear to work,
[01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.780]  AKA a majority of the day, every day, do nothing to help.
[01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.540]  They're stiff and restricting, and they only
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:08.580]  add to the problem.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.940]  They make you sweat even more.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.740]  Ministry Supply has set out to fix this.
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:17.940]  Their brand combines performance technology and tailored design
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:20.340]  to make men's work wear that's actually
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.100]  comfortable and capable.
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.900]  So it's like they're taking the fabrics and technology
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:30.340]  of modern gym wear and applying it to work wear.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:32.100]  They have something, for example,
[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:35.780]  they have something called the Aviator II suit, whole suit.
[01:53:35.780 --> 01:53:38.780]  It's so stretchy and breathable that people have actually
[01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:40.460]  run marathons in it.
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:43.420]  That sounds goofy to me, but it's an example
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:49.300]  of just how stretchable, comfortable their clothes are.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:53.220]  Their co-founder set the Guinness Book of World Records
[01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:57.380]  for the fastest half marathon run in a suit that
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:59.580]  was wearing the Aviator II.
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:02.940]  Here's another example, the Apollo dress shirt.
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:06.020]  It has NASA-invented fibers that regulate body temperature
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:07.460]  based on your surroundings.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.260]  It'll keep you warm when it's cool.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:11.420]  It'll keep you cool when it's warm.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:13.020]  Really, really great stuff.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.340]  Very, very stylish.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.540]  I've checked out the website.
[01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:16.980]  This is all sorts of great stuff.
[01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:19.040]  Very, very cool clothes.
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:20.460]  And it's all machine washable.
[01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:22.540]  You're no longer a slave to the dry cleaner.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.420]  You don't have to take everything
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:24.820]  to get dry cleaned in iron or whatever.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.460]  You could just throw it right in the washing machine
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.460]  like regular clothes.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.660]  So where do you go to find out more?
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:33.860]  Advanced technology, great fibers, great comfort,
[01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:37.860]  combined with really, really great, stylish, very cool
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:38.660]  clothes.
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:43.580]  Go to ministryofsupply.com slash talk show.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:47.340]  Ministryofsupplies.com slash talk show.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:48.860]  And remember that.
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.380]  Use that URL or just remember the code talk show,
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:55.260]  and you will save 15% off your first purchase.
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:57.980]  They even have retail stores in Boston and San Francisco
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:59.740]  and coming soon, Washington DC.
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:02.100]  So if you're in Boston or San Francisco or soon,
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:04.340]  Washington DC, you can just go to the retail store
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.140]  and check them out.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.060]  And if you mention the podcast code there,
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:08.860]  just mention the code talk show, you'll
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:10.580]  save 15% off right in the store.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:14.180]  So my thanks to Ministry of Supply, brand new sponsor.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:14.980]  Go check them out.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:16.740]  Get some new clothes.
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:18.820]  What else is on our agenda before we sign off?
[01:55:18.820 --> 01:55:19.980]  We're almost done, right?
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.020]  I mean, there were only four or five more topics
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.500]  that you had that were giant, like the entire conference
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:28.660]  or whole platforms, like iOS and watchOS and tvOS.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:32.220]  You know what, the watchOS thing is so fascinating to me,
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:35.060]  because I just linked to a thing today where David Sparks.
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.660]  So the hiccup with upgrading to watchOS 3.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:41.180]  I would, if I could just upgrade my watch to watchOS 3,
[01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:42.460]  I would do it in a heartbeat.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:47.820]  Because I don't really, I have so many issues with watchOS 2
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:50.900]  that watchOS 3 exactly tackles.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:52.500]  I would, betas and all.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.460]  And I, you know, if my watch gets stuck,
[01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:56.140]  it gets stuck or whatever.
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:56.660]  That's fine.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.660]  I could totally live with that.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.100]  But the problem is you can't upgrade to watchOS 3
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.660]  unless the paired iPhone you have it with is upgraded to iOS
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:03.140]  10.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:04.660]  And I understand why that is.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:05.780]  It makes a lot of sense.
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:08.660]  But I am definitely not ready to upgrade my daily iPhone
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:12.260]  to iOS 10, and probably won't be until later in the summer.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:15.860]  Yeah, I mean, like typically, like I think for regular people,
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:18.740]  the best advice is just don't use the betas.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:20.500]  But if you insist on using the betas,
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:24.180]  you know, wait until at least like public beta 2 or so.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:26.820]  And for like people who want to write about it
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.260]  and talk about it or developers, I
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.540]  think a good rule of thumb is roughly beta 3 of the developer
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:35.300]  side, which roughly correlates to beta 1 of the public side
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:35.780]  usually.
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:38.180]  Right, and summer just is like the worst time of year
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:42.100]  for me to like take risks with my phone because we're
[01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:44.180]  traveling, we're going on vacations,
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:46.460]  and just going away for weekends to see family and stuff.
[01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:47.460]  We just are out more.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:50.580]  And so I rely on my phone more in the summer
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:51.620]  than any other time.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:54.300]  Like if it was like time shifted by six months
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:57.100]  and we got like the betas in September,
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:58.380]  I'd probably put it on my phone.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.840]  Still wouldn't put the first one on,
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.580]  but I definitely would wait and listen
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:04.660]  to what everybody says about developer beta 2
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:06.100]  and probably go from there.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.500]  But I can't do it in the summer.
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:10.420]  But anyway, David Sparks bravely did.
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:15.660]  And really just had nothing, you know, it's true.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.900]  I mean, effectively what Apple said in the keynote.
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:21.820]  Because I was really skeptical, honestly, watching the keynote.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:22.940]  Oh, I think we all were.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:25.180]  I mean, like super skeptical to the point
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:27.300]  where I was sitting with Ben Thompson
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:29.980]  and I was like, if he's full of shit,
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:32.660]  this is going to be so much worse.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.920]  But you know, I got to play with them in hands on
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.500]  and they were every bit as fast as promised.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.740]  And now that people, brave people in the real world
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:43.820]  are trying it, they can vouch that what Apple said is true.
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:48.540]  It has enough RAM to keep half a dozen apps suspended
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:51.900]  in memory, which makes them instant.
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:54.620]  When you switch back to them, they're right there instantly.
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:56.540]  And the background updates, this is
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:58.700]  why it requires iOS 10 on your paired iPhone.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:02.220]  The background updates really do update in the background.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:04.620]  Yeah, and there's a lot of things
[01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:07.300]  that you still can't do in real time.
[01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:11.460]  Or there's still a lot of limits to conserve power and stuff.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.100]  But it's substantially different and way better
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:16.220]  than how it was before.
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:20.100]  And by the way, to help people not feel too bad
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:22.700]  that they can't run this yet, or they shouldn't run this yet
[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.540]  on their main phone and watch, keep
[01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.100]  in mind that a lot of these benefits
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:27.900]  you're not really going to see as a user
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:30.220]  until the apps can be updated for it, which can't
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.780]  happen until the release.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:34.900]  So you can have your dock full of Apple's apps,
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.940]  but you're not going to have any of those benefits
[01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:39.460]  for third-party apps unless you're on their beta, maybe.
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:41.380]  But I don't even know if we can send out test flight
[01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.340]  builds for iOS 10 yet.
[01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:43.620]  I don't even know.
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:44.660]  Yeah, I don't know either.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:46.340]  But it's going to be a while if we can.
[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:47.540]  It's going to be probably later in the summer
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.700]  if that when that happens.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.580]  And then any app you're not in the beta for,
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:53.980]  you literally can't use the watchOS 3 enhancements
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:57.660]  to that app until October or whenever it's released.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:00.260]  It's at a zoom out and at a high level,
[01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.060]  it's interesting to me in a couple of ways.
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:04.580]  And one is that, especially with iOS,
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:06.500]  and watchOS is a variant of iOS, so I
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:09.380]  think it qualifies, Apple has, for years,
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:14.460]  had the knock against it that older devices upgraded
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:16.980]  to the new OS instantly gets lower,
[01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:20.260]  to the point where there was the Catherine Ramble article
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.820]  in the New York Times, of all places,
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:23.860]  that was accusing them of doing it deliberately
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:25.500]  to spur upgrade sales.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:27.140]  I mean, that's something people believe.
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:27.780]  And there is.
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.780]  Your times really come downhill recently, huh?
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.300]  For some people, there are.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.740]  And some of that is actually true.
[01:59:33.740 --> 01:59:35.380]  I don't think it was ever deliberate.
[01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.100]  I really don't.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.540]  It's antithetical to Apple, and most of the people
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:40.180]  I know at Apple who are engineers,
[01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:42.020]  if they were told to do something like that,
[01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:42.680]  they would quit.
[01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:44.500]  They would actually quit their jobs
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:47.700]  rather than purposefully make an upgrade run slower
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.940]  on a certain device.
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:51.060]  The problem is more that they didn't
[01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:53.740]  spend enough time optimizing it because everybody
[01:59:53.740 --> 01:59:55.340]  who was working on the new version of iOS
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.420]  was using the latest and greatest hardware.
[01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:59.180]  And then at the end, it's like, well, quick,
[01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:04.260]  try to make this run fast on an iPad Mini 2.
[02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:05.460]  Just turn off some stuff.
[02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:06.660]  It'll be fine.
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.700]  I don't know, dial down the animation.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.980]  Well, it's time to ship.
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.300]  Here it is.
[02:00:12.300 --> 02:00:13.580]  I don't think it was purposeful.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.220]  I really don't.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.940]  But it was true that there have been versions of iOS
[02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:21.260]  that come out for older devices, and it does make them slow.
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:23.100]  And it's so funny that with this one,
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.460]  it is going to make your year-old watch faster.
[02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:28.940]  And way faster.
[02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:33.060]  Right, like noticeably faster.
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:36.900]  I haven't spent a day using it because I don't have it.
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:38.860]  But in the hands-on area for the press
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:41.300]  that I got to play with it, it really
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.860]  feels like a new hardware.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.300]  It's really kind of hard to believe
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:48.100]  that this is the same hardware as the old one.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:53.580]  Yeah, I got to play with it with Underscore David Smith's
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:57.620]  watch, a friend of the show, my friend Underscore David Smith.
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:00:59.860]  Because he's a big watchOS developer.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:01.420]  He has a good bunch of watch apps.
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:03.580]  And so he had, of course, because he's incredibly
[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.260]  productive and embarrasses all of us,
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:08.900]  he had already built like two of his apps for the watch
[02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:11.260]  and already had the complications installed.
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.180]  So he was showing me.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:14.180]  This was on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:16.980]  You'd see like an amazing time.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.580]  It blows me away.
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:21.020]  Yeah, and I got to play with it.
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:23.420]  He was showing me on his, of course, he had two watches.
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:27.500]  He had a second one to run the beta on because he's amazing.
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:31.260]  And it really is real.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.620]  It wasn't just PR.
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:35.100]  It wasn't just a presentation.
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:37.660]  The gains are real.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.220]  I, too, was just skeptical.
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:40.260]  I was like, oh, come on.
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:42.580]  There's no way it's going to be that fast in reality.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.700]  And it really is that fast in reality.
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:44.620]  Like it's not perfect.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.100]  Some of the animations still skip a little bit here
[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:47.820]  and there.
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.220]  It's still very slow hardware.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:54.340]  But it just seems like it was being used very poorly
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.980]  in watchOS 1 and 2.
[02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:59.700]  The hardware that's there, it's not as bad as it seemed.
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:02.940]  It's still very slow and very rudimentary hardware.
[02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:06.380]  But the software was seemingly making a lot of bad life
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:07.100]  choices before.
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:09.660]  And now they've really had a lot of time.
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.740]  And I've been kind of cool on the watch in recent months.
[02:02:14.740 --> 02:02:17.180]  And I don't really wear it anymore.
[02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.820]  But this is a huge update.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:22.980]  This is a way bigger update.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:24.700]  And I'm way more impressed by it than I
[02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:27.260]  thought I would be with whatever watchOS 3 turned out
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.380]  to be this summer.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:30.300]  I was not expecting this big of an update
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.340]  and this big of a change.
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:35.100]  And for them to reconsider and rethink
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:37.820]  some of the design of the watch software environment
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:39.700]  and to get rid of the stupid friend circle
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:41.100]  or at least move it somewhere else
[02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:44.260]  and to get rid of glances and to unify apps with glances
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:46.540]  and to make all that stuff.
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:49.380]  I've been thinking for a while like some of these things
[02:02:49.380 --> 02:02:50.260]  would be nice to do.
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:52.020]  But they're not going to do it because they already
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.540]  built this whole thing and it's too late.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.180]  And it turns out it wasn't too late.
[02:02:55.180 --> 02:02:56.460]  And they changed their mind because they
[02:02:56.460 --> 02:02:58.100]  saw how things were actually used.
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:59.660]  And they saw ways to make it better.
[02:02:59.660 --> 02:03:01.400]  And that's great.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.740]  And as a developer, I'm going to make Overcast
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.540]  for the watch at some point soon.
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:08.700]  I don't know if I'll make it in time for day one,
[02:03:08.700 --> 02:03:09.860]  but I'm going to try.
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:13.180]  Because my old watch app, based on watch kit one,
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:14.220]  it was just terrible.
[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.380]  It was just too slow, too unreliable.
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:18.300]  And I didn't upgrade it to watchOS 2
[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:21.300]  because it was going to be a ton of work.
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:23.540]  WatchOS 2 was not too different for users,
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:25.580]  but it was very different for developers.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:28.060]  So it was going to be a ton of work to do.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:30.340]  And the gains just were not really there.
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:32.740]  So I decided not to do it and to just wait and see
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:34.380]  what OS 3 brought.
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.980]  And I'm sure that I did because OS 3
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.300]  is a major, major upgrade for users and developers.
[02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.980]  And now it's possible to actually make decent apps.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.180]  Like before, even the best app you
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:47.340]  could make for watchOS 1 and 2, it
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:49.740]  was pretty mediocre to actually use.
[02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:53.060]  Now it's actually possible to make good, compelling apps
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:53.660]  for the watch.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:55.740]  And it's still not easy, and there's still plenty
[02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:56.860]  of limitations.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:59.100]  But it's at least possible, and there's
[02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:00.460]  good stuff to be done there.
[02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:02.460]  I can't think of anything else to compare it to,
[02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:04.380]  except maybe when Mac OS 10 first came out.
[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:06.180]  And I know this predates you as a Mac user.
[02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:11.980]  But Mac OS 10.0 was so dreadfully slow.
[02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:13.340]  It was everything.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:16.860]  I mean, just clicking on a menu and having the menu dropdown
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.940]  was slow.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:22.220]  Because what Aqua was doing, what the user interface was
[02:04:22.220 --> 02:04:27.660]  doing was so far ahead of the hardware that it was just slow.
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:31.460]  And what made that so painful was
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.940]  one thing that was not a problem with the classic Mac OS
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:38.540]  was, for lack of a better word, snappiness.
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:40.740]  The UI, there were lots of technical problems
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:44.380]  with the old Mac OS, but it was very snappy.
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:46.380]  And part of that was simply because it was so far
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:50.060]  behind the hardware, because the problems with the OS
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:55.860]  was that it had low-level parts that dated to the 80s.
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:59.620]  And here we are running it on 2000, 2001 Power Mac G3
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.580]  hardware.
[02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:02.220]  The hardware was way more powerful
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.220]  than what the software was originally designed for,
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.300]  and it made it real fast.
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.900]  And so most of us at the time were either
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:11.780]  dual-booting between the two for different tasks.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:16.060]  I used to run Mac OS 9 on my desktop,
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.700]  and I'd have Mac OS 10 on my PowerBook.
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:21.380]  And it was so painful to switch.
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:25.940]  And 10.1 came out five months later, six months later,
[02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:28.540]  something like that, way less than a year later,
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:29.940]  and was a pretty big improvement.
[02:05:29.940 --> 02:05:32.500]  It was still slow, but it had obviously
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:34.740]  gotten a lot of low-hanging fruit out of the what's
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.140]  making this feel so slow.
[02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:39.980]  But it was nowhere near as dramatic as this WatchOS 2
[02:05:39.980 --> 02:05:41.740]  to 3.
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.380]  It was a nice improvement, but it was really
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:45.860]  a series of iterative improvements
[02:05:45.860 --> 02:05:47.660]  over four years.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:50.340]  As I recall, sometime around 10.4
[02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:54.020]  was when Mac OS 10 finally felt like, OK, this is,
[02:05:54.020 --> 02:05:57.740]  may not be fast yet, but it's at least not slow.
[02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:00.500]  I'm trying to figure out what is going on with WatchOS 3.
[02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:01.780]  How is this possible?
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.860]  Well, I mean, I think Federighi's explanation
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:05.900]  last week on the talk show was great, which
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:09.420]  is basically many of the things that
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.780]  were making WatchOS so slow before were just
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:17.220]  extreme conservatism about how things
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:21.220]  are kept in memory, what apps can do, what they can't do,
[02:06:21.220 --> 02:06:22.900]  what kind of background operations they can and can't
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:23.460]  do.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.580]  That's one of the reasons why basically with WatchOS 1
[02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:27.660]  and 2, every time you launch an app,
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.620]  it was basically launching from scratch.
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.020]  And it was not really able to do much, if anything,
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:34.460]  in the background in the meantime.
[02:06:34.460 --> 02:06:35.620]  So you'd have to launch it.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:37.300]  Then you'd have to wait for it to get new data,
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:38.940]  because the data it had was out of date.
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:41.460]  And it was just slow, and it was a pain.
[02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.940]  And then you'd go, and you'd try to launch it again
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:46.580]  a few minutes later after the watch turned off to save power.
[02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:48.460]  You'd go to launch it again a few minutes later
[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:49.980]  or a few seconds later, and you'd
[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:51.460]  be back to the clock face or the home screen.
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:53.000]  You'd have to go back to the app again
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.540]  or double click on the button to get the last used app
[02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:56.380]  or whatever.
[02:06:56.380 --> 02:07:00.140]  And it was way too aggressive about kicking apps
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.760]  out of memory and about researching what
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:03.420]  they could do in the background.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.060]  And Federighi explained it very well.
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:09.260]  The explanation was basically like, oh, we had extra RAM.
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:11.260]  We overshot our budget on RAM and power.
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:13.840]  And it turns out the way people use the watch is different,
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:17.100]  and it works better than we thought it would for RAM and power.
[02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:19.020]  So we spent some of it.
[02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:23.280]  So the watch now, with OS 3, if you
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.820]  use any of these new features of having these apps in the dock
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:27.680]  and having them be updated more often,
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.020]  or especially if you put them in complications,
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:30.780]  then they can update a lot more often.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.820]  You are going to get less battery life.
[02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:37.140]  But I think it can, when I wear the watch every day,
[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:40.900]  most days I'd go to bed, and the battery would be at like 50%.
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:43.340]  So I'd be willing to spare a little bit of battery life
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:47.140]  to make the thing more useful to me.
[02:07:47.140 --> 02:07:48.340]  I think that's all true.
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:51.120]  And again, I think Federighi's explanation was interesting
[02:07:51.120 --> 02:07:52.580]  and I think very honest.
[02:07:52.580 --> 02:07:54.620]  I think that being stingy with RAM
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:58.780]  was probably very much true.
[02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:01.100]  But strategically, here's my theory.
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:05.220]  I think what we're seeing is that Apple released the watch
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:09.660]  too early and that this is what they should have launched with
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:14.500]  and that the process that they went through of having what
[02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:18.680]  we know as watchOS 1 and then watchOS 2
[02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:21.140]  was what they should have and in the past
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:24.860]  usually went through internally before they got to,
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:26.540]  OK, this is good enough.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:29.620]  That they were probably like a version of the iPhone
[02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:34.900]  that was every bit as crappy as the user experience of watchOS
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.460]  1 and maybe not even crappiness, but maybe
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:40.740]  like the confusing nature of the UI paradigm
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.660]  and the convolutedness.
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:46.320]  And there were like some yada, yada, yada parts of it
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:47.980]  where there's no real spatial thing.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.600]  It's like, well, these glances are down there
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.920]  and you drag them up.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.460]  And the apps are like behind the watch face.
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.380]  You click this button and you get to the apps
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:57.860]  and then they pop forward.
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:08:59.820]  And the glances are sort of like an app,
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:01.980]  except they're limited, but they're always there.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:03.940]  And it's like, well, why are they down?
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.480]  Why is this other thing underneath?
[02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:08.540]  I feel like everything probably goes through that.
[02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:15.980]  And again, I always hate to bring out the Steve Jobs card,
[02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:18.700]  but that one of his gifts was, of course,
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:20.860]  he was great at motivating people to work really hard
[02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:22.940]  and ship things ahead of their time,
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:25.940]  but I also think that he had an uncanny ability
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:29.500]  to keep saying not good enough, not good enough,
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:34.380]  even if it meant shipping years after he wanted to ship.
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:37.060]  Yeah, and as we talked about earlier,
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:39.280]  with Tim versus Phil and everybody else
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:42.660]  for product direction, Steve was the head
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:44.060]  of product direction.
[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.260]  He was the chief editor, and I think
[02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:51.900]  he played large roles in product choices and direction.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:56.900]  And you can't have somebody like that just removed and gone
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.540]  forever and have things not change.
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:01.660]  Things are going to change, and not all of it's
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:02.860]  going to be for the better.
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:03.700]  A lot of it's going to be better,
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:04.500]  a lot of it's going to be worse, a lot of it's
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:05.500]  going to be different.
[02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:06.980]  One of the things that changed is
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:10.380]  the role of that product editing and the head of product
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:13.620]  direction has now, apparently, from what we can tell,
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.820]  been kind of split up between these people.
[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:17.800]  And the watch, from what I understand,
[02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:20.060]  the watch was kind of like a satellite project.
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:22.740]  And it seemed there was a lot about the watch
[02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:26.460]  that was kind of bizarre, like the weird, creepy, stretchy
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:29.460]  face emoji and the ring of friends
[02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:30.960]  you're supposed to digitally touch.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.780]  I mean, the whole thing was weird.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:36.220]  And again, like some of the spatial things
[02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:39.360]  and why watch kit one was just so incredibly bad
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:42.620]  and why they decided to ship that, it does seem like that
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.180]  might have been partially because of this kind of split
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:47.180]  product responsibility.
[02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:50.620]  This was kind of relegated as a satellite project
[02:10:50.620 --> 02:10:53.100]  or a skunk works kind of thing.
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:55.220]  Maybe not because it was considered low priority,
[02:10:55.220 --> 02:10:56.820]  but just because it was something new
[02:10:56.820 --> 02:10:57.820]  and everyone else was busy.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:10:58.100]  I don't know.
[02:10:58.100 --> 02:10:59.100]  I don't know the reason.
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:02.380]  But it was clearly something from like a side project
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:03.940]  division of Apple.
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:07.580]  And it suffered in a number of ways because of that.
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:10.300]  And it seems like they've maybe realized
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:12.940]  like this was not as good as we wanted it to be at first,
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:13.940]  so let's fix it.
[02:11:13.940 --> 02:11:16.180]  Let's put some more into it, and let's actually fix it.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.940]  I think that they would have gotten to this point
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:18.560]  inevitably.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.060]  I just think that it's almost like we've
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:22.100]  gotten an amazing behind the scenes look at how
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:26.420]  Apple goes through designs and iterates.
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:30.300]  And this makes so much more sense, just
[02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:31.780]  a basic fundamental level.
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:33.660]  And it works so much better.
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:36.260]  You have to remember, too, that two years ago, so two years ago
[02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:39.620]  at this point, the watch hadn't been announced yet.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:42.100]  It was announced in September two years ago.
[02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:44.100]  But it was rumored.
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:49.020]  And at the time, Apple was under inordinate scrutiny for Apple
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:53.980]  can't innovate anymore because Steve Jobs isn't there.
[02:11:53.980 --> 02:11:55.460]  And they haven't had a new product
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:59.660]  since the iPod or iPad in 2010, and now it's been forever.
[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.140]  And they're overdue for a product.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:05.340]  So they were under tremendous scrutiny for, hey,
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.860]  how about you release something new
[02:12:06.860 --> 02:12:09.540]  and show us that you can still amaze us?
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:12.300]  And I think part of that was pressure on Tim Cook, the CEO,
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:14.760]  and I think part of that was definitely pressure on Johnny
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.300]  Ive as, well, let's see what Johnny Ive can do now
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:19.020]  that he doesn't have Steve Jobs.
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:21.860]  And ultimately, we don't know who
[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:25.260]  it is who got to say, OK, let's ship the watch this year.
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:29.700]  We'll announce it in September and ship it sometime later,
[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:31.700]  probably next year.
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.180]  I don't know who made that decision
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:34.340]  that this is good enough to ship,
[02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:36.380]  but I think in hindsight, especially now that we've
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:38.940]  seen watchOS 3, it was clearly too soon.
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:41.700]  I think that the watch should have been announced this year.
[02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:46.220]  And maybe I'm wrong because two more years of where's,
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.540]  you know, how about a new product?
[02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:48.340]  How about a new product?
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:49.340]  How about a new product?
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.460]  Maybe that would have been too much to bear.
[02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:54.620]  But I just feel like this really feels to me like what
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:56.860]  watch 1.0 should have been.
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:58.260]  Yeah, no question.
[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:02.300]  I mean, it's still not perfect.
[02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.780]  I mean, nothing ever is, really.
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:06.700]  But it is such an improvement.
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:10.420]  And to have such an improvement after what
[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:13.380]  is a relatively short time, really, I mean,
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:15.660]  heck, the hardware is feeling pretty old at this point.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.740]  I wish they'd update that.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:20.300]  But to have the software go from where it was last year
[02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:23.740]  to this in one year is very impressive.
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:25.340]  But you know, on the other side of that,
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.220]  do you think they actually would have reached
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:28.380]  this conclusion internally?
[02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:30.860]  Because one of the things they can't do really internally
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:35.500]  is learn what people will do and what developers will do with,
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:37.460]  like, how many apps will you use?
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:39.100]  What will apps want to do?
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:40.820]  What apps will end up being compelling
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:42.220]  and which apps won't?
[02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:44.900]  They kind of can't do that very well without just releasing it
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:47.460]  and seeing what the app market and what the users actually
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:48.020]  do with it.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:50.420]  But there is a lot of stuff about the initial release
[02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:53.260]  of the watch that you look at and you're like,
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:56.220]  did they test this much internally?
[02:13:56.220 --> 02:13:59.420]  Did they really think this was going to be good?
[02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:00.180]  I don't know.
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.980]  Yeah, some of the stuff that is in watchOS 3 definitely
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:06.420]  wouldn't have been there if they hadn't launched and observed
[02:14:06.420 --> 02:14:07.940]  what people really use it for.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:10.420]  And a big one is fitness tracking,
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:14.620]  that an awful lot of Apple Watch purchasers,
[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:17.300]  I think maybe they told me in a briefing what
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:18.980]  the percentage is, but it's big.
[02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:21.940]  I don't know if it's public or not, but a big percentage
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:24.180]  that they have found of people buy it primarily
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:26.820]  as a fitness tracking device, that it is just
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:30.660]  a one-to-one competitor with a Fitbit or something like that.
[02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:33.620]  And therefore, they really, really focused
[02:14:33.620 --> 02:14:38.020]  on the fitness and activity tracking in watchOS 3.
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:42.100]  I think that the new default watch face is the one that
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:44.500]  shows the circles as the dial.
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:46.820]  I think that's how big of a deal fitness tracking is,
[02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:51.100]  that it's now the default watch face.
[02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:55.140]  I mean, when I used it, I was all about the fitness rings.
[02:14:55.140 --> 02:14:59.820]  And if I cared less about watch face design,
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:02.220]  I would gladly say that as my home screen.
[02:15:02.220 --> 02:15:04.180]  Right now, I'm just too much of a picky jerk
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:06.980]  to want to use that.
[02:15:06.980 --> 02:15:08.180]  So that's there, too.
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:10.500]  I mean, in some ways, Apple is benefiting
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:14.940]  from the release early and often,
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:16.060]  and especially in the way.
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:17.620]  I think the other thing we're seeing,
[02:15:17.620 --> 02:15:22.820]  I think it makes sense to me, that software takes longer
[02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:24.380]  than hardware in some ways.
[02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:25.900]  Oh, yeah, easy.
[02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:30.580]  Especially to design, because it's too nebulous.
[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:34.540]  There's too many infinite possibilities.
[02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:36.540]  It's the constraints of hardware.
[02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:39.100]  Like, well, look, it has to look good.
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:40.340]  Johnny's made this design.
[02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:42.020]  It can't be any bigger than this.
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:45.100]  It has to be this small so that there's a model that people
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:47.020]  with smaller wrists and women and children
[02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:50.380]  can wear without looking ridiculous.
[02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:55.580]  And the most energy efficient screen we have
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.060]  is going to consume this much power
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:59.060]  and take all these constraints and figure out
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:00.300]  what the best thing is.
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.060]  It almost makes it faster to come up
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:05.380]  with the design than the infinite possibilities
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:07.100]  of software.
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:10.460]  Although, to be fair, I mean, I think
[02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:13.620]  as we're seeing the Apple Watch hardware get somewhat
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:16.460]  long in the tooth now, if you look around the smartwatch
[02:16:16.460 --> 02:16:18.900]  landscape, when the Apple Watch first came out,
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:21.420]  the smartwatch landscape looked pretty miserable.
[02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:24.380]  There was almost nothing else of value.
[02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:27.300]  On the low end, you had Pebble, and Pebble watches
[02:16:27.300 --> 02:16:30.860]  are basically the modern day geek's quartz watch.
[02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:36.980]  So it's not that high fashion.
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:42.500]  It's not particularly glamorous or even graceful or even
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.100]  necessarily even nice.
[02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:45.860]  But it served a very useful purpose,
[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:48.100]  and it was like a great utility.
[02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:50.500]  And it looked like it, but it was priced like it, too,
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:51.140]  and it was fine.
[02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:51.940]  Then you had like-
[02:16:51.940 --> 02:16:53.260]  I still root for them.
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.100]  I don't like Pebble.
[02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:56.020]  I bought one, and I did not like it.
[02:16:56.020 --> 02:16:57.600]  But I still root for them as a company,
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.260]  because I really enjoy the fact that they
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:02.780]  have a very different set of priorities than anybody else.
[02:17:02.780 --> 02:17:04.740]  They're definitely appealing to nerds.
[02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:06.980]  They're definitely appealing to people
[02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:08.980]  who want to get notifications from apps and stuff.
[02:17:08.980 --> 02:17:12.380]  But they value practicality above anything else
[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:14.220]  to a ridiculous degree.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:16.020]  And that's very different than Apple.
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.300]  And also, again, I got to give them credit.
[02:17:18.300 --> 02:17:20.380]  Their pricing is really low for what you're getting.
[02:17:20.380 --> 02:17:22.460]  It's a very good value.
[02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:25.360]  So we had that, and then we had the initial batch
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:27.620]  of Android Wear watches, which were just horrible.
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.340]  They were just the worst.
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.140]  But that was now, what, almost two years ago.
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:34.860]  They've moved on.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:37.620]  Pebble has gotten better.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.660]  They're still not my style, but I greatly
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:41.660]  respect the progress they've made in that time.
[02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:43.420]  And the Android Wear watches, I'm
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:46.940]  now seeing Android Wear watches in person, in the world,
[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:48.180]  like around.
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:49.900]  And occasionally, I'll be somewhere,
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.700]  like I was getting my windshield replaced.
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:54.220]  Thanks, Highway Rocks.
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:56.980]  And the service guy I was talking to had an Android Wear.
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:58.300]  I'm like, what is that watch?
[02:17:58.300 --> 02:17:59.380]  And I asked him about it.
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:01.740]  And it was, I forget which one he said it was.
[02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:04.620]  Is the LG Urbane a thing?
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.140]  Is that a watch?
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.380]  It might have been that one that's sticking
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:08.620]  out of my head for some reason.
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:12.900]  But I've seen now a number of Android Wear smartwatches
[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:15.500]  in person that look decent.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:19.900]  They're all pretty big for me, but they look decent.
[02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:24.700]  And I think they might even look more modern than the Apple
[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:28.100]  Watch, possibly, just because it's a fresher look.
[02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.780]  Again, just like with the Mac Pro,
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:33.620]  Apple set the bar for this is going to be the future,
[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:35.260]  and it's going to be all this GPU power.
[02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:37.580]  Then they just didn't follow through.
[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:40.340]  With the Apple Watch, they set a big bar on fashion.
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:43.260]  And to have this object that is supposed
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:47.620]  to be like this fashionable accessory that you wear,
[02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:52.460]  and then to not update the hardware for a long time is,
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:54.780]  I don't know, I worry about that with the Apple Watch.
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:57.220]  But I think it'll be all right in the long term.
[02:18:57.220 --> 02:18:57.940]  Anyway.
[02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:00.540]  I think we're seeing a pattern that repeated that started
[02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:05.380]  with the original iPhone, where, so the iPhone 3G did come out
[02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:06.900]  a year after the original iPhone,
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.020]  but it was barely an upgrade.
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.500]  I mean, it was really just the 3G.
[02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:13.300]  And I always forget, there's something else.
[02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:14.380]  Maybe it was like GPS.
[02:19:14.380 --> 02:19:15.620]  It had a GPS, yeah.
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:18.700]  Yeah, so it wasn't just the 3G, but the 3G
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.660]  is the one that affected me on a daily basis.
[02:19:21.660 --> 02:19:23.420]  I just remember thinking like, wow, I really
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:26.060]  hate the way this phone feels compared to my old one,
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:29.220]  but oh my god, 3G is so much better than Edge.
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:31.060]  But otherwise, they really didn't
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:34.220]  get a performance upgrade until the 3GS two years later.
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:37.740]  And so it's looking like the serious performance
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:40.140]  upgrade for the watch will come two years after the
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:44.740]  announcement, a year and a half after it was released.
[02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:48.460]  I think ultimately, what the Apple Watch needed
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.860]  from the beginning, and we're seeing some of that now with OS
[02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:53.300]  3, and we'll see what happens on the hardware side.
[02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.700]  What it needed from the beginning
[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.820]  was just like focus and editing.
[02:19:56.820 --> 02:19:58.220]  At the beginning, it was like, oh,
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:19:59.760]  I can do all these different things,
[02:19:59.760 --> 02:20:02.060]  and we have this crazy gold version.
[02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:04.620]  The number of rough edges that got sanded off
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:08.580]  as the product found its place in the market.
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:15.140]  I think, though, you and I are both watch nerds also.
[02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:20.260]  And I'm not sure that the right formula for something that's
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:22.740]  supposed to be a mass market watch
[02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:26.420]  is to have everybody wearing the same shape,
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:29.860]  the same looking rectangle with different bands.
[02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:32.100]  Physically, I think there needs to be
[02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:35.580]  more variety in the physical attributes of the watch
[02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:38.620]  itself for that to succeed in that way if they want to.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:42.260]  And they might not have a chance.
[02:20:42.260 --> 02:20:44.860]  Fashion and watch nerds might just move too quickly
[02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:47.020]  or be too picky.
[02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:48.860]  It just might not work for them.
[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:53.180]  But if they're going to go for that high end or even
[02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.580]  mid-range fashionable angle for this,
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:59.260]  it needs more variety in the actual watch body.
[02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:00.300]  I don't know about that.
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.260]  But it requires a different kind of software focus
[02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:03.000]  that they're not taking.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.420]  So I'm guessing they're not going in that direction.
[02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:05.260]  But like, I don't know.
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:06.900]  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be anything in watchOS 3
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:09.580]  that would hint at a circular face, for example.
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:13.780]  Yeah, or even just maybe have a passive mode
[02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:15.980]  or where you're always showing something on screen.
[02:21:15.980 --> 02:21:19.140]  Or maybe have some that are maybe not round,
[02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:22.300]  but maybe have a thin model that maybe doesn't have the heart
[02:21:22.300 --> 02:21:24.860]  rate tracker on the back for people who don't want that
[02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:26.980]  but want a dressier version or something.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:29.780]  Like, just having more hardware variety.
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:31.220]  Because bands are nice.
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:33.060]  And they do make amazing bands.
[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:35.600]  Overall, Apple's watch bands are excellent.
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:37.740]  And some of them, like the Link bracelet, I think,
[02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.020]  I've never seen anything better than that
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:42.420]  in the rest of the watch world.
[02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:45.700]  But you're still basically everyone's
[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:47.080]  wearing the same watch.
[02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:49.820]  And when it comes to fashion, the one thing,
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:51.260]  I don't know a lot about fashion.
[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:52.840]  But the one thing I do know is that you
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:55.100]  don't want to be wearing literally the exact same thing
[02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:57.180]  everybody else is wearing.
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.900]  You want some kind of variety there,
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:22:00.060]  some kind of individuality.
[02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:02.480]  And putting on a different band is not enough.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:02.980]  That helps.
[02:22:02.980 --> 02:22:03.980]  It's better than nothing.
[02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:06.180]  But it's not enough.
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:09.700]  While at WWDC, I had a very enjoyable afternoon
[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:14.620]  with CGP Grey, a good friend of yours.
[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:16.180]  That guy's an enigma.
[02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:16.660]  It was.
[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:18.700]  It was funny.
[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:19.900]  I was going to bring up coffee.
[02:22:19.900 --> 02:22:20.820]  But we met.
[02:22:20.820 --> 02:22:22.140]  We started with coffee.
[02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:23.460]  And we met at Blue Bottle.
[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:25.180]  And it was very, very funny.
[02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:27.820]  Because I didn't know what he looked like.
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:29.820]  It was like, oh, what about Blue Bottle?
[02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:30.340]  I'll meet you there.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:30.860]  I need coffee.
[02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:32.240]  And he's like, I need coffee too.
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:33.980]  So I got there.
[02:22:33.980 --> 02:22:36.860]  And as right as I got to the line,
[02:22:36.860 --> 02:22:38.700]  and the line was very long, I mean,
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:41.100]  like long even by Blue Bottle standards,
[02:22:41.100 --> 02:22:43.920]  I got a DM from Grey that just said,
[02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:45.860]  no man should stand on the line this long.
[02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:48.220]  And I turned around, and there he was.
[02:22:48.220 --> 02:22:49.820]  And it was exquisitely pulled.
[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:53.220]  It was an amazing introduction, because he timed the text.
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:55.580]  And as soon as I turned around, there he was.
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:57.780]  And I just said, yeah, this sucks.
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:58.740]  Let's go to Pete's.
[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.700]  And he was like, fine.
[02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.220]  And we just walked over to the.
[02:23:01.220 --> 02:23:04.260]  I can't even tell you during WWDC how often that happened.
[02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:05.580]  I like Blue Bottle.
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:06.900]  But I don't like Blue Bottle.
[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:10.140]  Wait half an hour in line, and then wait another 10 minutes
[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:11.060]  for the drip.
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:13.460]  No, it is good coffee, but it's not that good.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.740]  It isn't good enough to wait on that line.
[02:23:15.740 --> 02:23:19.340]  So we got, you knew her there with me the day of the keynote.
[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:21.060]  We went to Phil's, or Phil's E?
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:21.980]  I don't know how you pronounce it.
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:22.640]  I think it's just Phil's.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.620]  I liked it, honestly.
[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:26.020]  I had a good cup of coffee there.
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:28.540]  I would say that was the best cup of coffee I had that week.
[02:23:28.540 --> 02:23:32.020]  Well, I also like their system, where you don't just order,
[02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:33.260]  and then it goes in a queue.
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:36.220]  It's like you wait for a barista to become available,
[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.500]  and then you place your order.
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:41.220]  And then they make your, I always get drip coffee.
[02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:42.980]  And then they make your drip coffee,
[02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:44.560]  and it takes like two or three minutes.
[02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:47.600]  I got worried, because I skipped out of the keynote
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:49.340]  about 20 minutes before it started,
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.900]  because they ran out of, they didn't.
[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:53.580]  I was like, you were late, weren't you?
[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:55.340]  No, no, I was there with plenty.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:56.680]  I was there with a couple minutes to spare.
[02:23:56.680 --> 02:23:59.060]  So what happened is, I got to the Bill Graham Center
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.780]  at like 9.05 in the morning,
[02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:04.060]  and I think they let people in before nine o'clock,
[02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:05.940]  the press people, at least.
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.500]  And I got there at like 9.05, 9.10, I said hello.
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:11.140]  I saw some people I knew, and some Apple PR people,
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:12.620]  and said hello, hello.
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:14.660]  Went over to the coffee, and it was all gone.
[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:17.780]  It was all gone at like 9.10,
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:19.580]  and I was like, what the hell's going on?
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:22.500]  And I went in, and I found a seat, and I was like.
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:24.260]  I mean, granted, if that was the same coffee
[02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:25.540]  they were serving outside on the line,
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.420]  they were doing you a favor.
[02:24:27.420 --> 02:24:29.820]  I guess, because it probably was the same coffee.
[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:34.900]  It just threw me off, because my normal way
[02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:38.500]  is to go to Blue Bottle, and then I go with my Blue Bottle,
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:40.780]  and then go to, when I used to be at Moscone,
[02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:43.400]  and then go say hi to all my friends
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:45.740]  who were waiting in line for the keynote,
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:47.500]  while I've done it to you.
[02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:48.660]  Yes, every year.
[02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:51.020]  I've got, you're waiting in line,
[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:53.220]  and you've been up since like five in the morning,
[02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:55.580]  and I just woke up, and I have delicious coffee,
[02:24:55.580 --> 02:24:57.360]  and I'm gonna use my magic press pass
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:59.500]  to go right to the front of the line and get in.
[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:00.720]  And get a front row seat.
[02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:02.620]  And I've always enjoyed that.
[02:25:02.620 --> 02:25:03.880]  Well, I didn't know what to do this time.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:06.100]  I wanted to get, I had to get a cab to get to the build.
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:08.200]  I didn't have to get a cab, but you know,
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:10.060]  to get there as soon as I could, I wanted to get there.
[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:12.260]  So anyway, 20 and over, so I told Ben,
[02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:14.420]  I was like, screw this, I'm gonna go find coffee.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.700]  So I ran out of the building,
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:18.060]  and found the Phil Z about two blocks away.
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:22.220]  And I didn't know, I didn't know anything about Phil Z,
[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:23.420]  except I'd heard good things.
[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:26.140]  But I just wanted to drip coffee, and Ben wanted one too.
[02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:27.740]  So Ben didn't have the guts to go.
[02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:28.940]  He just said, get me one.
[02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.740]  And I saw that they were gonna make it pour over,
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:34.920]  and that they didn't have like pre-made coffee
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:36.780]  that they could just pour into a cup for me.
[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:39.700]  And I thought, oh, this, you know, at Blue Bottle,
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:40.540]  this would take too long.
[02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:41.620]  I missed the opening of the keynote.
[02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:42.740]  I said, how long is this gonna take?
[02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:44.520]  And she goes, oh, just two or three minutes.
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:46.860]  And two minutes later, I had my two coffees,
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:48.200]  and I was out the door.
[02:25:49.100 --> 02:25:49.940]  Excellent.
[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:54.180]  So I had a, I was so sad because I had just met
[02:25:54.180 --> 02:25:56.820]  Federico Vatici late the night before.
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:00.100]  And you know, he's really into, he's Italian for one,
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.780]  and he's really into coffee.
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:06.780]  And so I had to have my first coffee with Federico Vatici
[02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:11.780]  as the crappy coffee in the line at Bill Graham.
[02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:13.940]  And I was like, I'm so sorry, I'm like,
[02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:15.740]  we shouldn't really drink this, like please.
[02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:18.580]  And to have that be the first coffee
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:20.940]  that I have with Federico Vatici is just heartbreaking.
[02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:21.780]  Criminal.
[02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:24.860]  And so fortunately, we went with you after the keynote.
[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:26.060]  We met you outside, and we went with you,
[02:26:26.060 --> 02:26:28.380]  and we went back to Pete's and got better coffee there.
[02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:29.460]  No, Phil Z we went to.
[02:26:29.460 --> 02:26:32.100]  Yeah, right, yeah, sorry, Phil Z, yeah.
[02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:33.820]  And that was so much better.
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:34.860]  I feel like that made up for it.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.540]  Like I'm just gonna forget about the urn coffee
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:40.340]  that we had in the line,
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:43.660]  and just hope nobody got a picture of it.
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:45.860]  And it was, oh man, it was such a shame.
[02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:50.100]  But the Phil's, or Phil Z, actually made up for it.
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:51.340]  That was really good coffee.
[02:26:51.340 --> 02:26:52.580]  And I had that for the line going back
[02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:54.100]  into the State of the Union, and it was like,
[02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:56.620]  I feel like that was like the forgiveness for the morning.
[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:00.460]  I kinda can't believe how honest their system is.
[02:27:00.460 --> 02:27:02.420]  Like you go to a barista, you wait,
[02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:03.980]  you wait till a barista calls you.
[02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:05.620]  And it's sort of like a barbershop system,
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:07.780]  where you wait in line until a barista says,
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:08.780]  okay, I'm ready, next.
[02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:10.700]  And then you go to the barista,
[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:12.500]  they make whatever you ordered,
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:14.260]  then they call your name when it's ready,
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.100]  and they give you the drink.
[02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:16.180]  You haven't paid for anything yet.
[02:27:16.180 --> 02:27:17.100]  They just give you the drink,
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:19.460]  and then you are, it's just on you
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:21.260]  to go over to where the register is,
[02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.100]  which is separate, and then just tell them
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:25.700]  what's in the cup, and then you pay what you owe them.
[02:27:26.780 --> 02:27:29.700]  I'm glad, because it seems like it makes it very efficient,
[02:27:29.700 --> 02:27:33.820]  but it seems to rely on the honor policy,
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:36.740]  to a degree that you don't really see in retail places.
[02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:39.240]  I'm also, I'm curious to hear if you get any flack
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:41.780]  about us talking up Phil's on this episode,
[02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:45.140]  because when I tweeted a few days back
[02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:47.420]  that Phil's was the best cup of coffee I had
[02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:49.140]  in San Francisco that week,
[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:52.440]  I got a lot of responses that seemed to indicate
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:54.700]  this is not a widespread opinion,
[02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:58.120]  and that apparently Phil's is looked down upon
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.420]  by a lot of coffee snobs in San Francisco.
[02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:03.980]  And I gotta say, I only had one cup of coffee there,
[02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:06.720]  because it was only near Bill Graham.
[02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:08.660]  I don't think there was one closer to where we were.
[02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:11.760]  So like, I only had the one cup there,
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:14.820]  but that one cup was definitely way better
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:16.300]  than what I had at Blue Bottle,
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:18.880]  what I had at other places, like way better.
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.560]  I'm not, I don't have the fine palate that you do,
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.500]  but I had one, I think I only had one Blue Bottle this week,
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:27.700]  and it was good, but the combined experience was worse,
[02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:29.540]  because even in the best case scenario,
[02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:30.780]  you have to wait so much longer.
[02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:33.020]  Right, I have never gone to Blue Bottle in San Francisco
[02:28:33.020 --> 02:28:34.780]  and decided, you know what, that was worth it.
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:36.940]  Because it's like, I always, you know,
[02:28:36.940 --> 02:28:40.500]  I try to go like before going to the first session
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:44.420]  at Moscone, and so I'm in kind of a rush,
[02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:46.060]  and because I never leave enough time
[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:46.900]  when I wake up in the morning,
[02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:48.580]  because who wants to wake up earlier than you have to?
[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:50.340]  So, you know, it's certainly not us.
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.520]  And so like, you know, I go down to Blue Bottle,
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:53.640]  there's this huge line, I'm like,
[02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:54.880]  oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:56.860]  I wait in the line, I wait, I wait, I wait.
[02:28:56.860 --> 02:28:59.140]  Eventually I get the coffee after way too long,
[02:28:59.140 --> 02:29:00.220]  and I'm sitting there, and then I had like,
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:01.980]  you know, something cost fallacy halfway through the line,
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:04.300]  like, God, I really, this is, I'm gonna be late
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.260]  to the session, I'm gonna miss the first 20 minutes of it
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:08.540]  if I wait in this line, but I've already waited
[02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:09.860]  on this line for the last 15 minutes.
[02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:11.580]  It seems like I'm getting close to the beginning.
[02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:15.260]  You know, so all those fallacies and stresses.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:17.980]  Finally get the coffee, and then I have a problem
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:21.960]  on my hands, because now I have this huge, full cup
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.780]  of very, very hot liquid.
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:25.260]  They don't double cup there.
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:26.380]  The best you could, and they don't have
[02:29:26.380 --> 02:29:27.900]  those little jackets, the best you can do
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:30.400]  is wrap a napkin around to try to insulate your hand
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:33.740]  from this scorching hot cup of coffee that,
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:36.980]  like, so then I have to walk from there to Moscone,
[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:40.220]  which is, you know, a medium walk, a few blocks.
[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:42.460]  Try not to spill this coffee on my hand
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:44.060]  or anywhere else as I'm walking with it,
[02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:46.040]  but it's way too hot to begin drinking.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:48.140]  Then I finally get to Moscone, and I have, again,
[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:50.540]  this giant cup of hot liquid that I have to just, like,
[02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:52.900]  still be carrying with me and doing something with
[02:29:52.900 --> 02:29:55.180]  until I finally get into a session, at which point
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:56.980]  there's nowhere to put it in the session.
[02:29:56.980 --> 02:29:58.300]  You know, you can put it on the floor,
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:00.780]  but that's a big risk of getting kicked over,
[02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:02.540]  and you don't wanna be that guy who spills hot coffee
[02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:04.820]  on the rug in Moscone.
[02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:07.340]  So, like, you're basically left, like, holding this thing
[02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:09.260]  for, like, the next half hour as it cools down
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.100]  to a drinkable temperature, and then you have
[02:30:11.100 --> 02:30:13.860]  this giant cup of coffee that you basically have to finish,
[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:16.020]  and usually that's too much caffeine for me,
[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:17.940]  even at their small size, usually I only drink, like,
[02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:20.180]  two thirds of it, but I feel kinda pressured
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:21.020]  to finish the whole thing, it's like,
[02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:22.820]  well, I have nowhere to put this.
[02:30:22.820 --> 02:30:25.420]  Then I'm, like, buzzed over the whole, it's just,
[02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:28.240]  every time I say, you know what, that wasn't worth it,
[02:30:28.240 --> 02:30:30.520]  next time I should just either, like, you know,
[02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:32.720]  grab an espresso somewhere, you know, anywhere,
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:35.260]  anywhere can serve a reasonable espresso in that area.
[02:30:35.260 --> 02:30:37.120]  So, like, you just grab a quick espresso,
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:40.580]  or just tolerate the Moscone coffee, or just drink tea.
[02:30:40.580 --> 02:30:43.360]  Every time I think that, and every time I forget
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:44.780]  to do it the next time.
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.220]  They need those things that Gray and Brady
[02:30:47.220 --> 02:30:49.060]  are always talking about, the hot stoppers.
[02:30:49.060 --> 02:30:49.900]  Isn't that what they call them?
[02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:51.700]  Yeah, that would solve one of those problems.
[02:30:51.700 --> 02:30:52.900]  It would solve the travel problem.
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:53.840]  Yeah, but that's it.
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:55.220]  Phil's gives out hot stoppers,
[02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:57.460]  cause there was, I actually kinda jogged back
[02:30:57.460 --> 02:31:00.620]  from Phil's to the keynote with two coffees,
[02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:02.740]  and so without hot stoppers, I would have
[02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:04.600]  two mangled, scarred hands.
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:07.260]  Anyway.
[02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:08.460]  But you would have good coffee, though.
[02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:12.100]  The whole reason I brought, or was reminded to mention Gray
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:15.020]  was I know one of his pet bugaboos with the watch
[02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:18.060]  is he wants third-party watch faces.
[02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.260]  Yeah, I would love that.
[02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:21.540]  I broke it to him, and I'm gonna break it to you
[02:31:21.540 --> 02:31:23.660]  that that is never gonna happen.
[02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:26.220]  That is not gonna happen, and this is gonna make sense
[02:31:26.220 --> 02:31:28.140]  to you, and it made sense to Gray,
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:31.220]  but it's this weird crevice that Apple,
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:35.580]  and only Apple is in, in the smartwatch world,
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:37.340]  where they do fancying themselves
[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:41.460]  to be a real watch company, and as a real watch company,
[02:31:41.460 --> 02:31:45.100]  they have, there's certain things that everything,
[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:46.460]  anything that you can see is always
[02:31:46.460 --> 02:31:47.740]  gonna be San Francisco.
[02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:49.860]  Now, they could maybe enforce that for third parties,
[02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:50.700]  possibly.
[02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:56.560]  Any analog dial is gonna use those hands.
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:59.020]  That's the Apple style of watch hands.
[02:31:59.020 --> 02:32:00.500]  At the big ovals.
[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:02.720]  I don't know what you call them, but those big ovals,
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:03.740]  the capsule-shaped hands.
[02:32:03.740 --> 02:32:07.140]  I guess they're, are they, yeah, they are ovals, yeah.
[02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:12.140]  Yeah, and in the real world, high-end watch companies
[02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:16.020]  typically have things like that, like the hands on a Rolex,
[02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:17.340]  all, they're not all identical.
[02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:19.980]  There may be two or three different styles of Rolex hands,
[02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:23.380]  but they're, all Rolexes have hands
[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:25.780]  that are instantly recognizable as Rolex hands.
[02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:27.640]  Yeah, they're kind of all like in a family.
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.120]  Yeah, in a family.
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:34.040]  And the dials are all unmistakably Rolex-style dials.
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:38.780]  And insert name of your favorite high-end watch company
[02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:41.340]  here, and those things are true for all of them,
[02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:42.940]  because anybody, if it wasn't true for them,
[02:32:42.940 --> 02:32:44.460]  they wouldn't be a high-end watch company.
[02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:46.640]  And Apple fancies itself a high-end watch company,
[02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:48.820]  and therefore, they're, and if you look at all
[02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:51.140]  of their dials, they're, other than the Mickey one,
[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:52.620]  which is sort of an exception,
[02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:57.220]  the Mickey ones are a little different.
[02:32:57.220 --> 02:32:59.460]  They're unmistakably Apple watchy.
[02:32:59.460 --> 02:33:02.340]  There's an Apple watchiness to all of their analog ones
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.820]  and the digital ones, too.
[02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:07.260]  And so therefore, there's no way they're gonna open that up
[02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:10.380]  to third parties and have people making, you know,
[02:33:10.380 --> 02:33:12.340]  watches that look like, I don't know,
[02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:14.080]  Omegas or something like that.
[02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:15.820]  Yeah, I mean, there's. It's never gonna happen.
[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:16.980]  There's so many, yeah, I mean,
[02:33:16.980 --> 02:33:19.820]  there's the intellectual property infringement problem
[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:22.620]  of, and if you look at other smartwatch platforms,
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:24.780]  you know, Pebble, Android, like, they do have this problem
[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:28.460]  where there are tons of, like, knockoff faces
[02:33:28.460 --> 02:33:29.620]  of, like, popular watch brands.
[02:33:29.620 --> 02:33:32.060]  Like, there's just copyright and trademark infringement
[02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:32.960]  all over the place.
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:34.660]  Like, it's a mess, and so of course,
[02:33:34.660 --> 02:33:36.700]  Apple wouldn't want that, and certainly wouldn't want
[02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:37.620]  the liability of dealing with that,
[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:40.580]  nor the kind of, like, you know, low-brow nature of that.
[02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:42.860]  But also, you know, technically speaking,
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:44.640]  I think there's a lot of technical reasons
[02:33:44.640 --> 02:33:47.500]  why Apple would want to control the face app.
[02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:50.060]  And they could overcome these barriers
[02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:50.960]  if they really wanted to.
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:52.960]  They could make, like, you know,
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:54.500]  basically like a watch face kit,
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:56.960]  and, you know, have you kind of, like, supply,
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:58.780]  you know, certain custom behaviors
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:00.740]  or certain graphics or whatever else,
[02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:02.540]  but have them kind of still run the code.
[02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:05.620]  Like, they could do a system with that if they wanted to.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:07.700]  But I think they don't want to for these reasons, you know,
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:09.400]  and I think you're right that we're probably
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:10.240]  never gonna get that.
[02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:13.980]  And honestly, the reason I want it is completely selfish.
[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:15.660]  The reason I want it is because I want to design
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:17.500]  my own watch faces, because I'm a huge, like,
[02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:20.260]  watch face design critic nerd.
[02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:23.580]  Like, I nitpick every watch face I see,
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:25.740]  and there are very few that I'm happy with.
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:26.860]  And even the ones I'm happy with,
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:29.420]  I'm usually, like, only mostly happy with,
[02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:31.560]  because I'm that kind of nerd.
[02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:33.300]  And I think you are probably similar in that regard.
[02:34:33.300 --> 02:34:34.620]  Is that safe?
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:37.340]  Yeah, there's watches that I like, except I find,
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:40.420]  if I find that the hour hand is just too close
[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:42.380]  to the size of the minute hand, it's out.
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:44.460]  Yeah, I mean, like, yeah,
[02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:46.180]  because that's legitimate.
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.500]  That impacts legibility of telling the time quickly.
[02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:50.460]  Yeah, or vice versa.
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:52.740]  Maybe the hour hand strikes me as too small.
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:55.880]  Now, there's no confusion, but to me,
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:58.260]  it just looks ungainly.
[02:34:58.260 --> 02:34:59.680]  It has to be in proportion.
[02:34:59.680 --> 02:35:01.860]  And I'm in trouble with watch faces,
[02:35:01.860 --> 02:35:03.420]  because I've been affected by,
[02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:05.380]  or I've been bitten by the, like,
[02:35:05.380 --> 02:35:09.140]  getting annoyed by poor placement of date windows bug,
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:13.180]  where there's, like, this, like, design virus
[02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:14.780]  destroying the watch industry right now,
[02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:16.380]  because everyone's putting date windows all over the place,
[02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:18.620]  because it turns out most people who buy a watch
[02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:20.860]  want to have the date on it somewhere.
[02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:22.900]  And so you have to kind of, like, shove it somewhere
[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.140]  on the dial, and there's lots of easy,
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:26.820]  but bad places to do it.
[02:35:26.820 --> 02:35:28.820]  Like, oh, we'll just cut the three in half
[02:35:28.820 --> 02:35:30.140]  and kind of stick it there.
[02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:31.380]  Or we're gonna stick it diagonally
[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:33.080]  between the four and the five, and it's like,
[02:35:33.080 --> 02:35:35.780]  oh, it just, oh, it looks so bad.
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:37.460]  I'm picky about things like that,
[02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:41.160]  but the date complication in particular,
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:43.900]  you opened my eyes to the fact that there's a lot of watches
[02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:45.260]  coming out where it's in a bad place.
[02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:47.420]  And then once you start looking for it, you see it.
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:50.160]  And I think one of the reasons why is the,
[02:35:51.980 --> 02:35:54.460]  so many watches don't make their own movements.
[02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:57.900]  And so they're using, like, an ETA movement
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:00.240]  or the Japanese company now that,
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:03.340]  now that ETA isn't really selling their movements
[02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:04.620]  on the open market.
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:06.660]  But if you're limited by the,
[02:36:06.660 --> 02:36:09.180]  what you can do to the standard movement,
[02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:10.740]  you're limited in certain ways
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:11.860]  as to where the date can go.
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:13.340]  And all of a sudden it just sticks out like,
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:15.280]  well, they didn't wanna put the date there,
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.280]  but they had to.
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:17.500]  And you can just see it.
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:19.980]  Yeah.
[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.260]  It bothers me.
[02:36:21.260 --> 02:36:23.540]  So many otherwise great watch face designs
[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:25.260]  are ruined by a bad date window.
[02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:26.140]  Yeah.
[02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:27.540]  Anything else you wanted to talk about this week?
[02:36:27.540 --> 02:36:29.180]  What else do you have on the list?
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:31.540]  I mean, we've definitely lost all the listeners
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:32.620]  talking about watch design,
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:33.460]  so don't worry. No, I don't think so.
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:34.300]  Everyone's gone.
[02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:36.480]  I think it ties in with watchOS 3.
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.320]  I really do.
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.440]  I bet you have just lost more listeners
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:40.980]  during the last five minutes than you lose
[02:36:40.980 --> 02:36:42.380]  when you talk about baseball.
[02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:46.260]  I don't wanna talk about the podcast thing
[02:36:46.260 --> 02:36:47.220]  with the mid-roll.
[02:36:47.220 --> 02:36:48.100]  Nah, it's too late.
[02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:48.940]  Too late.
[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:51.500]  I don't wanna talk about it.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:52.700]  What about this car shifter thing?
[02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:54.060]  Did you see that?
[02:36:54.060 --> 02:36:55.560]  I know the story.
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:56.900]  I know the whole recall thing.
[02:36:56.900 --> 02:36:58.540]  I have not actually seen the shifter,
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:01.500]  but I saw all the anecdotes of the complaints
[02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:05.500]  people had filed about this exact model of car
[02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:07.380]  or something with the same shifter like this.
[02:37:07.380 --> 02:37:09.400]  It started rolling backwards when I got out
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.100]  because I thought it was in park,
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:12.820]  and I guess it shifted itself into neutral or something.
[02:37:12.820 --> 02:37:14.460]  I've never seen a car like this before.
[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:17.700]  I guess I don't find myself in new cars all that often,
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:20.380]  but so the car, so the terrible tragedy-
[02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:21.580]  I'm trying to find a picture of it.
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:24.500]  This Anton Yelchin, the guy who played Chekov
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:25.940]  in the new Star Trek movies,
[02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:27.680]  died in a terrible freak accident
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:31.180]  where his Jeep Cherokee, he got out of it.
[02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:33.840]  He thought he had it in park, apparently got out of it,
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.460]  and it was either in neutral or reverse
[02:37:36.460 --> 02:37:38.180]  and ran down the hill and pinned him
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:41.100]  against his own gate and he got killed.
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:43.220]  The design of this shifter is so bad.
[02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:44.700]  It just goes up and down.
[02:37:44.700 --> 02:37:45.520]  It's like a-
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:46.360]  Oh, I see.
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:47.260]  Think of it like a paddle shifter.
[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:49.080]  Yeah, so you're kind of like putting it in different mode,
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:51.260]  just kind of like up, up, up, down, down,
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:52.100]  that kind of thing, right?
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:52.940]  Yeah, it's exactly.
[02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:54.100]  It's like thinking of like,
[02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:56.940]  so it's like you just hit up three times to put it in park,
[02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:59.140]  but if you hit up two times, you're in neutral,
[02:37:59.140 --> 02:38:01.460]  or maybe it's like how hard you press it or something,
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:03.280]  but you're not actually moving it
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.900]  and clicking it into these positions
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:06.740]  like you do on a traditional one,
[02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:08.020]  and so it's so easy.
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:11.180]  I just cannot believe that this design shipped
[02:38:11.180 --> 02:38:15.900]  because I think I would see what a problem this design is
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:17.900]  even without having the benefit
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:20.700]  of this tragic news story to put it in context
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:23.500]  because it just seems to me like this is a design
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:25.440]  where you have to be paying very close attention
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:27.600]  to the indicator light of what gear you're on,
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:31.020]  whereas with the traditional one, I don't even look.
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:34.260]  I just hit the brake, push all the way up,
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:35.700]  and I know I'm in park.
[02:38:35.700 --> 02:38:38.140]  I can absolutely, with 100% certainty,
[02:38:38.140 --> 02:38:41.980]  put my car into park every single time blindfolded.
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:45.600]  Right, and this is, I think,
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:47.060]  I've seen in a lot of cars recently,
[02:38:47.060 --> 02:38:49.740]  especially higher-end cars and newer cars,
[02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.900]  a lot of the makers are kind of playing
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:53.600]  with the shifter lever and redesigning them
[02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:56.020]  in different ways to make them electronically controlled
[02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:58.140]  instead of like a direct kind of linkage,
[02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:01.380]  and I apologize in advance to John Siracuzzo
[02:39:01.380 --> 02:39:02.220]  for getting any of this wrong
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.240]  because he's way more of a car nerd than I am,
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:07.180]  but basically everyone is kind of like messing
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:10.080]  with the shifter design and the parking brake designs,
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:11.860]  and there's so many of them are electronic now,
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:13.100]  and so they have these weird controls
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:16.100]  that are of poor design.
[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:20.780]  The good ones I've seen, it's weird at first to get used to,
[02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:22.780]  but it's actually better long-term,
[02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:25.900]  which is like the BMW ones,
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:28.360]  park is a button on top of the shifter,
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:29.660]  so the shifter moving up and down
[02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:31.700]  switches you between reverse neutral drive,
[02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:32.700]  but if you want to put it in park,
[02:39:32.700 --> 02:39:34.000]  it's actually a button on top,
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.580]  so you can't, it's very clear
[02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:37.780]  which one of those things you're doing.
[02:39:37.780 --> 02:39:40.980]  Tesla's the same way, where Tesla, it's a column shifter,
[02:39:40.980 --> 02:39:41.940]  which this is the first time
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:43.540]  I've ever had a column shifter,
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.140]  but I got used to it pretty quick
[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:47.340]  because it's like down is drive,
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:49.460]  and then there's a button on the end to hit it for park,
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:51.000]  and you have to hit that button every time,
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.300]  and the physical action of pushing that button in
[02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:57.860]  is nothing like any other operation on that lever,
[02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:00.800]  so you're very unlikely to accidentally do it.
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:04.340]  Right, whereas on this Jeep design, putting it in park
[02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:06.420]  is just pushing a little bit long,
[02:40:06.420 --> 02:40:08.900]  either, I'm not quite sure if it's how long you press up
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.320]  or how many times you press up,
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.620]  but it's only ever so slightly different
[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.020]  than putting it into neutral,
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:16.900]  and I'm laughing, and it's terrible that this guy died,
[02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:18.580]  and that other people have obviously been hurt too
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:20.220]  because there's a product recall,
[02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:23.120]  but it's just mind-boggling that you would make
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:26.220]  putting it in park something that's hard to distinguish.
[02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:31.220]  Yeah, I mean, the bad design that goes into car interiors
[02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:36.500]  and that actually ships in car interiors boggles my mind.
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:39.740]  Like, there's so, and this is like way worse
[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:40.980]  than date windows on watches.
[02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:44.280]  There is so much horrible design in car interiors
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.580]  and the controls in car interiors these days.
[02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:48.020]  I don't think anybody's ever been killed
[02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:50.940]  by a poor placement of a date window on a watch dial.
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:54.380]  Probably not, yeah, it's horrible,
[02:40:54.380 --> 02:40:59.380]  because as we see with this, design flaws in cars,
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:03.260]  that can cause actually fatal consequences.
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:04.820]  That can actually get people killed,
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:07.620]  and often they do actually get people killed,
[02:41:07.620 --> 02:41:10.620]  and they gotta take design seriously,
[02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:11.700]  and when you have something like this,
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.260]  it's like, does anybody actually think about this?
[02:41:14.260 --> 02:41:15.140]  Do they do any testing?
[02:41:15.140 --> 02:41:18.380]  I mean, it's just a tragedy.
[02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:23.140]  Yeah, I do see the origins of why they would ship
[02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:25.620]  this horrible design was just the basic idea
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:28.100]  of we wanna switch to an electronic system
[02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:32.500]  instead of a analog system of where this is,
[02:41:32.500 --> 02:41:34.540]  but so, okay, there's the why,
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:36.560]  but this was not the answer.
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:38.480]  This is terrible.
[02:41:39.700 --> 02:41:41.140]  Anything else?
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:41.980]  No, I think that's it.
[02:41:41.980 --> 02:41:45.940]  I think we've definitely put most of the audience to sleep
[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:47.660]  or lost them in the watch discussion.
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:48.500]  I don't think so.
[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:50.340]  I think people are gonna love the watch discussion.
[02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:52.820]  All right, well, we are under three hours, so.
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:53.660]  Not bad.
[02:41:53.660 --> 02:41:54.480]  Exactly as predicted.
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:41:56.660]  I wanna thank our sponsors in reverse order,
[02:41:56.660 --> 02:42:01.660]  Ministry of Supply, Audible, and Wealthfront,
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.340]  and I wanna thank you, Marco Arment,
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:07.340]  your podcast, Accidental Tech Podcast.
[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:09.260]  Is it ATP.fm?
[02:42:09.260 --> 02:42:11.060]  You've also got, what else do you got?
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:12.460]  You got more podcasts now.
[02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:14.720]  I got Under the Radar with Underscore David Smith,
[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:17.340]  Relay.fm slash Radar, Top Four with my wife,
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:19.740]  Relay.fm slash Top Four.
[02:42:19.740 --> 02:42:21.540]  The wonderful Tiff Arment.
[02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:23.380]  Yeah, she's the best.
[02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:26.140]  Do you feel bad with the developer one
[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:28.460]  where Underscore was totally up to date
[02:42:28.460 --> 02:42:31.780]  and knew all the APIs by Tuesday of WWDC week?
[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:35.180]  Or do you just feel like, no, this is great,
[02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:38.380]  Underscore will fill me in on what I need to know?
[02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:39.700]  Basically the latter.
[02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:42.100]  When you first become friends with Underscore,
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:45.220]  if you're a developer, you just feel incredibly lazy
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:46.460]  and inadequate by comparison.
[02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:49.740]  You're just like, my god, what I did during this time
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:54.100]  was have a steak and edit a few photos and go to sleep.
[02:42:54.100 --> 02:42:57.020]  And what he did during this time was make four new apps
[02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:59.300]  and learn everything about all the APIs.
[02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:02.020]  And yeah, you definitely feel like, wow,
[02:43:02.020 --> 02:43:03.700]  I waste a lot of time compared to this guy.
[02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:05.500]  He runs at a higher metabolism, clearly.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:07.420]  We ran into him on Sunday,
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:09.500]  the first day we were out for WWDC,
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:12.420]  and me and Amy and Paul,
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:16.780]  friend of the show, Paul Cofasos,
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:18.540]  walked over to the Bill Graham Center
[02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:20.580]  so I could get my credentials and stuff.
[02:43:20.580 --> 02:43:22.220]  And we ran into Underscore on the way.
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:23.580]  We ran into a bunch, it was amazing,
[02:43:23.580 --> 02:43:25.620]  we ran into so many people on the way.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:27.260]  Underscore's there, we're all freezing.
[02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:29.940]  It is like 61 degrees and windy
[02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:31.300]  and everybody is just frozen to bone.
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.020]  Underscore's wearing shorts and a t-shirt
[02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:35.660]  and looks totally comfortable.
[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:39.300]  Yeah, I mean, the frustrating thing about Underscore
[02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:40.840]  is that he's just a really great person
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:42.340]  and there's basically no downsides.
[02:43:42.340 --> 02:43:47.340]  Like, when somebody's super together in life,
[02:43:47.340 --> 02:43:49.540]  it's tempting to kind of think like,
[02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:52.660]  man, at least they're a jerk or something.
[02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:54.980]  You try to find something that makes you feel less bad
[02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:58.300]  about how you are less productive than them or something.
[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.100]  And with him, you just can't find that
[02:44:00.100 --> 02:44:02.980]  because he is just a really good guy
[02:44:02.980 --> 02:44:05.180]  and he's also very productive and it's very frustrating.
[02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:06.040]  The other thing that killed me
[02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:08.300]  is he was wearing a really big backpack.
[02:44:08.300 --> 02:44:10.220]  So it looked like he was,
[02:44:10.220 --> 02:44:11.660]  it was like, why are you wearing a big backpack?
[02:44:11.660 --> 02:44:12.900]  And it turns out that that was,
[02:44:12.900 --> 02:44:14.700]  it actually wasn't a really big backpack.
[02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:17.740]  It was a really small, this is everything he had
[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:18.680]  for the entire week.
[02:44:18.680 --> 02:44:22.280]  Like, he was just getting,
[02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:24.000]  he hadn't checked into his hotel yet.
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.020]  So like, everything he brought for an entire week
[02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:29.820]  in San Francisco was in the, you know,
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:31.660]  when I was thinking of just walking around
[02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:33.820]  for the afternoon, it looked like a very big backpack.
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:35.820]  When it realized that it was everything he had
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:38.520]  for the week, it's like, I cannot believe how efficient is.
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:40.140]  Yeah, he must have, he's gotta know
[02:44:40.140 --> 02:44:41.220]  one of those secret techniques
[02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:43.000]  for folding t-shirts or something.
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.100]  Yeah, we all have a lot to learn from him.
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:47.620]  All right, thank you, Marco.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:45:16.620]  Thanks.
