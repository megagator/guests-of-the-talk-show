[00:00.000 --> 00:07.120]  You have had, to me, an extraordinary 2021 working-wise, culminating like what, two or
[00:07.120 --> 00:11.840]  three days ago with a very, very fun segment on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show.
[00:12.720 --> 00:17.200]  It's true. I told you. I told you a text message. It's much harder to book being on
[00:17.200 --> 00:20.800]  your podcast than it is to be booked on The Tonight Show.
[00:23.280 --> 00:29.840]  I'll actually tell you, they rescheduled on me once, I think. Yes, we were booked for the
[00:29.840 --> 00:35.440]  day before, and then I got pushed, which I can now see in hindsight, I was pushed for Matthew
[00:35.440 --> 00:41.520]  McConaughey and Haim, you know, the band Haim. Yes, yes. They were on the night before, and then
[00:41.520 --> 00:46.000]  so I was supposed to be on the 14th. They moved me. I said, totally understand. Then when I
[00:46.000 --> 00:49.760]  actually saw what aired that night, I was like, totally understand. I mean, obviously it was
[00:49.760 --> 00:55.280]  going to be totally fine no matter what, but I think I was rescheduled for this show two or three
[00:55.280 --> 01:00.960]  times. Well, it's been a busy week or a busy month. I don't know. I don't know who I was pushed
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.920]  for on this show, but I'm sure to like those other celebrities, it was worth it. I thought that
[01:07.920 --> 01:13.680]  segment was great. It's a classic bit. You get a tech person out and you say, here's some tech
[01:13.680 --> 01:19.760]  products for the holiday season. You got a funny host who's going to demo them with your assistance.
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.440]  You got a couple of great jokes in, I thought. It's actually so much easier to be on something
[01:25.440 --> 01:29.120]  like this versus like hosting something, right? Because you don't have to be funny.
[01:29.760 --> 01:34.720]  The host is the funny one. Like Jimmy Fallon is the funny one. There's nothing I can say or do
[01:34.720 --> 01:39.760]  that's like going to be funnier. So it just kind of tried to be myself. Right. Like no matter what
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.400]  happens, he can make it funny. Like the robot follow you around thing could have completely
[01:44.400 --> 01:49.680]  failed and he could have made it funny. In fact, often that is what makes it funny. Yeah. In
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.000]  rehearsal, it failed every time. So I was actually visibly very excited during the segment, which
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.600]  might've been a little bit hard. If everything had like gone really well at the rehearsals,
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.200]  I would have had to kind of like fake it, but that was genuine happiness that it was working live.
[02:06.880 --> 02:13.040]  There was also, you Instagrammed before you were in the green room and Jimmy Fallon popped in to
[02:13.040 --> 02:17.040]  say, Hey, this is going to be great. We're going to have a great fun, but sort of gave you a weird
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.240]  look. And I was like, that's why, you know, it's nice that he pops in so that you're not just
[02:22.240 --> 02:26.800]  meeting him for the first time on stage, you know, cool your nerves, you know, get, get on the same
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.800]  page, get the vibe going, but why do you give her a look? And then you turn to the mirror after
[02:30.800 --> 02:37.840]  he closed the door. And I knew what happened. You had those damn Ray ban, the Ray ban stories in
[02:37.840 --> 02:44.960]  partnership with Facebook slash meta. Yeah. Yeah. No, I realized, realized in hindsight,
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.200]  I probably should have like tagged it that it was recorded with that, but most people picked up on
[02:49.200 --> 02:55.440]  it with the mirror situation. Well, but then it came out on the show as a surprise. Was that a
[02:55.440 --> 03:00.400]  legit surprise to him on the show that, that you had taken footage of him when he popped in? He
[03:00.400 --> 03:06.640]  seemed genuinely surprised. He was genuinely surprised. We did tell him like before we aired,
[03:06.640 --> 03:10.640]  right? Like that, that this is what was going to happen. But when he walked in, it was pretty,
[03:10.640 --> 03:16.640]  pretty much a surprise. I know that he asked me, I don't know if it actually ended up airing,
[03:16.640 --> 03:22.880]  but it's like, is that legal? Yeah, that was, that was in the final cut. Because I actually,
[03:22.880 --> 03:28.400]  what was cut was a little bit of a longer answer about consent and what Facebook or meta says
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.960]  about, oh, there's the light and there's the gesture for lifting up your hand to your temple
[03:32.960 --> 03:37.600]  that should signal to people that you're recording, which I don't really think is much of a signal to
[03:37.600 --> 03:43.360]  people, but all of that kind of got cut. But yeah, it was, it was fun. It was definitely, I mean,
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.840]  I had a ton of fun. He is so nice and genuinely interested in tech, which is awesome.
[03:51.040 --> 03:55.200]  Yeah, he definitely seemed like it. Yeah, I mean, the true story was like,
[03:55.200 --> 03:59.520]  he said it in the beginning of the segment, which was, you know, nice TF to me, but he said,
[03:59.520 --> 04:04.960]  he had reached out, he saw my iOS 15 video in September, one night, just got this random message
[04:04.960 --> 04:10.400]  from him on Twitter. And he had a question about the background sounds, you know, the background
[04:10.400 --> 04:17.920]  sounds features an accessibility feature in iOS 15. And he was like, I followed your instructions,
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.920]  it's not working, where do I find this? And it's, I mean, common question, it's kind of buried in
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.680]  the control center when you enable it. And so I just walked him through it. And he was like,
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.680]  thank you. And he was like, that'll be my last tech question. I'm like, no, it won't be. And
[04:29.680 --> 04:32.720]  next thing I know, his booker was reaching out. So it was awesome.
[04:33.440 --> 04:40.160]  The other thing I thought, and he mentioned it when he did, unless I'm forgetting,
[04:40.160 --> 04:47.600]  the three products you demoed were the Ray-Ban Stories, then the robot, which we will get to
[04:47.600 --> 04:51.440]  last, even though that was second, and then the latest version, Oculus Rift, and he
[04:51.440 --> 04:56.080]  played a game. When he put the Oculus on, you know, he mentioned that he has a big head,
[04:56.720 --> 05:02.080]  you know, like a large head, which is actually, you know, I think you know this, it's actually
[05:03.280 --> 05:08.560]  it's like a weird thing, but it's very true of people who are successful, like actors and TV
[05:08.560 --> 05:12.880]  personalities. And then you meet them in real life. And you're like, boy, that guy has a big
[05:12.880 --> 05:19.520]  head. Like Humphrey Bogart apparently had a head the size of a basketball. Just interesting. But
[05:19.520 --> 05:26.400]  I thought, you know what, those Ray-Ban glasses looked better on him than they've looked in a lot
[05:26.400 --> 05:31.360]  of the reviews that I've seen, you know, because they they are slightly I think they're slightly
[05:31.360 --> 05:35.760]  larger than typical Ray-Ban Wayfarers. Well, what you're saying is he looked better on them
[05:35.760 --> 05:40.240]  than I did, which is fine. It's true. They're big on my face. Well, but they I think that,
[05:40.240 --> 05:44.000]  you know, but you know, like, your hair looked great. And that helps, you know,
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.440]  it. But I do think that there are they are they are like the side of them are bigger.
[05:50.000 --> 05:56.400]  And they're one side. I think they're one size fits all. Yeah, I think they are. Yeah.
[05:57.680 --> 06:05.120]  I'm looking up because they sent them to me and I never asked for a size. Hmm. Yeah, they are.
[06:06.960 --> 06:10.960]  Well, I mean, that'll obviously change, right? Everything gets smaller over time, right? I mean,
[06:10.960 --> 06:18.960]  we can go back to the 1987 Wall Street where the cell phones were the size of a brick, you know,
[06:18.960 --> 06:23.520]  but it was super cool that the guy had a cell phone in his car. I mean, yeah. And also, I will
[06:23.520 --> 06:28.640]  say like, I, as this was the premise of my review back in September, I wore those things for a week
[06:28.640 --> 06:34.960]  and a half. And nobody knew that they were weird sunglasses with a camera in it. Nobody, unless I
[06:34.960 --> 06:39.920]  told them. And unless I was like, specifically recording them and up and close to them.
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.640]  No one had any idea that those were had cameras in it or were any sort of smart glasses.
[06:44.640 --> 06:50.480]  Right? Because they look, they definitely look, you know, I'm not, they look much, much closer
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.160]  to standard Wayfarers than like Google Glass, you know, which obviously looked like somebody was
[06:56.160 --> 07:03.040]  wearing a, what the hell is that? Right. Or like the Snapchat spectacles, even the ones now, like,
[07:03.040 --> 07:08.800]  they designed them. And actually, for that Ray Ban review, I spoke to Snapchat about that or snap.
[07:08.800 --> 07:12.400]  And they're like, no, we designed these. So people would know, like, these are weird,
[07:12.400 --> 07:15.120]  like, what is going on with them? Like, you kind of look like a little like,
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.760]  bug head with the little, like circular. It's like, they have circular rings around the cameras.
[07:22.320 --> 07:28.400]  I, you know, we, it's funny going back, because Google Glass, if I recall correctly,
[07:28.400 --> 07:36.400]  was around 2013, 2012 or so when it was a thing. And, you know, the reactions were all over the
[07:36.400 --> 07:43.600]  place. The phrase glass holes, it's, I mean, exploded in, was way, the term glass holes was
[07:43.600 --> 07:51.200]  way more popular than Google Glass ever, ever was as a product. But I, there were defenders
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.720]  of the weird look who, you know, at Google or people who just liked them who were saying,
[07:56.720 --> 08:00.880]  well, that's, they did this on purpose. You know, they're not, they don't look that bad.
[08:00.880 --> 08:07.600]  And they're lightweight. And we kind of wanted people who at least have any awareness of Google
[08:07.600 --> 08:11.760]  Glass to know when they're conversing with somebody who's wearing them because they had
[08:11.760 --> 08:17.600]  a camera and a microphone, I think too, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And that's a, I,
[08:19.440 --> 08:26.080]  and that did have one camera. But I think with this, the creep, the creep part of it is that
[08:26.080 --> 08:31.600]  they do look so similar and their main, they, they do look so similar to the originals and like,
[08:31.600 --> 08:38.080]  what are typical Ray-Bans and like the main thing that these do is, is they have cameras, right?
[08:38.080 --> 08:41.840]  Like, that's the main thing about them. And I actually keep wondering, like, why didn't
[08:42.560 --> 08:49.120]  they just do the speaker and the microphone? And because the cameras are like, like, I don't know.
[08:49.120 --> 08:54.000]  I'm just like, it's, whereas, you know, Bose has these, these glasses with just the, they're
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.160]  basically like AirPods in the glasses, right? And they're, people like them. They really like them.
[08:58.160 --> 09:01.600]  They like them for running. They like them for like walking the dog. And I just wonder,
[09:01.600 --> 09:06.080]  do they just do that for this? And then, and even when you talk to the executives at Facebook or
[09:06.080 --> 09:09.440]  Ray-Bans, people say, oh, the best, one of the best uses of this is listening to music and
[09:09.440 --> 09:15.120]  doing your phone calls. And okay. So maybe just like, didn't, you didn't have the cameras. Like
[09:15.120 --> 09:20.640]  these wouldn't be as creepy at people. It is, it does make me think though, like the curmudgeon
[09:20.640 --> 09:33.200]  in me wants to still be aghast at ubiquitous cameras recording everything. But the realist
[09:33.200 --> 09:38.320]  in me realizes that this is the way the world is gone. You know, like they're, you know, and
[09:38.320 --> 09:44.000]  they're on homes, they're there on, and, you know, and, and it's not like we as tech critics
[09:44.000 --> 09:51.280]  should, should just ignore it. And when something happens, like the Amazon doorbell thing where
[09:51.280 --> 09:56.960]  they worked out deals with the local police in places to like share footage with them and have
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.840]  like a program where the police encourage people in the neighborhood to get it, not necessarily
[10:01.840 --> 10:07.120]  shady. I think it in theory might've been well-intentioned from a certain perspective,
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.400]  but from another perspective, it's like a civil liberties nightmare, right? But people have,
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.600]  people have, you're allowed to put your own security camera on your building. And now
[10:17.600 --> 10:26.080]  they're everywhere. We had, we had a, like a, it was just like the weirdest story a couple
[10:26.080 --> 10:32.560]  months ago, but across the street from our house, a young woman just got sucker punched at like
[10:32.560 --> 10:37.760]  nine 30, you know, she's walking one way on the sidewalk. Another guy who's sort of like a known
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.840]  neighborhood, wild person just sort of flails around, but has never really attacked people.
[10:43.840 --> 10:45.680]  I thought you were going to say like a watch person.
[10:45.680 --> 10:51.840]  No, no, no. He's like a, he's like a weird shifty guy. Nobody quite knows what his deal is,
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.240]  you know, probably, you know, maybe drug addict, I don't know, but you know, but he does it.
[10:56.240 --> 10:58.480]  You're not worried about him listening to this podcast, it seems.
[10:58.480 --> 11:05.600]  No, definitely not. But if you look at like Philly's Reddit, which is to me a much better
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.760]  version of Nextdoor, people know who this guy is. And he does a thing where he like
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.000]  flails around with his arms out, almost like a dance move. But in this case,
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.720]  he was just walking past this young woman and just punched her as they passed on the sidewalk.
[11:20.160 --> 11:27.120]  And we, one of our neighboring buildings had it on a security camera and I was like, oh yeah,
[11:27.120 --> 11:31.840]  good luck catching this guy. And it's like, no, because the security cameras, it's like,
[11:31.840 --> 11:38.400]  you know, I don't know if it's 4K, but it doesn't look like the grainy 480p security footage.
[11:39.200 --> 11:43.680]  And it was at nighttime. So I thought when I heard they have it on camera, it's like,
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.080]  ah, nobody's going to see anything. It's going to be all muddy. And it was like,
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.560]  no, it was like clear as a bell and all the vision on that stuff has gotten so good.
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.760]  Yeah. Like, so the people in the neighborhood, like it became a news story. You know, the victim,
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.320]  she stayed anonymous. You know, I probably would too. But people who knew who the guy was were
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.320]  able to tell the police and they got the guy. And it's like, those cameras are everywhere.
[12:06.320 --> 12:11.280]  No, it had a similar thing here too. I mean, we are, somebody set fire to something in the park.
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.080]  We live across the street from a park and set fire and the police were going around asking,
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.840]  do you have, you know, does your security camera, does your ring pick up what, like this section of
[12:21.840 --> 12:26.160]  the park? And I said, no, unfortunately mine doesn't. And I looked, but I don't, they might
[12:26.160 --> 12:31.520]  have ended up getting from somebody other angle in the park. So bottom, yeah, I mean, bottom line,
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.960]  I agree with you that this is the way things are going. And to many, in many senses, it is
[12:36.960 --> 12:42.080]  a nightmare. In other senses, there are these positive things, just like any technology,
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.800]  there's the good and the bad. I think on, on these glasses, I heard from a lot of people after
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.720]  I published that review, like, oh, well, like, you could just hold up your phone or people can
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.440]  secretly record on their phone with on your phone without knowing people have perfected sort of the
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.520]  like sly, like hold up your iPhone and it looks like you're on a call or something, but you're
[12:59.520 --> 13:05.280]  recording. And that's true too, right? I mean, and frankly, that's way better quality than these
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.440]  these. I mean, this is not very good video quality when you're recording and it's only 30 seconds
[13:09.440 --> 13:17.520]  too. So, well, that's like, it's like that there was that whole rash in Japan of upskirt videos.
[13:17.520 --> 13:23.200]  And this is, this is pretty far back because, you know, I forget when the law was passed,
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.520]  but creepy guys were on the subway, crowded subways, and they mastered the art of taking
[13:29.520 --> 13:35.680]  upskirt videos of women. And so Japan, you know, they have a law, I believe it's still on the
[13:35.680 --> 13:38.560]  books, because it's one of those laws that I feel like is never going to come off the books,
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.680]  because who's, what politician is going to stand up and say, I would like to make upskirt videos
[13:43.680 --> 13:49.760]  easy again. But all cell phones have to make an audible camera click sound, even if they're muted.
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.120]  So I believe if you use the iOS, you know, or Android, you know, Japanese versions of the OS's,
[13:55.120 --> 14:00.480]  even if you mute your phone, when you take a picture, it makes a click. Does that work?
[14:00.480 --> 14:04.720]  I did not know that. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, is it loud enough to, is a click loud enough
[14:04.720 --> 14:10.640]  on a subway? But, you know. Well, I mean, like, again, with these glasses, there's a,
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.680]  there is an indicator light. As I said in my review, that indicator light is the size of a
[14:15.680 --> 14:23.120]  poppy seed legitimately compared to a New York City bagel poppy seed. And people don't see it
[14:23.120 --> 14:28.000]  at, as I said in the piece, like at a social distance, people don't really see it. But if
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.720]  you're closer than that, people do see it. Yeah. And I think outdoors, it's harder to see because,
[14:32.720 --> 14:36.880]  you know, obviously, you're fighting against the sun to make the light bright enough.
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.320]  Yeah, exactly what I had done in my testing, people said, I don't see it because of the sun
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.520]  in their sunglasses. So you wear them in the sun. In your review, as I recall, it was you,
[14:47.520 --> 14:53.760]  you had taken, you recorded an entire conversation with your mother and told her,
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.960]  oh, by the way, I'm recording this. Yep. Yep. Yep. I did that. I did that. I recorded actually
[14:58.960 --> 15:02.560]  a ton of people that week. I was kind of, my premise was like, I'm going to wear these and
[15:02.560 --> 15:06.880]  see if people know if I'm recording them. I told everyone. I had their consent, like, after I
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.520]  started recording as I told them very quickly after, like, and do you know that I'm recording
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.720]  you right now? And everyone's like, what? And they would freak out about it. Yeah, a couple of people
[15:16.720 --> 15:22.560]  did not want me to post those videos, which I didn't. But your mother was played along.
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.320]  My mother plays along with everything. My last piece too, I decided I was going to,
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.000]  I wanted to learn about NFTs. I was trying to understand this whole world. And so I made an
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.080]  NFT out of my son's artwork, and then I gave it to her in a crypto wallet. And she's still is,
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.080]  is, the piece came out and now she understands, but she was like, why did I have to be involved
[15:42.080 --> 15:48.080]  in this piece? Because you need, you needed somebody to go along with it. Yeah, exactly.
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.920]  So the third gadget that you should, that you demoed for Jimmy Fallon is called the JITA.
[15:54.480 --> 16:01.600]  That's G I T A. Like Cheetah. That's how I remembered it on air. Yeah, but they, but if
[16:01.600 --> 16:07.600]  you wanted to Google it, I will put a link in the shown notes, but it's G I T A. The JITA Mini by
[16:07.600 --> 16:17.680]  Piaggio. Fast forward. How would you describe this thing? It's like a cooler, like a mini cooler
[16:17.680 --> 16:25.200]  on wheels that drives itself. Sort of autonomous cooler on wheels, but it's not an actual cooler,
[16:25.200 --> 16:31.200]  but it does have a container that you open it up, open up. It's it's yellow and spherical.
[16:31.200 --> 16:38.720]  I'd say maybe about the size of a beach ball. Yeah. And it balances sort of like a segue
[16:38.720 --> 16:45.040]  with two wheels and you know, gyroscopic thing. But the thing it can do is it follows the owner
[16:45.040 --> 16:51.760]  around. So you could, I guess, in theory, if you found this useful and you don't have to navigate
[16:51.760 --> 16:58.160]  any steps on your Jersey journey, you could like take it grocery shopping and put your groceries
[16:58.160 --> 17:03.920]  or puts even just some of your groceries in it, in the JITA, and it'll just follow you home from
[17:03.920 --> 17:12.480]  the store. You did a way better job explaining what it is. It is really neat. I can't imagine
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.720]  the scenario where I would use it. I mean, and I live in a very flat city with a few steps and it's
[17:18.720 --> 17:25.920]  only 28 pounds if you do need to like lift it up or down a step. But damn if it didn't follow
[17:25.920 --> 17:31.280]  Jimmy Fallon around the stage. Oh, it did. Yeah. I mean, so it's funny. I actually heard from
[17:31.280 --> 17:37.520]  somebody on Instagram this morning who told me they bought one. And he said he uses it to get
[17:37.520 --> 17:48.960]  around. Let me look up. I think he's in Dallas. And he puts his art supplies in it. But like you
[17:48.960 --> 17:55.040]  said, like groceries. I mean, I could see the appeal for somebody who's disabled and has a hard
[17:55.040 --> 18:03.040]  time carrying stuff. Sure. Or pushing a cart, right? Right. The issue becomes like it sometimes
[18:03.040 --> 18:10.400]  needs to be like navigated a little bit. And then you kind of always have to have it following you.
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.760]  You can lock it. One thing I didn't mention on the show is that you can lock it so you can use
[18:15.760 --> 18:20.560]  the app to lock it. And that will lock both the follow function and the little container.
[18:20.560 --> 18:24.560]  So I guess you could like park it outside someplace. I just feel like someone would
[18:24.560 --> 18:30.560]  steal it. But don't worry, you'd have the camera from your house to see if someone stole it.
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.600]  Here's my question is how did it know to follow Jimmy and not follow you?
[18:36.640 --> 18:43.200]  It knows because you, well, we paired it to him. Basically, when it's in this unlock mode,
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.720]  whoever's standing in front of it and when you press the button on the front, it knows to follow.
[18:48.720 --> 18:55.840]  It knows to follow. I will tell you it gets very confused at times. And like I tested it for a
[18:55.840 --> 19:02.080]  weekend here with my son, my four year old son. And if I would step in front of it, or he would
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.000]  step in front of it when it was following me, it sometimes would then start following him.
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.720]  But also, it's hilarious to test this with kids. It was funny, the funniest part of the show. And
[19:12.720 --> 19:17.360]  again, it's like we said, Jimmy Fallon is, you know, obviously, a very talented comedian. But
[19:17.360 --> 19:23.120]  it was funny because he started by going slow in a circle around the counter you had set up
[19:23.120 --> 19:29.840]  for demoing the other products. And then he got feigned being creeped out or and sped up. And damn
[19:29.840 --> 19:34.640]  if that little guy didn't speed up to chase him around, you know, like, yeah, I have this
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.640]  hilarious video of my son just like sprinting in the like on our sidewalk. And like we have bumps
[19:40.640 --> 19:44.400]  on our sidewalk. So he is running, it's following him really fast. And then it just like falls over
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.560]  because it goes over like a sidewalk, you know, crack or something. But it's it's super, it will,
[19:50.560 --> 19:55.120]  it will run, it will run after you. Yeah, that was surprising to me, because I thought,
[19:55.120 --> 20:00.240]  hey, that's doing a pretty good job following him around. And you know, it's slow, but maybe
[20:00.240 --> 20:04.080]  the people who need something like this, it would be slow. But the fact that it could go as fast as
[20:04.080 --> 20:09.040]  it could, and who knows if that's even the top speed, that's, that was, that was wild to me.
[20:09.040 --> 20:16.480]  And so it's not the thing is, my point is that it is not like some kind of near field chip,
[20:16.480 --> 20:22.240]  you know, like an air tag type thing that Jimmy Fallon had to put in his pocket. You just stand
[20:22.240 --> 20:28.560]  in front of it and hit Okay, now follow me. And it like uses cameras to see Okay, you looks like
[20:28.560 --> 20:33.040]  you're wearing blue jeans. Okay, I got your I have your two legs. Now I'll just follow you around.
[20:34.160 --> 20:36.400]  That's right. That's pretty impressive.
[20:36.400 --> 20:47.920]  Yep. Yeah, yeah. 18, 1850 bucks. So it's not exactly. It's not like a whimsical purchase.
[20:47.920 --> 20:52.880]  But I think Roomba is a good like a high end Roomba is like 850 bucks. I mean,
[20:53.440 --> 20:58.640]  you know, this thing doesn't vacuum, but it's not outlandishly priced. It's
[20:59.520 --> 21:03.120]  and again, it's it's sort of it reminds me of the glasses with the camera.
[21:03.120 --> 21:10.800]  It's early days, right. And I mentioned this on my podcast. Two episodes go with Jim Dalrymple.
[21:10.800 --> 21:15.280]  We could talk about this because I want to talk about your interview with Elon Musk,
[21:15.280 --> 21:21.360]  which was excellent. Like I said, you have been I don't know how you did it crazy busy. But like,
[21:22.080 --> 21:28.000]  talking about Apple and autonomy. It seemed you know, everybody seems to think they're making a
[21:28.000 --> 21:37.040]  car. But there's so many other uses for autonomous technology. And and it's inevitable, right? We're
[21:37.040 --> 21:43.520]  going to have robots. I mean, it we kind of do now. And they all are kind of laughable little
[21:43.520 --> 21:49.760]  things that don't do much. And our poor Roomba is always getting stuck under the table. But it's
[21:49.760 --> 21:55.360]  really kind of awesome to have a little disc shaped robot who goes around your house and
[21:55.360 --> 21:58.160]  picks up bits of dust and, you know, crumbs and stuff.
[21:59.200 --> 22:04.800]  Totally. And it's funny, you're there was a question that was cut from the the Fallon
[22:04.800 --> 22:09.360]  piece where right after we showed the robot he asked, he said, he said, Oh, you interviewed
[22:09.360 --> 22:13.840]  Elon Musk a few weeks ago. And you also talked about robotics. I had this answer, which they
[22:13.840 --> 22:19.520]  cut because obviously it was super smart and no time for this really smart answer. But where I
[22:19.520 --> 22:23.440]  sort of made the parallel that yeah, like Tesla says they're a robotics company. And that's
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.080]  because of the autonomous driving stuff they're working on and the Tesla bot that they're working
[22:28.080 --> 22:33.920]  on. And yeah, it's it's similar. It's like, this is the early days of it looking at the Jita.
[22:33.920 --> 22:37.680]  Of course, like, do you want to trust this thing right now with anyone's life?
[22:38.560 --> 22:41.920]  And I did have that funny little bit where I said like, Oh, you could put your kid in here,
[22:41.920 --> 22:44.160]  but like you wouldn't, you know, he was like, I wouldn't put my kid in here.
[22:46.320 --> 22:52.400]  But like, yes, as we're like thinking about where this is all heading. Yeah, like we can take cues
[22:52.400 --> 22:59.920]  from this funny little luggage rolling machine. You know, you could, you could put like a little
[22:59.920 --> 23:04.320]  tiny dog in there, you know, like the little dog some people have that like fit in a in a purse.
[23:04.320 --> 23:09.440]  So I will, we could put in the notes, there's a funny tick tock, where somebody's doing that with
[23:09.440 --> 23:15.600]  the Jita. Okay, somebody sent that to me too. So people have done it, I did not want to do that to
[23:15.600 --> 23:20.560]  my dog. I've put browser through a lot with my project projects, just like my mom, but browsers
[23:20.560 --> 23:31.360]  not going in the Jita Mini. But also, what, what did I want to say about Elon and autonomy that
[23:31.920 --> 23:36.800]  your your clever observation on the show that was cut? Was that was another thing about the Jita?
[23:37.760 --> 23:42.400]  Anyway, I'll think of it again. But yeah, well, put your dog in here.
[23:42.400 --> 23:48.160]  Well, the other thing is, and it's so obvious, but I feel like it doesn't get talked enough about
[23:48.160 --> 23:55.920]  that. Okay, I'm compelled by Elon Musk's description of Tesla's vehicles as effectively
[23:55.920 --> 24:02.560]  being robots, you know, and it's, you know, there are things we can debate about Tesla's claims
[24:02.560 --> 24:08.080]  about the level of their self driving at the moment. I have some pretty smart friends who
[24:08.080 --> 24:13.680]  think self driving cars, fully self driving, like take a nap in the car or just, you know,
[24:13.680 --> 24:19.120]  like the rumors that Apple wants to make one without a steering wheel and you just get in and
[24:19.680 --> 24:26.480]  tell Siri, you know, where to take you and off you go. That that'll never happen. Some smart friends,
[24:26.480 --> 24:32.080]  Elon Musk, obviously things that will happen. He's pretty smart. We'll see. I mean, it's a good goal.
[24:32.080 --> 24:41.200]  But to me, the overriding difference is people die in cars, right? Or people who get hit by cars
[24:41.200 --> 24:46.480]  die, right? That's, you know, even worse, right? You're better off in the car than to be the poor
[24:46.480 --> 24:52.320]  person, you know, crossing the street or riding a bicycle. The stakes are literally life and death.
[24:53.200 --> 25:00.320]  Yep. Yeah. And it's serious injuries too. Like you could get in a car accident and hopefully nobody
[25:00.320 --> 25:07.600]  dies, but people get hurt. Roomba is not going to hurt anybody. You know, this Jeter is, I don't see
[25:07.600 --> 25:11.760]  a way you can get hurt. I mean, I guess a kid could be playing with it and tip it over. But
[25:11.760 --> 25:16.080]  it's, it's really funny that you say this. I've been thinking a lot about this. And it's about
[25:16.080 --> 25:23.760]  this trust, right? And I felt it a little bit when I saw my son. And I didn't post this because you
[25:23.760 --> 25:29.280]  can see his face and everything. But I had this robot like running after my son, right? And I'm
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.680]  thinking, Oh, this isn't like what's the worst that can happen here? Right. And I sort of felt
[25:33.680 --> 25:39.040]  a little irresponsible. But I kept thinking, all right, well, it's gonna stop or I can get in there
[25:39.040 --> 25:45.520]  and I can defend my son against this thing, right? Like it wasn't like gonna it he's bigger than it.
[25:46.400 --> 25:53.440]  But it made me think about I have a I'm trusting this thing right now. Right. And that's, there's
[25:53.440 --> 25:59.200]  gonna be these different levels of our trust in technology and our different levels of trust in
[25:59.200 --> 26:04.560]  robotics. So like you're bringing up right now, like, there's a big difference between a car and
[26:04.560 --> 26:10.000]  this little robot and cars can kill people. But we know that right now people are using the Tesla
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.800]  self driving features. And they have some trust in it, right? Like they, they're enabling it, they
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.040]  know it's a beta feature, and they're using it. And then you see these crazy videos of people just
[26:21.040 --> 26:26.480]  like, putting something else in the driver's seat or whatnot. But some of us will look at that and
[26:26.480 --> 26:32.720]  be like, absolutely not. So I keep thinking about these, that like, this level of trust and what's
[26:32.720 --> 26:39.440]  gonna, will there be certain people that will be like, I give it all, I'm okay with it. And then
[26:39.440 --> 26:41.680]  there's gonna be these others that just say absolutely not.
[26:42.560 --> 26:48.640]  I and it makes me think of Well, everything makes me think of Star Wars, but it makes me think of
[26:48.640 --> 26:56.640]  R2D2 and C-3PO in especially in the first movie, like they're both, they're key players in the plot,
[26:56.640 --> 27:03.120]  but they could not appear more harmless, right? I mean, the what's the worst that could happen R2
[27:03.120 --> 27:10.240]  could tip over on you. I mean, I mean, and I know that in the prequels later on, they added the
[27:10.240 --> 27:16.400]  ability for R2D2 to fly and he had like a flamethrower at one point, you know, so that,
[27:16.400 --> 27:22.560]  you know, so that, you know, that's a little different. But as seen in 1977 in Star Wars,
[27:22.560 --> 27:30.000]  these robots were just slow and gentle, right? I mean, and C-3PO like what an interesting choice
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.400]  not to give him a very computer voice and instead have this very gentlemanly, very gentle and
[27:38.400 --> 27:46.480]  gentlemanly Anthony Daniels do the voice, which just emphasized that he was, you know, harmless.
[27:47.360 --> 27:51.520]  So I'm going to tell you something, Jon, I guess I'm telling all your listeners this,
[27:51.520 --> 27:57.440]  which I think I've said publicly before. I have tried to watch Star Wars.
[27:58.080 --> 27:58.640]  Oh, no.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.800]  And I think I've made it through the first one. Every time I fall asleep.
[28:04.800 --> 28:13.760]  And I've said I'm going to try again soon with my son. But you will pretty much never find me
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.120]  making Star Wars references in what I write or what I do video because I can't really.
[28:20.800 --> 28:23.280]  So that's a secret that I need to tell you all.
[28:23.280 --> 28:26.480]  Well, you are familiar, though, with R2D2 and C-3PO.
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.040]  Yeah. But like, I can't go deep, you know, I'm not gonna try to go deep with you on it right now.
[28:31.040 --> 28:36.640]  Like, you know, like, if you could buy like a C-3PO and have him, you know,
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.640]  clean up your house and, you know, get you a get you a beverage from the fridge,
[28:41.840 --> 28:43.680]  fold your laundry, that'd be great.
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.600]  Well, and I was actually just writing about this for 2022 look ahead of tech.
[28:50.560 --> 28:58.000]  Amazon's coming out with that Astro robot, and it's invite only and who knows really how many
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.840]  they're going to ship sounds like more than they thought. But it does. It has cameras to
[29:03.840 --> 29:07.600]  learn your house. And so you're going to let this thing roam around your house talking about that
[29:07.600 --> 29:13.760]  camera intersection. These are cameras that are connected to Amazon. It does a lot of the Alexa
[29:13.760 --> 29:19.200]  things. But the main thing that makes it different from the typical stationary Alexa in the corner is
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.400]  that it roams around and it learns the different rooms. And it can monitor for when you're not
[29:24.400 --> 29:31.440]  there. So it has security features, but it also has like the ability to go to where people are
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.160]  hanging out. So sort of like autonomous in that sense, like if it knows that the family hangs out
[29:36.160 --> 29:44.080]  in a certain area, the Astro rolls over there frequently. So that's coming early next year.
[29:44.080 --> 29:58.000]  I hope to review it. All right, let me take a break here. Thank our first sponsors are
[30:14.080 --> 30:21.120]  really competitive prices and include they have award winning technical support offered 24 hours
[30:21.120 --> 30:28.880]  a day, seven days a year, 365 wait 24 hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. That's the way that
[30:28.880 --> 30:35.520]  works. So even if like this episode comes out in a day or two and you need help on Christmas,
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.560]  you could get it. I don't. It seems a little crazy to me. Maybe let that see if you can keep
[30:40.560 --> 30:47.440]  that web server go until the 26th or 27th. But if you need it, they're there. And developers have
[30:47.440 --> 30:53.760]  been trusting Linode for projects both big and small since 2003. That's a long time in the web
[30:53.760 --> 30:58.640]  hosting business. Deploy your entire stack with their one click app marketplace or build it all
[30:58.640 --> 31:04.800]  from scratch. Manage everything yourself with supported centralized tools like Terraform.
[31:04.800 --> 31:10.160]  They make cloud computing fast, simple and affordable. I'm proud to say I host my website
[31:10.160 --> 31:14.560]  there. That's not because they sponsor the show. If they stop sponsoring the show, I'd still keep
[31:14.560 --> 31:19.360]  my website there because where else am I going to move it? They're perfect. So go to Linode dot com
[31:19.360 --> 31:27.520]  slash the talk show. Create a free account with your GitHub or Google account or just use your
[31:27.520 --> 31:32.320]  email address. And by starting at that URL, you'll get one hundred dollars in credit. One hundred
[31:32.320 --> 31:37.920]  bucks! Linode dot com slash the talk show. What's going on there? You got some noise.
[31:37.920 --> 31:45.520]  I got a lot of noise. But if I turn the heat off, my family will freeze, John.
[31:46.400 --> 31:52.160]  So would you like my family to freeze for your show? But it's gotten so much louder,
[31:52.160 --> 31:56.400]  is the question. Like over the year, I think it got louder. I bet we have to change some of the
[31:56.400 --> 32:05.920]  filters. How cold is it? In this area right now, it's 42 degrees outside. I meant in your house.
[32:05.920 --> 32:12.400]  I always assume. Yeah, it's 41 here. I always assume the weather is similar. Hold on, let me
[32:12.400 --> 32:19.120]  see. Yeah, I got a kid that's sick. I got a four year old who has a cold upstairs and I got a
[32:19.120 --> 32:26.320]  five and a half month old trying to nap. So I don't want him to freeze. I don't honestly, it's
[32:26.320 --> 32:31.760]  not that it's run. We're at 70. Yes. Do you have this battle in your house? Oh, yeah. All the time.
[32:31.760 --> 32:38.960]  Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I've I've effectively been banned from using the Nest app. Because you get
[32:38.960 --> 32:44.720]  yelled at or are you which I'm going to assume you're the one who says turn it down. Or if it's
[32:44.720 --> 32:52.720]  heat, turn it down. If it's AC, turn it up. It's it's more complicated than that. Amy has my wife
[32:52.720 --> 32:57.920]  Amy just has to me complicated theories about when you turn the heat up and down and that you turn it
[32:57.920 --> 33:02.480]  way down at night. And I'm like, well, you know, why why do that? You know, why not keep it, you
[33:02.480 --> 33:09.520]  know, keep it around the same 68 or whatever all the time. But I've been told to stay away. But
[33:09.520 --> 33:18.000]  yeah, it's funny here. The we have two kids and so we use the the the monitor the baby monitor a lot
[33:18.000 --> 33:23.440]  and the baby monitor has built in temperature, right? It shows what what the what it is in the
[33:23.440 --> 33:29.120]  rooms. And there's always a discrepancy between what the baby monitor says and the Nest says.
[33:30.000 --> 33:38.160]  And my big fight is always, what should we trust more? This $100 baby monitor with a crappy sensor
[33:38.160 --> 33:45.360]  temperature sensor? Or should we trust the actual unit in the house? And then we also bought these
[33:45.360 --> 33:50.800]  nest sensors that we put in the rooms. And again, there's like discrepancy and I'm like, well, what
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.680]  should we trust more? This whole podcast is about trust and technology. You got I'd say you got
[33:55.680 --> 34:00.240]  fighting with your spouse, your partner about the heat, you got to go with the nest because even if
[34:00.240 --> 34:07.600]  the nest is off, like let's say that when your nest claims that it is 68, you're going to have
[34:07.600 --> 34:15.680]  to donate an accurate NASA quality thermometer would say it's actually like 69 and a half,
[34:15.680 --> 34:20.240]  you know, it's, you know, yours a little low, but then once you know the numbers you like on your
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.840]  nest, you know, they'll they should be consistent. Right. Right. But this is like constant battle.
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.800]  And I hear this from a lot of like, other moms or dads, mostly dads, I'm always like the sides of
[34:30.800 --> 34:38.400]  like, we cannot keep adjusting the thermostat to what it says on the baby monitor. Right. Right.
[34:39.360 --> 34:45.600]  That is not something we cannot live our life that way. And it's this constant battle. And it's like,
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.000]  it's same thing, like, someone's cold in the house, we're turning up the heat, like five
[34:50.000 --> 34:58.080]  degrees. So but maybe just one. Yeah, I'm, I you do kind of have me pegged though, like in general,
[34:58.080 --> 35:02.720]  and it's not even that I'm cheap, I'll waste money on X, Y, and Z. It's lucky that I haven't
[35:02.720 --> 35:09.280]  bought one of these $1,800 Jita's already just to play with it. But in my mind, it's less work to
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.200]  tweak the thermostat than to just put another hoodie on in the winter, you know, put a sweater
[35:15.200 --> 35:19.440]  on on top of the weather I already was, or in the summer, just, you know, it's summer, you're
[35:19.440 --> 35:24.480]  supposed to just be wearing a t shirt and shorts, you know? Yeah, I think we usually agree on when
[35:24.480 --> 35:32.160]  at night, I'd rather be warmer at night. Like, I don't want to turn it down at night. Anyway,
[35:32.160 --> 35:40.640]  let's, let's talk about something else you've covered recently, your, your combination column
[35:40.640 --> 35:47.040]  and video stuck in the metaverse for 24 hours. Oh, yeah, let's talk about that. Again, your
[35:47.040 --> 35:53.680]  commitment to these pieces blows me away and makes me feel lazy, to be honest, because I would never
[35:53.680 --> 36:02.000]  do that. You checked into a hotel with two Oculus rifts so that you could keep them on all the time.
[36:02.000 --> 36:06.480]  Well, now they're called metaquests. Metaquests, all right, metaquests. It's a nice thing they
[36:06.480 --> 36:11.760]  decided to change the name mid-project, because, you know, that was like a week after the meta
[36:11.760 --> 36:17.200]  rebrand and the, I honestly don't know why they had to change the name of the Quest. Yeah, I don't
[36:17.200 --> 36:22.400]  know either. Why? Like, what's wrong with Oculus? Like, what, that was, they dropped the Oculus and
[36:22.400 --> 36:28.240]  put in meta, so it's metaquest2. Right, they already had a brand that was disassociated from
[36:28.240 --> 36:34.080]  Facebook. If they felt like, hey, we gotta, we gotta stop branding everything Facebook,
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.920]  you know, we've kind of got a publicity problem or perception problem, we should have a broader
[36:39.920 --> 36:45.200]  brand, Oculus was already there, so why do that? Right, I guess it's like, we'd rather realign and
[36:45.200 --> 36:50.560]  be associated with this thing. Right. So we want to make this the meta. Right, I guess that's the
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.360]  thing, is that it's central to the whole reason they picked the name meta, is this thing, so that
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.520]  we actually, you know, it's not so much that they wanted it to get away from Facebook, but that they
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.240]  want meta to be known as the leading brand of these things. But anyway, you checked yourself
[37:04.240 --> 37:10.800]  into the hotel for 24 hours and tried— You would do the same, too, if you had two little kids.
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.280]  I might check myself into a hotel for 24 hours. I might do that after we record here, but
[37:15.280 --> 37:22.880]  I could not, I could not stand wearing a headset for that long. And I've, I have used the, I
[37:22.880 --> 37:32.800]  believe the current Oculus, but only briefly, my son has the HTC Vive. Oh, really? Which is for,
[37:32.800 --> 37:40.160]  like, gaming PCs, so that's one that's, like, tethered. And I've used that one significantly,
[37:40.160 --> 37:46.240]  just because, all right, it's yours, but you got to let, you got to let me review it.
[37:46.240 --> 37:50.240]  Right. You want to know what he's looking at in there, too.
[37:50.240 --> 37:59.040]  I find it to be so, well, when he does, he still uses it, but it's, it is interesting to me how,
[37:59.040 --> 38:03.280]  like, he uses it enough that it doesn't feel like it was a waste of money to get it for him,
[38:03.280 --> 38:09.760]  but he doesn't use it that much. And his explanation, and I believe him, is that most
[38:09.760 --> 38:16.480]  of the best games aren't meant for VR yet, even on PC. And so there's a few, but when he is,
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.960]  it is funny because it's so immersive that if I knock on his door and pop in his room,
[38:22.960 --> 38:28.640]  I think I can usually see what's going on because it gets mirrored to the actual computer display,
[38:28.640 --> 38:34.640]  actual computer display, but he'll sometimes jump out of his chair when he realizes that
[38:34.640 --> 38:37.760]  somebody's entered the room because, right, because he has no idea.
[38:37.760 --> 38:43.280]  Right. I couldn't do it. I don't know. And I argue with my pal and colleague Ben Thompson
[38:43.280 --> 38:51.200]  about this. Ben is more optimistic about VR for work, that you could sit down anywhere
[38:51.840 --> 38:58.160]  and just, instead of having a laptop or a tablet, like, you could just put this headset on and
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.000]  you'll have a virtual display with, or multiple virtual computer displays in front of you, like
[39:04.640 --> 39:11.440]  Minority Report, and your hand gestures will just work, and you can have these meetings that are
[39:12.240 --> 39:19.120]  all-encompassing virtual experiences. I get the meeting thing a little bit, but I just don't think
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.000]  that's what people want. I don't think what people want after the last two years of Zoom fatigue
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.440]  is make this more an all-engrossing of my attention while I'm doing it.
[39:30.800 --> 39:34.080]  Well, I was actually going to say I would love to have a meeting with you in there,
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.560]  because you're kind of the perfect person. Like, we haven't seen each other in how long?
[39:40.560 --> 39:46.800]  Two years? At least, right? Longer? Maybe longer? Right? I can't remember if I missed-
[39:46.800 --> 39:55.360]  iPhone 11 launch? Yeah, like 2019. Yeah. It's probably the last time we saw each other.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  Right. And like, we've probably, we have seen each other on Zoom meetings. We definitely have.
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.920]  But like, there, it is, have you, have you had one of these? Have you used it yet? Like,
[40:05.920 --> 40:09.360]  just to do a meeting? No, not to do, not to do a meeting. I should, I should do it with Ben.
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.960]  You got to do it. You got to do it. Do I do it frequently? No. But when I do it,
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.400]  I'm always like, man, I really just felt like I met with that person. And it's, and it's obviously
[40:20.400 --> 40:24.480]  also like, that person did not look like themselves. They looked like a cartoon with no
[40:24.480 --> 40:29.760]  legs. Like that is what you, your avatar might look a little bit like you. You have kind of a
[40:29.760 --> 40:37.280]  good avatar face, I feel like. I had a good, I had a good, what was the ones on We called?
[40:37.280 --> 40:44.960]  Me. I had a good Me. Yeah. Do you have a good, I feel like a good Memoji or my Memoji is like
[40:44.960 --> 40:51.760]  really bad. Oh, mine's all right. Yeah. There's an easy way to pick a Memoji for me.
[40:52.560 --> 40:56.000]  Right. But it also looks exactly like Matthew Pansarinos.
[40:57.200 --> 40:59.520]  Right. Old dudes look kind of the same in their Memojis.
[40:59.520 --> 41:05.760]  Yeah, you just sort of, just black hair, you know, like kind of a beard.
[41:05.760 --> 41:12.560]  Right. You know, like a roundish face, eyebrows. I feel like people with glasses do really good
[41:12.560 --> 41:18.320]  Memojis or good like Bitmojis or avatars, like similar with the Facebook horizon,
[41:19.040 --> 41:24.240]  workplace avatar. But anyway, like you do it and you really do feel like that person was in
[41:24.240 --> 41:29.360]  your space. And like for someone like you, who I haven't seen in that amount of time,
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.480]  like I would love to have a meeting with you in that kind of space and you do it. I mean,
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.560]  you do it. I mean, there's some novelty to it and you're sort of like, okay, like this is not
[41:38.560 --> 41:44.640]  something we could do for long periods of time. But I do think with the right tools, and this is
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.760]  where like when I was doing a lot of the meeting stuff and you can pair your MacBook with it too.
[41:49.760 --> 41:54.320]  I don't know if you've seen that feature. I started the light went off in my head, which is like,
[41:54.320 --> 41:58.560]  if Apple does this, right, if Apple does the headset, which we all think they're going to
[41:58.560 --> 42:05.600]  do it at some point, they can do it so well, right? Because they control the computer,
[42:05.600 --> 42:11.040]  they control the phone. And there's all these ways right now with the Oculus Quest that they're
[42:11.040 --> 42:16.320]  trying to do it, right? That you can pair your computer. It does like a fake 3D computer in the
[42:16.320 --> 42:22.480]  space and it places the screen on top of it. I'm doing a bad job explaining this. I don't even
[42:22.480 --> 42:26.880]  think I think you showed it in your video, but I think I showed it in the video and it works
[42:26.880 --> 42:33.040]  horribly, right? It's so slow. You've got to pair a mouse with it. It's sluggish. Like I was using
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.600]  that. It was like the only way I communicated with my family during that period was like
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.640]  through iMessage on my computer through there. And it's so slow. It's just bad.
[42:42.640 --> 42:45.520]  And doesn't it look pixel-y too? Because there's...
[42:45.520 --> 42:51.360]  So pixel-y. Yeah, like it's just all pixelated. It's like using a remote desktop, but in the
[42:51.360 --> 42:58.400]  worst possible place. You know, remote desktops are usually laggy anyway. So the light kind of
[42:58.400 --> 43:02.960]  went off when I was doing that. I was like, if Apple did this, right? You'd have like seamless
[43:02.960 --> 43:07.920]  iMessage integration. You'd have an easy way to bring over your Safari windows and everything
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.760]  like that. Like you could see how easy it could all just sort of be set up in there. The question
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.600]  is like, do we want that? Why would you want that?
[43:19.600 --> 43:26.960]  Yeah, I don't know. And, you know, and the other factor with Apple getting into it is
[43:28.160 --> 43:30.640]  what do we think of Apple as a game company, right?
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.560]  Clearly they're, you know, in fact, the main reason that they're embroiled in the lawsuit
[43:38.560 --> 43:46.480]  with Epic is that they're gigantic in mobile gaming. Just, you know, I guess the biggest,
[43:46.480 --> 43:54.080]  by far, mobile gaming company with Google coming in second. But the Mac famously has never
[43:55.520 --> 44:01.440]  been, or at least not since like the black and white days of the late 80s when it was a very
[44:01.440 --> 44:10.640]  small cult market. You know, in the post Doom era, there have not been very many great Mac games.
[44:10.640 --> 44:16.720]  It's just, you know, so which one would it be like? Would it play like mobile or would it play
[44:16.720 --> 44:22.800]  like the Mac where they just can't get traction? Well, I think that's, again, the biggest
[44:22.800 --> 44:32.160]  opportunity for Apple, right? Like you even look at the Oculus app store and there are the top
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.880]  games, which probably your son would know more about this, which is the top games have not made
[44:36.880 --> 44:42.560]  their way to this platform, right? So you have some of the more fun games like the Beat Saber's
[44:43.120 --> 44:48.160]  and obviously also like Facebook or Meta's already tried to gobble up some of these, right? They're
[44:48.160 --> 44:54.480]  trying to buy these companies. And there seems like there's so much opportunity for another
[44:54.480 --> 45:02.320]  platform here that also can easily, in some ways, port over. So I've been wondering a lot about
[45:02.320 --> 45:09.360]  that. Yeah. And it's, you know, like the Mark Gurmans of the world are saying that the,
[45:10.000 --> 45:15.680]  I think Gurman's latest estimate is that they're trying to get it out by the end of next year. So
[45:15.680 --> 45:22.080]  like a year from now, we might be, you know, if they hit the target. It just seems so far
[45:22.080 --> 45:29.600]  away from me display wise though. It just seems like if you can't make. Well, I agree. I agree
[45:29.600 --> 45:36.000]  with like the tech and this year there's going to be the Project Cambria from Meta, which is going
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.920]  to have better, higher resolution display. It's going to have more cameras so it can do more
[45:41.920 --> 45:46.960]  augmented reality features like it will improve this MacBook situation, right? Like you'll be
[45:46.960 --> 45:52.880]  able to see more of what's in your space and have pass through. So that's all coming from Meta this
[45:52.880 --> 45:59.680]  year. But I think again, like you're saying, it's going to be this developer's race. And right now,
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.520]  there's really just Meta. I mean, yes, there's HTC, but that seems to be like the higher end.
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.160]  And I personally keep thinking someone's going to buy them. I know they've been passed around a lot.
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.960]  It just seems like HTC is coming at it from the gaming PC angle and Oculus is coming at it more
[46:18.960 --> 46:27.840]  from a mobile angle. I mean, I was going to say I don't follow Facebook closely. I follow it more
[46:27.840 --> 46:38.000]  closely than most people. But I always thought that Zuckerberg's interest in Oculus was primarily
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.880]  very long story, very short. They were a website and then mobile became a thing and they're like,
[46:46.880 --> 46:54.000]  Oh, well, shoehorn our website into an app for this Apple App Store. And then the App Store and
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.120]  truly native apps became such a big thing. And Facebook jumped on it, you know, total Bill Gates,
[47:01.120 --> 47:07.280]  like let's turn this company on a dime. Oh, let's this this phone thing is not an afterthought. This
[47:07.280 --> 47:12.880]  is going to be our main product. This is this is the main Facebook, right? And got very serious
[47:12.880 --> 47:18.320]  about it. And then he thought this sucks. I wish I owned the phone platform. And they tried it.
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.880]  They made a Facebook. That's right. Right. Amazon had a similar moment where Amazon made a phone
[47:22.880 --> 47:27.520]  because I think, you know, I went to all those events. They reviewed all those phones, you know,
[47:27.520 --> 47:34.080]  and they both gave up on it very quickly, which is the opposite of Microsoft, right? Microsoft
[47:34.080 --> 47:40.560]  traditionally makes a crappy first product, a slightly less crappy second product, and then
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.640]  just sticks to it for another year. And then version three is like, all right, you know,
[47:46.640 --> 47:52.960]  right. But that's, I mean, that's what's coming, right? I mean, that's been, I've covered it,
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.960]  everyone's covered it, which is this coming sort of Zuckerberg versus Apple versus whoever will be
[47:58.960 --> 48:04.080]  the third platform. I think, you know, it's certainly the two seem like they're going to be
[48:04.080 --> 48:10.000]  Apple and Facebook or Apple and meta. And then Microsoft seems like the likely bet, right?
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.080]  They've got the HoloLens, they've got Windows, they've already said they're going to enter there,
[48:14.080 --> 48:20.720]  but you know, who knows? But I think with Apple, it's clear, and I think this was the
[48:20.720 --> 48:28.240]  Germin report, which was gaming and communications. And I think that makes total sense. They need to
[48:28.240 --> 48:34.080]  start to do that, whether they have to do it publicly, I think they kind of have a tougher
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.200]  road about getting developers on board without doing it publicly, right? Like they can only do
[48:39.200 --> 48:44.240]  so much with what they've done with ARKit with, hey, build this for the phone, and then eventually
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.320]  we're going to make tools that make it easier for you to port to some sort of headset platform.
[48:50.320 --> 48:59.200]  I think that the big difference between mobile and PCs was, okay, the Mac came out in 1984,
[48:59.200 --> 49:05.520]  and it was clearly, if you knew what to look for, this is the future of personal computing.
[49:05.520 --> 49:12.960]  It's something like this. And Microsoft had Mac apps, right? Excel started as a Mac app.
[49:14.240 --> 49:20.320]  But they made Windows 1.0, which was a joke, then Windows 2, then Windows 3, which actually caught
[49:20.320 --> 49:27.200]  on and sort of started painting Apple into a corner. And then Windows 95, super famous,
[49:27.200 --> 49:32.080]  people lined up around the block like it was a rock concert to get their boxed copy of it on day one.
[49:32.080 --> 49:42.960]  But I feel like Gates stuck with that because the Mac never really became like a mass market
[49:42.960 --> 49:50.640]  phenomenon, right? It was like, oh, there is still room here to be the big gorilla in operating
[49:50.640 --> 49:56.800]  systems. Whereas with the time the Fire phone and the Facebook phone came out, I think Zuckerberg
[49:56.800 --> 50:01.840]  and Bezos, I think they were both, they're both so smart, so cutthroat. They looked at it and they
[50:01.840 --> 50:05.920]  thought, ah, it's too late. It's too late. We should have done this. We should have done this
[50:05.920 --> 50:14.640]  two years ago. There's no way this is entrenched. This is the way platforms work. iOS and Android
[50:14.640 --> 50:21.920]  are our phone platforms, period. And I think Zuckerberg, I think wisely, if he wants to own
[50:21.920 --> 50:29.440]  his own hardware platform, picking VR as the next target and hiring, getting the Oculus team and
[50:29.440 --> 50:35.120]  John Carmack and these super talented people. And it was really smart. It's like, this is a long
[50:35.120 --> 50:42.640]  play. The mobile, I wish we owned a major mobile platform, but too late. So let's not miss out on
[50:42.640 --> 50:48.000]  the next one. Yeah. And it may put them at a disadvantage, but it didn't put Apple at a
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.800]  disadvantage to not own the most popular desktop operating system when the iPhone came along. So
[50:52.800 --> 51:00.800]  I, I'm very interested in it all, obviously, by doing it for 24 hours. And like the point
[51:00.800 --> 51:04.400]  of that was like, that this is totally not ready. By the way, I was sick for like two days
[51:04.400 --> 51:13.360]  afterwards. You're like sick, like just like a, like vertigo. Yeah, like just like subtle
[51:13.360 --> 51:16.880]  headache for like two days. It was like, yeah, this was not the smartest thing I ever did.
[51:16.880 --> 51:23.680]  But I never saw like clearer where this is headed. And also, like, talk about a computer for your
[51:23.680 --> 51:29.600]  head, like very clearly that this is still like a really generation one, not even generation one
[51:29.600 --> 51:33.680]  computer for your head, right? Like the thing gets warm, the battery is horrible. Like what
[51:33.680 --> 51:39.280]  you're mentioning that like the the pixelation of certain things is you still visibly see it.
[51:40.720 --> 51:44.560]  You know, the controller and the accuracy of the hand tracking and all of that stuff is just like,
[51:44.560 --> 51:47.520]  okay, this is going to take a while. This is going to take a while.
[51:47.520 --> 51:52.560]  It's heavy for a pair of goggles. I mean, it's it just is what it is. But I mean, like you wouldn't
[51:52.560 --> 51:58.240]  buy safety goggles because you were going into a factory or floor or something like that where
[51:58.240 --> 52:03.760]  you have to wear goggles. You wouldn't wear just non computerized goggles that weighed this much.
[52:03.760 --> 52:07.680]  You'd be like, this is insane. Why in the world? You know, this, it's like my head's falling down.
[52:08.320 --> 52:12.960]  Like we put up with it now because it's the lightest the current tech can get.
[52:12.960 --> 52:18.640]  Away with, but clearly it's not something that is is meant for comfort.
[52:18.640 --> 52:24.800]  But also like in my like last, what is it? Probably last five to six years of covering
[52:24.800 --> 52:30.560]  VR because I did a big VR piece in 2016. I was just looked back at it and it was embarrassing
[52:30.560 --> 52:37.520]  because I was totally wrong. But that was the age of the Galaxy, the where you put the phone
[52:37.520 --> 52:44.000]  in the front was at the Galaxy. I forget what it was called, but Google had one too. Remember
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.080]  Google was like making them out of cardboard boxes and then they daydream. That was right.
[52:48.080 --> 52:56.320]  Google Daydream and the Galaxy VR. What was it called? I bought the Gear VR, the Gear VR,
[52:56.320 --> 53:02.000]  because yeah, Samsung names everything gear. It makes no sense. And that thing was like
[53:02.000 --> 53:08.240]  very heavy too. And you had to strap your phone to the front of it. And it was really bad.
[53:08.240 --> 53:12.560]  And then like on the opposite end, you had the HTC where, where you'd have to be tethered,
[53:12.560 --> 53:16.080]  right? Like similar to what your son has, but like worse. You had to put up the sensors in
[53:16.080 --> 53:21.280]  the room and you had to have a giant PC powering that thing. And that was only five years ago.
[53:21.280 --> 53:26.640]  And now we're like to like that kind of power in this smaller quest size headset, which is
[53:26.640 --> 53:29.520]  impressive. And that's what's going to happen. So what you were just were saying at the top
[53:29.520 --> 53:36.000]  of the show, which is the stuff will get smaller. Were you at the, you probably were at the Apple
[53:36.000 --> 53:43.280]  event where I think it was for the iMac Pro, but it was certainly for an iMac. And it was a,
[53:43.280 --> 53:51.680]  one of those smaller events at Apple's secretive secret townhome. But they had the HTC Vives
[53:51.680 --> 53:57.760]  hooked up to show how powerful the iMac graphics card was. And maybe it was the Mac Pro, maybe
[53:57.760 --> 54:02.800]  it wasn't the iMac, but it was either the iMac or the Mac Pro. But it was very interesting to
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.920]  me that they partnered with a company, you know, Apple isn't known for sharing their
[54:07.920 --> 54:14.000]  demo. This is with other companies' products, but they obviously did not have VR things to show.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.560]  And we in the invited media got to try some games and there was a couple other things. But
[54:21.520 --> 54:25.680]  one of the things I remember from that demo is I just could not get over the fact that if I looked
[54:25.680 --> 54:33.840]  down, I didn't have any legs. Which was this? The, it was like about four or five years ago.
[54:33.840 --> 54:38.080]  And it, and Apple, they just, it was like one of those things where they shuffle us through
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.440]  various rooms to remember that, you know, they have, they all have like a room just for sound.
[54:43.440 --> 54:49.280]  And it's, you know, they've, and, and they've got like an orchestral score from a major Hollywood
[54:49.280 --> 54:53.120]  movie opened in logic and they show you, you know, this is incredible. And they've got,
[54:53.120 --> 54:59.440]  you know, a gazillion dollar speakers set up, you know, so that sounds fantastic. And one of the
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.800]  rooms was like a VR room, but to do it, you know, there was no Apple VR products. So they used the
[55:04.800 --> 55:10.640]  HTC Vive. Right. And they had, they had like the, the sensors set up in the room. Yeah. Oh yeah.
[55:10.640 --> 55:14.960]  Yeah. Perfectly set up sensors, you know, perfectly calibrated. Right. Right. Because
[55:14.960 --> 55:23.200]  you basically needed like a, a, a room to do that set up. Yeah. It's going to get better. And it's,
[55:23.200 --> 55:29.840]  I, I, I kind of believe this end of 2022 rumor that we're hearing from more and more analysts
[55:29.840 --> 55:36.400]  and folks like Gurman, I just think that Apple is going to want to get on this developer train
[55:36.400 --> 55:43.200]  faster than it, you know, faster than the hardware is going to be ready. It is, it's, it's going to
[55:43.200 --> 55:51.520]  it's going to be ready. It is truly a genuine art form to know when to hit the go button and say,
[55:51.520 --> 55:59.600]  okay, let's, let's build this, this plan, this device, this all OS. Let's ship it. Let's try
[55:59.600 --> 56:05.760]  to ship it in eight months. It's a real product, not a prototype go because the right time to do
[56:05.760 --> 56:13.040]  it is not when the product is perfect. Apple watch. I think they probably would at least one
[56:13.040 --> 56:18.560]  generation too early in hindsight. I think that the battery life I agree with that was so bad
[56:20.240 --> 56:26.480]  that it was, you know, but it was close. Like, and by the time they came out with the series two,
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.120]  it, it really was, it was like, Hey, this is actually a much better product already.
[56:31.120 --> 56:36.640]  Uh, and I think with the iPhone, they came out with it at exactly the right time.
[56:36.640 --> 56:43.760]  It was just absolutely positively nailed it, even knowing that they were building it on the
[56:44.560 --> 56:50.080]  crazy slow edge network. Uh, you know, and it, it had battery life issues too,
[56:50.640 --> 56:57.520]  but it was so compelling and so useful. It was truly useful as a product right out of the gate
[56:57.520 --> 57:03.200]  in 2007 that it, it's, it was pretty well timed. iPad, I would say they,
[57:03.200 --> 57:05.600]  I would say they timed the first iPad extremely well.
[57:07.120 --> 57:11.280]  Yeah. And I think like this is going to be a, it sounds like it's going to be a different
[57:11.280 --> 57:15.840]  marketing position than any of those products. I mean, maybe most similar to a watch, right?
[57:16.400 --> 57:20.960]  Um, but we're putting this out there. We think this is a bet on the future. We
[57:21.520 --> 57:26.640]  want people to create for it. And I mean, that was a little bit of the, the watch messaging,
[57:26.640 --> 57:29.360]  right? Like they weren't sure what the watch was going to be. I mean,
[57:29.360 --> 57:32.800]  you look back and you're like that first keynote, they're like, yeah, fitness in there and
[57:32.800 --> 57:37.440]  notifications and this and that. And like over the years, they became way more focused on what
[57:37.440 --> 57:43.040]  the watch was supposed to be. I think with this too, I mean that, you know, the rumors is smaller,
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.120]  uh, just not, you know, not going to be a huge blockbuster product at first. And I,
[57:49.760 --> 57:55.120]  especially too, when you think about how long Cook and some of the executives have been talking
[57:55.120 --> 58:00.000]  about this space as an interest, what is the term they always use? We're highly interested in or
[58:00.000 --> 58:08.400]  we're, yeah. Before the Apple watch came out, he said, uh, I think at the all things D conference,
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.600]  one of them, he was like, the wrist is an area of interest to us. And I was like, that's actually
[58:13.600 --> 58:17.680]  kind of crazy because there's only two things you can build. You can build a watch or a fitness
[58:17.680 --> 58:25.840]  tracker and fitness trackers are like a Fitbit, especially at the time, like a 2014 era Fitbit
[58:25.840 --> 58:30.400]  told you the time they were technically watches. So really you're just talking about
[58:31.280 --> 58:37.200]  what's the priority of the product, how fitness first is it versus style first or something like
[58:37.200 --> 58:43.920]  that. Yeah. And I think they've been saying this for like three years now, at least about AR and
[58:43.920 --> 58:47.840]  not VR, but AR. And so that's, I think a little bit of the challenge too, where they have to explain
[58:47.840 --> 58:54.160]  to people, this is not the end goal, but we are building on this. Yeah. It feels like, I feel like
[58:54.160 --> 59:00.240]  a watch situation. The other thing, it's just a little bit, I'm going to say gossipy, but maybe
[59:00.240 --> 59:06.960]  that's not the right word, but, or Kremlinology, right? Like the old word from the cold war where
[59:06.960 --> 59:13.680]  there were these specialists who could read the propaganda newspapers coming out of Moscow and
[59:13.680 --> 59:18.640]  read between the lines, even though, cause it was all a bunch of bullshit, but if you knew what to
[59:18.640 --> 59:26.320]  look for, you'd say, ah, I see what they're doing. As an outside apologist, one of the things that I
[59:26.320 --> 59:32.480]  find interesting about AR and VR and a reason to be optimistic that it might ship next year is
[59:34.160 --> 59:41.360]  there's lots of reports ever since the get-go that project Titan has a huge amount of turnover
[59:41.360 --> 59:46.400]  leadership turnover. I mean, at the highest levels now, Kevin Lynch, the guy who's still is also
[59:46.400 --> 59:54.640]  running Apple watch has moved to take over just a huge soap opera saga of executive turnover and
[59:54.640 --> 59:59.920]  bringing Bob Mansfield back out of retirement because things had gotten out of hand. The AR,
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.440]  VR stuff under Mike Rockwell, who was, I interviewed on stage four years ago, five
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:12.800]  years ago, they've had no turnover whatsoever. So like whatever that team is doing seemingly
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.920]  is making Tim Cook and the rest of the senior executives think that they're,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.760]  you know, they're onto something. Yeah. And I mean, when I interviewed Federighi,
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.480]  one of the times last year I asked about it and he, you know, just gave us usual smirk that they're
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.080]  still really interested in, in it. You know, it wasn't sort of like one of those backtracking
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.000]  things and people on YouTube are definitely reading into that. I remember whatever the
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.600]  time code was, which was like, basically like, people were like, look at him say yes.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.680]  Look at him just be like, confirm that they are doing this with his eyes or something like that,
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:56.000]  somebody was saying. It was this year, right? It was one of your interviews with Craig Federighi
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.080]  where you asked point blank as the total pro you are, is he in line and interested in perhaps
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:08.880]  succeeding Tim Cook as the next CEO? And he got so embarrassed and like, you know, he tried to
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.400]  make a joke out of it, but it's like, I don't know. I thought it was a very interesting answer
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:20.000]  because he didn't, he didn't just, I don't think he was ready to be asked and Apple executives
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.720]  usually are extremely ready for any, any question. And I thought of that again,
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.720]  about two months ago, six weeks ago, when Federighi spoke at the web summit in Spain
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:46.720]  and a big, big conference over there and gave his impassioned pitch for why mandatory side loading
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:56.880]  for mobile platforms would be a terrible idea for legislatures to mandate. Boy, that sure seemed like
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:04.160]  I know he, you know, it seemed less about him talking about, I mean, there were technical
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:09.840]  aspects to his argument, but it seemed a lot less than his usual role as senior vice president of
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:16.560]  software. Like when he's on stage at WWDC, it's to talk about software when he's on stage at a
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:22.400]  product event, it's to talk about software, but they usually don't even bring him out. Like when
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.880]  like the iPhone introduction comes out because that's about hardware and they bring out someone
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.280]  like Kyan Drance, who's their product marketing senior executive in charge of hardware.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.600]  Yeah. Or Jaws.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.680]  Yeah. Or Jaws. So, you know, somebody, they obviously Apple's, you know, like I linked to
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.680]  it and just said, you know, this is not a little thing for an Apple senior vice president to travel
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:53.760]  all the way to Barcelona to give a speech at somebody else's conference, especially at this
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:03:00.160]  time of year where it's like release season for Apple software. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. His,
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:06.960]  his quote, I believe was insanity or something like that. Like, you know, that would be insanity.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.440]  Would I ask like, you know, your name is a successor and he said something like
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.760]  insanity, you know, that would be, he said that would be irresponsible insanity or something like
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:22.800]  that. Right. And he's just joking and deferring it. But I was very surprised at how many times
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:29.040]  they put him out this year. Not only obviously with me, I was, I was very, very engaged in both
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.560]  of the conversations. Both of the times we talked because they were around specific software
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.240]  features, but other things I felt the same way. And I, you know, part of that's that he's very
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.760]  good. He's, he's maybe the, you know, better than Cook in some regards in terms of talking
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.560]  and explaining things. I don't know who else they really have to do. They've got a lot of people,
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:56.160]  but he's very good. I would think that it would that that that particular speech once it was
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.720]  decided that Apple should send somebody over to do it and that they should send somebody
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:08.320]  senior to emphasize how, how it's like a, it's like a respect to the conference, right. As
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.400]  opposed to sending somebody lower who nobody's heard of. These are from the people who are
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:22.000]  keynote regulars at Apple. Cook obviously could have done it. And he's, you know, he, he's got
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.200]  his own style on stage, but it is a little reserved, right? He's not bad and he's not
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:37.440]  stilted, but he's not enthusiastic like, like Craig is. Phil Schiller could have done it,
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:44.880]  but he has not appeared on stage since taking the title of Apple fellow and no longer being
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.560]  senior vice president of product marketing. I'm not sure we'll ever see Phil Schiller on stage
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.000]  again. I'd love to, I think it'd be a fantastic surprise. He could have done it, but he's not
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.480]  there. But then that the only other person I could think of would be Jaws, who is sort of the new,
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.960]  the new Phil Schiller, senior vice president of product marketing. So I don't know, you know,
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.960]  how much debate there was within Apple, but I would think it would be one of those four.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:16.000]  Yeah. Yeah. And Craig's just very, very compelling speaker.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:21.200]  Yeah, he just really is. So I don't know. I thought that was pretty interesting moment
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:29.040]  as we reviewed Joanna Stern's 2021. Let me take another break here and tell you about
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.240]  a new sponsor on this show. Very happy to have them on. A short and sweet message. RevenueCat.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:43.600]  RevenueCat makes it easy to build and manage in-app purchases on iOS, Android, and the web
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:50.160]  with just a few lines of code. RevenueCat provides payments, infrastructure, customer analytics,
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:55.520]  data integrations, and gives you time back from dealing with edge cases and updates across the
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:02.080]  platforms. It is created by developers, for developers, and thousands of the world's best
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.560]  apps use RevenueCat to power their in-app purchases and subscriptions. I have a few
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.600]  developer friends who use it and who swear that all the built-in stuff, like what you just get
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:19.360]  for free from iOS or Android, let alone the web, where you don't really have like a centralized
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.480]  platform. It's just a huge amount of work to do subscriptions, to do in-app purchases,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.760]  to keep track of all this stuff. RevenueCat makes something that was like a sprawling
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:36.800]  massive complexity, very easy, tied up in a neat bundle. So my thanks to RevenueCat
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:43.760]  for sponsoring the show. Go to RevenueCat.com. That's it. RevenueCat.com.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:51.360]  Here it is. I've been putting it off. I probably mis-introduced you on the show because I promised
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:56.880]  you months ago that I would forever after introduce you as Emmy award-winning Joanna Stern.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.400]  Just put it in the list of the things that have gone wrong with this booking, John.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.240]  You'll be hearing from my people.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.240]  Well, I laugh because Jimmy Fallon introduced you to Wall Street.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.240]  It's true. It's true.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.840]  Emmy award-winning Wall Street Journal personal technology reporter Joanna Stern.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.360]  Columnist, but yeah.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:27.760]  Columnist. I forget. Emmy award-winning. I stopped listening after that. I was like,
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:35.760]  this is never going to stop. But you won an Emmy.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:41.040]  That is probably the most shocking thing of the year. Yeah, we at The Wall Street Journal
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:48.240]  won our first Emmy for this documentary I did last year, published honestly maybe this time
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:55.520]  last year, a little bit earlier, about a very, it's not the most uplifting topic that I've ever
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:03.760]  covered, which is death and technology. But yeah, I'm still in shock over that because that was a
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:10.800]  piece that I just became so invested in, and just to see it recognized was amazing.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:17.600]  Eternal, a tech quest to live forever. It is available on YouTube. I promise everybody it'll
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:28.480]  be in the show notes. It is good. It is touching. And your demeanor as the host of the documentary,
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:35.040]  I thought had the perfect tone of acknowledging, hey, this is a bit morbid talking about stuff
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:43.680]  like this, but where are we going with our digital legacies and what might be possible
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:53.200]  in the future to sort of preserve the sense of somebody? That feels too far-fetched for me.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.680]  I mean, I'm not going to say like in a thousand years it's not possible,
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.880]  but I don't think I'm going to live to a time where somebody can somehow digitize their mind,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.680]  die, and you still feel like your friend is still there. That doesn't seem possible to me. But
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.200]  it's obviously a thing that science fiction writers have been imagining since the beginnings
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:24.160]  of science fiction. Yeah, and how I envisioned the piece always was sort of like, look at what
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:29.600]  we have right now, like sort of as a step into the future. Like look at what we have right now,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.320]  which actually what we have right now is pretty much right now literally in the news because of
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:42.240]  what Apple introduced in iOS 15.4, 15.2, sorry, too many dots. 15.2 with the digital legacy contact
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.200]  feature, but sort of what all these tech companies have offered us right now. And then look a little
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:53.760]  bit beyond that where I feature a company called Hereafter where you can make an interactive voice
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.920]  bot. Really, it's basically like it works with Alexa and you can kind of talk and hear
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:04.080]  the recordings of somebody who's died. And then, hey, look like way out into the future to what
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:08.480]  this company is doing. They're doing it right now, but like maybe one day, I agree with you,
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.680]  it's very eerie and weird, where like we have humanoid robots that look like ourselves and
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.640]  they talk and sound and have our consciousness is what they say. So yeah, the idea of the piece was
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:27.440]  to put that in front of people, which is like, where could this go? And it follows one specific
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:34.240]  woman who is actually just had another health scare. Her name is Lucy. And if you watch,
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:40.400]  you get to know Lucy a little bit. She's in her 20s and has fought this terminal illness for her
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.640]  whole life. And she thinks a lot about digital legacy and has like made a lot of plans about
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.840]  what will happen to her social media account, how she made videos that when she passes,
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:54.160]  she wants those to be posted. And so it follows her to find sort of the right
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.280]  solution to something that she's been looking for.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.200]  Yeah, so I because that you can imagine, right, you could do that now you can you can
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.560]  sit your parents down with a camera and, you know, do like a little family podcast effectively,
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.480]  right? And just talk and and get stories out of family members while they're still around to tell
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:24.560]  the stories, right? I mean, and it is weird. And I think that part of I still haven't done it. So
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:32.400]  maybe it's fake praise. But like, I know my dad has these fantastic stories. My dad was
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.360]  absolutely miscreant student in high school and, you know, cut class. And
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.240]  he just has so many funny stories about him and his buddies figuring out that they could skip
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.400]  first period and because the teacher never took role and it was a lot of and they always sat in
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.520]  the back. And so they just went out and, you know, got sodas or goofed around or whatever,
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.120]  and then came in to go to second period and ran right into the principal of the school,
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:06.240]  who, you know, it's a cat was a Catholic high school, a nun. And it was like, he knew that
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.040]  they were like, they all knew the jig was up. And that's that she knew that they were out
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.960]  scooping off skipping class. I should have him on to tell the story. But to capture those stories
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.000]  and capture more memories. And, you know, and obviously that's Apple's thinking about it too,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.280]  with this legacy. What is it called? Legacy, legacy contact, yeah, legacy culture, which
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.240]  you can enable and actually was like hugely popular. I did a guide to it last week because,
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.280]  you know, this has been a topic that I've had I hit them a little hard last year because they
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.640]  didn't they didn't have a feature like this, right? Google's had a feature like this. Facebook's
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.360]  had a feature like this. All the password managers have had features like this, where you assign
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.120]  somebody and so when you die, that person you've assigned can then get into your digital data,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:59.200]  really. And so they finally released this feature this last week in 15.2. And I did a guide to it,
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.800]  and it's been hugely popular. People have from all over have been emailing just, you know,
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.880]  how do I enable asking questions about it all. But yeah, I mean, that similarly to you,
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  this prompted and again, you see in the documentary me to talk to my mom about
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:18.240]  how do I record her stories because I don't necessarily need her to be in a voice bot,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.200]  but I want to have those recordings. Right, right. Yeah, the voice bot thing is sort of
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.080]  a distraction. They capture these memories and then you can go back and look at them
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.840]  again 10 years after they're gone, 15 years after they're gone. Your kids can see their grandparents
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:43.760]  when they're, you know, there's, and there is clearly a lot of tech moves so fast that there's
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.960]  been a ton of digital rot over the years. It's sickening. I mean, honestly makes me
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:58.560]  queasy how many links from Daring Fireball to other articles and websites over the years that
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:06.160]  I've been writing Daring Fireball are now 404s. And that's just like articles about like Mac apps
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.680]  and stuff like that, right? I mean, it's like how many personal digital photos have been lost
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:18.560]  because nobody had the password to the iPhone where they all were. Exactly, exactly. And how do
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:25.120]  you create that on your own, right? Like you don't necessarily want to just inherit somebody's giant
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:32.880]  library of photos. Right. But, you know, and everybody pre-digital had family photo albums,
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:40.720]  or, you know, a lot of times, shoeboxes full of photos waiting to be organized into photo albums.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.400]  And, you know, maybe whoever was the organizer of the albums runs out of steam at some point. And,
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.320]  you know, then when they pass and their family comes in, they just find the shoebox of photos.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.360]  But there they are. You don't need a password to get into a shoebox of old family vacations
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  and family Christmases and birthdays and all of that stuff. And you can just sit there and go
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:08.000]  through them. I mean, it's, you know, the analog world of a literal shoebox of photos stinks in so
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  many ways. The cameras were terrible for most consumers. The lighting for anything taken in
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.640]  the dark. Look, you know, it's hard to believe how bad flash photography was at the time,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.800]  but the cameras were so slow that they had to use a flash. But they're there,
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.920]  and everybody can look at them. And, like, I mean, it sounds like just things like that can
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:38.560]  be destroyed, right? Right. I mean, fires, floods. Right. Right. So, and I actually did a year ago
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.800]  around this time, too, like sort of that similar piece, which is how do you preserve your family
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:48.080]  memories from way back when and make them digital? And then what do you do with the digital ones,
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.080]  right? So I did, like, even the guide to, like, how to use, how to update, you know, if you've
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.560]  got the slides, right, the 35-millimeter slides, and you want to bring those into the digital
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.360]  world, how do you do that? How do you scan lots and lots of photos to bring those into your
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:09.120]  digital library now? It's definitely a project, but it's, to my point, with both of these pieces,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:14.000]  all of these pieces is, like, we don't think about it. And what got me started thinking about it was
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.120]  I had some emails from readers about this topic, and then a producer we had hired was like,
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.000]  do you ever think about this topic? And started digging into it. And it turns out there's a lot
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.280]  that's happening there. We just don't talk about it enough. And the tech companies don't talk about
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:32.000]  it enough, because one, it's a weird thing to talk about. And two, as I've said many times, like,
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.480]  they want to deal with their active users. It's literally how they make money is the active users.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.080]  They're not necessarily concerned with the non-active users.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.880]  It is, it's like an inextricable part of human nature that we have a lot of trouble
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.680]  understanding that we're all going to die. Like, we know that we're all going to die,
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.920]  but you don't really feel like you're going to die. It's just innately uncomfortable. I think
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.920]  Apple's done a good job with it, from what I've seen. But even their language is a little stilted,
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:09.440]  like the, you go into settings, password and security. And then there's a section for legacy
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:15.600]  contact. A legacy contact is how they describe it in iOS 15. A legacy contact is someone you
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:22.640]  trust to have access to the data in your account after your death. That's not a bad language,
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:28.560]  but it's, it's a little cold for Apple. I don't know. I don't know, but I don't, I often, you
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.000]  know, I'm, you know, me, I have strong opinions on everybody's writing, but I don't know what note to
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.320]  send. You know, like usually if I see badly written text in a settings description, I can
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.680]  think of a better way to say it. I can't think of a better way to say it, except I also don't think
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:54.240]  that that's very, it's not encouraging, right? That to me is where it falls short, is it feels
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:00.560]  so cold and it acknowledges that you're going to die after your death. I sort of feel like
[01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:04.720]  it should be written in a way that more strongly encourages people to turn it on.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:09.200]  Yeah, I bet. I want to also like, to me, it's always funny, like who writes these things?
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:12.800]  How many lawyers did have, did they had to read it, right? Like,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.600]  I'm going to see what I had, how I can, because my phone is in airplane mode.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.920]  Also, another thing it should say here, but it doesn't because I've gotten this email from so
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:29.440]  many readers, is that you have to have two-factor on. Now you should have two-factor on regardless,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.040]  but it turns out a lot of my readers don't have two-factor on, so then they email me saying this
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.320]  feature does not exist in 15.2, to which I have to write them back and say it does, you just have to
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:44.160]  have two-factor on. Yeah, I wonder what the percentage is on that, and I kind of feel like,
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:50.640]  I don't know, I don't think, I want to say my mom has it on and my dad doesn't,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.640]  and it's one of those things where I should help them out and, you know,
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.520]  and maybe when I go through this, you know, make sure that they both have it on.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.120]  Yeah, you'll have to. Yeah, and enable this. It might be, so it's a good prompt both to set this
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.840]  up and a good prompt to make sure both of my parents have two-factor on. But I'll bet the
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:20.000]  percentage of iCloud accounts that don't have it on is staggering. I don't know,
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.200]  I don't know if I'd say a majority, but. I feel like you have to turn it on if you have a watch.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:32.320]  Yeah, there might be. Maybe some little things like that over the years where they've sort of
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:38.560]  turned up the temperature on, if you want to use this in conjunction with blank, you have to have
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.280]  two-factor on. Like, you've got to have it for the TV, I'm pretty sure too. And maybe for like
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.480]  AirTags? I don't know. And I'm pretty sure to use iTunes, like to purchase things? No, you don't
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.320]  need it for iTunes. You don't need it for purchasing? I don't think so, no.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.960]  But anyway, there it is. And it is, it's, you know, it's interesting. I'm not surprised you
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:08.000]  wrote a whole column about it because obviously you have an Emmy award-winning documentary proving
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:14.480]  your interest in the subject. I think it was well done. Yeah, and I actually think they probably
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:20.480]  have seen, so I actually wrote about this in our newsletter this week too, which is all of these
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:24.720]  iOS updates we've been seeing. And I've seen other people commenting on this over the last couple of
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.840]  months as there were the delays on SharePlay and there's been the delays on the ID. And I was sort
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.320]  of arguing, I wasn't really arguing. I was just saying like, there's good and bad to these updates
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:40.320]  lately. The good is that Apple just can release features when they're ready, right? They don't
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.040]  have to feel forced to just do it all at the beginning of the, you know, the September timeframe.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.040]  And I will also lump in there that I think it's good that sometimes when these features
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.160]  are not included in the main September release, I didn't make this point in the newsletter, but
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:01.360]  I'm making it now, so this is important for everyone to listen to, is that there's more
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.880]  attention to them, right? Because like, if we were talking about iOS 15 in the fall, we might not have,
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.480]  we were just glossed over this, but there's more, like they can hit bigger with a certain
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:18.160]  type of feature. I would say the same thing will happen with the digital IDs, the digital licenses
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.360]  when that happens next year. And then there's the downside to all of these updates, which is that
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.280]  like people get annoyed by updates and they're like, why am I updating again? And a lot of people
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:31.200]  like said to me on Twitter and stuff like, well, there's automatic updates, but a lot of people
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.960]  don't have that turned on. And people get frustrated when they're like, why did this thing move? Why
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:39.840]  is there a new thing? But yeah, those are my deep thoughts on the dot releases.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.480]  Yeah, well, it's like, welcome to software, right? It's like, you can buy like an old
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.040]  analog telephone and you're not going to wake up one morning and the buttons have moved around,
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.240]  right? But it's like, you know, that was actually like Steve Jobs's explanation for not putting a
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:59.360]  keyboard on the iPhone was, you know, once you put a button on, its buttons always there, software,
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:06.000]  you can move it around. And then the downside is obviously a lot of people don't deal well with
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:16.640]  change. I'm still in hindsight, a little blown away that, at the iOS 7 update with the totally
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:21.680]  new look and feel. You haven't gotten over that? No, it's not that I haven't gotten over it. It's
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:28.000]  just like of all the things to change, they changed literally every single way that everything
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:36.160]  looked in the entire operating system. And it's like the Mac OS X has evolved over the years,
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:43.200]  you know, and if you go from today's version and look at the first version in 2001 with all the
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:50.160]  crazy stripes and stuff like that, obviously there's a lot of change, but it was a classic
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.640]  slow-boiling frog where every, you know, they would tweak and modernize the look every few
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:02.240]  years. There was never a moment, you know, the classic Mac 2 at Mac OS X was that sort of leap,
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.280]  but it was also not something you were going to get automatically installed just by updating your
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.160]  Mac. It was actually most of the Macs that were in use weren't even capable, you know, you had to
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.520]  have a fairly recent Mac to do it, and it was a whole big process. You knew what you were doing
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:25.600]  when you upgraded from classic to Mac OS X. Like you didn't accidentally click a button, you know.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:31.920]  And I think Apple has been, maybe it was a learning from 7, right, that was so jarring to
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.520]  people. But Apple, and now I think Microsoft, have taken real hints from what Apple's done
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:44.160]  in the last number of years, which is add these features that change the look and feel,
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.720]  that change the aesthetic, but don't force them down your throat. A lot of them are optional,
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.440]  right? Like that was the huge thing with iOS 14, right? You could do the widgets if you want to,
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.520]  you could get rid of your homepage, the app pages if you want to, but you don't have to.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:06.160]  And I think they've done a great job of that. And again, possibly again, why we have more of these
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:10.160]  dot releases, because they had to add features like that, make them easier, and other things
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.480]  fall and slip, and it is what it is. I mean, I'm not crying that I can't get my digital ID
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:24.160]  right now. I can't get it anyway in New Jersey, so. And I think also to that, you know, Microsoft
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.280]  has, Microsoft is infamous for not doing it the right way, right? Like Windows 8 did not do it
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:36.640]  the right way. And they've learned, I mean, especially with Windows 11, this year is like,
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:41.520]  hey, remove this thing. You can do it if you want to. If not, you can put it back into the
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.360]  left corner if you want to. It's okay. You know, or you put things where you want it.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.600]  And maybe, I mean, I'm sure someone's going to listen to this and say,
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:56.320]  well, we shouldn't have so much choice and, you know, the company should be able to control more,
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.760]  but I don't know. I think Apple's sort of the guiding light on that.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.040]  JS. Yeah, and I think that the App Library feature from last year in iOS 14 is a perfect example of
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:13.680]  it. I think that it is clearly a better design for a home screen, especially for a platform
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.160]  where they'll be the first ones to brag about how many apps there are in the App Store and,
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.280]  you know, encouraging people to download and install as many apps as possible.
[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:33.600]  The App Library that you get, and I think it's set up with, if you don't upgrade your phone,
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.720]  if you just do a fresh install, you get the App Library by default, and you don't get
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:46.160]  an endless number of home screens that are, as you go from left to right, are less and less organized
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.760]  in any sort of fashion. The App Library is definitely a better design. I love it.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.600]  JS. Same. Yeah, and I only have two home screens now,
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.200]  and I honestly sometimes think about getting rid of the second.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  JS. I have three, and the third one is almost empty, and it's like new apps that I'm trying,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.120]  like a test flight for or something, and I want to get to it a little bit faster than spotlighting,
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.840]  but it is so much less cluttered than my old home screen. But I think they were right not
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.960]  to turn it on for people by default, and all of your familiar home screens are gone.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.440]  JS. Right, right. And it's the same kind of with widgets. Like, you didn't have,
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.600]  I don't think, you don't have to do it. But does it, I don't even think it shows up if you've,
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.920]  you have to know where to find it.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.880]  JS. Yeah, they didn't shove them down your face.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.400]  JS. Right? Like when they do the onboarding, they like tell you about it.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.920]  JS. Right. Yeah, and they didn't like rearrange your first home screen to put a big calendar widget
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.440]  at the top. It's still just whatever you had on your first home screen before.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.600]  JS. Yeah. I mean, my favorite piece, like one of my favorite pieces every year I do is the iOS
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:05.440]  piece. I just, I, it's the most helpful to people, and I love to be able to just go through and see
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.280]  what's new and tell people what they, you know, discover these things, even though a lot of times
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.720]  people do it on their own. But it's, yeah, and Jimmy Fallon watched this year. So I was pretty
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.280]  happy about it.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.480]  JS All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor. Oh, I love this
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.960]  company. Squarespace. Oh my god, do I love Squarespace? Not just because they sponsor
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:38.880]  the show regularly, but because it is just a fantastic place to go to host your website.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.880]  And everything you want to do with hosting a website, you can do a Squarespace, you can
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:52.960]  register a domain name, you can select a template, like a style, you can edit it, you can add
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:28:00.480]  features, you drag and drop. It's all WYSIWYG as you go. Once you launch your website, how do you
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:08.000]  update it, you go through Squarespace, it is a CMS, it has analytics, you can see how many people
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:15.040]  are visiting your website, where they're coming from, all of it, you can do at Squarespace. And
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:22.880]  again, I say it all the time, but it really is the my best advice for this is that I know
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.960]  that the sort of people who listen to my show are the sort of people who friends come to when
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.840]  they need a website, and they come to you and they're like, What do I do, I need a website,
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:40.160]  send them to Squarespace, I'm telling you, it'll get them out of your hair. It'll free them to
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:47.040]  do all the creative stuff they want to do on their own without needing to know HTML or CSS
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:55.840]  or JavaScript or knowing what the hell the difference is between HTML, CSS, JavaScript
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:02.080]  are you they don't even have to know, they just drag and drop the stuff, it all just works, send
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.440]  them to Squarespace, it'll be so great, it'll get them out of your hair, and they'll be so happy.
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:17.920]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show, just squarespace.com slash talk show. And when you

[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.760]  Did you see Dieter Bohn's springboard documentary?
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.120]  You know, I have not watched the whole thing yet. Every time I go to start to watch it, I get
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.320]  take it into something else. So I have I have it. I'm going to watch it in the next week,
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.960]  because I have time to watch something. All right, that's good. I don't usually spoil
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.920]  upcoming guests on the talk show. I'd like it to be a surprise when new episodes come out.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.960]  But I feel like this time, I have to assign homework, because communicating with Dieter,
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.280]  and as you know, it's very difficult for me to schedule.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.840]  Yes, yes.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:14.560]  Schedule one of these. But I am having Dieter on to talk about it. And we'll probably talk
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.400]  about it longer than the actual documentary, because I think it's about half an hour.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:25.920]  Half an hour. But basically, it is a springboard, the secret history of the first real smartphone.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:33.280]  And it's the story of Palm and the Palm Pilot. And it is so good. And as a nerd,
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.880]  I would love to get like the Peter Jackson version of it that's double length. But it does tell the
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:48.880]  story. And it's so interesting to me, looking back on time, how things that in my memory
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:54.160]  were actually were far apart, weren't very far apart at all. You know, like,
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:00.400]  Palm just wasn't even around that long, as at least as a serious player. It was like a flash
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:07.360]  in the pan. In a sense, right, there's like, I remember, I first got one, I got the handspring
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:12.400]  visor, which was, and you know, and it was another one of these companies that I always thought there
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:19.520]  were a lot of similarities between Palm and Apple. Certainly a similar aesthetic and a care for
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:28.000]  attention to detail in user interface design and the clickiness of the buttons. Handspring was,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:34.640]  but also in the 90s, they were like a corporate mess, right, Apple and Palm. And so like,
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:42.640]  Palm was a company. And then the leaders left and licensed the software and built their own
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:48.320]  competitor to the software, the handspring visor. And that's the first one I got, I think I got it
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:55.120]  in 2000. My wife loved it too. And they came in fun colors. I think I had an orange one,
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:02.640]  and she had a purple one. And so the Palm pilots were like these sort of grab drab, gray sort of
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:09.200]  sort of Newton-y looking devices, you know, with the plastic. Handsprings were much more fun.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.520]  They used these colors, had the same great software. If anything, it was better. They
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:19.760]  had like built-in apps that only came from a handspring. And they had like a cartridge
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:25.440]  thing at the top where you could buy additional hardware modules. So it did not have a built-in
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:31.600]  phone, but then they came out with a phone attachment. And I, of course, bought that.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:40.400]  And it took absolutely terrible, terrible black and white photos. But now I had a camera with me
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.400]  wherever I was, which was a game changer. Before that, I was an enthusiastic amateur film
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:50.400]  photographer, but I didn't have a camera that was with me all the time that I could put in my
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.800]  pocket. That was a huge game changer. What was this? Was it like 2000?
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:00.160]  Around that time, you know, and they were still around. And then famously,
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:03.840]  I don't think I linked to it yet, but one of the outtakes from it, famously,
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:10.160]  Palm was still around in 2006. And that was when they were playing around with like Windows Mobile
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.440]  instead of their own OS. And it's like, oh, man, this is terrible. The Windows Mobile,
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:21.360]  this thing stinks. It's just like Windows 95 shrunk down to a phone. Who wants that?
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.480]  Yeah, because I was too young at this point in life to know, but my only recollection of
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:35.200]  Palm and Handspring was like a friend of mine in high school's father had one of these. And
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:44.720]  then by 2006, I was out of college and a friend of mine, instead of getting into the BlackBerry,
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.280]  had a Palm with Windows Mobile, you know, with the stylus. And I thought that was super cool.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.640]  But that's like, no, I definitely did not have one of these.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:59.440]  So I don't want to spoil talking about the movie too much, because Dieter is going to be on,
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:06.320]  but I do want to, I wanted to put in a good word for it here, to encourage those of you who will
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:11.040]  be listening into subsequent episodes of the show to have watched it already by the time Dieter
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:17.280]  comes on so that, you know, we don't spoil it for you. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do the same.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:21.040]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna watch it and then I'm gonna listen to the show. All right, there you go.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:26.240]  Well, will you post the show by like end of next week? Because I'd love to listen to it
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:30.240]  when I'm in my car ride. I believe, I believe it will be out by the end of next week.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:35.680]  Okay, thank you for accommodating that for me. Here, last but not least, I wanted to talk about
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:42.400]  your interview with Elon Musk at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit. Yes.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:49.760]  This was a thing. It looked like a very nicely produced conference. Nice big stage.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:58.720]  Elon was at the Tesla factory in Texas, coming in remotely on a big screen above you.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.800]  Was that, how was that? I thought it was a terrific interview, by the way. I'm not just
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.000]  saying it because you're here. I can't believe it. I mean, I wish I, if I were half as good
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.600]  an interviewer as you, my show, these podcasts would be 30 minutes, but I would find it so hard
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.960]  to be, I'm on stage as the interviewer and I'm instantly nervous because I'm on stage
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:31.040]  in front of an audience, you know, and I find it hard enough to interview somebody on stage where
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.800]  we're both sitting there looking at each other and we're four feet apart and we're both talking
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:42.800]  in front of the same audience. Like I know, I'm not saying I'm great at it because I don't do it
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:49.360]  enough, right? Like a true pro, like, you know, Jimmy Fallon or those people, they interview
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:54.160]  people in front of a live audience every single day. So they're really good at the sort of
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.720]  managing your attention as the host between the guest and the audience. Whereas if I were talking
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:09.760]  to a giant 15-foot Elon Musk head on a screen, I feel like I would forget the audiences there.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.680]  I mean, so many things to say about the setup, but right, like this,
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:22.000]  what the internet also doesn't see is like, this is for our CEO council conference, which is one
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.080]  of our biggest conferences, if not like sort of the biggest conference of the year that we have.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.480]  We have a tech conference, we have a couple of others, but like this is our
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.640]  members pay to be in the CEO council and the Wall Street Journal puts on these special events.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.040]  And so we also had like a lineup. Musk was supposed to be the ending of that night. It's
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:43.360]  like the opening night, but there were some issues and things got moved around. So he was in the
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.800]  middle of the lineup. And what I should have said publicly is that we had the CIA director,
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:55.200]  William Burns, waiting backstage after that. And I should have just made a joke because like,
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:59.440]  you know, it comes off as rude and like the entire internet like ate me for it because they're
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.840]  saying, you were so rude to him, he said he would give you extra time. And I said, well, we have
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.640]  some other people at this conference. And I should have said, we have the CIA director who I don't
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:15.440]  want to piss off right now backstage, right? And I had in the front row, like my editors and bosses
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:20.320]  basically being like, you know, we have to move the show along, right? And like, I have a timer,
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.840]  like a big thing in the back. So I had actually pushed because it was supposed to be 30 minutes
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.040]  and I think it ended up being 38 minutes or something like that. So I extended but like,
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.080]  this needed an hour. Right? Right. Like, this needed an hour and he clearly would have given
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.280]  an hour. Yeah, he meant it when he said that. I noticed that. You know, and I actually think he
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.960]  was very engaged. I'd watched the prep I did for this one, which I do a lot of prep for all of
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:50.000]  these. But I did like, crazy prep. I also had like surgery in the beginning of or at the end of
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.160]  November. So I had a lot of extra time. And I just ended up binge watching his interviews from the
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:01.120]  last two years. And it's hard to get him sometimes engaged. So like, I was really happy almost
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.120]  instantly like, oh, he's engaged with this question. He's worked up, he's ready to go.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.400]  And so yeah, I mean, and plus, like, just like, I've got this group of CEOs sitting there,
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.800]  and I'm like, straining my head to look at the monitor because I don't I don't see him. Like,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.080]  I don't see him. Like, there was no other monitor over the camera. So then there was another camera
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.680]  that I'm looking at, because like, that's what he sees. Right. Luckily, like, I did tell the
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:33.760]  producers beforehand, you know, can I just go talk to him in the zoom thing on my computer first? So
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.480]  just like, he knows who I am. And he knows what's happening here. And we know there had been email
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.760]  chains, but it's not the same as just like, hey, we're about to sit down in front of a bunch of
[01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.560]  people. And, you know, I knew it'd be millions of people online, but I knew it would be millions of
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.840]  people online. Like, you know, and that we got to do, but not ideal. Yeah. Like I've been doing with
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.280]  some of these other interviews, which are video, it's a lot better. Like when I you know, when I
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:04.560]  did Craig Federighi, or I did Satya Nadella a couple months ago, it's like zoom and it's
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:09.200]  produced and we tape and then we edit. But this was live, which was great. I liked that it was
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:16.080]  live in some ways, but a lot less control over the end product. I like doing my live interviews
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:21.920]  too, like once a year, because it's incredibly nerve wracking. I've said this many times,
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.800]  but there's an energy that you can't replicate. I think my wife and I like to watch the, you know,
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:34.000]  the late night talk shows. And we, you know, and I think all of the ones that we watched,
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:39.120]  and we, you know, we'd skip around through all of them. I think they all did an amazing job coming
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:45.200]  up with ways to keep their show going while they were shooting every single night from the host's
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:51.840]  house, right? It's just Stephen Colbert's desk in his house. Jimmy Fallon had the best stuff.
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.840]  Yeah. And he had like a clubhouse and his kids would go down the slide at the end. I think,
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.840]  you know, but they all had to do that and I appreciate it. But it's like, man, once they got
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.240]  the live audiences back, it's like, boom, this show, pow, there it is. This is, this is actually
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:15.760]  better. Even if you're not there in the audience, it is, there's like a certain, and you know,
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.240]  and I think COVID made it worse because it was hard. It was somber, right? It's like,
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.960]  it's just this, it was this constant reminder that we're still all locked in our houses.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:32.720]  Yeah. No. And for me, like, you know, pre-COVID, I did a lot of stage interviews for the journal
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:37.920]  and I was always in person with those people, right? It was, I did Trevor Noah, I did
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:45.920]  Michael Strepfer at Facebook. I've done a bunch of bigger ones and being on stage with that person,
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.840]  like you get their vibe, you're looking at them, you can make them feel comfortable. You can bring
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:55.760]  in the audience, you know, ask like, what's the reaction in some ways? Like, and then we went to
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.400]  just all Zoom, which was tough. Like you're saying, like, you have to like, you don't have
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:04.880]  the audience, so you have no connection to the people that are watching. And now we have like
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.600]  this weird hybrid thing sometimes where you're one person's in person and the other with the
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:16.080]  audience, and then someone comes in like us getting a sort of big, big brother way. So I'm
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.280]  just hoping we'll go back to all in person, but I guess this is not the week to say that.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:34.800]  Yeah, fingers crossed. Let's see. Did you pick up on this or is it just me and where I noticed it?
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:43.280]  Where after the interview, the initial coverage seemed hyper-focused on a brief section of you
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:50.000]  and Elon Musk talking about what he would say to President Biden if he got to give him his advice
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.240]  on the Build Back Better Act. And that the initial coverage was sort of like, yeah, Elon Musk says
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.400]  he doesn't want the government giving subsidies to his competitors because he's, you know,
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:11.920]  his company's ahead and sort of painting him as a libertarian, selfish billionaire bastard.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:18.080]  And in context, I don't think that was a fair characterization of that segment of the discussion
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.040]  at all. I don't either, and I don't think that the characterization, which ended up being what
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:28.080]  others said about me, which is I'm a liberal, whatever, I don't want to say a word here,
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:32.080]  that, you know, is in support of this bill, is right either. I mean, I was just trying to
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:37.760]  challenge him and keep getting him to explain his thoughts. And frankly, like, he got there in a
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.920]  really interesting way. Like, he just, like, my favorite quote is, he's just like, delete,
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.480]  you know, delete, which is, like, that's the most, he had spent a little bit of time prior
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.800]  to that, like, winding up about it. And then he just gets it to the succinct bite, which is like,
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.880]  no, delete this, delete it all. Yeah, I think that, look, the focus is there because he
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.000]  hadn't said anything on this before. So I think that was why, like that. And then yes, I mean,
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.680]  he's a very divisive person, if not the most divisive person you could interview
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.280]  right now. So I try to remember that when I keep getting messages from Tesla fans and
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:23.280]  other Elon Musk fans that say I was rude to him. He is, I know, you know, people have compared him
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:30.240]  to Steve Jobs a gazillion times and, you know, they're founders, they're charismatic, they are
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.600]  good interview subjects, they think about a lot of things. And they're both were incredibly
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:44.880]  accomplished, right? I mean, it's crazy that Pixar was Steve Jobs's, like, other company sidekick,
[01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:53.680]  right? It is kind of nuts that Elon Musk runs the leading electronic carmaker in the country,
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:58.160]  by far. I think he said that they outsell all other electric vehicles two to one at the moment,
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:03.760]  or maybe three to one, I don't know. A spaceship company.
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:08.080]  COLLEEN O'BRIEN Yup.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:10.640]  PAUL Whose goals are, as he keeps saying,
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:16.720]  his goals are like to colonize other planets and put people into outer space to live. It's not
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.640]  just like, oh, we launch a satellite into low Earth orbit. That's what we do. I mean, like,
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:28.480]  pretty ambitious Starship project has had great success with it.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.600]  COLLEEN O'BRIEN Yup.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.480]  PAUL Well, and then...
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.760]  COLLEEN O'BRIEN And then brain implants.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:36.560]  PAUL Yeah. I was not aware of the fact that they had successfully
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:43.280]  put one into a monkey, and the monkey could play Pong, you know, the video game Pong telepathically.
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:50.960]  That's bananas. And the Neuralink one, I don't think I've looked at.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.520]  COLLEEN Was that a joke with the bananas with the monkey? I'm not sure.
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.560]  PAUL No. But the Neuralink one, I have to admit, I've rolled my eyes at a bit.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.200]  Because it's like, number one, I'm not going into space. You're not getting me up into outer space.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.480]  I mean, maybe by the end of my life. I don't know. But I doubt it. I have no interest in it.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:12.400]  COLLEEN Right. You know what will happen before you go to space?
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.320]  You being put in a Jita Mini and driven around the town.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:23.760]  PAUL But the Neuralink thing, my first reaction is a complete revulsion. And again, not to get into
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:29.760]  vaccinations and the politics around vaccinations. But one of the interesting things that anybody
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:36.480]  who's been paying attention over the last year, with vaccination rates around the world, is that
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:44.640]  there has always been enormous vaccine hesitancy in the public. And I also think, my personal
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:52.640]  theory is that a lot of people are a lot more afraid of needles than they would let on. Because
[01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.280]  would let on because it sounds like you're being a wimp by saying, I just don't want to get a shot.
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:04.000]  But people have an aversion to anything being punctured through their skin. And evolutionarily,
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.080]  that makes all the sense in the world, right? Like, up until like the last century,
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.080]  anytime you got your skin punctured, you were at serious risk for an infection that could wind up
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:23.760]  killing you. And putting something into your brain, it sounds crazy because nobody's ever
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:31.360]  done it before. But it's sort of like putting, you know, dead smallpox things into people's arms,
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:35.200]  and all of a sudden they stop getting smallpox because they have the antibodies.
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:44.320]  And his explanation about the medical, you know, purpose is that they expect that their first
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:50.880]  group of human subjects will be people like paraplegics, quadriplegics, and that maybe
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:59.120]  it would enable them to like walk again. Like, that's really crazy, you know, in a good way.
[01:46:59.120 --> 01:47:04.160]  But it's like, these are all from the same guy. And it's like, I get it that he pisses people off,
[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.880]  because, you know, I mean, Steve Jobs pissed people off. And it's like, I am not an Elon
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:17.840]  Musk worshiper. But it's like, you have to admit the guy is it being crazy productive.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.320]  SHAYA Yep. And I mean, that was like,
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:25.920]  sort of my goal with the inner, I mean, thoughts, you're making me think about my year of interviews
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:32.640]  in a really smart way. And my goal with this interview was to really just get him to talk
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:39.200]  about the projects and where he's, where they are, and get him to speak and open up about them.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.720]  Because it's really when he's the most passionate, you've watched these past interviews with him,
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.440]  and he's just, you know, get, he's just like, doesn't want to talk about certain things. Not
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.880]  because he doesn't want to answer, but just like, you can clearly see he's not passionate about it,
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.200]  right? And so you want to get him to the places where he's passionate. And yes, ask some tough
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:03.280]  questions about it. But, you know, after a year of interviewing folks from companies that are so
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:10.800]  telling you the marketing lines, and you got to really fight to get some answer to then talk to
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.960]  him who clearly does not care, you know, there's no no no press people behind the scenes are trying
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:22.080]  to tell him what to say, if they are, they're doing a horrible job. Like, it's just night and
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.240]  day. And it's as an interviewer, so much more interesting, and for the audience so much more
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:30.080]  interesting, because you're really getting a peek into like, this is this guy's brain. And,
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.560]  you know, one of the questions I wanted to ask him and we kind of got to is like, how does he work?
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.200]  But like, you know, how do you do all of this? Because I was trying to get to like,
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.080]  do you want to keep managing, you know, running Tesla? And he didn't really tell me much there.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:51.200]  But you get a sense of like, this guy, yeah, just like, visionary, and where his mind goes,
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:55.760]  and what he gets excited about. I think the best moment of the whole thing was when he when I asked
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:49:00.240]  him about Starship. And you could tell he his response was like, this is just such a tough
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.680]  project. This is the hardest thing, you know, you could see he's defeated by it. He's worked up to
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:10.160]  like, get this done. He wants, you know, he, he says he spends most of his time thinking about
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.080]  that problem right now. But to me, that was that section was the best. And why I let him keep going
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:20.080]  to because it was like, tell me why this is hard. And he's like, well, that's gonna take longer than,
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.440]  you know, 30 seconds. And then he pulls out the water bottle. It's like, oh, that's okay. That's
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.200]  okay. But yeah, in 30 minutes was not enough at the end of the day. Yeah, he said it, which is
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:34.080]  going to require a plus execution across the board in every single way. And you know that whatever
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.440]  you think of Elon Musk, you know, what he considers to be a plus execution is his highest high levels.
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.760]  I thought another great moment. And I don't even know if it's true. I don't care if it's true. I
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.880]  actually don't want to look it up because I don't I want it to be true. Was you were talking about
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:55.200]  his would that that segment talking about titles at Tesla? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And he went off on a
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:01.360]  tangent. He would know he started all these companies. But he according to him in US law
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:09.920]  to start like a C Corporation. The only the only officers you need are a president, a treasurer and
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.160]  a secretary, and that the titles like CEO and CFO are all just made up titles companies give to
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:24.320]  people with jobs, and they aren't like legally mandated. And the funny part about it, you called
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:32.960]  it out is it was at the Wall Street Journal CEO conference. I mean, everyone in the room left,
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:39.680]  which was good. Oh, I loved that too. It is just like, basically, screw all titles. And he said,
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:47.760]  you know, he's technocating it at Tesla. Yeah. But CEO is a meaningless title in front of the
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:55.760]  biggest annual conference of CEOs. I thought that was pretty funny. Yeah, it was I mean, yeah,
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:03.200]  he was he was very entertaining. And definitely wish I hope I get 30 more minutes with him next
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.160]  year or an hour. Well, back I did email him to ask him for an hour next year. So we'll see.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:13.600]  All right, there we go. Well, that about wraps it up for me. That's that's my full agenda.
[01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.680]  I mean, I haven't, I feel like we didn't we, I mean, I've listened to the shows,
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:24.640]  we've talked about Mac books and stuff, but we didn't talk Mac books, we should do that.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:30.000]  Let's do an extra bonus round here. You've got to be happy with the new Mac books, right?
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.400]  I'm very happy with the new Mac books. I'm using the 14 inch still, which I the review unit,
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:42.240]  and I'm gonna pack it up and send it back and decide if I'm gonna buy it. You know,
[01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.040]  I will say the 14 inch battery life, because I was using the 16 inch for a couple of weeks.
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:52.080]  The 14 inch battery life is just no nowhere near with that 16 inch.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.280]  Right. And it's, it's better than any other Mac book you've ever had.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:52:02.880]  But you got used to something even more. Well, the 13 inch Pro with M1
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:10.320]  is actually longer than this 14 inch, I think, or I did the battery tests and it was and even
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:17.520]  in use now, I think is it is longer. But I still like just love this, everything else about this
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.920]  so much more than the 13 inch. So do I just go with the 13 inch, which is I mean, do I just go
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:25.840]  with the 14 inch, which I think the answer is yes. Yeah, that's what I'm that's what I purchased for
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.400]  myself. That now that we've lived with it for a while, what are your thoughts on the notch?
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:37.680]  Yeah, I'm so used to it. I did. I did download that. Notch Meister.
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:40.160]  Yes, it hangs Christmas lights from your notch.
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:46.800]  Yeah, yeah. It's great. It's I mean, I but I hadn't thought about the notch honestly,
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:50.640]  till I saw that post on on your site. So yeah.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:59.280]  I now have to add that to the show notes. But free utility from my friends at the icon factory
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.120]  led by Craig Hockenberry.
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:06.880]  Now that much does not bother me. Does it bother you? I mean, I, you know, they'll get rid of it
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.440]  at some point. And it's gonna be gone. And we'll never, you know, people will remember the notch
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:11.760]  version.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.120]  I wasn't bothered right from the get go. Like, and it's interesting. I don't think I don't think
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:23.120]  I put this in my review, because I felt like I didn't want to, with that time crunch of trying
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:29.280]  to hit the embargo, and you've only got six days, and maybe it's more like five and a half days,
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.600]  because you got to wait for FedEx to show up now because you can't just leave the event with the
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:41.440]  review unit in your hand. I didn't want to make a long term impression of it. But basically,
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:47.360]  it took me a lot longer to get used to the iPhone notch back when the iPhone 10 came out,
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:53.280]  and that annoyed me longer. And I just thought, man, this is, I don't know, wouldn't this just
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:57.840]  be better to even if it doesn't go edge to edge to just make the black part at the top just go all
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:05.200]  the way across. And eventually, you know, I turned around on it, and I don't really see it anymore.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:09.840]  And I kind of like the way they squeeze stuff like the time and the cellular signal up there
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.320]  and the ears, whatever you want to call them next to the notch. With the with the MacBook one,
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:20.000]  I felt like the menu bar is the perfect place for something like that. It's, you know, I are there
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.920]  a couple of apps, like Xcode, where the menus are so there's so many menus that they stretch across
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.120]  the notch. Yeah, but it's kind of fun the way your mouse just like teleports across it as you're
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:37.040]  dragging across the menu bar. Like, you know, I'm fine with it. I love I love computers.
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:44.960]  Yeah, no, I mean, I same here. I'm just I just gotta pull the pull the trigger and buy it. But
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:52.880]  the Yeah, the other thing is and we we messaged about this a couple months back is now it I,
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:59.680]  I use the iMac for a while and I got really used to that iMac display the the 21 inch iMac
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:08.240]  or 24 inch. Yeah, sorry, the 24 inch iMac. And I, you know, sent that back. But I miss it. Like,
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:15.040]  I miss that display. And I miss the setup of that. And so I just really want Apple to make that
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:21.200]  monitor. Yeah, there's a rumor. There was a rumor last week that came out of LG, I forget who, you
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.000]  know, one of these rumor experts on Twitter, but basically it's saying claiming that LG is working
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:34.800]  on like, at least three upcoming monitors. And it's unclear, like one of them almost certainly
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:43.120]  is for the bigger iMac. And there's another one that they're going to update the $5,000
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.920]  Pro Display XDR and it's going to have a built in iOS computer in the back for some reason.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:55.360]  But just if that third one is just a standalone desktop monitor that you could plug your MacBook
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.080]  into, I'll be so happy. I don't even care. I used to have a strong opinions like, well, I hope it's
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:06.240]  at least 27 inches. I don't care. Just give me the 24 inch one from the iMac. Just something though,
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:12.560]  where I could get an Apple quality display. And just like the design of it, like I went back to
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:17.360]  my LG monitor. Speaking of LG, I have a nice LG 4k monitor and I set it all up, you know, I've got
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:21.360]  the mouse and the keyboard and everything. It's just not the same. Yeah. And I'm at that point,
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:25.440]  you know, on that I got used to the chin, right? Like I think actually on the last,
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.560]  when I was on here last, we talked about the chin and I was like, oh, it's so ugly. But I got used
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:35.280]  to it. That's like, okay. Like I definitely got, I was more bothered by the chin on that iMac than
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:41.840]  I was by the notch on the MacBook. I guess I was too. I got the orange one. What color iMac did you
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:47.920]  have? Blue. Blue. I remember that from your video. Remember? And I was like, yeah, it's like reminding
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:54.000]  me of like baby blue. You know, like you get like the blue stuff for your baby is you have a boy and
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.840]  everyone gets you blue stuff and it's like a little. Yeah. When it first came out and I was
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:04.560]  using it, the chin didn't hate it, but I thought it was distracting. I thought I was sort of one
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:11.440]  foot in the camp of, I would like to see, I mean, surely they made prototypes without the chin
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.040]  that were slightly thicker to accommodate the stuff that they wound up putting in the chin.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.760]  And it's like, boy, I'd sure like to see one of those. And no, I think they made the right
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:27.280]  decision. And I think it shows how many times internal to Apple, they iterate and iterate and
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:34.640]  use these things. And if they realize the notch is okay on the phone and on the MacBook, they can
[01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:42.960]  realize in that design lab, you know, that the chin is fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I want that
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:48.960]  monitor. That's my, my big, like Apple did a lot this year on Macs. I'm not going to complain.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:54.320]  They did some great stuff, but that's what I want to see next year. Yeah. Something that you just
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:58:00.080]  2022, some kind of monitor. Yeah. Some kind of insta buy, just take my, just take my money and
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:04.560]  get me this display display. Yeah. And like, you know, it will have all the docking stuff. Like
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.480]  it'll be the thunderbolt of whatever that year was. It will be of the 2022. Right. Give me the
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:16.000]  thunderbolt display for 2022. Exactly. Well, anyway, thank you for being here. I always
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.920]  appreciate your time. Have a good holiday season, the new year and everything like that.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.520]  Best to the family. And let me. Same to you. I look forward to hearing a bit from your booker
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:32.880]  for my next episode. And where I will be the host. And let me thank our sponsors. Are you
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:37.440]  going to do the sponsor reeds? Nah, I can't do the sponsor reeds. Yeah, I see you can't do the
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:44.960]  sponsor reeds. I'll have to break in. I'll have to do them in post. That's true. Memberful,
[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:52.160]  where you can monetize your passion with membership. Revenue cat. Oh man. Where they make
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:58.160]  it easy to build and manage in-app purchases and subscriptions on iOS, Android, and the web. And
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:04.880]  last but not least Linode, the web host and server infrastructure that I use to host during
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:07.680]  Fireball. My thanks to all three.
