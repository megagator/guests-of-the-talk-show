[00:00.000 --> 00:03.120]  Let's just get right into it. I feel like you're going to give me an earful about Skype.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.040]  I don't know. I just feel like who uses Skype anymore?
[00:10.080 --> 00:19.280]  You know, I had a friend just text me yesterday. And he had like a link to somebody who's it's
[00:19.280 --> 00:23.840]  just like a random tweet that was just like, you know, it's kind of hard to believe that Skype
[00:23.840 --> 00:29.840]  dropped the ball on video conferencing because they had such a huge lead. And I think that's so
[00:29.840 --> 00:40.320]  true. Because when Skype was new, the fidelity and latency, low latency were just game changing.
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.200]  Honestly, I mean, I don't know how in the early days of me podcasting, because I have been
[00:45.200 --> 00:52.160]  podcasting relatively long for the industry, like my old talk show with Dan Benjamin. I think we
[00:52.160 --> 00:56.800]  were doing that in 2007. He basically invented podcasting.
[00:58.560 --> 01:03.840]  I would never claim that because then Dave Weiner will get angry at me. And I do not want Dave
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.440]  Weiner, of all people angry at me. He invented podcasting. Let's just say that. But, but Skype,
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.280]  it was really made it possible in a way for remote, you know, and I, you know, I don't know
[01:15.280 --> 01:21.120]  anybody who lives near me who I want to podcast with. So it had to be remote. 100%. So here's a
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.360]  couple of fun facts about Skype. One, I got my start in tech working at a PR agency on the
[01:27.360 --> 01:34.640]  Skype client. So I was very interested in Skype. And I was very interested in the hardware that
[01:34.640 --> 01:42.240]  Skype was like sort of partnering with. And so my job was to pitch tech journalists uncovering
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.760]  these like new mics and webcams. And I realized when I was doing that, that this is not a good
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.040]  job for me. I would rather be reviewing these types of things. That's fun fact number one.
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.360]  Number two is I wrote a column this week about how we actually should be cutting back on video
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.400]  calls like that nonstop video calling has to stop. And it was about audio calls, right? Like
[02:02.400 --> 02:06.720]  that makes sense. Like we should just make audio calls. We before the, when I called the pre
[02:06.720 --> 02:10.960]  pandemic era, we just made calls. We would just be like, did you have a second? Can I give you
[02:10.960 --> 02:16.960]  a call? We didn't say like, can I give you a video call? Anyway, I got in touch with Skype,
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.400]  or I reached out to Microsoft to get in touch with Skype. And nobody wanted to talk about Skype.
[02:22.400 --> 02:28.640]  Like, they were like, hey, have you heard of Microsoft Teams? They didn't say that. But like,
[02:28.640 --> 02:31.680]  you know, they were like, here's all the new features in Microsoft Teams. And it's like,
[02:31.680 --> 02:38.320]  but any stats on Skype and people using Skype for just audio calls, as like radio silence,
[02:38.320 --> 02:45.440]  no one wants to talk about Skype. I totally agree about the video call thing. And I will
[02:45.440 --> 02:52.480]  also admit, though, that I'm in a position of extraordinary privilege, because I would say,
[02:52.480 --> 02:59.520]  as a someone who does their entire job, typing at a computer, I have probably had the fewest
[03:00.160 --> 03:05.760]  minutes on video calls of anybody I know in the last 14 months.
[03:05.760 --> 03:10.160]  Because I change your sentence from before, which is I'm extremely privileged not to work with so
[03:10.160 --> 03:17.120]  many people. I don't want to work alone. I don't work with anybody, which is it is a privilege,
[03:17.120 --> 03:22.080]  I have to say, you know, it can be a pain when it's a bunch of chores and stuff I don't want to
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.960]  do. And it's like, well, there's nobody else to do it. So guess who's, you know, emailing sponsors
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.800]  about bugging them for assets and blah, blah, blah. And it's, you know, but no video calls.
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.560]  And I have friends, you know, everybody, I mean, everybody's on video calls, but I have friends
[03:36.560 --> 03:42.720]  and and I think the same thing now I have had, and always do have, I do have a fair amount of phone
[03:42.720 --> 03:47.760]  calls, you know, you know, you got to talk on the phone, I find a phone call so much less stressful
[03:47.760 --> 03:50.000]  than a video call. I really do.
[03:50.800 --> 03:53.440]  And I and I pointed all these things out in the piece, especially like,
[03:54.880 --> 04:00.400]  I feel like right now, and I tried to make this point in the in the column, which is that it's
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.840]  like zooms are exhausting. And so the best like it's sort of like the leftovers, the table scraps
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.160]  that are leftovers, like, okay, do an audio call. But there's all these reasons and audio calls
[04:10.160 --> 04:14.880]  actually can be better than a video call. And we don't really think about those. I mean, for me,
[04:14.880 --> 04:17.120]  the biggest one is like, I can get up and walk around.
[04:18.000 --> 04:25.840]  Exactly. And you, you can do some silly, stupid stuff that it doesn't mean you're not paying
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.440]  attention. But you can just sort of, you know, I don't know, like, if you just need to carry
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.000]  something from one room to another, you can do it while you're on an audio call, you know,
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.720]  you just need to the kid left something out in the living room. Let me just take it into the kitchen,
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.320]  you know, put it on the right and you can like motion to everyone like be quiet. I'm on the
[04:44.320 --> 04:49.840]  phone, you know, like you can't you can't do that in the video call. Anyway, I love video calling
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.840]  FaceTime and all other video calling is amazing. And I talked about that in the piece, but we don't
[04:55.840 --> 05:00.480]  need to do it all the time. Yeah. The other thing about Skype versus zoom and the headstart Skype
[05:00.480 --> 05:05.520]  had and should have been able to keep technically is to me, and it's a little thing, but it's the
[05:05.520 --> 05:11.360]  sort of little thing that really bothers me. Skype is a much better name than zoom. I guess
[05:12.160 --> 05:18.080]  you're not zooming anything. Whereas Skype is a made up name. And it's a great made up name.
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.560]  It rolls off the tongue. It's good for a verb, you know, let's Skype over this.
[05:23.600 --> 05:29.920]  It and I feel like it even because I feel like we've gone through these phases of it becoming
[05:29.920 --> 05:35.040]  the verb, right? Like, Skype was like, oh, we should get together and Skype right, like with
[05:35.040 --> 05:38.880]  early days of video calling, it was Skype, but then FaceTime came along. And I feel like most
[05:38.880 --> 05:45.200]  people were like, if you had an iPhone, let's FaceTime. Or have you and at least in my house,
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.200]  too, when we had a kid, everyone wanted to FaceTime with us, right? It just became the
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.840]  default. And then through the pandemic, zoom became the default because it was this group
[05:53.840 --> 06:00.560]  feature. I think that zoom really marketed the grid and the like, I mean, it feels like almost
[06:00.560 --> 06:05.440]  they like invented it, but we know they didn't the group the grid, right? They're just like,
[06:05.440 --> 06:08.960]  hey, everyone lives in a box. And this is the best way to see everybody.
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.480]  It's always makes me think of the Brady Bunch. But it's like, well, what if the Brady Bunch weren't
[06:14.480 --> 06:20.960]  a bunch of kids? It was a bunch of colleagues and peers. And also, there are 20 of you,
[06:20.960 --> 06:25.920]  instead of nine. But it always looks like the opening to the Brady Bunch to me and people are
[06:25.920 --> 06:31.440]  looking around and everybody, you know, most of the people are poorly lit because they're lit by
[06:31.440 --> 06:39.680]  a laptop screen. And most of them, people in my circles, have MacBooks with shit cameras,
[06:39.680 --> 06:45.360]  and the angles bad because the laptop's down at their desk. And so it's just like the most
[06:45.360 --> 06:48.400]  unflattering- They look craptastic, right? Was that it? Craptastic?
[06:48.400 --> 06:52.720]  Yeah, craptacular. Right, every time I can't, I can't-
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.520]  Now I can't remember which one's mine and which one's yours. This was-
[06:55.520 --> 06:57.920]  I don't either. This was our last podcast.
[06:57.920 --> 06:59.120]  Well, they're both good words.
[06:59.120 --> 07:01.360]  You know what we should do here? Just lift the old podcast and
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.360]  like paste it in here and no one's going to know the difference.
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.560]  What do you think while we're on it? This is not on my list. I don't really have much of a list,
[07:10.560 --> 07:18.400]  but because I figured we'd just go off on tangents like this. Now that we're pulling out of this and
[07:18.400 --> 07:26.320]  you know, we've gone through this year plus of the pandemic, what about FaceTime? Like,
[07:28.800 --> 07:36.320]  it's kind of conspicuous now that it's over that FaceTime really had no role in anybody's
[07:36.320 --> 07:42.400]  professional- And I'm, of all people, know lots of people who their entire circle is all on Apple
[07:42.400 --> 07:48.720]  platforms. So the fact that FaceTime is Apple only isn't even relevant to this, even if you wanted to
[07:48.720 --> 07:54.320]  say that. Even people I know who are Apple only don't use FaceTime for professional video context.
[07:55.520 --> 08:01.040]  Well, I think a couple of things. I think for professional use, I totally agree. And also,
[08:01.040 --> 08:06.320]  like a couple of colleagues that I work with who don't have great cell service will like FaceTime
[08:06.320 --> 08:11.520]  audio. And in fact, in this column, I said, I think FaceTime audio is just the superior audio
[08:11.520 --> 08:18.000]  quality. If you get two really good FaceTime audio connections, it's superior. You're like,
[08:18.000 --> 08:25.440]  are you in the room with me? It is a crazy good quality. So I do that with some colleagues that
[08:25.440 --> 08:31.440]  you know, either are upstate and living in places that they're just don't have the best service,
[08:31.440 --> 08:38.720]  cellular service. But for sure, during the pandemic, a lot of our personal contact,
[08:38.720 --> 08:42.240]  you know, especially the first number of months where we couldn't see my parents, we were pretty
[08:42.240 --> 08:49.440]  much always on FaceTime. And I'm sure that Apple saw just crazy surges in that personal type of
[08:49.440 --> 08:55.200]  usage of FaceTime. Yeah, yeah, that is true. And I can actually verify that from some folks
[08:55.200 --> 09:03.280]  I know at Apple that FaceTime usage spiked early, and stayed crazy high. And, you know, it felt like
[09:03.280 --> 09:10.320]  a feather in their cap, like, hey, we always hoped we would be able to handle a level like what we're
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.640]  seeing, but we are handling it. And it all just seems to work. And nobody really thinks about it.
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.800]  And we feel good about it. So FaceTime as a personal thing, talking to parents, you know,
[09:20.800 --> 09:25.840]  that sort of thing, talking to just people you would normally have seen, but you couldn't see,
[09:25.840 --> 09:29.920]  because we were in our, what do we call them cocoons, our pods, you know,
[09:31.760 --> 09:37.920]  it worked great for that. And that is what it was designed for. And I think talking to some people
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.880]  at Apple, they're like, well, FaceTime just was never designed as a business tool. And, you know,
[09:44.160 --> 09:47.760]  it still isn't, you know, we just didn't do it. It might be interesting to see what they do with
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.560]  the Mac app in the future. I think, also, it's so clear. I mean, this is just a funny thing about
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.720]  the Mac app. And I'm sure you've thought about it. It's just like it defaults to the vertical
[09:58.720 --> 10:08.160]  view. Yes. It looks like the like phone app was just put on the Mac. Group FaceTime still
[10:08.160 --> 10:15.280]  basically sucks. They've done some things through the pandemic. They lose iOS 13.5, where they
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.360]  fixed some things for Group FaceTime. And then in 14, they changed to like, you know, the bubble
[10:21.360 --> 10:28.480]  resizing, which was kind of a mess, but still not great. Right? Like, maybe something we see at W3C,
[10:28.480 --> 10:33.360]  I would assume. Yeah, something related. Yeah, because I think that the original Group FaceTime
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.960]  implementation was technically impressive, you know, and it was a lot of people, right? Right.
[10:38.960 --> 10:43.440]  So a lot of people, I think up to like 27 or something. Yeah. And I remember, I think I remember
[10:43.440 --> 10:47.360]  like, my tweet was something snarky, like, I don't know, 27 people. So this is a, you know,
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.800]  that's nice. But little before the pandemic, did we know like, we would actually ever want a group,
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.840]  you know, video call with that many people. The implementation was like, too cute by far,
[10:57.840 --> 11:03.040]  though, with all of the way that people were moving around based on who's talking and,
[11:03.040 --> 11:12.960]  and it, it was like, I don't know, like, it was purposefully trying to keep you confused as to
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.280]  which person was where because every time somebody talks, and then I think they kind of realized,
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.360]  like, it looked cool in a demo, it was sort of like a UI that worked best on stage in the demo
[11:23.360 --> 11:29.440]  where they unveiled it. And it's like in practice, now you kind of want something simpler and more
[11:29.440 --> 11:35.840]  stable, where if Joanna is in the lower left corner, she stays in the lower left corner,
[11:35.840 --> 11:43.760]  you don't want her booping and bopping around the screen. Totally. And they, the improvements on
[11:43.760 --> 11:48.400]  Mac, I think can go hand in hand with the improvements in the webcam stuff, too. I mean,
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.040]  it's, you know, if there's some tie in there with the improvements and quality. And, I mean, you
[11:55.040 --> 12:03.360]  you've, are you still using the iMac? I am, but I've never really, I'm not using it as my full
[12:03.360 --> 12:10.240]  time machine. I have it set up and I set it up in Amy's sort of, I wouldn't call it an office,
[12:10.240 --> 12:14.320]  but like her little private room where she can have stuff because she had like a nice orange
[12:14.320 --> 12:19.600]  desk and I got an orange iMac and it looked really nice there. And she wanted to try it. She hasn't
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.480]  had an iMac in years. She's been like on the MacBook Pro style since we moved to a new house,
[12:24.480 --> 12:29.840]  like four or five years ago and has been thinking for years that she should get an iMac for her
[12:29.840 --> 12:37.040]  little room upstairs. And I was like, you should wait because it's like one of those things where
[12:37.040 --> 12:42.080]  it's like, how can I have gotten this old and, and not realize that, you know what, if you need
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.080]  a computer, buy a computer, stop thinking about the future. You're going to wait forever. Like,
[12:46.080 --> 12:52.000]  because I thought like four or five years ago, Apple Silicon Macs were coming 2018, you know,
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.160]  like this is going to happen because I know they're frustrated with Intel and I know their
[12:56.160 --> 13:01.680]  iPhone chips are already benchmarking faster than MacBook Pro chips. So this is going to happen. And
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.960]  then, you know, we had to wait till last year. What year did you tell her to wait in? Like 2010?
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.800]  I don't know. I didn't have any gray hair at the time. So it was a long time. I don't know. Yeah,
[13:10.800 --> 13:14.960]  probably. No, I would say like five years ago or something like that. So we've got it up there.
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.560]  And, you know, and it is it's one of those things that that it stuck out to me. I didn't put it in
[13:20.560 --> 13:27.840]  my review. But it still is one of those like, Hmm, why I get it with the iPhone, but the iPad
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.280]  and I know it's this is like one of the most common requests is how come on the Mac, you can
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.840]  set up two user accounts, and it they make it really easy to switch between them. And on the
[13:37.840 --> 13:42.880]  iPad, you can't like you can't just say this is a family iPad. And here's an account for
[13:43.760 --> 13:46.960]  one of your kids. Here's an account for another kid. Here's an account for
[13:46.960 --> 13:54.000]  the parents. It's a weird limitation of iPad because I know that people have, you know,
[13:54.000 --> 13:59.600]  iPads they want to share with their kids. And setting up the iMac where she had an account and
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.000]  she could use it and give me her thoughts on on how to use it. And then I could set it up and use
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.800]  it. It's like, wow, I wish I could do this with iPads.
[14:08.400 --> 14:14.880]  Well, yeah, I think so I'm using it right now. And I you know, I'm like, world's number one laptop
[14:14.880 --> 14:21.280]  user kind of hate desktops. And I, I really like it. I mean, that was kind of my review, which is
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.920]  like, this could make me a desktop person. But there's too many things that I love about the
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.560]  flexibility of a laptop to really do this. So my ultimate thing was like, just give me this screen.
[14:30.560 --> 14:36.880]  And I buy that in a second from Apple. But back to the webcam, the webcam on it is amazing.
[14:36.880 --> 14:37.680]  Yeah, it really is.
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.880]  It's just so much better. And so that's one of the reasons I've kept it around back to the video
[14:42.880 --> 14:48.400]  calling thing. I still do video calls for important calls. And I do it for TV, too. This
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.360]  thing looks like I don't really have to set up the iPhone and this whole like system I had for for
[14:53.360 --> 15:00.480]  CNBC. I don't do that anymore. I've just been used iMac. So the camera here is really good. But again,
[15:00.480 --> 15:02.080]  the FaceTime is like FaceTime.
[15:02.800 --> 15:11.840]  All right. So let's do it. Let's do iMac first. The camera, to me, it was it was clearly
[15:11.840 --> 15:20.480]  it was like step one was with these M1 MacBooks last November. And it was it's literally I believe
[15:20.480 --> 15:26.320]  if you go to like iFixit, the camera is literally the same physical component as on the Intel
[15:26.320 --> 15:33.040]  MacBooks from before, which is a real piece of crap 720p with a tiny sensor that is terrible
[15:33.040 --> 15:40.160]  with light. And I believe you had that some comments on the old MacBook keyboards over
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.240]  the years. And with the M1, they have the same crappy camera, but piping it through the M1's
[15:46.240 --> 15:51.840]  image signal processing, they really cleaned it up and made it a lot more useful and famously,
[15:51.840 --> 15:58.240]  or at least famously between me and you. I used it to go on CNBC with you when the M1 MacBooks
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.000]  were new. And and it created a kerfuffle because people thought my my, my footage looked better
[16:04.000 --> 16:09.920]  than yours. But it's true. I'm still living that down. But but yeah,
[16:09.920 --> 16:16.320]  but it was improved. But it still wasn't great. That's the main thing. It's still it's like they
[16:16.320 --> 16:22.560]  cleaned up the noise and the color. And definitely we're doing something to realize that, hey,
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.040]  the only thing that really matters are people's faces in front of this thing. And and clearly
[16:27.040 --> 16:32.080]  their image signal processing was optimized for that. But it still was kind of muddy,
[16:32.080 --> 16:38.800]  right? In terms of, I mean, it's still really crappy. I mean, even in the comparisons I did
[16:38.800 --> 16:44.640]  of the 13 image MacBook Pro and this new iMac, it's like, yeah, it's like looking at a,
[16:45.840 --> 16:50.080]  like a blurry photo. Like, you know what it's like, remember when photos would you use like
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.320]  AOL and they would like take a while to load and they would be super blurry and then they'd come
[16:54.320 --> 17:00.160]  into focus? Yeah, yeah, progressive progressive JPEGs, right? Yes, exactly. That's it. That's
[17:00.160 --> 17:05.680]  what the webcams are like. Yeah, like this new iMac, everything is so clear. Like you can make
[17:05.680 --> 17:09.920]  out what's in the background, which is a bad thing for me because it means I have to clean my office.
[17:09.920 --> 17:15.760]  Like it's, it's substantially improved. And to your point, I didn't get to compare it. I don't
[17:15.760 --> 17:21.040]  know if you did. Well, it doesn't sound like you did, but they use the same camera hardware,
[17:21.040 --> 17:27.680]  the same 1080p module in this new 24 inch iMac than as they used in the 27 inch iMac from last
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.840]  year. No, I didn't know that. Yeah. And I mean, I didn't get to do side by sides, but I don't know,
[17:33.840 --> 17:40.320]  I just felt like this new 24 inch iMac is just one of the best webcams period that I've seen.
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.120]  Yeah, that was my question for you is how do you think it compares as somebody who's done much more
[17:45.120 --> 17:50.000]  comparisons on this stuff? So it's clearly the best built in camera Apple's ever shipped the
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.560]  combination of actually better 1080p camera hardware with the M1 image processing. Now
[17:56.560 --> 18:00.160]  you've got two things that are better, better hardware and better image processing. But how
[18:00.160 --> 18:09.520]  does it compare to like a the the standalone webcams that people have been desperately
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.520]  fighting in the black market for over the last year because they're all sold out?
[18:14.480 --> 18:21.200]  I mean, it compares pretty well to a Logitech, a Logitech 1080p webcam that I have, I would,
[18:21.200 --> 18:28.080]  I don't have one of the 4k ones, I not gone down that far. But and I don't even use the Logitech
[18:28.080 --> 18:34.800]  one usually when I set up I really like to use the I use the I use an iPhone a lot of times when
[18:34.800 --> 18:39.520]  I'm like doing an actual hit because I'm like, okay, I have the flexibility of the three lenses.
[18:39.520 --> 18:43.840]  I use that camo software, which is great and just hook it up. It's I mean, it's a little bit
[18:43.840 --> 18:50.960]  clunky, the whole experience, but it works. And definitely compared to any built in laptop that
[18:50.960 --> 18:56.080]  I've tested, it's way better. And that's, you know, has to do with Windows and Chromebooks. And
[18:56.080 --> 19:03.200]  I mean, definitely Macs. Yeah, yeah. What do you think about the chin on the iMac? Because that
[19:03.200 --> 19:09.840]  seems to be like I, I was skeptical. And I wrote in my review that I was anticipating that new
[19:09.840 --> 19:13.840]  iMacs would just get rid of this chin, because they wouldn't need it, they could just put the
[19:13.840 --> 19:20.320]  computer behind the display. I just didn't think they would try to make the whole thing so crazy
[19:20.320 --> 19:27.120]  thin. And then I, you know, it's like, Oh, well, now we have this chin. And it's, I don't know what
[19:27.120 --> 19:30.240]  that's gonna look like. And then once I had it set up, and I was in front of it, the chin just
[19:30.240 --> 19:37.680]  disappears. I honestly and some people complained, like, Oh, you know, it's, you're just saying that
[19:37.680 --> 19:41.120]  because you don't want to say bad things about Apple products. Like no, I love to say bad things
[19:41.120 --> 19:46.880]  about Apple products. I just I'm telling you that when I use the iMac, I the chin just disappears
[19:46.880 --> 19:54.080]  for me. And I don't notice it. I, it was like to your point, I was jarring at first when I took it
[19:54.080 --> 19:59.520]  out of the box. I was like, I did not notice this during the presentation. I'm just like, Ew, right?
[19:59.520 --> 20:04.160]  Like I was kind of like, Ew, I don't know why this is there. Over time, I think I was more upset. And
[20:04.160 --> 20:11.520]  I said this in the review. I like the colors of the back much better than this pastel color of the
[20:11.520 --> 20:17.840]  chin. Yeah. And that was like, I just don't I mean, maybe I don't like pastels. I think in my review,
[20:17.840 --> 20:24.080]  I called them sort of bridesmaid dress colors. That's so true. Like, and maybe from like the
[20:24.080 --> 20:31.520]  70s, like 70s, 1970s. And then like, I was telling you, like, the other thing is I have the blue one
[20:31.520 --> 20:38.320]  and like, it looks like I'm like at a baby boy's baby shower all the time. Like it's just blue and
[20:38.320 --> 20:46.080]  white and the white to me. I was more I know why they did the white bezel. I get it like walls are
[20:46.080 --> 20:53.440]  white and it blends in. But I'm just so used to like a sleek black frame around a really beautiful
[20:53.440 --> 20:59.680]  screen. So I look I'm fine with the chin. I definitely gave them you know, I wrote about that
[20:59.680 --> 21:04.000]  a little bit and mentioned it in the video. And actually in the video on that part because I was
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.600]  comparing it to the the G3 Mac and I pulled a quote from Steve Jobs when he was introducing the
[21:09.600 --> 21:15.040]  first one where he said the front of the or the back of this one looks better than the other guys,
[21:15.040 --> 21:19.840]  which the other guys were PCs at the time. But you know, in this context, I feel like the back
[21:19.840 --> 21:23.840]  of this iMac looks better than the front of it. Yeah, well, no, that was the quote is that job
[21:23.840 --> 21:28.400]  said that the back of the iMac looks better than the front of the other guys PCs, you know, that
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.080]  Oh, yeah, that's the exact quote. Yeah. You know what, that's a good point, though. And, and my
[21:34.080 --> 21:41.120]  wife had the same observation and that, that in her setup, if she were to buy one, and she would
[21:41.120 --> 21:46.560]  get the orange, she really likes it. And like I said, she has this orange desk, it would be perfect.
[21:47.120 --> 21:53.840]  But like she said, the best part of the orange is the back and in her setup, which I think is
[21:53.840 --> 21:59.200]  probably a, you know, the most common setup, it's, it's effectively against the wall. So you
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.120]  exactly kind of never see it. So I know, and Apple had all these demos of like, well, you could set
[22:05.120 --> 22:13.920]  it up as a retail kiosk, or like, you know, like, if you're checking in to a doctor's appointment,
[22:13.920 --> 22:20.480]  or salon or something, and the person that the check in has an iMac as their, their thing,
[22:20.480 --> 22:25.680]  then you, you, the customer see the back, right. And there are definitely places where you see the
[22:25.680 --> 22:33.520]  back of a display. But not in typical home scenarios, right. And there's also, there's
[22:33.520 --> 22:37.280]  the you're working in an office, like an open office space, and like, all the monitors are
[22:37.280 --> 22:41.440]  lined up. Right? Yeah, I mean, that same as me, like, I'm sitting against the, like, a wall in
[22:41.440 --> 22:47.360]  my office, and I'm staring at the baby boy, blue, baby shower, right. And let's just say, like,
[22:47.360 --> 22:53.440]  purple is your favorite color. And you're so excited, because now Apple, you know, after 20
[22:53.440 --> 22:58.880]  years has gone back and made like a really awesome purple, not like a little purple, but like,
[22:59.600 --> 23:07.360]  you know, Minnesota Vikings, capital P, purple iMac. And you set it up in your desk is putting
[23:07.360 --> 23:12.640]  it up against the wall. And you never get to see, you never get to see the purple, you get to see
[23:12.640 --> 23:17.520]  this sort of lavender that looks like a sweetheart or something. What's the deal with the purple,
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.480]  john? Like, what's come on? Like, they released this purple iPhone, and the world goes crazy.
[23:22.480 --> 23:28.240]  Am I missing something? All right, here's what I think. And I'm you're asking. I think as an
[23:28.240 --> 23:32.560]  observer, I'm right. But as somebody who could have picked the color, I would have been wrong,
[23:32.560 --> 23:40.640]  is that there's, there's like a trendiness in colors. And Apple has like a team who are like,
[23:40.640 --> 23:49.440]  a trend spotters who either are helping to define the colors of the year, or are have like their
[23:49.440 --> 23:55.120]  finger on the pulse of fashion and style and and trends and pick it out. But there is somebody and
[23:55.120 --> 23:58.000]  somebody told me this when they announced it when they announced that purple phone. They're like,
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.280]  this thing's gonna sell like crazy. And I'm like, it looks cool. But what do you mean? They're like,
[24:01.280 --> 24:05.840]  Oh, purple's the color of 2021. And I'm like, it is. And they're like, yeah, yeah.
[24:05.840 --> 24:10.800]  And this was the thing, like, I couldn't believe the coverage of it.
[24:10.800 --> 24:17.200]  Like, I just couldn't. And I was like, this is what's wrong with media. Yeah. So it's a color.
[24:17.200 --> 24:23.040]  So I got a haircut yesterday. And my stylist asked me, she knows what I do. You know,
[24:23.040 --> 24:26.160]  she's not a nerd. But she asked me about, you know, what are the what are the cool
[24:26.160 --> 24:29.920]  new features of the new iPhone? And I'm like, well, there's not really a new iPhone. She goes,
[24:29.920 --> 24:33.120]  Yeah, there is. And she couldn't believe I didn't know it. And she goes the purple one.
[24:33.120 --> 24:37.840]  And I'm like, well, but that's but that, you know, like, she knew about the purple one. She
[24:37.840 --> 24:43.680]  knew about the ads, the crazy ads for the purple one. Yeah. And she just assumed it meant it was
[24:43.680 --> 24:49.360]  new and had cool features and stuff. And she thought, and she even said, I think I'm getting
[24:49.360 --> 24:53.680]  that one. And I was amazing. Yeah. I mean, this is like the Apple marketing machine is just
[24:53.680 --> 24:58.960]  amazing when you think about it that way. Yeah. And they were all over the rose gold thing early
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.680]  a couple years ago. You know that? Oh, yeah. And now that rose gold is gone out.
[25:05.680 --> 25:10.160]  I wrote it into a script for my piece for next week, actually. And I was like, I'm not sure this
[25:10.160 --> 25:15.040]  is gonna land. Like, I'm not sure like people remember rose. I mean, they remember it. But like,
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.720]  it's not in the it was a thing. Well, and like, just like the gold iPhone was the first like a
[25:20.720 --> 25:28.880]  thing. And the other factor is that it's like t minus 543 until Samsung comes out with a purple
[25:28.880 --> 25:35.360]  phone. Yeah. It's true. Well, I've always been like fascinated by like the colors, because it
[25:35.360 --> 25:44.480]  seems like it's always a marketing thing. But like you said, very, very specific and carefully
[25:44.480 --> 25:50.960]  selected. And for people that are listening, we go to these briefings where truly they talk about
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.800]  the colors of the phone sometimes I'm not even just talking about Apple here, Samsung, other
[25:54.800 --> 26:03.360]  gadget makers, as if it was a science and the engineering and like the development of the color
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.720]  is as important as some other new feature. I remember very specifically, I don't go to lots
[26:10.720 --> 26:17.120]  of briefings for non Apple stuff. But I was at I was I went up to New York a couple of years ago,
[26:17.120 --> 26:23.840]  for a pixel thing with Google. And it was, I really enjoyed being there. It was I don't know
[26:23.840 --> 26:26.640]  if you were there. You must have been there because it was New York. Maybe we even had
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.600]  lunch afterwards. I don't know. But it was the one where they had the basketball hoop in inside.
[26:32.400 --> 26:36.320]  Do you remember that? I think I went to that. They had this weird loft space and they had a
[26:36.320 --> 26:43.520]  basketball hoop. And they wanted to it was like for something about testing one of their products
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.320]  for fitness or something. And I was like, hey, basketball is the only sport I'm any good at I
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.600]  can do and they're like, oh, you're too late. It was already it's over because somebody got hurt.
[26:53.600 --> 26:59.360]  And they stopped letting people shoot the hoops. And I was like, oh, come on. I was like, let me
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.760]  shoot a couple free throws. They're like, no, no, no, that's close. But they'd spent so much time
[27:03.760 --> 27:10.560]  talking about the color of the side button on the pixel phones. Right? Yeah. It was like talking
[27:10.560 --> 27:18.560]  about the specific shade of orange peach and and this like 500 words about it. And it's like, I do
[27:18.560 --> 27:24.000]  think it looks kind of cool. And it's an unique look to just have this like pop orange on a white
[27:24.000 --> 27:29.840]  and otherwise like white and black phone. But you know, it's just orange, right? Right. And then
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.560]  they've got things like oh, so orange and or I don't know if that's what that one was called.
[27:34.560 --> 27:42.400]  Yeah. Sage and but this is like, that's Google. But like Samsung's like, I don't want to say 10
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.840]  times worse, but worse. Like they they also will talk to you for a long time about the color
[27:47.840 --> 27:48.560]  options.
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.600]  All right, let me take a break and thank our first sponsor. Got it. Got it. Got to get going on the
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.000]  business aspect. Oh, I love the sponsor. This is great. They sponsored my website last week.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.480]  They're sponsoring the podcast now. It's it's a game called song pop party. It is the biggest
[28:08.480 --> 28:15.280]  music trivia game in the world. And it is now on Apple Arcade. It is in fact, the new song pop
[28:15.280 --> 28:22.240]  party is exclusive to Apple Arcade. Basically, it's a bit like name that tune where if you want
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.240]  to play against people, it starts playing a song and you have like a list of four options of like,
[28:28.240 --> 28:33.520]  Oh, who's the artist and the first person to tap the correct artist is the winner of that round.
[28:34.080 --> 28:40.400]  They have 10s of 1000s of songs and you have to guess as fast as you can. But it's the real
[28:40.400 --> 28:46.320]  songs. These aren't like samples or like covers like it's the real songs. They've got the rights
[28:46.320 --> 28:52.160]  to the legit hits. And they've got new stuff. I've played we played over the weekend because
[28:52.160 --> 28:57.120]  I like to test the sponsor stuff. I don't know any new music. I don't. The one I got
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.360]  what I got right was john legend and I didn't know the song. I just know his voice and I
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.840]  but I'm really bad with that. But if you get me going on the 80s, I can I can compete pretty well.
[29:07.840 --> 29:13.120]  So they've got like a library that really, really works depending on whether you want new music or
[29:13.120 --> 29:18.160]  you want to go to the 70s or the 80s or the 90s or something like that. They've got all I mean,
[29:18.160 --> 29:22.560]  literally 10s of 1000s of songs. They've got all the genres who you want rock, hip hop, country,
[29:22.560 --> 29:31.040]  80s, everything you want. You can play solo, or arena mode against strangers online randos,
[29:31.040 --> 29:36.880]  or it the best mode, the one where it really shines is in party mode, you can play up to eight
[29:36.880 --> 29:44.160]  people in the same room. For example, and because it's an Apple arcade game, Mac, iPhone, iPad,
[29:44.160 --> 29:51.840]  and Apple TV. And this is where like Apple TV is a game thing is really awesome. And you can even
[29:51.840 --> 29:58.240]  play with the Siri remote, including the new one. The old one, I guess works, but we I don't know,
[29:58.240 --> 30:04.160]  I think everybody threw their old Siri remotes in the garbage. Anyway, every platform. It is native
[30:04.160 --> 30:10.000]  on the M one on the Mac. It also works on the old Intel Macs, your Apple TV, everything syncs
[30:10.000 --> 30:15.280]  automatically. So you can take a game from one Apple device to another. And because it's on Apple
[30:15.280 --> 30:23.520]  arcade, there are no ads, no in app purchases, never asks for an email never asks you to sign in,
[30:23.520 --> 30:31.600]  never tracks anything. There's no data collection at all. Apple. Let's and I maybe they even demand
[30:31.600 --> 30:38.160]  it. But Apple lets game developers for Apple arcade, gather zero metrics and data about you.
[30:38.160 --> 30:42.720]  It's privacy first. I don't even have a URL to tell you because it's an Apple arcade exclusive.
[30:42.720 --> 30:47.920]  If you already have Apple arcade or you subscribe to Apple one, you can just go to the app store
[30:47.920 --> 30:54.080]  and download sound song pop party. And if you don't, you could if you really want to try it,
[30:54.080 --> 30:59.680]  you could sign up for a demo of Apple arcade or Apple one and get it there. But if you do have
[30:59.680 --> 31:04.320]  Apple arcade access already, it's a no brainer to try this. If you have any interest in a fun party
[31:04.320 --> 31:08.800]  game, it's a lot of fun and really well done the Paul, you know, it's polished and looks great and
[31:08.800 --> 31:17.120]  everything like that. So my thanks to song pop party get it on Apple arcade. What I love that
[31:17.120 --> 31:21.920]  that's the name of the app and they you have to say it so many times song pop party. It's a good
[31:21.920 --> 31:30.400]  name. Good job. He did a good job. It's a good name. What else about the iMac? I what do you
[31:30.400 --> 31:36.640]  think of the keyboard? I like the keyboard. I mean, I love the fingerprint sensor. It's loud.
[31:36.640 --> 31:44.800]  You know, it's one thing I realized is like, I can talk. Well, I can type quieter on my MacBook Pro
[31:44.800 --> 31:51.680]  keyboard now than I can on. What is this the magic keyboard? Extern? They're both called magic
[31:51.680 --> 31:57.040]  keyboards. I don't know. Branding thing at this point. Everything's a magic keyboard. It's a magic
[31:57.040 --> 32:01.920]  keyboard about it. Yeah. That's my biggest complaint. I love the like feedback. And I've
[32:01.920 --> 32:08.400]  actually like really, I I've now gotten used to the desktop setup. So the fact that I have the,
[32:08.400 --> 32:14.000]  I've been using the trackpad, the magic trackpad and the keyboard and I like it, you know, I miss
[32:14.000 --> 32:21.040]  a lot about my laptop setup, but I like it. It's just loud. They did give us the I assume every
[32:21.040 --> 32:26.560]  reviewer got the same kit. They gave us both the mouse and the trackpad. And it's funny because
[32:26.560 --> 32:37.600]  I've gone laptop only over the last few years to for various reasons. And I used to be a diehard
[32:37.600 --> 32:44.400]  mouse person on the on the desktop, if I had a desktop setup. And I have to say that it's like,
[32:44.400 --> 32:48.880]  I finally have been laptop only long enough where a mouse feels a little weird to me.
[32:48.880 --> 32:56.960]  I agree. I did go through this thing a couple of weeks ago where I tried to, well, I didn't try I
[32:56.960 --> 33:03.920]  need to convert myself from just sitting at laptop and with a big monitor to a more of a desktop
[33:03.920 --> 33:08.480]  setting because it's just really bad for my back. And I feel like ergonomically it's been bad for
[33:08.480 --> 33:13.680]  me because I've been sitting at this desk for so long. So I already was trying to move to a
[33:13.680 --> 33:21.440]  a keyboard accessory and external mouse. And I don't know I was using a Logitech mouse. So I like,
[33:22.160 --> 33:26.560]  like, I mean, there's a lot of things about the magic mouse that I just don't like. But there are
[33:26.560 --> 33:31.440]  certain times I'm like, this just feels nice to push this mouse around. Yeah, it is. It's a very
[33:31.440 --> 33:36.640]  opinionated mouse. And I know everybody loves to complain about the lightning hole on the bottom.
[33:36.640 --> 33:45.600]  And I did. I did. I really made a thing about it. It is goofy. I know. I know it is. But my my
[33:45.600 --> 33:51.280]  defense of it is you can't make a mouse the shape that it is with an exposed lightning port, you'd
[33:51.280 --> 33:56.880]  have to make an all new mouse now. They could make maybe that's the answer. They should make a whole
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.280]  new mouse in a different shape. They should make a whole new mouse like like, for example, as we'll
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.640]  get to, you know, in a bit that they they did a little bit more than just tweak the Apple TV
[34:06.640 --> 34:14.480]  remote, they made an all new remote. But that's if somebody at Apple really thinks this shape and
[34:14.480 --> 34:20.160]  fundamental design where the clickable area goes all the way down to the tabletop, there's no room
[34:20.160 --> 34:26.080]  for a lightning thing. And I also subsequently think that they really don't want I don't know
[34:26.080 --> 34:30.880]  why I don't think they want people using the mouse plugged in for some reason. And it doesn't
[34:30.880 --> 34:36.000]  take long. I it is weird, though. And yeah, I agree with you, they don't want you using the
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.720]  mouse plugged in. And I complained about it. And I, you know, made some jokes about it in the video.
[34:40.720 --> 34:48.160]  I think for me, it's just I, the net, the mouse is so narrow and flat that for me, I just, I like
[34:48.160 --> 34:56.240]  the how do I say this in a way that doesn't sound bad. The I want to use the word girth, but I don't
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.600]  want to put this in the sentence because I think it's just going to come out really bad.
[35:01.600 --> 35:08.640]  It it demands a certain mouse grip. Right? Yes. Yeah. Yes. And that feels good. Like
[35:08.640 --> 35:13.040]  when you have a mouse that is like you are actually holding this thing is so flat.
[35:13.840 --> 35:20.480]  Yeah. And so my son is, you know, is into gaming PCs and has a couple of mice now,
[35:20.480 --> 35:28.480]  I guess a couple of them from razor. And the razor ones are the gaming mice seem to be more
[35:28.480 --> 35:34.400]  like how I traditionally grip a mouse. And I still giant. Yeah, they're well, they're not
[35:34.400 --> 35:42.800]  giant giant. Like I feel like there was a time like when there was like a long time when when
[35:42.800 --> 35:48.880]  the debate was, hey, Apple mice only have one button and PC mice have two buttons and a scroll
[35:48.880 --> 35:54.800]  wheel. And that's better. And it's better to just get one of the PC mice and plug it in your Mac,
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.720]  because the Mac will recognize you and blah, blah, blah, two buttons versus one button. And then all
[35:58.720 --> 36:05.840]  of a sudden, the world went to like 10 button mice for power users and gamers. And they got enormous,
[36:05.840 --> 36:10.880]  you know, it's like, and that's what I'm asking. Because I remember when I was doing laptop PCs
[36:10.880 --> 36:16.080]  and desktop PCs reviews, I would get all these accessories and the mice were huge. And they had
[36:16.080 --> 36:20.560]  all these button programmable buttons. And you know, also, they were also awesome, because they
[36:20.560 --> 36:25.360]  would like turn different colors and stuff. But I never could remember which one to use. And they
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.360]  were huge. They would just like take up half the desk, like the half the mouse pad was the mouse.
[36:29.360 --> 36:34.240]  Yeah, but you know, and Jonas is only, you know, you got I'm gonna say only and you're gonna go,
[36:34.240 --> 36:40.240]  I can't believe he's that old, but he's only 17. So he's still his, his mind is still fluid. And
[36:40.240 --> 36:47.600]  he's, he's easily adaptable to to new things. But even he thought when I had him try the iMac, he
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.560]  thought that the that the Apple mouse, it just is not compatible with the way he wants to grip a
[36:52.560 --> 36:58.320]  mouse. And every time he tried to use it, it, it's like, this is just so weird to grip. And it's
[36:58.320 --> 37:02.080]  clicking when he doesn't want to click and stuff like that. But I know some people love it. I don't
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.680]  know, I've gotten full trackpad, though. And the other thing for me is that for me, a mouse is
[37:07.680 --> 37:13.600]  always better if you have to drag long distances, right? Like the trackpad, the downside to the
[37:13.600 --> 37:20.240]  trackpad lifestyle is if you want to drag like a file in the finder, from the upper, upper left
[37:20.240 --> 37:25.120]  all the way to the trash can in the bottom right, and it's like, I've run out of space on the trackpad
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.400]  What do I do? It's like it never happens with the mouse. And when I was doing graphic design work,
[37:30.400 --> 37:36.640]  either full time or, you know, large part of my my daily life, years ago, I would have never,
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.040]  ever wanted to use a trackpad. I'd want a mouse because it's like you're dragging things corner
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.560]  to corner all the time and with more, more precision, but for what I'm doing, writing,
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.560]  and just clicking between tabs. It's like my mind just goes to a trackpad.
[37:51.360 --> 37:56.400]  Yeah, same. It's funny, I went to go interview a guy a couple months ago, he was, I did this piece
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.640]  on vaccines. And anyway, ended up in this guy's house, he was booking all of these vaccines for
[38:00.640 --> 38:07.200]  elderly people. And he had two IMAX and he had, I think it was probably like, I want to say like,
[38:07.200 --> 38:13.120]  three or four magic mice on his desk. And I asked him, I was like, what's going on? Like,
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.360]  why do you need these? He's like, I mean, this guy's a programmer engineer, he just was always
[38:17.360 --> 38:22.320]  at his desk. And he's like, well, when one dies, I just swap the batteries, or I'm charging and I
[38:22.320 --> 38:30.880]  have another one. And I was like, Oh, okay. And yeah, he had like, I mean, he was a big sort of,
[38:30.880 --> 38:34.800]  he was very organized, very organized about everything you did. And I mean, did amazing
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.960]  things. I think he ended up booking a couple thousand appointments for people getting vaccines
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.720]  sort of amazing. I do think and I said this on my show last week with Marco Arment, like, I don't
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.400]  want to throw Johnny Ive under the bus, but they're and you never know, because Apple doesn't
[38:50.400 --> 38:57.280]  explain who decided what it's always Apple did this, but it does seem post Johnny Ive,
[38:57.280 --> 39:04.560]  and if you figure that they're on, you know, 12 to 18 month, look ahead cycles for everything
[39:04.560 --> 39:11.440]  they're building. It just seems though, that now that Johnny Ive has been out of Apple,
[39:11.440 --> 39:18.080]  for a few years, we're starting to see maybe some of the things that he was hung up on.
[39:18.080 --> 39:26.640]  And now that I'm going to say like the Apple TV remote is a Johnny Ive ism. And now they've gone
[39:26.640 --> 39:33.600]  back. So it was on my mind when they you know, when it was clear that they were doing new IMAX,
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.280]  like, I wonder if they're going to redo the mouse is this mouse shape a Johnny Ive thing where he's
[39:39.280 --> 39:44.480]  like, you know, you don't have to charge it. It's so light and airy. And you know, it's it just,
[39:44.480 --> 39:53.040]  you know, this top surface forms, you know, molds into the tabletop. It was that, or, you know,
[39:53.680 --> 39:57.200]  this would have been an opportunity for a new mouse shape. And nope.
[39:57.200 --> 40:01.360]  Well, yeah, and I would say the same of the keyboard, though, like, you know, for when you
[40:01.360 --> 40:07.680]  look at the keyboards, like, okay, they lifted the touch ID from the iPhone, what, eight, and just
[40:07.680 --> 40:12.720]  put it in the corner. And then they changed the color. So they did some changes here.
[40:12.720 --> 40:16.720]  The keyboards definitely knew the mouse is just a new color of aluminum, right?
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.080]  But they did some, you know, they they did change these things. I mean, yeah, obviously, it's not a
[40:22.080 --> 40:27.200]  full, just the color swap back to our conversation about colors. And I like that their colors match.
[40:27.200 --> 40:33.200]  And it's a really nice touch. I'm used to as somebody who's had been using a touch ID
[40:33.200 --> 40:43.120]  MacBook Pro, I guess since they came out, I'm used to touch ID on the Mac keyboard. And so it, it
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.800]  didn't feel weird or unusual to me to use the iMac keyboard and just go to the top right corner of
[40:48.800 --> 40:53.680]  the keyboard with my index finger to do all the touch ID stuff. But I was actually even just
[40:53.680 --> 40:59.760]  before we recorded this today, I was chatting with some people on Twitter about, well, why not face
[40:59.760 --> 41:08.480]  ID? Why touch ID instead of face ID on the Mac? And I answer? Well, I don't know. Nobody, you know,
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.240]  again, Apple doesn't explain stuff like that. I mean, one thing I could think of before was the
[41:14.240 --> 41:20.720]  aesthetics of it, right? Like, they're not going to put a notch in the Mac. Like it just, it just
[41:20.720 --> 41:24.960]  wouldn't work. I mean, it would be whatever you think of the notch on the phone, I don't think it
[41:24.960 --> 41:28.640]  would look good on the Mac. So it would have to go in the bezel. But if they wanted to have this
[41:28.640 --> 41:34.800]  white bezel, then it would be like, not just a little tiny hole punch in the middle for the one
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.440]  camera. It's like you'd have this whole oval up there. I guess though, then they could, you know,
[41:39.440 --> 41:42.880]  you could say, well, then don't make it a white bezel, make it a black bezel, then you could hide
[41:42.880 --> 41:51.440]  it in there. I think, though, that there's a security, a scam aspect to it. Obviously,
[41:51.440 --> 41:58.560]  there's a security aspect to all of these biometrics. But I think that there's a scam angle
[41:59.120 --> 42:06.160]  to it, where it's like Apple doesn't talk about stuff like this, because it's unpleasant. But I
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.800]  do think that there was this whole like, by the tail end of touch ID phones, there was a sort of
[42:12.800 --> 42:18.480]  cottage industry of scam apps in the App Store that would have in app purchases that would come
[42:18.480 --> 42:25.120]  up at unexpected times. And I've heard the story from a bunch of people. And I've read, you know,
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.240]  there have been reports of it. And people are like, they don't know what it is, they didn't
[42:28.240 --> 42:36.480]  expect it, they don't want it. And in app purchase, and years of iPhone use train them,
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.520]  if you ever get in caught in a situation where you don't know what's going or the app seems locked up
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.240]  or whatever, hit the home button, and you'll get it's an escape hatch to go back to the home
[42:46.240 --> 42:53.360]  screen. Well, if you're if you're facing a in app purchase prompt, and you hit the home button with
[42:53.360 --> 43:01.120]  your thumb, it it's like catching. And I know that I don't think it was a I don't know how big a
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.960]  problem it was, right? I don't know how many people got scammed that way. But definitely
[43:04.960 --> 43:12.560]  people got scammed. And there. I've never verified it with anybody even off the record, but I'm
[43:12.560 --> 43:22.160]  nearly certain from hints that I've gotten that they recognize that the confirmation of a payment
[43:22.160 --> 43:31.040]  with a face ID iPhone is a little bit more onerous than touch ID was right. So if it's an honest app,
[43:31.040 --> 43:37.200]  and I think you really want to buy just putting your thumb on that sensor was is was so easy. Now,
[43:37.200 --> 43:41.040]  you have to hold the phone and the face ID part is pretty easy if you're looking at it,
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.440]  but you've got to do this sort of sort of weird double click of the side button, right? The side
[43:45.440 --> 43:51.360]  button. Yeah, confirmation, but the side button click cannot be faked by software. There's no
[43:51.360 --> 43:58.160]  access that there's no way there is no API that an app can use to simulate a fake side button press,
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.120]  right? It needs the hardware verification, right? And and making it a double press means that
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.440]  somebody who's like, I don't know what this is, I just want to turn my phone off and clicks at once.
[44:07.440 --> 44:14.720]  It's not going to happen. So it and I think I think that's the problem with face ID on the Mac
[44:14.720 --> 44:20.880]  is that there would still need like for unlocking your Mac, like just sitting down in front of it,
[44:20.880 --> 44:26.480]  and you hit the spacebar, it would be or click anything or just, you know, wave in front of it
[44:26.480 --> 44:30.960]  or whatever face ID would be fantastic. It would just unlock your Mac and authenticate you and say,
[44:30.960 --> 44:37.280]  Okay, I recognize you, Joanna, you're in, you're unlocked. But for purchases, you would need some
[44:37.280 --> 44:46.640]  kind of secondary confirmation. And what on the Mac, what would that be? That can't be faked by
[44:46.640 --> 44:53.040]  a malicious app. So if it's just like a regular keyboard key, like Oh, press return, well, apps
[44:53.040 --> 45:00.080]  can can simulate a return key on the Mac. You need you need to have like a special key on the keyboard,
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.200]  like that can't be simulated by software. Well, once you're talking about that, you're talking
[45:05.200 --> 45:09.360]  about the touch ID button that they have now. That is the special key. So why even have face
[45:09.360 --> 45:14.320]  ID if you need a specialized button anyway, and anything on screen, if it was like an on screen
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.520]  button that you had to click that says confirm that you'd like to purchase this. I think that
[45:19.520 --> 45:26.080]  there's just ways that apps can can fake that right that they can like just fake the button press
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.960]  or put something up over it and you think you're clicking this thing that's over it, but it's
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.920]  actually the click is going through to the authentic. I think it's about scams. But I don't
[45:35.920 --> 45:40.320]  know. It's really first of all, I never really thought about any of this scam stuff. So now I've
[45:40.320 --> 45:44.800]  written this down as a story idea for one day. It's crazy. I never really thought about it, but it
[45:44.800 --> 45:50.160]  makes total sense. Yeah. Like lots of people must be dealing with this stuff. Yeah, you should look
[45:50.160 --> 45:54.880]  into it. But what you bring up is interesting, too, because I, I did some reporting earlier in
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.720]  the year, because I was looking at the new Samsung Galaxy S21. And I was just thinking when I
[46:00.720 --> 46:05.200]  got that I was like, well, you know, there's a lot of multi factor authentication. And I think I'm
[46:05.200 --> 46:11.120]  not sure if we talked about this on your podcast, but the the in fingerprint sensor in the screen
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.920]  has gotten really good. And it got me wondering, like, well, what's Apple thinking about with
[46:15.920 --> 46:23.280]  multi with multi factor bio authentication? And I did some reporting, and it seems like Apple's
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.440]  very interested in that. I mean, it seems like they definitely had teams and I had one source
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.520]  started telling me they've been playing around with this for a number of years. And there was
[46:31.520 --> 46:39.600]  this interest to seem to bring back the fingerprint sensor in. They have a lot of patents around the
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.160]  in screen fingerprint sensor. But the question that I had was like, well, is that just to get
[46:44.160 --> 46:48.640]  rid of the other, you know, you have an iPhone SE and people love that thing, that sort of home
[46:48.640 --> 46:54.240]  button? Or is it to combine both of them? Would they want to have a phone and any other device
[46:54.240 --> 47:01.040]  where you'd have two, two ideas, two choices, or use them in tandem? Yeah. And even what you're
[47:01.040 --> 47:05.040]  talking about here makes a lot of sense, right? Because they've had to have the verification be
[47:05.040 --> 47:12.560]  in another hardware factor on the device. Yeah. I think they must be working in that regard. And
[47:12.560 --> 47:18.800]  my argument and favorite that they must be is that just think about the way we as human beings
[47:18.800 --> 47:23.600]  recognize each other, right? Like I all I've got right now, because, again, we're on Skype,
[47:23.600 --> 47:28.800]  all I've got is your voice, but I do know your voice. And I know it's you. But I'd be a lot more
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.160]  certain it were you if we were face to face recording in person, right? And I could see you,
[47:34.160 --> 47:41.760]  right? We use multiple senses, you know, it's, it's how you know where you are, you know, like,
[47:41.760 --> 47:47.280]  you know, sometimes you can go to, like, if I go to my parents' home, I could recognize it by smell,
[47:47.280 --> 47:54.080]  right? There's just like, I'm in my parents' house, you know, it can't be faked. So it, I feel
[47:54.080 --> 48:00.640]  like that's inevitable. But I feel like it's, it's working out those user experience flows of, well,
[48:00.640 --> 48:06.480]  when do you use what? Sure, you could just unlock the phone with your face. But then what do you do
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.520]  for a purchase? And that might be the answer for the Mac, maybe the answer for the Mac is they will
[48:11.520 --> 48:17.840]  add face ID, and it will just unlock your Mac by face ID, but they will also have a touch ID button
[48:17.840 --> 48:22.720]  on the keyboard. And if you want to make a purchase, you've got to use the touch ID button.
[48:23.840 --> 48:27.920]  Right. And it seems like the obvious place to to like really play with this is on the
[48:29.360 --> 48:32.480]  well on the iPad, really. Yeah.
[48:33.520 --> 48:36.800]  All right. Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor. It's it's our good
[48:36.800 --> 48:43.760]  friends, new sponsor, LinkedIn Jobs. Growing your business takes more than offering a popular

[49:01.600 --> 49:07.040]  experience finding a job with LinkedIn Jobs, but I didn't find my job here at Daring Firewall.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.720]  I made it. So I don't have any personal experience. And as we mentioned, by coincidence,
[49:12.720 --> 49:17.200]  I don't have any employees either. But if I did, I would certainly be willing to look at LinkedIn
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.440]  Jobs. And he'd love to video chat. Yeah. So I would like to video chat to interview every single
[49:23.440 --> 49:31.840]  one of them. You can get started by posting your job for free to reach reach LinkedIn's network of
[49:31.840 --> 49:40.320]  get this 740 million professionals that is not a mistake on my part 740 million professionals

[50:18.160 --> 50:23.520]  and conditions do apply. I a lot of people are looking for work, a lot of people are changing
[50:23.520 --> 50:30.240]  changing up what they're doing post post post COVID. I have to say I spend actually a good
[50:30.240 --> 50:36.560]  amount of time on LinkedIn these days. Not looking for a job, please editors. I'm not looking for a
[50:36.560 --> 50:46.400]  job there. But I get very smart reader and viewer email or friend requests like messages there.
[50:46.400 --> 50:54.080]  Far more sophisticated and clear than I would get on Twitter or Facebook or one of those places,
[50:54.080 --> 50:58.720]  or even email. Yeah, I have to say I put off signing up for LinkedIn until a few years ago,
[50:58.720 --> 51:04.080]  but I did and I don't use a lot but when I do it is all it's it's sort of like this weird alternate
[51:04.080 --> 51:13.120]  universe where social media is completely sane and calm and like a lot more like the real world.
[51:13.120 --> 51:18.160]  lot more like the real world. So I got a package for somebody down the street by accident, they
[51:18.160 --> 51:21.840]  just dropped it off. Or maybe they it was small, I forget. I think it might have even gone through
[51:21.840 --> 51:26.880]  the mail slot. But I was like, I don't know who this is. But I see the address. And I was like,
[51:26.880 --> 51:31.360]  I wonder how I can get in touch with them. And I like Google the person. And their only hit on
[51:31.360 --> 51:36.000]  social media was LinkedIn. I was like, Oh, I have LinkedIn. And I like LinkedIn. And I opened a chat.
[51:36.000 --> 51:41.360]  And he was like, Oh, I use that, you know, that's me. I don't even know what that is. But I'll come
[51:41.360 --> 51:44.960]  pick it up. And I was just like, and he's like, Where are you? And I'm like, I gave him my address.
[51:44.960 --> 51:50.160]  And he's like, Oh, you're right down the street. And it was all it was delightful. And now I now
[51:50.160 --> 51:55.520]  I have a neighborhood friend. That's a beautiful story, a LinkedIn friend, a LinkedIn friend,
[51:55.520 --> 51:58.400]  something bad could have happened to that meetup. But I don't want to go down there.
[51:59.840 --> 52:06.160]  He seemed legit. He actually works at Microsoft. Of course he does. Of course he does. Let's talk
[52:06.160 --> 52:10.960]  iPad. So here's, here's my biggest complaint about the iPad. And I kind of regret not putting
[52:10.960 --> 52:16.800]  in my iPad Pro review. And I don't know what the answer is. But my biggest problem with the new
[52:16.800 --> 52:24.560]  iPad Pro is, okay, they've done all of this work to make it work as in a laptop form factor. And
[52:24.560 --> 52:31.120]  they have this nice new keyboard cover that came out last year. And it works pretty great. And I
[52:31.120 --> 52:36.640]  think for people who really like the iPad, they love it. But once you've got the iPad in the Magic
[52:36.640 --> 52:44.640]  Keyboard cover, the camera is off to the left, and it's down low, right. And so even on like a
[52:44.640 --> 52:52.400]  regular laptop, the camera is usually too low to be flattering. If it's that your laptop is at a
[52:52.400 --> 52:59.200]  comfortable desk height, and you're taller than the top of the laptop. But with the iPad Pro,
[52:59.200 --> 53:05.680]  it's even lower. And it always makes it look like you're not paying attention to the person
[53:05.680 --> 53:09.840]  you're video chatting with. Because it looks like you're looking off to the side.
[53:10.880 --> 53:14.240]  I mean, most of the time, I'm probably not paying attention, but I totally agree.
[53:15.040 --> 53:20.960]  But this is and I will say I didn't review the iPad Pro. Nicole Nguyen, my colleague did,
[53:20.960 --> 53:25.120]  and she highlighted a lot of this, but she also talked about how good center stage is. So what
[53:25.120 --> 53:31.440]  did you think about that? I thought it was great. I thought it was truly uncanny. And every bit as
[53:31.440 --> 53:37.680]  the demo that Apple showed during the event was a genuinely honest demo of how it works in terms of
[53:38.320 --> 53:45.200]  the fluidity of the panning and the zooming in and out of people jumping in. And it was it was
[53:45.200 --> 53:52.160]  a great excuse to get to get my 17 year old who is a delightful young man, but is maybe not the
[53:52.160 --> 53:57.120]  most enthusiastic about talking to grandparents on FaceTime, because he's 17 and would rather be
[53:57.120 --> 54:02.800]  playing video games. But it was a great excuse to fire up FaceTime and talk to family and get him in
[54:02.800 --> 54:08.000]  and, you know, have him walk in and out of frame and have the zooming in and out. It works great,
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.880]  but it's just such a weird angle. And when it's in the state, you know, the keyboard it. Yeah,
[54:14.880 --> 54:19.600]  you really want that camera at the top. And I get it because then when you're holding the iPad
[54:20.320 --> 54:26.080]  up and down, then your your hand might be covering it and then it would be on the side and you can't
[54:26.080 --> 54:32.400]  it's just a weird thing like having a device too. Yeah, but then all this, you know, is two cameras
[54:32.400 --> 54:37.760]  the right answer? It seems that then I think they should just move it really. I mean, on especially
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.320]  on these pros, which it would be I've always I think I said this in a couple of iPad reviews
[54:42.320 --> 54:47.040]  previously, like I'd love to see data about how many people are holding it. Like when you have
[54:47.040 --> 54:52.480]  the pro if you're really just using a lot of it vertically, horizontally. Yeah. Because the
[54:52.480 --> 54:58.000]  keyboard if you're buying the keyboard with it means like, I have an iPad Pro here from two last
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.080]  year, I guess with the keyboard dock, and it's always horizontal. Right? Like it's just that's
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.000]  the way I type on it. It's even how I watch on like it's just that's the traditional way.
[55:11.680 --> 55:17.200]  Why not have the camera on at least on the pros in that location, I can see on the air and the
[55:17.200 --> 55:22.960]  regular iPad, keeping it vertical, because a lot of that use case may still be vertical. Did you
[55:22.960 --> 55:30.320]  notice that recently, I think in either iPad OS 14.5, or I think it was 14.5. But it was pretty
[55:30.320 --> 55:36.720]  recent. They've, they've updated it so that when you power it on or restart it, the Apple logo is
[55:36.720 --> 55:42.880]  actually oriented whichever way the iPad is, as opposed to up until now, it was always the Apple
[55:42.880 --> 55:48.240]  the Apple logo on on the boot was always oriented as though you were holding it up and down.
[55:48.240 --> 55:53.520]  And so vertical, yeah, vertical. And so if you had it horizontal in the keyboard, every time you
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.360]  installed a software update, or otherwise restarted at the Apple logo was sideways.
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.160]  And I was like, well, they have to pick one, you know, this is like the camera, they have to pick
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.920]  one, I guess they, you know, up and down vertical is the default that that's the official iPad
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.440]  orientation. And so they had to do it. And how are they ever going to make the Apple logo adjust
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.520]  dynamically? Because it hasn't booted yet. So how does it even and somehow they fixed it? I don't
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.640]  know how they did it. But I love the idea that someone at Apple was so bothered by it that they
[56:22.640 --> 56:29.360]  they committed engineering resources to let's get this Apple logo to go both ways. I love that.
[56:30.160 --> 56:36.320]  But they also I don't when was it that they made the tweak where the what's the sidebar called?
[56:36.320 --> 56:41.840]  I think it must have been iOS 13. Like around, I think when they forked iOS, iPad OS,
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.320]  right, where they really started to make the case of, hey, this interface is going to feel different
[56:46.320 --> 56:51.280]  in horizontal mode. Yeah, it just feels like there was this shift where they really were addressing,
[56:51.280 --> 56:58.320]  okay, we're really going to embrace the keyboard, the hard the horizontal setup. And
[56:59.840 --> 57:02.240]  it feels like the camera's just leftover.
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.520]  Yeah, I don't know what they can do, right? If they could move it to the side, I kind of feel
[57:07.520 --> 57:13.040]  like you do like if they're gonna say that the for the pros, it you've got this keyboard, maybe
[57:13.040 --> 57:18.080]  just put the camera on the side. And it's like I had the idea. Well, what if they put it in the
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.000]  corner? And then when you say the side, you mean on the, so it would be at the top when it's in the
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.720]  in the keyboard in horizontal? Yeah. But see, I view that as the top. So it's like, okay,
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.680]  let's see, I view that as the top. Yeah. Because like for these iPad pros, it's that's the top to
[57:35.680 --> 57:42.080]  me. Like I very rarely I'm using that holding and as in vertical. Like even when I take it out of
[57:42.080 --> 57:47.120]  the keyboard, and I'm like in bed scrolling and looking, it's still horizontal. Like I'm really
[57:47.120 --> 57:54.000]  never using it like iPhone style. Yeah. I don't read a lot. I don't I don't know how to read.
[57:54.000 --> 58:01.680]  I don't read a lot on the iPad. So maybe that's the difference. Like a lot of people who read
[58:01.680 --> 58:07.120]  and use this as like a as an e reader still, like that's the default, right? Like as a book.
[58:07.120 --> 58:16.240]  Yeah, no, definitely. Amy loves her iPad Pro. And she likes the big one. She has the the I wish it
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.080]  was 13 inches, the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. And she uses it all the time. She always uses it in
[58:22.080 --> 58:28.640]  vertical mode, though. So interesting. And she doesn't even have to do on it. She just likes to
[58:28.640 --> 58:34.720]  read and play games and just text and she sits there and text with one finger on the thing,
[58:34.720 --> 58:40.320]  but she just reads it. She just loves it for reading and reading the web and just doing it in a
[58:40.320 --> 58:46.160]  you know, she's it's exactly like Steve Jobs predicted when it came out that she likes to sit
[58:46.160 --> 58:50.960]  back, right? She's on the couch. And instead of sitting forward in a desk chair doing her reading,
[58:50.960 --> 58:56.800]  she likes to sit in a comfortable chair and lean back and read all of her news and email and stuff
[58:56.800 --> 59:02.480]  there. Yeah, I don't I don't. And I was actually thinking about that a lot in the case of this
[59:02.480 --> 59:12.560]  iMac. Because maybe I could be an iMac iPad person. But I'm really a MacBook iPhone person.
[59:13.840 --> 59:19.360]  And that is to say, like when I'm at my desk, yeah, I use a laptop with a with a screen,
[59:19.360 --> 59:25.040]  but then I want to leave my desk, but I still go to my laptop. So like, at night,
[59:25.040 --> 59:30.800]  if I have to send a quick email, I grab my laptop, or I'm on my iPhone. Yeah. I was sort of thinking,
[59:30.800 --> 59:36.080]  okay, well, if I move to an iMac, because I'm home a lot more, and I like this screen here, well,
[59:37.360 --> 59:41.200]  then I might use an iPad on the couch. Maybe I go use my iPad Pro.
[59:42.480 --> 59:49.120]  I do this thing where I find that with the iPad Pro, it's a it's a time sink for me. And it's not
[59:49.120 --> 59:54.000]  it's not a complaint per se. It's just that when I'm at my most productive, it's when I'm at my Mac,
[59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.600]  by far, 100%. And so like in the morning, I wake up and I'm making coffee and I'm in the kitchen
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:05.840]  and I have my I should what I should do is get my iPad out of the kitchen, but I keep it in the
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:13.200]  kitchen. And if I sit down and start using my iPad, I'll find like, two hours have gone by.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:20.000]  And I've, I've worked and I've read stuff, but for the most part, I don't like doing my actual blog
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  posting from iPad. And so all I've really done is flag a bunch of articles that I want to link to
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.520]  or write about or something, but I haven't actually done it. Whereas if I had just been
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:35.520]  sitting at my Mac, I'd have already posted two or three things. And if I instead just force myself
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:42.160]  to just use even though my iPads right there, use my phone instead, I will, while I'm making coffee
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.280]  and maybe having the first sips of it, I will think I should go downstairs to my office and
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:53.920]  get to work. And it's just it's not a complaint per se, it's just that, but I'll get sucked into
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.960]  the iPad. And it's just good enough to keep me there. But I don't feel productive enough to
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.920]  actually do the full work. I'm sitting there like flagging emails like, oh, when I get to my Mac,
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.960]  I'll actually answer this email because I want to find a file and Dropbox and drag it in and
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.320]  do this other thing or and it's like I don't want to do that on the iPad. So I'll just flag emails
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:21.680]  and it's like it's it's sort of like the way that some people can get sucked into a to do system.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.920]  And you're not actually getting anything done. All you're doing is organizing your to do's
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.880]  exquisitely with tags and projects and and you feel like you've accomplished something,
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.720]  but you haven't actually done any of it. All you've done is organized this exquisite to do
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:40.880]  system. I'm the same way on like, on the Mac, I just feel like, oh, I can get this done. And I'm
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.640]  still the same type of person where I'm like, you know what, this is an email I really need to think
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.440]  about. I'm not doing it on my phone, even though I can type very fast on my phone. And I can really
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:56.240]  like, think it out on the phone. I just like save that kind of work for my Mac. Yeah, I do.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.840]  Even like, you know, it just feels like like, oh, I had to sign a PDF and send it back the
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.640]  other day. And I was like, I know I can do this on this phone. I know I could do it on the iPad.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.800]  The iPad actually might be easier because you have like the pen. I don't even know if that was
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.480]  really true anymore. Because I like have my signature saved in preview. And it's just easy.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:25.760]  But like, I know I can do that in, I don't know, a few seconds on my Mac. Like, I'm just I just feel
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:33.280]  my fastest. You've got the new Apple TV remote? I don't. Oh, you don't have it yet? No, you know
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.800]  what Apple didn't send it to me. I bought it. It's still stuck in shipping. Hmm. Well, I felt like
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:44.560]  you know, I didn't want to pressure them to send it to me because I have hated my remote so much.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:53.680]  I've, I've reviewed alternate remotes. I have tweeted at every second I can that I when I lose
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:58.560]  the remote, I make a big fuss about it. And I said, I'm just gonna buy this remote and I'll see.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.520]  I'll wait as long as I have to. But I liked your review of it. I'm very excited to get it.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.160]  I made a mistake though. And I think I reiterated it in my podcast last week with Marco, where
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:18.000]  I somehow thought that you could use the the click wheel where you just run your finger around in a
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.360]  wheel to scroll up and down lists the way that you could on an old iPod. But you can't what happens
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:31.360]  is if you try that it does move the selection. But as you go down, it's going down and you get
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.240]  to the bottom of the circle and your thumb starts going up, it just makes the selection go back up.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.960]  So it's like you the selection, let's say you're in the TV or the TV OS settings app,
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.240]  and there's a list of you go to settings and there's a list of like 10 sections. And you
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:54.560]  want to scroll down and you start running your thumb down the wheel. It's like it goes down for
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.480]  and then you get to the bottom and your thumb goes up and it goes back up and it just
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:04.800]  cycles between the top four items. And I so I don't know what made me think that was working,
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.960]  but it did. I thought it was maybe it's because I didn't try to go far enough down. I just
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:14.320]  scrolled a little bit and it went down and I was like cool. But it really at the moment in TV OS,
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.560]  it really that the scroll wheel thing only works for scrubbing and video, but it's fantastic for
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.960]  scrubbing and video because you don't have to keep picking your thumb up going swipe, swipe,
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:30.080]  swipe, swipe, you can just run your finger over and you're like, I'm going halfway through this
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.560]  two hour movie to get to the part I want to watch. And it doesn't work for volume, right? You have the
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.000]  dedicated volume there. Yeah, the wheel does not work for volume. You just use the volume buttons.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.600]  Yeah, I'm looking at your picture and your review and I read your review. I think,
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.160]  you know, obviously the size for me was a is a huge thing. I'm actually
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.880]  like, stupidly excited about the power button. It's nice. It really is. It's because sometimes
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:02.080]  you're hitting the menu button to turn on and you're not sure if that's working. And you keep
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.000]  hitting menu and then you see the light on the Apple TV turn on. You're like, I think that's
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.320]  what the menu button did. But yeah, and then it takes a while to load. I'm just I think the power
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.200]  button is a nice shortcut. And it's like, you know what you did with it. Apple's always had this
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.000]  thing where they obviously are the the most button averse technology company known to known to
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.320]  mankind. And like the original Apple TV remote look like it only had like three buttons. And
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.480]  it's they love to reduce buttons. And one of the buttons they always think they can get rid of is
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.960]  a power button. And it's like then it all then they always bring it back. It's like, yeah, you
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.680]  kind of want a power button. And it's like holding down something that you wouldn't think of a power
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:50.960]  button at to say that's how you turn it off. It it it I could not agree more. And I really hope
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:57.360]  we see the power button come back on the MacBook Pro. I don't know how they could do that. I but
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.200]  why not? Why not? Just make it a little piece of aluminum in the corner like they did with the
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.120]  remote and then it doesn't stick out. It's not it's not like on this how it used to be remember
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.720]  it had you had the little black the little Yep, silver aluminum button in the top right. Yep.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.840]  And it was bare. It was you know, flush with the silver and with the aluminum and it was great.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.560]  Yeah. So here now constantly sometimes you I don't really restart my Mac that much. But
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.040]  when I do and I'm like is the fingerprint sensor turning this on? Like what is something happening
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:32.720]  here? Yeah. So here's another story I've heard I have no official confirmation of this. But
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:41.520]  do you know you how like if you power down your MacBook now and it's off and you touch any of the
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:50.000]  keys and or press any of the keys like the J key or the Q key, any key, it turns on the MacBook,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.440]  you can just hit any key on the keyboard and it turns on a powered off MacBook. And it's like,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.840]  oh, that's interesting. That's cool. But it's like, how do you clean the keyboard? Like if
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.840]  you would just like to take a cloth and just rub it over the keys, and just sort of take off your
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.600]  finger grease and everything like that. You can't do it without turning on the MacBook. And I it's
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:17.440]  not a the greatest use case because I guess while it's powering up, if you're pressing mashing all
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.000]  these keys down as you wipe the grease off, it's fine. But why what's what's the point? Like what
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.080]  who wants this? And apparently, this is what I've heard, but I have no confirmation of. But it that
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:36.320]  feature came after they added the touch ID button that doubles as a power button. And the touch ID
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:42.960]  button doesn't have a power logo on it, I guess because if they put the screen printed logo on
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.480]  top, it would interfere with the sensor's ability to see your fingerprint. And because there's no
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.240]  button that looks like a power icon. People didn't people didn't know how to turn their MacBooks on.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:59.040]  And they were like going to the Apple Store, like, I don't know how to turn this on. I swear, I
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:03.920]  don't believe it. I totally believe it. Because I'm that's what I'm sort of saying is that I just
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:08.720]  always am like pressing the fingerprint button pretty hard to like turn it on. And actually,
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:14.160]  I think I thought that's how you turned on the computer. Could you just thank you for telling
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:21.040]  me that's not because it works. But it just seems like such a funny FAQ that no other computer
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:28.480]  company would ever turn on this fucking product. Like the Apple, the company that famously makes
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.640]  the easiest to use computers anybody's ever made. And the one thing that people don't know how to
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.040]  do is turn it on. Also with the iMac, like I've set this thing up. I mean, I don't want to say
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:46.160]  that I spent like, much more than I don't know, 20 seconds looking for that power button, but I
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.240]  definitely was like fumbling around with it to find the power button in the back, which is the
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.160]  same color as the as the back, right? So you're kind of like, you know, like, no, it should be
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.320]  back here. Where is it? Where is it? And you're like, you know, moving this thing around. Luckily,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.040]  this is very light and thin. So it's not a big deal. Yeah, bring the color. I mean, bringing the
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.920]  color conversation full circle. They should do what they with the pixel does, which is a different
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:18.880]  color. Power button. Hmm. Yeah, maybe I do. They make it two tone power button. Yeah, I just I'm
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.720]  all in favor of a dedicated power button and just make it little they could just use the same little
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.040]  button from the remote just a little button up there. You could just well then also I so I have
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:33.440]  bought I've done two things to try to fix the shitty old Siri remote. The first thing was I
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:37.840]  bought one of those cases on Amazon. It's like, you know, have you seen these like silicon? I've
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.880]  had several. They're all had several because they're all fine. They're all like $7. You know,
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.640]  yeah. But they're fine. You know, it makes it a little bit bigger. You can tell up from down
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.920]  its color. So you can kind of recognize it when it falls in between the cushions. But then I also
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.400]  bought this other one, which was actually sent to me for review, because I'd been tweeting about how
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.120]  much I hated the remote at some point and this company called function 101 small company and
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.800]  they made this Apple TV replacement remote and it doesn't do Siri it doesn't do voice but it does
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.440]  everything else and it's like big and it has a power button up in the corner and the buttons
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:21.680]  it has like the rubbery feel so everything like bounces and I love this thing. Oh, I think I do
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.320]  know that. Yeah, what the name was function 101 wasn't ringing a bell but there are a couple no
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:33.680]  name. But it is also how crazy is it? Like, whatever you want to say about the price of the
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:40.400]  Apple TV hardware starting at like 180 or I know they still sell the $150 one that's crazy. It's
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.360]  the old it's like an A7 chip and it only does 1080. But how crazy is it that there's $180 set
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:54.160]  top box that comes with a remote that there's a cottage industry not just for these $7 rubber
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:00.160]  sleeves, but for entirely replacing the remote control? Yeah, this is a $40 remote and it was
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:07.600]  like the best purchase I think I made last year. So I'm excited to use the new one and then it
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.560]  sounds like it and the thickness of it it really it makes a difference. Oh, I think it's so much
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:17.040]  better. I just love to hold it in my hand while I while we watch TV now and I just keep it there
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:21.360]  and like kind of fit you know like fidget with it like just spin it around in my hand. It's sure
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.080]  your wife loves that you don't hold my hand. No, sorry, I'm holding the remote. No, I hold it in
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.920]  my left hand and she's on my right and we hold hands. We hold hands. Oh, that's beautiful. But
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:38.080]  it is it's it's just a beautiful slab of aluminum that feels great in the hand and it just I just
[01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:46.800]  cannot believe that it took five and a half years for Apple to ship it. Yeah, I mean, it's ordered.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:52.800]  You had recently I forget when what this was in response to was it after the event where
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.760]  you had the interview with Craig Federighi? It was before it was actually I did do the interview
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:06.560]  the day after the event, or two days after the event, but it was pre iOS 14.5 where they he
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:12.720]  wanted to talk about it. And yeah, right. This was sort of instead of talking about the privacy stuff
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:20.720]  in iOS 14.5 during the event, they didn't even mention it. They instead did some press and
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.040]  Craig's interview video interview with you was my favorite. And it was crazy. This is where
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:34.320]  I really do. I would love to razz you. But it's like I just have to praise you that you got this
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.440]  crazy short amount of time. Didn't they say you have like, you've got like 15 minutes with them
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.320]  or something like that? 15 minutes. Yeah, it's insane. You've got 15 minutes with Craig Federighi
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.480]  to talk about these complex issues. And you ended up with this six minute, six, seven minute video
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.960]  that was super tight and just like, boom, boom, boom, this is great. Including my favorite
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.880]  question, which was why does the button it's like, you get asked, you know, an app wants to track
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:10.720]  you. And the one button says, allow and the other button says, ask not to track. Why not disallow?
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:18.640]  Right? Why not? Or do not track do not track. And the answer was, they have to ask, they still have
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.320]  to you're asking some some part is that Apple is saying, we will not allow them to track some
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:29.920]  things, but some things are up to the developer, right? And so you have to you're basically asking
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.480]  that app not to track you. There's some technical reasons behind the scenes, that they can't be
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:43.840]  sure. Right. Apple doesn't see all the data flow. So it has to sort of rely and trust this developer
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:49.920]  not to do it. Right. And I that's sort of what I was thinking. But hearing Federighi say it, it
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.960]  was like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Because the basic gist is, okay, you click ask not to
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:02.960]  ask not to track. And Apple can cut the app off from API access to the device identifier and the
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:08.880]  ad identifier. And there's these API's that the app just no longer has access to same way. If you
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:15.120]  say this app does not have access to location, then that app can just can't ask the phone. Hey,
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.840]  where are we? What's our GPS that just that the API says no, you don't have permission for it.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:24.720]  They can do that for these identifiers, but they can't keep the app from coming up with other
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:31.440]  schemes to fingerprint and, and write and track you even though you asked not to be. So all you
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:40.080]  can do is ask and Apple isn't willing to make it seem as though if you if you had a button that
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:48.000]  said don't track, you would expect that you can't be tracked. Right. Yeah, it's sort of an honor
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.680]  policy part on the developers. And you kind of get the feeling like a lot of these developers
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.520]  maybe don't have so much honor. Yeah, I think that there's probably some shady things. I mean,
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.360]  now that I think about it, as you're saying it, Apple could have probably done and this also goes
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.760]  to something else he said, which is they probably could have done a two pop up, right? One, don't
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.040]  have this ad ID track me. And then to ask the developer not to use other ways to track, but
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.800]  that would have been a bad user experience, right? Like you wouldn't. So, which is what he talked a
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:25.280]  lot about, which was that we tried to make this simple. It's a really complex thing to begin with
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:32.080]  ad tech is so mad. It's just like crazy confusing. We want to try to make it as easy for the user.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.960]  But this is the best we could basically do right now. I read, I will put it in the show notes, I'm
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.160]  going to make a list right here, because I was going to link to it later today anyway. But I
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:49.760]  read an interesting Twitter thread today from somebody who works in not the tracking part, but
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.800]  in the privacy part of trying trying to make things more private. I'm not even sure where he
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.320]  works. But he had a Twitter thread where he said he was just visiting his mother. Oh, I saw this
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.000]  about the toothpaste. Yeah, about the toothpaste. Yeah. And it's this specific brand of toothpaste
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.440]  that his mother uses at her house. And he'd been there for a few days. And then all of a sudden on
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.640]  Twitter, he started getting ads for this brand of toothpaste. And he said, we never talked about it.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:21.360]  Nobody while I was there, nobody ever talked about whatever brand it is, he doesn't mention it. And
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.720]  all of a sudden, he's getting these ads. And this is the sort of thing that spooks people. But his
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:35.920]  explanation for how how is this even possible is basically, okay, he's given Twitter his email, he
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:42.000]  also has his email connected to his credit card. So he if he makes purchases using his credit card
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.160]  at a drugstore that the purchase can be associated with his email, then it could go into the ad
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.800]  tracking system. And they're like, well, we know this guy's email. He's this, you know, at whoever
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.560]  on Twitter. That's the same guy. What did he buy? What did he buy at Walgreens? Oh, he bought
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.600]  Colgate. He said, Okay, but he didn't buy the toothpaste. His mother did. But then they can if
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:10.080]  any of the apps involved have access to location, then they can say, Well, who else has been near
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:17.520]  him? Oh, he's been near this woman. And she's bought Colgate. And therefore, it all goes through
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.360]  the system. And then all of a sudden, he's getting ads for his mother's brand of toothpaste, even
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.040]  though nobody talked about it.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.240]  Yeah, it's just like I read his tune. I was like, of course, right? I mean, I guess I've been
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:36.160]  covering this for now since three or four or five years now. And, yeah, some of the things are more
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:45.280]  nuanced. But it's like, it's always shocking to me how little the user really knows. And how complex
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:49.600]  these systems are. But also, like, at this point that it's like, yeah, of course, that's how it
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.160]  happened.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:58.400]  And like how big these databases are of all of this information. But then it does come down to
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:06.640]  these very specific and like, oh, yeah, I guess so focal points of how to make the connections
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:13.680]  between this soup, this absolute massive soup of data. But it's like, you're it's the same email
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:20.240]  address there and the same email address here. And that means it's you.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.080]  Yeah, I mean, I did this piece, you know, a couple years ago, when everyone was really trying to
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:29.040]  figure out how Facebook, you know, it was all in response to Facebook listening to our mics. And I
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.520]  did this piece a number of years ago where it was like, they're not listening. And this is because I
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.720]  thought I was like, how did they know I was sick? Like, I went and I got like, Sudafed and all this
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.160]  stuff. And I started getting all the ads for all like, all this allergy. Yeah, I think it was I had
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.160]  like the flu or something. And I was like, how did they know? Right? Like, it's like, oh, they
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:54.640]  listening to me sneeze all this like, and it was so clear after I just put together the fact that
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:03.360]  I went to Walgreens, and my Facebook account has the same email or like, basically same login.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:10.000]  Yeah, and or something, right? Yeah, some kind of identifier. Yeah. And I think, you know, so much
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.800]  of the algorithms powering all of this stuff now, too, is just like, this stuff is all being shared.
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.960]  And so it's not to me, it's like something's like, I'm not surprised that they know this about me
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:28.480]  now. Yeah. That's why I know it's complex. And I think Apple, in my opinion, is making it a little
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:38.720]  bit worse to to to be staunchly on Apple's side of this debate, by also ramping up their own
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:45.680]  advertising stuff to a small degree in the App Store, right, like they just added a new ad unit
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:51.520]  on the search page, where before you even search in the App Store, now there's an ad unit there.
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.720]  And they say, you know, because they're their whole thing is about third party ad tracking.
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.040]  And first party tracking is a okay, right. So like, whatever you do in Facebook can affect what
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.600]  you see in Instagram, because that's all first party, it stays within Facebook's properties.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:13.760]  And the App Store is considered first party to Apple. And that they say, you know, based on your
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.920]  previous downloads, and the maybe the type of games you like to, to download to your iPhone,
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:27.440]  to download to your iPhone, they, they will use that to show ads in the App Store to you. And
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:38.320]  none of it is it that the pro Apple part of this is I have never heard one person ever say I got
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.680]  a creepy ad in the App Store for an app, right. And in fact, most of the ones I see, and I
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.840]  download apps all the time. They're all just for nonsense games that I have no interest in. It's
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.520]  all games, and I have no interest in it. And they're nothing like any of the games I've ever
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:58.000]  played. It's not creepy, right? There's sort of, and I know, I overuse this phrase, Nilay always
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.440]  complains about it that that I overuse the justice potter thing about obscenity that I know it when I
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:12.480]  see it. But the legal argument about that is Nilay's argument that it's it's not a good way
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:19.520]  to do it legally. But it in a common sense, real life way, I know it when I see it is such a great
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:27.760]  rule of thumb. And I know a creepy ad when I see it. And the stuff Apple's doing isn't creepy. But
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:35.600]  it just seems like a conflict of interest that they're doing this thing that Facebook publicly,
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:42.080]  to their credit is very public. They're not just like back channeling their complaints. They're
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.720]  very public that they think what Apple's doing is wrong and hurting small businesses and
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.080]  whatever else. But at the same moment that they're rolling this out, they're also expanding their
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.360]  advertising in the App Store and they don't need it's like of all the things they don't need that
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:06.240]  money. That is literal pocket change to Apple. So why why do it? Why not just eliminate the conflict
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.320]  of interest? I just guess to play devil's advocate, and I don't know enough about this, the journals
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.400]  had a few stories about it, is also part of this to appease some of the developers who are worried
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:26.960]  about getting that sort of cross, losing out on the in app ads. And so we're, how do I explain
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:32.000]  this where the idea is that some developers are where they stand to lose people coming to their
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:39.200]  apps is to not be able to advertise anymore in one app, right? Because you don't know as much
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.880]  information now because of ATT, because of all the tracking that's being turned off. So you don't
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.640]  know as much about who could download your app, right? Like, maybe I should put this in simpler
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:57.760]  terms. Let's say you are the maker of a coffee mug company, and you want to advertise to other
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:04.000]  people who have downloaded coffee apps. Well, you might not get that information anymore. So it's
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.280]  harder to advertise in those apps, right? Yeah, now, but so here, you can still reach some of
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.120]  those people. Well, it's not for the product is for the app. But like, let me reverse, I do not
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:23.120]  really think through this this metaphor here. But now you can place those ads in the store, which
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:31.760]  are using the first party data from Apple, if any of this makes sense. Yeah, I guess it, I don't
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:38.160]  know, it's just all a bit, it just would be so much, it would be almost 100% clean as an argument
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:45.200]  if they just weren't if they just moved away from advertising in the App Store, right. And I agree.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.880]  And the other thing too, is I don't think that the search result ads are a good user experience.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.960]  I don't think I don't pay attention to those. I just I just it's like when you type in the name
[01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:05.360]  of a very specific app, like overcast, overcat, you type in overcast podcast, and you hit return.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:12.560]  And the first result is some other podcast app that placed, you know, outbid Marco Arment for
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:18.480]  the word overcast today on on the App Store. It's like, I'm not fooled. I know what I'm looking for.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:23.120]  I just typed overcast. It's like there it is the second one down that let me install it on this
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:29.760]  new iPad that I'm setting up. Is it that and it just seems like so many of the ads aren't like
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:38.480]  like if somebody just types in podcast app, okay, sure, maybe then it's a good time to to to allow
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:45.360]  somebody to advertise on the term. But so many of the terms that that the advertisers are clearly
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.280]  bidding on are rival apps names. And I know that Apple mentioned this when they rolled out these
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:59.520]  ads, they specifically addressed that concern. And they pitched it as it gives small developers
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:06.240]  a chance to get prominence over the big name apps that might otherwise show up first. But what I see
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.680]  in day to day use is it's the bigger name apps that always have those spots because they've got
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.680]  the money to spend on the ads. Exactly. I mean, and I feel like I never really noticed them unless
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.360]  it's something that doesn't really make sense. Yeah. Right. I guess I'm also usually like you're
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.200]  saying I'm searching for a specific app and I'm going to find it in I'm going to look for that
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.640]  specifically. So I'm not really usually focused for Oh, maybe there's a better solution here.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:41.600]  I don't usually search for like a generic. I'd like a workout app or I'd like a streaming app.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:47.520]  It's like, hey, I want Netflix. Right. But you and I are, you know, not typical. We know a lot
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.080]  of the apps we're looking for already. And I suspect a lot of real people do search for generic
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:58.880]  terms. But it's sort of like they're repeating the maybe not even mistakes. But you could you
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:08.240]  could watch this happen to Google search results over the last 20 years, you can see how it users
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.480]  started ignoring remember when the ads were in a blue box, and it was kind of you know, it wasn't
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:18.720]  like a it was like the powder blue from the iMac, right? It was like a subtle blue box, but they
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.480]  were definitely in a box and you knew which ones were ads. And there was often only one or two. And
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.800]  they got less and less relevant when you were for some search terms, and people just trained
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.680]  their eyes to go from the box you type your Google search in to underneath the ads, you would just
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:44.320]  your eyes, it's like you developed like a natural blind spot to it. And then as users got that blind
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:51.840]  spot, Google started adding more ads so that you know that the ads would jump down, scroll down
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.120]  lower to where your eyes were going. And then all of a sudden, now they've got a lot of ads, right?
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:27:02.720]  And it's like if you showed a screenshot of Google search today for some results to a Google user
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.080]  from like 2005, they would be like, Oh, my God, that's terrible. You know, what happened to Google?
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.800]  And it was just like, I can sort of see that happening to the App Store now. It's like, and I
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:22.800]  and I just think that given that Apple has taken this, we're taking on the tracking advertising
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:30.160]  industry, which effectively is the online advertising industry. It's it just adds this
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.880]  little bit of a sour taste to a position where I think they're 98% correct on.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.760]  Yeah. And I think you're right just about the general. Just like if you're going to take this
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:48.480]  stance and be so hard on the ad industry, which really is I do believe benefiting in some really
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.040]  important ways. And anytime I interview people within the ad industry, they seem to, like, I
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:55.840]  don't know if it's just, you know, that's what they want to say, because they're talking to a
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.680]  reporter and they want to be like, you know, they don't want to sound like Facebook and say, Hey,
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:06.480]  we want all this data. But if you're going to play that role, like, maybe just Yeah, put up the wall,
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.720]  right? Just just don't be in that business.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:12.880]  All right. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our third sponsor, another new sponsor,

[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.480]  What else? What else with the Craig interview? I thought that was so good. I was so jealous
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:21.280]  because I feel like and now I'm like, I don't know who I'm working on plans for a WWDC talk show.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.640]  I have I don't know what's going on yet. I will be I guess remote again this year since all of
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:33.920]  WWDC is remote. But I feel like I watched so much of yours last year. I mean, I remember watching
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.040]  it, but then I rewatched it for preparing for this. Because well, for two things, one, I wanted
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.000]  to get a feeling for what he's like in an interview. And of course, I've watched a lot,
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.960]  but I needed to, I needed to refresh my memory. And then two, I was like, what was the tech setup
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.520]  that you had? And I was, I mean, I texted you because I was studying it. I was like, okay, so
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.880]  he's got a different camera in front of him. So but are they all using iPhone cameras? And how
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.360]  did this all sync? And you told me all of it, which was very helpful.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:08.320]  It's all it's all now that we're getting close to WWDC, it all just feels like this giant pit of
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:15.840]  despair. Because you got to do it again. And as nervous as I am, when I do the show in front of
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.520]  a theater audience, I feel like, well, that it can't really go wrong. Like, and if somebody's
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.360]  there, a professional camera person is there, and I don't have to worry about the camera.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:31.120]  And the audience is there, I just walk out on stage. And if I misspeak, I can recover. Whereas,
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:38.320]  I was terrified in this, doing the WWDC thing last June, where it was like, I couldn't really
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.920]  have anybody, you know, for quarantine helping me. And I was so terrified that it wasn't actually
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.040]  recording. Well, this year, hopefully you can, but you did a great job. Because I was looking at
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:55.120]  somebody must have been there with him. I did have I did have help setting it up. But then when I did
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:01.360]  the show, I was in the room by myself, but it was that we everybody, me, Federighi and Jaws were all
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:08.960]  using iPhone cameras. I, you know, had a real lav mic, but the trick with using the iPhone camera
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:16.960]  to record it, while looking at them on screen on a MacBook was to set the the phone up on a tripod
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:24.960]  behind the MacBook, with just as close as possible to the top of the screen. And with just the camera
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.600]  peeking over the top, but also not so low, you don't want to get a little bit of the MacBook in
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:34.320]  the frame either, right? Well, and then were you what you were watching them on some video chat?
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.600]  Because I it looked like everyone was basically looking directly in the camera. So I was like,
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.880]  maybe they just did this audio. No, and it was I forget which app we use. I forget if I know
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:50.080]  Apple likes to use that WebEx Cisco WebEx, but I don't think we used WebEx for the show. But
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:55.520]  whatever we did, what I did was I shrunk the window as small as I could, where I could still
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:02.320]  see the facial expressions of Jaws and Craig, but put it at the top of the screen. So as I
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:07.360]  was looking at them, it looked like I was looking as close as possible to the camera. And I have to
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:12.240]  say I do have to say it turned out as good as I thought it could possibly turn out. Yeah, it was
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:16.880]  really good. I mean, it just felt like everyone was looking at the camera conversation. You know,
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.000]  it's everything you it that I was also very jealous is what it was like an hour, hour or
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.640]  something. Yeah. Well, officially an hour and I think we went like 70 minutes or something like
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.200]  that. Yeah. And like the editing, you could tell it was definitely there was no editing.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:36.400]  It was just kind of cuts back and forth. But it flowed really nicely. Well, that was my friends
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.360]  at sandwich video who did the did the editing between the three cameras of footage and the
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:45.840]  Apple guys cheat because they have a whole crew there to help them out. So they had more they had
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:50.480]  they had two cameras on each of them. So there were actually I guess five cameras of footage.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.360]  And my friends at sandwich video did the editing and just sort of made it you know, it's you know,
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.800]  it looked like a TV show where you don't even notice that it's cutting between different camera
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:03.600]  angles. Yeah, I mean, that was, you know, this huge challenge on our part, my producer Kenny,
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.680]  I was like, you just got to make me look as good as Apple is going to make Federighi look so good
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:15.360]  luck. I know any other cheat that they have to is that they set up in these sunlit hallways. Yeah,
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:22.240]  you know, with the full so much depth and like 18 foot floor to ceiling windows of California
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:29.520]  sunshine in the jet genuine architectural marvel that is the Apple Park ring. And I think they've
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.320]  just got a ton of lights on the back. It's just like, yeah, it's not fair. And, you know, he just,
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:40.320]  he looks great. But I mean, I think I looked pretty good too. Kenny did a great job. Yeah,
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:46.720]  you did. Yeah, Kenny did. Yeah, it's. But yeah, that was super. I was stressed. I was so stressed
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:51.680]  because I was like, how am I going to do this in 15 minutes? And it's like, it's like, it's like,
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.960]  every, you know, it's hard because it was about a topic. And I was excited to talk about that topic.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:04.480]  But you also have access to somebody where, like, you want to talk about so many other topics,
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.600]  like, like, like on this sort of podcast I have with you, it's like, how many topics do I talk
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.800]  about a year where I'm like, if I could just ask someone at Apple on the record, why there are no
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:21.360]  power buttons, you know, or, and I did some things didn't make it to the edit. But like, you know,
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.680]  I just had to get in a couple questions like, so do you charge your iPhone? I just want to ask,
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:31.680]  like, do you charge your iPhone with a with a cord? Yeah, and he does. He does. He's a cord guy.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.600]  And I was like, I just need to know that for my own, you know, because like, wireless charging
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:41.680]  kind of sucks, right? Like, I mean, we didn't really get into that, because I was so pressed
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.200]  for time. But I was just like, you know, so a couple of questions I did throw in, I wasted
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.200]  probably a minute on like some things I was interested in, and some of those made it in.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.160]  But yeah, it's tough. It's, I mean, it's, it's, you got to go in with a strategy. I had a very
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:58.640]  clear strategy. I had my minutes blocked out. I was keeping an eye on the time, you know,
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.200]  I got to keep it moving. I got to get to the stuff that I want to get to. And of course,
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.880]  like, it's, you know, that's, I think something that's so some of the best interviewers, I mean,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:11.120]  you watch Oprah, and you're just like, it's amazing, because it, you know, she has a strategy.
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:16.560]  You know, she is so careful about where she's starting and where she's going. But it does,
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:22.000]  you know, the viewer doesn't know that. No, I watched the Oprah interview with
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:31.840]  the prince and what's her name? Markle? Yeah, yeah. And I watched it. And I was thinking,
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.680]  it was, you know, a couple months ago, I guess, at this point, but I was already starting to worry
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:42.160]  about my WWDC article. And I did. And I was like, let me think about this at that sort of study.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.720]  And I'm like, Oh, my God, this is why Oprah is a billionaire. She's, I know. Yeah.
[01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:56.000]  Because she, it makes it, it's like, it's like, just like the butter on a hot piece of bread. And
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.920]  it's just, it's like, it's just so smooth. And it just disappears. And it's like, Oh, yeah,
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:07.520]  but she has a total strategy and agenda here. And she has totally, it seems like they're driving
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.400]  this because she's letting them talk. And and they're saying these things that became
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.560]  major celebrity news worldwide. But it's like, oh, Oprah is totally driving this bus.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.320]  Yeah, I mean, interviewing is such an art. And I do a lot of on stage interviewing or pre pandemic
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.480]  was on stage, just like you're saying, like, you know, you're up on stage. And that's a very
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:35.840]  different art than doing it on zoom. I mean, like, you know, this video calling interview
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.080]  type of thing is very hard. It's not like podcasts where there's like this conversation.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:48.400]  It just, it's very stifling, I find because you don't have the audience. It's somewhere between
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:55.200]  the like podcast and the stage, but you don't have the audience to really drive and you don't
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.760]  know what the reactions are. And I felt like, you know, I was getting pretty good on stage,
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:02.960]  we do a lot of these big tech events at the journal, and I get to interview some of the
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.840]  biggest people. And I was like, Okay, I'm finding my voice here. I'm really moving. And then we all
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:14.160]  are under lockdown. And I'm like, I'm horrible at this. The audience reactions in a live audience to
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:22.160]  me is like, it's like when I haven't played I when I used to play basketball, and it's like,
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:28.160]  well, there's a timeout a couple minutes in and I'm already sweaty and thirsty. And there's water
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.480]  and I can get it's like, ah, now I'm thirsty. Whereas doing it without the audience over
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.760]  zoom, or WebEx or whatever is like playing a whole game of basketball without ever getting
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.880]  a glass of water. It's like it's like those those audience reactions, laughter or applause
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:52.480]  or anything like that. It's like, it's like an emotional, just slurp of water when you're thirsty.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:58.240]  And totally and you can read it like, yeah, there isn't that it's like, okay, people seem really
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:03.280]  interested in this topic or you know, like, it might not inform like a follow up question,
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.760]  but it definitely can inform like, I should stay here or I should move to something else.
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:16.000]  So I laughed at your interview with with Federighi though, because you did work in funny
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.080]  questions. You literally asked him if it's true that Tim Cook calls him Superman.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.440]  I mean, he said no, but I don't believe him.
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:31.360]  And then you I thought it was very interesting and a good use of your time, even though it you
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.080]  know, the topic was abstracting transparency. And I feel like you know, you got four solid minutes
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.520]  of it in. You challenged Craig to do it. He was like, how quickly can you do it? And he was like,
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.960]  I don't know, I think I could do it in six seconds. And it was like six and a half seconds.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.560]  You you got the stuff, but then you asked about there was a recent Tim Cook interview
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:56.800]  where he was asked, do you you know, do you think you'll still be CEO of Apple 10 years from now?
[01:39:56.800 --> 01:40:00.880]  And he said, well, 10 years a long time, probably not. But I have, you know, no plans right now.
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:08.240]  And you know, he is I think 61. There's so six, you know, and so that makes sense, you know,
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:12.480]  that 10 years from now, he'd be 71. And you know, he might retire between now and then.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:21.120]  But yeah, so you get but you get, you know, locked into thinking Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple,
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:29.360]  right. And he's been there now since Steve Jobs died in 2011. So he's been there 10 years,
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:35.760]  you know, and I guess, you know, some somewhere 15, 16, 17 to 20 year run would be a heck of a
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:42.560]  run at and, you know, good, you know, especially for a high pressure job. But then it does, it
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:49.680]  makes you wonder, well, who's next? And the Jeff Williams would be the well, if they do the same
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.120]  thing before where the CEO takes over as CEO, it would be Jeff Williams. But Jeff Williams is like,
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.800]  only like one year younger than Tim Cook. And so you asked, you know, Federighi, would you do it?
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:07.280]  And I thought his answer was so funny, but also sort of like, hmm, right.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.680]  Yeah, like, I'm a big shot. You know, like, yeah, I mean, he, what did he say? That's insanity.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:21.280]  Yeah. He's like, ah, that's insane. Come on. No way. Yeah. Yeah. John Syracuse is charming.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.040]  He's so super charming.
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.080]  I mean, that's another thing, you know, as you're, you have a strategy
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.880]  as the interviewer, but then, you know, the interviewee has a strategy and they, you know,
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.680]  it was so clear to me. Well, first of all, he's just so good. I mean, he's just such a,
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:44.240]  well, he's so well-spoken, but also clearly believes in what he's saying. Right? Like,
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:48.400]  I mean, I can't say how many executives I interview and just like, oh, you're reading
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:55.280]  your marketing points. Okay. And so, yeah, I mean, that like the first, I mean, it was really 10
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.880]  minutes on ATT and then I bought some extra time, you know, asking privacy in general and then some
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:08.000]  of these extra questions. But I mean, he was, you could tell, like, prepared, but also knew sort of
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.640]  what he wanted to get across. Yeah, I don't think he was ready for you to ask him if he might be
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:19.760]  the next CEO of Apple. So, Syracuse on the ATP podcast, when that came out, said that he thought
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.080]  he would have thought going in that Craig Federighi sees himself as having achieved the
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:28.480]  pinnacle, because he's an, he is an engineer. I mean, he really, he really gets it. And so,
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.000]  you know, he, and he's a software engineer in particular, he's not a hardware person. So, as a
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.720]  software person who's interested in, in the sort of software Apple makes, how can you go higher
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.800]  than being the head of software, all software for Apple, and that he's already, you know,
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:48.480]  gotten there. And then like Syracuse said, when he watched your video, it was sort of like,
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.760]  huh, maybe he is thinking about it. Like, there was just something about the answer that was just,
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.320]  Well, I think he's a builder. Yeah. Right. And so I think that's,
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.960]  Tim Cook, I mean, is an amazing builder, but more of this, this vision. It's not the visionaries,
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:11.520]  the strategy guy, and just map it out. And it's kind of amazing where he's gone, come from,
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.560]  and what he's done with the strategy of the company. But you could get the sense that the
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:22.880]  next leader would be more of a visionary and a builder of product, like product, right? Like,
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.800]  yeah, exactly. Like the, the, the engineer type, right?
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:32.000]  Let me take one last break here. Thank our fourth and final sponsor. This one's not a new sponsor.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.560]  It's our good friends at you guessed it, Squarespace. I love Squarespace. This is where
[01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.320]  you go. It's your all in one platform for building a website. And you can put anything on it, a blog,
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:52.000]  a podcast, a store, a catalog, a portfolio of your work. You can do it all. They have it all built
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.640]  in. You can register your domain name there. You can set up your template. You can tweak your
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.000]  template. You can use it as your CMS. Like what do you, all right, I set up a blog on Squarespace.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:09.040]  How do I add a new post? You do it on Squarespace. It is literally entirely all in one. And why did,
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:16.400]  why did they sponsor the show almost every episode? Because people from this show keep
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:23.040]  signing up for new Squarespace websites or sending people they know who asked them, what should I do
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:28.240]  for a new website? They tell them go to Squarespace and they give them the code from the show,
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:36.720]  which is squarespace.com slash talk show. You go there at squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:41.120]  They know you came from here. And remember that code talks that you get 30 days free,

[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:50.000]  oh, this is a freebie test account or something like that. It's the real deal. You get 30 days
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.320]  and then you have to pay if you want to keep it. And you use that same code talk show,
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:01.200]  you save 10%, order a year, pay for a year upfront, use this code. You save 10%. That's
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:07.520]  like getting over a month free. So my thanks to Squarespace for their continuing support of the
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:16.080]  show. Last, last licks here, last topics. I'm curious if you, I know you had a recent column
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:19.360]  that I somehow missed and then you pointed out to me, I was like, oh, this is exactly what I
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:26.240]  needed to know. The air tags versus tile. Oh yeah, air tags. That feels like 10 years ago,
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:33.200]  but it was just like two or three weeks ago that I had a drug dog in my house. This is just another
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:39.200]  day. What do you use? Marco and I talked about this last week. It's like, I don't know if it's
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.840]  a pandemic thing. Cause I'm still like not really going a lot of places. I haven't traveled. It's
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:49.520]  like now I'm going back to restaurants and stuff, but it's like, I don't have anything yet to put a
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:56.320]  tracker on. I do because, so I have started going back to the office a bit. We shoot some of the
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:02.400]  videos there and I've been doing some conferences from there. So my work ID, I constantly lose.
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:07.600]  And I mean, even just finding it after months of not coming to the office. So
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.680]  it's on my work ID, it's on my keys and I put one in my wallet. Right. And you can't even use it.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:20.800]  I'm sure you can't even get in the door to say, I lost my work ID. Like you need that work ID.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.120]  Yeah, exactly. And like, I mean, there's people there, but you know, I just set my license and
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.080]  get this and get that security thing. But also I lose my keys a lot. Like I don't lose them,
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:38.560]  but I just misplace them. I feel like I, I don't, I am not a keys loser and I don't know why.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:44.640]  Cause I lose all sorts of other things. I lose my Apple pencil all the time. God, I would instantly
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:51.360]  insta, you know, $200 for a new Apple pencil with the U1 chip so that I could make it. I could do
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.720]  it. I would just buy it and they're like no other features. It just, it's just the same Apple pencil
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:47:02.400]  has no new features, no extra resolution, no, no higher frame rate, but you can use Find My to find
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:08.160]  it with precision. I would be an insta buy for me because, and by the way, I think it is total BS
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:13.520]  that they didn't put it in the remote. I saw the, I saw the comment from, I forget what the name of
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:20.160]  the executive, but that it's too, that it's now too big to lose. That is like that, that engineer
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:26.640]  or whoever the executive does not have a kid is let me tell you that. My son is constantly hiding
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:32.560]  the remotes. I asked about that in a briefing after the event, I was like, just double checking
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.000]  that the remote doesn't have a U1 chip. And they acted, and it's the typical Apple reaction where
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:45.280]  it's like their action was like, it was as though I asked, hey, does it work in a complete vacuum?
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.160]  Like if I took it into outer space, you know, like, you know, they're, you know, like a totally
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:55.680]  random, weird question. Like, we did not build this to go into a complete vacuum. We don't,
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.560]  we don't know where that's what they acted. Like when I asked about the U1 chip, they're like,
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:07.760]  oh, who would ever need that for a skinny little remote control? It's like, no, I think that's a
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.840]  good question. And it's interesting, because I feel like they got asked enough where they came
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:16.400]  up with a new answer. And instead of, yeah, instead of acting like it's a crazy question,
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.000]  they're like, oh, nobody, this is a big remote. So it'll never get lost.
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:31.520]  So yeah, it was an interview with Mobile Syrup, and Apple VP Tim Turdell says it's too thick to
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:35.760]  easily lose in the couch. And that's, we don't need to. We're super excited about what we're
[01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:41.440]  doing with the U1. And yeah, with the changes we've made to the Siri remote, including making
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.080]  it a bit bigger, bigger, so it's thicker, so it won't fall in your couch cushions as much.
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.280]  Trenton Larkin How old is your son?
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.880]  Rachel Tompa He's three and a half,
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.480]  he's turning four next to two weeks.
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.760]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, so he takes the remote
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:55.360]  all over the place. So it's so funny.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.720]  Rachel Tompa But he also is hiding things,
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.240]  like he thinks it's funny to hide. He hid my wife's engagement ring the other day.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.360]  Trenton Larkin Oh my god.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:04.400]  Rachel Tompa Yeah, we're like, where is it? He's like,
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:10.080]  I'm not telling. Oh, you know, it's like, this is all it's like, hide, everything is hide and seek.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.040]  Rachel Tompa I should have done the whole video with him if I like wanted to show his face a lot,
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:17.520]  but yeah. Trenton Larkin
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:21.680]  You know what, it's only funny because I presume he eventually revealed the location.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.160]  Rachel Tompa He did. He did. Yeah.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.640]  Trenton Larkin No, we used to have a problem with Jonas when
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.000]  he was that age, even younger. I think it was just like from like, as soon as he could walk where he
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:38.640]  wanted the TV remote. And he, you know, he didn't even know how to use it. But he, he could see
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.560]  that that was the thing to have, right? If we're in front of the TV, the thing you want is the
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:47.760]  remote and he'd want it. And then it'd be like, okay, you can have it. And then it's like, you
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.800]  turn your head and you know, two and three year olds just like to wander off. And guess what he
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.160]  wanders off with the remote. Rachel Tompa
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:01.040]  Yeah. I mean, we have three Apple TV remotes in our living room, right? Two old Siri remotes.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:07.760]  Actually, I have four in the house, but two old Siri, the trackpad one, plus that function one
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.240]  that I mentioned before, right? Because like, we don't ever know where they're going.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.600]  Trenton Larkin And it's funny, too, because when
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:21.280]  Jonas was that age, our remote was the TiVo remote, the big P, we still have a TiVo, we still use it.
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:29.360]  But the big peanut TiVo remote, it can wander off, but it certainly is nowhere near as hideable as
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.160]  an Apple remote. Like you can't slip it somewhere, you know, it's a big three dimensional peanut
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.880]  shape. So, you know, there were only so many places he could go with it. But, you know,
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:42.400]  putting it in the toy box there, there you go, how you find that, you know, good luck.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.360]  Rachel Tompa Right, right. But overall, I mean,
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:50.400]  I really liked the AirTags. And I think the tile conversation is an interesting one. I know you
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:55.920]  had mentioned in your post, you know, one of the reasons like, you know, I think it was in context
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:02.960]  of why they may not go into the find my ecosystem or use that platform. And I did have a couple of
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:08.000]  discussions with tile and even with the CEO right before I was finishing the column. And it's very
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.640]  clear, like, they just feel like they'd have to give up so much control. And they don't, they
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:17.360]  don't want to do that. Yeah, they're not just selling the trackers, they are also building
[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:24.320]  their own network. And that the, you know, participating in find my is completely contrary
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:29.760]  to that. I'm not sympathetic to their anti competitive arguments about Apple, because I
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.120]  don't think I don't think it's wrong for the platform owner like Apple to build this into
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:40.080]  the platform because I think it belongs there. And I think it's always the case with innovators,
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:46.080]  like people think of innovative ideas, but if the innovative idea belongs in the parent product,
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:52.320]  and it's going to be popular, it's going to end up built in. I mean, Benedict Evans has tweeted
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:58.080]  this several times, but it used to be he always tweets up this old ad from like 1983, where there
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:03.200]  was this product you could buy for $300. It was a software product that would let you print your
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:09.600]  Lotus spreadsheets in landscape, because by default, Lotus only printed them vertical.
[01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:14.720]  And you could print them in landscape. And then if you had like a dot matrix printer,
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.800]  it could be really wide, right? It could just keep, you know, spewing across,
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:25.120]  you could make a really super wide spreadsheet. That was that was their product. Well, guess what,
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:30.000]  eventually every spreadsheet, every everything that you can ever print with added a little button
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.480]  that you can switch between landscape and horizontal, right? Of course, it got built in.
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:39.120]  But when when Lotus built it in this company was like, hey, you're ripping off our idea, you know.
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:45.200]  So I'm sympathetic. I'm sympathetic, but I don't think but on the other hand, I don't blame tile
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:49.040]  for not participating in find my because I do see that strategically, they want to own their own
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:54.160]  network of location. Yeah, and I mean, I've been thinking a lot about this, and I'm writing a piece
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:53:01.520]  pre WWDC about, you know, the the Apple garden, the walled garden. And, you know, really thinking
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.880]  about what's the harm, right? And what it because we've been hearing a lot about it, we heard about
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.480]  it through the epic case. And certainly there's a lot of, you know, when you think about the
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:15.840]  developer situation around the App Store there, that's that is a that is harm and much sometimes
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:20.480]  to consumers, but certainly to developers. And that's a conversation that is, in some ways,
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:25.360]  I view as separate. But when you think about that Apple keeps building some of this into its own
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.040]  platforms, whether it be some of the services, whether it be some of the software features,
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:35.920]  whether it be accessories that can work better, like, what is what ends up being the consumer
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.800]  harm? Like, what is bad for us? Right? And I don't want to give away too much of the video,
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:46.080]  but like, I may have found myself at a garden and it is beautiful in there. Right? Like,
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:52.640]  what? And so I've been thinking, I mean, I'd ask you, I mean, what do you feel? Is it? What is the
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.000]  what is bad for us? I think it's complicated. I think we could do another two hour show
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.160]  just about that. But I think that the key thing is that sometimes
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:13.120]  technologists forget that more there are always trade offs with power and more right. And so
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:18.480]  it is great that on the Mac, you can just download stuff from anywhere and you can just go to Google
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.920]  and get a copy of Chrome. And it's this entirely alternate browser with its own browser engine.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:28.800]  And you don't have to get it. You can't get it through the App Store because that's against the
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:32.880]  App Store rule. Even on the Mac, you can't go through the App Store if you're doing the stuff
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.080]  that Chrome does. But you can just install it on your Mac. And that's great. And you can't do that
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.520]  on the iPhone. The only way that they can have Chrome is to go through the App Store and they
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.480]  have to use Apple's WebKit engine. And there are limits to that. And there are features that
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.040]  the real Chrome has on the desktop that Chrome can't have on iOS because of that. And you're
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:55.280]  missing out on those features and technologists see, well, then that's therefore that's bad and
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:02.480]  Apple's being bad. But on the other hand, there's benefits to it where you cannot install a browser
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:07.120]  that's going to chew up your battery the way Chrome has on and off over the years, right?
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:12.560]  There's benefits to it. And Chrome does this thing that they run in the background to update Chrome.
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:18.080]  And there was a whole thing where Lauren Brikter found that the background agent was like crazily
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:25.040]  running up the CPU. The fact that you can't do anything on iOS to mess up your iOS device
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:32.400]  is a huge feature. It's a huge, huge feature. And it's the thing that people learned,
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.640]  especially on Windows, don't install software because if you install software, you're going
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:41.840]  to mess up your computer. And the fact that you can install anything you want from the app store
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:46.400]  and it'll never mess up your computer. And if you don't like it, you just tap and hold on it,
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:51.280]  hit the X button and every trace of it is gone. And there's nothing left behind that
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.880]  technically possible to be running in the background. That's a feature.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:00.880]  So that's that. That to me is the positive aspects of being in a walled garden, right?
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:05.040]  And I guess that's what you're getting at is that technologists say walled garden and they
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.440]  always mean it as bad. It's bad and limiting. You're in a walled garden. It's not good.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:10.160]  That's right.
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.880]  And no, but actually it can be really nice and peaceful and calm and safe.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.880]  Now you're getting, now you're getting, you're taking my piece for next week. So
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:23.120]  I will come back on the show and then just to bring it also full circle. I just was rapidly,
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.440]  did you hear my magic keyboard typing?
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:26.080]  Yeah.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.160]  I'm taking notes on what you're saying for my piece.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.600]  There you go. See?
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:30.240]  There you go.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.960]  That's great. See now, now listen, we got to keep this in on the show. We got to keep those
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.680]  keyboard noises in because then everybody who listens to my show, when they see your video,
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:42.240]  they'll see that's where the ideas came from. Anyway.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:45.120]  Yeah. We shot yesterday. I will say we shot yesterday. I have a sunburn.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:46.560]  Ooh.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:49.920]  Also really bad allergies. I actually made it through this whole show without
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.400]  telling you how high I am on allergy drugs.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.360]  And not making you think I'm like a crazy person.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:00.160]  I don't think there's any difference from the regular Joanna to be honest.
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:01.120]  There really isn't.
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.880]  All right. Joanna, always a pleasure to have you on the show. Thanks. Thanks for being
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:10.560]  here. Everybody, of course, can read your work at the Wall Street Journal and on Twitter
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:11.760]  at Joanna Stern.
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.400]  Yeah. And Instagram. I'm really trying to build the Instagram. I keep saying like I'm trying to
[01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:20.640]  build the Instagram, but then I never post on Instagram. So please come follow me on Instagram
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.000]  where I will never post.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.680]  And you're the same username there?
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.480]  Same, yeah.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.720]  All right. There you go. Thank you so much.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:35.760]  Thank you.
