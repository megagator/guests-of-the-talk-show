[00:00.000 --> 00:01.920]  Well, speaking of COVID, I fucking had it.
[00:02.720 --> 00:04.880]  Yeah. So how'd that go? How are you feeling now?
[00:04.880 --> 00:09.520]  I feel great now. So there we go. That's the long story short, I'm fine. And I attribute
[00:09.520 --> 00:15.120]  my, the rapidity of my recovery to being vaccinated and boosted and all that good stuff.
[00:15.120 --> 00:20.560]  But long story short, my wife got it first. She thought she had a real bad sore throat one night.
[00:20.560 --> 00:26.080]  Next day, took a test, negative. Next day, took a test, positive. Next day,
[00:26.080 --> 00:32.800]  my son and I both took a test. Jonas and I took a test. He was positive and I was still negative.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.080]  And I thought, Hey, I'm going to be the one who sails through this without getting it.
[00:36.080 --> 00:42.240]  He had, Amy had nothing but a headache, a mild headache for one night. And then ever since
[00:42.240 --> 00:46.480]  she's been sleeping like a couple hours extra, I mean, now this is like two weeks later,
[00:46.480 --> 00:51.040]  she's still sleeping more, but never really had any other symptoms other than a sore throat
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.320]  two nights before she tested positive. Jonas, the worst he ever got was some sniffles,
[00:56.320 --> 01:00.640]  blew his nose, like three, not like used up a box of tissues, but like used four tissues
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.280]  throughout the day to blow his nose. That's it. And then me, the one who tested positive last,
[01:05.280 --> 01:09.440]  I had two days where I just sort of felt there, not that good, but I still thought,
[01:10.160 --> 01:15.520]  Hey, if this is as bad as it gets, not too bad. And then two more days of the most excruciating
[01:15.520 --> 01:22.720]  sore throat I've ever had in my adult life. I had my tonsils out. I think in like third grade,
[01:22.720 --> 01:27.680]  I had repeated strep infections and I don't know what they do for kids today. I don't think they
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.560]  just, I don't think they just hack people's tonsils and adenoids out like they did in the
[01:32.560 --> 01:36.960]  early eighties and late seventies. But back then you got like two or three cases of strep in a
[01:36.960 --> 01:40.960]  year. They're like, ah, we'll just take tonsils out. That was a bad sore throat, including,
[01:40.960 --> 01:45.840]  I remember when I had the tonsillectomy, it was a pretty bad sore throat for a day or two.
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.120]  Worst part about that, as I continued to gress, I did not like ice cream when I was a kid.
[01:51.120 --> 01:51.520]  Oh no.
[01:52.160 --> 01:53.520]  Nah, I did not like ice cream.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.560]  The best thing about having stuff like that is that you get to have a bunch of ice cream.
[01:57.200 --> 02:02.000]  Yeah. I like popsicles. I did not like ice cream. And so I had popsicles, but every,
[02:02.000 --> 02:06.480]  it was like a nonstop as you're like a 10 year old getting your tonsils out there. Like,
[02:06.480 --> 02:09.840]  well, you can eat all the ice cream you want. And I was like, well, I don't like ice cream.
[02:09.840 --> 02:13.600]  Uh, now of course I eat my weight in ice cream whenever I get the chance, but,
[02:13.600 --> 02:17.840]  and including when I had this damn sore throat from COVID, it was like the only thing I could
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.640]  bear to get down. But I had two nights of just absolutely horrendous sore throat. I mean,
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.680]  just excruciating and that, that sort of sore throat that connects to a nerve to my left ear.
[02:27.680 --> 02:34.560]  So every time I swallowed, every time I swallowed and it kind of helped alleviate when I swallowed,
[02:34.560 --> 02:39.120]  if I put like my pinky finger in my left ear, like as though I was clearing out
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.680]  water from being in the pool or something. So it looked like, I don't know, like nonstop,
[02:43.680 --> 02:48.880]  like I was like a newscaster checking an earpiece like, Hey, the people in the control room tell me
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.680]  we got breaking news. I Advil helped a little with the sore throat, like made it so I could
[02:53.680 --> 03:00.320]  bear to actually like drink some water, cold, cold, cold water. Two nights of that. Oh, and
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.080]  here's the, here's the bonus point. Here's the icing on the cake. The other bad thing I had
[03:04.080 --> 03:12.080]  was nonstop phlegm in my throat that I absolutely needed to clear. And of course, clearing your
[03:12.080 --> 03:19.360]  throat of phlegm while you have an excruciating sore throat is, is like a catch 22 of symptoms.
[03:19.360 --> 03:22.880]  I wouldn't wish him to a monkey on the rock. I mean, that was, it was two days. And then the
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.520]  next day, next morning I woke up, it was all gone. Just, just like that. Snap your fingers.
[03:27.520 --> 03:34.960]  So I was curious, like, how did you, like, at this point, it's almost weird if you have never
[03:34.960 --> 03:41.440]  had it in the sense that that was us as far as we know. Right. But like, it's, it's so common now
[03:41.440 --> 03:48.400]  with, with the new the BA five and so on variants, it is just so common. I mean, I know so many
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.760]  people who have gotten it just in the last month or two and people who are fully vaccinated or,
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.840]  I mean, some of which aren't unfortunately, but I live near Long Island. So a lot of that,
[03:57.840 --> 04:01.360]  but even fully vaccinated people, they're getting it. They're just not having it bad. Like you,
[04:01.360 --> 04:05.040]  like they'll have like mild sickness. If they even notice it, they'll have a mild sickness
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.720]  for a few days and that'll be it. But it is just everywhere. Like it is. And I think this is kind
[04:10.720 --> 04:18.000]  of a preview of what I think the next few years are going to be like, where we've, we've heard
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.600]  it. We're never going to eradicate this. It's just going to become endemic and that it's going to be
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.600]  kind of like the cold and the flu where it just kind of goes around and there'll be flare ups
[04:25.600 --> 04:31.760]  here and there. And it'll just kind of go around and mutate forever. And I, I pictured that being
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.400]  a little more like the cold and the flu where you don't really ever hear about it.
[04:36.400 --> 04:40.080]  Like no one really says, yep, tested positive for the cold today. We're going to stay home
[04:40.080 --> 04:44.640]  from work for a week. Like no one treats those viruses that way. But I kind of assume that COVID
[04:44.640 --> 04:50.240]  would get there, but now I kind of think we're going to be in for a bit like a bit more of a
[04:50.240 --> 04:56.560]  severe version of that kind of like what we have now where most people have like gone back to their
[04:56.560 --> 05:02.160]  their pre COVID lifestyle, but we're still testing for it. We're still requiring tests for it for
[05:02.160 --> 05:07.040]  certain activities or events or, or conditions of work. We're still reacting a little more severely
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.280]  to it than we would any other kind of sickness. And I think, I think this is going to be the way
[05:11.280 --> 05:17.280]  it is for a while. Like not, not a few months, probably a few years at least. And maybe, I mean,
[05:17.280 --> 05:21.040]  maybe 10 years. I don't know. I mean, I don't know how this stuff usually works, but it seems
[05:21.040 --> 05:27.840]  like we are nowhere near getting a handle on it. Yeah, it's, it's, I, and again, I had lots of time
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.760]  on my hands to read, although when I was at my sickest, I couldn't even bear to like read. I
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.400]  was just, I just like laid in bed because it was so, I was so miserable. And I, I will also add,
[05:36.400 --> 05:41.360]  I'm a big baby when I get a regular cold. I think that I really do. This was a bad sore throat and
[05:41.360 --> 05:49.920]  it just, just the hellish combination of needing to go nonstop with, with, with that being
[05:49.920 --> 05:56.080]  excruciatingly painful. And again, I just woke up the next morning and it was just gone, just gone.
[05:56.080 --> 06:00.320]  Now I was, was I back to a hundred percent when I woke up? No, it's just that I had no congestion,
[06:01.040 --> 06:06.960]  no pain in my throat. The pain in my throat was gone, but like my throat felt like it had been
[06:06.960 --> 06:12.000]  ravaged. It's like when a hurricane blows through and it's horrible, horrible, horrible, and then
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.160]  it's gone. And it's like, all the trees are, all the leaves are off the trees. That was the inside
[06:16.160 --> 06:20.240]  of my throat. It was like ravaging. And I had a bit of a cough, but it wasn't like, cause I had
[06:20.240 --> 06:27.120]  to cough. It was just, I just felt like my throat had been ravaged. So I did do a lot of reading
[06:27.120 --> 06:32.160]  afterwards. I feel like, yeah. And it's like, you look at the rates, it's like the rates,
[06:32.160 --> 06:39.360]  like the hospitalization rate is up about 20% in the US with the SBA-5 goes, but the death rate
[06:39.360 --> 06:44.320]  isn't gone up at all. It sort of feels like we've worked through that. I mean, I don't mean to be
[06:44.320 --> 06:49.360]  flippant about it, but everybody's either vaccinated or if they're unvaccinated,
[06:49.360 --> 06:53.920]  they've almost certainly had it. I think there are very few unvaccinated people who,
[06:54.960 --> 07:00.240]  who are not agoraphobes who haven't had it. So there's, I don't think there's very many people
[07:00.240 --> 07:06.480]  left with no antibodies at all. And it just seems like the way these strains are mutating
[07:06.480 --> 07:12.960]  is they're mutating to get more transmissible. I mean, there's no dispute about it. BA-5 is by far
[07:12.960 --> 07:20.560]  the most contagious variant yet of an entire series of variants that are infamous for being
[07:20.560 --> 07:28.080]  from the get-go incredibly contagious, right? Like that's the whole foundation of the whole pandemic
[07:28.080 --> 07:34.560]  is that this virus is incredibly contagious. So to have a new variant that is, oh yeah, blows away
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.440]  all the contagiousness, but as it gets more contagious, it's less severe. And it seems to
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.920]  want to stick in your nose and throat because that's what works if you're vaccinated as opposed
[07:45.920 --> 07:51.440]  to getting into your lungs, which is all great news overall. But I feel like we're going to be
[07:51.440 --> 07:59.600]  in this until and if we get all new vaccines that actually target, there's endeavors over way,
[07:59.600 --> 08:05.520]  underway to develop vaccines that just blanket attack all coronaviruses, which would be fantastic
[08:06.320 --> 08:12.720]  and Omicron variant specific ones that they're working on. It seems like, as I've read,
[08:12.720 --> 08:19.280]  the downside to this is like vaccine approval takes years and years typically. And the reason
[08:19.280 --> 08:25.520]  we got the vaccines that we have that we all started getting a year ago was that they
[08:25.520 --> 08:33.120]  accelerated it because we were in an unprecedented worldwide pandemic. And it's unfortunately seems
[08:33.120 --> 08:40.480]  like the, hey, let's open up some of these bureaucratic check marks along the way of
[08:40.480 --> 08:46.400]  approving a vaccine. They're not doing that for the ones that we need the next batch. Like they're
[08:46.400 --> 08:52.560]  sort of going at the old school pace and it's sort of like, I get it. And I think that for decades,
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.000]  the approval process we had was fine. I mean, who knows, like, did our kids, your and my kids get
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.400]  like an updated measles vaccine compared to the one I got in 1974? I don't know. I mean, if they
[09:04.400 --> 09:09.920]  did and it went through a seven-year approval process, it all worked out and nobody really
[09:09.920 --> 09:15.120]  thought, hey, this measles thing is still a huge pain in the ass in the meantime. Whereas I feel
[09:15.120 --> 09:22.720]  like any and all work on COVID vaccines should all be getting, let's remove as many bureaucratic
[09:22.720 --> 09:28.320]  hurdles as possible. We want to make sure it's safe and do some sort of controlled testing to
[09:28.320 --> 09:33.040]  make sure there aren't adverse side effects. But I think until and if we get those, it's going to be
[09:33.040 --> 09:38.080]  like this going forward. Yeah. And I think ultimately this is just going to be every part
[09:38.080 --> 09:44.720]  of COVID has taken longer to work out than we originally thought when it started. Every single
[09:44.720 --> 09:52.080]  part of it. And I think this is like, now we're in this phase where everyone who has the opportunity
[09:52.080 --> 09:56.800]  to get a vaccine and the will to get a vaccine has generally gotten one now, at least one. And
[09:56.800 --> 10:01.440]  we still have a lot of the world to cover there. Most of the first world who is willing to get
[10:01.440 --> 10:07.120]  vaccinated is vaccinated. And yet we're still seeing this rip through just with fewer severe
[10:07.120 --> 10:10.320]  effects and we're getting better at treatments and things like that. So I think this is just
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.600]  going to be how it is for a while. And hopefully we'll eventually, I mean, as you mentioned,
[10:15.600 --> 10:20.800]  there are these vaccines that might target like all coronaviruses or all similar viruses in the
[10:20.800 --> 10:24.240]  family. And that would be amazing if we ever get those working and approved and safe and
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.840]  distributed. That'd be great. But until then, I don't know how imminent any of those are. Until
[10:29.840 --> 10:33.760]  then, this is just our reality for a while. I also think, I think I've mentioned this on the
[10:33.760 --> 10:39.280]  show a long time ago, I don't know, but it's just a total spitball theory on my part, but I would
[10:39.280 --> 10:46.080]  bet on it. I know that there's this whole weird, again, I don't want to get into the political
[10:46.080 --> 10:52.240]  aspect of it, amongst people who like to wear red ball caps. I'm still mad they ruined red hats. I
[10:52.240 --> 10:59.760]  used to wear red hats before 2016. I loved red hats. Before 2016, my whole color was red. My
[10:59.760 --> 11:06.720]  office was painted red. I drive a red car. I loved red everything. That was like my color for
[11:06.720 --> 11:11.680]  everything. And I feel kind of, now I feel like I kind of can't do that. Like I've been transitioning
[11:11.680 --> 11:15.520]  over to blue. You got to fight back. Because I live in a city where everybody who loves the
[11:15.520 --> 11:20.480]  baseball team wears a red cap. So everybody, Philly, St. Louis, teams places where the
[11:20.480 --> 11:25.200]  ball clubs wear red baseball caps. I mean, we can, we can, we can take red caps back. But,
[11:25.200 --> 11:32.640]  but the politics of vaccine resistance aside, I sincerely think that it doesn't show up in polls
[11:32.640 --> 11:38.800]  because the people who this, this is true about don't want to admit it even anonymously to a
[11:38.800 --> 11:44.240]  pollster. But I think that there are a surprising number of adults who really don't like needles.
[11:44.800 --> 11:53.440]  And, and I think, I think evolutionarily that is actually a completely understandable,
[11:53.440 --> 12:03.040]  downright phobia because throughout the history of mankind, up until literally like one generation
[12:03.040 --> 12:09.040]  ago when antibiotics were invented, having your skin punctured was a very good way to get an
[12:09.040 --> 12:17.200]  infection that would kill you. And so having a profound fear of any puncture to your skin,
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.680]  even with a hypodermic needle, which often doesn't, like, I've gotten what, a bunch of
[12:23.680 --> 12:28.080]  these shots and boosters. I don't, I don't even think I ever bled. And I was a kid, I had to,
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.000]  did you have allergy shots? I know you had allergies. I sure did. I even had allergy shots
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.960]  as an adult just a few years ago. I, I, when I was a kid, I had to get allergy shots every Saturday
[12:36.960 --> 12:42.720]  for a while. And then it was like every two weeks. So I've had like, seriously, I was a Wednesday
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.560]  kid. Yeah, no exaggeration. Well, I, I was, Hey, what's a better way to spend your Saturday morning
[12:49.440 --> 12:54.480]  going out to the pediatrician and getting two allergy shots, one in each arm. And it's like,
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.720]  and I always knew one of them made my arm hurt and the other one didn't. And if I was playing sports,
[12:58.720 --> 13:03.360]  I would kind of try to get the, the one that hurt in my right arm, even if I was due, I mean,
[13:03.360 --> 13:06.800]  in my left arm, cause I'm right handed. Yeah. You've ruined your non-dominant arm with the
[13:06.800 --> 13:14.720]  allergy shot. So I've, I've literally had hundreds of shots in my lifetime. And when you get allergy
[13:14.720 --> 13:19.600]  shots every Saturday morning, you quickly lose any sort of, you might as well be sticking it into
[13:20.480 --> 13:24.480]  an orange or something like they do when they're training nurses, how to give shots. It doesn't,
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.320]  doesn't bother me at all, but I totally understand why people have a phobia about it. It's
[13:28.320 --> 13:33.600]  it is evolutionarily, it is totally natural to be like, screw that. I don't want my skin punctured.
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.760]  I hate it. So I think, and where I'm going with this is there's, they are doing accelerated work
[13:39.760 --> 13:44.320]  on getting nasal vaccines where you just, it's just like taking no spray. You just shoot, shoot
[13:44.320 --> 13:50.240]  right up your nostrils. And I think amongst the as yet unvaccinated, I think that could be a huge
[13:50.240 --> 13:54.400]  boost. I really do. That's interesting. Yeah. Cause I, I think if you go back to what our friend
[13:54.400 --> 13:59.680]  Merlin has said a number of times on podcasts, that if you, if you don't know why someone is,
[13:59.680 --> 14:05.040]  is doing something or you know what, not doing something, oftentimes the answer is either fear
[14:05.040 --> 14:09.440]  or money or both. Cause those are things that people often don't want to talk about or even
[14:09.440 --> 14:14.240]  don't want to admit to themselves might be the reason that's it's often fear or, or usually a
[14:14.240 --> 14:20.160]  lack of money. And in the case of anti-vaccine sentiment, I think a ton of that is the fear of
[14:20.160 --> 14:25.280]  getting shots because most adults don't routinely get shots and haven't gotten a shot in a long
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.280]  time. And so the idea of it, and when you're a kid, you're kind of forced to by your parents,
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.040]  when once you're an adult, you don't really have to unless something, unless you have some health
[14:33.040 --> 14:36.160]  thing that requires it. But for the most part, you don't usually have to get shots. And so
[14:37.200 --> 14:44.320]  so much of it is just the fear. And when somebody has a fear and something provides them an out of
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.800]  some political ideologies, whatever it is, when, when they're provided with an out, they'll take
[14:48.800 --> 14:56.160]  it. So all those people who were just afraid of getting a shot, when their politics tell them,
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.240]  Oh, this is bad. You don't have to do this. You shouldn't do this. It's, it's not what our tribe
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.960]  does or whatever. They will take that answer and they'll, then they'll run with it. And you will
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.280]  not win against that. Anyway, that's a long, anyway, I'm happy to talk about it. And anybody
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.960]  has questions, you can feel free to hit me up. I'll tell you what I know. I haven't gone through
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.040]  it, but it put a real kink in my intended podcasting schedule because the other side
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.960]  effect of coming out of it was I, I had no voice done from my ravaged throat. I did dithering last
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.840]  week. And the first time we did it, I mean, it was like, I think we recorded about 16 minutes to get
[15:29.840 --> 15:35.920]  15 minutes to put out there. And when we were done, it was, it was like, my throat felt like
[15:35.920 --> 15:40.640]  I had finished a marathon. It felt like I had finished like an episode of this show. There was
[15:40.640 --> 15:45.280]  no way I could do this show until this week. So sorry for the lack of talk shows, although I
[15:45.280 --> 15:48.960]  usually don't have to apologize for that here. Let me take a first break and thank our first sponsor.
[15:48.960 --> 15:55.040]  It's a brand new sponsor, which always excites me. ShipStation. When you run a business, time
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.600]  seems more precious. Every misplaced moment feels like a missed opportunity, a lost chance to make
[15:59.600 --> 16:05.840]  your business better, or even just step away and recharge, relax. ShipStation gives e-commerce
[16:05.840 --> 16:12.000]  sellers more time to do what they really love, unless what you really love is managing every
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.160]  single little detail of order fulfillment, which is probably nobody. ShipStation automates time
[16:18.160 --> 16:24.240]  intensive shipping processes. So you, if you're an e-commerce seller, can get back to focusing
[16:24.240 --> 16:29.440]  on bigger, better, more fun things like developing new products or honing your marketing or just
[16:29.440 --> 16:35.680]  watching TV or whatever you want to do. No wonder ShipStation is already trusted by over 100,000
[16:35.680 --> 16:43.840]  sellers. It works with all storefronts, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, more, and it lets you automate all
[16:43.840 --> 16:49.760]  the manual work that goes into shipping. You also get deeply discounted shipping rates, the type of
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.760]  shipping rates that are normally reserved for Fortune 500 companies. You get them too, as a
[16:55.760 --> 17:02.880]  small seller, because you're getting the benefits of the rate that ShipStation gets. And you can
[17:02.880 --> 17:08.240]  easily compare carriers for shipping, the rates, delivery time, so it's easy to choose the best
[17:08.240 --> 17:14.160]  option for every shipping scenario. Here's a great stat. Like our friend Tim Cook loves customer
[17:14.160 --> 17:21.920]  satisfaction. Look at this stat. 98% of companies that use ShipStation for a year keep using it as
[17:21.920 --> 17:27.280]  long as they're in business. That's unbelievable. 98%. So here's what you do. It's time to let go

[18:03.600 --> 18:09.440]  We've got new products to talk about. We sure do. I want to talk the first and the one that
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.040]  everybody's waiting to hear about, so I want to get it over with first so we can spend as much
[18:13.040 --> 18:20.960]  time as possible. Hop water? Hop water. Really? I've got two cans of it right here. Me too.
[18:20.960 --> 18:24.320]  Proud of me. This is a product.
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.360]  While I was at Casa del Armed, you introduced me to a competing product. What's it called? Hop lark,
[18:37.360 --> 18:43.760]  right? Yeah, it's basically hop-flavored seltzer. So it tastes kind of like beer,
[18:43.760 --> 18:48.320]  but is non-alcoholic and is otherwise just no calories, no alcohol. It's flavored seltzer,
[18:48.320 --> 18:52.880]  like many of our other flavored seltzer things we're fans of, like Hal's, but the flavor is
[18:52.880 --> 18:56.080]  hops, which is what makes beer bitter, and so it tastes kind of like an IPA.
[18:57.040 --> 18:59.120]  Or it has like... Vaguely.
[19:00.400 --> 19:06.960]  It's like a hint of it, a suggestion of it, like, oh, if you like beer, you might like this seltzer
[19:06.960 --> 19:12.960]  water. It is not non-alcoholic beer, right? That's made with greens and stuff still.
[19:12.960 --> 19:21.200]  Yeah, and of those non-alcoholic beers, I'm actually... I have another growing,
[19:21.200 --> 19:28.000]  not addiction, because it's non-alcoholic, but a growing habit of the Heineken Zero. They call it
[19:28.000 --> 19:35.520]  Heineken 0.0. It is 0% alcohol Heineken. Tastes like a regular Heineken, which is not my favorite
[19:35.520 --> 19:40.960]  type of beer, but it's kind of uncanny how it tastes like a Heineken. But that stuff has like
[19:40.960 --> 19:45.600]  69 calories, 70 calories, or something like that, because they make it like beer, and it tastes,
[19:45.600 --> 19:50.640]  it's supposed to taste like a beer, but it just doesn't have alcohol. Hop water and hop lark,
[19:50.640 --> 19:56.080]  but this stuff hop water, which you turned me on to, I have to agree, it's better than the hop lark.
[19:56.080 --> 20:01.520]  This is a superior tasting product. It does not taste like non-alcoholic beer. It tastes
[20:01.520 --> 20:08.880]  like seltzer water infused with hops, so it's like, if you just like Heineken Pilsner style
[20:08.880 --> 20:13.760]  beer and you don't like IPAs, you're definitely not gonna like hop water. You gotta like the
[20:13.760 --> 20:17.680]  overhopped hoppy beers. But it doesn't taste like... I don't know how to explain it. It is
[20:18.480 --> 20:24.320]  very difficult to explain. Yeah, it just tastes like flavored seltzer, flavored like hops,
[20:24.320 --> 20:29.120]  which is something that most people will probably find very strange. But if you happen to like
[20:29.120 --> 20:35.600]  flavored seltzer and you happen to like beer, it's pretty good. Now, my wife, Amy, she does not care
[20:35.600 --> 20:41.600]  for hoppy beers, has never cared for them. I let her have a sip of a hop water. She said it tastes
[20:42.240 --> 20:49.680]  like licking the tray on an airplane. Has she frequently done this? No, I immediately asked,
[20:49.680 --> 20:54.320]  and she said, well, it tastes how I imagine it would taste to lick the tray. It's the obvious
[20:54.320 --> 21:02.800]  retort. Like some kind of industrial strength sanitizing cleanser that they hurriedly wipe
[21:02.800 --> 21:09.280]  a wipe on the tray in the five minutes between allowing the old passengers to get off and the
[21:09.280 --> 21:13.440]  new passengers on. So she's not a fan, but man, I love this stuff. And they've got a couple of
[21:13.440 --> 21:19.680]  different flavors. I think my favorite is just their classic. It's just hop infused seltzer water.
[21:20.640 --> 21:23.840]  I will say like the reason I started going for this stuff is I wanted to like still have some
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.080]  beer flavors that I like so much, but I haven't been drinking as much because I'm getting older
[21:28.080 --> 21:34.640]  and the hangovers hit me worse to the point where like now if I have two beers at dinner one night,
[21:34.640 --> 21:39.440]  the next morning I'll feel more tired. I'll feel like a little bit worse even with just that.
[21:39.440 --> 21:44.320]  And so I've been trying to cut back and this is nice. The one thing about this is kind of odd
[21:44.320 --> 21:49.680]  though is that because it still tastes like something from the beer family, it still feels
[21:49.680 --> 21:56.560]  something I should only have like at night. Like it would feel wrong to have this with lunch for
[21:56.560 --> 22:06.240]  some reason. I have the exact same psychological reluctance to drink it before five. Yeah,
[22:07.760 --> 22:11.600]  like if I'm like going to go to my computer to get some coding work done, I would not grab one
[22:11.600 --> 22:15.680]  of these even though like I'll grab, you know, it's like a house black cherry or something,
[22:15.680 --> 22:19.520]  even though like there's no there's no difference. There's no reason why I shouldn't grab this.
[22:19.520 --> 22:24.880]  I feel the same way. It's just a psychological. It's just an association between it's funny
[22:24.880 --> 22:30.080]  because it's obviously doesn't taste like alcohol. It's it's because there is none. It's it's a hop
[22:30.080 --> 22:38.080]  type thing and I've never had hop type tastes anything on the spectrum other than drinking
[22:38.880 --> 22:43.920]  beer. And so I just have this association of a wait. I want to I'm hoping to get a lot of work
[22:43.920 --> 22:48.160]  done this afternoon, but I shouldn't be shouldn't be drinking this stuff. I'll just have a house
[22:48.160 --> 22:55.120]  fizzy water. Anyway, this stuff is fantastic and they spell it h o p w t r hop water. I've
[22:55.120 --> 22:58.720]  only ever found it on Amazon. I haven't found it in stores yet. And it's when you get it from
[22:58.720 --> 23:05.840]  Amazon, of course, they they put it in basically a paper bag. And so it comes like the thinnest box
[23:05.840 --> 23:11.600]  possible. So you get it. It's so beaten up. But so and every can I've gotten so far has been at
[23:11.600 --> 23:16.560]  least slightly dented because it's all Amazon. But it's has survived so far. They haven't had
[23:16.560 --> 23:22.640]  any ruptures yet. We'll see my corner bodega where I buy actual beer. And I was there just
[23:22.640 --> 23:27.520]  the other day and I bought a six pack of the of the Heineken zero. I mentioned it. I'm like a
[23:27.520 --> 23:32.960]  regular there. I mentioned it to the guy because I was buying the Heineken zero. And he was like,
[23:32.960 --> 23:37.280]  Oh, you should try this other stuff. And he pointed to it. And it was hop water. They have it.
[23:37.280 --> 23:40.240]  Oh, yeah, well, right at my corner store. I don't even have to cross the street.
[23:42.080 --> 23:46.400]  Anyway, I'm giving a big thumbs up to that. That's my product recommendation today. I
[23:46.400 --> 23:48.800]  don't think I have it. Do we have any other products to talk about?
[23:49.440 --> 23:52.320]  I don't think I mean, we usually talk about computers. But have there been any
[23:52.320 --> 23:57.440]  recent computers that are running? You know what I actually do, though, I want to tell you a tech
[23:57.440 --> 24:04.160]  support story. Before we get to the MacBook Air, which you have you do I didn't I should
[24:04.160 --> 24:08.400]  have got it right here. I should have checked before. Before we recorded. Yeah, I have it
[24:08.400 --> 24:12.480]  right here sitting on top of my my 14 inch MacBook Pro, which I have for comparison.
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.560]  But you know, I've because because my schedule with COVID threw off my schedule. I've got
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.520]  more sponsors than usual for this show. So let me talk toss one in here tossing
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.240]  was hot water not one hot water was not a sponsorship. That was a completely
[24:28.880 --> 24:33.280]  serendipitous I just because you're the one who introduced me to this whole category.
[24:33.280 --> 24:38.720]  But speaking of beverages that I'm addicted to, I want to tell you about trade coffee.
[24:38.720 --> 24:45.680]  Look, trade coffee is you subscribe, they send you fresh beans from local roasters
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.320]  all around the country to your house. But here's the thing. They have all sorts of coffees to
[24:50.320 --> 24:55.920]  choose from. I forget how many it's just dozens and maybe like 100 different coffees. Sounds
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.200]  crazy. How are you going to choose? What you do is you go to a drink trade. That's their website,
[25:01.200 --> 25:07.280]  drink trade.com slash the talk show. And they have a quiz and the quiz takes like a minute
[25:07.280 --> 25:12.560]  like a minute and a half, maybe less. They just sort of ask you what type of coffees you like.
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.480]  And you answer a couple questions and then they make some recommendations and then they send you
[25:16.480 --> 25:21.440]  coffee. That's going to be what you like. I did this. I did the I did the quiz. They sent me
[25:21.440 --> 25:26.320]  coffee. I like the coffee they sent me and I'm kind of picky about coffee work pretty well for
[25:26.320 --> 25:30.240]  me. But they've got like a guarantee if they send you coffee and you don't like it. You can you can
[25:30.240 --> 25:36.320]  get go back and talk to a chat with a consultant at trade and they'll they'll send you another
[25:36.320 --> 25:39.680]  batch of different coffee just to get you something you like here. Here I'm looking
[25:39.680 --> 25:45.360]  at the talking point that they they've personally taste tested over 450 roasts. So these guys,
[25:45.360 --> 25:51.040]  they have a lot of stuff to choose from. But what they do is they get you freshly roasted beans
[25:51.040 --> 25:58.640]  from 60 of the country's best craft roasters, small businesses who pay farmers, coffee farmers
[25:58.640 --> 26:03.760]  fair prices to sustainably source the greatest beans from around the world. And the truth is,
[26:03.760 --> 26:09.760]  and I know Marco, you're going to agree with me. Coffee is a perishable item. As soon as it's
[26:09.760 --> 26:15.200]  roasted, it starts going bad. If you're buying stuff off the shelf at like a supermarket or
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.400]  something like that, it's probably already half bad. It really is. It makes a huge difference.
[26:21.440 --> 26:26.400]  What trade does is they roast it and as soon as it's roasted, they seal it up, send it to you and
[26:26.400 --> 26:32.560]  you get it like two days later, something like that. Very quick, very fresh. And then you just
[26:32.560 --> 26:38.720]  drink it right away. And when you subscribe, you have so much flexibility on how frequently you
[26:38.720 --> 26:42.480]  want more coffee to come. Do you want it every week? Do you want it every 10 days? Do you want
[26:42.480 --> 26:46.880]  it every two weeks? Do you just want it once a month? Do you need more? Are you trying to get
[26:46.880 --> 26:52.160]  coffee for a whole office? Get get tons of it every week, whatever you want, you can get it
[26:53.200 --> 27:01.360]  to really good coffee from really good roasters, really fresh sent to you. It is a really good
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.320]  product. I recommend it. It's really good. I've drunk too much of it today, for sure.
[27:06.320 --> 27:14.560]  Here's the deal. They are offering new subscribers a total of $30 off your first order plus free
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.920]  shipping. When you go to DrinkTrade.com slash the talk show, that's more than 40 cups of coffee
[27:19.920 --> 27:25.680]  for free. So you can get started by taking that quiz I told you about it. DrinkTrade.com slash
[27:25.680 --> 27:32.800]  the talk show. Let trade find you a coffee you love. That's DrinkTrade.com slash the talk show.
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.960]  Get 30 bucks off. All right. Here's my story before we get to the MacBook Air.
[27:38.960 --> 27:45.760]  So on April 14th, I'm keenly aware now of all these dates after after having spent quite some
[27:45.760 --> 27:51.040]  time on the phone today. April 14th, I ordered a studio display with nano texture glass and an
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.840]  adjustable stand. Oh, yeah. And it did not it was not set to her. It did not arrive late.
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.840]  But it was not set to arrive until I forget what the window was. But it was like pretty much the
[28:03.840 --> 28:10.160]  month of June and it did not arrive until the end of June. But we my family went on vacation at the
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.360]  very beginning of July. And so I didn't set it up before we went on vacation. I waited till after.
[28:15.360 --> 28:22.400]  And then I came home and I had COVID and I just didn't feel like doing it. And I didn't set it
[28:22.400 --> 28:32.400]  up until today and took it out of the box and put it on my desk. And I love it before I've even
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.640]  turned it on, because it's I still set it up. It was sunny after a really sunny afternoon.
[28:37.360 --> 28:43.360]  And the I still have the review unit of the regular studio display, which I moved aside,
[28:43.360 --> 28:49.040]  and I put this nanotexture one there. And I really just keenly observed with without the display on
[28:49.040 --> 28:55.520]  just black, how much reflection was on the regular one. And then how much was on the nanotexture,
[28:55.520 --> 29:01.280]  which was not none. But it's not it's almost it's so diffuse. It's not a reflection like
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.720]  I can't see my own self. There's no mirrorness to it. Like it's like, Oh, this is going to be
[29:06.720 --> 29:11.520]  just what the doctor ordered for me. I plug in the power and I get those three little dots. Do
[29:11.520 --> 29:17.280]  you have a studio display yet? No. All right. So when you plug in the studio display, because you
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.320]  know how it's an iOS, I know it has to boot up, right? Yeah, it has to boot and it's an iOS
[29:22.320 --> 29:28.160]  computer. So what it does is as soon as it gets power, the screen comes on. It's still black,
[29:28.160 --> 29:33.840]  but you can tell it's on because it's no longer the richest, inkiest black, black of an off
[29:33.840 --> 29:40.080]  display. It is now a display that is powered on showing black, but they have three dots and they
[29:40.080 --> 29:44.720]  and they animate a little bit like one, two, three, one, two, three. When I plugged in my
[29:44.720 --> 29:49.280]  review unit originally, I wasn't paying attention. I was like, because I have to go under my desk to
[29:49.280 --> 29:53.440]  plug it in and I'm plugging it in and I wasn't really looking and I wasn't thinking about it.
[29:53.440 --> 29:58.080]  And I missed the whole thing when I plugged the first one in. But then I've since had to unplug
[29:58.080 --> 30:02.000]  and replug it a few times because that's, it's the only way to restart the thing.
[30:02.640 --> 30:08.960]  And I still can't believe like, this is the idea of you have a monitor that you have to occasionally
[30:08.960 --> 30:16.080]  reboot. I still can't get behind that. I'm okay with that. I am okay. I am okay with it. What I'm
[30:16.080 --> 30:22.320]  not okay with is that the only way to reboot it is to literally yank the plug out of the power,
[30:23.120 --> 30:27.440]  which I think for most people naturally is going to be under their desk, which I don't think
[30:27.440 --> 30:34.320]  anybody should ever have to do. And as, as I'm becoming older, it just feels more beneath me.
[30:34.320 --> 30:39.440]  I'm not as flexible as I used to be. You know, like when I was in college and I got jobs as a
[30:39.440 --> 30:44.320]  young kid who knows how to deal with computers, I spent half my day under desks, right? You're
[30:44.320 --> 30:50.080]  always down there plugging ethernet cables and this and that. Yeah, all the time. Half your day,
[30:50.080 --> 30:54.400]  half your workday is underneath that. It's just what you do when you're 23 years old and you're
[30:54.400 --> 30:58.880]  good with computers. You're climbing under desks and stuff like that. When you're 49,
[30:58.880 --> 31:04.160]  it's not so fun. And if they just had a goddamn button, just a button, something that make it a
[31:04.160 --> 31:09.440]  long press, even what, if you really want to make it one of those little pinhole buttons that you
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.880]  have to stick like a SIM card ejector or a paperclip in, and that's how you restart it.
[31:15.520 --> 31:21.600]  But something, something so that you could restart the damn thing without yanking the power out,
[31:21.600 --> 31:28.880]  which honestly feels wrong, right? Everything that I've ever learned about computers that
[31:28.880 --> 31:33.920]  don't have batteries is that you shouldn't just yank the power out, but that's, you can like,
[31:33.920 --> 31:38.400]  look at Apple dot support dot apple.com, how to restart a studio display. And they're like,
[31:38.400 --> 31:43.120]  they, they don't, I was going to lie. It's a lie. They don't say yank the power out,
[31:44.240 --> 31:49.280]  but they do say remove it from power. Anyway, I plugged this new one in. I get the three dots,
[31:49.280 --> 31:54.000]  but they only, they're only up there like two or three seconds. And then it's black again.
[31:54.000 --> 32:01.280]  And then I, I connect my Mac book pro and it, the display doesn't turn on and it's just black.
[32:01.280 --> 32:04.240]  And I thought, damn, I thought when I hooked the other one up, as soon as I plugged in the
[32:04.240 --> 32:09.760]  Thunderbolt cable, it just came on. I'm like, what the hell do I do? And if there, and I'm,
[32:09.760 --> 32:13.040]  and I was thinking the same discussion, but there's, there are no buttons, right? It's
[32:13.040 --> 32:17.360]  not like the brightness is too low. There's no brightness button on the side that, that I,
[32:17.360 --> 32:23.920]  that I was like shipped from the factory at zero. And I'm sitting there like, what the hell do I do?
[32:23.920 --> 32:31.280]  And I unplugged the Thunderbolt cable, plugged it back in, didn't come on. I, I took the
[32:31.280 --> 32:36.960]  Thunderbolt cable around, out, flipped it around, put, put the side that was in the display into
[32:36.960 --> 32:41.440]  the Mac book and the side that was in the Mac book into the display. And it didn't turn on.
[32:41.440 --> 32:46.080]  And I'm like, what the hell did I do the last time? This is weird. I, I, I should be able to figure
[32:46.080 --> 32:51.600]  this out. And, and I'm thinking like, am I still like clouded in the head from COVID? And I'm like,
[32:51.600 --> 32:56.480]  I don't think so. I wrote a good, I think a good article about the Mac book air last week. I'm not
[32:56.480 --> 33:03.200]  stupid, but I, then I took, I took the paperwork out, the, the getting started and I'm like,
[33:03.200 --> 33:06.960]  there's gotta be something stupid. I'm not thinking of like the most obvious thing in
[33:06.960 --> 33:11.520]  the world. And I look at it and it just says, plug it into power, plug it into your Mac,
[33:11.520 --> 33:16.880]  and it'll just turn on. I'm like, what the hell is going on? And I saw the three dots.
[33:16.880 --> 33:24.480]  It definitely was on. And then I thought, well, let me, I did something to make a noise on my Mac
[33:24.480 --> 33:29.840]  and it played through the studio display speakers. And I went to system preferences,
[33:29.840 --> 33:36.240]  displays, and it had nothing but the built-in Mac book pro display. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[33:36.240 --> 33:42.720]  display. No, no, it didn't see the studio display, but I went to sound and it sound was set to studio
[33:42.720 --> 33:49.600]  display speakers. So I opened up FaceTime and I went to the menu. I forget what it's called,
[33:49.600 --> 33:56.320]  but you can choose which camera to use. And I, I chose studio display camera and I got the,
[33:56.320 --> 34:03.200]  the wonderfully crisp high resolution image of the studio display camera
[34:03.200 --> 34:09.040]  and the green light to show that the camera was in use came on. So the webcam worked,
[34:09.040 --> 34:15.280]  the speakers were playing my audio, but there was no picture. And I thought, what the hell
[34:15.280 --> 34:21.280]  is going on? So under the desk, I went, pulled, yanked, that's the technical term, yanked the
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.600]  power out of the wall, waited a little bit, plugged it back in, same thing, no difference.
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.040]  I, I thought, son of a bitch, I got a, I got a lemon, right? I mean, I got a,
[34:33.040 --> 34:38.640]  I got a bad studio display, which is a pain in the ass and just, it's been so long since
[34:38.640 --> 34:43.680]  I've gotten a lemon product from Apple. I mean, seriously, like decades. I, I, in fact,
[34:43.680 --> 34:49.440]  I can't even remember. I don't think I've ever gotten a significant problem product from Apple
[34:49.440 --> 34:54.080]  that was a lemon or even an insignificant one. Now that I'm talking about it here,
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.600]  I can't remember ever buying a single thing and I've, shocker here, I've bought a lot of products
[34:59.600 --> 35:05.120]  from Apple and further, oh, I did get a lemon once. The one and only lemon I've ever gotten
[35:05.120 --> 35:13.600]  from Apple, one and only, was my first Series Zero Apple Watch review unit. Do you remember this?
[35:13.600 --> 35:16.800]  I think I wrote about it. Yeah, yeah. He had the bad Taptic engine, right? Yeah, it had a bad Taptic
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.280]  engine. It was like really, really weak. And I thought, this is weird. I don't know. I don't
[35:21.280 --> 35:29.200]  know. When I, when I was at, when I was at the event, it was much stronger. And then as the day,
[35:29.200 --> 35:34.320]  like the hour went on, it got weaker and weaker. And by like an hour into it, it didn't tap at all.
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.520]  And I contacted Apple and they sent someone like a courier over with a replacement and it was fine.
[35:39.520 --> 35:42.720]  So that's the one time I ever got a lemon from Apple. Well, I didn't even pay for it.
[35:43.520 --> 35:49.440]  And somebody from Apple came in an hour later to my door, rang the doorbell with a replacement
[35:49.440 --> 35:55.600]  because it was a review unit. But I thought, son of a bitch, this expensive display,
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.240]  which is going to be such a pain in the ass to send back. What am I getting? I'm thinking like,
[36:00.240 --> 36:05.360]  what am I going to do? Do I ship it back? Do I, do I run it to the Apple store here in Philadelphia?
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.000]  But I, and then I thought, ah, Jesus Christ, it took three months for this thing to show up
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.680]  or two months, right? Felt like three. I'm going to have to wait another couple of months for the
[36:13.680 --> 36:20.240]  replacement. And of course, poor, poor me. Oh, poor John Gruber. I've got the review unit studio
[36:20.240 --> 36:26.480]  display. And it's still on my desk. I was smart enough not to have packaged it back up to send
[36:26.480 --> 36:32.560]  yet, right? Cause I thought I'd like to have it side by side to compare the reflective display
[36:32.560 --> 36:38.560]  versus non-reflective. So poor, poor me, I was going to have to suffer and keep my review unit
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.800]  for another two months while the thing, but I was so looking forward to having the nanotexture
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.760]  cause my office is so filled with sun and it really is like the perfect scenario for
[36:48.320 --> 36:53.280]  a matte style finished display. But it's just like, what a pain in the ass. What a, what a
[36:53.280 --> 36:58.240]  run of bad luck. But then I thought, what if it's the cable? What if it's the Thunderbolt cable?
[36:59.120 --> 37:06.080]  So I took the Thunderbolt cable, the Apple one from the review unit display, use that cable.
[37:06.080 --> 37:12.320]  Second, I plugged it in, the display turned on. Huh? Second, it instantly just worked exactly as
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.560]  I thought it was going to work all along. I took the cable that I just opened today,
[37:17.360 --> 37:20.640]  plugged it into my review unit, which I've been using for months,
[37:20.640 --> 37:26.960]  plug that into my Mac book. And it was the same story. No picture at all. Sound work video worked.
[37:27.760 --> 37:31.440]  They said this was the cable that came with it, came with the, came with it. So you did get a
[37:31.440 --> 37:37.280]  lemon. You got a lemon Thunderbolt. I got a lemon Thunderbolt cable. Oh wow. So I didn't know what,
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.880]  what do I do about that? Now, if it was like a, you know, like a lightning cable or something
[37:40.880 --> 37:44.480]  like that, I'd just throw it in the garbage and buy a new one. But these, these are,
[37:45.280 --> 37:50.240]  he was like $400. These are like shockingly expensive cables. Although I went to their
[37:50.240 --> 37:55.360]  website. So what they ship it, and for those who don't know, it is a black Thunderbolt. I think
[37:55.360 --> 38:00.640]  it's a Thunderbolt four cable. I don't, yeah, I think Thunderbolt three and four cables are the
[38:00.640 --> 38:06.400]  same. I'm not positive on that. I think four just means that it's also guaranteed to also carry USB
[38:06.400 --> 38:12.080]  at maximum speed, but I could be wrong about that detail, but yeah, part of the joy of the entire
[38:12.080 --> 38:21.520]  universe of, of cables that look like quote unquote USB-C if it looks like USB-C on the end.
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.840]  Oh boy. Glenn Fleishman has written like a 700 page book explaining all of these cables and
[38:27.840 --> 38:35.040]  he's a concise writer who's who, who duplicated no information. But yeah, I don't know if a
[38:35.040 --> 38:39.440]  Thunderbolt three USB-C cable is actually different from Thunderbolt four. But anyway,
[38:39.440 --> 38:44.960]  if you go to Apple's website, it seems, I don't know if they're out of stock or what, but the one
[38:44.960 --> 38:51.680]  that ships with the studio display is one meter, which sounds, that sounds long enough. In real
[38:51.680 --> 38:58.480]  life is not quite that long. If you really want, depending on where you want to set up your Mac
[38:58.480 --> 39:05.360]  compared to the studio display, it's for me using a MacBook Pro with it, it's kind of tight where I
[39:05.360 --> 39:10.720]  like to set my MacBook Pro up next to the studio display. I typically run it with the MacBook
[39:10.720 --> 39:16.960]  closed. I don't like having a little tiny MacBook display and a big standalone display. If I have
[39:16.960 --> 39:22.960]  two displays, I want them to be the exact same size. That's just me. But the way I run my MacBook
[39:22.960 --> 39:28.800]  closed, the one meter, it's not stretched. It's just luckily if it were 0.8 meters instead of
[39:28.800 --> 39:33.280]  one meter, it would be too short for me. But they don't seem to sell this one meter cable. So I
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.440]  don't know how much it would cost to buy a new one. If you go to apple.com, it seems like the
[39:37.440 --> 39:44.560]  only ones they sell are 1.8 meters and three meters. And the 1.8 meter cable is 130 bucks
[39:44.560 --> 39:51.680]  and the three meter one is like 170 or something like that, or 160. Expensive cables. So I got on
[39:51.680 --> 39:58.080]  the phone and I haven't spoken to Apple because because I haven't had a lemon, I haven't spoken
[39:58.080 --> 40:03.840]  to like 1-800-APPLE or whatever the hell the number is in years, years and years and years.
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.920]  But I talked to some very nice people there. How long was I on the phone? 31 minutes. No,
[40:09.920 --> 40:14.720]  that's not bad. They answered the phone very quickly. And it's like they somehow because I
[40:14.720 --> 40:19.440]  called from my iPhone, they recognize the number and then they sent like an alert to all my devices
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.960]  to confirm it's me. And then they could look up my order details and stuff. I was unfortunately,
[40:24.960 --> 40:31.840]  most of my time was on hold when I explained my problem to the woman who answered. I actually,
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.680]  I think I did a more concise version than I just did talking here on the show, but explained that
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.160]  I have another studio display. I just bought one. I just opened it where I bought it in April,
[40:42.160 --> 40:49.040]  just opened it. The new cable, no picture, but sound works, webcam works. I happen to have
[40:49.040 --> 40:54.320]  another studio display. That's all I said. That one's cable, everything works with the new display.
[40:54.320 --> 41:00.160]  So I'm 99% sure that it's a bum cable. And then she asked the very insightful question,
[41:00.160 --> 41:06.480]  did I try the new cable on the old studio display? And I said, yes, I did. And it was the same
[41:06.480 --> 41:11.440]  problem. No picture, even though sound worked and the webcam worked. And she said, okay,
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.520]  sounds like we need to send you a new cable. Let me put you on hold. I'll get somebody else.
[41:15.520 --> 41:19.840]  That's where I had to wait. Like, I don't know. I spent like two minutes talking to her,
[41:19.840 --> 41:24.880]  25 minutes on hold. And then I got to talk to somebody else who agreed to send me a new cable
[41:24.880 --> 41:33.520]  in two days. So we'll see how that goes. Well, best of luck. I will say like, if you like the,
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.520]  the Thunderbolt four cables that are on the market, there aren't many of them. My preferred
[41:37.520 --> 41:45.760]  one is the Cal digit one, which sells, it sells for $30 for a one meter one or $75 for a two meter
[41:45.760 --> 41:52.880]  one, but it did a Thunderbolt four cable. And what that means is you plug it into any USB-C
[41:52.880 --> 41:57.920]  hole and you plug the other end into any other USB-C hole and it will do what you want it to do.
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.560]  It supports all the power, all the data transfer, Thunderbolt and USB modes at full speed on both.
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.320]  The only downside is it is a very expensive cable, but if you want all of your problems solved with
[42:10.320 --> 42:15.040]  the Thunderbolt cables, you can get these Thunderbolt four certified cables. Again,
[42:15.040 --> 42:19.280]  my favorite is the Cal digit ones. OWC also makes one that I think is just as good. And
[42:19.280 --> 42:22.000]  they're all about the same price. They look about the same. They're a little bit thick. They're not
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.440]  super flexible because there's a whole bunch of cables in there, but they are, they will solve
[42:25.440 --> 42:33.520]  your problem if you just burn money. I happen to have at least one other true Thunderbolt.
[42:33.520 --> 42:39.920]  I don't even, again, I guess, no, the other one I have is I think from Monoprice, it's black.
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.880]  I bought it for use doing like migration assistant, which we can get to in a minute as I talk about
[42:46.880 --> 42:51.280]  setting up the MacBook Air. But because that's what I knew I wanted to use it for, I bought the
[42:51.280 --> 42:58.880]  short one, which again, it saves you a lot of money. But my Monoprice one has the little lightning
[42:58.880 --> 43:05.600]  logo on it. But it also says three. So that it sort of speaks to the idea that a Thunderbolt
[43:05.600 --> 43:10.640]  three cable still can do everything. And for the purposes of connecting an Apple display,
[43:10.640 --> 43:14.320]  I think that's all you need. Like I know, I know what the XDR I mean, it's XDR is a little bit
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.240]  different in the sense that the studio display has all these USB, I think I assume it's us,
[43:18.240 --> 43:22.960]  but these these devices in it, that like the camera, the microphones and all that stuff,
[43:22.960 --> 43:28.400]  whereas the XDR, the only reason it has USB is for the up the USB ports on the back. So I think
[43:28.400 --> 43:32.640]  it might be a little bit different, but I could be wrong. But I can tell you the XDR works fine
[43:32.640 --> 43:36.880]  with any Thunderbolt three cable. But if you happen to have a four, the four is what guarantees
[43:36.880 --> 43:42.880]  that will also have the full speed for USB transfers and USB mode, I think. Well, I tried
[43:42.880 --> 43:49.520]  this Monoprice Thunderbolt three cable and it worked too, with both studio displays. So just
[43:49.520 --> 43:58.720]  just taking me from 99.9% to 99.99% that I what I got was a bum Thunderbolt cable from Apple. Well,
[43:58.720 --> 44:03.200]  and all I can think is how many other I don't know how common this is. Hopefully I'm like the
[44:03.200 --> 44:08.480]  one person who's ever bought a studio display who got a bad cable. But I kind of suspect that
[44:08.480 --> 44:13.600]  may not be that may not be the case. I mean, how many people you think have actually received
[44:13.600 --> 44:18.960]  their studio displays so far? Yeah, it's probably not a huge number. The reason I
[44:18.960 --> 44:23.120]  Well, number one, it's just when you have a podcast, it's your right to complain about
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.640]  anything that goes wrong with your purchase. But I thought and I guess I should write about this too.
[44:28.640 --> 44:34.800]  Because I, as I googled the problem, it didn't seem like anybody it does. This does not seem to
[44:34.800 --> 44:40.560]  be a common problem, at least in terms of searching with with the web for people with
[44:40.560 --> 44:46.560]  a studio display that just won't show any picture but does show the three dots. I did find one
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.880]  support thread at Apple where a lot of people some people were describing what seems to be the same
[44:50.880 --> 44:56.160]  problem, but they were all from back in like April. And and it was one of those like unsatisfying
[44:56.160 --> 45:00.080]  threads where nobody seemed to know what to do other than to send the whole thing back. It seemed
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.360]  like most of the people on the thread solved the problem by sending the whole display back to Apple
[45:05.360 --> 45:10.400]  and getting a new one. So I'm tossing this out there because getting a new cable is a hell of a
[45:10.400 --> 45:15.440]  lot easier than getting a new display. And in fact, if you get your display and have the bum
[45:15.440 --> 45:21.280]  cable like I did, you might be as the type of person who a listens to the show and be bought
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.000]  a studio display, you might have a Thunderbolt three or four cable or two or three or drawer
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.560]  full of them already. Just tried try a different cable. Anyway, which were you guessing bad cable?
[45:33.280 --> 45:37.840]  No, I would never that would have taken like, I think it would take me a very long time to figure
[45:37.840 --> 45:42.720]  that out. Because like, I would never, I always assume that cables work. They might not, they
[45:42.720 --> 45:46.800]  might be the wrong cable. But I've always assumed like, if I have the right cable that it is like
[45:46.800 --> 45:51.360]  this infallible thing, it cannot break, it will not break that it can't be the cables fault. It's
[45:51.360 --> 45:55.920]  like, it's like, when you're a programmer, and you're running into a bug, you never want to blame
[45:55.920 --> 46:01.200]  the compiler. Because chances are, it's like, it's like blaming the controller when you lose
[46:01.200 --> 46:04.960]  when you're playing video games with your friend when you're a kid. It's the controller. You just
[46:04.960 --> 46:10.960]  lost. It's never the compiler's fault, except like, maybe once in your career, it might actually be
[46:10.960 --> 46:16.640]  like, it's not a very common thing. It's very unlikely for any given bug is the compiler's
[46:16.640 --> 46:22.240]  fault. But compilers do occasionally have bugs that occasionally bite you. But it's just it's so
[46:22.880 --> 46:27.440]  extremely unlikely to actually be the reason that you should never assume that. And that's how I
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.640]  feel about cables. Like, chances are like this, especially a brand new cable from Apple, like,
[46:32.640 --> 46:35.360]  what are the odds that would be bad? I would never assume that.
[46:35.360 --> 46:42.720]  It does. I have this. I have the bum cable right here with me. Right. And it feels wonderful.
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.600]  Yeah, it's a very nice feeling. And the other thing too, is like sometimes and I know you,
[46:47.600 --> 46:53.760]  you guys on ATP have talked about this, this phenomenon many times. Everybody who's been using
[46:53.760 --> 47:00.160]  iPhones for the last decade knows it. Sometimes lightning cables develop like either aid that they
[47:00.160 --> 47:06.000]  fray, like because the way Apple makes its lightning cables, it seems like a problem
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.760]  they've sort of licked. But especially like in the early years of lightning, like where it flexes
[47:11.760 --> 47:18.720]  towards the connector, the actual rubber, whatever you call the substance that wraps the cable would
[47:18.720 --> 47:23.920]  fray. Like if it looks frayed, if you can actually see the copper from a hole in the wire, and then
[47:23.920 --> 47:28.480]  the cable doesn't work, you're like, oh, yeah, I should throw this cable out. I probably should
[47:28.480 --> 47:32.960]  have thrown it out as soon as it got frayed. Or when the little, I don't know what you call them,
[47:32.960 --> 47:37.680]  the little copper things, the little metallic things on the end of the lightning start building
[47:37.680 --> 47:43.600]  up that black char. Yeah, the pins get that like that carbonized. Yeah, it's and it makes it not
[47:43.600 --> 47:48.000]  charge anymore, basically. Yeah, it did. And then if that cable doesn't work, you're like, yeah,
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.480]  because it looks like shit, right? It looks it looks defective. If the cable is brand new,
[47:52.480 --> 47:57.680]  I never I, I'm actually sort of pleased with myself that it even occurred to me to try the
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.920]  other cable. That can be your victory for Well, but I wonder if I would have tried my
[48:03.920 --> 48:10.560]  Monoprice Thunderbolt cable if I didn't have happened to be a weirdo product reviewer who
[48:10.560 --> 48:17.360]  had another studio display right next to him on his desk and had literally the exact same cable
[48:18.080 --> 48:23.200]  right next to it. I don't know. What a weird what a weird problem. So anyway, MacBook Air.
[48:23.200 --> 48:29.360]  Yeah. So I have my CalDigit Thunderbolt four cable over there right on the floor because I
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.880]  literally just migration assistant did myself over to it yesterday when I got it. I have to say I am
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.560]  very pleased by it. So I got it. Partly partly because my 14 inch is having a lot of weird
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.800]  problems. And I think I have to send it back to Apple for service soon. And I Oh, one of them you
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.880]  actually witnessed while you were here where it just refused to accept charging input from either
[48:52.880 --> 48:59.680]  MagSafe or USB C until I rebooted it like until I shut it down and powered it back up. And that has
[48:59.680 --> 49:05.680]  happened three times so far. I mentioned this briefly on ATP a couple episodes ago. And I've
[49:05.680 --> 49:11.280]  heard from a couple of people already who say their 14 inch MacBook Pro has the same problem,
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.200]  which is very concerning to me. Like if it was just mine, I think okay, well, maybe it's some
[49:15.200 --> 49:19.680]  weird fluke on the back. The fact that it's multiple people seeing this issue. Now I'm like,
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.240]  Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that feeling. But we'll see how that how that turns out. And
[49:24.240 --> 49:32.000]  even ever since I got it from day one. It's been really weird about certain things like it. It
[49:32.000 --> 49:37.120]  doesn't really hold on to my iCloud login very well. Certain things like like they don't they
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.640]  just don't sync properly to it. It has it will like deregister itself from certain things for
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.840]  some reason. Like I just I don't it's been it's just been weird. And so I have to at minimum,
[49:47.840 --> 49:53.120]  like reformat it and reinstall everything and do it or do it all from scratch at minimum. But I
[49:53.120 --> 49:56.000]  think there may also be a hardware component here. So I don't know what's going on. Oh,
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.920]  and I have to like reboot it regularly in order for FaceTime calls to come in. Because if I don't
[50:01.920 --> 50:06.800]  reboot it, like right before I expect a FaceTime call, it probably won't ring on it. It sounds
[50:06.800 --> 50:12.320]  haunted. Yeah, it's weird. And and this has been since day one that I and it was weird. So I,
[50:12.320 --> 50:18.080]  I got when the M one max and pro laptops came out last fall, I replaced my whole setup with two of
[50:18.080 --> 50:22.960]  them. I got a 16 inch to be my desktop basically. And then I got this 14 inch to be my portable and
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.240]  everything else. And I hadn't done a clean install for a while because migration assistant is really
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.280]  good. And so you can you can carry forward a migration assistant installation of your computer
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.840]  for years and years and years. And it's usually fine. Like it almost never has any problems. But
[50:37.840 --> 50:42.880]  I decided I had done that for a while I decided I wanted to start clean new architecture with the
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.560]  new m one stuff. And I wanted a whole clean slate, I do everything clean. And so I literally on my
[50:48.560 --> 50:54.000]  desk when I set these up, I had the 14 inch and the 16 inch right next to each other on my desk.
[50:54.640 --> 50:59.680]  And because I have gotten myself used to using a trackpad with my left hand at my desk,
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.760]  right mouse left trackpad, I was able to operate the trackpad of both of them at the same time with
[51:05.760 --> 51:11.200]  one with each hand. And as I was setting them up, I was doing everything in parallel, setting them
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.720]  both up the exact same way. So they would be so all the settings would be the same, the trackpad
[51:16.720 --> 51:21.680]  speed, the mouse pointer settings, like everything would be the same. All the software I installed,
[51:21.680 --> 51:28.320]  it was all the same, everything was the same. And yet my 16 inch is perfect. It is so like my 16
[51:28.320 --> 51:33.360]  inch is amazing. Everything works perfectly on it. I've never had a problem with it. My 14 inch
[51:33.360 --> 51:38.720]  constant problems, like constant little paper cut problems. So I don't know what it is. Anyway,
[51:38.720 --> 51:43.040]  so I got to do I got to figure out what's going on there and have something there.
[51:43.040 --> 51:50.880]  Also, when the m one max came out, and there was the capability for them to run iPad apps,
[51:50.880 --> 51:56.320]  unmodified, even from developers that hadn't used catalyst. I'm one of those developers,
[51:56.320 --> 52:01.680]  I hadn't used catalyst. There's a bunch of reasons why I didn't ever port overcast using catalyst,
[52:01.680 --> 52:04.640]  I might do it in the future, I don't know yet. But there are a bunch of reasons why it was it
[52:04.640 --> 52:08.560]  didn't really make sense for me to do that when it first came out. But with this, this was literally
[52:08.560 --> 52:14.640]  just like, if if I do nothing, if I don't opt out, if I just do nothing, my app will become available
[52:14.640 --> 52:21.440]  on m one max. And it mostly works. So I thought, well, great, I will not opt out, I will do nothing.
[52:21.440 --> 52:25.440]  And I'll just kind of get free Mac users. And that'll be that'll be good for the handful of
[52:25.440 --> 52:30.160]  people who want to do that. And it isn't the best experience by any means. I mean, using overcast
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.640]  in the Mac is terrible, in my opinion, usually you're using it not because it's the best way
[52:34.640 --> 52:40.160]  to play podcasts ever made on a Mac, but because you want overcast on your Mac for some reason.
[52:40.160 --> 52:43.680]  And this is better than the website because websites even worse than the Mac app. I admit
[52:43.680 --> 52:50.720]  this freely, the websites terrible. I hate working on it. Oh, well. So anyway, I thought, okay, well,
[52:50.720 --> 52:56.800]  I just I just don't opt out. And I will get it as I said, free Mac app. Well, there are some asterisks
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.680]  on that. So it turns out the free Mac app was mostly correct. The app mostly works on the Mac.
[53:02.400 --> 53:08.800]  However, occasionally, there's some weird bug in either like that layer, like whatever the catalyst
[53:08.800 --> 53:13.520]  like layer is that makes these apps run on the Mac, or a bug in Xcode, where building things will
[53:13.520 --> 53:18.080]  like build something on the Mac that shouldn't be built for the Mac or enable some SDK that doesn't
[53:18.080 --> 53:22.240]  exist in the Mac. And then when somebody in the Mac goes to run it, it crashes. So there's there's
[53:22.240 --> 53:27.760]  occasional problems that cause crashing bugs in the Mac app that is supposed to run unmodified,
[53:27.760 --> 53:32.640]  but doesn't quite. And so I occasionally have to work around those because if I don't,
[53:32.640 --> 53:36.640]  I'll get one star reviews from people who now expect this to be a thing because it's been a thing.
[53:38.800 --> 53:45.280]  And secondly, people have started reporting bugs about beta versions of the Mac OS.
[53:45.280 --> 53:47.840]  That's I knew this was going to beta versions.
[53:47.840 --> 53:56.400]  Yep. And so now like, okay, now I have to actually so and then thirdly, I am also working in Xcode,
[53:56.400 --> 54:01.200]  doing a lot of new Swift UI work trying to kind of build like the the found the next foundation of
[54:01.200 --> 54:06.400]  the apps interface. So just like the big structural pieces, the split view for the iPad, the three
[54:06.400 --> 54:11.920]  column views on Mac and iPad, that collapses down to the iPhone single column view stuff like that.
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.440]  And a lot of this stuff has just changed in this beta series. There's a whole bunch of
[54:17.440 --> 54:23.200]  new Swift UI stuff that makes a lot of this a lot better. And it only works on iOS 16 and Mac OS,
[54:23.200 --> 54:29.120]  whatever the new one is. And so I've never run the Mac betas ever because I'm not I haven't
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.120]  been a Mac developer, like of Mac apps that matter, except forecast. But that's that's not
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.480]  a big app. And that doesn't seem that doesn't really get broken in betas. So I'm not really
[54:36.480 --> 54:42.560]  a Mac developer before this. And I wouldn't want to run the betas on my own machines because I need
[54:42.560 --> 54:50.080]  my max to be rocks, like I need them to be stable and 100% reliable. I'm also a podcaster. And most
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.640]  audio software either won't run on the betas, or shouldn't at least be run on the betas, because
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.040]  you can't quite count on it because it's a beta, right? So that makes sense. So I can't I can't
[55:01.040 --> 55:05.520]  put the beta on any machine that I actually need to use to record podcasts ever, because my software
[55:05.520 --> 55:12.000]  won't run correctly or reliably on it. So I have to, if I'm going to put the beta on something,
[55:12.000 --> 55:18.000]  it has to be something else. And my laptop is having lots of problems. So I decided,
[55:18.000 --> 55:24.320]  let me buy an air. And I will use it for betas and a couple other little accessory roles around the
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.960]  house. And then I then once I have it, I can also then figure out what's going on with my 14 and
[55:28.960 --> 55:34.080]  maybe send it in for service or if I have to do something there. So here I am long story short,
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.640]  with the MacBook Air and I was fortunate enough to be at WWDC and to see them all in person at
[55:40.640 --> 55:48.960]  the press hands on area. And I that that broke me like, as soon as I picked one up, I was like, Oh,
[55:49.680 --> 55:58.640]  ooh, this feels really good. I did the same thing, where I got to the hands on area after the event.
[55:58.640 --> 56:04.640]  And I had number one, and I would like you to tell the story again. I know you told it on ATP,
[56:04.640 --> 56:09.280]  but for the the two listeners who don't listen to both our shows, it's a good story while you
[56:09.280 --> 56:17.680]  were waiting for the midnight one. But everybody wanted to see midnight. And so I went and found
[56:17.680 --> 56:25.920]  a starlight and there was nobody in line for it yet. And I had no interest in clicking around
[56:25.920 --> 56:33.200]  Mac OS on this or doing anything on the computer, because the display is nice and it is an upgrade
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.760]  for the air. But I'm familiar with the notch. So I don't need to look at that because I've
[56:37.760 --> 56:45.040]  had the MacBook Pro with the notch. And it's not the promotion one with the higher resolution and
[56:45.040 --> 56:49.360]  whatever other the technical differences are that the MacBook Pro display. So I don't really care.
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.640]  I looked at the display, it looked fine. So what I expected, I don't need to use Mac OS 10 at all.
[56:54.640 --> 56:59.760]  All I wanted to do is pick it up. And I wanted to close that close the lid, open the lid,
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.720]  close the lid, open the lid, pick it up while the lid was open, pick it up while the lid was closed,
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.840]  sort of give it a feel. And I was like, God damn, that's thin. And whoever it was from product
[57:09.840 --> 57:15.120]  marketing was like, isn't that nice? And I was like, yes, that is very nice. And I was like,
[57:15.120 --> 57:19.120]  I'm glad you're not selling them here on the spot. And he just laughed. And then I walked
[57:19.120 --> 57:22.880]  away and let somebody else have a turn with it. But all I wanted to do, the thing could not have
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.200]  even been powered on and I would have gotten everything I wanted out of the hands-on.
[57:28.160 --> 57:30.880]  Yeah, me too. The first thing I did was close it and pick it up.
[57:30.880 --> 57:35.840]  Well, my thing was, I really wanted to see if when it was closed, if when you lifted the lid,
[57:35.840 --> 57:40.080]  if the whole thing would lift up, because it's so at some point that's right. Well, in fact,
[57:40.080 --> 57:46.080]  I'm sure I threw out like a shout out to Apple's hinge team in my review, because I don't feel like
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.880]  they're getting enough credit. The hinges, even through the butterfly keyboard era of
[57:51.920 --> 57:58.880]  bad MacBooks of the last six years, the hinges have continued to get nothing but better.
[57:58.880 --> 58:07.120]  Nothing but better on Apple's laptops. Their hinge game is, nobody else in the industry
[58:07.120 --> 58:12.960]  touches them. They're just phenomenal. And these newer ones are better than ever. And the hinge,
[58:13.840 --> 58:19.840]  it does indeed lift the screen without lifting the bottom part. It's so light though, the danger
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.360]  you get into is it does sort of slide around the desk, depending on how much friction your
[58:25.360 --> 58:29.680]  desk surface has with the rubber feet. And there's, I don't see how there's anything they can do
[58:29.680 --> 58:35.120]  about that as, as they continue to get lighter. Yeah. I remember in, in some of the early rumors
[58:35.120 --> 58:39.600]  of the, of these redesigns, there was a room with the feet would be like these long rectangles.
[58:39.600 --> 58:44.960]  Oh yeah. Or the ovals rather. Yeah. It was like long strips along the whole length of the body.
[58:44.960 --> 58:50.560]  Like that, that actually would be hideously ugly, but would be more functional. I see
[58:50.560 --> 58:53.360]  why they didn't do it. Yeah. I mean, that, that would, that would be pretty rough looking.
[58:53.360 --> 58:57.920]  So I understand why they didn't do it, but yeah, this, this thing feels fantastic. I mean,
[58:58.480 --> 59:04.000]  and, and it is, it's interesting because it is in many ways, a low end product. And that's part of,
[59:04.000 --> 59:07.520]  part of why some of its limitations are the way they are. Like I noticed with the screen,
[59:08.400 --> 59:15.600]  one, one big difference with the screen is that it is, it is what before the current 14 and 16
[59:15.600 --> 59:23.680]  inch laptops, all of the 2016 forward models, I believe they all shipped by default in a scaling
[59:23.680 --> 59:30.320]  mode. Yeah. So the pixels were not exactly two X retina. They, it was, it was the old resolution
[59:30.320 --> 59:35.040]  that like the 15 inch originally shipped in with, with its retina. And they, they bumped up the
[59:35.040 --> 59:38.560]  effective resolution and made everything a little bit smaller, but it didn't actually have the
[59:38.560 --> 59:43.360]  pixels to back that up. So they were just running it in a scaled mode that was like very slightly
[59:43.360 --> 59:50.080]  soft looking. And the 14 and 16 inch release last year, finally fixed that they finally made it so
[59:50.080 --> 59:56.000]  that it was exactly two X pixels natively to its default settings. The MacBook air, the new one
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  does not do that. It is in a scaled mode the way they all used to be for, since 2016. And frankly,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.680]  I I'm starting to lose closeup vision a little bit. I'm probably going to get glasses soon,
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:10.720]  but frankly, I don't see that difference as far as I can tell. I might, I was trying to compare
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.200]  side by side earlier with like, you know, it's text sharper and everything. And I think it is
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.720]  sharper on the new 14 and 16s, but it's a small enough difference that I wouldn't make the
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:26.400]  decision based solely upon that. Do you see that difference? Nope. My eyes, I mean, Hey, I'm 49,
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.840]  so I'm ahead of, I'm a decade ahead of you on the aging aspect and I have other vision. I mean,
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:37.120]  my vision's good. I just actually just was at the eye doctor the other day and it's effective 2020
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:43.040]  vision when I have my glasses on. So it's good, but I do not see fine details like that anymore.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.680]  I cannot even, I could take my glasses off. I can get as close to the screen as I can.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:54.480]  I can't really see that, but I am a hundred percent convinced that me from 15 years ago
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.280]  or earlier absolutely would have been able to see the difference. Yeah, I think five years ago,
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.480]  I, cause five years ago when they did make this change, I did notice it and I hated it. And I
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.320]  actually would run my laptops at the larger scaled mode just so it would be native. Cause it actually
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  looked better to me back then. But yeah, now I think I've lost that ability fortunately. But
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.120]  the one thing I do notice about the display, fortunately, I think the same thing. I'm like,
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.240]  thank God my eyes have gone to shit and I can look at this and it doesn't bug me. Yeah. It's like,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.520]  I have enough things that bug me. Let's, let's knock this one out. Wait until your ears go and
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.720]  you can start buying cheap headphones. One thing I did notice though, is that, and I notice this
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:39.040]  instantly, the bezel around the screen is significantly wider than the bezel on the 14
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:45.520]  and 16 inch. And so it looks less nice. Now it's still overall, this is still a very nice looking
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.560]  machine. However, when you compare it directly to the 14 inch, it is the 14 inch looks higher end
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.800]  and more modern in part because that bezel is narrower on the 14 inch. And that's true with the
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.200]  iPad pros and the iPad air. Yes, that's right. Except I think that with the MacBook air to the
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.280]  MacBook pros, it's even more of a difference. I believe you're right. Yeah. Cause the iPad pro
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.680]  and iPad air is a very small difference. Yeah. But it's, it's, it is noticeable. Yeah. Especially
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:19.280]  when you look at them side by side. And I will add that in the hands-on area, of course, why would
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.040]  they have 14 inch or 16 inch MacBook pros, which aren't new, but when you don't have them side by
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.880]  side to like, look at them, it didn't occur to me a month ago at WWDC that the bezel was thicker
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.040]  because I had nothing to compare it against. But now that I'm at my house and I have one right
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.800]  there, I'm like, Oh, the bezel sticker. I should've, I should've made a note. I'm going to make a
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.480]  note. I should have added that to my things that could be nicer about the MacBook air.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:47.440]  Yeah. But overall though, like I, as soon as like I've, I've been carried around the house
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.600]  doing various little tasks and stuff for the last couple of days, it is so nice to pick up and carry
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:01.120]  around. And I never thought the 14 inch was particularly heavy, but in comparison, it's a
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.760]  massive difference. Like psychologically, like when you pick it up, both the thinness and the
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:12.240]  weight difference, it is significant. You notice it, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.160]  incredible. And I wish they would make a 12 inch or third, or, you know, 11 inch, one of these,
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.680]  I think that would be incredible if they could do it without major compromises. Like the old
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:28.960]  12 inch MacBook was full of compromises. The old 11 inch air really wasn't, no, it wasn't.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:35.120]  I had one for years, possibly my second favorite Mac of all time. Yeah. Like they were able to do
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.040]  the, that old 11 inch air. The, the only major compromise for that was that the screen was very
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:43.200]  small and, and it, and that was part just the technology of the time. I mean, that was a long
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:49.040]  time ago. That machine came out, I believe in 2010 or 2008 was it? So I think 2010, I think.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.760]  But the other downside to it, cause I just, I looked it up while writing my review last week.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.640]  The other downside is it was quite thick at the thick end of the wedge, like the wedge shape,
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:07.760]  the iconic wedge shape of MacBook Airs until now used to be a lot more wedgie to put it another
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.560]  way. It always tapered to a nice thin point at the opening where you open the hinge, but the,
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.800]  that's where the 11, it's like, how did the 11 inch air do that? And it's like, oh, it was really
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.720]  thick in the back. Yeah. I have next to me here, I have an 11 inch iPad pro with the keyboard case,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.400]  not the, the old kind of keyboard case, not the magic one with the trackpad, but the old Apple
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:33.520]  folio thing. And if I compare these two, like they feel very, they both feel similarly like bulky,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:39.120]  but the 11 inch MacBook or the 11 inch iPad is significantly lighter and significantly smaller.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:47.200]  If they could make the MacBook Air closer to that 11 inch iPad pro form factor. And I bet they
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.680]  could, that would be a heck of a product assuming there weren't again, assuming there weren't major
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:56.080]  compromises, but I bet they could do it. I mean, I think the biggest challenge would be
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.800]  how the design integrates the keyboard with that. That I think is the main trick, you know,
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.560]  assuming that it would just basically be what we have now with this 13 inch air, just kind of like
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.240]  shaving off the edges next to the keyboard and just kind of shrinking it down that way.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.400]  I think that could be incredible. And if they could get it close to that two pound target
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.680]  that the 12 inch MacBook was what a computer that would be for portability. But, but I understand
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.720]  like for most people, this is fine. Like for most people, this is as small as they need it to be.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.520]  And I guarantee you, this would always sell way, way, way more than, than a smaller one would. But
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.320]  I think there is an appetite for a smaller MacBook ever since they discontinued the 12 inch.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:42.800]  And this gets very close to solving that need. But it doesn't quite get there in certain ways.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.960]  And man, that would be incredible. And the iPad just sitting there showing us like, look,
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.760]  you can run this exact same hardware and an iPad and it's fine, like, just make a Mac version of
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.600]  it. I think the only downside I really do believe that the one and only downside is it would get
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.160]  some, however, whatever proportion it would be smaller by volume compared to this one,
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.760]  the 13 inch MacBook Air, it would get that proportion less battery life. And that would
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:15.200]  be the one and only downside. I suspect it would have the exact same ports, MagSafe,
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.000]  two USB-C Thunderbolt ports. The new MacBook Air, the one that we're talking about, the M2 MacBook
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.720]  Air doesn't even know it has aluminum to the left and right of the keyboard. There's no that's not
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.680]  where the speakers are. The speakers are underneath the keyboard or behind the keyboard. I guess I
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.600]  don't know where else they put it. Are they firing into the hinge? I think there's I think there's
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.480]  four speakers and I think some are under the keyboard and some are firing into the hinge.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:47.840]  Or maybe they're all firing into the hinge. I don't know. But it sounds just great for a MacBook Air.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.280]  Well, you don't think so? I will disagree. All right. All right. You have better ears than me.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.360]  I did a side by side speaker comparison with the 14 inch MacBook Pro. Oh, no, no, that's a more
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:02.160]  MacBook Pro. And yeah, it's I mean, the speaker I'd say the speakers are pretty OK, relative to
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.640]  the PC world, they're great. Relative to other current Macs, they're awful. But I see why they
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:12.640]  did it the way they did for this product. I mean, part of the reason why you know, this product not
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.640]  only is it very small and light, it's also inexpensive. We're also just talking about
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:23.280]  stuff. So to move up to the much more complicated speaker setup that the 14 inch has, it takes space
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.800]  and cost and weight. And so I I see why they did what they did for this model. I think it makes
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.920]  sense for this model. However, that is one thing I definitely miss when using it compared to the 14
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:40.560]  inch. The speakers are significantly less loud at max volume and are substantially worse quality.
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.240]  Yeah, but that's compared to the MacBook Pro, which starts at two thousand dollars compared
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.640]  to the older MacBook Airs. I think the new MacBook Air actually sounds better. I don't think it's
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:53.920]  like night and day better. The MacBook Pros for a couple of years now, but the 14 and the current
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:00.960]  14 and 16 inch are sort of to me, wow, I can't believe this is laptops built in speakers. I
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.640]  it's kind of shocking to me. It just phenomenally good sound for built into a laptop speakers.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.560]  The new MacBook Air is not like that at all. But I'm I'm I'm convinced I could Pepsi challenge it
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.280]  with the old MacBook Air. I think that they've made it sound better than ever for a MacBook Air.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.400]  And I just the fact that it doesn't use speaker grills to the side makes me think whatever they're
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  doing, they could do on an 11 inch or 12 inch, whatever they want to call it, too. I think they
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.880]  would call it 11 inch, though, to give it two inches of marketing separation, 11, 13, 15,
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:38.000]  because everybody seems to think rumor wise, they're working on a 15 inch MacBook Air, which
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.680]  we could talk about, too. And then that to me, that's a cohesive lineup. 11, 13, 15 MacBook Airs
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:50.000]  and 14, 16 MacBook Pros, the speakers, no comparison, just the same way that the 14
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.640]  and 16 have promotion, the variable refresh rate up to 120. My eyes. I mean, you really have to
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.480]  have like vision problems not to see that difference when you're scrolling. It's that's
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.920]  super visible. I see it side by side. But when I don't have it, I don't miss. Yeah, same thing.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.760]  That's the same thing. I thought as I use the MacBook Air for a week to write my review,
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.440]  I didn't see it. It stopped being an issue. Let's pick this up. I've got to get through
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:20.080]  these sponsors. I love them all. God, I love these sponsors. Got to talk colors. Oh, we got
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:24.240]  to talk colors, colors and sizes. We're going to take a quick second here to talk about Hover.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.280]  That's one of our sponsors. And this is where you go to register domain names. Do you have ideas?
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:33.200]  You have an idea for a new website? What do you need? You need a domain name. You got an idea for
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:39.200]  a new project? You got to get a domain name. Hover has over 300 domain name extensions,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.400]  the top level domains, the things like dot com, dot net, dot coffee, whatever the hell you want,
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.000]  300 of them to choose from. When you're building your brand online, no matter what you want to
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.160]  build, there's a good domain name waiting for it. They have search for domain names. Let's say you
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.520]  want something something dot com and something something dot com is taken. Their search will help
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:09.760]  you find either something something else dot com or something something dot some other top level
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:15.920]  domain intelligently. It's not like some stupid regular expression search thing that I would write
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:22.400]  in two minutes. It is a really, really clever search engine. You type what you're hoping for
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.280]  and they make really, really good suggestions to help you find what's actually available.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.560]  Some of these top level domains, depending on where they are, have different prices.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:37.520]  Find a price that you're happy with. Also, Hover has absolutely phenomenal support,
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.760]  a support team. And they they're really just there to help you. Like if you have domain names
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:50.960]  at a different registrar who you'd like to move to Hover, they will do everything necessary to
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.960]  help you move that stuff over so that nothing gets messed up. Your website keeps working. Your email
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.200]  keeps working. You don't miss email for two days because you misconfigured an MX server or
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.400]  something while you're moving your domain from old registrar to Hover. They will help you with
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:12.000]  everything. That's all they do. And what they don't do is upsell you on nonsense. And they don't need
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.120]  to upsell you because when you get a domain at Hover, you get everything you'd want included.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.240]  Everything, any kind of privacy type features, all that sort of stuff that other registrars charge
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.280]  you extra for. Why in the world would you charge somebody extra for domain name registration privacy?
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:34.800]  Because they're not good. Hover is very, very good. Really just one of the company I've been
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.200]  aware of for a long time. I have never heard anybody say a bad word about Hover.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:44.720]  And it's because they're just great. Great service, great prices, great technical features,
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.200]  great technical support. If you want, you can actually keep your site anchored at Hover if you
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:57.200]  don't have somewhere to move it right now. Just everything you'd want, just fantastic.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:04.240]  Where do you go to find out more? Go to Hover, H-O-V-E-R, Hover.com slash talk show, Hover.com
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.800]  slash talk show. Use that URL when you register a new domain or sign up. You get a 10% discount.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.960]  And you get that discount with a referral link on all new purchases. Make a name for yourself
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.680]  with Hover. Once again, go to Hover.com slash the talk show.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.240]  Before we move off the size thing, the 15 inch, the lack of a bigger consumer,
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.240]  I mentioned this in my review and I kind of felt guilty about it because I was looking, I felt like
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.680]  it's like my review was so effusive. I was like, I got to, it's got to be some kind of butt section.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.360]  The lack of a small one, that's a thing. And it's like if Apple never makes a smaller than
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.720]  13 inch MacBook again, I think that's all right. I think for people who travel a lot,
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:52.960]  having a small one is huge. People who actually work on, to go back to airplane trays.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.800]  I also think there's a lot of people, I know this, it's not me, right? It's not you, Marco.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:03.920]  But there's a lot of people who the nature of their work is they are the people who are the
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.040]  nature of their work is they are, they don't, they're not in an office all the time. They're
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.000]  on their feet, right? Like a couple of years ago before COVID, I was on a, I don't really
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.120]  volunteer for much of anything really, but I volunteered to be on sort of a alumni group
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.600]  at Drexel University here in Philadelphia for a period of time. We had a couple meetings.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.800]  And this is when the 12 inch MacBook was still, I think it was still on sale. So maybe four years
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.960]  ago, something like that. And somebody who was a professor at Drexel was on the same committee type
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.160]  on. And he was using it. I was there a couple of minutes early and he was pounding out some emails
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:44.560]  on it. And he seemed to know basically who I was. And we got to talking about Max. And I asked him
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:51.040]  how he likes the 12 inch MacBook. And he said he loved it. Absolutely loved it because he has an
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:58.160]  office, but he's never there. He's all over campus, all over Philadelphia, all day, every day, taking
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:05.440]  his MacBook with him. He's either using it or it is weight on his shoulders. It's either one of two
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.040]  things all day, every day. That's how he lives. The smaller and lighter, the better. Can't make a
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.560]  MacBook small enough and light enough to please this person. And that makes all the sense in the
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.920]  world, right? I think there's a huge market for it. I don't think it's as big as the 13 inch. And
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:28.160]  again, is it going to end up being like the iPhone mini, right? Where it's like some of us absolutely
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.880]  love the damn thing, but it doesn't sell well enough for Apple to keep it around? I don't know.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.880]  But I can't help but think that the reason they stopped making, the only reason they stopped
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:44.400]  making the 12 inch MacBook was the Intel processor sucked, right? And the butterfly keyboard. They
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.800]  stopped making it around the same time that they started moving away from the butterfly
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:54.320]  keyboard finally. And I think that machine would have been the hardest one to move away from it,
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.040]  just because there was the least amount of extra space in there. I wonder though, does the fixed
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:06.800]  keyboard, the one that they use now, does it actually have more depth? It does, but I think
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.240]  it's a small difference. When they went around and removed all the butterflies and replaced them with
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.760]  the new Magic Keyboard, the models that they were going into did not get thicker. They were able to
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.400]  do a direct swap, and the rest of the machine did not change noticeably. I think it might have
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.880]  changed very slightly, but officially if you'd measured it with calipers, I think it was very
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.520]  slightly thicker machines, but it was not anything people noticed. And so it didn't seem like it's
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.840]  that much thicker, which just makes the butterfly keyboard all the more baffling and infuriating.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:40.960]  But again, we're going to leave that behind with the Trump administration. That's in the past now.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.920]  We're not going to dwell on that. But I think obviously things are very different now,
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.520]  architecturally, and the power and heat needs and the space needs are so much more improved now with
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:56.400]  Apple Silicon. And I think when they were doing this transition to Apple Silicon, I predicted on
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.840]  ATP, and I think like many people did, that whatever the first batch of machines was that
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:08.880]  came out with their chips would include some kind of radically tiny laptop. That now they could show
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.760]  off what they could really make with these awesome new chips that had such low power needs, and they
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:20.880]  were going to really like flex what they could do and have like a statement machine that was the new
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.920]  11 or 12 inch laptop that is so small and so light and gets great battery life and has great
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:34.160]  performance. And they didn't do that. And I think this new MacBook Air kind of is that, or at least
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.920]  it is the most, it's the closest to that that we've gotten yet. But I can't help but wonder
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.680]  if their plans might have been different if not for COVID and supply chain changes.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:50.480]  Apple has done a very good job of keeping continuous updates and continuous manufacturing
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:56.320]  and continuous service through what has to have been a ridiculously challenging time
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.640]  for their operations. And they've mostly shielded us from that, like almost every other company
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.640]  that you that you need to buy stuff from. You try to order stuff anytime in the last year,
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.040]  and it's been a challenge, right? And you've had everything's weirdly out of stock and things are
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.760]  delayed weirdly, and they can't get parts for certain things. Apple has done a very good job
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:20.080]  of hiding any of that from really coming out. Like for their products, they they really seem like
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.720]  we can get Apple stuff reliably. And I'm sure things have, I'm sure behind the scenes, people
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.320]  are running around with their heads caught off like it's crazy, I'm sure behind the scenes, but
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.200]  they've done a very good job of preventing that from being visible to their customers.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.520]  But maybe this is some of the effects of that, like maybe they wanted to do more product releases
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.880]  or different product releases, more adventurous product releases, and they had to delay or cancel
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.040]  or change them over the last couple of years because of all this. So maybe that's the reason,
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.160]  or maybe the reason was that they just aren't ready to do it yet. And they were focusing on
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:56.000]  their highest volume products first. But I still whatever the reason has been, I really hope that
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.560]  they make that statement laptop again, because this this new MacBook Air is very good. And it's
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:09.360]  very close to that. But it's not that it is not that like groundbreaking, amazing statement like
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:18.160]  it this is this is like the one that you marry like this. It's making this is like, this machine
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:24.960]  is the most fantastic all around her for almost everybody. Like it this is an amazing machine.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:30.000]  There's basically no downside except speakers kind of suck. There's basically no downside
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  otherwise, like, this machine is great. It's great for everyone for almost everything. However,
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.120]  it's not that like bombshell, right? Like that when you first picked up a 12 inch MacBook,
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.000]  it was like, you couldn't believe it was real. And this, you believe it's real, but you're still
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.280]  very impressed by it. This one is impressive when you pick it up and close it and you just
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:00.400]  sort of carry it around like a dealing only with the depth, or whatever you want to call it the
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.320]  height, I guess the height, they call it the thickness, right? When you're only thinking
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.600]  about the thickness, you're like, Damn, this is something. But the footprint is exactly the same.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:16.960]  It is you put it on top of the old M1 MacBook Air, and it's effectively the same footprint.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:24.480]  So the footprint isn't Wow. Whereas a hypothetical 11 inch version of this could be a total
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:30.880]  Wow for every dimension, height, width, depth, whatever. And I had the same thought as you,
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:37.680]  where for that stretch of years where we all knew, even though we didn't know, no, but it's like,
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:42.720]  come on, it was kind of obvious that they were going to move the Macs to Apple's own chips.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:49.040]  Once the iPhone started beating high end MacBook Pros in single threaded benchmarks,
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.720]  it's like, of course, they're going to move the Mac to these to their own chips, not the actual
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.680]  iPhone chips, but they'll just do what they effectively did is take their iPhone chip
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.480]  technology and then just because they're going to go into Macs put more cores in them and make
[01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:08.240]  them appropriate for Macs and they're going to be great. I thought the same thing as you that
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:15.280]  they'll start with the Wow, look how tiny this thing is. And instead they did the total opposite,
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:20.880]  which is that they put all of the original M1 Macs were literally put into the exact same
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.720]  form factors of the previous generation, last generation Intel versions of the MacBook Air,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.080]  the MacBook 13 inch MacBook Pro, and the Mac Mini. And in hindsight, it makes all the sense
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.880]  in the world. I've been told by numerous people, I've written about it that part of it was that
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.640]  they wanted to keep it as secret as possible for as long as possible, just in case so that the
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.000]  whatever however permanently damaged their relationship with Intel would be once this
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:53.680]  was official, they wanted to delay that as long as possible, keep competitors from knowing when
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.120]  they were going to do it. And then secondarily, it's it's exactly like when you were making that
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.080]  analogy to debugging a program, and you don't think it's going to be the compiler. It's like
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.640]  one of the things when you're doing something radically new in software is you want to minimize
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:18.560]  any changes elsewhere in the whole project. Like if you're going to switch from this database server
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.080]  to that database server, don't make any changes other than database stuff, right? That's enough.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.840]  Keep everything else the same. And then once you're sure that the new database is every bit
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:35.360]  is good, or hopefully, why else are you switching better? Okay, now we can go back to making changes,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:38.720]  right? And that they had that sort of mindset with with the Macs of,
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.640]  let's just not change anything we fixed, we finally fixed the fucking keyboards.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.560]  Let's not take any chances of something like somebody who has a bright idea of let's put
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.000]  an all new trackpad technology in. Nope, nope, nope, we're not going to change a goddamn thing.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.480]  Same camera, everything. Let's just change the chip. And then if that goes well, then we'll
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.640]  then we'll start building new Mac form factors around Apple Silicon afterwards. It makes all
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:12.320]  the sense in the world. But yeah, it would be nice to have the small footprint. Now the big
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:20.080]  footprint MacBook Air 15 inches, the Apple has, in my opinion, has never made a large laptop,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.240]  I think laptops fairly can be very simplified. Let's say there's three sizes, small, medium,
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:33.040]  large, and medium is where most people are going to be. And medium is about the size footprint wise,
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:41.040]  display size wise of this MacBook Air 13 inch display, call it a 14 inch display. Now that
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.960]  the bezels are shrinking, right? Like we've gone like the MacBook Pro went from 13 to 14 inches,
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.960]  not by making it bigger, but by shrinking the bezel. And now you can say it's 14.2 inches
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.480]  instead of 13.6 inches call it 14. Well, it is also bigger. I mean, like, like I have the
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.280]  the new MacBook Air on top of the 14 inch desk right now. And the footprint of the 14 inch is
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.360]  noticeably bigger. It's it's I'd say, like a half inch bigger in both dimensions. But that did that
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:14.080]  rough but that size class is regular, right? Large is bigger. And some people like a larger laptop,
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:22.000]  you you own a 16 inch MacBook, MacBook Pro, my wife is, is a fan of the 16 inch MacBook Pro and
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.640]  was one of the fans of the 17 inch MacBook Pro back when they made it or powers downgrade her.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.120]  Yeah, she still misses the old lunch tray 17 inch PowerBook because she likes having
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.040]  a MacBook so that she can fold it up, put it away. She likes to use it in the kitchen,
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:45.360]  does not want to have an iMac in the kitchen all the time, likes having a Mac that she can close,
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:51.360]  put away, have it disappear from sight. But when she's using it once, the biggest aside from that
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.400]  the biggest display possible. Lots of people like that. But Apple's never made one. Now,
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.560]  I said this in my review, and some people pointed out that back when they had the iBooks, the G4
[01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:09.280]  iBooks, they sold I think they called 12 inch and 14 inch and that the 14 inch arguably was a big
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:18.160]  one. But I'm gonna say no, because both of both the 12 inch G4 iBook and the 14 inch G4 iBook
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:26.880]  had 1024 by 768 displays. So you didn't get more pixels, you just got bigger pixels. And sure,
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:33.440]  some people like that, right? Especially your mom had one. And those machines came out at a time
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:39.680]  when my eyes were really, really sharp. And I and the hubris of youth, I thought, why would
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:45.200]  anybody voluntarily buy a bigger, heavier one that gives you the same number of pixels? And
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:53.120]  and now that I'm older, I'm like, Oh, I know why. Because you can read. And everything looks bigger,
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:59.120]  better. And you can it's nicer to be able to read it, or read it more comfortably than not be able
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:06.080]  to read it or read it uncomfortably. But I would say that that that was a different two size option
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.320]  than what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is a bigger display that actually shows you
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.880]  more content at the default resolution. Apple's never made that at a consumer price. And one of
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.280]  the reasons I guess the reason is that Apple likes to sell expensive products. And I know there's a
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.880]  lot of people who probably they're going to leave some money on the table for some number of
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:37.440]  customers who currently just buy the MacBook Pro with the 16 inch display because they want the 16
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:43.440]  inch display, even though that's the one and only feature of the 16 inch MacBook Pro that they care
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.000]  about compared to the MacBook Air, they just want the bigger display. But they're spending,
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:56.640]  like, literally twice the money, like a new MacBook Air starts at $1,200. And the 16 inch
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:03.120]  MacBook Pro starts at $2,500. It's double the money. Now you're getting so much more. But if
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:08.640]  you don't care about any of that other stuff, all you want is a large laptop that shows you more
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:17.040]  stuff. It's absolutely it's kind of absurd and sort of one of the single, it exemplifies the
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:23.440]  limitations of being in the Mac ecosystem, where you get to choose any hardware you want, as long
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:29.040]  as it's something Apple sells you compared to the PC world, where you can find two inch thick
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:36.400]  laptops with gaming GPUs in them. You can find totally ones that are the size of a field notes
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:43.280]  notebook. I mean, you can find anything, right? I think that it's borderline, I was going to say
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:51.920]  criminal, but criminal with a lowercase c that Apple forces somebody who otherwise would be
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:58.800]  completely satisfied technically with a MacBook Air to upgrade all the way to a starts at $2,500,
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:05.920]  16 inch MacBook Pro just to get a large laptop. So yeah, and I, I think if you if you look at
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.520]  what Apple how they price the existing lineup, and now there's no more Intel, everything's a lot more
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:20.080]  under their control. And if you compare spec for spec, they actually don't charge that much more
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.000]  for screen size now. So for instance, if you look if you if you match the specs between them,
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.400]  a 14 inch to a 16 inch MacBook Pro is only about a $200 increase depends on I think it depends on
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:37.200]  certain figures, but like the way I the way I buy things, like the minimum I would buy is 16 gigs,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:44.240]  one terabyte. And that's a $200 difference right now 14 to 16. And if you do the same thing with
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:51.840]  the air, it's I think, from the air to the 14 inch, it's about $600. Now, that's not exactly
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:57.920]  the spec for spec match, because the 14 inch has the M one pro, and the air has the M two non pro.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.960]  So the the 14 inch is going to outperform it and stuff like that. And there's a nicer screen,
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.760]  the nicer speakers, like there's the other the different port situation. So there's other
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.480]  differences between the air and the 14. But when you compare them spec for spec, roughly, you're
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:20.400]  looking at 600 bucks to go from air to 14, and 200 bucks to go from 14 to 16. And so you figure like
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:28.480]  where in this lineup would a 15 inch air fit in, if it's only going to be a couple hundred bucks
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.320]  more than the regular air, then that may that would be the most logical looking at the way
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.320]  they've done this, that's most, most likely what would happen, it would be two or $300 more than
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.840]  the regular air spec for spec matched, but they would probably also not have it be available in
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.320]  as low of a configuration, just so that its starting price would then be higher. So maybe
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:54.480]  it would start at $1,600 or whatever, right? But there would still like, once you look at like,
[01:28:54.480 --> 01:29:01.600]  where it would start, there would still be probably like a $600 gap between it and the
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:06.800]  MacBook Pro 16. I know, I think it would be an $800 gap because it's 2500 for the
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:13.120]  the cheapest 16 inch MacBook Pro you can buy is $2,500. I think I think they could do it for
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:17.600]  1700. I sort of botched this. This is one of the mistakes I've got to correct in an update or not
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.000]  an update, but like a follow up piece on my MacBook Air, I just looked at base models and said,
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.600]  the 14 inch to 16 inches a $500 upgrade. But what I forgot about is that the $2,000
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:37.760]  base 14 inch MacBook Pro is chip in two ways. It only it only has an eight core CPU instead of 10,
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:45.520]  and only has a 14 core only, quote unquote, only has a 14 core GPU instead of instead of 16.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:55.840]  So if you if you and and the 16 inch MacBook Pro has no eight cores GPU or CPU or 14 core CPU
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:04.320]  options, you can only get the the true unbend and M1 Pro and M1 Macs that have 10 core
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:12.640]  and better and 16 core and better. So once you move the 14 inch MacBook Pro to 10 core CPU,
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:20.640]  16 core GPU, it's it's exactly what you said. It's only $200 difference. So the display alone is
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.640]  really only a $200 upgrade. So that would mean let's assume that a 15 inch MacBook Air would
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:34.800]  also not have any chip bend discount options. That would be the $1,500 MacBook Air with the
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.000]  how many GPUs? I forget. Well, whatever it is. No, no chip in.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.040]  Yeah, eight core CPU 10 core GPU, which I didn't even get when I for the air I just bought. I got
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:50.080]  the bin GPU because I don't care about GPU stuff. Yep. Like I will always buy all the CPU cores I
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:54.400]  can get. But I couldn't care less about GPU. So I will minimize that if I can. Yeah, I would do
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.520]  that personally, too, because I don't know. I don't know when the last time I've maxed out a GPU
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.560]  is but it's supposed to have any gray hairs at the time. So if it's only a $200 upgrade, but they
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:11.200]  don't have bend discount options, that would be $1,700. And yeah, that's right to me, man, doesn't
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:17.360]  that when you just look at the the starting prices of Isn't that seem like a gaping hole in the whole
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:24.960]  MacBook family lineup? $1,700 product? Oh, my God, that's it. And the rumors are that this fall that
[01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:31.600]  they're going to have a consumer level, it's all relative, the consumer level iPhone family is also
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.400]  going to have a large size. To date, to get the biggest iPhone, you had to get the Pro Max or
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:41.920]  whatever. And so if that's if that's true, and all the rumors seem pretty solid on that, and iPhone
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.560]  rumors like crazy by this point, so they're they can almost be treated as fact. If that's the case,
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:52.480]  then I think Apple has realized it is worth covering the market for lower priced items, even
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:56.080]  when they go into larger screens, because what they've also been doing in the meantime is pushing
[01:31:56.080 --> 01:32:03.280]  the pro prices up. But it used to be the 15 inch laptops used to start at like 1800 $2,000. And
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:07.600]  and slowly they've crept up over time. And part of that is inflation. But also part of that is
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:13.200]  Apple is pushing their pro products up market as the as they are expanding their their quote,
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:17.680]  consumer level products. And so I and I think that's a smart move. I mean, I'm not an analyst by
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.560]  any means, but they are increasingly taking market share from fortunately, the PC market sells a
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.880]  whole bunch of 13 inch laptops, and also a whole bunch of 15 inch laptops. And there is clearly a
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:36.560]  market for a bit bigger screen, but still don't care about pro stuff, pro specs, pro quality
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:41.040]  stuff like there's there's a big market for that. And it makes total sense for Apple to start
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:47.360]  addressing that market. And there is some risk of cannibalization of the higher end stuff. But I
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:52.320]  don't think it's going to be that big of a risk. I think the extra volume they're going to get is
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:58.800]  get from attacking this lower end market is going to make up for that. Right. Like the spreadsheet
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:04.960]  Tim Cook's got to be looking at is take the estimated number of people who otherwise would
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.880]  have bought a 16 inch MacBook Pro that they don't need, except they just want a big display.
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:16.880]  Yeah, and compare it to the number of people who look at those options and think, boy, I wish I
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.320]  could get a bigger one, but I'm not spending more than seventeen hundred or fifteen hundred. But
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.320]  then they see that they could just spend two hundred more and get a 15 inch and they're like,
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.440]  ah, OK, you got me. Here's my extra two hundred dollars. I'll do it. But they weren't going to
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:37.280]  upgrade from fifteen hundred to twenty five hundred. And I think you do the math. I think
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:42.560]  that Tim Cook is very happy with this solution because I think they make they they make more
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:49.200]  revenue per MacBook sold because of the vast number of people who would have just bought the
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:55.040]  13 inch MacBook Air that they kind of feel is too small for what they really wanted. But oh,
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:00.000]  for two hundred bucks. Hell yeah. Yeah. Give me give me give me the 15 inch. Yeah, totally.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.960]  They're going to sell if they if they actually make this product, they will sell a ton of them.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:10.480]  Like I have no doubt in my mind that will be a very big seller. Probably not as big as a 13 inch
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:14.720]  for lots of reasons, because it's regular, right? 13 inches is the regular size that most people
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.200]  want. But man, I think there's a lot of people who would who would go 15. Yeah. Look again,
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.120]  just look at when you when you do like back before COVID, you'd like look around an airplane
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:28.720]  or look around in an office or look around in a coffee shop. What are people using? A lot of
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:34.880]  people use 15 inch laptops. It is so they're so common. And many of them are PC laptops now.
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:38.480]  And that's that's all market just waiting to be taken here. Let me take another break. We
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.080]  still didn't get the colors, but yeah, we got to get to it. But let me take another break here.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.480]  Thanks. Here's the company. I don't know if you've heard of them. Linode. They're here in
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:51.760]  Philadelphia, actually. And Linode is a this is a great they're a hosting provider. That's actually
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:57.680]  where I host Daring Fireball. You can go to Linode dot com slash the talk show. You could see
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.560]  by going to that URL why they Linode has been voted the top infrastructure as a service provider
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.280]  by both G2 and trust radiation. New product from them. They're their database product.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.400]  They've got fully managed database services from MySQL. I think I pronounced that wrong,
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.280]  but I always call it MySQL. MySQL, I think other people pronounce it. I think every way
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.440]  you pronounce it, people are going to think you are wrong. Just different people. So you can't
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:28.640]  win. PostgresQL, PostSQL, whatever the hell they call it. Postgres. Postgres. Postgres. MongoDB.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:34.400]  It's actually Mongodba. Oh, get the hell out of here. No, it's not. You're lying to me. Don't
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:39.520]  screw with me. Redis is coming later this year. Redis, R-E-D-I-S. Well, whatever the hell,
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:45.040]  however the hell you pronounce any of these databases. It's simple and reliable managed
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:51.040]  databases. You can easily deploy high performance database clusters. Managed databases allow you to
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:57.120]  quickly deploy a new database and defer management tasks like configurations, managing high
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:04.000]  availability, disaster recovery, backups, data replication. With managed databases, you'll get
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.040]  simple and fast deployment, secure access, daily backups included, flexible plans. They kill it
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:15.760]  with hosting. I'm sure they're killing it with these managed databases. Just a phenomenal,
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:20.800]  phenomenal company. They offer the best price of performance value for all compute instances,
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:25.680]  including GPUs, as well as block storage, Kubernetes. Their upcoming, or probably it's
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:31.360]  out, bare metal release. Anyway, they make cloud computing fast, simple, and affordable.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.920]  I honestly, I never touch Daring Fireball server. I can't remember the last time I touched it. I
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.400]  mean, I log in and do stuff and SSH in and add files and do stuff. But in terms of actually
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:49.280]  managing or worrying about it or like, hey, why is my website slow? Guess what? It's never slow.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.360]  You ever notice that Daring Fireball doesn't get slow? I don't do anything. That's not me.
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:58.640]  That's because I hosted Linode. It's just a phenomenal company. Couldn't be happier with
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.920]  them. I would host Daring Fireball. If they called me up and said, hey, we've loved all
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:06.480]  these sponsorships, but we're done. Our marketing budget's gone. We're never going to sponsor you
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.680]  again. I would still recommend them to everybody who listens to me because, and I sure as hell
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:16.640]  wouldn't move my website because if it isn't broke, don't fix it. It is phenomenal. Go to
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:22.640]  Linode, L-I-N-O-D-E.com slash the talk show. You go there, you can create a free account,
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:27.520]  use your Google or GitHub account if you want to. You could just sign up with your email address.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.080]  But by going to Linode.com slash the talk show, you get 100 bucks in credit. 100 bucks.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.960]  That's like a Benjamin right in your pocket. So my thanks to Linode for continuing to sponsor
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.800]  the show. Did you ever hear of them? Oh, they're fantastic. I host all my stuff there,
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:46.480]  all my servers. I think I pay them something like $7,000 a month right now because I have
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.040]  slightly a lot of servers. Their plans start at like five or 10 bucks a month. So this is not
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.560]  saying they're expensive by any means. They are the best value in the business that I've seen.
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.120]  And I've slowly moved all of my stuff there over the last, I don't know, eight or 10 years,
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:04.240]  just because they're just better than other hosts. And you get a lot for your money there.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:11.600]  I do not spend $7,000 a month. I sure hope not. I could run your site on like a $20 instance.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.520]  That would be like one of those things where somebody's grandfather accidentally answered
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:24.000]  the wrong spam call and got suckered into a term life insurance policy, even though he's already
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.800]  87 years old. It's like, well, God, no, but anyway, great company. All right. Let's talk
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:36.800]  colors of MacBook Airs. What, what color did you get? So begrudgingly, I got silver and I'll tell
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:43.200]  you why begrudgingly. So having what, look, when those rumors came out a year or two ago that they
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.960]  were going to do the iMac colors basically, and they were going to have, the rumor was they were
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:53.920]  going to have a white keyboard, a white screen bezel, and then all the, all at the light aluminum
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:58.000]  colors that we have on the current iMacs that also kind of follow that, that white and white and
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.720]  light colors theme. And I thought, Oh my God, they're going to sell a billion of those. That's
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:08.720]  going to be amazing. It's going to be so fun and colorful and trendy, and it's going to be awesome.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.080]  And instead we got these Johnny, I have colors. It's going to, it was, it sounded like it was
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:19.280]  really going to fit our collective mood coming out of the pandemic. Yes. We're finally going to break
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.960]  out. We're going to let's buy a rainbow of computers and it would be this, this great
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.720]  groundbreaking new design and it would be awesome and light and happy and it would be great. And
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:35.120]  I, and I think, and you've said this before, and I think that what probably happened is
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.880]  a combination of Apple, I think conservatism with larger products, even though they like,
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:47.440]  they make the iPad air, which is almost as big as these, the iPad air comes in way better colors
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.160]  than these wait, like the, that nice, like kind of pale blue, the iPad air comes in. Imagine if
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:56.160]  they offer that on this computer, it would be, it would be looking, it would look amazing. And
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:02.240]  anyway, that's my review, my iPad air review unit, which I still have, is that color blue,
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:08.880]  which is what I had in mind as I wrote my MacBook air review of. Hmm. Well, here's a color that does
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.680]  seem to me like it would look pretty good. Yeah. I mean, I even, I don't know if I think it,
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:20.320]  I don't know if it's the same as the iPad air, the current iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 has a really
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:23.920]  nice blue as well. I have one of those right here. The, the blue on the side of those,
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.440]  the aluminum blue is really nice. It's a very medium blue. It's not super light, not super dark,
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:36.000]  a nice medium blue. And it looks so nice in person. And even that I think would be great on
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.240]  an air, but I think a combination of their conservatism with larger products, colors.
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.160]  And I think when they added the notch, when it, whatever part of the product development,
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.240]  whenever they decided to go with the notch, the notch can't be white. It just can't,
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:54.800]  like it would look terrible in white. And so I understand why they so, and if the notch is going
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.640]  to be black, then that means the whole screen bezel has to be black. And if the whole screen
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:03.680]  bezel has to be black, that means the keyboard has to be black. And so I see like how the,
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:11.920]  how the design then falls out from that. However, I would argue that the iPad has a notch. It has
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:17.920]  these fun colors. Every one of the phones has a notch and they have these fun colors. They also
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:25.440]  have the black bezel, the black front. So I think all of that, I don't think that precludes it from
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:33.840]  having nicer, lighter, more colorful colors. So what we have instead is kind of the three
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:37.520]  colors we already had. So silver and space gray. Yeah, they're the exact same silver and
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:44.240]  space gray we've had for a long time. No change there. Starlight is a very pale gold. It is
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:50.160]  way more pale than the outgoing MacBook Air, the M1 and prior ones where that gold was almost
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:54.720]  orange. It was like kind of pinky orange. That's the, when I, when I got the M1 MacBook Air,
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:59.120]  I got that gold because I wanted something new. Like it was a brand new architecture,
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.320]  radically different computer from the ones that came before in, in its guts and performance
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:05.280]  characteristics and everything like that. So I'm like, I don't want to just get the same old color
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:09.360]  that I've had forever. I want something new. So I got, I got the weird like pink orange kind of
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:15.920]  gold and it was kind of fun to have that for, for a year or whatever. And, and with this, I saw
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:21.920]  Starlight at the briefing and I just didn't, I couldn't, I didn't like it enough. Like Starlight
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:29.280]  is like, it's fine. It's not for me. And space gray is not for me. I, I've, I went through my
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:35.200]  phase as a nerd of buying everything black and like everything must be black. All my t-shirts
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.600]  were black. Every piece of hardware I bought that came in black was black. I was through all that.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.360]  And now I'm, I live on the beach. I'm more colorful. I'm brighter. Okay. So, so now like,
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.720]  I don't want to, I don't want like dark things anymore. Like I want nice light things, colorful
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:55.200]  things. And let's get some color in the world. We need it. And, and so silver looks awesome and it
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.080]  looks, silver is the most neutral. It matches everything. I never had that problem with
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.000]  mismatched MagSafe connectors with the M1 or the M1 Pro and Max laptops because I had silver. So
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.680]  it matched, matched everything. So that was great, but I wanted something new for the air.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:17.440]  But then midnight, midnight looks amazing until you see it in person. And when you see it in
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.480]  person, it looks, first of all, way darker than you think it is. It is almost black. And in many,
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:30.160]  in many lighting conditions, it basically looks black. So if you want a black laptop, great.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:38.160]  If you want a blue laptop, it is barely that. And secondly, even in the demo area,
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:43.520]  right in the hands-on area, even the one that Tim Cook was handling is covered in fingerprints.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:49.600]  And it is a fingerprint magnet. And I noticed that instantly. And, and they try to keep things
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.920]  pretty clean and they like wipe down the hands-on area units, like between each person usually.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:58.480]  And even then you could still see fingerprint marks on it very quickly. And you look at every
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:03.520]  single like review video of the blue one, you're going to see fingerprint marks and they might be
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:09.440]  subtle, but you will see them. And so I, I remember back when they had the black plastic MacBook in
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.240]  like 2006, I remember that had the same problem. It was, and that was a totally different finish.
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:16.800]  That was more of like a, like a, like a tacky plastic finish on that one. But
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000]  again, very similar problem of like, it, it looks great until you touch it and then it's
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.520]  covered in fingerprints. And that's how the midnight one looks to me. So a combination of
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:31.040]  me not wanting a black laptop and just wanting something a little brighter and seeing the
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:34.480]  fingerprint magnet problem on that, that made me say, no way am I getting midnight.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.040]  Tell your, tell your story of seeing the midnight. Oh yeah. Hands-on area.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.720]  I could never put my fingerprints on it. So, you know, again, in the hands-on area,
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:48.160]  so it's being mobbed by all the people who are trying to shoot videos. And that makes sense.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.240]  Even when you're in your video publication, you got to get video footage of the new product. And
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:57.440]  of course the, the midnight one is the only really new color here. Starlight technically is new,
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.200]  but it's, it's kind of boring and it's kind of in the ballpark of what we had before.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:05.680]  So midnight is the one that everybody wants footage of. Everyone wants a nice,
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.440]  good video clean shot of themselves handling the midnight one. So there's the biggest line for
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:15.360]  that. Finally, the line started to die down. So I got over and got in line. There was one guy ahead
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.000]  of me and he's handling it and I'm like, great, I'm next. All right. And then he goes away and
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:26.320]  the handler says, hold on. And they wouldn't let me come handle it. And I'm like, all right,
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:34.320]  I'll wait. No problem. And then I see the mob like shifting towards this one window.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:41.680]  Oh, Tim Cook is coming. Oh, great. Okay. And they start clearing the area around this one that I've
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:46.160]  been waiting for that I finally have just reached the front of the line for. This is the one that
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:51.040]  Tim Cook is going to handle for a photo shoot. It's so from the entrance to the right. And I've,
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:55.360]  cause I was there and I remember you could have gone to the left. If you had gone to the left,
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.480]  you would have been able to get to a midnight cause Tim Cook went to the right. See now I know
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.360]  like go far away from the entrance next to it. Yeah. But I don't think they had any midnights
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.560]  far away from the entrance. I don't know. Yeah. There weren't that many. I think there were only
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.280]  like two or three. Well, and the ones that they had, all the ones they had were the ones on the
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:18.240]  display where they showed, it was sort of like a Pac-Man mouth slowly closing. They had like,
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.080]  yeah, like the big, like parallax effect. It was cool. Right. It was a very cool thing,
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.120]  but it's like, Hey, can you take some of those down and let us play with them?
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.240]  Yeah. And no, you can't touch those. So yeah. So I had to wait and I just, and I was like,
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.400]  you know what? I'm going to stand right here. And everyone, as everyone figures out that this is
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:39.440]  where Tim Cook is coming. Everyone starts mobbing this area because they want a chance to talk to or
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:45.600]  get a picture with or touch Tim Cook. And frankly, I don't care that much about Tim. I find him very
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.920]  boring. And so I don't, I don't want to talk to Tim Cook. What am I going to say to him? So
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:54.400]  he's coming up and I couldn't care less, but I didn't want to lose my place in line. So I just
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:58.800]  stood right there and I'm in so many like weird little like B roll shots of people's YouTube
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:04.560]  videos. Like I'm just standing there like just waiting for my chance. I never got my chance
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:08.560]  because that mob never dissipated. And eventually I just gave up. I'm like, Tim Cook, he comes in,
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:15.520]  he does this and it's creepy. Like when, when he comes up, he's, he's being shot by a photographer
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:21.920]  across the room with a long lens. And so he comes up and starts handling the laptop very slowly.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:26.640]  And he starts moving the cursor in a circle on the track pad doing nothing. And he starts typing
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.160]  random letters on the keyboard, but like, there isn't even a notes window open. He's just typing
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:34.640]  letters with the desktop open. So it just, it looks, and he's just staring intently at it.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.720]  He just, cause you know, he's done this before. He's a pro. He knows he's being photographed and
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.320]  he has to look like he's using it. And when you see the other side of it, when you're actually
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:47.520]  seeing what he's doing, it's just, it's so weird. And it's like inhuman almost. You're like, what?
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:54.160]  Like this is so weirdly faked. Like it's a very uncomfortable thing to watch. And he's, he's very,
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:00.480]  he's always very controlled. He's, he never is off script. He, he's never seemingly like
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:06.160]  improving anything. He is always very controlled and seemingly planned out how he's going to be.
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.800]  And so he, he is a machine when he's doing this thing. He, you can't get him to crack a smile.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.280]  You can't get him to break whatever character he wants to be. Like he is doing his thing and
[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:20.560]  everyone's yelling, Tim, hey, Tim, they're yelling questions at him and stuff. And, and he is just
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:26.960]  doing it. And it's, it's very strange. I, somebody, I forget if I, if I heard it personally,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:33.440]  or if I got this from ATP, when you told the story there, somebody, some kook yelled, Tim,
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.640]  are we living in a simulation? Oh yeah, that was, yeah, that was, I told you that. Yeah. But I mean,
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:44.080]  it was, I, I've been going to these things for a long time now. I think I can call myself a veteran
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.800]  of these hands-on areas. I mean, cause my time doing them goes all the way back to the end of
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:54.720]  the Steve Jobs era. It's gotten weird. This one, and I don't know, I don't know if it's because
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.880]  the hands-on area was in that upstairs atrium at the Steve Jobs theater, as opposed to the
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:07.520]  downstairs area, which is meant for hands-on areas. But I think it was a sort of a COVID
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.640]  type thing. It's like, let's keep it closer to the open air. Like, cause you didn't even get to
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.360]  go downstairs, right? No, it was only upstairs. Yeah. So like some of the, the, those of us who
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:23.040]  had like briefings went downstairs for the briefings, but that even when I did go downstairs
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.160]  for the briefing, they had like coffee and water and stuff, not crowded at all. And they had no
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:36.880]  products at all in the mingling area. That was the biggest sort of celebrity paparazzi scrum around
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:44.640]  Tim Cook I've ever seen. It, it honestly felt a little dangerous. I, I, I really wonder whether
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:50.480]  his, in hindsight, I don't know how much, like, what does Apple capture? What do their
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:54.800]  photographers, are they just shooting stills? Do they shoot video of the whole thing? Do they have
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.840]  security footage? I bet they have security cameras. I wouldn't be surprised if the security
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:04.640]  people around Tim Cook look at that and think we have to do this differently the next time because
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.800]  it, well, I don't know, because one of the reasons this was so amusing to me is that
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:14.640]  almost the exact same thing happened in 2019 in San Jose WDC when they were, when they had like
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:21.760]  the new Mac Pro. And the moment I was looking at the new Mac Pro happened to be the moment that
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:27.280]  Johnny Ive and Tim Cook came in for their photo shoot where Johnny was like explaining the design
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.280]  of the holes in the front of the case to Tim Cook and like, and they were doing that photo shoot.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:37.600]  And that was also similarly awkward and weird to be very close for. And again, I mean, I,
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.520]  I know these people have fans. I think it's super ironic that these people who I don't really care
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.000]  for, I keep getting very close to as everyone else is trying to mob and I'm just like standing there
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.040]  where they happen to be going. I, I'm, I'm going to look it up and I swear to God, I'll put it
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:59.040]  in the show right now for this chapter. I'm 96% sure that I personally have a photo from that
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:06.320]  event of you, Tim and Johnny in the frame. I was right there like it. And I think I have my own
[01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.200]  photo, so I don't have to license it from Getty or anything. I've got one and it is amusing because
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:18.160]  you're just bemused and, and Johnny and Tim are playing. And again, I'm, I'm, it's funny and we're
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:22.720]  laughing at them, but I don't blame them because what else are they going to do? But their shtick
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:31.840]  for that whole era was okay. Now Johnny Ive shows this to Tim as though it's the first time Tim Cook
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.800]  has ever seen it. Right. Or had, and he's explaining, Oh, here's how we drill up these holes.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:43.280]  But Tim Cook, all right. A, Tim Cook, obviously, I mean, again, he's famously not a product designer.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:50.480]  He doesn't pretend to be, but he is obviously, he's not a hands off CEO, right? He's not a
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:56.000]  micromanager who pretends that he can design these products or that he's going to put input into how
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:01.680]  big the holes should be drilled or what color the aluminum should be. Damn well that he's aware of
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:10.400]  every thing about these products and, and 60 minutes prior to the moment of Johnny showing him,
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:15.360]  you know, look at here is where we put, here's where we put the camera. Tim Cook was literally
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:23.840]  on stage introducing the damn thing. He was the emcee of the show. I do think it's kind of funny
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:29.200]  though. Like when, when they are, when, you know, and Tim to his credit, like even though he is
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.760]  extremely controlled when he's actually doing like whatever the little skit or interaction is
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:40.880]  that he's doing for the photo op on his way in, he is very generous with giving people selfies
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.120]  and stuff like that. He will, he will answer random questions that are shouted to him.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:49.920]  He will stop and take selfies with almost everybody who, who attempts it with him.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:53.120]  Like he, and that's one of the reasons it takes him forever to actually get to the place he's
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:56.800]  going because he is stopping and talking to everybody who wants to talk to him. He,
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.720]  he is very generous in that way. And I have to give him credit for that. That being said,
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:07.120]  I mean, look, I know maybe I'm more critical of the guy, but like, he's not that charismatic. Like,
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:12.320]  who is that big of a fan of Tim Cook? Like he's a business guy doing business guy things.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:19.680]  Do people, like, why do people, why are people that excited to see him? Like, I understand when
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:23.520]  Steve was in charge, Steve's a very charismatic guy. Like that was, that was a whole different
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:30.000]  ballgame. Tim is, is not that kind of public person. What, what is the appeal that people
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.800]  have that they want to like mob him? I don't know. It is interesting. I will say this though,
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.560]  that the, the Steve Jobs, I mean, Apple was a different company when Steve Jobs was still alive
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:46.960]  and it's just much, much smaller. And yes, the tail end of Steve Jobs life was the beginning
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:55.040]  of the iPhone era and the iPhone era was like a big bang explosion of increased popularity and
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:02.640]  interest in the company. Right. But the Steve Jobs era hands on things were so chill and there
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:07.680]  were just fewer media, whether it was because of the interest was lower or whether they just
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:14.000]  kept a tighter list of how many people got invited. The video era hadn't really started
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.640]  and there were far, far, far fewer people trying to shoot video in the hands-on areas.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:25.040]  I mean, there were photographers, but it was much more. It felt like most of the photographers
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.440]  were from major publications, like just a handful, like the New York times would send a photographer,
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:38.240]  but that most of the people shooting photos were just people like me or the,
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:43.680]  like the staff from the verge. It's, it's Neelay Patel shooting photos, not a photographer.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:51.360]  And it just, Jobs never, ever got mobbed like that. And he never did the pantomime. I'm going
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:56.000]  to pretend to see the device for the first time. He would just walk through the hands-on era area
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.520]  and spent no time playing with the products. None. All he would do, it was him and always,
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:08.800]  and always of course, Katie Cotton and Katie Cotton just sort of, I didn't, I tried not to be
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.960]  creepy. I don't think I got creepy, but I got, I was like fascinated by the dynamic of how Steve
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:20.480]  Jobs would work this room and the way it always worked was he'd come through. If he saw someone
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:26.240]  who he knew and wanted to talk to well, Katie would pick up on that and just let him go.
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:29.840]  Whether it was somebody else from Apple, like, Hey, there's Scott Forstall. And
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.640]  Steve has something to say to Scott Forstall. He'd just go over and talk to him or Steve sees
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.080]  Walt Mossberg. He'd just go over and start talking to Walt because he knew him.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:44.160]  But for the most part, then he'd wander around. And, and as he'd approached somebody, Katie would
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.720]  know who Katie Cotton would know who she wanted him to talk to. And she would say, this is so and
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:54.080]  so from the New York Times whispered in his ear. And then he, then he, he wouldn't, he'd know,
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.320]  know the name. And then he would just always say the same thing, which Tim Cook does too.
[01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.440]  If you do talk to him, which I've done a handful of times, just the same question every time.
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:09.680]  So what'd you think? Which is great if you think about it, right? Steve, Steve Jobs knows what the
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.000]  fuck he thinks of the new iPhone 3G8 4 or whatever the hell is coming out. He knows what he thinks.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.400]  He knows what you think. So what'd you think? And then there's the opener. And then the person
[01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:23.920]  would say it. And then, and then very quickly, Katie Cotton would be the bad, bad, bad guy and
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:28.320]  say, we've got, we have to move. And then she'd say, Hey, here's a so-and-so from USA Today. And
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:32.240]  that's how he'd work the room. Just talk to some press. And then I don't know. I never saw him
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.840]  leave. It was one of those, it was like a magician. It's like, I don't know. He was there. He was
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:39.520]  walking around. Everybody was like, Ooh, Ooh, there's Steve. But the other thing is that Steve
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:45.520]  Jobs had sort of a, a Darth Vader-ishness to him. Like he's scary, right? Like people.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.680]  Yeah. You wouldn't, you wouldn't just like run up to him.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:51.360]  No, no. Walt Mossberg might, but he wouldn't have to run. Right. He would just,
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:55.120]  he's fucking Walt Mossberg and they know each other and they'd be like, oh, Walt, what'd you
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:58.960]  think? If I saw Steve walk, if I was in one of those areas, which I never was when he was alive,
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.440]  but if I, when I was in one of those areas, if Steve walked by, the last thing I would do would
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.520]  be to walk towards him. I would be like, Oh my God. Like, am I, it'd be like, like, do you,
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.160]  like, there's the protocol. You don't touch the queen. Like, like what, what's the protocol with
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.960]  Steve? Do I, do I look at him? Do I pretend like he's not there? Do it like, do I say hello? Do I
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:20.880]  wait for him? Like he must talk to me. I don't talk to him. Like that's, that's how it would
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.760]  feel. You'd know it without even seeing him. You'd feel it like the force. So you'd be like, whoa,
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:29.520]  whoa, why the hairs on my neck standing up? Holy shit. Steve Jobs is coming towards me.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:34.160]  And like you said, you'd be like, I better, I better move further away. Right. Yeah. It is a
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.040]  very different era. I mean, and I don't know, like in the alternate world where Steve Jobs
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:43.920]  never got sick or stayed, stayed ahead of the cancer and, and had been around for a decade
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:49.840]  longer or, or wouldn't it be wonderful if he was still here? Uh, what would he do? I don't know.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.120]  I, I, I refuse to believe he ever would have played the game where Johnny Ive pretends to
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.280]  show him the thing for the first time, but maybe, maybe they would just never would have taken a
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:03.840]  selfie with random people in the, in the area. I don't know. I don't think so. I really don't.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:08.080]  Yeah. I don't think so because he, he got in and got out and I don't think he, I don't,
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:13.920]  I just don't think he had patience like Tim Cook does. I think Tim Cook, one of his many, many,
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:19.520]  many genius level gifts is I think he has genius level of patience because I don't know if I were
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.400]  Tim Cook. There's no frigging way that when I visit a random Apple store, because I'm in
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:30.160]  New York or Atlanta or wherever I am, that I would spend 90 minutes greeting people and taking
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:34.720]  selfies and stuff like that. I don't know. I mean, I love meeting people. Don't, don't get me wrong.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:39.280]  But like when I meet people at WWDC, it takes me five minutes. It's not Tim Cook.
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:42.400]  Well, in all fairness, we have fewer people who want to meet us in that way.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.280]  Well, right, right. It's like if I had the level of attention and the number of people who
[01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:50.960]  wanted to get, take a selfie with me that Tim Cook did, I would have to have somebody say,
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:55.760]  you got to get me away from these people. It's, it's unbelievable. I have not seen Midnight
[01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:00.720]  again because I haven't been to an Apple store. I only, I, so the last time I saw it was WWDC.
[01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:07.040]  I love it because I wish Apple made a black or near black MacBook Pro. I, the one thing that
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:12.080]  makes me jealous when I go on airplanes is the way people with high-end ThinkPads, and it's always
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:17.520]  and it's always been the case. I, I think they look great. I thought that the last time Apple's
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:23.680]  Mac laptops looked great was when the power books were black and, you know, that, I mean,
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:28.240]  that's ancient history at this point. Oh, wow. I think that's a great look. I just, I'm boring.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:34.400]  I like dark stuff. My favorite iPhone color of all time was the, I forget what color they called it.
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:40.800]  Just the black of the iPhone 7? No, the one, it was the iPhone 5 where they had the bezel and it
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:45.680]  wore off over the course of the year, right? Because it's like in a way that like blue jeans
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:50.720]  look better after you've washed them a couple of times. People complained about the black wearing
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:55.200]  off where you touched it on like the iPhone 5, but I thought it looked awesome. I thought it was
[01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:03.840]  like the Millennium Falcon looking aged in a cool way, but I did also like the black iPhone 7s. I had
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:07.520]  a devil of it. That was the only time I've ever had a really hard time picking what to buy,
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:11.600]  jet black. Remember they had jet black and regular black? Yeah, and yeah, and Phil Schiller was just
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:16.640]  black. Very odd, but I could see why they had both, which seems really odd because they both
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.800]  looked awesome. So I would look... Jet black was amazing. I still have it. It's right here in the
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:24.240]  drawer over here. I still have it. And this is, I finally have to retire it as my testing phone
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.560]  because iOS 16 doesn't work on it. Yeah, it was a hell of a thing. So I liked that, but I have
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:34.960]  to admit with, I have to agree with your assessment. Midnight on the MacBook Air looks like
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:42.560]  black or near black with a slightly, oh yeah, it is sort of bluish in certain light from certain
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:50.640]  angles. It is way more black or near black with a slight blue tint than blue than like a dark blue
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:55.680]  or something like that. I also think, like in my review, cause I got starlight as my review unit,
[02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:01.520]  which seemed like a weird, some kind of weird backstory where I'm not picky with review units.
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:07.520]  I sometimes would rather be surprised. And I also, with review units, like to get colors that I know
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:13.120]  I don't want myself to buy, but they were like, what color would you like? And I said, well,
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.640]  as always, you know, whatever you want to send me, you can send me. But if you want my order,
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:24.320]  I would pick midnight, then starlight, then silver, then space gray. Space gray lasts because
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:29.200]  I've been buying space gray MacBooks for a year, ever since they've had them now. So what do I
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:33.040]  need to see that for? And then they said, okay. And I was supposed to get midnight. And then like
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.960]  a day before it was supposed to ship, they're like, ah, you know what? We can't send midnight.
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.640]  Is that okay? And I'm like, yeah. And they're like, we'll send you starlight. I'm like, okay,
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:46.080]  that's cool. So I got starlight. So I don't know, maybe they had like some kind of fewer
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:50.720]  midnights available for reviewers than they expected. And they sent them to people like
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:57.280]  iJustine and MKBHD. Yeah. Video people where it matters a lot more. I would do the same thing.
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.040]  I didn't. The only photo I've published in my review was the one showing how with the lids
[02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:11.280]  closed side by side with the 14 inch MacBook Pro, that the entire new MacBook Air is the same height
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.560]  as just the bottom part of the MacBook Pro. Like if you just snap the lid off the 14 inch
[02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:22.640]  MacBook Pro, now they're the same thickness. That's one photo. Obviously, iJustine and MKBHD
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:30.560]  combined ran up like 20 million views or more of their reviews with super high quality professional
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:35.840]  video. So yeah, send them the midnight. My take on starlight using it is I kept forgetting it's so
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:41.760]  to me, I kept forgetting it was starlight. I kept thinking as I was using it with no other devices
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:49.600]  side by side, I kept thinking it was sort of like ambient warm color temperature. Like, yeah. Oh,
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:55.280]  the sun went down. Now I'm looking at incandescent light in my house. Oh yeah, no, no. This is
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:02.560]  starlight. This is actually gold. The problem with starlight is that it is kind of a slightly
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:08.960]  white balanced to warm version of silver. And the problem is then it won't match anything else on
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:14.720]  your desk that's silver. It won't. It definitely won't. But it's close. So it doesn't look like
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.520]  a choice. It looks like a mismatch, like a mistake. So like, you know, I have other stuff, you know,
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:24.960]  I have the produce play XDR. It's its foot of its stand is silver. I have next to it a headphone
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:29.200]  amp. It's silver. Like if you have any other Apple products in your life, chances are they're
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.880]  silver. And my keyboard is black. And it's like, if you have any other silver aluminum,
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:38.320]  any other any other aluminum that is not colored in some way, so it's a silver,
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:44.080]  it will not match the starlight. And that's very frustrating because it's like, it's close.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:48.560]  So it just looks like a mistake. Whereas if it's a color, like like more colorful color,
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:54.240]  a more saturated blue, red, whatever, like that would look like an intentional difference. Whereas
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:04:00.080]  starlight looks like just Oh, I forgot to white balance this one thing. Yeah, it's not like Apple
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:05.680]  hasn't done bolder colors before. I would say that the older gold ones that they called gold
[02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.000]  definitely were more gold, but they were also because they were called gold and looked gold
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.160]  were more striking. And the rose gold ones, particularly so I would say the closest they've
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:21.840]  ever gotten to a fun aluminum MacBook Color would be the rose gold. Not Yeah, not for me,
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.200]  I wouldn't buy rose gold. But it was a very striking color. And people I know who bought
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.960]  them loved it and way more fun than any of the colors they're offering now. I mean, one thing
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:38.400]  I think you'd probably agree with me every programmer I've ever known, sort of gets annoyed
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:45.920]  when they get bug reports that include the solution. Right? Or Why don't you just Yeah,
[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:51.200]  why don't you just say I think it would be easy to blank. Oh, boy, that's most of the programmers.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:56.800]  A lot of my good friends and your friends, too, are programmers. And I like logical people. I'm
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:01.920]  a nerd. I have a computer science degree. I invented markdown a long time ago and wrote
[02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:07.280]  wrote the reference implementation. I understand programming. Can't call myself a programmer now,
[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.200]  other than like as a hobbyist. But I get it. But every programmer I know, and in addition to me
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.960]  liking them being logical people, they're also good. They just tend to be in my experience,
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:25.280]  good natured people there. Because it's just the way their brains work. It matches with me. But if
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:31.680]  you want to set them off, tell them something is going to be easy. When you don't have the source
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:38.400]  code, right? I think it would be easy if you just add blank, right? Oh, boy, you can. Oh,
[02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:43.440]  you can really set off an even keeled. I bet you could even piss off underscore. If you told him
[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:50.880]  something was easy. You maybe Well, not him. Maybe he's a rock. But no, you if I had if I had to try
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:56.640]  to piss off David underscore Smith by it somehow, that would be my try. I would try to tell him that
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:02.240]  something was easy. It probably would fail. You're right. But it's the best guess I have. But in that
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:07.440]  vein, rather than tell Apple what color they should make laptops like they should make a
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:15.520]  product red, bright red MacBook Air, or they should make the the blue from the the the iPad Air.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.440]  I don't even if I don't even go there. I would just say, if I had a you want to take my face,
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:27.200]  I'll just describe my problem or the problem I perceive you figure it out. I think the problem
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:35.360]  is there should be fun colors. Yes. And you figure out what colors would be fun. That would work on a
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:41.360]  laptop and work with a black keyboard and a black notch and therefore a black bezel. You figure it
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:46.000]  out. But I think they should be fun. None of these colors are fun. Yeah. And if you look like if you
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:52.560]  look at again, the iPad Air is a great counter example. Like the iPad Air has the same materials,
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:57.520]  the same black bezel, like you could see how you get a rough idea of how things would look if you
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:03.760]  look at the iPad Air. That's the closest we have. And the iPad Air colors are just barely fun. Like
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:09.280]  in absolute terms, the iPad Air colors are like, we had boring silver and somebody spilled a bit
[02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:13.520]  of fun into the mix. But it was more of an accident. Like that's the iPad Air colors.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:19.040]  And they look pretty great, even considering that the extremely restrained amount of fun that Apple
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:25.760]  barely showed here. The the MacBook Air is bought by so many different types of people.
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:30.800]  And I think they would really appreciate a fun option. And I think like in the same way,
[02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:35.280]  like when the when the new iMac 24 inch came out with all of its fun colors.
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:41.520]  That computer was probably before that was probably the most boring computer in Apple's
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:48.400]  lineup. Who ever talked about the small screened iMac before that? No one ever like maybe in the
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:52.640]  90s when it first came out when it was the only one ever since there's been like two sizes of iMac.
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:58.560]  Who ever talked about the low end mid sized or small one? No one. It was the most boring product
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:03.920]  in the lineup who buys small desktops, not that many people anymore who buys desktops,
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:09.920]  not that many people anymore. But they came out the door with this nice new redesign that had
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:15.680]  radical new color options. And everyone was talking about it. And it became the cool thing.
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:18.960]  And everyone was saying, Hey, I wonder if I can fit a desktop into my life again, because this is
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:25.520]  just so cool. I want to buy one because it looks so cool. Like, I hope at some point they do that
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.960]  for the laptop line. Because even though the laptop line doesn't need the help in sales,
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.880]  it's obviously it's gonna sell it crazy, even if it looks even if it just looks very, very boring.
[02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.880]  But I think people want that fun. And so maybe that's maybe that's something they do to help
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:42.480]  drive sales of the smaller one, if they ever make it or the bigger one, if they ever make it,
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:48.800]  who knows, but I think I really hope they do this at some point. And again, maybe maybe it's a COVID
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:52.320]  thing. Maybe this is next year's update kind of thing, as you've been speculating. I think that's
[02:08:52.320 --> 02:09:00.720]  those are all great theories. I just hope they do it. Because we've had silver and gray and black
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:06.880]  computers for a long time now. And we don't need more of those as the only options. It's great to
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.800]  have those for all the people who who want a neutral, boring, or dark looking computer like
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:17.440]  we it's good to have those options. A lot of people want that. But that's not everybody.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:23.440]  And Apple is the only company that would that would do a good job of colorful options. And I
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:28.880]  really hope that they sometimes do. I wonder if it's a COVID type thing. I spitballed in my review
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:35.200]  that maybe it's just, I do expect I expect this form factor. I mean, maybe not the exact dimensions,
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:40.560]  but the basic idea of how it looks to be that I would expect at least 10 years. I mean, that's
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.880]  how long I think this will be what the MacBook Air looks like. Because that's how long that the
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.840]  wedge was. And that's a long time. And when you're thinking we don't think about we're all thinking
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:54.000]  like this right now. It's brand new. I just had I've only had it for like two weeks, or you've
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.640]  only had it for like 48 hours. And it's new and exciting. And Oh, I wish I had other colors.
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:03.920]  Whereas the people at Apple who are planning this out, no, they may not think for sure,
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:07.120]  this will be the same in eight years, but they might think that's probably going to
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.960]  be and they're all definitely already thinking one, two, maybe even three years ahead. And so
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.600]  maybe all the people at Apple who know such things, or if they're listening, they're like,
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:22.560]  Oh, my God, if you only knew the fun colors we have coming, it's sort of like the way the M1
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.280]  rolled out in the most boring form factors possible machines that looked exactly like
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:32.320]  the Intel ones. Now they've got the new form factor, which in it of itself is exciting.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:38.640]  So why burn up exciting colors? And then next year, we start seeing exciting colors. Maybe,
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:44.000]  I hope I don't know, maybe I'm just talking myself into believing that. But I also do wonder if
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.840]  there's a COVID supply chain thing to it. Because in some sense, it doesn't make any sense that they
[02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:57.520]  have more colors of the 24 inch iMac than they do the MacBook Air when we know the MacBook Air is
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.600]  by far and away the most popular Mac they make. It seems like if any of them was going to get
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:08.960]  the most color options, it would be the MacBook Air, whatever those colors are. So I don't know.
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.840]  I wonder if to like lending credence to the supply chain theory. This MacBook Air was originally
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:21.920]  rumored to come out this past spring. And instead, it came out in mid July. Yep. And and also, we
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:28.080]  know that this is a very important product for back to school. Yep. And tons of people buy these
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:33.520]  to send their kids off to college. Yep. I wonder if like maybe part of the way it maybe supply
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:38.320]  chain stuff or other delays happened that made it very challenging to get this product out on time.
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.320]  And that one of the ways they could get it out on time was just to make the colors very boring.
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.480]  I think it's it's almost uncomfortably late for back to school. And I didn't understand this
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:53.200]  until I was a parent. Because if you're not, you might think, well, why in the world would early
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:58.080]  July be late for back to school, but John Siracusa's son, just like mine heading off to
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:04.400]  college in the fall, his son was due for a new one. So he, John Siracusa was waiting for them
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:08.960]  to go on sale. And as soon as they went on sale bought, right, it's it is time, now's the time
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:14.880]  for kids who are going to college to get there. It was June was the time for them to get them.
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:20.400]  Right. And so July is actually late. My son, Jonas, doesn't need a new MacBook. He got a
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:28.000]  MacBook Pro a year ago, the M1 13 inch. So he doesn't need one. But all of it. I have never
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.920]  been more popular amongst my son's friends for what I do. Then this summer on the, hey,
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:38.480]  my friends, somebody else is wondering what whether they should wait for the MacBook Air
[02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:42.640]  because they need a machine for a new they're getting a new laptop for college. And I'm like,
[02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:47.360]  Yes, I don't have it yet. But this is me weeks ago. I don't have it yet. I can't vouch for it.
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:51.280]  But I would say yes, wait, and I will let you know as soon as I have it. I'll give it the thumbs up.
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.960]  But his friends are wait, we're waiting for the MacBook Air to come out. And if it had been out
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:03.280]  earlier, they would have bought it earlier. Yeah. So hopefully, this is one of the things like,
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.800]  when you when you look back into past years with the knowledge of future products, you can kind of
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:12.800]  figure out like, Okay, well, this is why this happened, or Oh, this, this was clearly waiting for this.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.200]  So hopefully, in whatever, whenever the next version of the MacBook Air is updated, maybe
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:23.040]  if there's an M3 version in a year and a half or something, hopefully, that we it will become more
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:28.640]  obvious what the what the strategy here is with the colors and, and I hope there's more of them,
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:34.880]  and they aren't just different shades of gray, and a very, very, very dark blue. So it's almost black.
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:39.440]  I just changed the color temperature on silver. And now it's now it's yeah, right now it's
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.240]  such champagne or whatever they're going to call the next version of starlight a special bonus
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:48.960]  extra sponsor. I think they're new. I should check my notes. I think they're a new sponsor.

[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:36.400]  was I was telling my wife earlier, like, like, I have a podcast to do tonight. But I don't have
[02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:43.040]  to do any prep for it. And I don't have to do any editing for it. So it's just the fun part.
[02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:47.280]  It's great. I don't mind. I don't mind. But it is a pleasure when I do somebody else's podcast. It's
[02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:52.000]  like, Hey, that is a lot easier. Yeah, right. Before we leave the MacBook Air, there's the
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:59.120]  mini scandal over the read write performance of the SSD in the low end configuration.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:06.000]  The long story short, if you get the cheapest MacBook Air, it has 256 gigabytes of storage.
[02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:15.120]  And the way they do the storage and all these is with 256 gigabyte NAND storage units. So the 256
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:24.800]  total model only has one actual SSD chip. All the other ones like if you get a 512, it has two 256
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:31.920]  SSD chips, and therefore can read and write to them in parallel and you get higher performance
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:38.880]  because there's two chips. And I guess with the M1 MacBook Air, even the low end configuration
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:46.720]  256 was actually two 128 gigabyte chips. So all of them worked in parallel. And there was apparently
[02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:54.880]  no read write hit with the M1 MacBook Air. To me, this is like, Oh, that sounds interesting. Is this
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.640]  really a thing? And then I actually looked at the numbers. I don't have a 256 gigabyte model. My
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:08.160]  review unit is one terabyte. But I've read a bunch about this. I honestly I think that this is way
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:15.760]  overblown. And I think that the claims that it's like a 50% reduction in read speeds. I that's
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:22.080]  nonsense. I don't think that adds up in the real world. I think it's one benchmark app, the black
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:29.200]  magic, whatever, whatever suggests it's 50%. But I everything I've seen people try to do with them
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:35.120]  in the real world, like exporting video and stuff. There's like 20% slower or something like that,
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:43.040]  which makes sense. And it's still faster, I think, than the M1 or not in all ways. But I mean,
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:47.760]  the thing is, like, it's this is, if you're looking at like this, the speed of the SSD
[02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:52.400]  relative to total system performance, the differences we're talking about here are going
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:59.680]  to be pretty much unnoticeable in almost every way at almost all the time. This is a very
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:03.680]  unimportant metric relative to the two numbers that we're talking about here, like whether
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.120]  you're comparing to the M1, where like it's a little bit slower in certain ways a little
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:12.080]  bit faster in other ways, or whether you're comparing the the one chip 256 gig model to
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.280]  the two chip all other storage models. Yeah, it is going to be slower on certain benchmarks.
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.440]  If you if you're actually going to notice that is that's a different question. And if you think
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:29.120]  you even might notice that you probably aren't getting the 256 gig gigabyte gigabyte model in
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:35.360]  the first place, because that is not a lot of space. And anybody who is at all concerned
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:42.480]  about the resource levels of these computers don't get 256 it is too small, get at least 512.
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:48.640]  Yeah, like and and anybody who is doing anything intensive, that anything like a video processing
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:55.600]  kind of workflow probably can't fit in 256 anyway. So I think this is whenever Apple does anything,
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:01.440]  there is a large industry of which we are both apart, that benefits from the attention that
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.280]  anybody can get if we can drum up some kind of problem with it. And we can say, Oh, there's a
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.800]  scandal the keyboards break. That's one thing that we remember the iPhones bending. Yeah, God,
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.240]  that was so stupid. But and almost all of these scandals are rooted in something that is true,
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:20.880]  but not important. Like, yes, the iPhone, I believe it was the iPhone six. Yeah, the iPhone
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:26.800]  six and six plus, they actually could bend more easily, you might guess it wasn't great. It was
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:32.480]  not good. But it but it also didn't matter for almost any right. And that's how this is. This
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:37.360]  is a real thing. The SSD is slower in certain benchmarks in certain configurations than it was
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:43.200]  before. Whether anyone's going to actually ever notice that and whether it matters is a very
[02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:49.680]  different question. And the answer is pretty much no. And and again, I urge you do not get
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:58.640]  256 if you care, like if you can at all get more get more if you if you cannot in any way afford
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:03.680]  to upgrade to the 512 and the M two MacBook Air, don't get the M two MacBook Air get the M one
[02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:09.040]  model and upgrade it to 512 for overall like the same or less. Yeah, because that that is how much
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:13.920]  that matters. You don't want to do six you want 512. So yeah, it sucks. They couldn't make this
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:18.720]  the same across all the storage configurations. But overall, this doesn't really matter. This is
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:24.960]  not a thing. Yeah. And I would say this even as me personally being a big fan of bumping up the RAM,
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:30.320]  if you can, if you can only bump one thing up, you're way better off bumping the storage to 512
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:37.440]  staying with the base eight gigabytes of RAM. And then with the 512 and this the full speed SSD and
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:43.200]  the way the all of Apple's SSDs, including the 256 one are very fast, high quality storage.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:49.360]  When when your Mac swaps, it'll it'll be fine. And you won't notice. I've tested the eight gigabyte
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:53.760]  one at some point with one of them one once and it's like, I can't believe I'm going to use eight
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:59.440]  gigabytes. I have 100 Safari tabs. Nope, it was fine. Because the SSD is so fast. But you want
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:04.640]  that SSD to be fast and you want room for it to swap. So yes, if you can only upgrade one thing,
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:09.760]  upgrade the storage to fuck to 512. Yeah, like the swap swap profiling and everything like
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:14.080]  it, you don't realize how fast the M one is at things. And it's not like swapping to hard drives
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:20.720]  back in the day, like when, when the M ones first came out, I switched my desktop from an iMac Pro
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:28.080]  with 64 gigs of RAM to a MacBook Air and one with 16 gigs of RAM. And I use that like that for most
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:35.600]  of the year. And I noticed I like I wanted more RAM. And I did notice like the amount I mean,
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:42.480]  I'm driving, I was driving an XDR off his MacBook Air, running Xcode and Photoshop and logic and all
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:48.720]  these all these big apps. And I'm, I am not a good person at like, I'm gonna do one thing in full
[02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:54.080]  screen mode and close all my other apps and keep a minimal desktop. Nope, that is not me at all.
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:59.440]  I always have tons of crap running tons of huge apps taking up tons of memory that I don't close,
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:02.640]  I just hide them and move move on to something else. And I'll switch back in a few minutes.
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:07.840]  So I have tons of stuff going on. I use a bunch of RAM. And so for a while I had the 16 gig,
[02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:12.720]  which was really not enough for what I was doing. And I didn't really feel as much as I thought I
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:18.400]  would like when I when I had the opportunity to buy more when the M1 Pro and Max ones came out,
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:23.200]  I did. I'm back up to 64 now because I could say these same here because I'm an idiot.
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:29.600]  I but I love having too much RAM. 64 gigabytes of RAM is too much for me. It's more than I need.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:34.640]  But that's what I want. That's it. Yeah, I want a car right now. I want a car about 28. I want
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:40.400]  a car that can go way faster than I could possibly keep on the road. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like right
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:45.280]  now my desktop, I'm using 28 gigs of RAM. I don't have Xcode or logic open. This is just like my
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:49.520]  everything else crap stuff. I've recently did have all that stuff open. I have all these web browser
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:53.680]  tabs. I have different apps to help me out doing different things. So I got a lot of stuff going on
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:57.760]  28 gigs when I'm actually doing programming work. It probably goes up a little bit more than that.
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:05.280]  But either way, like 16, I was swapping with 16. And I didn't notice it a lot of the time,
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:11.040]  I did notice it a little bit. But it wasn't as much as I would have guessed, based on previous
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.440]  systems that didn't have enough RAM, like back in the Intel days. And especially if you go back to
[02:23:15.440 --> 02:23:18.960]  the hard drive days, that's a very different ballgame then obviously, but it's like two
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:25.680]  ballparks over. Oh, at least that's a planet over SSDs now are so fast. And the M1 and M2 subsystems
[02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:30.320]  and bandwidth in all the different parts of the chip and the IO and everything. It's just so fast
[02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:36.720]  now that when you do have to swap, it's not ideal, obviously, but you notice it a lot less than you
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:40.560]  used to. So yeah, going back to the original point of this question, I would say, yeah,
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:43.920]  if you have to upgrade one thing, upgrade the SSD before you upgrade the memory.
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:49.520]  All right, last topic, Johnny Ive. So it's in the news. It's not like out of the blue,
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.640]  but it one of the bits of news from earlier this month was a trip mickle scoop for the New York
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:24:00.080]  Times, which is fascinating to me because I don't think anybody's, either Apple or
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:06.320]  Johnny Ive and Love From are really pleased with his recent book, but he got the scoop that the
[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:13.040]  Johnny Ive stepped down as chief design officer 2019 and is immediately upon that announcement
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:17.280]  was also announced that he's forming a new design company called Love From and that Love From's
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:22.800]  first customer would be Apple and that Apple looked forward to years of collaboration,
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:29.360]  continuing collaboration with Johnny Ive now at Love From and now we're three years later
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:34.240]  and according to Trip Mickle and it seems true because that was like two weeks ago or a week
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:39.920]  and a half ago and we've heard nothing since to correct it. So I'm going to say this is now
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:45.840]  considered factual, even though to my knowledge, neither Apple nor Love From has confirmed it on
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:52.080]  the record. That's over or is about to be over. That's the story. The question is, what does it
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:25:01.760]  mean, right? And you have strong opinions on late era Johnny Ive's influence on Apple's products and
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:09.360]  I think I largely agree with you but subtly disagree with you. And that's fair. I mean, look,
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:16.240]  I was very happy to see him go. I think he had an amazing run and did some amazing work there and I
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:25.280]  also think towards the end, he clearly both seemed burnt out and less interested in continuing there
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:31.840]  and also I think in the post-Steve era, I think he lost an important editor and collaborator and
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:39.760]  the work showed that. I think he gained way more power in Steve's absence than I think was good
[02:25:39.760 --> 02:25:45.520]  for him or the products. And it's hard not to compare it to Lennon and McCartney and
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:53.520]  when the Beatles broke up, Lennon and McCartney, I think we're still making some Beatles-esque
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:59.920]  music. I think Imagine from John Lennon, you could easily, no pun intended, Imagine as a Beatles
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:06.320]  song. I think the band on the run from Paul McCartney at Wings clearly to me sounds like
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:12.640]  a Beatles song, perhaps because Paul sort of put together the last album of the Beatles and it was
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:18.480]  sort of going in that direction. And then the longer it went before John Lennon's unfortunate
[02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:23.840]  assassination, the less Beatles-like their music sounded and I think there's some truth to that
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.280]  where like in the first five years after Steve Jobs died, Johnny Ive's work still seemed more
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:35.440]  infused with the collaborative spirit of Steve Jobs and then maybe in the second five years
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:44.800]  was more all Johnny and was less for it. You can't blame him for that, right? That 10 years after
[02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:49.760]  Steve Jobs was dead that the designs were more Johnny than Steve? Well, of course they were.
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:56.240]  He's been dead for 10 years, right? I mean, that's not a criticism. But I do think you speak
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.200]  for a lot of people and this is why I don't want to pick on you, but I think it's a perfect time
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:07.840]  for me to get this off my chest. I think much of what you blame on Johnny Ive was not
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.600]  Johnny Ive's fault. I think a lot of people think the butterfly keyboard is fucking Johnny Ive and
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:21.120]  I don't think that's the case. I think clearly he has a taste for thinness that possibly exceeds
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:27.840]  where the taste for thinness in devices, the optimal level and clearly the overriding
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:32.880]  idea behind the butterfly keyboards was to make the whole keyboard mechanism thinner
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:37.520]  so that the overall laptop could be thinner. We talked about the 12-inch MacBook Air or MacBook,
[02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:43.040]  no adjective, which was the first device to have the butterfly because perhaps it couldn't have
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:51.440]  been that thin without it. But I think that the sad sort of head-scratching saga of the butterfly
[02:27:51.440 --> 02:27:56.720]  keyboard isn't that they shipped it in the first place or that it had problems.
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:02.640]  If you never have any problems, you're not trying hard enough, right? Like if you're really pushing
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:07.600]  the edges of what you can do, whether it's keyboards or materials or colors or anything,
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:14.240]  and you never ever screw up, maybe you're not testing the limits of what you can do.
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:23.600]  The real head-scratcher with the keyboards was why the fuck did it take so long to fix it, right?
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.400]  And again, I say this with sympathy to anybody who bought one early on. Even if they had said,
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:33.200]  okay, this isn't going to work, let's get rid of it and come to the solution they eventually
[02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  did come to, which is we're going to get rid of these butterfly mechanisms and invent a new
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:45.440]  scissor mechanism that is thinner and will feel... The feel, I think, was always subjective.
[02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:49.440]  Some people love the feel of the butterfly keyboards. I think our mutual friend Casey
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:55.200]  Liss liked typing on the butterfly keyboards. That's subjective, and I could see that.
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:02.320]  The guy I talked to at Drexel years ago loved typing on his 12-inch MacBook, and he typed
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:06.080]  thousands of words of emails every day, he said, and it's the best keyboard he ever used,
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:09.760]  and his fingers never felt better at the end of the day. That's subjective.
[02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:16.880]  The reliability is objective and was absolutely ridiculous and horrible, right? As I wrote at
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:21.280]  times over the saga, I don't recall all the years I've ever been using computers. I don't
[02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:26.800]  remember ever typing the E key and not having an E appear on screen. Whereas people with
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.120]  these butterfly keyboards, they'd type an E, and sometimes they'd get no E, or sometimes
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:35.440]  they'd get four E's from one press on the E. And sometimes they'd...
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.920]  And if you wanted to repair it, it was going to be like $800.
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:43.120]  Right. Or sometimes you'd type a space, and then the space key never came back up. That's
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:48.240]  it. It just was down, and now it's down, and now you have to take it in, and it's $800
[02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:53.120]  fixed or whatever. Why did it take so long? I don't think that was Johnny Ive. And this
[02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:59.360]  is me being me and having sources. Maybe the problem wasn't that... The problem definitely
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:03.360]  was not Johnny Ive insisting, no, we're going to keep this keyboard because we want these
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:07.440]  things to be thinner, and I like the butterfly keyboard, and fuck you, we're going to keep
[02:30:07.440 --> 02:30:12.320]  it. That's definitely not what happened. What happened, to my understanding, is that the
[02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:18.160]  engineers in charge of the keyboard kept saying, okay, we can fix this. And they did. They
[02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:22.160]  announced that we've got... Now we have a membrane, and now we've got this. And they
[02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:28.560]  had like three stabs at the butterfly keyboard. But that the engineers behind it really believed
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:33.040]  it, that this time we've got it, this time we've got it, we've got it, we can fix it.
[02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:38.160]  And somewhere up the chain, somebody had to make a decision. Do we believe these guys
[02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:44.320]  and let them take another crack at it? Or do we say, screw this, we have to invent something
[02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:48.720]  all new? It took too long to get to the point where they said, screw this, we're going to
[02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:53.760]  do something all new. If there's a role Johnny Ive had in that, it's that because he was
[02:30:53.760 --> 02:30:58.960]  checked out, I don't think he was involved. I know for a fact he was not insisting we
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:04.400]  keep the butterfly keyboard. But if Steve Jobs were still around, would it have taken
[02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:08.720]  that long to say, screw this? Luckily, he probably would have fired the whole team.
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:14.640]  But we're going to do something all new. I'm sick of this, right? That's the part of Steve
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:18.000]  Jobs that Johnny Ive, I think, never really took in. Because I don't think Johnny Ive
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:24.480]  really loves using Macs the way Steve Jobs actually loved to use his Macs, right?
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:26.960]  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah. Frankly, I can't see Steve ever shipping
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:30.320]  the butterfly keyboard in the first place because it was so compromised in metrics.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:36.640]  Steve cared a lot about keyboards. One of his key innovations was when they started
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:41.200]  making the smaller laptops, like when they made the first 12-inch PowerBook, he insisted,
[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:47.040]  no, this is going to have a full-size keyboard. Because he was a Mac nerd and using a smaller
[02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:51.600]  than a full-size keyboard sucked. And he knew that. And the PC industry was making all those
[02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:56.240]  netbooks. And there was a lot of pressure on Apple. When are you going to make a netbook?
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:01.120]  You're going to lose to netbooks. And they were insistent, like, no, that's actually
[02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:04.640]  not a thing we want to do because it's not a good experience. And one of the biggest
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:08.800]  parts of why it wasn't a good experience was netbooks had these really cramped tiny
[02:32:08.800 --> 02:32:14.320]  little keyboards. And Steve, I think, would not have shipped a keyboard that had that
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:20.480]  many compromises. And certainly, if he did ship it in the 12-inch MacBook where it seemed
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:26.320]  more necessary, I don't think he would have also then moved it to all of the other laptops,
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.600]  which is what happened with what happened.
[02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:32.640]  I like I told you earlier, as part of my research doing my MacBook Air review last week,
[02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:38.080]  I looked up the 11-inch MacBook Air just to get the size and weight and do some comparisons.
[02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:42.960]  And I saw that I read reread the press release from the first one. And it wasn't a Steve
[02:32:42.960 --> 02:32:46.560]  Jobs quote, it was a Phil Schiller quote, you know, there's like a formula to Apple's
[02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:51.600]  PR, where it's like, first paragraph tells you, here's the new thing. Here's the highlights
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:58.240]  of it. And then the second paragraph is a quote from the most relevant Apple executive,
[02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:01.840]  right? Like if it's a new thing about iWork or something like that, it's going to be
[02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:07.280]  Susan Prescott. And if it's something with Apple Music or something like that, it might
[02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:12.000]  be Eddy Cue. And if it was a product, it was going to be Phil Schiller, if it wasn't
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:16.880]  going to be Steve Jobs. And it's a Phil Schiller quote about the MacBook 11-inch MacBook Air
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:20.000]  and why it's awesome. And like one of the first things in this quote is that it has
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:25.360]  a full-size keyboard. Like, we're only going to have this quote from Phil Schiller saying
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:29.440]  this, that and the other and one of this, that and the other about why it's so awesome
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:32.800]  was that it has a full-size keyboard. So I think you're exactly right. What else do
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:38.320]  you not like about late era Johnny Ive? I mean, it's hard to know how much of this
[02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:43.520]  was him versus other people who are possibly under him. But I think that the two things
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:52.000]  I can really point to are the over-minimalism of the hardware. So things like removing unnecessary
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:59.120]  ports or lesser-used ports. That was part of a whole industry-wide trend towards overly
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.840]  obsessing over minimalism everywhere. But it was certainly led by Apple and I think
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:09.680]  Johnny Ive where less became more for everyone. And everyone started deleting features and
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:14.720]  deleting capabilities. And conveniently, it's cheaper and easier to make stuff with less
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:18.480]  functionality. And I think that that corrupted a lot of people's thinking processes. But
[02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:25.200]  it was this obsession with give people less. And that played out in a lot of different
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:30.640]  ways. It stripped away a lot of the personality of the products. We lost a lot of niceties
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:36.400]  that actually serve functions. Like old MacBook Pros before this era used to be able to push
[02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:40.560]  a button somewhere on it to see the battery level as the lights that would light up. You
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:46.080]  had MagSafe and the light on the MagSafe plug that would tell you whether it was charging
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:50.160]  or charged. You had the light up Apple logo on the back. You had the sleep LED. You had
[02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:54.800]  all these little niceties that kind of made it a little more whimsical, a little more
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:35:01.040]  humane, and also usually provided important functionality. And the Johnny Ive era stripped
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:06.640]  a whole bunch out of weight. Now, that I think showed in many different ways, the hardware,
[02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:13.360]  etc. But also, it really became a problem and still is a problem in the software. When
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:19.040]  Johnny Ive inherited kind of the whole weight of all their design after Steve passed away,
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:26.800]  Tim put a lot on Johnny as a result of Steve being gone and including making Johnny in
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:33.440]  charge of all software design under his purview as well. And then, so he brings in Alan Dye's
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.960]  team and it's a radical departure. We get iOS 7 and then later on we get Big Sur on
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:43.600]  the Mac. And I think the pendulum has swung the other direction now on the hardware side,
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:50.000]  where now pro hardware, even consumer level, even the new MacBook Air, hardware is now
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.480]  getting its ports back. It's getting its functionality back. It's having a better balance
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:36:00.000]  of form over function or form versus function, rather. Whereas the Johnny Ive hardware peak,
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:04.640]  I think things were out of balance there. The software, though, hasn't been corrected yet
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:10.480]  because Johnny left the software organization that he set up for software design and UI
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.120]  design is still there and still very much in power. And that's the other side of his
[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:21.120]  leadership where I don't think Johnny Ive was qualified to lead software design or to
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:26.320]  even choose who should lead it. He was clearly not qualified for that. It was not his expertise.
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:31.040]  Tim shouldn't have put it on him. But anyway, he got that responsibility. He set up that
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:39.760]  team with Alan Dye and I think the software design still has not corrected its pendulum.
[02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:46.080]  It is still out of whack. It's still very much obsessed with hiding as much as possible. Again,
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:50.880]  over obsession with minimalism for its own sake, to the point where it actually harms
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:55.760]  functionality and usability of things. And we see that all over the place with it's worse,
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:01.600]  I think, on the Mac. Because on the Mac, we gave Alan Dye the tool of hover states. I wish
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.360]  we never gave this to him. Hover states don't exist on touch screens, which is part of the
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:10.560]  reason why it's harder to expose what functionality is like on on desktops and laptops, you can like
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:13.680]  hover the mouse pointer over something and you can have a tool tip pop up or something,
[02:37:13.680 --> 02:37:16.960]  you can explain functionality, you could have stuff slide in and out, you don't really have
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:21.360]  as much on touch screen. So it's harder to expose that stuff. But on the Mac, it's like
[02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:26.640]  this, there's the the concept of a hover state now on the Mac. And it seems like
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:32.640]  the design team, the software design team now uses that as a method by which to hide
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:38.960]  everything by default, and just take more and more stuff away from the screen. And the rationale
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:43.600]  that they used to give whenever whenever the interface would be able to minimize itself or
[02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:48.240]  hide in certain modes, the rationale is always, we're making space for your content,
[02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:53.600]  your content can shine, we don't want to interfere with your content. And they've gone so far now
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:59.760]  that the content is starting to auto hide, the stuff you actually need to see is getting swept
[02:37:59.760 --> 02:38:05.440]  away and buried in drawers and swept under the rug and hidden behind hover states. And it's it's so
[02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:14.080]  far in that direction now that things are getting harder and worse to use. And I hope that correction
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:19.200]  of the pendulum swinging back the way it has for the hardware. I hope that happens on software.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:22.640]  I don't know if Alan Dye personally is responsible for that. He's just the name that we know,
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:27.840]  because he's like at the top of the organization. I assume that if he is good enough to lead the
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:34.480]  organization of software design at Apple, I assume he is capable of editing his style and correcting
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:39.680]  it. And I hope that he does. And if he can't or won't do that, I hope they find another way to
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:47.440]  get it in there. Because that the software is, it's still way too far in that direction. And
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:53.920]  the current, you know, what we have now with iOS 16, and macOS, Aventura, it's not correcting any
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:59.680]  of those problems. In fact, iOS 16 hides even more stuff under hover states and things like stuff
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.840]  like, you know, how like, what's the how much time is left in this podcast, I'm listening to you look
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:07.360]  at control center, it's like, where, where is this countdown? Like, things just, everything just
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:11.440]  keeps getting hidden and buried and stuck under hover states on the Mac. And it's just, oh, my
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:17.680]  God, just please, like, I, I don't need everything about my computer to be swept away. The content
[02:39:17.680 --> 02:39:23.440]  and the stuff I'm working with, is why I'm using the computer. I want to see these things. I don't
[02:39:23.440 --> 02:39:29.520]  need things to be overly minimal. It like Johnny, I've designed computer hardware, as if it was
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:34.640]  somebody designing computers who hated computers. It seems like the current software design team
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:39.360]  designs computers for people who hate computers, like it seems like they, they don't understand
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:46.160]  why we're using these things. I that was a fantastic rant, number one, and thoughtful and
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:51.040]  as kind as you could be. Number one, for people who do not remember, you mentioned this, and it
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:55.600]  is one of the coolest things. I don't know how far back I think you have to go back to a powerbook.
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:01.760]  I'm almost certain. But I do think it was true in the it was definitely true in the aluminum era.
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:07.280]  But the power button that you could press on the side of a power button, there was a little subtle
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.240]  button. It was also aluminum, just a little round circle. Well, it started out it was on the battery
[02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:16.160]  when the battery was removable, it was on the battery on the bottom, right. And then when they
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:19.200]  switched to unibody, and the batteries were all built in, they moved the button over the side.
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:24.480]  But if for those of you who aren't old enough, who are long enough Mac users to remember this,
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:30.240]  it was awesome. Just a little subtle button, almost invisible. But when you press the button,
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:39.680]  then there were like four green LEDs. And amazingly, when when a you didn't see the LEDs,
[02:40:39.680 --> 02:40:43.040]  when you weren't using it, they were like, somehow painted over.
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:47.920]  Like the aluminum, it had like these micro, right? Yeah, that's in it. So yeah,
[02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:51.840]  you could see it when they were on, you'd see the light shining through. But when they were off,
[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:56.320]  it looked like nothing was there. Nothing was there. So just a little button. But that meant
[02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:03.360]  like, if you're Mac, but you hadn't, you hadn't opened your power book in a while, days,
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:07.680]  something maybe you don't remember your but your you just take it out. It's in your in your,
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:12.080]  your backpack. You could just Yeah, that's what that's what it was. When it's in a bag,
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:16.480]  you could just press the button. Yeah. And say, Oh, I've it's all four LEDs light up,
[02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:21.120]  I don't even need to charge like, let's say you're at the airport. And you've got 40 minutes to go
[02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:26.560]  for your flight. And you're like, Hey, should I just charge my my, my laptop while I have a
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:32.240]  last chance. And you could check the charge, hit the button without opening it. And at the time,
[02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  opening it and waking it took longer than it does today. Right? It was sort of a
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:43.600]  time type of password. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, now to take my password, type the password,
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.080]  hit return. Wait, wait, wait, there it is. All right, batteries at 82%. I'm fine.
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.160]  You just hit the button, saw the lights. And you knew Oh, shit, I better charge it only got one
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:59.760]  light or Oh, all four lit up. And when they weren't on, they just disappeared. It was amazing.
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.840]  But that's Johnny Ive, right? It's john, that sort of shit of these little invisible micro
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:12.880]  holes in the aluminum. Johnny Ives team and he loved stuff like that. Where did that go?
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:18.560]  I don't know. I honestly see it. Like I said, like I have some info from people I've talked
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:23.200]  to over the years about the keyboard. And I really don't think it's it's right to blame that on him.
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:29.920]  Is the fact that stuff like that went away? Because Johnny Ive pushed it away? Or is it
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:37.120]  because he didn't care? Right? Either way, he was the chief design officer. He's Johnny fucking
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:43.120]  Ive. So it is the buck stops there, right? It's, it's his responsibility either way. But I
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:50.400]  genuinely don't know if it was him and his taste, driving it away, that I don't even want that
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:56.000]  little fucking button. I want nothing. Or was it that they got? It's like, ah, but that would be
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.320]  a lot of work now because there's and he's like, All right, whatever. I don't know. I don't know
[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:06.640]  which way it is. But either way, it is his responsibility. It the thing about magsafe,
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:12.160]  you can't say it enough. magsafe going away and coming back half of it, the obvious thing is that
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:18.080]  magsafe is kind of awesome. And it's easy to connect Stephen Aquino, everybody's favorite
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:23.120]  writer about accessibility issues, as mentioned over and over and over again, what a wonderful
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:29.440]  accessibility thing it is, because you don't have to it, whether you prefer lightning or USB C, or
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:36.800]  whatever else, when you have to put a male plug into a female port, you got to line it up. And
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:43.120]  it's even if you have no motor problems or vision problems, lining it up, it's, it's kind of hard
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:48.240]  magsafe literally connects itself, it jumps out of your fingers. Yeah, and goes in. And it's one
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:53.680]  it's like, one of the best examples I can ever think of the way that accessibility benefits
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.800]  everybody, including the people who don't have like a motor difficulty or a vision difficulty,
[02:43:58.800 --> 02:44:05.600]  to line up the the USB C thing. But so and of course, the whole thing that you could kick the
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:09.280]  cord or whatever, and it just pops out rather than taking your Mac with it. Okay, that's great.
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:14.080]  magsafe is good. But the other thing is you get another port, right? So you charge with magsafe.
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:19.040]  And now you've got two free USB C ports, it doubles the odds that you don't need a dongle.
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:26.640]  That's great. Whether Johnny Ive actually pushed that away, or whether he was just like, all
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:32.800]  right, whatever, and just let it happen. Either way, it's his responsibility. And they were worse
[02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:39.120]  for it. magsafe is better. So glad it came back the software thing. That's, that's where I am in
[02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:44.880]  complete agreement with you, except for the fact that it was not Tim Cook pushing it on Johnny
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:51.440]  Ive. Johnny Ive took it that and I can report that as a fact. Did Johnny Ive fire Scott Forstall?
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:55.600]  I don't know that I can say that I can't don't don't don't listen to this podcast and say John
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:45:01.760]  Gruber says on episode 352, or whatever the hell number we're up to that Johnny Ive had Scott
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:07.920]  Forstall fired, but it's what whatever it is like, they clearly did not get along together. They did
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:14.160]  not get along. Yeah, I know for a fact that Johnny Ive thought and perhaps still thinks that he could
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:19.360]  do a better job designing software than Scott Forstall and Greg Christie, who used to head up
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:24.480]  the who did not get forced out or fired, but just retired, but and there's all sorts of other names
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.200]  like that don't come to mind. But Greg Christie would be the one that comes to mind. Greg Christie
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:37.440]  probably isn't familiar as a name to a lot of people, but was absolutely just brilliant human
[02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:46.000]  interface designer of that Steve Jobs era of design. Ken Kishenda, who now at Humane, but
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:51.360]  most well known who wrote the book creative selections was on this show a couple months
[02:45:51.360 --> 02:45:56.800]  ago was a great guest, but most well known as the guy who was the directly responsible
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:02.880]  individual and engineer for the iPhone keyboard. And in his book tells a great story, where he was
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:09.040]  working on the iPhone touchscreen keyboard and was coming to where it ended up but at the time,
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.760]  still had like, let's say like the A, S and D. If it was all the idea was, well, your thumb is so
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:23.840]  fat so you could push anywhere in the area of A, S and D and let this autocorrect figure out which
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:30.160]  one you meant, but it was just one big key on screen a button that said ASD and he was talked
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:35.440]  himself into knots over what do I do. And Greg Christie just said to him one day, just make them
[02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:39.920]  all their own fucking buttons like on a regular keyboard. And Greg Christie is not a Californian.
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:46.240]  He was from New York and I've met him. And he definitely does not talk like someone who got
[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:53.360]  California eyes talks like he never left the Bronx. Just make them all their own fucking
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:59.280]  buttons. It doesn't matter if the actual area you're looking, reading the touches from is that
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:05.760]  big, just draw them on the screen as buttons. And Ken was like, Oh, yeah, that's right. Greg
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:13.680]  Christie had that influence a thousand different ways on all of Apple systems. But liked that sort
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:22.240]  of, hey, if this is a text field, in a dialog box, it should be distinct from the non editable text
[02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:28.640]  area around it. And it should be very clear what is editable and what is not. And it should be
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:33.760]  not. And if it's a button, it should really look like a button, like a really beautiful button.
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:38.000]  Let's say you think buttons are boring. Well, let's prove them wrong by making the button
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:43.280]  look really cool. Whereas the modern way is buttons are boring. So let's just get rid of
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:47.440]  making things look like buttons, even though they act like buttons. My least favorite thing
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:56.080]  or the exemplification of the Alan Dye era of graphic design style UI design in all of systems
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:01.680]  is the search field in the toolbar, like just mail, right? I search my mail all the time.
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:07.280]  There's the idea in an interface of whether a control is enabled or disabled. So like a button
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:13.200]  that is enabled looks like you can push it. And if it's disabled, because maybe whatever the
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:19.280]  context of the software you're in, you can't push the submit button until you enter both your name
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:23.760]  and your email, right? So you have to enter your name and your email. And then there's a button
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:31.760]  that says submit. And if the email field is blank, or it doesn't look like a legit email address,
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:38.000]  the submit button looks disabled. And then you type an actual email address and the button
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.560]  lights up because it's enabled and then you can tap it or click it, whatever, right? Everybody
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:50.160]  understands this. The text field is the same way. Is it enabled? Can I click on it and start typing
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:57.440]  or is it disabled? And at this point you can't search. Well, the search field in all the toolbars
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:04.640]  in macOS starting two years ago, whenever they redesigned it, they look disabled all the time.
[02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:09.200]  They're just completely flat. The background is exactly the same as the background of the
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:15.200]  toolbar itself. It's just a rectangle with a very faint thing that says search. And whether it's
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.640]  clickable so you can type or not, well, click it and find out. Why? Why would you do that?
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:28.640]  I don't understand. I know for a fact Johnny Ive did not like the direction of Apple's
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:32.720]  software interfaces, thought he could do a better job. Is that why Scott Forstall was
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.320]  shown the door? I don't think that was the only reason there were personality clashes.
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:44.560]  But why people like Greg Christie, the old HI team was let go and dissolved. It was outside
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:50.640]  Johnny Ive's team. And the new HI team, which is still there under Alan Dye, who was hired
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:55.920]  by Johnny Ive, is inside Johnny Ive's old team. And I'm with you. I don't like the direction
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:01.760]  they've gone. I could go on and on and on. I probably should go on and on and on more than I do.
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:03.840]  Yeah, please. They actually listen to you on this stuff.
[02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:09.600]  Getting rid of scroll bars on the Mac, I don't get it. I always got, right from the get-go,
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:15.040]  I was like, oh, this is really clever. On this tiny little screen that's only three and a half inches,
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.640]  they just don't show the scroll bar. And then while you're scrolling and it's all updated
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:25.280]  live, then the scroll bar appears temporarily to show you where you are. And then it fades away
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:31.440]  because they just don't have room. Why would they adopt that on the Mac? Because it's like you said,
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.160]  they think it's clutter, but it's useful information. How long is this document? Is
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:41.680]  this document 10 pages long and I'm looking at one-tenth of it because that's what's on screen?
[02:50:41.680 --> 02:50:48.800]  Or is it 1.1 pages long and 90% of it fits on screen? Well, when you have scroll bars showing,
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:53.280]  you see how long it is and where you are all the time. And there's plenty of room for it.
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:54.160]  Solved problems.
[02:50:54.160 --> 02:51:00.480]  Right. Hover states. I agree with you that the proxy icons, which I have written about
[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:06.960]  a daring fireball disappearing from the interface. I don't know the backstory on that of how that
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:11.920]  disappeared, but when they first made them disappear, they would appear on hover. But
[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:16.720]  it was even worse than that because you had to wait like a second. It wasn't even like
[02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:22.240]  that was the worst. So the proxy icon is like when you're in the finder and you open a folder
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:26.400]  and you're in a window, the folder up in the title bar with the name of the current folder,
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:31.840]  and it has a little folder icon, you can click on it and drag it. And it's a proxy for the folder.
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:38.640]  Then you could drag it somewhere else and copy it or whatever you wanted to do. You could do things
[02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:44.240]  with it because it was there. They got rid of the proxy icons and then it didn't even appear
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:49.440]  instantly when you hovered. You had to like, wait a second. My imagined, again, this is my
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:57.920]  imagination, no little birdies, but it seems plausible, was that the Alan Dye team was like,
[02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:02.720]  what are these icons doing up here? It looks ugly. And then other people were like, whoa,
[02:52:02.720 --> 02:52:06.240]  they're useful. Here's what you can do with them. You can do this, you can do that, you can do this.
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:11.120]  There's all sorts of useful things. We've had them since like 1995 or something like that,
[02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.520]  sometime back in the classic era in the 90s. People are used to them and we've had all these
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:22.000]  features. And then the Alan Dye team was like, well, we never do that. That sounds like nerd
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:28.000]  shit to get rid of it. And then my imagined backstory is that the people who liked them
[02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:32.560]  and knew they were useful were like, well, maybe if we put them on hover state, they won't notice
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:36.720]  and they'll let us keep them. And then they were like, what is this shit? I moved my mouse up there
[02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:40.160]  and the folder icon appeared. I thought we got rid of those. And they're like, I put in a half
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:45.760]  second delay. And then the Alan Dye team never noticed and it stayed. And then there's a secret
[02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:50.720]  default thing you can type in terminal to make it appear instantly. And I don't know.
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:55.280]  Yeah. And eventually they added an accessibility pref that always displays them. And so accessibility
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:01.760]  preferences are often where good designs become possible because it's like, this is where,
[02:53:01.760 --> 02:53:07.600]  this is where the teams that want this design to be fixed can convince someone to let them
[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:12.800]  put a checkbox for it. So that's if we're writing the, the, this is the end of the Johnny Ivera.
[02:53:12.800 --> 02:53:19.520]  I'm much more effusive about his, the entire run of his hardware. And yes, there was some hiccups,
[02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:25.040]  the butterfly keyboards and the disappearing ports. But I also think it's not that those
[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:31.040]  things came back in the last three years because he's gone. He, he's, he was definitely involved
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:36.000]  while he was working at Love From. And I heard from somebody who knew somebody source of a source
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.920]  who just like months ago had to have a serious design thing with Johnny Ive about something.
[02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:46.080]  I don't know what it is they were working on because my little birdies always never tell me
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:51.040]  the actual things are working on, but he's been, he was involved as of just a few months ago.
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:56.080]  It's also the case that everybody who's still at the Apple design team are all Johnny Ive's
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:02.880]  disciples, right? So I don't know. I, I, I, I almost feel like he's doing a solid for his team
[02:54:03.440 --> 02:54:10.800]  by allowing people like us to conjecture that, Hey, everything's gotten better since he left,
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:14.640]  even though nothing's actually changed. Like if he had stayed another five years,
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:16.800]  I think everything would be pretty much what we have today.
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.320]  But my, I don't know. I don't know either. I don't know that because, you know,
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:26.800]  politically it's even though these are people who were all working under him for the most part,
[02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:34.640]  it's still not him being there. He had so much clout in the company, so much power that just
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:40.080]  him not being there, I think allows other people and their ideas to shine through a little bit
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:44.240]  more than they otherwise would have. And, and even suppose, I mean, I don't know how any of
[02:54:44.240 --> 02:54:49.920]  this stuff works cause people don't talk. Suppose that some of the laptop ports and things like
[02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:56.000]  that, maybe some of those decisions were being pushed by say product marketing and industrial
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.320]  design said, no, you know, that's the kind of thing. Like if Johnny is there heading up industrial
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:07.280]  design, that kind of decision has a lot more sway and can probably is probably harder to override
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:12.160]  or argue with. And then when Johnny's gone, then maybe there's a better balance between
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:18.160]  the different needs. And so the new head of the design team is Evans Hankey and she has a
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:24.480]  remarkably low profile. There's actually, did you see the GQ, not GQ America, but GQ UK had
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:28.400]  an interview with her about the new MacBook Air, which is kind of really kind of interesting. And
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:33.600]  she, she talks about the fact that it's no longer has tapered edges cause it doesn't need them.
[02:55:33.600 --> 02:55:39.200]  There was a wallpaper had a thing with the design team last year, which was really,
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:43.360]  really interesting. Not for what they said, which was mostly the same sort of,
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:47.920]  eh, just sort of prepared canned statements, but it was really interesting cause they showed
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:52.000]  where they work and you could see, I thought it was really interesting.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:56.960]  That was their actual iPhones. There was like an overhead shot of the design team at a big table
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:02.000]  and you could see which people on the design team use iPhone cases and which ones don't and how
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:07.920]  many, and a bunch of them actually use the wallet. And that was not for show and it was not, well,
[02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:13.360]  we better put up onto these MagSafe wallets on here cause we're selling them. I verified with
[02:56:13.360 --> 02:56:18.480]  somebody who would definitely know that, no, those are just their, that was their phones. And that's
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:23.680]  the ones who had wallets were the people who use the MagSafe wallet. They showed a bunch of stuff
[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:31.040]  on the wall from SF symbols, which is sort of like a font, but it's like a collection of how many
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:36.800]  SF symbols are there now? About 3,800. Yeah. So I was going to say thousands. Yeah. 3,800
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:41.920]  little icons for all sorts of things. It's one of the neatest things Apple has done in recent years
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:47.600]  cause they're available to all developers. So if you need like a weird icon, like a finger pointing
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.160]  type thing or whatever, they had all these things on the wall and they showed us that the return of
[02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:57.440]  the dog cow, which is coming back a little bit of whimsy coming back to macOS in the, and apparently
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:57:01.920]  in the iOS too, where the print dialogue is going to have Claris the dog cow to show you whether
[02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:09.520]  you're printing in landscape or portrait, which is awesome and warms my heart and is fun and is
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:17.200]  both pleasing to someone who knows where it comes from in the history, but also as good as any way
[02:57:17.200 --> 02:57:21.760]  of indicating whether the print is going to be portrait or landscape. So why not? It was hanging
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:27.040]  on the wall in their design studio before it ever came out in software. When has Apple ever shown
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:33.920]  stuff like that? Fun! By all accounts, Evans Hanke is a very keen manager, but she's not a designer
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:40.720]  herself. Really? Not like Johnny Ive. So she's a very high profile person at Apple who we know
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:45.840]  almost nothing about because she has never appeared on stage. Doesn't do the videos like
[02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:51.440]  Johnny did. I would love to meet her if anybody's listening could make that happen. So it's hard to
[02:57:51.440 --> 02:57:56.400]  know what her direct influence is, but I don't think, I don't think the Apple's hardware would
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:01.360]  be different at all or very different if Johnny Ive had stayed on as chief design officer. But the
[02:58:01.360 --> 02:58:07.760]  weird thing to me, not weird, I guess it's not surprising, but the big change isn't Johnny Ive
[02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.560]  himself. It's the fact that when Johnny was there, he was the chief motherfucker in charge, right?
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:18.640]  He actually got a C-level title chief design officer. And when he left, there was no replacement
[02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:22.880]  for the chief design officer. Let's say Jeff Williams decides I'm going to spend the rest of
[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:28.320]  my life on the beach. I've had my good run. I've got lots of money. I'm done. And he left. They're
[02:58:28.320 --> 02:58:34.480]  going to name a new COO, right? There's going to be another. Jaws leaves, decides to go and,
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:39.360]  again, go to the beach or whatever you do when you retire. Somebody else is going to become
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:44.800]  the senior vice president for product marketing. Johnny Ive left and there was no replacement as
[02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:51.200]  chief design officer. Is that good or bad? I don't know, right? Like you're saying maybe it's best to
[02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:59.920]  let the product marketing and Jaws be in charge of the actual product design and the design team
[02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:06.000]  answers to product marketing and the software wise answers to Federighi and Federighi's in
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:12.640]  charge of software and the design team answers to Craig Federighi on software. But there's no longer
[02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:19.920]  and up until Johnny Ive was chief design officer, there was always a chief motherfucker in charge of
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:27.760]  Apple design. It was Steve Jobs and then it was Johnny by himself. And now nobody. What's the
[02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:34.160]  long-term effect of not having a singular person's taste running the whole thing?
[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:42.240]  I mean, in large ways, I think it's probably better to have some degree of committee.
[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:47.840]  Obviously design by committee is like this well-known fallacy for a reason. You don't
[02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:55.280]  want it to be too outrageous, but to have it be a little bit more collaborative instead of just
[02:59:55.280 --> 03:00:01.120]  one person being able to dictate everything the way they want, I think is a benefit. And I don't
[03:00:01.120 --> 03:00:04.960]  know if that's exactly how he worked, but he definitely had that power if he wanted to. And
[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:10.960]  you can look at the designs now and you can see hardware wise, it seems like they have a really
[03:00:10.960 --> 03:00:16.400]  coherent vision coming out, however it's happening. And whether it's Evans Hanke just being really
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:21.280]  good at managing the design or doing some of the design herself, I don't know what her background
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:26.080]  is. Managing egos? Yeah, that's probably a lot of it. When you're working with a bunch of really
[03:00:26.080 --> 03:00:30.000]  talented people, that's probably a huge part of the job. But whatever it is, she's doing a great
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:37.840]  job of getting out there a coherent vision with the hardware that is both attractive and functional
[03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:42.800]  and seems to be very well designed in almost every way that I can think of. I mean, really,
[03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:47.520]  it's like I couldn't have done a better job with, again, colors aside, that's like my main
[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:53.600]  complaint. Otherwise, this is a pretty great series of hardware that they put out recently.
[03:00:54.320 --> 03:01:00.560]  And so the hardware design seems totally fine. The software is a mess and it's continued. I mean,
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:07.440]  geez, have you used the settings app yet in Ventura? How long, how much time do we have left,
[03:01:07.440 --> 03:01:13.680]  Marco? Oh, my God. It's like I hadn't used it until yesterday when I put the beta on this new
[03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:19.840]  MacBook Air. It's so much worse than I thought. Like it still looks like the CSS hasn't loaded.
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:25.360]  Like I can't I can't believe this is what they're shipping. Even if they're going to make small
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:32.240]  tweaks, you can now release like we are so far beyond what small tweaks can fix. This is I,
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:37.520]  frankly, I can't believe it. It feels like such a downgrade every like every every year.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:41.920]  The same thing happens to me and I'm sure it'll happen again next year and the year after is WWDC
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:47.040]  comes out in early June and they show us stuff and some of the stuff is incomplete. And I think,
[03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:51.600]  well, they have a lot of time until it's supposed to ship. Right. And every year I think that and
[03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:57.200]  then every year the summer goes on and it doesn't change nearly as much as. And then all of a
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:03.120]  sudden we get to like this point. Right. Even just mid July, just like six, five, six weeks after WWDC.
[03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:07.920]  And then I start to remember all the times I've worked on software projects and I'm like,
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:12.400]  oh, yeah, everything takes way longer than you thought it would even fixes. And it's like,
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:16.880]  holy shit, it's going to be September soon. This this stuff is going to be locked down into a GM
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:23.520]  for iOS soon. And I don't know how long they think they can stretch it with Mac to come out in the
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:29.040]  fall. Maybe October at the latest. I mean, it's not going to be that like and major design changes
[03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:33.920]  don't happen at the last minute. Hey, I'm up to I'm the up to I wish them nothing but the best.
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:39.840]  I'd love for settings to improve remarkably between today when you and I are talking and
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:48.480]  whenever Mac OS Ventura ships in October, early November at the latest. But man, that is coming
[03:02:48.480 --> 03:02:54.640]  really fast. And boy, I don't see it. So yeah, no, I mean, they haven't fixed notifications on
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:03:00.480]  the Mac yet since Big Sur. Have you have they even touched them? Like it's this clearly very flawed,
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:06.480]  difficult design. And yet it hasn't changed in almost now three major OS versions like
[03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:15.680]  they clearly the software design team is not super responsive to complaints and problems
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:20.480]  with their design. Everybody has blind spots, right? But it seems and I think they're they're
[03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:26.400]  super not respond. And it seems like everybody who could really, really make the needle scratch
[03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:31.200]  and say, Stop, stop, stop, we've got to fix this. They've all got the same blind spots,
[03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:35.440]  and they've had them for years. And I don't know, I don't know how we get out of it.
[03:03:36.320 --> 03:03:43.040]  No, I mean, the settings app on Ventura looks like a prototype that you would show in like
[03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:46.960]  a design meeting and say, Hey, what if we go this direction? Yeah. And somebody else would say,
[03:03:47.520 --> 03:03:52.080]  Oh, yeah, let's try that. Let's start that now. Let's see it in a year. Right. And then they
[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.040]  would go back to shipping the old version of settings because it's better for now. And this
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:04:00.960]  isn't done at all yet. Like that. That's it looks like a prototype. And it doesn't look
[03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:07.200]  it's like, no, it doesn't look better in any way. It's what you could say one thing about it about
[03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:10.800]  some of Apple software design, you can say like, well, it looks nicer, even if it works,
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:14.560]  even if it works worse, right? This doesn't even look nicer than what you're placing. Like this
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:20.000]  looks worse and works work. Like I it looks again, it looks like the CSS failed to load. It looks
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:26.320]  like an electron app. It looks like everything. It's like the the opposite of good Mac design.
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:31.280]  And I'm not trying to stay in the past year. I know stuff moves on trends move on design moves
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:37.680]  on. I'm not saying everything should look like Aqua in 2003. But this is this is just not good
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:42.880]  design in any way. It's not good visual design or usability design. It's and it's just weird. It's
[03:04:42.880 --> 03:04:49.280]  just weird to have like the labels so far away from thing that you press to activate the label.
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:54.800]  It's just it's just it's not good. And there's so many hover states on everything and the controls
[03:04:54.800 --> 03:05:00.560]  look wrong and it just and it's the settings app. Why not just load it up? You know, everything's
[03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:07.520]  so low contrast. It's just seas of light gray divided by other light gray separated by slightly
[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:13.520]  lighter gray. It's like, Oh, my God, you have these amazing screens with amazing contrast.
[03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:18.800]  Use some of it like come on. What was the one there's one where it's like when you type the
[03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:23.280]  name of the it's like when you want to give your Mac a name. And it's like, where the hell do you
[03:05:23.280 --> 03:05:26.880]  do it? And there's like an Edit button, but the Edit button doesn't let you edit the name. And
[03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:31.200]  then it's like you just click where the name is. And even though it doesn't look like editable
[03:05:31.200 --> 03:05:36.080]  text, it is like it literally doesn't doesn't even look like a text field. It's like they've gone all
[03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:41.520]  the way to now you just click on it and start typing and and it works. And it's like, I don't
[03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:45.520]  even know where that is. I don't know. It's there's a couple of things like that. Anyway,
[03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:51.600]  I think we're out of time. We can't. We can't. Yeah, us finally. We cannot. We shouldn't have
[03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:56.560]  even brought up the settings app, except that we kind of had to. Let me thank the sponsors we had.
[03:05:56.560 --> 03:06:02.320]  We had fantastic sponsors for this episode. I'll go in reverse order. I think Squarespace brand new
[03:06:02.320 --> 03:06:08.000]  sponsor, I think Linode, where you can host your website or your servers or databases.
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:13.840]  Hover, where you can register domain names. Trade Coffee, where you can order coffee, get shipped
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:19.680]  to home, fresh coffee and ShipStation. Oh, man, that that's another new one. My thanks to them.
[03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:26.560]  Marco, it's always a pleasure to talk to you. And I appreciate the bonus length time you've devoted
[03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:31.760]  to this episode, but this was good. Yeah, thanks. This is a lot of fun. Three three and a half hours
[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:37.760]  of fun. I hope you met it. You sound a little sarcastic there. No, I actually I really enjoyed
[03:06:37.760 --> 03:06:44.720]  this. I have a real problem in my marriage where I did years. No, but I say things and I'm almost
[03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:50.240]  never, ever, ever sarcastic to my wife because I'm afraid of her. But I often say things and
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:53.680]  as soon as they're out of my mouth, I'm like, oh, that sounded like I didn't mean it. Like,
[03:06:53.680 --> 03:06:58.000]  hey, would you mind going to get ice? We're having people over like, yeah, sure, I'll get ice.
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:03.200]  And it's like, oh, that sounded like I meant like she's putting me on it. So I don't know,
[03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:06.240]  I'm getting sensitive to it because I you know, I don't know if you know this. I do have a
[03:07:06.240 --> 03:07:11.920]  sarcastic streak. I just don't let it come out. Also, no, I love doing this for the
[03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:17.280]  eternity. It's actually like this is the longest podcast I record every year. And it's fun. Let me
[03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:23.120]  tell you this. Speaking of my lovely wife, Amy, I about an hour ago, I was out of hop water here
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:28.480]  and my throat. I'd still I need more. I've actually consumed more water than I usually do during a
[03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:34.960]  podcast. I texted her to bring me if she could or just send them, send the boy down, send me, send,
[03:07:34.960 --> 03:07:40.240]  send somebody down here with another hop water. And she texted me back. And before she did,
[03:07:40.240 --> 03:07:44.480]  and she's right before she did, it took her a while. She said, sorry, she wasn't
[03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:48.720]  wearing her watch. And then this is what she texted me. She's not listening. We don't have
[03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:54.400]  a live thing. She hasn't been listening in. This is her exact text. So sorry, not wearing my watch.
[03:07:55.120 --> 03:07:58.560]  Tell Marco that hops water tastes like an airplane toilet.
[03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:03.680]  Oh, we've got we've got we know now from now that I think from the trade table.
[03:08:03.680 --> 03:08:07.680]  Now that I think about it, that's what she said all along. I actually misquoted her. This is why
[03:08:07.680 --> 03:08:12.000]  I need to do the correction right here on the show. She actually said after taking a sip that
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:17.600]  it was she is how she imagined I hope God I hope because I've kissed that mouse that she it's how
[03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:23.840]  she imagined an airplane toilet taste, not an airplane tray. So your mileage may vary with the
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:31.760]  hop water. I love it. I feel like if you like IPAs, like if you like strong hops flavor in beer,
[03:08:32.400 --> 03:08:39.120]  then you have a chance of liking this. If you if you are not an IPA person, yeah, probably skip
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:45.680]  this. Lick a lick a toilet instead. Or just have some house black cherry. It's much better.
[03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:48.480]  All right. Thank you, Marco. Thank you.
