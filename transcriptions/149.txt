[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  The dulcet tones of your sweet voice, Glenn.
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.640]  I have a poem, I wrote a poem, by the way.
[00:04.640 --> 00:06.240]  Oh, well, well, let's hear it.
[00:06.240 --> 00:08.800]  I'm trying to guess what it's about.
[00:08.800 --> 00:11.160]  I was, I was moved by the ending of the Apple filing.
[00:11.160 --> 00:13.920]  So, and I've been listening to Hamilton way too much.
[00:13.920 --> 00:15.560]  Are you a fan of Hamilton and you've been listening to it?
[00:15.560 --> 00:16.480]  I have not.
[00:16.480 --> 00:20.400]  I am aware that it exists and I'm aware that it's a sensation.
[00:20.400 --> 00:25.120]  And I agree that the premise sounds, uh, it sounds fascinating,
[00:25.120 --> 00:27.800]  but I've actually not like watched or listened to any of it yet.
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.360]  It's kind of a brain virus.
[00:29.360 --> 00:30.360]  Like I'd heard about it.
[00:30.360 --> 00:32.000]  I sort of was like, well, maybe I'll wait.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.240]  I'll see it some, I don't want to.
[00:33.240 --> 00:36.600]  And then I was like, well, listen to a song and then you just spiral down.
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.080]  So this is, this is my poem inspired by the end of the Apple brief with
[00:41.120 --> 00:43.400]  apologies to Hamilton, uh, your honor.
[00:43.400 --> 00:46.560]  We must aver in reading Brandeis, government zeal's a danger, not
[00:46.560 --> 00:48.560]  understanding the scope of their pleading.
[00:48.800 --> 00:52.120]  The danger to liberty lies within mistreating American's rights.
[00:52.120 --> 00:57.360]  We posit their exceedingly well-meaning, but insidious encroaching, demeaning.
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.200]  There we go.
[00:58.400 --> 01:00.960]  Very well said, uh, Nipsey Russell for the ages.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.600]  Um, I've also been reading, uh, Aaron Burr papers because you know how the
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.160]  government cited, uh, I've been actually going back and reading some of the
[01:12.160 --> 01:15.160]  historical documents, clean some books from the 18 hundreds and some later
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.680]  books written about it, found an interesting article from 1982 have
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.280]  been looking at the original ciphers that, uh, the codes and ciphers they used.
[01:23.280 --> 01:26.320]  It's a very fascinating thing to see what the state of cryptography
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.320]  was in the late 17 hundreds, early 18 hundreds, all comes back to Hamilton.
[01:31.320 --> 01:32.280]  It kind of does.
[01:32.280 --> 01:34.080]  It's really kind of funny.
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.960]  Um, who, this is a tweet from my pal Buzz Anderson last night, who would
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.560]  have thought Aaron Burr would get so much attention into 2016.
[01:46.560 --> 01:47.720]  He's a little weird.
[01:47.720 --> 01:50.320]  And then they did a Hamilton performance at the white house.
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.320]  Like not long after the FBI was citing the Aaron Burr, Aaron Burr
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.160]  ostensibly wanted to become the emperor of Mexico, he had a plan.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.400]  American history is kind of awesome and strange.
[02:01.400 --> 02:06.360]  Let me tell you the emperor from Mexico, Mexico, he was going down
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.480]  the Mississippi to try to, uh, schedule some kind of event in a general who
[02:11.480 --> 02:12.720]  didn't want to get caught up with it.
[02:12.720 --> 02:15.880]  It had been corresponding with him for years, uh, turned over the, uh,
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.040]  ciphered letter and, uh, there's a trial and he was found innocent of
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.680]  treason because, uh, uh, the justice in the case, I'm blanking his name,
[02:25.680 --> 02:27.480]  famous justice Marshall Marshall.
[02:27.480 --> 02:27.800]  Thank you.
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.440]  Said, uh, that no actual like event had occurred.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.320]  So it wasn't treasonous to discuss this, even if that's what was discussed.
[02:35.320 --> 02:38.080]  So how would it have been treason to become the emperor of Mexico?
[02:38.080 --> 02:40.960]  Since it's not, it wasn't trying to become the emperor of the United States.
[02:41.200 --> 02:45.240]  He was trying to raise, uh, armed forces to fight against a separate, another
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.120]  nation that without the support and authority of America.
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.960]  So there was some like, uh, I I'm losing the detail there, but it was under,
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.720]  it was treason because he was acting against the interest and stated policy
[02:58.720 --> 03:02.280]  of America and waging war, or that was the intent, but without actually doing it.
[03:02.280 --> 03:06.720]  So, uh, yeah, Burr wound up living for decades after that and, uh, never quite
[03:06.720 --> 03:10.240]  got back to the same position he had when he was vice president between the duel
[03:10.240 --> 03:15.280]  and then, uh, treason trial and then, um, just kind of people not really wanted to.
[03:15.760 --> 03:18.120]  What is the, what's the story of the duel?
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.160]  That's just one of those things that it's like you file it under your head that,
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.160]  that the revolutionary times were crazy and that they were, you know, like the
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.120]  remnants of the medieval era was still, you know, floating around.
[03:29.280 --> 03:30.200]  Well, it's complicated.
[03:30.200 --> 03:32.720]  Most things dueling was, was mostly banned.
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.520]  It was, and it was, you know, it was, I believe it had gone under practice in
[03:35.520 --> 03:38.160]  England, I think it was practiced in the barbarous colonies, right.
[03:38.160 --> 03:41.680]  And, uh, I am reading the Chernow biography of Hamilton now.
[03:41.680 --> 03:43.320]  So I haven't gotten to the intricacies there.
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.520]  I recall from my past reading and reading some things after, uh, the play, uh,
[03:47.560 --> 03:51.360]  sort of become popular, I went back and reread and they had to go to New Jersey
[03:51.360 --> 03:52.920]  and there's a line in the, in the musical.
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.680]  Yeah, you can do anything in New Jersey, right?
[03:54.680 --> 03:56.840]  You can just, everything's legal in New Jersey.
[03:56.880 --> 03:57.360]  It's a joke.
[03:57.360 --> 03:59.880]  And, uh, they had to go to New Jersey because it was still ostensibly legal,
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.760]  but, you know, manslaughter was, and, and murder still illegal.
[04:02.760 --> 04:07.960]  So you could, consensibly in some states, uh, you could duel and if no one was
[04:08.040 --> 04:10.800]  injured or killed, you might just walk away from it.
[04:10.800 --> 04:11.480]  But, um,
[04:11.880 --> 04:14.280]  Not much of a duel though, if nobody's injured.
[04:14.920 --> 04:16.640]  Well, it's to satisfy honor.
[04:16.640 --> 04:17.640]  I mean, that's the thing.
[04:17.640 --> 04:20.640]  Um, it's, it's funny, the ritualized violence.
[04:20.640 --> 04:24.600]  There's a really great essay in, uh, New York Times from a few days ago, these
[04:24.600 --> 04:29.000]  philosophers talking about what violence is, and they argue that violence isn't
[04:29.040 --> 04:31.560]  an act in itself, it's a, violence has a cycle.
[04:31.560 --> 04:32.560]  You know, there's an attack.
[04:32.560 --> 04:35.640]  You attack someone that's not per se violence in their definition.
[04:35.640 --> 04:38.640]  It's that you're dealing with a cycle that perpetuates itself.
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.480]  That is violence.
[04:39.480 --> 04:44.520]  And it's a great discussion that deals with, uh, sports as a representation of,
[04:44.680 --> 04:48.680]  uh, of, uh, force and violence in a controlled fashion and violence at the
[04:48.680 --> 04:49.440]  Trump rallies.
[04:49.440 --> 04:53.840]  And, uh, it's, I was blown away by it, but dueling is part of that tradition is,
[04:53.840 --> 04:58.320]  yes, it's overt violence, but it is also under very specific constraints.
[04:58.320 --> 05:02.240]  And a lot of the time, duels didn't result in anyone being hit, and that was
[05:02.240 --> 05:05.080]  the point, but everyone got to satisfy the fact that they expressed a form of
[05:05.080 --> 05:08.640]  ritualized violence without actually killing someone, but you could also kill
[05:08.640 --> 05:09.160]  somebody.
[05:09.200 --> 05:11.400]  So why did Burr and Hamilton get in a duel?
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.800]  Uh, Burr, uh, was, well, let's see, this, this is, well, you have to, you have to
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.720]  watch the musical, there we go, got a good ticket somehow, uh, spend $5,000 to
[05:20.720 --> 05:21.320]  get tickets.
[05:21.320 --> 05:25.880]  But the, the duel, the subject of the duel was that, um, uh, basically Hamilton
[05:25.880 --> 05:28.440]  was talking smack about Burr, and probably rightly so.
[05:28.440 --> 05:31.960]  Burr really shifted to whatever he needed to do, he'd done a lot of double
[05:31.960 --> 05:36.120]  dealing, um, Hamilton was not a pure character either necessarily, but he,
[05:36.120 --> 05:40.400]  uh, uh, he had been speaking publicly and privately, and I believe there was a
[05:40.400 --> 05:45.680]  specific dinner that, uh, some comments came through, so Burr wanted, uh, him to
[05:45.680 --> 05:49.280]  apologize, and Hamilton said, I'm not saying anything that's not true.
[05:49.600 --> 05:54.240]  And, uh, even though his son, Hamilton's son had been killed in a duel, uh, not
[05:54.240 --> 05:58.560]  many years before, uh, and both he and Burr had seconded, this is part of the
[05:58.560 --> 06:02.520]  musical too, had seconded another duel when they were younger, they were the
[06:02.520 --> 06:07.000]  seconds, and, uh, um, in a case that involved, uh, I think it was George
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.920]  Washington being insulted, uh, George Washington wasn't one of the parties of
[06:09.920 --> 06:10.280]  the duel.
[06:10.640 --> 06:13.920]  Uh, even with that, they went out there and there's this long-range debate, the
[06:13.920 --> 06:17.880]  musical is part of the channel biography, is whether Hamilton intended to shoot
[06:17.880 --> 06:23.080]  Burr or not, and whether Burr was reacting, uh, with intent or thought he
[06:23.080 --> 06:28.040]  was about to be shot and, and fired directly, but, uh, uh, never quite known.
[06:28.680 --> 06:30.840]  And we're talking about it 200 plus years later.
[06:30.840 --> 06:31.600]  It's amazing.
[06:32.920 --> 06:39.040]  I, the takeaway I took from school when I learned about it was that, you know,
[06:39.040 --> 06:43.480]  and again, who knows how accurate it is, but it's, it seems as though like most
[06:43.480 --> 06:47.960]  of the founding fathers were, were genuine statesmen, and then a couple of
[06:47.960 --> 06:50.040]  them were, were real hotheads.
[06:50.600 --> 06:51.520]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[06:51.520 --> 06:55.760]  Well, and they're all, I was just, I just watched the musical 1776 with my kids.
[06:55.760 --> 06:59.040]  My kids are all head up about Hamilton now and, you know, we're on the other
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.320]  coast and tickets are a fortune.
[07:00.320 --> 07:04.480]  So we will hopefully see it when it tours, you know, in a touring company to Seattle
[07:04.480 --> 07:08.800]  will probably be a B company in like four years or three years, and we'll, we'll go
[07:08.800 --> 07:09.920]  pay too much to see it here.
[07:10.240 --> 07:12.920]  Uh, but so I'm like, Hey, look, there is a musical about the founding fathers.
[07:12.920 --> 07:14.960]  Like really, really let's watch 1776.
[07:14.960 --> 07:15.840]  So we did that.
[07:15.840 --> 07:17.920]  I'd watched it for the incomparable.
[07:17.920 --> 07:21.680]  We did an old movie club a couple of years ago and watched it then.
[07:21.680 --> 07:22.480]  So I rewatch it with them.
[07:22.480 --> 07:23.200]  They loved it.
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.120]  It's all sort of focused on John Adams, primarily also Jefferson and Franklin.
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.960]  And, uh, that I always, whenever I see these things like, Oh yeah, I could go
[07:30.960 --> 07:32.480]  read some more stuff about Adams.
[07:32.480 --> 07:35.040]  Um, they're really interesting people.
[07:35.040 --> 07:36.160]  They had rich lives.
[07:36.160 --> 07:42.080]  Uh, they, they were involved in all kinds of stuff and, uh, they weren't, they, you
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.200]  know, they were all people who had their own lives and Congress was another thing.
[07:45.200 --> 07:48.800]  Um, wasn't there, wasn't, you know, as one period in their life, the continental
[07:48.800 --> 07:52.160]  Congress particularly, but, uh, I don't know, it's a fascinating, you know,
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.240]  Franklin, of course, is the fascinating when he lived a long life and, uh, like sex
[07:56.240 --> 08:00.480]  workers and mistresses and all kinds of people and lived in France and came back.
[08:00.480 --> 08:02.640]  And anyway, it's a great, they're a great bunch.
[08:04.080 --> 08:08.160]  That's the musical John Adams, apparently late in life, wrote about how he, he was
[08:08.160 --> 08:11.120]  obnoxious and disliked and late in life, he lived quite a long time.
[08:11.120 --> 08:13.200]  He and Jefferson died on the same day.
[08:13.200 --> 08:16.800]  They're bitter enemies and they died many miles apart on the same day, which is one
[08:16.800 --> 08:18.640]  of those little, and the day was July 4th.
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.320]  Yes, that's right.
[08:20.320 --> 08:20.800]  I forgot.
[08:20.800 --> 08:21.280]  You're right.
[08:21.280 --> 08:25.680]  It's the wild, but, uh, Adam's criticized his own personality late in life and the
[08:25.680 --> 08:26.560]  musical takes it up.
[08:26.560 --> 08:30.240]  There's this recurring line, you're obnoxious and disliked, you know that, sir.
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.240]  And, uh, but apparently Adams was actually quite well liked and he was viewing
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.760]  himself too harshly late in life.
[08:35.760 --> 08:37.360]  So he wasn't as obnoxious as the musical.
[08:39.200 --> 08:42.880]  Uh, also brings to mind from a comment you had a couple minutes ago, you had
[08:42.880 --> 08:47.920]  minutes ago, the Dylan song from the Traveling Woolberries, uh, in Jersey,
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.840]  everything's legal as long as you don't get caught.
[08:51.760 --> 08:52.720]  See, Hamilton is great.
[08:52.720 --> 08:57.360]  It actually pulls from musical theater, modern musical, uh, rap and hip hop.
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.680]  Uh, I heard like echoes of poems where like all of you, there's a, if you go to
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.880]  Genius, they annotate it and people have found it's not a pastiche, but he pulls.
[09:06.880 --> 09:12.880]  So Lin-Manuel Miranda is an excellent, uh, in terms of taking your ear and letting
[09:12.880 --> 09:14.160]  you hear an echo of something.
[09:14.160 --> 09:16.080]  If you're tuned in, if you're not, it sounds good.
[09:16.080 --> 09:19.760]  But if you're a big hip hop fan, you will hear, uh, you know, rhythms, patterns,
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.640]  lines, uh, the kind of characterization.
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.560]  If you're a musical theater fan, like I am, you hear all kinds of things
[09:26.560 --> 09:26.800]  throughout.
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.760]  You're like, wait, oh, you know, there's that reference to 1776.
[09:29.760 --> 09:34.080]  There's that reference to, uh, South Pacific, Rogers and Hammerstein and Sondheim
[09:34.080 --> 09:34.880]  references throughout.
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.720]  Sondheim loves it apparently, which is great.
[09:37.280 --> 09:38.000]  He loves to play.
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.120]  It's funny we're talking about the 1700s, but it's not right 1800s because so is
[09:43.120 --> 09:44.080]  Apple and the FBI.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.200]  This is what's cracking me up.
[09:45.200 --> 09:50.560]  Like what is the deal that this musical is sweeping the nation and then suddenly
[09:50.560 --> 09:53.840]  FBI is like, well, the all Ritz Act hasn't been modified for 250 years.
[09:53.840 --> 09:55.760]  But anyway, it's just the way it always works out.
[09:55.760 --> 09:57.520]  You know, these things, these things happen.
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.760]  It's the middle of this.
[09:59.760 --> 10:00.960]  It's all right.
[10:00.960 --> 10:03.840]  Serendipity is a real, it's like almost like a force.
[10:03.840 --> 10:05.040]  It is pretty amazing.
[10:05.040 --> 10:07.360]  Um, now the details of it though, it's kind of interesting.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.160]  We'll get into it again.
[10:08.160 --> 10:16.640]  But, uh, so last week the federal government filed their final brief, um, which
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.840]  Apple initially took, um, I think it's fair to say took umbrage to, um, to
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.720]  several of the angles that the government took in it.
[10:26.720 --> 10:30.800]  Um, I thought this was interesting cause I was invited, uh, to the, to the
[10:30.800 --> 10:34.320]  conference calls that reporters were on both last week and this week.
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.560]  Um, and it was a real interesting difference like last week and they do
[10:40.560 --> 10:44.640]  them very fast and it's, it's, it's obviously, and I enjoy thinking about
[10:44.640 --> 10:50.080]  this strategically, um, because I don't work fast, right?
[10:50.080 --> 10:53.360]  Daring Fireball is not a source of breaking news.
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.360]  Uh, the talk show certainly is not a source of breaking news.
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.160]  I tend to, I tend to take my time and not, not because I want to, but
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.240]  because I have to, I, my brain just doesn't work quickly.
[11:06.240 --> 11:12.400]  Um, but it's fascinating to me to look at the meta angle on it, which is
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.760]  that when these briefs drop, uh, Apple reacts very quickly.
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.600]  So last week's call, I think that it was on Friday, maybe it was Thursday,
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.680]  Thursday or Friday last week when the government put their proof out and
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.880]  Apple held the call with the, um, reporters, um, an hour later.
[11:32.880 --> 11:36.320]  So I, I certainly hadn't gotten through the brief.
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.920]  I guess Apple had, you know, the, you know, Apple's attorneys had the
[11:39.920 --> 11:41.680]  full hour before they started the call.
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.760]  And it's, I guess the, the strategy there is that they know that once the
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.280]  brief is out, the news media is some of them in the news media are gonna,
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.080]  you know, start writing takes and Apple wants to spin, get their spin on it
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.160]  out as quickly as possible. Otherwise it's too late that they have to have,
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.920]  you know, if they have to do something press relations wise quickly.
[12:07.920 --> 12:11.520]  Um, but I thought the difference between their, their,
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.680]  their, what would you call it, a hot take last week and this week is so different.
[12:15.680 --> 12:22.080]  Like it's, I detect a very cool confidence in their current argument.
[12:22.080 --> 12:24.880]  But anyway, one of the things the government put in their brief last
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.560]  week was a reference to, um, and this has, again, this is back to what's
[12:30.560 --> 12:34.720]  the year seven, 1807 chief justice Marshall, that the government claims
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.280]  once ordered a third party to quote, provide decryption services.
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.720]  I've, I went and read the original transcripts of that trial, by the way.
[12:42.720 --> 12:46.880]  Okay. That's I cannot, I did not. Oh, I want to hear about it, but that
[12:46.880 --> 12:50.800]  the government said that, uh, here's some precedent for, for compelling
[12:50.800 --> 12:55.040]  somebody to decrypt something that we can't decrypt is that chief justice
[12:55.040 --> 13:00.480]  Marshall had Aaron Burr secretary decrypt a ciphered note and apple in its
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.680]  response. Uh, was it yesterday or was it Monday? Monday? Uh, but yeah,
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.040]  Monday. No, no. Yes. Uh, yesterday. Was it yesterday? Yeah. Uh, it's all
[13:11.040 --> 13:19.600]  it's all a blur. Um, uh, says that, uh, they got, the government got it
[13:19.600 --> 13:23.840]  wrong that Marshall did nothing of the sort and that the all Ritz act had
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.360]  nothing to do, uh, was not even an issue in Burr. And what actually
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.840]  happened according to Apple's brief is that Aaron Burr secretary declined to
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.160]  state whether he quote understood the contents of a certain letter written in
[13:36.160 --> 13:38.720]  cipher on the ground that he might incriminate himself. So in other words,
[13:38.720 --> 13:42.960]  he was invoking the fifth amendment to decline to say whether he understood a
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.840]  ciphered message and what the court decided was that he could answer that
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.360]  because simply answering whether he understood the cipher would not
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.680]  incriminate him. Right. Which is fascinating if you're, you know, sort of
[13:55.680 --> 14:02.400]  a, uh, you know, like, uh, uh, like I am just sort of like broad strokes,
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.560]  like interested in civil liberties and cases like this, like edge cases around
[14:06.560 --> 14:09.440]  the fifth amendment can be fascinating. And that's an interesting one. And
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.520]  here's, you know, and it's again, what, over 200 years ago. It's a
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.160]  sophisticated question. Yeah. I mean, this is what I love living in 2016 and
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.840]  being able to pull up instantly transcripts of trials that happened over
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.280]  200 years ago. But the court anyway, the bottom line, this is from Apple's
[14:25.280 --> 14:30.000]  brief in a footnote. The court did not require the clerk to decipher the
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.480]  letter. That's correct. That's correct. It was, it was, uh, it was the, uh,
[14:34.480 --> 14:38.000]  there are two questions being put. One was, do you understand the cipher of
[14:38.000 --> 14:41.600]  that paper? Did the paper come from Colonel Burr was written by him or
[14:41.600 --> 14:45.120]  by his direction? The last question, this is, I'm reading the last question
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.560]  ought to have been first stated. The witness does not say why the answer
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.080]  to the question will the tendency to criminate him. Uh, and so it goes back
[14:52.080 --> 14:58.000]  and forth because the judge, ultimately the issue is if, uh, right. He didn't
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.760]  have to decipher it. They're asking him if he knew the contents of the letter,
[15:01.760 --> 15:06.000]  not to provide the cipher key. And in fact, just to be pedantic here, it was
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.080]  both a code and a cipher. They had a code book, actually two that's, uh,
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.040]  they Wilkinson and Burr and others have been using, uh, well, the first one
[15:13.040 --> 15:16.800]  since the 17, uh, nineties, I think. And then the later one they'd modified
[15:16.800 --> 15:20.000]  that had codes for like president and vice-president in France and so forth.
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.720]  And then there was also a simple replacement cipher that used the
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.240]  rotating letter scheme. So you'd have a, uh, letters at the top, like Cuba or
[15:26.240 --> 15:30.160]  France, peculiarly you'd take the letters, following them down, assign them
[15:30.160 --> 15:33.440]  numbers, and then you could read across the row to pick the numbers
[15:33.440 --> 15:37.680]  corresponding. So, um, you know, complicated for the day, uh, because you
[15:37.680 --> 15:41.520]  could work out simple site substitution ciphers are relatively easy to work out
[15:41.520 --> 15:45.680]  easier with computers, but definitely doable, uh, in the day. And, um, that's
[15:45.680 --> 15:48.880]  not that protected, but codes are very difficult. So with that knowledge of the
[15:48.880 --> 15:52.480]  code, uh, you can determine it from frequency of appearance and other
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.000]  characteristics. You can sometimes, uh, retrieve those, but he wasn't asked,
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.960]  do you know the cipher? It was, uh, do you, or, uh, it wasn't for the cipher.
[16:00.960 --> 16:04.560]  Right. He was asked, do you know what it said? Do you understand the contents?
[16:04.560 --> 16:10.400]  And he was concerned that, uh, any statement would allow him to, uh, it would
[16:10.400 --> 16:12.400]  provide it, but put him in a position of incrimination.
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.760]  Right. Fascinating. Um, but I have to say, it sounds to me like Apple is exactly
[16:17.760 --> 16:23.840]  right, that it's no precedent whatsoever for compelling somebody to decode and
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.320]  encrypted pretty clearly, pretty clearly anyway. So one of the interesting side
[16:28.320 --> 16:32.640]  effects of all this and of invoking things like these, this Burr case is
[16:32.640 --> 16:38.640]  this, I did not know that the founding fathers took work so commonly in use of
[16:38.640 --> 16:41.840]  codes and ciphers and stuff like that. And apparently one of the things I read
[16:41.840 --> 16:46.720]  was like the first, uh, postmaster general was like a political enemy of,
[16:46.720 --> 16:51.600]  uh, a couple of them. I forget which one I forget. You know, there's the way that
[16:51.600 --> 16:56.560]  their political things are. I get it mixed up, but long story short that they,
[16:56.560 --> 16:59.760]  they, they really felt some of them really felt like they needed to because
[16:59.760 --> 17:03.600]  they knew that this postmaster general was reading their mail. Oh yeah. That
[17:03.600 --> 17:06.640]  was a con, right. Mail was often open. It's an interesting thing that our
[17:06.640 --> 17:10.320]  current mail system, I've forgotten how far back the law goes. It might be the
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.720]  18th and 19th century, uh, that it's illegal for any party to open the mail,
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.200]  like including the post office, except with like specific warrant or, um,
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.560]  subpoena. Uh, another Hamilton musical reference by the way is Hercules
[17:22.560 --> 17:26.320]  Mulligan, best name in the world. He was transporting messages. He was not a
[17:26.320 --> 17:31.200]  loyalist, but he was sort of a spy going back and forth to New York. He was a
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.440]  textile importer, ran a clothing shop with Taylor and he and his slave whose
[17:35.440 --> 17:41.360]  name was Cato, uh, were sending messages back and forth often in a code or, um,
[17:41.360 --> 17:45.200]  in other, you know, trying to hide the meaning of it eventually became too
[17:45.200 --> 17:49.120]  dangerous, but he's one of the reason that they were able to, uh, to, uh,
[17:49.120 --> 17:53.200]  Hamilton was able to assist general Washington in, uh, some of the battles
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.120]  around Manhattan. It's amazing. It is an amazing name. Hercules Mulligan,
[17:57.120 --> 18:00.560]  Hercules Mulligan. It's awesome. It's great partner in the play, but yeah,
[18:00.560 --> 18:03.040]  co I mean, code's been an important part. I think I forget what the earliest
[18:03.040 --> 18:07.600]  cryptographic stuff is. There's the, there's a thing of wrapping, uh, a strip
[18:07.600 --> 18:11.200]  of paper around a cylinder of a certain dimension, like a pencil size thing that
[18:11.200 --> 18:14.640]  was used. So you could write across it and then unfurl it. Unless you knew the
[18:14.640 --> 18:17.280]  dimensions, you wouldn't be able to figure it out. Oh yeah. I've seen that.
[18:17.280 --> 18:21.280]  I've seen that. And that's, I think one of the earliest uses of, uh, of crypto
[18:21.280 --> 18:24.160]  and simple cipher substitution, if you don't know what it is and, you know,
[18:24.160 --> 18:28.400]  it's only become more complicated over time, but code has a, uh, code and
[18:28.400 --> 18:33.200]  interception of code and, um, uh, people being executed for possession of what
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.200]  was seen as code that was never deciphered all big issues for many, for
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.560]  thousands of years. When I was a kid, I got, I spent a couple, I mean, it's been
[18:40.560 --> 18:43.600]  a long time. I was truly like, you know, like grade school age, but I spent like,
[18:43.600 --> 18:47.520]  you know, at one point, one of my obsessions became codes and stuff like
[18:47.520 --> 18:51.040]  that. And I very, I specifically remember that one where you wrap the
[18:51.040 --> 18:58.880]  paper around like a ruler type thing of a certain known width. And, um, and
[18:58.880 --> 19:02.640]  then when you unwrap it, it just looks like gibberish. And again, like you
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.320]  said, that's not the most secure. It's obvious. Nobody else knows it though.
[19:06.320 --> 19:08.960]  If you don't have sophistication on the other side, it's, uh, people are like,
[19:08.960 --> 19:13.920]  why does someone write gibberish? Uh, I have a very vivid memory. I, uh,
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.880]  I'm almost certain I was in first grade, but it was certainly like first or
[19:18.880 --> 19:26.240]  second, uh, that Kellogg's had a, a campaign and that three or four of
[19:26.240 --> 19:34.320]  their like flagship, uh, kitty serials had little, um, uh, little plastic
[19:34.320 --> 19:39.360]  things in them. So like the two cans, Sam one might be blue and, uh, the,
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.520]  the frosted flakes, Tony, the tiger one was yellow and maybe the sugar
[19:43.520 --> 19:47.200]  smacks one was red, you know, with the ribbit rabbit or whatever his name was
[19:47.200 --> 19:51.120]  or ribbit, the frog, you know what I mean? Uh, but there'd be, so there'd be
[19:51.120 --> 19:57.120]  different colors and then you would, they were all just a different, uh, like 26
[19:57.120 --> 20:01.600]  character cipher, you know, where it would just be a different rotation, you
[20:01.600 --> 20:05.120]  know, sort of like rot. It was like a rot 13, but you know, Tony, the tigers
[20:05.120 --> 20:10.160]  was rot 17 and the frog one was rot 11 or something like that. But I was
[20:10.160 --> 20:14.560]  fascinated. I, as a first grader, I felt pretty clever that I figured out the
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.880]  differences between them. Um, but then it was cool because then we, it was it,
[20:19.680 --> 20:22.880]  like with friends at school, we could send coded messages to each other and it
[20:22.880 --> 20:26.000]  took so long, spend, you know, spinning the disc. It would just be like,
[20:27.680 --> 20:34.080]  then ultimately drink your oval team. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Like, uh, I
[20:34.080 --> 20:38.640]  thought it's called the script scriptali is the, uh, Greek, uh, rod that was used
[20:38.640 --> 20:41.760]  for encryption with a substitutions diaper. I knew there is something that's
[20:41.760 --> 20:46.560]  not the earliest Egyptians were maybe a thousand years before, for that. Um,
[20:46.560 --> 20:50.080]  there's also a famous story of, uh, the word shibboleth, you know, it was a
[20:50.080 --> 20:55.040]  great story. It's not about code per se, but it's spies in a camp, uh, some might
[20:55.040 --> 21:00.320]  camp. And, um, the leader says, uh, say you now shibboleth and the spies were
[21:00.320 --> 21:04.160]  unable to pronounce the sh sound. And they said, Sibboleth and were put to
[21:04.160 --> 21:08.320]  death. So a shibboleth is like that passphrase, like a thing you say to be
[21:08.320 --> 21:12.720]  shown that you're a member of a tribe, always like that. Hmm. These divisions
[21:12.720 --> 21:17.040]  go back thousands of years. So probably the origin of being able to put words on
[21:17.040 --> 21:19.920]  paper, people were figuring out ways to make other people not be able to read
[21:19.920 --> 21:23.600]  those right. Well, to communicate at length, right? Yeah. Because you could
[21:23.600 --> 21:26.960]  always communicate in private. Well, I mean, I mean, obviously you could, if
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.640]  your room is bugged or whatever, there's, there's ways around, but if you, if
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.640]  you're reasonably secure that your room is the room or you're in is not being
[21:34.640 --> 21:37.680]  bugged, you can have a private conversation with somebody that, that
[21:37.680 --> 21:40.640]  the trick is, how do you have a private conversation with somebody at a
[21:40.640 --> 21:44.880]  distance? And it's like you said, it's long as we've been communicating at a
[21:44.880 --> 21:48.240]  distance, even if it's like, just be, you know, by sending, dispatching a
[21:48.240 --> 21:52.240]  messenger there, there've been codes. Yeah. I mean, you're saying there might
[21:52.240 --> 21:58.160]  be warrant proof spaces is, uh, exactly possibly in our minds. My grandparents,
[21:58.160 --> 22:01.600]  uh, my family was a furniture ran furniture stores for many, many years.
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.840]  And my grandfather developed a code, a number code, 10 letter code based on our
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.600]  last name and his mother's initial. So they could put the retail or the
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.400]  wholesale price of things in the tags that customers knowing. So when they
[22:12.400 --> 22:17.520]  negotiate, they knew exactly how low they could go. See clever fell out. My
[22:17.520 --> 22:21.680]  grandpa. Very, very clever. Um, boy, that's the type of thing that nowadays,
[22:21.680 --> 22:27.440]  uh, uh, people, you know, eventually some consumer website would come out with
[22:27.440 --> 22:31.360]  the, uh, yeah, go into this mattress store and here's how you decode exactly
[22:31.360 --> 22:34.960]  you know, they can go. Yeah. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our
[22:34.960 --> 22:39.520]  first sponsor. It's our good friends at Casper. You guys know Casper. They sell
[22:39.520 --> 22:43.840]  mattresses online, obsessively engineered mattresses at shockingly fair
[22:43.840 --> 22:48.640]  prices. Um, here's one of the, here's my favorite thing about, uh, Casper
[22:48.640 --> 22:52.560]  mattresses. They don't make you choose between like two, three, four, five, six,
[22:52.560 --> 22:55.920]  seven different types of mattresses or the technologies in them. No, they
[22:55.920 --> 22:59.440]  figured it out for you. Just the right sink, just the right bounce. They've
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.080]  taken two commonly used mattress technologies, latex foam and memory foam.
[23:04.080 --> 23:09.520]  And they've made their own custom cocktail between the two for better
[23:09.520 --> 23:13.840]  nights and better days. Good sleep. So all you do is pick what size you want.
[23:13.840 --> 23:17.440]  So you know what size bed you have. So you just go there, you need a new
[23:17.440 --> 23:22.400]  mattress, get the right size. Um, and as crazy as it sounds, I know I've said
[23:22.400 --> 23:25.120]  this every time they sponsored the show. It sounds crazy to buy a mattress
[23:25.120 --> 23:28.480]  without like trying it out. But what kind of a tryout do you actually get in
[23:28.480 --> 23:31.360]  a retail store anyway? It's actually kind of gross because other people have
[23:31.360 --> 23:34.800]  slept on it. All right. And just like being there with all of your clothes on
[23:34.800 --> 23:38.640]  and laying on a bed for two or three minutes isn't going to tell you how you
[23:38.640 --> 23:42.800]  sleep on it. So actually the way that Casper does it, if you think about it,
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.320]  it's a traditional, but it makes a lot more sense. They have a risk free trial
[23:46.320 --> 23:52.560]  and return policy. You try sleeping on a Casper for a hundred days. And if you
[23:52.560 --> 23:56.640]  don't like it up to a hundred days, they'll do, you just call them up, uh, go
[23:56.640 --> 23:59.840]  to the website and they'll take care of free. They'll just take it right back.
[23:59.840 --> 24:04.640]  No, no questions asked. Um, I've even heard from a listener of the show, he
[24:04.640 --> 24:08.800]  sent me an email and said that, uh, that they did it and that they bought it
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.960]  because it was on the show. And it was like, for whatever reason, wasn't,
[24:12.960 --> 24:18.000]  wasn't to their liking. And it, and, and, uh, said, and it just wanted to say,
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.960]  I know you keep saying that they take them back, but it literally was as easy
[24:20.960 --> 24:24.880]  as could possibly be to take a mattress back. Um, here's the, some of their
[24:24.880 --> 24:28.480]  prices. It retail, you go retail for mattresses. You're probably going to pay
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.800]  like $1,500 or more for a premium mattress. Casper's start at 500 for a
[24:32.800 --> 24:38.560]  twin, uh, seven 50 for full eight 50 for queen and just 950 bucks for a King
[24:38.560 --> 24:42.560]  size mattress. So you just can't lose. Here's where you go. For more
[24:42.560 --> 24:50.720]  information, go to casper.com C I S P E R.com slash the talk show and use
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.200]  that code, the, the talk show, and you'll save 50 bucks off. They're already
[24:55.200 --> 24:59.040]  excellent prices, free shipping to you, free shipping back. If you want to send
[24:59.040 --> 25:07.840]  it back, uh, and great prices, casper.com slash the talk show. Uh, so I guess we
[25:07.840 --> 25:13.200]  should talk in detail about the, the apple FBI case. Yeah. And then we can
[25:13.200 --> 25:16.160]  speculate because I feel like this is the one thing, this is the thing. I mean,
[25:16.160 --> 25:19.120]  we can talk about next week's event and what our last minute speculation is,
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.360]  whatever, but that's it. You know, it's interesting, but it's of the moment.
[25:23.360 --> 25:28.880]  Whereas the, the Apple FBI thing is, is truly, I don't think it's hyperbole. I
[25:28.880 --> 25:33.680]  think it's genuinely important to the future of the Republic. I am absolutely
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.880]  with you. I think it's actually one of the most fundamental issues of privacy
[25:36.880 --> 25:41.760]  we could possibly be facing now and we have the best advocate on our side. Uh,
[25:41.760 --> 25:46.080]  and the government is extremely disappointed. The Obama administration
[25:46.080 --> 25:53.280]  stance, I feel like we're, we're being sold out because, um, rich mogul has this
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.280]  line. I've talked to him about it and he says, it's not on my watch is the, is
[25:57.280 --> 26:00.320]  what is driving it. He says he's worked with law enforcement a lot. He's a lot
[26:00.320 --> 26:05.760]  of good takes on this subject. And he said, nobody wants to be the guy when the
[26:05.760 --> 26:08.320]  event happens and you could have done something else and you didn't do
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.560]  everything. So the FBI is doing this scorched earth policy to break apart this
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.080]  thing. They try to find a test case because James Comey and a few other
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.160]  people are saying, this is not going to be the thing where we lose. Not, I am not
[26:20.160 --> 26:23.120]  going to be the person responsible for the next terrorist event. So I'm going to
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.560]  do everything even if potentially it threatens Liberty. That's not my concern.
[26:26.560 --> 26:30.240]  My concern is preventing this attack. And I think it's true too. I think
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.600]  they're being such bulldogs about it. Uh, it, but I, I agree with you. I think
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.360]  this is a, it's a, that you've, you've been writing about this, I think in a
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.000]  wonderful way. The warrant proof spaces is a big issue. And Comey said that, uh,
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.600]  and then Jonathan Zajarski has been writing about this too. He's just wrote
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.360]  recently about how there are many warrant proof spaces in America, American
[26:49.360 --> 26:53.680]  law and the constitution, uh, state laws carve out lots of places in which
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.800]  warrants aren't allowed. Great post. Um, but, uh, are we allowed only the privacy
[26:58.800 --> 27:01.280]  of our own mind? What, here's the thing, you know, you and I were talking about
[27:01.280 --> 27:05.600]  this on Twitter is there's all these natural extensions. Should ISPs preserve
[27:05.600 --> 27:09.520]  every email you ever sent? Like, can we delete email permanently? Um, what if
[27:09.520 --> 27:12.160]  there were brain scanners? What if brain scans existed tomorrow? There's
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.000]  technology starting to be able to pull images out of people's heads. Right. Is
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.520]  that, I mean, would they be allowed to use that on a suspect in custody? Like
[27:21.520 --> 27:24.240]  it's not science fiction. It's not science fiction. We're seeing, I mean,
[27:24.240 --> 27:26.800]  people are showing, they're actually like having some glimmerings of this,
[27:26.800 --> 27:30.080]  where it's real. It's something that's not telepathy. It's science in a lab
[27:30.080 --> 27:33.600]  they can show. And so, holy cow, you know, this isn't impractical,
[27:33.600 --> 27:39.440]  theoretically. Could they compel a, a criminal suspect to, to have like a
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.760]  brain scan and ask them questions sort of like a, like where today it's a lie
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.200]  detector test, but just imagine like, what is the passcode to your phone?
[27:47.200 --> 27:50.960]  What's the passcode to your phone? And if they read a number out of the guy's
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.200]  head and try it and it works, is that admit? No, but I mean, I don't think that
[27:55.200 --> 27:58.720]  that's it. I know they, I don't think they can do that today to my knowledge.
[27:58.720 --> 28:03.040]  There's no such device today, but that does not seem like it's unreasonable
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.040]  even within the scope of your and my lifetimes. I mean, in terms of the way
[28:07.040 --> 28:10.560]  that, that, that we're starting to understand the brain. And I've said this
[28:10.560 --> 28:14.880]  before. I said this on the show and I really, it, to me, it really, it's
[28:14.880 --> 28:21.840]  interesting. What if, what if the, some future computing device that provides
[28:21.840 --> 28:26.480]  capabilities like what we use today with an iPhone, what if it's embedded in your
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.320]  body? What if it's something that you place in your wrist? What if it's
[28:30.320 --> 28:37.360]  something you do put in your head, right? What, what if it's, and again, I, I, I'm
[28:37.360 --> 28:41.840]  not an expert on Alzheimer's and I know that there are some, some biological, you
[28:41.840 --> 28:46.560]  know, the solutions or, or improvements to Alzheimer's research going on. But
[28:46.560 --> 28:51.440]  what if, you know, somebody 10, 15, 20 years from now invents some kind of very
[28:51.440 --> 28:58.320]  small system on a chip that can be embedded in somebody's brain to help
[28:58.320 --> 29:04.160]  with the, the, the cognitive decline and the dementia that's caused by
[29:04.160 --> 29:10.080]  Alzheimer's? It, would that device therefore, you know, then be susceptible
[29:10.080 --> 29:17.440]  to the government reading the contents of it? To me, you know, it, it's not
[29:18.160 --> 29:22.320]  preposterous to, to pose hypotheticals like that. And my answer would be no, you
[29:22.320 --> 29:26.560]  know, that it's, it's no different than, there's not that much difference. And
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.080]  it's going to be less as time goes on between artificial digital devices and
[29:32.800 --> 29:39.200]  our capability of reading the, you know, the, the mechanic, you know, treating
[29:39.200 --> 29:41.920]  our brains as the mechanical devices they are at a certain level.
[29:42.640 --> 29:45.840]  It's, it's also, I think the warrant proof space is a great metaphor because
[29:45.840 --> 29:51.360]  in fact, every place we have in, in our brains and in reality that we own are
[29:51.360 --> 29:54.880]  all warrant proof spaces until a warrant is produced. And I think there's this
[29:54.880 --> 29:58.400]  interesting thing where the view of the FBI, as they've expressed it in the
[29:58.400 --> 30:01.840]  Department of Justice, is that all spaces are open to the government on
[30:01.840 --> 30:05.200]  demand. And that is simply not, I mean, it is, it's both true and not true.
[30:05.200 --> 30:08.240]  People can also express civil disobedience and be jailed for contempt
[30:08.240 --> 30:11.760]  or for violating court orders or other charges. They can go to jail for
[30:11.760 --> 30:16.000]  refusing. You have a lot of people who have nobly in the past, sometimes
[30:16.000 --> 30:21.040]  unknowably, gone to jail rather than give up information or, or access or
[30:21.040 --> 30:25.520]  locations of things. I think by default, we should assume that all places
[30:25.520 --> 30:29.360]  are private. I think this notion, I think Zajarski wrote about this also,
[30:29.360 --> 30:34.240]  is that the Bill of Rights is not a instructions on what the government can
[30:34.240 --> 30:40.000]  do. It's instructions on what citizens' rights are, and it prescribes the
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.280]  government from doing so much. So it's not a plan to use to circumvent rights.
[30:45.280 --> 30:49.840]  It's a giant wall to prohibit the government from excess. And so the idea
[30:49.840 --> 30:53.120]  that every space we own is really owned by the government is terrifying. I
[30:53.120 --> 30:56.720]  mean, that's really, you know, it's a very much a conservative and far right
[30:56.720 --> 31:00.960]  view that the government, you know, any Democrat elected government would
[31:00.960 --> 31:04.400]  be, have that in place. So the government owns all spaces. So they're
[31:04.400 --> 31:07.760]  playing into the hands at some point of that. And I think people who are on
[31:07.760 --> 31:12.160]  the left of the spectrum would say also that even if they believe in a bigger
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.640]  role for government or different nature of government regulation and
[31:14.640 --> 31:18.720]  control, that the government having sort of a de facto right to all of our
[31:18.720 --> 31:22.560]  private spaces, our homes, our computers, and, you know, by extension our
[31:22.560 --> 31:28.320]  minds, that that also is not in keeping with the nature of what, you know,
[31:28.320 --> 31:32.320]  civil human rights are being, are and it would be in the nature of our
[31:32.320 --> 31:37.360]  country. So, I mean, you come down to this, it's like what percentage of
[31:37.360 --> 31:42.080]  iPhones are used for crime? You know, it's 0.00 whatever percent. And the
[31:42.080 --> 31:46.240]  idea that all iPhones have to be open to inspection at any time, like bags
[31:46.240 --> 31:49.760]  going through an x-ray machine or the TSA with their locks that have now
[31:49.760 --> 31:54.240]  been duplicated because they allowed photos to be taken of the master keys,
[31:54.240 --> 31:57.840]  like that's what the FBI is proposing is we'll have a way for, you know, the
[31:57.840 --> 32:01.600]  TSA style investigators to get in, which means everyone can get in.
[32:01.600 --> 32:07.360]  Right. And there's a, the part that to me is the most disappointing, single
[32:07.360 --> 32:12.960]  most disappointing in the Obama administration. And, you know, I'll just
[32:12.960 --> 32:18.240]  admit it, and Hillary Clinton has espoused the same opinion, is a belief in
[32:18.240 --> 32:22.000]  this magical thinking that if we just put smart enough people into a room
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.480]  together that they can come up with a way that this would, this back door
[32:26.480 --> 32:30.400]  solution would only be available to law enforcement. That we're not asking you
[32:30.400 --> 32:34.160]  to make a back door that anybody could get into, we just want a back door that
[32:34.160 --> 32:39.040]  law enforcement can get into when we have a warrant, which sounds reasonable
[32:39.040 --> 32:44.240]  and in some, you know, fictional other universe where that's mathematically
[32:44.240 --> 32:49.360]  possible, that might be great. I actually, I think that there's good reasons why a
[32:49.360 --> 32:54.160]  civil libertarian would be opposed even to that. I, like, like, let me just put
[32:54.160 --> 32:58.720]  this out there that, and, and I tend to lean that way. I would listen to the
[32:58.720 --> 33:02.560]  argument, but I tend to lean towards, even if that were possible, I don't
[33:02.560 --> 33:06.320]  think it's a good idea. And I think it's contrary to the values that are already
[33:06.320 --> 33:10.960]  in our Bill of Rights. But it is an idea. But the simple truth is that it's math,
[33:10.960 --> 33:14.800]  all experts agree, everybody who understands encryption, I mean, this is
[33:14.800 --> 33:22.480]  it, I don't think that you, it's more than even like, I mean, it's, it's, like,
[33:22.480 --> 33:25.840]  provably incorrect, you know, like, as opposed to, let's say, climate change,
[33:25.840 --> 33:30.880]  where you can say, you can argue that only 98 or 99% of expert climate
[33:30.880 --> 33:35.280]  scientists agree that the, you know, what we're seeing is manmade. I mean, with
[33:35.280 --> 33:39.360]  with cryptography and backdoors, it's 100% agreement, because of that.
[33:40.080 --> 33:43.360]  You're totally right. I just realized I haven't seen any, any crypto deniers out
[33:43.360 --> 33:46.880]  there saying this is possible. I've only seen politicians in law enforcement.
[33:46.880 --> 33:48.720]  Right. That's fascinating.
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.440]  Well, that's part of the beauty of trying to convince my 12-year-old son of it. I'm
[33:53.440 --> 33:56.880]  trying to convince, when I talk to my 12-year-old son, who does not have the
[33:56.880 --> 34:01.440]  enthusiasm for mathematics that I did, that that's the beauty of mathematics.
[34:01.440 --> 34:07.360]  It's, it's, you know, and, and in a way that computer science sort of falls out
[34:07.360 --> 34:10.400]  of mathematics, I could go on a long run here, like, when I went to Drexel,
[34:11.040 --> 34:14.000]  and got my degree in computer science, it was from the Department of
[34:15.680 --> 34:19.120]  Math and Computer Science. It was one department for mathematics and computer
[34:19.120 --> 34:22.720]  science. And it, well, they've since broken it out. And now computer science
[34:22.720 --> 34:25.600]  is often, I don't know what they did, but it's
[34:25.600 --> 34:27.200]  An expensive new building, probably.
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.600]  Yeah, I think that, I think that what happened is that politically the computer
[34:31.600 --> 34:36.320]  science department grew to, you know, it used to be like, it was the math
[34:36.320 --> 34:38.640]  department with a little kooky computer science
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.000]  group of professors, and then computer science got so popular and so important
[34:44.000 --> 34:48.000]  to our society that it grew off. But anyway, I just thought, and it's not just
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.120]  because I went to Drexel where they put them together. It just made sense to me,
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.560]  though, that when you type a computer program, and it either works or doesn't
[34:54.560 --> 34:59.520]  work, there's a certain beauty to that. And I think a lot of the people who
[34:59.520 --> 35:02.320]  listen to the show are probably nodding their heads, like that's why they got
[35:02.320 --> 35:04.960]  into this racket, because there's a
[35:04.960 --> 35:08.480]  Statistics lie, math doesn't.
[35:08.480 --> 35:14.080]  Right. Correct. And it's, you know, it's just disappointing to me that they keep,
[35:14.080 --> 35:17.840]  you know, pushing back on that. There was a, there's a line that Apple's
[35:17.840 --> 35:21.680]  attorneys used. It was in the sort of off the record.
[35:21.680 --> 35:24.400]  You can paraphrase, you know, the rules were from the call that you can
[35:24.400 --> 35:30.160]  paraphrase it, not quote it directly, but the gist of it was that, that they talk
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.920]  to US law enforcement frequently, and they are happy to do so and happy to
[35:35.920 --> 35:40.480]  work with the government, and that they are, of course, you know, opposed to
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.600]  terrorism and crime and all this stuff, and that they are also happy to, you
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.680]  know, willing and happy to comply with warrants and provide information that
[35:49.680 --> 35:54.960]  they have. But that every time they meet with law enforcement about this
[35:54.960 --> 35:59.120]  issue, law enforcement, US law enforcement, comes at the discussion
[35:59.120 --> 36:06.640]  with the angle of, how can you let us into the iPhone? And never wants to
[36:06.640 --> 36:12.320]  discuss the question of, should we be able to get into the iPhone? It's just
[36:12.320 --> 36:18.960]  not it. They're intransigent, intransigent on the point of, you know,
[36:18.960 --> 36:21.200]  on the point of, how do we get into the iPhone?
[36:21.200 --> 36:24.640]  Oh, here, let me give you a good thought experiment, because I think
[36:24.640 --> 36:29.120]  there's this issue where people, I want to say that I keep stating on the
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.560]  Macworld podcast and everywhere, I keep saying, look, I absolutely support
[36:32.560 --> 36:35.120]  the right of a legal warrant. I don't like extrajudicial stuff. I don't
[36:35.120 --> 36:39.360]  like the FISA court. I don't like extra constitutional things, illegal
[36:39.360 --> 36:43.840]  rendition, all that stuff. I like the legality of the constitutionally
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.160]  created warrants, right? And I think the FBI should be seeking every
[36:48.160 --> 36:52.080]  available reasonable means, and sometimes even almost unreasonable
[36:52.080 --> 36:54.320]  with a court holding them in check so they don't violate the
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.080]  constitution. Totally support that. I am absolutely a, I want to trust the
[36:58.080 --> 37:00.240]  government. The government isn't always trustworthy, but I believe it's
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.360]  the best system we have to ensure justice. We need to improve the quality
[37:03.360 --> 37:06.640]  of justice as opposed to constraining them from being able to use tools
[37:06.640 --> 37:10.800]  that are legal and courts oversee in a public way that is fair and
[37:10.800 --> 37:14.480]  whatever. So here's the thought experiment. I was reading a paper,
[37:14.480 --> 37:19.120]  academic paper a year or so ago. You know that cameras and cell phones
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.560]  and DSLRs are so good now that they can extract a face from the
[37:24.560 --> 37:28.960]  reflection in an object in the subject. So you're taking a
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.960]  picture, you're behind the camera, a reflection, even minute in anything
[37:32.960 --> 37:36.480]  you're taking a picture of, can be reconstructed to provide a decent
[37:36.480 --> 37:40.240]  facial match against you. And this is today, right? This is a couple
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.840]  of years ago, actually. So when we have 20 megapixel or 50 megapixel
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.120]  or photographic, computational photographic equipment and everything,
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.640]  our iPhones will have seven cameras on them, whatever, right? So here's
[37:50.640 --> 37:53.120]  the picture, here's the scenario. And this is where I think we would
[37:53.120 --> 37:57.840]  agree on, but let's find out is that FBI or law enforcement says, ah, we
[37:57.840 --> 38:01.680]  know there were several people in the vicinity of this event and they
[38:01.680 --> 38:04.640]  were taking pictures. We believe we could recover the face from a
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.400]  reflection of the actual criminal and they subpoena the phones or they,
[38:08.400 --> 38:11.200]  you know, they demand them. They want to abuse them as evidence. In my
[38:11.200 --> 38:15.680]  view, I think that's totally legitimate. Now, could those people be
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.840]  compelled under All-Rits Act to provide it? Maybe not. Maybe they
[38:17.840 --> 38:21.200]  would say yes, maybe they'd say no. That request to want those photos
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.240]  and people handing over those photos thinking they were legally obliged
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.080]  to aid in this, that seems reasonable to me where the line would be
[38:28.080 --> 38:31.120]  crossed as if, like in this case, they said, oh, we need to use the
[38:31.120 --> 38:34.240]  All-Rits Act to break the encryption because some of the witnesses
[38:34.240 --> 38:37.280]  refuse to turn over their phones. We think there's a picture of the
[38:37.280 --> 38:39.120]  killer in that scene. What do you think?
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.120]  I agree. It's, you know, that's exactly what a warrant is, in my
[38:43.120 --> 38:48.240]  opinion. You know, you can, you ask for permission to search whatever,
[38:48.240 --> 38:55.680]  a room, a house, a filing cabinet, a digital device, and what they can
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.040]  get off it, they can get off it. But if all they get off it is a
[39:01.280 --> 39:05.680]  strongly encrypted jumble of ones and zeros, that's tough.
[39:05.680 --> 39:08.560]  Yeah. I mean, that's, and I, yeah, so that's, that's the thing. I mean,
[39:08.560 --> 39:11.120]  this is a different, it's a sort of parallel case, you know, where it's,
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.920]  but I think we're going to see, I think based on this, we're going to
[39:13.920 --> 39:16.000]  see a lot more use of the All-Rits Act. And I think they're going to
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.360]  be like that. And I think a lot of citizens or small companies or even
[39:19.360 --> 39:23.360]  bigger companies are going to feel compelled to do it to obey. And I
[39:23.360 --> 39:25.840]  think the precedent set here will affect things like that. There will
[39:25.840 --> 39:28.720]  be, you know, what it is, is I think there's going to be a massively
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.880]  increasing number of cases in which people who are innocent bystanders,
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.400]  bystanders will have evidence that will be useful because of digital
[39:36.400 --> 39:40.080]  data collection, audio or video images or anything else.
[39:40.080 --> 39:44.320]  But that's also a very different thing than compelling innocent
[39:44.320 --> 39:50.160]  bystanders to take action, to say, to, to, for example, say this, you
[39:50.160 --> 39:54.720]  know, we have reason to believe that you know, some sort of crime is
[39:54.720 --> 40:00.640]  going to be committed in this area. Therefore we, you know and I'm
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.280]  telling you, this is exactly the path that this sort of precedent can
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.560]  go down. We want the right to turn on the camera and recording of every
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.680]  every iPhone, you know, in range of this cell tower.
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.360]  Panopticon OS.
[40:17.360 --> 40:20.240]  Right. And only, you know, here we have, you know, it's, we're not
[40:20.240 --> 40:22.400]  saying everywhere, you know, anywhere and everywhere. We're saying
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.160]  right here in the vicinity of, you know, whatever street and whatever
[40:26.160 --> 40:30.800]  city. But we have good reason for it and therefore we should, you know,
[40:30.800 --> 40:33.440]  we require the ability to do this.
[40:33.440 --> 40:36.080]  That is very much within the realm of what people would ask. I mean,
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.040]  look, that's already happening with cars. We know that law enforcement
[40:39.040 --> 40:42.080]  wants to get information on their cars. Look, I was talking to car
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.520]  makers last year about, you know, car robots, self-driving cars. And
[40:47.520 --> 40:50.320]  the deal is like, this is the thing to keep coming back to, what we are
[40:50.320 --> 40:53.680]  seeing today is the tip of the iceberg of data collection, both us
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.880]  watching the watchmen, the watchmen watching us. And it seems like it's
[40:56.880 --> 41:00.000]  already ridiculous, right? In the future, our clothing is going to be
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.400]  covered with cameras. I mean, I'm exaggerating, but like everything,
[41:02.400 --> 41:05.360]  cars are going to be festooned. But one of the limitations, there's a
[41:05.360 --> 41:08.880]  point at which you can have too many cameras on a car, you're collecting
[41:08.880 --> 41:12.160]  too much information. That point has not been hit yet. I think if the,
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.440]  in because of computational photography, where you can combine images
[41:15.440 --> 41:19.440]  for many cameras or different kinds of imagery from cameras to obtain
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.560]  more information, like, you know, we talk about 3D cameras on cars.
[41:22.560 --> 41:27.120]  They're really 2D stereoscopic cameras. They're RGB plus depth and
[41:27.120 --> 41:30.400]  use infrared or laser for ranging. That kind of information, you can
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.120]  also obtain in some cases, if you have more cameras, you don't need
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.600]  the ranging part. There's all these things are going to happen. So at
[41:35.600 --> 41:37.040]  some point our camera, our cars are going to happen.
[41:37.040 --> 41:39.360]  Yeah, you can triangulate the three-dimensional aspects of it from the
[41:39.360 --> 41:40.560]  two different angles.
[41:40.560 --> 41:42.880]  Yeah. And there's seen some really, some really interesting papers. So
[41:42.880 --> 41:45.600]  at some point we are going to, our phones are going to be recording a
[41:45.600 --> 41:47.920]  hundred percent of the time. We're going to be having wearable devices,
[41:47.920 --> 41:50.720]  if they're watch or watches or whatever, they're constantly ready
[41:50.720 --> 41:54.400]  and on recording video and audio, unless we disable them. And everything
[41:54.400 --> 41:57.360]  is going to be constantly recording and streaming terabytes of data
[41:57.360 --> 42:00.640]  that's actually going to be processed to pull out information. So we are
[42:00.640 --> 42:03.440]  going into a future and with what you're describing as reality, there
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.480]  could be a continuous 3D like coverage in any area of any minimal
[42:08.480 --> 42:12.720]  population density between Nest Cam style things and our phones and
[42:12.720 --> 42:15.920]  watches and cars. So what if the government wants to compel that? We
[42:15.920 --> 42:19.360]  need like 10 minutes in an hour. Hit this button and every camera's
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.880]  records that for the next 10 minutes and they get, you know, terabyte of
[42:22.880 --> 42:24.560]  information or a petabyte from that.
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.640]  Yeah. I could skip over, you know, skipping around a little bit, but I
[42:28.640 --> 42:32.560]  think it applies. But one of the highlights I have in Apple's brief
[42:32.560 --> 42:39.280]  yesterday was from talking about this CALEA law, C-A-L-E-A.
[42:39.280 --> 42:40.480]  Yeah, that was really fascinating.
[42:40.480 --> 42:45.760]  And the government is sort of arguing that CALEA doesn't apply to Apple
[42:45.760 --> 42:51.120]  in this case. And Apple is arguing, yes, it exactly applies to us.
[42:51.120 --> 42:51.600]  Yes.
[42:51.600 --> 42:57.520]  And one of them, here's the passage I highlighted. CALEA's legislative
[42:57.520 --> 43:00.960]  history makes clear the sound policy reasons behind its specific
[43:00.960 --> 43:05.040]  limitations on when decryption services can be required. During
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.160]  congressional hearings on CALEA, then FBI Director Louis Freeh assured
[43:10.160 --> 43:15.920]  Senator Leahy, that's Pat Leahy from Vermont, that CALEA would not
[43:15.920 --> 43:19.920]  impede the growth of new technologies. When Senator Leahy asked whether
[43:19.920 --> 43:25.520]  CALEA would inhibit the growth of encryption, Freeh responded, quote,
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.160]  this legislation does not ask companies to decrypt. It just tells them
[43:30.160 --> 43:35.360]  to give us the bits as they have them. If they are encrypted, that is
[43:35.360 --> 43:40.400]  my problem. Which is what I'm saying, is that, yes, I think that the FBI
[43:40.400 --> 43:42.960]  should have the rights to get the contents of this suspect's phone.
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.280]  But if the contents of the phone are scrambled and the FBI is technically
[43:47.280 --> 43:52.880]  incapable of decrypting them, that's their problem. And I don't say that
[43:52.880 --> 43:58.240]  to be callous. In terms of, wow, what if in some other hypothetical
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.000]  case the information would actually prove useful to getting a conviction
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.600]  of someone who actually did something? Or what if it was some sort of
[44:05.600 --> 44:08.320]  information on a phone that they can't access would have information
[44:08.320 --> 44:11.200]  that could prevent something in the future? I mean, those things will
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.440]  happen, but there is no perfect solution.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.920]  Yeah, I want to circle back about this, too. When we talk about the
[44:19.920 --> 44:22.720]  political spectrum, it applies directly here, too, is that it's
[44:22.720 --> 44:25.520]  hilarious to see people all the way on the spectrum from, say,
[44:25.520 --> 44:31.920]  anarchist to, you know, right-wing fundamentalists, who are absolute
[44:31.920 --> 44:32.560]  libertarian.
[44:33.360 --> 44:34.720]  I love that aspect of this.
[44:34.720 --> 44:37.120]  But the cryptographer, because the cryptographic community has
[44:37.120 --> 44:40.560]  people across a larger political spectrum than I think almost who
[44:40.560 --> 44:43.440]  are prominent in it, let's say, than almost any other field of
[44:43.440 --> 44:46.880]  endeavor I can imagine. So you've got Whitfield Diffie, you've got
[44:46.880 --> 44:54.240]  Moxie Marlenspike, you've got David, what's his face, Robert Graham
[44:54.240 --> 44:59.840]  from Rattus Security. You've got people across a huge spectrum,
[44:59.840 --> 45:03.840]  right? And some people have come from dictatorship-based societies
[45:03.840 --> 45:06.160]  and escaped them. Some are living in societies that are becoming
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.000]  repressive. Some are in democracies or extensible democracies. And
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.320]  they're all like, yeah, okay. I mean, there's different reasons
[45:12.320 --> 45:14.960]  to argue about this. Some people may or may not be in favor of a
[45:14.960 --> 45:17.920]  backdoor. None of them disagree over what you're saying. There is
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.480]  no way to create that. And so if you're an anarchist or a raging
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.520]  libertarian, you've got the same view, like, nah, can't be done.
[45:26.080 --> 45:29.440]  I really enjoyed, I keep pondering it over my head, Rich Mogul's
[45:29.440 --> 45:32.000]  description of it, that it's sort of a cover-your-ass mentality,
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.960]  or like you're seeing his words are not on my watch, but it's
[45:35.680 --> 45:39.200]  cover-your-own-ass. Because that's the only way it really makes
[45:39.200 --> 45:44.400]  sense. And it's very disappointing though, because the implications
[45:44.400 --> 45:48.800]  are so severe. I have a feeling, and again, I could be wrong, and
[45:48.800 --> 45:52.240]  that's why it's nervous watching this go down. I have a
[45:52.240 --> 45:57.680]  feeling that Apple might do well in this. I think Apple, I think
[45:57.680 --> 46:00.480]  they should. It's not just because I'm hoping in that. My
[46:00.480 --> 46:03.840]  personal preference is that Apple wins this case. I actually
[46:03.840 --> 46:08.320]  think that on the facts and based on the law, I feel like
[46:08.320 --> 46:09.200]  that they should win.
[46:09.920 --> 46:16.000]  Well, it's so bizarre. It's like, there's so many different
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.120]  bases, and this brief spells out a lot of them, and why what the
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.080]  FBI and Department of Justice are requesting is unprecedented
[46:22.080 --> 46:24.560]  or a misreading. And you know, I've been following this close
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.720]  and never read this brief and some others in depth. This one
[46:26.720 --> 46:29.360]  I read very much in depth because it's, you know, kind of
[46:29.360 --> 46:32.240]  what the crux right now. And because the FBI went into sort
[46:32.240 --> 46:34.720]  of name calling. DOJ isn't saying things that are just kind
[46:34.720 --> 46:36.960]  of, it's like, it feels like watching someone spin out of
[46:36.960 --> 46:39.200]  control. You're like, look, we need an intervention here. And
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.960]  Obama is not your interventionist, apparently. He's
[46:40.960 --> 46:44.480]  like, he's like being your codependent enabler here. But
[46:44.480 --> 46:46.880]  you read this and you're like, look, the All Rights Act has
[46:46.880 --> 46:48.880]  never encompassed this. And there's plenty of evidence like,
[46:48.880 --> 46:51.200]  and what they're studying is speech. It's the CALEA, the
[46:51.200 --> 46:53.440]  legislative history, the previous, whatever. Then you
[46:53.440 --> 46:56.800]  have like basically every person who used to be in
[46:56.800 --> 46:59.360]  intelligence or law enforcement who was at a high level, who is
[46:59.360 --> 47:01.840]  no longer in that office saying, yeah, like, well, what
[47:01.840 --> 47:03.280]  would you have done when you're in office? Well, I might have
[47:03.280 --> 47:06.000]  supported Comey because I had to. Like, well, what about now?
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.080]  Like, no, no, no, no. I mean, the, the interview is with
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.520]  Richard Clark, with Michael Hayden, with, you know, like
[47:11.520 --> 47:14.720]  Clark's NPR interview is astonishing what he said. He's
[47:14.720 --> 47:16.880]  like, it was called the NSA. We could, they could do it,
[47:16.880 --> 47:19.600]  right? Well, that, that's interesting to me. Now, number
[47:19.600 --> 47:23.680]  one, I've found that post 9-11, Richard Clark was one of the
[47:23.680 --> 47:29.520]  most thoughtful and truly impressive individuals, you
[47:29.520 --> 47:34.560]  know, in the US government. I agree. I've been a huge fan of
[47:34.560 --> 47:37.680]  his. I can't even think of a single point that I've ever
[47:37.680 --> 47:40.320]  really disagreed with him on. I get really, and he's, you know,
[47:40.320 --> 47:43.040]  opened my mind to all sorts of things that I had never thought
[47:43.040 --> 47:45.840]  of. Like, he's exactly the sort of person who I would want to
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.080]  be the, you know, who he was and, and who I wish we had more
[47:50.080 --> 47:57.280]  of in national security positions. So when I say, I, my
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.040]  gut feeling would be that if the FBI gave this phone to the
[48:01.040 --> 48:05.280]  NSA, I bet the NSA could, could crack this phone and knows
[48:05.280 --> 48:08.160]  some, you know, knows a way to get in. But that's just based
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.920]  on, you know, me, my hunch as to what I think the NSA can do.
[48:11.920 --> 48:14.960]  Pretty much completely uninformed, but just sort of,
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.320]  you know, it just seems to make sense to me. When Richard Clark
[48:18.320 --> 48:22.160]  says, I'm pretty sure that if you gave this phone to the NSA,
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.160]  they could get in. It's like, go to the cashier and put your
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.080]  money on, on that horse. Oh yeah. Well, yeah. Anything, I
[48:30.080 --> 48:32.240]  think anything that Apple could do to their own operating
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.160]  system, the NSA could do, plus the NSA can disassemble it to
[48:36.160 --> 48:39.600]  like a submolecular level. I mean, they're not magicians,
[48:39.600 --> 48:42.080]  but they're very, you know, they have the best people who
[48:42.080 --> 48:44.880]  are not working in cryptography in public and private
[48:44.880 --> 48:46.880]  enterprise. I mean, you should say private enterprise rather,
[48:46.880 --> 48:50.160]  and in public sector open jobs. They're working at the NSA. I
[48:50.160 --> 48:54.000]  mean, this is the thing, like you, I don't love how our
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.280]  government is using the NSA and the FBI to gather information.
[48:57.280 --> 49:00.960]  I do respect that the people at the FBI, CIA, and NSA are some,
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.240]  there's some people in there, maybe many people based on some
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.320]  things we hear, who are some of the smartest people on the
[49:06.320 --> 49:08.880]  planet. And they're going there because they're told, look, do
[49:08.880 --> 49:11.520]  you want to work with the most interesting thing you can never
[49:11.520 --> 49:14.400]  talk about it, maybe like for decades or ever, but you're
[49:14.400 --> 49:16.640]  going to work with the most interesting, cutting edge
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.360]  technology, ideas, and hardware and theory that no one else in
[49:21.360 --> 49:23.600]  the world can work with. You're going to go there. There are
[49:23.600 --> 49:25.840]  people who go there and they may have moral qualms about it or
[49:25.840 --> 49:28.080]  not, or that doesn't enter into it, or they support the
[49:28.080 --> 49:31.120]  missions, but it is a, it's kind of an interesting pull,
[49:31.120 --> 49:36.960]  right? So I'm sure that, so I want to talk about employment
[49:36.960 --> 49:39.680]  issues just for a second too, because this comes back to this
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.960]  Apple brief. So let's say Apple loses and is compelled.
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.480]  All right, hold that thought. Hold that thought. I know where
[49:46.480 --> 49:48.880]  you're going and it's too long of a segment. I want to do it.
[49:48.880 --> 49:50.800]  I'm going to hold my breath. You go ahead.
[49:50.800 --> 49:52.960]  Let me just say this before I do the sponsor. I just want to
[49:52.960 --> 49:55.840]  go back. This is, these are two quotes that Apple pulled out.
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.400]  You referenced them both, but this is people who've come out
[50:00.400 --> 50:03.840]  and it's almost to a surprising degree and I'm impressed at
[50:03.840 --> 50:06.320]  some of the people who've come out in favor of encryption on
[50:06.320 --> 50:12.080]  this. But one of them is former NSA and CIA director Michael
[50:12.080 --> 50:15.600]  Hayden. That's who Michael Hayden is. His quote is Apple,
[50:15.600 --> 50:19.040]  or America, I'm sorry, America is more secure. America is more
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.000]  safe with unbreakable end-to-end encryption. That's, that's, I
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.640]  mean, you can't get more clear than that. And here's defense
[50:26.640 --> 50:30.640]  secretary Ashton Carter. So that's crossing the line over
[50:30.640 --> 50:33.760]  to the Department of Defense. Data security, including
[50:33.760 --> 50:36.880]  encryption is absolutely essential to us. I'm not a
[50:36.880 --> 50:40.880]  believer in back doors. And that, and to me, the angle there
[50:40.880 --> 50:47.120]  is that it gets to that, uh, that, um, the Rich Mogul thing
[50:47.120 --> 50:50.640]  where, where, why is the Department of Justice doing
[50:50.640 --> 50:54.160]  this? And it's, it doesn't make any sense from a national
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.480]  security perspective. And that, I mean, that point blank is
[50:56.480 --> 50:59.120]  what the, these other guys are saying is that from a national
[50:59.120 --> 51:05.920]  security perspective, uh, back doors are disaster. And so, and
[51:05.920 --> 51:08.560]  Apple in their brief is saying that the government is saying
[51:08.560 --> 51:10.880]  you can't take that into consideration and Apple in their
[51:10.880 --> 51:12.800]  brief is saying, I don't know about the legality of the
[51:12.800 --> 51:14.560]  argument of whether the court should take it into
[51:14.560 --> 51:17.440]  consideration, but Apple is certainly emphasizing that
[51:17.440 --> 51:20.800]  angle. All right, let's take a break and we'll talk about that
[51:20.800 --> 51:26.880]  employment issue. Okay. Uh, I am going to tell you about our
[51:26.880 --> 51:31.120]  good friends at igloo. You guys know igloo. We all struggle
[51:31.120 --> 51:34.800]  with productivity. We're constantly under pressure to
[51:34.800 --> 51:38.880]  accomplish more, uh, do it faster. And there's no one
[51:38.880 --> 51:41.120]  definitive way to accomplish that when you're on a small
[51:41.120 --> 51:44.640]  team or a small company or, or, or something like that. So we
[51:44.640 --> 51:47.600]  all have our own methods to make things work and we combine,
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.080]  you know, this sort of chat with this file sharing and other
[51:52.080 --> 51:57.280]  technologies igloo can help you and your team keep doing things
[51:57.280 --> 52:00.960]  your way. Only better collaboration should not be
[52:00.960 --> 52:04.880]  painful. What igloo is pure and simple is an intranet that
[52:04.880 --> 52:10.560]  you'll actually like. They have all sorts of ways to, um,
[52:10.560 --> 52:13.600]  customize it and get just the features that you and your team
[52:13.600 --> 52:16.320]  need to fill in the gaps in the system you already use. But
[52:16.320 --> 52:18.720]  that's not like when you sign up for igloo, you have to
[52:18.720 --> 52:21.760]  suddenly drop everything you're already using and do things.
[52:21.760 --> 52:24.560]  The quote igloo way. It's not like that at all igloo. It's
[52:24.560 --> 52:29.440]  just a toolkit to let you and your team keep working the way
[52:29.440 --> 52:34.880]  that you already do just better. Uh, you can sign up free
[52:34.880 --> 52:40.560]  of charge, no credit card required at igloo software.com
[52:40.560 --> 52:45.280]  slash T T S. So just go there. If you have a team and you're
[52:45.280 --> 52:47.680]  struggling in any way to collaborate, just go to igloo
[52:47.680 --> 52:52.240]  software.com slash TTS, sign up for free, check it out and see
[52:52.240 --> 52:56.880]  how good it could be. Um, so my thanks to igloo. All right,
[52:56.880 --> 52:59.600]  let's talk about the employment issue now. Yeah. So we were
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.440]  talking about this on Twitter because I had this horrible.
[53:01.440 --> 53:03.760]  Okay. So this gets into like, I feel like we're in Orwell
[53:03.760 --> 53:07.360]  territory at all levels. Like, okay. Uh, snow crash. Did you
[53:07.360 --> 53:10.720]  ever read Neil Stevenson's snow crash? Um, I'm embarrassed to
[53:10.720 --> 53:13.760]  say no. As a programmer, you would love it. And it's sort of
[53:13.760 --> 53:16.480]  about hacking the brain, but one of the themes in it without
[53:16.480 --> 53:19.280]  giving spoilers to like a 20 year old book is this notion
[53:19.280 --> 53:22.800]  that a company wanted to retain the ownership of programming
[53:22.800 --> 53:26.240]  code in their programmers minds. So when they left, they
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.360]  couldn't use it elsewhere. I mean, that's, I'm paraphrasing.
[53:29.360 --> 53:32.720]  I had this thought I'm reading this. So Apple loses this case.
[53:32.720 --> 53:35.280]  The court says it compels them to write what they're calling,
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.680]  you know, gov D G O G government G O V T O S. I'm picturing
[53:39.680 --> 53:44.160]  this meeting, Tim Cook in a room with like 200 people. And
[53:44.160 --> 53:46.880]  it's everybody at Apple capable of working on this. And I says,
[53:46.880 --> 53:49.760]  all right, you know, what's happened. Uh, the order has been
[53:49.760 --> 53:52.320]  given. We are going to, we always, uh, you know, we're
[53:52.320 --> 53:54.560]  going to try to appeal it, but right now we haven't been able
[53:54.560 --> 53:58.640]  to stay. Um, we need you to do this. Um, and we can't order
[53:58.640 --> 54:01.040]  anyone to do it. We can, we've been ordered, uh, but you were
[54:01.040 --> 54:03.520]  all individuals and this needs to happen. Like what, what are
[54:03.520 --> 54:06.080]  those people do? What are those people do? And what does the
[54:06.080 --> 54:11.600]  court do if all 200 of them suddenly quit and what does Tim
[54:11.600 --> 54:14.480]  do for those people if they suddenly quit? I mean, I just
[54:14.480 --> 54:17.360]  think you can't, you can order Apple to do something, but
[54:17.360 --> 54:20.960]  employees are at will. None of the executives can do this.
[54:20.960 --> 54:24.640]  They need specific employees and the engineering level. What
[54:24.640 --> 54:31.760]  happens? I also wonder just how many engineers at Apple would
[54:31.760 --> 54:36.400]  be capable of doing this now capable. You can obviously hire
[54:36.400 --> 54:39.840]  somebody new and provide them with the source code and let
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.600]  them study it and study the way the entire system works long
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.400]  enough. And somebody who's obviously not even employed by
[54:46.400 --> 54:49.920]  Apple today could eventually become capable of doing it. So
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.560]  it's, you know, I'm not saying it's impossible, but I wonder
[54:54.560 --> 54:58.240]  how many people within Apple would be on the team that would
[54:58.240 --> 55:04.000]  be commissioned to undertake this. I don't know that it's 200.
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.640]  I think it's probably a significantly lower number of
[55:06.640 --> 55:10.960]  people who work in the area of system level device security.
[55:11.520 --> 55:13.760]  So is it Daniel Jalkut who used to work at Apple? I mean,
[55:13.760 --> 55:15.920]  years ago working at Apple. I think, did he say something in
[55:15.920 --> 55:18.080]  response to this? Was it like he said there might be 100
[55:18.080 --> 55:20.480]  people in the world? Maybe I'm exaggerating the number.
[55:20.480 --> 55:20.800]  Something like that.
[55:20.800 --> 55:23.840]  That's too small, but it was, it's right. It's not that other
[55:23.840 --> 55:28.000]  people could, it's not that other people can't get up to
[55:28.000 --> 55:31.520]  speed, but in order to, then they'd have to hire other
[55:31.520 --> 55:33.760]  people. And it's not even an issue of morals. Like I have to
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.360]  wonder, what is your career like inside Apple? If you're the
[55:37.360 --> 55:40.240]  gal or guy who says, yeah, sure, whatever the government
[55:40.240 --> 55:44.160]  wants, like you do the government OS and it's delivered
[55:44.160 --> 55:47.680]  and it's Tim say, thanks for helping us obey the court order
[55:47.680 --> 55:49.920]  and you have no future with us. Could you be fired for
[55:50.480 --> 55:53.600]  being a good employee? Could you be put on in Siberia and
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.600]  sent to an Alaskan outpost of Apple to work on projects
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.240]  there? I don't know.
[55:58.240 --> 56:05.440]  No, it's, it's easy to, uh, outside, you know, to just,
[56:05.440 --> 56:08.080]  uh, abstract at somebody with an Apple could do it. Apple
[56:08.080 --> 56:09.840]  has got a lot of money in the last smart people. They can
[56:09.840 --> 56:12.880]  do it, but at some level it comes, it will, if it ever, if
[56:12.880 --> 56:16.800]  this came to pass, it would come down to individuals. And
[56:16.800 --> 56:18.720]  I think they'd have to make a decision. And, and for
[56:18.720 --> 56:21.280]  security purposes, it would be better to have it be as
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.040]  few people as possible. Um, I've often thought about this.
[56:25.040 --> 56:28.640]  I wonder what Apple's security policies are for hiring
[56:28.640 --> 56:32.960]  people to work on stuff like this. Like how do think about
[56:32.960 --> 56:36.640]  it? I mean, how did they make sure that a, a secret agent
[56:36.640 --> 56:42.640]  for, uh, you know, China isn't, isn't applying to be an
[56:42.640 --> 56:46.480]  engineer on iOS who would place a backdoor. I mean, it's,
[56:46.480 --> 56:48.800]  and it sounds like it start thinking, it sounds like
[56:48.800 --> 56:50.640]  something out of a, you know, a James Bond movie or
[56:50.640 --> 56:52.560]  something like that, but stuff like that has happened,
[56:52.560 --> 56:57.280]  right? There've been backdoors placed in, um, remember the
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.240]  open SSL one. Um, Oh yeah. The heart bleed, uh, well, heart
[57:02.240 --> 57:05.200]  bleed was that the, and I, you know, I don't even want to
[57:05.200 --> 57:07.680]  just blame China. I think that there's a strong suspicion
[57:07.680 --> 57:11.840]  that it was the U S government who, who, uh, surreptitiously
[57:11.840 --> 57:15.360]  placed a backdoor and, and like an SSL library that was,
[57:15.360 --> 57:17.040]  Oh yeah. There's, yeah. And there's some purposely, what
[57:17.040 --> 57:21.040]  seems to be purposely weakened encryption that, uh, NIST, uh,
[57:21.040 --> 57:24.640]  seemed to have some interaction with and, uh, it's a VPN,
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.320]  uh, software libraries. Um, no, it's not implausible. I
[57:28.320 --> 57:30.160]  mean, this is the thing, like what really drives the world
[57:30.160 --> 57:33.120]  is not spy craft in the terms of, uh, state run espionage.
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.560]  It's, um, industrial espionage is a huge thing. It's huge.
[57:36.560 --> 57:39.680]  It happens continuously. Uh, this is not like a movie
[57:39.680 --> 57:42.640]  thing. It's, there are people working inside companies
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.960]  constantly selling secrets to competitors. And what do
[57:44.960 --> 57:49.600]  you, what do you do when somebody, uh, a very talented
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.960]  programmer with a security background who without lying
[57:54.960 --> 57:57.840]  about their employing history at all, but has spent, you
[57:57.840 --> 58:01.120]  know, like eight years working for the NSA applies to work on
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.320]  a security job. You laugh, but if they're being, if they're
[58:06.320 --> 58:09.840]  being honest, it could be a tremendous hire. And did I tell
[58:09.840 --> 58:12.160]  you this story already? I once met guys from the CIA print
[58:12.160 --> 58:14.800]  shop and they said, we gave them business cards and they
[58:14.800 --> 58:16.720]  said, we have business cards. We can't give them to you. And
[58:16.720 --> 58:18.880]  we said, you're serious. They said, yeah, we can only hand
[58:18.880 --> 58:20.640]  them out inside the building. So I'm like, how do you get a
[58:20.640 --> 58:22.960]  reference from the NSA for your job at Apple too?
[58:24.560 --> 58:28.960]  I don't know, but you know, but what, you know, it, I, it
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.280]  must occur to them, you know, and it's, uh, anyway, it's,
[58:33.280 --> 58:34.880]  we're getting off the point though, of what happens if
[58:34.880 --> 58:37.840]  everybody who works at Apple refuses to do this and, and I,
[58:38.480 --> 58:41.440]  or even a majority, like you need, I mean, I said 200,
[58:41.440 --> 58:43.520]  partly because it's like project managers and what like,
[58:43.520 --> 58:46.000]  there's people who have the expertise and then there's the
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.040]  people who support those people and people, I mean, who
[58:49.040 --> 58:52.400]  has the key, who has the codes that give them access to like
[58:52.400 --> 58:56.320]  the root certificates that are used, all this stuff involves a
[58:56.320 --> 58:59.920]  very small number of people. Uh, but what if they all, I
[58:59.920 --> 59:01.600]  mean, look, if you and I were in that position, I think we
[59:01.600 --> 59:04.240]  know what we do. We quit, right. We quit. And then can
[59:04.240 --> 59:06.560]  the government compel us? Could the government court say,
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.400]  you're not allowed to quit. I can't imagine, but could they,
[59:10.400 --> 59:14.080]  I don't know the legality. And it's even easier in today's,
[59:14.080 --> 59:18.880]  the current job market in, in Silicon Valley. No, it is.
[59:18.880 --> 59:22.000]  I'm being, I just want to be out there and say that I'm not
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.520]  even trying to say that it's an act of nobility. It would be,
[59:25.520 --> 59:28.160]  I would like to think. And, and, and I would like to think
[59:28.160 --> 59:31.360]  that I would act on principle, but if you just want to get
[59:31.360 --> 59:35.120]  down to the cold, hard facts of, well, you know, you've got
[59:35.120 --> 59:37.280]  a mortgage to pay and kids to put through college or
[59:37.280 --> 59:39.760]  whatever. It's like somebody who has extensive experience
[59:39.760 --> 59:42.800]  on Apple's security team is not going to have a hard time
[59:42.800 --> 59:45.440]  getting another job. No, absolutely not. Right. They
[59:45.440 --> 59:47.280]  probably get like million dollar bonuses that are still
[59:47.280 --> 59:49.360]  being handled, handed out when they go to work for one of
[59:49.360 --> 59:51.120]  the unicorns. Right. And it might break their heart because
[59:51.120 --> 59:53.600]  maybe they'd prefer to work at Apple, but you know, rather
[59:53.600 --> 59:57.360]  do good work for Google than do destructive work for Apple.
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.480]  I mean, it's, it's, it, to me is not an outlandish scenario
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.920]  at all. And I do think, I do think, I think that people who
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.880]  work in encryption, it's like you said, that it spans the
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.960]  political gamut. That's one of the things that I really like
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.200]  about this is that in, in what I, you know, in my sideline as
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.880]  an amateur Twitter political columnist, one of the things
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.920]  that depresses me about the current state of decades long
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.280]  discourse in the United States is the polarization of, of
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.280]  politics and that so many issues are so clearly polarized
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.040]  and that we've, we've self sorted on these various lines
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.960]  into the two parties and that there's no interchange between
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.560]  them. I, I, I, it does my heart, it warms my heart that on
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.920]  this particular issue, it, it, it doesn't fall on, on one line
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.760]  or the other. And if anything, because the DOJ is part of the
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.720]  executive branch, you'd have, I would have to say that the,
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.200]  you know, the Democrats have more responsibility in this
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.320]  case with Apple than the Republicans. I mean, there
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.120]  certainly are Republicans who I've seen call for Apple should
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.160]  just open the iPhone. Oh yeah. But do you, I'm sure you watch
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.080]  the John Oliver. Yes. Which is brilliant. The Lindsey Graham
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080]  thing. I didn't realize Lindsey Graham had recanted his
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.040]  position to watch Lindsey Graham say, Oh, I was wrong. I've
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.000]  been better informed now. You're like coming to Jesus
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.080]  moment. If he can be convinced, then wow. I mean, I know he's
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.640]  got the easy side also of, you know, they want to support law
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.200]  and order, which is a fundamental GOP stance, but he
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.440]  also can be opposed in the Obama administration by doing
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.600]  so. Even with that, I, I was just like, Oh my God. Well,
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.440]  they, they got to him, they explained it to him and he
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.120]  accepted the logic of what was explained. Right. I think
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.320]  Darrell Issa, who I generally disagree with. Oh God, I was
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.760]  just, I retweeted him today because he's, he's so right in
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.560]  some places. And he's, he, he understands it to a certain
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.880]  degree. I mean, and I know he had a background in technology
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.840]  before you got into politics, but at least at the layman's
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.600]  understanding that you would hope that our legislators would
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:07.840]  have, he's got it. He's been really good. Here's an
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.280]  interesting, just a side note, get back to 1776 because this
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.960]  is a musical podcast. I know there's a bit. So imagine
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.280]  you're the engineer at Apple or a set of engineers and you're
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:20.480]  the people who write the code that's been compelled by the
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.440]  government to essentially betray humanity. I mean, it
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.560]  comes down, let's, I'm not even exaggerating the case. In
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.760]  1776, the musical, it draws on, there are no apparent records
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.440]  that just that are came from the Continental Congress because
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.360]  they were worried about being intercepted, all kinds of
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.560]  stuff. So there's, 1776 is a recreation from later
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.920]  remembrances of people and other sources. There's a judge,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.800]  Judge Wilson is from the Pennsylvania delegation. So
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.800]  it's, you've got Dickinson on one side is opposed to voting
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.960]  for independence. You have Franklin on the other who is
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.920]  for it. This is a key vote. Wilson, who had supported
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.240]  Dickinson sort of out of moderation, changes essentially
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.040]  last minute, declares himself and it's a dramatic moment in
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.080]  the musical, but it's also essentially what happened in
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.720]  reality. Here's the thing, he didn't want to be, this is the
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:07.040]  motivation given to him. He didn't want to be the person
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.560]  who killed Liberty. He wanted to be kind of, you know, under
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.440]  the radar and it's like everyone will remember Judge
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.320]  Wilson as the person who killed American Liberty, you know? And
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.320]  you think about that as the programmers, you've like maybe
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.200]  20 people or 15 people on a team that do it and you're the
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.880]  people who killed encryption for everybody. How do you do
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.840]  that? That's a traumatic thing you'd be put through if you
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.080]  have that kind of conscience, right? There's a personal
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.160]  security angle here and Apple has mentioned this in there. I
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.880]  think in a brief, but if not in a brief, certainly in the one
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.440]  of the supplements, you know, there's the testimony from
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.840]  Craig Federighi and yeah, I forget the guy's name that it's
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:54.880]  got a big long name that starts with an N. Sorry if you
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.520]  listen to the talk show. It's Eric Neuenschwander, how
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.480]  would you pronounce it? I'm pronouncing it Germanly.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.480]  It's a big long Germanic name and but part of it is that
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.040]  there's a personal security angle to this where right now
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.840]  nobody knows how to create, as Apple calls it, government OS,
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.960]  a version of OS that you can install on top of an existing
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.040]  iPhone without destroying its encryption keys and then
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:29.280]  bypass the protections against the touchpad, which once you
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.840]  get rid of those protections, it's easy. I mean, and
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.360]  obviously using a long alphanumeric password or
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.440]  passphrase, I guess I should say, would actually, you know,
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.760]  would significantly help increase the security of your
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:48.240]  phone, but even the six-digit passcode, it would take longer
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.840]  to brute force, but once you bypass the protections, you
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:56.080]  know, you're talking about like days or weeks, not, you know,
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:03.280]  years. There are jailbreaks for the phone, zero-day, you know,
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.640]  what are they, zero-day exploits that have been sold on
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.280]  the open market, and there was one that sold for like over a
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.920]  million dollars last year, like a way to, you know, like a
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.720]  security form put out like a bounty and said, if you can get
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.600]  us into, you know, a jailbreaker on an iPhone that
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.400]  under the following conditions, like let's say like just by
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:33.040]  sending a text message or just by opening this URL in Safari
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.560]  sold for like a million dollars. Can you imagine what
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.960]  the black market value of Government OS would be? It's
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.680]  again, it's not, it sounds like we're talking about cloak and
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:47.280]  dagger, you know, James Bond, Jason Bourne movie stuff, but
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.000]  it's not, it's real, right? It, but imagine if the identities
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.200]  of the engineers at Apple who knew how to make it and knew
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:01.520]  how to, you know, knew the details of it, it would put
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.920]  them in some measure of personal risk. I mean, I think
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.240]  right now they must be too. Imagine if you have some of the
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.360]  secrets. I'm sure there's people already, Apple security
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:15.520]  must already have eyes on them both from the perspective and
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.160]  the danger side. Like are these people going off to do stuff?
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.560]  They're probably being watched, but also is someone trying to
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.640]  kidnap? I mean, imagine if your family is kidnapped and you
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.960]  know how to do whatever and it's kind of quiet and you're
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.200]  like, yeah, here's the key. I mean, and that's just now
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:32.640]  before Government OS is built. Right. Apple has made the
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.360]  analogy and I think this, you know, this comes to, you know,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:41.600]  the way that the Bill of Rights to me, you know, protects acts
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.480]  of your conscience. You know, I mean, that's a big part of what
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:53.600]  the First Amendment is about. Apple has made the analogy to
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.080]  like a, what could a pharmaceutical company be
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.720]  forced to produce the serum for a lethal injection, which is a
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.600]  real world political problem right now. That is not
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:08.320]  hypothetical either. Right. Where the states in the United
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.920]  States that still have the death penalty because it's been
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:17.520]  banned in the rest of the civilized world and there's
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.080]  only, you know, it's really only practiced in the first
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.160]  world in the United States and only then in certain states, the
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.960]  company, you know, whatever they used to use to give people a
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.760]  lethal injection. There's no more of the serum. If you want
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.880]  to be really sorry. No, you want to be really interesting
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.680]  coverage about that. Buzzfeed has had some really amazing
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.200]  coverage about this, the people selling drugs from India and so
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.320]  forth. Fascinating. And the states refusing to disclose
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.080]  information that they should be about where they're obtaining
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.680]  the drugs from. Right. Alright. I will look that up. Buzzfeed
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.560]  on lethal injections. Right. Because can you, can a state,
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:55.840]  you know, this is getting off into the weeds on the death
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.960]  penalty, but can a state use a substance to put a prisoner to
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.840]  death that isn't like FDA approved and why in the world,
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.840]  you know, it gets down to the question of why in the world
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.360]  would the FDA approve a substance that, you know, that
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.960]  kills people. But well, so could the, but Apple's question
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:17.200]  stands. Could the All Ritz Act be used for if the, could the
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.360]  government say, okay, we don't have any more of this stuff.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.400]  Let's go to, let's go to Pfizer and compel Pfizer to come up
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:29.200]  with a serum that would have the following qualities, you
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.080]  know, that it's, you know, painless and puts you to death.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.160]  Yeah. This is a, I think one of the great arguments, and I
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.160]  think it's very directly related to what you're talking
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.080]  about here is Apple trying to show what I think is they'd
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.840]  like to say is settled law, that code is speech. And other
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.320]  people may be less secure in that. I think it's pretty
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.280]  settled. I think the Supreme Court has really made that
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:54.640]  clear. And the FBI and DOJ would like to say that code is
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.040]  not speech when it's functional code. There's a thing where
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.760]  Apple is sort of ridiculing the FBI's phrase in the brief.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.000]  There's no such thing as functional code. All code is the
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.560]  same thing. So you cannot, it's unconstitutional to compel
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.960]  speech. That is practically, I'm pretty sure that is an
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.040]  overriding principle. I'm not a constitutional lawyer. I'm
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.520]  not sure, but I'm pretty sure I keep reading what you cannot
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.240]  compel speech. No court can compel speech. It can compel
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.440]  you to testify, or it can penalize you for not testifying,
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.480]  for not providing information, but you cannot compel someone
[01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:28.160]  to speech. And you cannot compel a programmer to program.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.720]  Few of wise Twitter, Twitterers were saying, wait a
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.280]  minute, if corporations are people, can you compel
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.760]  corporations to speech given that they are now, you know,
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:39.200]  under Citizens United and other rulings should have
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.840]  ostensibly the same rights. So can you compel Apple to
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.640]  speech if that involves code? I mean, that's the thing about
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.280]  this brief is Apple is hacking away at many, many, many
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.880]  different, you know, trees with poisoned fruit. And I think
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.200]  the code is speech when it's very compelling, even if the
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:56.160]  all-rits one, which is also compelling, falls down.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.160]  Yes, I agree on both of those parts, that to me, that's the
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:05.280]  main thrust of Apple's two-fold argument is that they can't be
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.840]  compelled to do this because it's speech, and it's deeply
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.040]  offensive to Apple and the employees who would be, you
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.520]  know, subject to carry it out, and that the all-rits act
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.520]  cannot be used to compel extraordinary action. And to me,
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.600]  that's when you read the government thing, and I almost
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.880]  feel bad for the lawyers who wrote the government's brief
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.520]  because I don't think it was their decision to. It's not
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.840]  like James Comey had to write the brief. It's not like
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:33.840]  Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General, wrote the brief. It's
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.240]  like it got assigned to these, you know, the two lawyers who
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.200]  wrote it. And I almost feel bad for them because I feel like
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.040]  it's like when you're, you know, that's what it's like to
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.840]  be a lawyer. You don't get to pick the side, you know what I
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.560]  mean? Like, they might well know that their argument
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.200]  stands on nothing but thin air, but they've still got to write
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.240]  the brief. They're left arguing that the government is left
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.200]  trying to argue because they know that the all-rits act is
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.080]  supposed to fill in the gaps of statutory law. So they're left
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.360]  trying to argue that the use of the all-rits act here isn't
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.480]  compelling Apple to do something extraordinary. But
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.880]  it's really, really hard to do that, you know? And the gist of
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.360]  it is that the all-rits, you know, for people who aren't, you
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.920]  know, aren't paying attention that the all-rits act is
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.720]  supposed to fill in the gaps that isn't covered by existing
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:27.840]  law. So if there's a law that says this and a law that says
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.200]  that, but there's a minor issue that's in between there, the
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.160]  all-rits act fills it in. And I think one of the examples the
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.880]  government gave is that somebody can be compelled to give
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:43.520]  testimony in court, like you said. What if their testimony
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.920]  will take three days? Where do they go? Right? And so maybe
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.320]  there's no law that says that the all-rits act would fill it
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.560]  in and that the government can just do what's reasonable and
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.880]  put the guy up in a hotel. You know, the government will put
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.600]  you up in a hotel for three days. So you still have to
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:00.640]  testify for the full three days. But even if there's no law that
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.920]  says that when a, you know, that says when a witness has to
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.080]  testify for more than one day, the government will put them up
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.360]  in a hotel. It's just that the all-rits act can fill in and
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:14.320]  fill in the gap in a situation like that. Apple's argument, and
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.560]  I think it's extremely compelling, is that if the
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.880]  government wants to compel a company to do what they're
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.520]  saying they want Apple to do, it has to be passed through
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.200]  legislation. You have to pass a law that says yes, in this case
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.040]  you would have to do this. Because otherwise you're at,
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.440]  you know, because it's an extraordinary thing. And the
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:36.560]  other analogies I thought about, and I want to see what you think
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.120]  about this, but so for example, famously, I think it's the 60s,
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.520]  I might be getting the time wrong, but when Ralph Nader
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.600]  wrote the, what was the book, Unsafe at Any Speed, about the
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:59.200]  horrible state of car crash safety, you know, and
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.200]  wanted to legislate that, you know, to get car companies to
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.040]  mandate that they put seatbelts in cars. And the car industry
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.720]  pushed back against mandatory seatbelts under the argument
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.520]  that putting seatbelts in cars made cars look unsafe. That if
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.640]  you got, now this is true, I'm not making this up, right? So
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.880]  they said, no, we don't, you know, this is not a good idea
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.240]  because, you know, people love driving cars and they feel safe
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.720]  and happy driving cars, but if you go in there and there's
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.600]  these safety harnesses, you know, safety belts, it's going
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.160]  to make people think that they're dangerous. That's not,
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.200]  it sounds silly in hindsight, and we now have a lot of
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.480]  statistics that back up that it's, you know, obviously hasn't
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.040]  stopped Americans from driving, and we have statistics that
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.360]  prove that, you know, the safety advances that have been
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.800]  mandated have been tremendous boons to public safety. But
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:57.600]  it's not a ridiculous argument. It's not ridiculous that the
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.240]  logic of the car manufacturers, it was provably wrong, but that
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.000]  didn't, it didn't happen through the All-Rits Act. It happened
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.560]  through, you know, real legislation passed through
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.120]  Congress that mandated things like this, and that's the way it
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:15.760]  should be. And the other analogy I can think of, this isn't
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.280]  national, it's all gone local, like state by state and city by
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:24.560]  city, but one of the great things of my lifetime as someone
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.760]  who really, really has always been bothered by cigarette
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.120]  smoke is the passing of laws that get cigarettes out of bars
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.400]  and restaurants and workplaces and stuff like that. Now, it was
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.960]  a common, common, and oft repeated refrain, especially
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.240]  from bar owners, that if you made smoking illegal in bars, it
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.000]  would dry, business would dry up because people who smoked
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.320]  would go to private establishments instead of
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.040]  public ones, because they're not going to stop smoking while
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.320]  they drink. And the common sense that says that that argument
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.440]  might hold water, right? It might, there's, there's some
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:07.200]  logic to that. And again, that this wasn't done through the
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.440]  All-Rits Act. It was, you have to pass an actual law and fight
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.880]  and make that argument and listen to the people, the bar
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.840]  owners arguing. And now, I picked both of those examples,
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.960]  the seatbelt, the mandatory seatbelts, and the getting
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.320]  cigarettes out of bars and restaurants. I picked those
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.680]  specifically because I know that those arguments are on the
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:32.480]  wrong side, right? That it's, in my opinion, it's correct that
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.320]  seatbelts and, and, you know, other safety devices and, you
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.320]  know, very high standards for, you know, crash survivability
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.280]  are a good idea. And that I think it's a very good idea for
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.280]  public health, that cigarettes are not, are banned in most
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.040]  restaurants and bars now. But I still think that it was right
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.200]  that they had to pass legislation to do it. So in this
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.240]  case, to me, with Apple being on the right side, it's even more
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.360]  important that if you want to force them to do this terrible
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.440]  thing, that you have to fight it out in the legislature.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.040]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think those are great
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:11.680]  examples. And we could also get to like, gun control, as part of
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.280]  this issue, too, is like, what can be done under regulations,
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.720]  existing regulations and enforce and what requires laws to be
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:22.000]  passed and whatever side you are about the, you know, how many
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.760]  guns should be out there, guns should be out there at all in
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.520]  private hands, whatever the side you are, I think I would argue,
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.400]  I would rather have a legislative solution than a
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.880]  regulatory one, even if regulatory one might be better,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.760]  whether that's for allowing broader gun ownership or
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.400]  narrower gun ownership, because without the legislative
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.600]  solution, an executive making a decision, it doesn't lack that
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.400]  consensus. So we have the same situation here. It's like, do
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.960]  you want the government to use a 240 something year old law
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:55.200]  with a strained logic to upset the future of privacy and
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.880]  communication protection when the CALEA more recently
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:02.000]  addressed it, or didn't address it in specific ways? Or do you
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.880]  want legislators, you know, regardless again, of who, which
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.960]  political party is in charge? It's not actually a political
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.160]  issue in that sense. It's a political issue of how this
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.640]  would be addressed in a comprehensive way through a
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.680]  process that has various, you know, three branches of
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.480]  government and the checks and balances. I don't really want
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.280]  an executive agency to push through something like this.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.840]  And, you know, despite having, I'll admit it, I voted for
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.520]  Obama, yes, twice. And, but I don't really like the extensive
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.000]  use of presidential orders, executive orders, and
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.480]  regulatory moves that he's using. I understand why he's
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.200]  doing it. I don't think there is long lasting. And I don't
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.120]  think there, I mean, I know we're in the middle of
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.920]  intransigence and you, with gridlock, you have to try
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.840]  things and so forth. So I understand whether they're
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.400]  being done, but they won't have the lasting effect. They
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.640]  won't, they don't indicate a change of policy where
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.200]  something like the Affordable Care Act, they were able to
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.480]  actually get that passed. It became law and you see how
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.920]  implacable it is to resistance. I mean, look at, you know,
[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:59.680]  the Supreme Court Chief Justice voting in favor,
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.400]  surprising everyone in favor of ACA under the Commerce
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.960]  Clause and, you know, all these decisions that have come
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.640]  through where the ACI, ACA has had some, you know, fall
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:13.760]  back, but mostly been upheld because it was law as opposed
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.880]  to regulatory interpretation or strained regulatory
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.200]  interpretation or presidential order. So, and a lot of
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.520]  presidential orders recently have been thrown down by the
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.720]  courts at various levels and some have not been upheld so
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.240]  far. You went to guns. So I'll, I'll go to, I know guns
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.120]  like, yeah, we should, but I thought you did. I, hopefully
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.520]  I think we've done so in a way that is amenable to
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.360]  anybody on either side of the issue. I'm going to go to
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.280]  abortion and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ruth Bader. That's
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.520]  the game we're playing, guns, abortion, and all rights act.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.440]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg has argued, and I think surprising
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.920]  many people long argued, I think from before she was on
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.480]  the Supreme Court, I think it was a paper she wrote that
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:56.560]  kind of got her to the Supreme Court ruling that, that
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:01.280]  Roe v. Wade was actually a setback in the long run for
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.800]  abortion rights because it was a sweeping change by the
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.560]  Supreme Court. And rather than letting it work its way
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.840]  through the legislative branch, which would have given
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:19.040]  it a lot more, that things work out better and are more
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:22.240]  broadly accepted when they go through the legislature
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.720]  than when the judiciary passes, takes, takes matters
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.080]  into its own hands. And again, I don't even want to just
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.320]  don't even want to touch on this side of which way it
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.800]  should go. You know, pretty clear my views on it are
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.280]  known, but it doesn't matter though. I think that the
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.480]  basic argument though, that Roe v. Wade has remained
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.600]  controversial in a way that a legislative solution, which
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.040]  the US was probably heading to at the time in the 70s,
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.480]  would have had more staying power. It's almost
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.760]  remarkable to the extent that Roe v. Wade has remained
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:03.440]  so radioactively controversial, 40-some years later,
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.360]  44 years later, that a 44-year-old Supreme Court
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:11.920]  decision is still considered contentious is, you know,
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:16.960]  shows the logic of Ginsburg's argument.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.000]  I have to agree with that too. It does not matter what
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.880]  your stance is on abortion, a legislative decision that
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:26.240]  was made and carried out at a national level and then
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.280]  enforced and refined by Supreme Court rulings that
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.960]  narrowed or broadened them on more limited grounds,
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.360]  people would be arguing about it in a different way
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.560]  because they would have felt like the, you know, they
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.800]  would be looking to overturn the law as opposed to
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.880]  trying to figure out how to change a constitutional
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.040]  precedent and maybe ultimately it would have become
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.800]  enshrined as a constitutional precedent. You would
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.240]  have had, you know, a Roe law and the law having passed,
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.560]  I think in the 70s, I think the GOP and the Democratic
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.960]  Party at the time, I think would easily have passed a
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.960]  law that I think, I actually think it would have not
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.840]  been that difficult to produce consensus then. So,
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:08.240]  let's say that happened. So, you had a Roe law and then
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.240]  some Roe-based decisions later that refined it. You
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.520]  know, people would still be debating about it, would
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.280]  still be active, but there wouldn't be this notion
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.400]  that it could be just a small tweak in the composition
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.800]  of the court would change this for everyone because
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.800]  you would have to get the law returned or you'd have
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.560]  to have a radically different Supreme Court
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.720]  interpretation. And that's an ongoing issue in the
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.800]  court and it's one of the critiques of Scalia as an
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.720]  originalist is that he was, as an originalist, he
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.280]  didn't care about precedent as much as proceeding
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.680]  courts did. And you can see the liberal and some
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.800]  conservative justices going off on rejecting on the
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.560]  fact that decisions overturned sometimes relatively
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.240]  recent precedents, which is not historically the case.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.160]  It's usually long periods of time before precedents
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.480]  are overturned by one, from one court to another.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.840]  So, yeah, I think you're, I mean, so in this case,
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.960]  let's say it's, I think Congress addressing it and
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.960]  interestingly, given Congress's approach to this, I
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.480]  wouldn't be surprised if Congress could reach
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.520]  consensus, maybe not in this one, but the next one,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.640]  about the direction it should take that would not be
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.640]  as extreme as the administration's position and
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.880]  would not require this level of action. Even if it
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.680]  did, then you might have a constitutional issue if
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.560]  they try to enshrine what the FBI is trying to do as
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.000]  regulatory action.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.560]  The big difference here, like we just mentioned a
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:27.600]  few minutes ago, though, is that on abortion, it's
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.000]  clearly polarized between the two parties. Roe v.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.120]  Wade only exacerbated that. This issue, this issue
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.680]  of encryption, splendidly so, crosses the political
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.080]  spectrum. And I almost wonder whether, if the DOJ
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.280]  wins this case against Apple, whether that actually
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:57.360]  polarizes Congress to pass a law to enshrine the
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.960]  right to strong encryption.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.440]  Oh, man, that'd be interesting. Left and right
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.160]  could join hands around the side. That's, that's
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:04.720]  always a good thing.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.200]  That it might, but it might be, like losing in court
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.080]  might inspire Congress to do that in a way that not
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.560]  having picked this fight at all, the FBI might have
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.120]  been better off, you know, from their desire,
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:21.040]  wrongheaded desire to keep these devices as
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.880]  accessible as possible. Because the other thing,
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.040]  too, the thing that's cross-platform, the other
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.200]  thing that is definitely cross-platform, and it's
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:30.480]  just common sense, but it's easy to overlook, is
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.600]  that branches of government, there are three
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.960]  branches of government don't take well to the
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.920]  usurpation of their powers by another branch. So,
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.960]  like you said, President Obama has taken, and Bush
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.520]  did too, but both of them in the face of opposition
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.360]  in Congress have taken to executive orders. And
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.480]  Congress, whatever the order is, regardless of it,
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.960]  does not take poorly, does not take well to that.
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.960]  And I think that when the judicial branch, when a
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.160]  judge passes or makes an order that Congress sees
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.840]  as that should be something that we decide, it
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.000]  doesn't matter what the issue is, it just stiffens
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.720]  their spine. They bristle, and I think rightly so.
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.560]  That's sort of the way the system is designed to
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.060]  work.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.480]  Yeah, and yeah, it's true. And I think, I mean, we
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.960]  can take this, too, from the legislature to the
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.120]  people, right? We keep reading these things, polls
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.600]  show that the support for Apple and the FBI are
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.280]  evenly split. And I'm like, all right, let's see
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:37.760]  what questions you ask. And the questions are too
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.000]  vague. I would like to see this question asked in
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.840]  like AB testing. So in one case you say, should
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.400]  Apple give the FBI the contents of the phone or
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  whatever the questions are that ask just now, and
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.120]  how are they phrased, right? The other is, should
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.160]  the FBI be allowed with legal warrant from a
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.560]  judge to access your phone at any time they deem
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.120]  there's a legal necessity for it and obtain all the
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.000]  contents absolutely in plain text, you know, in
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  some form of that. I think he'd get a different
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.120]  response if he said, you know, should a judge
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.840]  allow the FBI to examine the contents of your
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.720]  phone at any time? Well, not at any time, but in
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.120]  a criminal action with a warrant.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.320]  It's really hard to poll, too, because it's easy
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.080]  for a layperson to believe in the magic solution
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.040]  of a way for the government to get in, but
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.680]  nobody else. That only the government, you know,
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.800]  which you kind of have to be gently informed of
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.040]  the basic way that encryption works to understand
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.320]  just how dangerous and impossible it is to say,
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.000]  the only people who can get in are the US federal
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.240]  government with a warrant. It just doesn't work
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.480]  that way once you create, you know, once you
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.040]  create a backdoor. I know it's right. So there's
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.960]  like, you could actually ask, I mean, basically
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.120]  we're saying is, uh, for this poll, we need to
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:59.280]  get 10,000 people. We can give a two day class
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.920]  on cryptography and operating systems too. And
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.440]  after that, we're going to ask you a few
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.080]  questions, like.
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.800]  Yeah. And what if, what if you just proceed the
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.280]  question with, remember like, uh, 20 minutes
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.280]  ago, 30 minutes ago when I read the two quotes
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.560]  from, uh, the, the, uh, uh, the department of
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.440]  defense, the, uh, what do you call it? The who's
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.800]  in charge of the department of defense, the,
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.720]  uh, uh, secretary of defense, US secretary.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.480]  Oh, yes. And the former head of the NSA and CIA
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:31.840]  and just read those two short clear statements
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.680]  and then say, do you think Apple should be
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.360]  forced to comply with this? And then see if the
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.200]  poll results change. And it's almost certain it
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.960]  would change to some degree, whether it would
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.200]  change dramatically or mildly, but it would have
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.040]  to have some effect. So, you know, I don't go
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.040]  that this is why we don't have, this is, you
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.760]  know, it's exactly why we don't just vote on
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.360]  everything, you know, California style, just
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.200]  have voter initiatives on all this stuff. But
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.360]  that's why we have a representative democracy.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.760]  Yeah. And that's, I mean, this is the problem
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.920]  sometimes or often with jury trials, right?
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.680]  We've seen this with civil trials specifically,
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.200]  but you'd have them with criminal too is like,
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.440]  how do you get average people who, who should
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.160]  be able to solve, I mean, in many kinds of
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.720]  cases of criminality or civil liability, uh, an
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.480]  ordinary people with reasonable intelligence
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.960]  should be able to spend a few days in a courtroom,
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.960]  learn enough and be able to make an adjudication
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.520]  that's, that's ostensibly fair or reasonable,
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.000]  right? With a judge overseeing it. But how do
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.120]  you do that with encryption? How do you do
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.640]  that with most of these technical topics or
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.520]  user interface design? Like you can't, and every
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.200]  outcome is going to be arbitrary when placed in
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.320]  front of a jury. It's the same thing with polls.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.480]  The polls are a reflection of how a jury would
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.720]  probably deal with it, which would be, you know.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.640]  So one of the things, so Tim Cook a while back,
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.280]  uh, at some point, you know, not a while, but
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.960]  it's all been within the last month, but at one
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.920]  point had compared it to the creation of this
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:55.200]  government OS to cancer. Um, and I think a better
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:56.800]  analogy, I've been thinking about this, bothered
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.800]  me ever since. And a better analogy to me, it's
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.240]  close, but to me, it's a better analogy is
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.880]  chemical weapons or biological weapons. And I've
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.000]  seen other people make this comparison that
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.160]  creation of this is like creating a biological
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:11.040]  weapon. And you can say, oh, we're going to let
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.320]  you keep it in a secure place and we'll treat it.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.560]  And we're going to have, we're going to devise a
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.520]  very precise, carefully planned procedure for the
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.520]  application of it so that it's only applied in
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:29.120]  this one specific thing. Um, but that there is a
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:31.920]  very good argument that the best way to avoid the
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.320]  dangers of, of biological weapons getting out of
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.480]  your control is to never create them in the first
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.560]  place. And that to me is where the cancer analogy
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.480]  falls down is that nobody's created cancer.
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.440]  Cancer is not, uh, no, I, but I think it really
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.320]  matters though.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.240]  No, no, I think, I think you're true. It's not an
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:49.120]  intent. It's a by-product of biological processes
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.920]  and maybe pesticides and genetics and so forth.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.440]  Right. Yeah, absolutely. That is fine. I never
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.720]  thought of that analogy though. That's very
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:54.800]  funny.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.920]  And I think it's, it's a little, I think I haven't
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.680]  seen Apple repeat that analogy and I think they
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.400]  realized that it's not, it's not a, it's not a good
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.000]  enough analogy, right? Because there's this, the
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.480]  part of the argument that, or the entirety of the
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:10.080]  government's argument is that this could be
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.760]  controlled and it would never get out. Given the
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:16.000]  right precautions, it would, it would never get
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.720]  out of control. I don't know. I keep thinking
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.560]  about this. Like what if, you know, okay,
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:24.880]  government says, uh, you hospital X, um, we need
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.680]  you, uh, sisters of charitable mercy. Uh, we need
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.640]  you to, uh, to do open heart surgery on this
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.160]  individual who has a micro SD cart implanted in
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.360]  his heart and we need that data. And we, and so
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.520]  the church, you know, the hospital tries to
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.040]  oppose it. They're ordered to do so. Court
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.360]  orders them to do what surgeon goes in and does
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:46.320]  the open heart surgery, uh, you know, to do that.
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.080]  I mean, that's a one-off thing too. It's not even
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:50.000]  as bad. And it's like, okay, well, this is
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.840]  possible. Well, we have a thousand open heart
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.480]  surgeries. We need to schedule tomorrow and we
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.400]  will have surgeons trained in this now too. So
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.840]  it's very easy to do. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Not
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.440]  everybody has a chip in their heart. Um, all
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.960]  right. Let me just take a break here and thank

[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:46.240]  library at automobile. All right. What else should
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:50.000]  we talk about? Glenn? Tiny phones, tiny phones
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.040]  for tiny hands, vulgar and handed phones. Tiny,
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.760]  tiny hands. I love the idea that Donald Trump is
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.160]  bothered by it. He keeps sending, he sends the
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.680]  photocopies of his hands to, uh, what does the
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.080]  guy harder? Right. It's not like you did it once.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.920]  Like it's the green cars and every couple of
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.480]  years, he gets the story. For those of you who
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.440]  haven't the story, I'll paraphrase it. I'll put
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:19.200]  it in the show links. It's such a funny story.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.960]  And it's so telling as to Donald Trump's
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.960]  personality, but the story is, I think it might've
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.200]  even predated the vanity fair. Was it for spy
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.080]  magazine? Oh, it was first. I think it was spy.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:30.240]  That's right. All right. Well, but Graydon Carter
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:34.720]  has long been the, uh, uh, uh, editor at vanity
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.680]  fair. And before that was the editor at the late
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.520]  beloved spy magazine, which was just fantastic,
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.760]  uh, wrote a profile of Trump at like it in the
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.000]  eighties. And I think he called him a small
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.720]  handed Bulgarian small, small, small fingered,
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.280]  small fingered, small fingered, something like
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.880]  that. And in the decades since Graydon Carter
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.520]  since just said recently that, that every, you
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.480]  know, once a year, maybe two years ago by, but
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.240]  then he gets another one. Every couple, every
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:06.960]  couple of years, he gets a letter from Trump
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.520]  with like a picture from a magazine pulled out
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.840]  and, uh, in gold Sharpie circle around the hands.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.840]  And it just like a handwritten note that says,
[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:23.680]  look at those hands, not small. Uh, so, you know,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.760]  there's a, a PAC, a political action committee,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.160]  uh, was registered by a Portland, Oregon man
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.720]  called Trump has tiny hands and the federal
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.120]  election commission on Monday. So the FEC has
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.120]  been deadlocked with two members, Republican
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.440]  appointed to democratic appointed members, uh,
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.760]  destroying the ability for the FEC to enforce
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.920]  election law. And it's been going on for years
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.760]  because Congress won't approve the third
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.120]  appointee who would give the balance of power
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.360]  to the Democrats under Obama. Many, one of the
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.640]  many intransigent points here, right? Uh, FEC
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.120]  acts against this guy on Monday. FEC can't do
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:56.080]  anything. They act against this guy requiring
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.400]  the changes. Trump has tiny hands pack. So he's
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.960]  changed his name. It's now the Americans against
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.920]  insecure billionaires with tiny hands. That's
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.360]  his political action. Oh my God.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:13.920]  Do you have a Trump famously was, uh, uh,
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:17.440]  however, however, large or small his hands are
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:21.920]  a few years ago, I remember, uh, he tweeted
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.000]  something to the effect of that. This is before
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.760]  the iPhone six came out that Apple needs to put
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.400]  out a big iPhone, uh, you know, get with the
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.040]  times or something. Oh, that's funny. Yeah. So
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.680]  Trump, Trump, however small his hands are, is a
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.040]  fan of, of large phones. It's true. Well, I'm
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.880]  curious, my wife likes small phones and when I
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.880]  use her, she has an iPhone five that is failing.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.880]  And when I use it, when she hands it to me and
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.960]  she makes type large, she has little vision
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.040]  issues. So she makes type large and I use it and
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.800]  I feel like I'm using a fairy phone. I'm like
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.960]  little tiny fairies use this phone. And so, and
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.480]  I'm like, how many years did I use a phone that
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.960]  was that size or smaller? And it seemed fine. I
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.240]  have an iPhone six S and now the iPhone five
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.480]  size, five S size seems ridiculous, but she's
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:03.040]  waiting. Her phone is failing. If the se ships
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.920]  are as announced on Monday as expected, then
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.480]  she's a customer. I would call it as a customer.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.280]  I would argue that in a certain sense, I don't
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:14.240]  know what the volume is, but in a, in a hand feel
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:15.920]  sense, I would argue that the iPhone five and
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.320]  five S are the smallest iPhone Apple ever made.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.400]  And I know that the screen got bigger. It went
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:22.800]  from three and a half to four, but it's so much
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.800]  thinner that to me it feels smaller. And I, I
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.880]  have my little museum here of old iPhones, uh,
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.280]  that because of the thinness, it feels smaller in
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.800]  the hand that it feels like the smallest iPhone
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.520]  they ever read that. That is probably it. You're
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:40.800]  right by volume and like screen edge dimensions.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.440]  Yes. Maybe by volume, it's not because of the
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:46.320]  extra length of, to accommodate the four inch
[01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:49.200]  screen as opposed to 3.5, but because you hold it
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.240]  sideways, typically you don't really hold it end
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.360]  to end that the volume that matters is sort of
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.560]  like the, you know, like the bottom half of the
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:01.520]  phone. That's true. Or like the bottom, you know,
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.760]  two, three inches is the, really the volume that
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.920]  matters and that the, whatever sticks up off the
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:09.440]  top doesn't really count. I think it's going to
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.360]  be a big seller. I hope it actually is a real
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.280]  thing. It seems very reliably so that it's a real
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.080]  thing. And, uh, it's, it's fun to watch. I mean,
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.160]  Apple has that, uh, matrix who did that a few
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.920]  years ago before something came out, the iPad
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.560]  mini or something came out where someone built
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.360]  this, like this fan of like all the devices and
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.440]  sizes and prices. And they said, here are the
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.280]  holes than Apple release devices that fit in
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.080]  those holes. I feel like the, the se is absolutely
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.640]  one of those holes right now. Uh, I think it's
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640]  fascinating that here we are, we're recording on
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.720]  Wednesday, March 16th. And I think the show is
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.920]  going to air on Thursday. Um, I don't know when
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:43.760]  people will listen. Hopefully they'll listen
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.080]  before the event on Monday, but who knows what
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:48.800]  will leak at the last possible minute. But it's
[01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.280]  fascinating to me that the phone hasn't leaked.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.520]  And I know that there was like a CAD drawing
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.600]  that, uh, one of the rumors sites, I don't know
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.240]  if it was nine to five Mac or Mac rumors, probably
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.320]  nine to five Mac, but they had like a CAD
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:04.240]  rendering that they then interpreted as a, you
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.600]  know, made like a rendering out of, but we don't
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600]  really know, like the parts didn't leak. There's
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.880]  nobody who's held up a part that says, here's the,
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:15.440]  you know, here's the casing for the iPhone se.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:17.920]  And I, I, it makes me wonder if it's shipping
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.760]  like a month and they, but I can't imagine they
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.920]  can do the event and say, and you can order this
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.520]  for shipping on May 1st. It's going to be
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.520]  available day and date. I have to believe
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.200]  I think German says by Friday, which is actually
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.680]  kind of interesting. My, you know, just my own
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.560]  selfish interests that it's, I'm going to the
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.080]  event. I'll be at the event. I guess since I'm
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.200]  going that I'll probably get one to review, but
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.960]  if they're shipping it on Friday, I don't, I'm not
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:45.200]  quite sure how, how I write a review before it
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:45.760]  actually ships.
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.720]  Yeah, that's it. It seems the, I'm doing a Monday
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.120]  event. Yeah. Although on the other hand, maybe
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.520]  it's a very easy device to review. It's, it's back
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.880]  to the old size and it's got the new specs and,
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:04.480]  you know, I think I'm going to like it. I think
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.400]  I'm going to, I don't know that I'll switch from
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.200]  the four seven, but I might be very tempted to,
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.600]  I, I it's, it's going to be a close call for me.
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.080]  I love that they're, I mean, if this happens, it
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:18.160]  seems so likely, I love that they're doing it
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.560]  because, uh, uh, we've talked, uh, I've talked to
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.080]  some other folks about the notion that we're
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.760]  getting to post numbering that maybe this is, or
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.840]  maybe this model never gets numbered. I think
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:29.920]  you've written about that too. Is that like, at
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:33.120]  some point, like, you know, the iPad three was
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.800]  they called the iPad two and the iPad three. Then
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.400]  it became the iPad and, um, numbers are bad for
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.360]  Apple, except if they're trying to create demand,
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.840]  like a poll of demand for the newer thing. And I
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.960]  think sales figures and growth may show that they
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.760]  just need to be shipping out devices. Um, maybe
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:51.920]  not creating the expectation that it's
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.240]  every September in the same way and the new
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.080]  plans. I mean, the thing is with a lot of people
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.920]  shifting to, shifting to installment plans that
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.400]  allow an upgrade after either 12 or 18 months,
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.480]  I think we're going to see, seems like the
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.560]  majority of people in the U S will wind up on a
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.640]  plan with either a 12 or 18 month refresh and
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.920]  some with like a, you know, 20 or 24 month where,
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:12.320]  um, they don't pay any extra for that. That's
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.560]  going to flood the market with older phones in
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.320]  some fashion, there'll be resold or there'll be,
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.000]  uh, you know, uh, refurbished and available.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.760]  And then, um, you have all these people like,
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.520]  I mean, Hey, look, I'm on an installment plan.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:25.120]  Am I going to get an iPhone seven or whatever
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.200]  it's called? Probably because I feel like that's
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.360]  my Apple fee is now I'm paying, I don't know what
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.240]  is 56 bucks a month. I'll just pay that forever
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.480]  for my phone and I'll just always have the
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.320]  freshest phone. Like that does not seem like a
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.040]  penalty to me, um, the way they're marketing it.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:42.720]  Yeah. To me, I think it'll probably personally
[01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:46.960]  come down to image quality. I think that, or,
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.240]  you know, for the camera that if.
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:49.760]  Yeah. You want your 12 megapixel one.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.520]  Well, I don't care about the megapixel camera.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.840]  I'm sorry, but like a better, right. That's the
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:54.960]  field. I want depth of field.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:57.040]  Well, you're not going to get that in this
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:59.280]  camp. You know what I mean? It's not going to
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:02.160]  move. It's not going to move forward, but if to
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.480]  me, it looks like I can take the same quality
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.280]  pictures in the same lighting conditions as my
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.160]  iPhone six S more or less that it, you know, at
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:13.760]  least to my eyes, it looks like I'm getting the
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:15.680]  same image quality. I think I would prefer the
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.720]  smaller phone. I like the way it feels in my
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.920]  hand. I like the way it is smaller in my pocket.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.040]  Um, and I, to be honest, the majority of what I
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.280]  read on, uh, the phone is Twitter and tweets
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.480]  because they're so small. It doesn't matter that
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.720]  I can see more of them at a time on a larger
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.040]  screen phone. Um, and I, you know, I read, I do
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.440]  read a lot of articles on mobile Safari, but I
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.440]  don't, I never minded it that much. You know,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:48.560]  like to me, both screens are small and constrained
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.920]  for reading articles and you just reflow them
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.080]  with, uh, you know, reader view or something
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.000]  like that. So big screen to me, isn't all that
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  appealing. I see, you know, it is certainly a
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.080]  trade-off, but in terms of the smaller device
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:04.160]  sized, I don't know. I think I'm on the fence. Me
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:04.660]  and molt.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.600]  Yeah. I liked having the smaller phone. I mean,
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:09.600]  this comes back to, Hey, apparently we're both
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.280]  guys. So there's an issue there, which is that we
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.000]  don't have the tiny unusable pockets or no pockets
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.080]  that a lot of women have in their clothing. Uh,
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:18.160]  my friend Aaron McKean, who's at word Nick, the
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.240]  head of that great site, that's collecting like
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.040]  open source definitions of words, um, the
[01:41:23.040 --> 01:41:25.760]  nonprofit project. Uh, she likes to make her own
[01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.760]  dresses, makes wonderful stuff, wrote about it for
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:30.400]  the magazine years ago. And, uh, she puts pockets
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.840]  and stuff and she has people stopping her all the
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:33.520]  time. Wait, you have pockets in your clothing.
[01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.680]  How that happens? Like I made the dress. So
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.000]  there's pockets in it. Uh, a wife encounters this
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.240]  all the time and my wife wears, you know, stylish,
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.880]  but not like, um, like a fashion, absurdly
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:46.080]  stylish, unusable clothing. And, um, got to think
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.000]  like that was the thing with the iPhone six or
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.640]  if I don't know, uh, six plus when it came out, I
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:52.240]  thought I don't want to phone that big, but I'm
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:54.160]  not going to prejudge it because Apple knows the
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:56.560]  market better. And I am like one tiny segment now
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.400]  of the market. I don't want a gold phone. I don't
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.360]  want a gold watch. I don't want whatever. Uh, and
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.400]  I, a lot of women I know, uh, liked the six plus
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.680]  because they already keeping a phone in their
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.920]  purse. And this was like, this is great. I can
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.640]  read it and it doubles as a Kindle and it serves
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:12.880]  many purposes. And a lot of women in some men I
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.880]  know, uh, but I would say more of the women I know
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.880]  got it than men. Although several men we know,
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.960]  like Mike Hurley and so forth are big fans of it.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.680]  Um, I feel like the, the SE is definitely ties
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.840]  more into that, like the small pocket thing or
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.320]  small, like not having a lot of room or stuff to
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.800]  carry. It's going to be for an audience that I
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.480]  think has been underserved and the five S is
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.200]  filled that gap.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.280]  I'm so, uh, I'm excited to go out for this event
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.320]  because I so don't know, I have a good guess what
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:41.760]  they're going to show us, but, but I have no idea
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.760]  how they're going to sell it to us, which to me is
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:45.840]  interesting because there's two main things that
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.920]  they've got. They've got the smaller phone and
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:51.360]  they got the, uh, the, the new iPad pro that's
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.080]  only 9.7 inches, which is effectively just a
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:56.800]  smaller iPad pro. So how do they, how do they get
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:59.360]  on stage and sell two devices that are, it's
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.440]  exactly like the thing we announced in September,
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.840]  but right that neither of them are going to do
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.800]  anything better than the ones that are already on
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:09.440]  the market.
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.880]  I wonder if they'll talk about it as a family of
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.800]  devices. We know people have different needs and
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.720]  different demands and the five S has been, I won't
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.400]  mention the five S they never talk backwards,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.160]  right? But like we've, you know, we filled this
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.320]  category in the past and now, and we felt we could
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.200]  do something unique and new and this is what we're
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.400]  doing to fill out our product line, to fit a family
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.000]  of needs, right? Something like that.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.760]  I don't know.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.200]  They have to say something new though. There's
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.880]  always a new thing that this is the reason why we
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.640]  waited till now to do this. What is it?
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.200]  We don't know.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.040]  I don't know. Yeah. I don't know how it's just
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.720]  like the last thing with smaller, how they get
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.120]  something new out of it. I, there must be, but I,
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.640]  that's why the campaign is last thing, but smaller
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:45.440]  and think different.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.040]  Do you think, here's a question I've had, I keep
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:51.680]  meaning to ask this on Twitter, but, uh, I'll ask
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:55.840]  you, do you think they will come out with the, uh,
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:58.560]  smart battery pack for the iPhone SE?
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:02.400]  That's a great question. I just, uh, I was working
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.000]  for Wirecutter for a while and I worked on this,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.080]  uh, USB battery guide, not the battery. We didn't
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.840]  do the battery pack that was, uh, Dan Frakes, my
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.080]  old friend Dan Frakes, uh, worked on the battery
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:14.560]  pack, uh, uh, upfront when that came out. Um, but, uh, looking
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.400]  at a lot of batteries that are out there and what's
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:20.240]  capable and what the capacity of this thing will
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:23.840]  likely be. I have a hard time believing it because I
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.680]  think the whole idea of this one is going to be that
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.880]  sort of like a very specific form, right? So if you
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.480]  come out with it and a battery pack, you're under
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.840]  selling what this phone is about, uh, because they
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.840]  are so much more efficient with power than with the
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.240]  F the five S I would bet they could eat 30 or 40
[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.520]  percent more power out of the same form factor than
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:48.160]  they can out of the F S with a similar as you're
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:50.880]  using the same battery capacity. And so extensively
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.120]  you'll have a slightly bigger battery because they're
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.640]  better at that or slightly denser perhaps. Um, and
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.320]  everything will be so much more efficient. And
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:01.680]  because the screen is so much smaller by area and by
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.200]  pixel count it re and that, you know, they perfected
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.600]  that it would be hard to believe that they would
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600]  want it. I mean, would you want to like, I understand
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.440]  the six S it makes a lot of sense because it's kind
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.480]  of in the middle there and people, I mean, USB battery
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:18.880]  packs of all kinds, not just the ones that I think
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.120]  cases have sold so well. I think if they do, it will
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.760]  roll out on the same schedule that the battery pack
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.480]  for the success did, which is, you know, six weeks
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:31.200]  after the phone comes out, don't steal a thunder.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.400]  Yeah. And here's something, Hey, and don't, don't risk
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:38.960]  the, the PR backlash of Apple releases a phone that
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:41.920]  needs an external battery pack. Yeah. Right. I mean,
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.520]  they got that anyway when they released their own
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:46.080]  battery pack, but at, at, by the time November rolled
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.160]  around, it was a lot quieter than if they had done it
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:50.640]  on stage. Can I, can I talk batteries for a second?
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:52.480]  Cause I can't tell you how many batteries I've tested
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.600]  in. I did this thing at the wire cutter. We did a USB
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:58.480]  battery pack guide with a great writer there, Mark
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:01.360]  Smirniotis who did a fantastic job, used a battery
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:04.960]  testing lab, Cadix up in Vancouver, BC. It was
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:07.040]  fascinating. And then I did a bunch of reviews for
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.800]  Mac world just a few weeks ago of USB-C equipped
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.680]  batteries. And Oh my God, if you haven't touched a
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.760]  battery, like a USB battery, if you like a few years
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.520]  ago were like, ah, these are sort of terrible and
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:20.320]  expensive and they don't last long. The next generation
[01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.720]  is out and like across all these different
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.080]  manufacturers and you can get, you can charge the one
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.320]  that I liked best in the Mac world roundup was the
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:33.680]  Anker has a 20,100 milliampere hour battery with
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.600]  USB-C and USB regular USB.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.720]  20,000?
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:40.160]  20,000 and it costs 50 bucks and you can charge
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:44.080]  your Mac book about 110% from it. A 12 inch Mac
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.040]  book. That's, I know when I was like, you know, I
[01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.320]  was kind of watching batteries a little bit. I
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.480]  hadn't got into it. And the circuitry is so much
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.640]  better. They hold a charge for the new, like the
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.120]  new lithium ion cells that are being used, hold a
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.080]  charge better. They're so much better at conversion.
[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:01.200]  They don't heat up as much. It's really
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:03.040]  extraordinary. So if you've been holding back on
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:05.040]  a USB, I sound like an ad for the industry, but
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.200]  it is complicated though. I actually looked into
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.960]  it a couple of weeks ago and I was going to do a
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:10.880]  wire cutter style thing where I actually bought
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.640]  like three or four just for the phone. It was
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.120]  right after I did the battery case review and I
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:18.240]  thought, you know what? I should review these
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.240]  little portable things. Cause I've long had one.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.520]  It's a couple of year or two old, a Mophie that
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.760]  has like a Mophie. My problem with Mophie is Mophie
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.960]  alone has too many. They have too many. They also
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.520]  charge four times what you need to pay. It makes
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:36.560]  it so hard to figure out what to buy. Just anybody
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.640]  at Mophie who listens to the show, please, for the
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.120]  love of God, just get rid of three quarters of your
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:43.360]  product lineup and just keep, you know, just tell
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:45.280]  me what's the best one to get. Cause they have like
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:47.120]  different, even just form factors of them. But
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:48.480]  anyway, they've got one that I really liked that
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.360]  has built in a built in USB cable and a built, not
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.120]  like, and it does pass through charging.
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.360]  Does it do, is it, now that pass through is an
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.960]  interesting thing, but does it do, so it's got a
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:04.560]  type A connector you can plug into a DC adapter.
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.200]  Yeah, like a standard DC adapter.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:08.560]  Doesn't have lightning though, right?
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:09.760]  No, it does have lightning. It has a built in
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:09.760]  lightning.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:11.760]  It has lightning and type A. Oh, see that's great.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:14.240]  And you can get that. There's a travel card. If you
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:17.840]  want a really tiny one, has a lightning and type A
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.480]  thing that they talk in.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.480]  Wait, what's type A? Type A means you plug it into
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.680]  the charger, right?
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:23.520]  Yeah. Type A is like the rec, the standard
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:25.920]  rectangular one. And, and that's what you mostly
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.280]  see, that's the computer side one, you know, USB C
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.040]  or type A is what you're going to see on computers
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:34.240]  and all the AC adapters are type A, those
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.280]  rectangular plugs. But travel card is really, is
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.200]  really neat because it has the integral lightning
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.120]  MFA, MFI approved or licensed certified whatever
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.520]  and, and the one, so you only, you don't have to
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:47.280]  carry any extra cable with a travel card. I think
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.160]  it's like 40 bucks, so it's expensive or 35 and it
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.800]  only charged your phone like, I don't know, like
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.400]  two thirds the way or something, but like an
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:56.240]  iPhone six. But if that's what you need, if you're
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.520]  like the question, the thing we did with the
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.080]  wire cutters, we divided it up into, do you need
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.480]  it to top off at the end, your full day at work or
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.400]  away and you need to get through the night or to
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.400]  the end of an evening? Or do you want to be able
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.200]  to charge like for another full day of usage or
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:12.560]  on the road for like a week and you got an iPad?
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.080]  So you can get things that are now a
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:16.240]  differentiation. You get anything from like, oh,
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.520]  Amazon, Amazon basics. It doesn't have a lightning
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.160]  cable, but it will take a regular plug. You can
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:26.480]  plug your cable into it, your regular adapter.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.360]  2000 milliampere hour battery from Amazon. It'll
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.440]  charge a phone. I think the resulting charge is
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.320]  at least half or two thirds. It's five or six
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.480]  bucks as an Amazon basics add on. So you can go
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.920]  all the way from that up to like 25,000 milliampere
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.880]  hour, like ravpower and some others that'll charge
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.600]  an iPad like six times or something. That's
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.360]  really, it's really interesting to think about. I
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:48.880]  mean, I've always used them in the context of
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.320]  charging a phone, but it's interesting to think
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.720]  about charging like a Mac book that way with, and
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.360]  getting like a, you know, like a hundred, like you
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:59.440]  said 110% charge out of the anchor is amazing.
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:00.880]  Anchor is a fascinating company. It's like a
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.800]  Google engineer and his wife started this up and
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.400]  she started the business, I think. And then he
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:07.200]  eventually quit Google. They moved back to China.
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.400]  I think they were from China originally. Cause
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.160]  they moved back there. I think it's what he said.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.920]  And now they're shipping like, I don't know,
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:14.560]  a hundred thousand items a month or something
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:16.400]  like they came from. No, they're, I love anchor
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.400]  quality. It's like, it's really great. They have
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.800]  a whole lineup of stuff. And, and they're making,
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.400]  they're kind of pushing it. So that what, what
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.400]  happened really is that a lot of companies,
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:28.400]  Panasonic, LG, and a bunch of other firms started
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:30.640]  to make really good standardized, you know,
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:32.720]  essentially lithium ion cells. They they're
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.120]  varying sizes. They're cylinders like a double A
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.760]  battery, but can be bigger or smaller. And these
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  standardized components mean that nobody in the
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.240]  chain has to build that part. And they're all such
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.160]  high quality or blah, they're very high quality
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.280]  now that it's so affordable. They can stick three
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.240]  or six or eight into a thing with a, you know,
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.640]  some circuitry to handle charging and USB
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.800]  conversion and get, you know, so it's really all
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:56.960]  about like packaging and engineering of taking
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.720]  this commodity item and making it something
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:02.640]  better. It's cool. It's the new, it's the future.
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:05.520]  I, I, the gist of my experimentation with these
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  Mophie ones, and I bought two of the other ones
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.000]  that don't have built-in cables and you instead
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.320]  have to supply your own lightning cable to charge
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.880]  your phone from it. But the other ones are more
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.920]  like, almost like basically like iPhone size
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.680]  batteries. They're, you know, they're thin, like
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.000]  an iPhone and a varying sizes depending on their
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.920]  capacity, but you have to supply your own cable.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.680]  The thing that really makes them work well for
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.200]  me is when you buy, uh, like from Amazon basics,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.960]  or I actually bought a couple from, um, I forget
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:35.920]  the name of the company. What's the name of the
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:38.000]  company you buy real cheap cables at? Uh,
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:38.800]  Oh, Monoprice.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:43.360]  Monoprice. So I bought a bunch of these little
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.480]  like three inch lightning cables, which in a lot
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:48.720]  of contexts make no sense at all, but like for
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.720]  just putting a battery in your pocket while it
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.280]  charges the phone, it's absolutely perfect
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.520]  because then you don't have like the, to me,
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.360]  before I bought one of these little cables to go
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.080]  with it, the whole, the whole thing that was such
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.160]  a pain and looked ridiculous is what do you do
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.560]  with a three foot cable when you're charging it
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:08.000]  in a device that's in your pocket? These little
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.760]  like two or three inch lightning cables are
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:12.320]  perfect for that. So, and to me, it's a better
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.800]  solution than the Apple battery pack or any
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.880]  battery pack for that matter, because unless
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.720]  you really want to use the battery pack every
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.680]  single day, at which point, at which point I
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.440]  really question whether you shouldn't just get
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.280]  the iPhone plus size. If, if that's, you know,
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.680]  if you really want it all the time, every day,
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:32.560]  why don't you just buy the iPhone plus? Well,
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.920]  this is the thing that's interesting too, having
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:36.400]  gone through all this battery stuff is USB is a
[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.560]  huge bottleneck. And so including lightning,
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:40.720]  there's only a maximum amount of power you can
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:45.440]  push into an iPhone or iPad battery or even
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.840]  recharges. I'm testing 20,000 milliampere hour
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.560]  batteries. It takes hours to drain these things.
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.560]  I got this thing, I had to order it from Japan.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:54.160]  It's this beautiful little device, cannot get
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:57.520]  it in America. That's a load generator. It pulls
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:00.080]  two amps of load or up to like three, I think
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.880]  off a USB port and dissipates it as heat. So I
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.720]  could drain the damn thing. So I could test to
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:07.120]  see how fast they charge. There's a new quick
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.520]  charge two and three of these standards from
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.840]  Qualcomm that are being built into Android phones
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:14.080]  and some other phones that can charge at higher
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.200]  voltages. So they can, they charge at a relatively
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.680]  low amperage high voltage, and they can recharge
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:21.920]  battery like two or three times faster than at
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.080]  USB voltages, even at high amperages. So USB-C
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.680]  is interesting because USB-C boosts the overall
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.080]  like wattage that you can put into something. So
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:35.120]  if an iPad Pro would actually really good with
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.840]  USB-C because it could safely charge its battery
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:40.720]  like four or five times faster than the limits
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:43.200]  that USB puts on it. It's why, I mean, iPad Pro,
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:44.720]  I'd love to talk to some people about that.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.840]  What if, what if, well, is lightning definitely
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.160]  a limiting factor? What if the lightning cable
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:53.840]  started with USB-C to get the power and then was
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.320]  lightning into the device? That's a good question.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:59.760]  I believe that lightning has a wattage limit that
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.960]  is below what you can do with USB-C by a large
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:06.800]  factor. So, oh man, of course, I don't know what
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.680]  the limit is. I think it's, I think it's only 15
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.640]  watts you can put over lightning and you can do,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.200]  you know, the MacBook charges, it has a 29 watt
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.560]  charger and USB-C can have up to a hundred watts
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.920]  on a cable. You wouldn't want to do that with an
[01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.960]  iPad Pro, but even like a 30, a 29 watt or 30 watt
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.080]  charger for the iPad Pro, I think would, like I
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.760]  say, at least double or maybe even be 60 or 70%
[01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:31.760]  more than you can do with lightning's limits.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:34.720]  One of the basic rules of computer technology in
[01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.200]  general is that anything that's slow will
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.440]  eventually be faster. Right? It's true. And you
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.520]  just accept it. Like you just, we used to just
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.880]  accept that it took 90 seconds to copy a 1.4
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:49.360]  megabyte floppy disk. We just accepted that. I
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:50.400]  mean, because what are you going to do? You got
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:54.880]  to wait. And now, you know, the idea that you'd
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:58.240]  wait a long period, a noticeable period of time
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:02.400]  to copy one megabyte of data, it's laughable. So
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:05.520]  what's slow today? Charging. Listening to you
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:08.240]  talk about this. Charging is slow. And it's like,
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:12.800]  you know, we develop habits to avoid having to
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:14.720]  worry about it. Charging overnight, charging
[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:17.360]  while we're at our desk. But like, you know, like
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.840]  my son is not good with remembering to do it. And
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:21.600]  it's like if you're going on a road trip and it's
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.600]  it or you're heading to the airport and its phone
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.080]  is already in the red, it's like, Oh God, what are
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.080]  you thinking? You know, but it's, and that's when
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:31.040]  you really notice, boy, a phone does not take a
[01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:34.000]  charge very quickly when you're in a hurry. No,
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.520]  that's a big, I think that's a big thing. And
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.120]  that's why I mean, Qualcomm, this is where they're
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.040]  trying to innovate on the opposite side. And I'm
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:40.960]  sure they would love Apple to adopt this and
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:43.200]  Apple's not going to adopt quick charge. I don't
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.560]  think because it's doesn't, it's not like a
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.640]  lightning based thing. But I've got a couple of
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.920]  quick charge, three chargers here. They can't
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.520]  afford to be left behind though. You know what I
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:54.000]  mean? Like they have USB-C though, they can go to
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  USB-C and then they don't have to do quick charge.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.400]  They can push more amperage or I think it's a
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.080]  combination of amperage and wattage through. I
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:02.560]  wonder, I wonder if they could do a lightning two
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:06.240]  that would increase the amperage, but would be
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:11.200]  physically compatible. I think USB-C is the
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:13.360]  direction. And I'm, I'm just wondering if
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.200]  lightning, I mean, I know this has been a battle.
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.360]  We've been talking about this since USB-C. It
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:19.760]  became a thing that Apple wanted to do is like,
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:22.000]  it's really tricky to put a USB. It's only
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.840]  slightly larger than lightning, but it's tricky to
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:26.560]  put it in iPhone. But I think it's probably the
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.640]  right approach. I don't, I don't think the Apple's
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.240]  ever going to put USB-C on their devices.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.080]  I know, I know. I wonder if they would add, this
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:33.920]  is, they were never going to add a second port
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.840]  on an iPad, right? But they should have a USB-C
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.680]  port on an iPad Pro. It's not going to happen.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.840]  I think lightning is becoming inadequate to the
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:42.800]  task. And I think that they're going to have to
[01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.080]  cope with that eventually.
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:46.240]  Yeah. I wonder, I wonder how much of this they've
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.040]  foresaw and how much now they're like, painted
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:49.680]  ourselves in a corner.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.120]  Yeah, you're totally right though. They could
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:53.520]  have, no, lightning two could actually be
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.240]  lightning two could have USB-C on one end and
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:58.240]  lightning two on the other and the same cable
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.400]  thing, and it's backwards compatible. But if
[01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:02.400]  you've got lightning two circuitry and a
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:04.320]  lightning two cable, you get to charge that.
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.080]  You totally, I mean, that is totally feasible.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:08.000]  I forget that. So that, that could be where
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.760]  they're going and then they're going to take
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:11.840]  advantage of the USB-C infrastructure for having
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.360]  chargers and other stuff. And they're really
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.680]  push it that way. But yeah, I mean, you don't
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:17.760]  want to take like seven hours to recharge an
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.160]  iPad Pro battery. That doesn't make sense, right?
[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.960]  You want it to take like three or two.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:26.720]  That's the thing. But on the other hand, you
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:28.240]  know, this Anker, this one I was talking about
[01:57:28.240 --> 01:57:30.560]  that I like it's, it weighs like a pound or
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:36.080]  something. It's a pound, 20 amp hours and 50
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:37.520]  bucks. So you're sort of like, all right, well,
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.760]  if I need to carry something extra, I can get
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.840]  one of these things and then I'm sort of set.
[01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:45.040]  And anyway, it's such an, it's such a like
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.120]  wonky little area, but it battery life is the
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:49.040]  thing that affects us more. I mean, you know,
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.720]  network speed hasn't been solved, but you can
[01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:54.080]  get LTE in most places pretty good. And so
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.920]  battery is the next frontier to kind of
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:56.880]  resolve.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:58.560]  No, I definitely, I mean, there's no doubt
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:01.520]  about it. That battery life is the biggest.
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.400]  It's the lagging technology at the moment.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.800]  It's fun too. I learned so much about what
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.520]  hours and see like the number. There's a thing
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:11.760]  about like how much columns you can stick into
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:14.320]  a battery fast enough without damaging it. And
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.120]  in some it's, it's wild. Like you get into that
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:18.880]  and it's like people spend a lot of time doing
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.960]  a lot of little formulas to make sure everything
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:22.880]  matches up correctly.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.200]  My sixth grade battery or not battery, uh, my
[01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.920]  sixth grade science fair project was on battery
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:28.400]  batteries.
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:30.320]  You're out of your time.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.800]  I did a very, I did a poor job on it. I think I
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.600]  got like a B. I don't even think I got a B plus.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.920]  Look, Mike, my son, my son's in sixth grade.
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.720]  One of his comrades did a hovercraft using a
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:43.440]  modified electric leaf blower that actually
[01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:45.520]  hovers and carries 75 pounds. This is the
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:46.560]  science fairs today.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.040]  I really, I really have asked my sixth grade
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:52.320]  science fair project. Uh, my, the, the, the
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:57.120]  test was, uh, not whether alkaline batteries
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:59.920]  lasted longer. That was self-evident than, uh,
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.680]  regular. I remember at the time, I mean, all
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:03.360]  you can buy now are alkaline batteries. Like
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.760]  we're talking about like double A or C, those
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.800]  types of batteries. Uh, there were, there were
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:12.080]  regular, there were heavy duty, quote unquote,
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:15.280]  and, uh, alkaline like the door sell and, and
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.600]  energizer. And so my test wasn't whether they
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.280]  actually lasted longer. Of course they did. It
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:22.800]  was whether you at consumer prices, whether
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:25.040]  you were getting more bang for your buck with
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:28.400]  them. And while it sounds clever and it got,
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.920]  it was like good enough to get the thing
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.240]  approved, but it really turned out to be not,
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:34.560]  not a very exciting test. And it was actually
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:36.640]  devilishly hard because of what I, the way the
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:40.480]  test I devised was to use, uh, uh, the same
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:44.320]  flashlight and put the C batteries in and then
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.160]  turn the flashlight on note the time and then
[01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.240]  note the time it went off. But no finding out
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.200]  what time a flashlight burned out is. Oh my God.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.280]  This is hilarious. This was a wire cutters
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.200]  battery guy. He read a review with this exact
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:57.600]  same problem. They put a, they put a flashlight
[01:59:57.600 --> 01:59:59.680]  and they were videotaping a flashlight pointing
[01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:01.680]  into a box was how he ultimately did it. I think
[02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.480]  see, I didn't have a video camera though. That
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.880]  is actually a 12 hour video tape, right? I
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.400]  wouldn't have had a 12 hour video tape. And it
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.400]  got to the point where my parents got a little
[02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:12.880]  mad. I mean, this was not the, this was not the
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:14.880]  most expensive scientific test that was ever
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.960]  performed, but it did seem like I kept saying I
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.880]  need more batteries. Oh my God. They're
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:22.720]  expensive. And so I kind of had to triangulate
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:25.440]  like based on when it seemed it was going off
[02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.520]  in the middle of the night. Okay. So if I started
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.520]  it at 5 PM and it went off in the middle of the
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:31.360]  night, how about I start the next one at nine in
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.720]  the morning before I go or at eight in the
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:37.040]  morning before I go to school. And it was like
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:38.800]  petitioning my sister and my parents, like every
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.320]  time you go buy this flashlight, see if it's on.
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.640]  All right. One more thing. Just talking about
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:44.160]  batteries. Batteries are so exciting. I know the
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.160]  listeners are delighted about it. There's a new
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:48.480]  kind of AA battery, a new kind of lithium battery
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:51.200]  you can get. It's not a lithium, it's called,
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.000]  what is it? Oh, I'm blanking on the name here.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.680]  It's a nickel metal hydride. Oh, it's not
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.280]  lithium. What is it? There's new batteries you
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:01.680]  can get now that perform rechargeables that
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:04.320]  perform so much better than the old ones because
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.720]  they've changed the fundamental like chemistry
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:09.040]  of them. So in the past you would get really
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:13.760]  terrible recharging performance. And now you
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.880]  get, there's so much better because of this
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:19.520]  thing. So you get this, it cycles like 500 to a
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:25.040]  thousand times. It'll maintain a charge longer,
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.640]  like all the things that used to drive you nuts
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:29.040]  about rechargeable batteries. The new generation
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:32.000]  now is avoiding that. When Jonas was younger
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.880]  and he had a lot of kids toys, I did the right
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:36.560]  thing. I volunteered. I took this, undertook
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.560]  this myself and I did the right thing and bought
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.840]  like 40 AA rechargeables and 40 AAA for the
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:46.000]  toys that took the whole, just a whole slew of
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.600]  these. I think I got them from a company called
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.520]  like green battery or something like that. That
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:52.640]  was highly rated and a charger that would charge
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:54.640]  a bunch of them at once. And then for all of his
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.360]  toys, we use them. But it's, it quickly became
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:00.560]  clear that boy, they ran out faster than like
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.960]  alc, like it was so tempting to just buy the big
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:05.760]  pack of door SLs and put, put them in there.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:07.920]  That's what we went from rechargeables to Costco
[02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.520]  alkalines. And I always felt terrible. I'm like,
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:11.920]  I'm destroying the earth because, you know,
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.840]  instead of being able to use a few second sense
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.840]  of electricity because they weren't reliable,
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:18.160]  but over time, almost everything I have is
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.320]  lithium ion battery powered now anyway, it all
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:22.080]  has an internal battery. So I have very, very few
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:22.960]  things that require one.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:26.160]  Yeah. They seem to do really poorly in remote
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.840]  controls too, for some reason. Cause like
[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.800]  replacing the batteries in a remote seems like
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:33.040]  something that you should only have to do like,
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:36.720]  you know, like, I don't know, more than a year,
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:38.560]  right? I don't know. I haven't, I haven't
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.800]  changed the battery in our remotes in a long
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.960]  time. Whereas when we were using those, those
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.800]  rechargeables, it seemed like it was like all
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.300]  the time.
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.480]  Yeah. These new, this new generation, what do
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.680]  they call their nickel? No, they are their
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.280]  nickel metal hydride, nickel metal hydride,
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:59.040]  NIMH, low self discharge, LSD. I don't know
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:00.960]  where you'd heard LSD before. That doesn't seem
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.120]  like a problematic abbreviation. They, they
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:07.920]  last for sometimes I think now it's, they have
[02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.080]  months or even years where they'll maintain
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.520]  their, um, charge and they can do, like I say,
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.600]  hundreds, 2000 plus cycles. So, and that these
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.960]  are relatively new. So if you're buying
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:21.120]  batteries like three to five years ago, you'd
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.360]  be frustrated. And if you buy this generation
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.040]  and the, and you have to carefully, like I
[02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:27.440]  said, wire cutter is good review of them and
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:29.360]  you have to look for brands and types. Cause
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.360]  some of them vary even among capacities. They
[02:03:31.360 --> 02:03:33.280]  can be better or worse, but a much better
[02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:34.080]  experience.
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:35.520]  All right, let me take one last break here and
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.120]  thank our final sponsor of the show. It's our
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:38.640]  good friends at fracture. You guys know
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:40.400]  fracture. They're the company that prints
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.840]  photos directly onto glass. You can go to
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.120]  fracture me.com. And if you use the code talk
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.520]  show 10, just talk show one zero, you'll get
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.000]  10% off your first order. The code is easy to
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.440]  remember. Talk show 10, 10 is the 10%. You'll
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.080]  save off your order. Now here's the thing. The
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:06.240]  fracture pictures look great. They make awesome
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:09.680]  gifts. They make a great way to take the photos
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.000]  that you have on your phone in your iCloud
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.960]  account that you've never actually printed and
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:18.960]  put them into the analog world. It's the best
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:21.040]  way to do it because they print them right on
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:23.200]  class. They ship in these amazing packages that
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:24.640]  have everything you need to hang them up on the
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.120]  wall, all included. So you don't need to frame
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.200]  them. They are a frame. It's just an edge to edge
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.520]  piece of glass. That's ready to pop on the wall,
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:33.920]  prop up on your desk, put it on the mantle. Could
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.400]  not be easier. And you never have to worry about
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.080]  all the stupid little fiddly things you do when
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:41.360]  you get a regular printed photo on paper into a
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.200]  frame where it has to be perfectly aligned. And
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.680]  then you seal the frame back up and it tilts off
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:47.840]  2% and you have to open up the frame again and
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:49.760]  redirect it and try to get it to stick. So it's
[02:04:49.760 --> 02:04:51.440]  perfectly aligned. Forget it. You don't have to
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.160]  do any of that. You'll get a better looking image
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:57.440]  and a better quality and a much more impressive
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:03.600]  display from Fracture. And so it's better quality
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:08.240]  and it's easier. So you can't lose. Each fracture
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:09.840]  is hand assembled and checked for quality by
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.160]  their small team in Gainesville, Florida. They're
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:14.560]  great people, a great company, and they really do.
[02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.240]  In addition to having a great product, they really
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:19.760]  do offer great service. So just go to fractureme.com
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:21.760]  and remember the code TALKSHOW10 when you check
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:25.920]  out and you will save 10%. Well, we should wrap
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.920]  up. We've been talking for a while. Anything else?
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.680]  What else is on the agenda? Anything else you
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:31.600]  think that they're going to do at the event next
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:34.480]  week? I wonder if they're going to slip stream in
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.640]  maybe some kind of Wi-Fi update or cellular or
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.880]  something because I feel like the Wi-Fi equipment
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.560]  is getting pretty old. I think they sell a lot of
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:44.640]  it. And somebody has written about Wi-Fi a ton over
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.040]  the years. I'm like, they're kind of like two or
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:48.640]  three years behind some of the features in the
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.200]  marketplace. So I wonder, I wonder what they'll do.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.440]  Did you see the new thing? Walt Mossberg had a
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:55.600]  review of it. It's called the E-something and it's
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.200]  like a bunch of little pods that you put around
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.760]  your house to sort of create a network.
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:02.800]  Eero. I'm like, not so hip on it because I feel
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:06.400]  like it's, it's expensive. I saw a review of it
[02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:08.960]  where they're like, this is great. I had a $200
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:14.400]  airport, E-E-R-O. The thing after Eero Saarinen, I
[02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.680]  guess, the great Finnish architect. Eero Saarinen,
[02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.840]  a great answer if you're doing either trivial
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:23.760]  pursuit or crossword puzzles. E-E-R-O, Saarinen.
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:25.920]  He designed the dorm I lived in in college, which
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:28.400]  had no right angles. We hated it so much, so much
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:29.920]  you couldn't put anything up against the wall.
[02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:32.480]  God damn it, Eero Saarinen. And it's beautiful.
[02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:34.080]  He designed the Dulles Airport.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:35.040]  Oh, okay.
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.560]  I believe that's right. I'm saying that now. I
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:40.320]  don't know, but I think he's a famous architect.
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:41.920]  This has nothing to do with him. I hope they
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:45.120]  license the name. Yes, he designed it anyway. So
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:47.120]  Eero. Yeah. So there, so a review where someone
[02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:50.960]  said, well, I had a $200 or $180 Apple airport
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.480]  extreme and it didn't reach everywhere. So I
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.080]  bought three of these things and it was great on
[02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.480]  their $200 each. And I'm thinking that doesn't
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.480]  actually prove that they're better. Like you
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:00.720]  need to do this side by side. So I don't know. I
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:02.400]  think their notion is they're trying to make,
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:05.120]  uh, it's, you know, it's simpler, they're small,
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.520]  they're intrusive and they think they automatically
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:11.440]  pair over wifi. Um, so that's a nice idea compared
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:15.040]  to having to go into configure crap and airport
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:16.560]  utility. I mean, I've been writing about airport
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:19.360]  utility for like 12, 15, I don't know, since it came
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.840]  out in 2001 and it's never been a great idea.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.200]  It's never been a great piece of software. It's
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.760]  gotten better, but it's not, it's always done
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:27.440]  well. It's always done well compared to the
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.640]  competition, but it's correct. Yes. Yeah. I have
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.880]  a, I have a TP link Archer C seven, which is one
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.520]  of the top rated, um, routers from, you know, not
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:38.640]  from Google or Apple. Uh, and it's like 90 bucks
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:40.720]  and has 802.11 C and it's great. And their
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:43.600]  interface is dogs lunch. Like I love them, but
[02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:46.880]  there's like 40,000 options and it's, and it's
[02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:49.600]  like, there's no streamlined, like I want to do
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.800]  this thing. It's like, no, here, we're going to
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.400]  give you, we're going to throw every single thing
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.080]  we could put in the firmware at you. It's not
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:55.520]  great. That's not what people want. Right. A lot
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.680]  of them, it's almost like you're just opening a
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:03.440]  dot com file, right? Vomiting dot com. Yeah. Uh,
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.280]  so there's, I mean, but I love the idea. So the
[02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:07.680]  Euro is they're trying to get a very high profit
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.080]  margin in order to take all the pain away. And
[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.240]  there's, you know, there's market for that. Uh,
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:14.880]  you look at something like nest cam, nest cam is
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:16.720]  interesting because it's not, you know, it's
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:19.040]  premium in the market. It's not actually that much
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:22.240]  more expensive than many competitors that offer
[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:24.560]  similar features. It's a lot more competitive
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:26.640]  than the cheapo IP cameras that you have to do a
[02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:28.960]  ton of configuration for and don't have a cloud
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:31.440]  service. But nest cams was sold in, I think the
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.560]  millions at this point because you plug it in and
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.680]  you're done. Right. That's nice. I like that. I
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:40.000]  can't help but wonder that's, you've, you've put
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.640]  the idea in my head, you know, the wifi, the idea
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.240]  is I haven't heard anything like that, but it does
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.320]  seem like it might be overdue. And it's a
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.720]  technology that's constantly marched forward ever
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.120]  since introduction. And so therefore it seems like
[02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:56.480]  maybe it might be due. Um, and it would tie into
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:00.800]  maybe just the basic, uh, home kit, you know, who
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.880]  knows, maybe they have something, you know, I'm not
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.640]  trying to get anybody's hopes up, but maybe they
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.360]  have some other kind of home kit, you know, stuff
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.640]  you plug into your house, uh, stuff to announce
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:13.520]  just because it would be a good, it would be a good
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.000]  event to do it because it's not going to be, you
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.280]  know, it doesn't seem like it clearly it's out on
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:21.200]  campus. It's in their little town town hall. So
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:23.440]  it's not going to be a flagship event. There's no
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.360]  blockbuster that's going to be coming. Otherwise
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.000]  they'd held it in a bigger venue. Well, the fourth
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.960]  generation Apple TV, as I recollect, it has home kit
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:32.880]  hub features, right? It's got Bluetooth in it and
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:35.600]  whatever. And, uh, they haven't rolled that into
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:39.360]  the wifi devices. So, uh, I could see them doing
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.960]  the other thing they could do is do some kind of
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:43.040]  simple setup. Like you do when the Apple TV works,
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:45.040]  right. When that's worked, like hold your thing,
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:47.200]  hold your phone near the device. Now you can set
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:49.200]  it up. That's really cool. And when that worked
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.360]  for me with the Apple TV, I really liked it. I
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.600]  could see them adding Bluetooth, uh, when it
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.920]  worked, when it worked, I know I got it to work
[02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:58.560]  once. Uh, uh, I like my Apple TV a lot more now
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.200]  that I can use the remote app. Like I use, I use
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:03.680]  it a lot more, um, since they updated to support
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:06.560]  that. But, uh, wifi stuff is often slip streamed
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.160]  in, like they'll put in a press release and not
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:10.640]  announce it in a March or April event. I think the
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:13.120]  last few generations of real improvements. So,
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.120]  yeah, and it might make, it might make for
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:16.880]  something that they would, that they could demo.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.360]  Cause that's what I, that's what I kind of feel
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:22.000]  like they might be, you know, hit, hit up is, you
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.920]  know, just something that they can demo on stage
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.720]  to fill an hour.
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:28.480]  Yeah. And HomeKit has, I feel like HomeKit has
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:30.720]  been a very weak rollout. Like I think they
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.720]  expected to have more a year ago to offer. And,
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.880]  um, I don't know what the deal is. Like, I mean,
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:38.560]  it'd be, it's harder to corral a lot of third
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.880]  parties together and Apple didn't want to take
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:43.200]  center stage in making an ecosystem. They want
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:44.800]  to make the hubs, which makes sense, but it
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:47.520]  feels, uh, I mean, USB-C is only right now
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.680]  starting to hit the mainstream and Apple in that
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.440]  case too, did not take the center stage and
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:53.760]  build an ecosystem. They built stuff you could
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.520]  plug in or plug into. And, uh, I'm just already
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.120]  only now reviewing some USB-C docs for, uh,
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:03.280]  Mac world that do pass through power. And this
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:04.960]  is the first generation of those that have done
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.520]  those are just coming out now a year later. So
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:09.920]  I think Apple, I don't think it's ill advised.
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:11.200]  They shouldn't be focused. They shouldn't be
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:14.560]  building a USB-C, um, you know, extra devices
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.320]  and adapters and crap. They should be focused on
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.320]  the core thing. They shouldn't be building home
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.240]  sensors cause that's not, they should be putting
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.240]  the value in the right place, but I think they're
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.800]  seeing the penalty of the market, not leaping to
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.920]  their, um, to their needs. Yeah. I think it's the,
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.160]  the penalty of when they don't do it all
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.640]  themselves, you know, sometimes nothing happens.
[02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:34.400]  Cause it seems like, it just seems like homekit
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.880]  is one of those things that is now, I think all of
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.520]  us have kind of loosely filed it under, or we've
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:42.080]  at least started shifting it towards the whatever
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:45.680]  happened to pile, right? Yeah, whatever happened
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:47.760]  to homekit. Yeah, whatever happened to homekit.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:49.280]  You have these little bits and pieces that comes
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.600]  up, but there's nothing comprehensive. And I'm,
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:54.560]  you know, after bugs and nest cams and nest
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:57.760]  thermostats and other things like I, and some of
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.080]  the security things that are coming out, uh, the
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:01.840]  FTC putting action that, you know, they didn't
[02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:04.000]  order against a company that didn't properly
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.400]  secure its equipment. Strange how the FTC is,
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:09.760]  uh, giving penalties for not securing your
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:12.480]  devices against intrusion. Which brings us full
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:17.440]  circle. Exactly. Odd thing there. Uh, that's a
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.040]  pretty good guess. And that, you know, and I
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:20.480]  guess the other wild card would be if they come
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.360]  out with new Mac books of some sort. Yeah. It's
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:25.440]  been a year since the 12 inch Mac book. So it
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.520]  would be time, but I have one, I don't know. I,
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.680]  I love mine. I think I'm, I don't know if I'm one
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:32.400]  of the few, but I it's my favorite computer
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.040]  since my duo 210. I don't love the keyboard. I
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.920]  cope with the keyboard. Um, but I love my do 210.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:40.080]  And I think I love this one as much as that in
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:41.760]  between. I had a lot of bigger laptops. I didn't
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.480]  love quite as much titanium. I liked a lot, but
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.480]  well, I don't know. It seemed, it just seems to
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.360]  me like, and I know that I'm just not cute into
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:51.680]  Intel's roadmap. Like a lot of people are. And I
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:54.320]  know that a lot of it hangs on that, but it just
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:57.440]  seems like a device that you can kind of knock
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:01.360]  for being too slow. Whatever improvements Intel
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:05.520]  has has gotten in a year would be worth putting
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.920]  out a new revision of the product. It's true.
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:11.120]  Although I've laid out like a 1200 page book and
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.800]  InDesign on my Mac book, I've edit audio and
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:17.520]  audition Adobe audition with multiple tracks. It
[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:19.760]  can't do real time effects, but it lets me edit at
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:21.520]  least and play back in real time without applying
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.840]  all the effects. And, and I liked the dense screen.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:26.160]  I wanted to replace my air, which was underpowered
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:28.160]  and didn't have a retina. And I want, and this is
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.680]  the closest thing I could get that was like
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:31.920]  affordable and, and met it. And a year later, I'm
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.120]  still pretty delighted with it. Yeah.
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.320]  Ah, well, we'll know. I, uh, we'll be at the show.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.160]  I'm going to, I don't, who knows the famous last
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:43.920]  words, but I might try to do like a, uh, um, mini
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:47.360]  episode of the show, not live from the event, but
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.480]  maybe record something ad hoc with any, anybody
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:52.320]  else who's going to be there who, who will give
[02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.320]  me five or 10 minutes of their time, sort of a, do
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:56.880]  my thoughts and observations on the event right
[02:13:56.880 --> 02:13:58.960]  afterwards, Monday afternoon, there'll be a lot of
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.680]  people, you know, there I've been seeing, uh, uh,
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:03.600]  I'm not, I'm not going, I'm Seattle. I'll be
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:06.240]  covering it remotely for Mac world, but, uh, Susie
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:08.880]  Oaks will be there. And, uh, Mr. Jason style, I'm
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:11.040]  sure in Serenity Caldwell, I understand. So it'll
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.120]  be the old gang will be there in different guises.
[02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.240]  People who are readily volunteer will readily
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:18.400]  volunteer to be on a podcast. Exactly. Yeah. They
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.400]  don't know anything about this is a real stretch
[02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:23.200]  for you, Jason. Exactly. But would you, would you
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.440]  consider being on a podcast? He's only, he's
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:27.920]  only records, I think 15 a week now the poor guy.
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:31.600]  Yeah. I don't know if I'm exaggerating. I'm looking
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:34.000]  forward to it. I know it's not a blockbuster
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.760]  event, but I almost feel like these are the ones
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:37.200]  that are a little, they're more interesting
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:40.080]  strategically to me because the bigger ones are a
[02:14:40.080 --> 02:14:42.640]  little bit more obvious strategically. Yeah. This
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:45.840]  will be fun. I think I love that we don't know for
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:48.480]  sure as much, despite the leaks, the fact that
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:50.240]  there's just not as much, I mean, there's a lot of
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.360]  stuff known, but not seen. It's kind of interesting.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:56.800]  Yeah, totally. Uh, Glenn Fleischman, anybody who
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:59.520]  wants to see your work? How, I mean, you know,
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.560]  you're everywhere. You're at Mac world now. I've
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.920]  been ready. I read a lot for them. I, you know, I
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:06.240]  got a book on Slack that's coming out soon. We're
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:08.960]  syndicating it at Tidbits. They have a neat model
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.880]  where the first two chapters are up there now for
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:13.440]  free. If you go to tidbits.com about using Slack
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.040]  because you know, a lot of people, a lot of people,
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.280]  your age and mine, John, they've been told they
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:20.240]  have to use Slack. Now Slack's fun to use, but I
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:22.560]  keep coming across people like, okay, I got to use
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.240]  this new tool. How does it work? And like, all
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.160]  right. So the first book is about that. It could
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:28.080]  be the first two chapters. It'll be out in a few
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:30.560]  weeks, the full book, and then also a smaller
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.800]  compendium. Uh, you know, I got name checked, uh,
[02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:35.920]  at S South by Southwest. I wasn't there. People
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:37.840]  start telling me Stuart Butterfield's mentioning
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:39.440]  your name on stage. I'm like, what did I do?
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:43.280]  Like what did I know? I've known Stuart in passing
[02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.640]  for like 15 years. I'm like, what did I do? Just
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.040]  full circle very briefly. I'd mentioned in passing
[02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:51.200]  Roman Mars, the host of 99% invisible great
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.680]  podcast. He says something about the future of
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:56.400]  articles reporting on business will be, um, people
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:59.200]  posting Slack screen captures. Right. And I
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:01.280]  respond, Oh, well, you know, they'll just put
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:04.400]  steganographic, um, pixel identifiers. Slack will.
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:05.920]  So when you take a screen capture, it'll be able
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:09.440]  to identify it. And so Stuart on stage says, so
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:11.280]  something like Glenn Fleishman mentioned this,
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:12.480]  that we're not going to do this. It's like, Oh,
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:14.640]  thank God. But it was very funny. It's like, why
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:16.800]  am I being taught? What did I say? It's like, it's
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:18.960]  just saying that they will not be inserting a
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.560]  security, uh, identifier.
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:22.480]  I did not know you were writing a book on Slack.
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:25.760]  That is fantastic. It is a great idea. Uh, it's
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.480]  fun. I love it. It's, it's really great. Um, and
[02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:30.480]  I think it's well, five Slack teams. Yeah. So
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.640]  that's the, but people can read two chapters now.
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:34.400]  And then there's more, I'll have the book out in
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.160]  a few weeks, but, uh, yes. Find me at Mac world.
[02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.000]  Find me at tidbits.com and, um, and more to come.
[02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:44.400]  Uh, and of course at Twitter, uh, the very quiet
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.360]  seldomly updated, uh, at Glenn with two ends F
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:51.600]  account, I took two weeks off. It was a good
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:54.480]  break. I did. I had no tweeting for two weeks.
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:55.040]  It was really good.
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:56.800]  Was it hurt? Did it hurt?
[02:16:57.440 --> 02:16:59.040]  No, it was actually, it was good. It was good.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.760]  It's interesting. It's being on Twitter during
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.200]  the political season is very entertaining, but
[02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:05.520]  I kind of, you know, backed off a little from
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:07.760]  it. Now coming back, I'm enjoying it again.
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:14.320]  Glenn has, Glenn has 401,431 tweets. You took
[02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:16.320]  the break right at the 400,000 mark, right?
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:18.400]  I did. I essentially auctioned off the tweet
[02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.000]  to raise money for Planned Parenthood. And I
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.760]  raised, uh, I think people contributed almost
[02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:25.200]  $3,000 as, and someone got my 400,000th tweet
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:27.040]  as a result. So that was, that was my little
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:28.160]  taking a break.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.480]  I just know that right now there's a lot of
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.680]  people, we've been going a long time. It's a
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:32.960]  long show. People can tell it's over. They're
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:35.280]  like, Oh, come on. 400,000 tweets. This is when,
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.520]  you know, these guys are starved for oxygen and
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.680]  now Gruber's getting goofy and he's making shit
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:41.840]  up. And I'm telling you right now, if you go to
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.560]  Glenn's Twitter account, it's 401,000. I will
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.600]  leave the math of dividing the number of hours
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.520]  in a day and the number of years that Twitter
[02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:54.160]  is, has existed. I will leave that up to you.
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.080]  I'll leave it as an exercise to you. Fire up
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:59.600]  Peacock on your iPhone and, uh, and get Glenn's
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.840]  tweets per day output. He's probably tweet. I'll
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.440]  bet you've tweeted during the show. I'll bet if
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:05.440]  I look right now that you've tweeted while we
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:06.480]  recorded this show.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.880]  I'm withheld, but you know, I'm respectful of
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:15.840]  your time. Uh, I'm listening intently. Uh, Slack
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.520]  has driven, has taken some of my tweeting away
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:18.960]  because some of the people I used to communicate
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:21.680]  with a lot with on Twitter, we now have are in
[02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:24.000]  Slack rooms. So the incomparable work. It is
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.560]  absolutely. I understand the relay FM has a big
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.960]  chat room. There's a lot of the podcast networks
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:30.800]  because hosts on podcast networks all over the
[02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:33.680]  place. Uh, one thing I like about Slack, just for
[02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.520]  those listening to it's the fact that you can use
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:38.560]  it free with like up to 10,000 people and get most
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:41.200]  of the features is a really amazing freemium model.
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:44.560]  I think they have like, like 1.8 million of their
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:46.880]  users are daily users are in that mode and like
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:50.240]  600,000 are paying for service. So most of the
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:52.320]  Slack teams are under free and it's just nice to
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:55.040]  have a forum that's private where you can have
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.680]  these discussions. Well, I will make sure to get
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:00.320]  the link to the book, uh, in the show notes, but
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:02.000]  Glenn, thank you for your time. This is great.
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.320]  It's been a great pleasure, John. Thank you very
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:19.280]  much. Talk to you soon.
