[00:00.000 --> 00:04.320]  I've at least three episodes in a row where Skype has totally crept out at some point.
[00:04.320 --> 00:06.120]  So that sounds like Skype.
[00:06.120 --> 00:07.120]  Yeah.
[00:07.120 --> 00:08.120]  All right.
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.360]  So we'll just start the show.
[00:10.360 --> 00:11.360]  Yeah.
[00:11.360 --> 00:12.360]  So it's originally called well.
[00:12.360 --> 00:13.360]  First time on the show.
[00:13.360 --> 00:14.360]  Welcome.
[00:14.360 --> 00:15.360]  Thank you.
[00:15.360 --> 00:16.360]  I'm excited to be here.
[00:16.360 --> 00:17.360]  Busy times.
[00:17.360 --> 00:18.360]  Yes.
[00:18.360 --> 00:19.360]  Yes.
[00:19.360 --> 00:22.000]  Flying all over the place, looking at fancy technology.
[00:22.000 --> 00:27.000]  I'm going to, I was looking at my schedule and I'm like, I'm going to be in a different
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.520]  country and or state for the next like five weekends in a row, half of my job and half
[00:32.520 --> 00:34.320]  for like roller derby randomness.
[00:34.320 --> 00:36.760]  And it's just like, it's too much, too much traveling.
[00:36.760 --> 00:39.600]  I don't even have an Apple watch to keep track of it yet.
[00:39.600 --> 00:42.840]  It's bad when you start like when you have stretches like that and you start to get to
[00:42.840 --> 00:44.840]  know like certain TSA.
[00:44.840 --> 00:45.840]  Yeah.
[00:45.840 --> 00:46.840]  Yeah.
[00:46.840 --> 00:47.840]  Yeah.
[00:47.840 --> 00:48.840]  We're like, hey, yep.
[00:48.840 --> 00:49.840]  I'm here again.
[00:49.840 --> 00:53.160]  Like, you don't remember my name, but you know me and they're just like, yeah, yeah, go on
[00:53.160 --> 00:54.160]  through it.
[00:54.160 --> 00:55.160]  Exactly.
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.160]  It's like, OK.
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.000]  Boston, I fly Virgin pretty much anywhere and it's like, there's only, there's this like
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.840]  this one tiny little security terminal for Boston's Virgin area, like we have our own
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.880]  private security terminal, which is really awesome because it's like, all right, quick
[01:09.880 --> 01:14.840]  in and out, no problems, but it also means that yeah, there are like three TSA people
[01:14.840 --> 01:15.840]  total.
[01:15.840 --> 01:19.840]  So, so yeah, it's like maybe not by a name basis, but you get pretty familiar.
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.400]  Yeah, airports are so weird.
[01:21.400 --> 01:28.600]  We have like eight terminals, A, B, C, D, E and F here in Philly, but there's also like,
[01:28.600 --> 01:31.040]  I think it's like a one or something.
[01:31.040 --> 01:35.120]  There's like, there's like in between like A and B, there's like this little tiny thing
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.360]  and it's like certain US air flights go out of there.
[01:38.360 --> 01:41.120]  And when you go up, it is, it's like that.
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.400]  It's like literally like this security thing is like three TSA people and the funny thing
[01:45.400 --> 01:53.160]  is that they still divide it between TSA pre and not pre and there's never, it's, there's
[01:53.160 --> 01:54.320]  only three people there.
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.200]  It makes no difference, but yet somehow they put the, they put the lines in.
[01:58.200 --> 01:59.200]  People need their status.
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.560]  Yeah, the Virgin there's, you know, there's this silver and gold elevate line, which
[02:03.560 --> 02:07.960]  I think I've used maybe once in my life because the line has been long, but otherwise,
[02:07.960 --> 02:09.840]  yeah, it's like two people.
[02:09.840 --> 02:11.160]  That's negligible.
[02:11.160 --> 02:17.920]  So you were out in California last week for a watch song and pony show, what do they call
[02:17.920 --> 02:18.920]  a pony show?
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.920]  Something like that.
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.920]  Yeah.
[02:20.920 --> 02:21.920]  I like song and pony show.
[02:21.920 --> 02:22.920]  What's coming up?
[02:22.920 --> 02:23.920]  All right.
[02:23.920 --> 02:28.080]  So I got Toronto this weekend for roller derby tournament, then Ireland, I'm going over
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.960]  to Ull, which is going to be fun.
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.560]  It's my first time in Dublin and just in Ireland in general, other than like flying through.
[02:35.560 --> 02:36.880]  So I'm psyched for that.
[02:36.880 --> 02:39.280]  Insert me crying here because I'm a little.
[02:39.280 --> 02:40.280]  I know.
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.160]  Can we like Skype you in and have you still do your dinner?
[02:43.160 --> 02:45.600]  We're, we're, I don't know.
[02:45.600 --> 02:46.600]  I guess.
[02:46.600 --> 02:47.600]  Yeah.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.600]  Yeah.
[02:48.600 --> 02:50.600]  We're trying to figure out something.
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.600]  That's a bummer.
[02:51.600 --> 02:52.600]  But yeah.
[02:52.600 --> 02:53.600]  So it's that.
[02:53.600 --> 02:58.480]  And then I think I have a one, one sole weekend where I'm in Massachusetts.
[02:58.480 --> 03:04.040]  And then I'm out in California for the Yosemite conference and also to see my parents.
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.160]  And then potentially going to Oregon for another roller derby thing.
[03:08.160 --> 03:15.800]  So it's like, oh, wait, excuse me, Pittsburgh, then then Yosemite, then Oregon, it's a lot
[03:15.800 --> 03:16.800]  of stuff.
[03:16.800 --> 03:17.800]  All right.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.160]  And Yosemite is for the, um, the cocoa, yeah, cocoa, yeah, I'm really looking forward
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.160]  to that.
[03:24.160 --> 03:27.760]  I remember Davis pitching me on it a while back and I'm like, this sounds amazing.
[03:27.760 --> 03:32.760]  And it's like, why, why not do a, a conference about technology in Yosemite?
[03:32.760 --> 03:37.640]  Like that if, if Apple is going to go to the trouble of naming its OS updates after
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.640]  your fancy California locations, why not hold a conference there?
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.640]  It's gorgeous.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.640]  It makes me cry too.
[03:43.640 --> 03:47.400]  Cause that was also with that's also something I wanted to go to, something I was planning
[03:47.400 --> 03:48.400]  to go to.
[03:48.400 --> 03:54.440]  And also within the, uh, still can't fly, uh, Amtrak, John, do it, do an Amtrak blogging
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.440]  adventure.
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.440]  I looked into that.
[03:56.440 --> 03:57.440]  I looked into that.
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.200]  And Amtrak across the country is, or, like, it's clearly better to just drive.
[04:04.200 --> 04:05.200]  Yeah.
[04:05.200 --> 04:08.800]  It's a long experience that my, my buddy, Rich Stevens, who does, like, a webcomic
[04:08.800 --> 04:09.800]  he's to do that.
[04:09.800 --> 04:13.880]  I think the last two years that he went to San Diego Comic-Con, he did that from Western
[04:13.880 --> 04:14.880]  Mass.
[04:14.880 --> 04:15.880]  And he really liked it.
[04:15.880 --> 04:19.200]  Cause he's like, it's basically, you know, I don't have to go anywhere.
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.760]  And it's why five the entire time.
[04:20.760 --> 04:22.080]  And I don't have to worry about driving.
[04:22.080 --> 04:24.720]  And I don't have to worry about, like, staying in crappy motels.
[04:24.720 --> 04:26.680]  Cause I just have this, like, random bed.
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.920]  And then I get to go eat in big cities where they have, like, four hour layovers.
[04:30.920 --> 04:35.280]  So, but I, but I feel like you kind of have to, you need to be in a certain mindset to be
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.880]  like, yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to basically live on a plane or a train for nine days
[04:38.880 --> 04:41.200]  and be surrounded by other people constantly.
[04:41.200 --> 04:47.080]  I think the way to go is the way John Madden used to travel around the country.
[04:47.080 --> 04:48.080]  Do you remember this?
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.680]  John Madden, the football announcer, had a terrible fear of flying or just hated it.
[04:52.680 --> 04:54.400]  It just hated, hated flying.
[04:54.400 --> 04:58.720]  And so he had a, like, I don't know if it was, it was like a big bus.
[04:58.720 --> 05:02.520]  He just had a bus and had, you know, you know, a lot of money cause he was the top
[05:02.520 --> 05:03.520]  of course.
[05:03.520 --> 05:04.520]  Of course.
[05:04.520 --> 05:07.600]  So he just had like a crew and they just, he just drove his bus everywhere.
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.720]  You know, like maybe this Sunday's game is in New York, next Sunday's in Dallas and the
[05:11.720 --> 05:15.080]  next ones in San Francisco, they just, you know, after the game, they just get the bus
[05:15.080 --> 05:16.080]  and drive there.
[05:16.080 --> 05:17.080]  Oh man.
[05:17.080 --> 05:21.560]  And I'm sure it was a pimped out bus too, like, right, like with a kitchen and, yeah,
[05:21.560 --> 05:25.640]  hot tub in the back and like just, that sounds kind of amazing.
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.400]  But I feel like you need, you need a certain amount of lifestyle and money for, you know,
[05:30.400 --> 05:32.160]  $10,000 Apple watches and things like that.
[05:32.160 --> 05:33.160]  Right.
[05:33.160 --> 05:37.600]  And I don't think it's worth a short term investment for a six to eight year, I enjoy.
[05:37.600 --> 05:41.960]  But now that would be like a good feature that maybe Uber could look into that and like
[05:41.960 --> 05:44.400]  a temporary rock star tour.
[05:44.400 --> 05:45.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:45.640 --> 05:47.640]  Bus John Gruber around the country.
[05:47.640 --> 05:48.640]  Right.
[05:48.640 --> 05:51.520]  But you could, you could do a Patreon, a kickstarter, one of those.
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.240]  Get me to, get me to USM it, but still wouldn't get me to Ireland, but get me to USM
[05:55.240 --> 05:56.240]  too.
[05:56.240 --> 05:57.240]  You don't want to go on a boat.
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.240]  But what's your scary?
[05:58.240 --> 05:59.240]  Well, you know what?
[05:59.240 --> 06:00.920]  It's funny because we looked into it.
[06:00.920 --> 06:04.560]  I forget if I mentioned this on the show before, but we at least looked into, you know,
[06:04.560 --> 06:05.560]  it seemed ridiculous.
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.440]  I mean, I mean, and I've got my kid here at school, I can't, you know, I don't want to
[06:09.440 --> 06:10.440]  be away for weeks.
[06:10.440 --> 06:15.000]  But it, even then, it was hard because wool is too close to winter.
[06:15.000 --> 06:20.720]  So like, there aren't any, um, any real cross, uh, cross Atlantic voyages.
[06:20.720 --> 06:24.520]  Well, there are, but only they only go to, uh, Great Britain.
[06:24.520 --> 06:28.960]  Oh, it's funny because when you're flying, if you're flying to Ireland, it's like, if
[06:28.960 --> 06:37.480]  you're itinerary is like Boston to, um, London, what's the big one in London, um, Heathrow?
[06:37.480 --> 06:38.480]  Heathrow, yeah.
[06:38.480 --> 06:41.520]  And then he throw to Dublin, you don't think twice about it.
[06:41.520 --> 06:44.600]  You know, you know, that there's a good chance you're not going to get a direct flight and
[06:44.600 --> 06:45.880]  you don't think twice about the fact.
[06:45.880 --> 06:51.520]  But if, if you can't get in a plane, the fact that Ireland and England are not the same
[06:51.520 --> 06:53.800]  island, it makes all the difference in the world.
[06:53.800 --> 06:54.800]  Yeah.
[06:54.800 --> 06:55.800]  It would have been terrible.
[06:55.800 --> 06:56.800]  It would not terrible.
[06:56.800 --> 07:00.680]  But it's like, like you take like a Caribbean cruise and it's like you lay out in a deck
[07:00.680 --> 07:01.680]  and it's great.
[07:01.680 --> 07:05.760]  You take, you know, like the Queen Elizabeth to England and late March and it's, you
[07:05.760 --> 07:07.600]  know, you don't go outside.
[07:07.600 --> 07:12.160]  No, you hide in your cabin and you pray that you don't hit icebergs.
[07:12.160 --> 07:19.440]  So no, it's probably, sorry, we'll get you like a, a roving, um, what the, the iPad robots
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.520]  that just kind of glide around and like pop into the rooms just float, float your Twitter
[07:24.520 --> 07:25.520]  avatar.
[07:25.520 --> 07:26.520]  Yeah.
[07:26.520 --> 07:33.200]  It's like, it's like a iPad on a little, what's that scooter called, like a segue, a segue.
[07:33.200 --> 07:34.200]  Yeah.
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.200]  Yeah.
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.200]  I know there's an official name for it.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.200]  Actually, it's funny.
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.640]  One of my former Macworld co-workers, Roman Loyola, reviewed one of these things for Macworld.
[07:42.640 --> 07:47.680]  And I feel it was something like two months after he reviewed it, um, he in it, like
[07:47.680 --> 07:52.720]  accidentally ended up on the Colbert show because they used our clip of like the crazy
[07:52.720 --> 07:54.680]  iPad segue robot.
[07:54.680 --> 08:01.400]  So now he's forever like, he's infamously known as like the Colbert iPad robot guy, just
[08:01.400 --> 08:05.400]  like he's gotten recognized as that and it cracks me up.
[08:05.400 --> 08:14.200]  Uh, so, uh, let's revisit last week because I feel like everybody's still, it's funny.
[08:14.200 --> 08:19.440]  I think now a week later, people are more upset about the Mac book part of the announcement
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.840]  than Apple Watch.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  Yeah.
[08:21.840 --> 08:27.120]  I feel like, you know, I was kind of expecting a lot of hoop law over the $10,000 to $17,000 gold
[08:27.120 --> 08:28.120]  watch.
[08:28.120 --> 08:34.000]  And instead, it's everybody throwing their hands up and uproar one part on a Mac book.
[08:34.000 --> 08:35.000]  How could you?
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.640]  And I'm like, do you remember in 2008 when, uh, when they pulled a computer out of a
[08:41.640 --> 08:47.080]  Manila envelope and it only had two USB ports and, uh, had no, no CD drive and everybody,
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.440]  you know, like, I feel like this is the exact same argument just four or five years later.
[08:51.440 --> 08:52.440]  Yeah.
[08:52.440 --> 08:53.440]  I remember that event.
[08:53.440 --> 08:57.200]  I can't remember if it was WWDC or Mac world.
[08:57.200 --> 08:58.200]  Maybe it was about the Mac world.
[08:58.200 --> 09:02.120]  I think it was Mac world because I remember I wasn't working in the tech industry at
[09:02.120 --> 09:06.680]  the time, but I, I seem to remember pictures of like that Mac book air is hanging on strings.
[09:06.680 --> 09:07.680]  Yeah.
[09:07.680 --> 09:08.680]  Yeah.
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.760]  Remember before the keynote, the banners said there's something in the air.
[09:14.760 --> 09:19.840]  And for some reason, it's like the rumor, the, the, the 48 hour, you know, there's like
[09:19.840 --> 09:26.040]  that, that like once certain signs start going up at, at your bubuela or in this case,
[09:26.040 --> 09:28.480]  it was a Boscone West.
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.280]  Then the rumors reach a fever pitch because people start trying to read into what it is
[09:33.280 --> 09:34.440]  that Apple has shown.
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.160]  Whereas anybody with any common sense would know that whatever they're showing you that's
[09:38.160 --> 09:41.560]  not covered up is, is not going to give it away.
[09:41.560 --> 09:42.560]  Oh, no.
[09:42.560 --> 09:45.760]  And if anything, they're outright teasing you because they know you're going to try and
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.880]  criminal analogy get to death.
[09:47.880 --> 09:48.880]  Right.
[09:48.880 --> 09:52.920]  And I remember that the rumor, I remember this, I usually, the years blurred together
[09:52.920 --> 09:58.960]  to me, but I remember this very distinctly was that the rumor was that air was the name
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.600]  of Apple's in house flash killer.
[10:02.600 --> 10:04.960]  Oh, I remember that.
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.200]  It would be called air and it was going to be, and I remember saying, I don't think so
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.480]  because if it was, they wouldn't put the name of it on the banner and be, I really think
[10:13.480 --> 10:17.720]  they mean it that they, that they, it's not just flashing, but they don't, they don't
[10:17.720 --> 10:22.000]  want a proprietary binary blob thing on the web.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.080]  Like they really do mean that they think HTML5 is the way forward for the web.
[10:27.080 --> 10:29.920]  Like I really think this is wrong.
[10:29.920 --> 10:33.080]  And then people were upset when they ended up being a notebook.
[10:33.080 --> 10:36.360]  They were like, well, what happened to the flash killer?
[10:36.360 --> 10:39.160]  And it was like, they never said they were going to do a flash killer.
[10:39.160 --> 10:44.120]  No, you, you, you whipped it up from thin air, surprise.
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.320]  I was promised a flash killer.
[10:46.320 --> 10:47.320]  You were promised nothing.
[10:47.320 --> 10:48.320]  Right.
[10:48.320 --> 10:50.120]  Play with your shiny new Macbook air.
[10:50.120 --> 10:58.560]  Yeah, but the parallels to, to, to that device, the first Macbook air, I, it's almost
[10:58.560 --> 10:59.560]  exact.
[10:59.560 --> 11:02.920]  Other than the fact that they didn't pull it out of a mineral envelope, it's
[11:02.920 --> 11:05.160]  pretty much exact same scenario.
[11:05.160 --> 11:06.320]  Oh, absolutely.
[11:06.320 --> 11:10.240]  I mean, it's, you have something that was like the 2000 Macbook air.
[11:10.240 --> 11:13.560]  I was working at an Apple store at the time.
[11:13.560 --> 11:20.600]  And I mean, it was underpowered to expensive and not really designed for, not really
[11:20.600 --> 11:23.160]  designed for the general public at that point.
[11:23.160 --> 11:24.840]  And everybody just kind of poo-pooed it.
[11:24.840 --> 11:28.040]  We're like, oh, this, you know, this computer is ridiculous.
[11:28.040 --> 11:29.560]  How do they expect us to use it?
[11:29.560 --> 11:31.080]  It's thin and that's cool.
[11:31.080 --> 11:34.400]  But it's an impractical blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.520]  And now, you know, a couple years later, the entire laptop line is based off of the, uh,
[11:40.520 --> 11:45.200]  the innovations and the creations that originated from that 2008 Macbook air.
[11:45.200 --> 11:46.960]  Here's, here's where my memory gets fuzzy.
[11:46.960 --> 11:53.880]  I know that the base model still had a spinning hard drive, but was there an SSD option?
[11:53.880 --> 11:54.880]  I believe.
[11:54.880 --> 11:57.400]  Yeah, there was an SSD option, but it was expensive.
[11:57.400 --> 12:00.280]  And it was like 64 meg, or 64 gigs.
[12:00.280 --> 12:02.480]  Yeah, I, maybe it was 128.
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.520]  I can't remember now.
[12:03.520 --> 12:09.440]  I'm like, I, I sold, I think four of these in the, um, in the like two years I was working
[12:09.440 --> 12:10.440]  at the store.
[12:10.440 --> 12:12.520]  And granted, I wasn't on the floor a whole lot selling things.
[12:12.520 --> 12:17.720]  Like I was like, I taught classes most of the time, but even so, it was like the only time
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.320]  that you got to get a Macbook air out from like the back of how storage was when like
[12:22.320 --> 12:27.120]  somebody in a fancy suit came in who was like, oh, I just need a, I need a third laptop
[12:27.120 --> 12:28.120]  for travel.
[12:28.120 --> 12:32.640]  Like it was definitely a high end business man's like, I'm sitting on a plane for a long
[12:32.640 --> 12:33.640]  two period of time.
[12:33.640 --> 12:37.400]  And I want to work on like a super light computer sort of thing.
[12:37.400 --> 12:39.200]  It was wicked expensive.
[12:39.200 --> 12:46.960]  Here's, here it is, uh, Jackie Cheng had an article on it for ours, uh, back in February
[12:46.960 --> 12:47.960]  2008.
[12:47.960 --> 12:49.920]  I'm copying this URL right now.
[12:49.920 --> 12:53.160]  The famous last words on the show is I say it's going to be in the show notes and then
[12:53.160 --> 12:59.000]  I forget to put it in the show notes, um, but I've got it my BB at a file right now.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.040]  It cost 1300 extra and it was 64 gigabytes.
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.200]  Oh my God.
[13:04.200 --> 13:11.400]  So the high end air in, in early 2008 was, all right.
[13:11.400 --> 13:18.400]  So the regular one Macbook air with a hard drive, 1.6 gigahertz into a core to do.
[13:18.400 --> 13:19.400]  Yep.
[13:19.400 --> 13:21.800]  Both of them only had two gigs of RAM.
[13:21.800 --> 13:22.800]  Oh, yeah.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.800]  Yeah.
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.840]  The other, the spinning hard just one only had an 80 gig hard drive, an 80 gig, four,
[13:27.840 --> 13:30.120]  420 RPM hard drive.
[13:30.120 --> 13:35.880]  And then the 64 gigabyte solid state drive was an extra $13 dollars.
[13:35.880 --> 13:42.720]  So in other words, the cost of the entire new Macbook, exactly the same price, like for,
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.640]  for an entirely new Macbook, it was what it cost to upgrade to the SSD.
[13:47.640 --> 13:52.720]  So I guess that was like $3,100, I think it was a big price, wasn't it, 1800?
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.480]  So I want to say it was $17 or $1800, I'm trying to pull this, let's see, I'm trying to
[13:58.480 --> 14:05.120]  pull this up somewhere, of course, I'm looking at an old Macbook review and of course
[14:05.120 --> 14:11.680]  we don't have the price anywhere, it's helpful, that's it from now on, I'm just making
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.440]  articles that have prices, no, it's, but it was pretty, here we go, yeah, $17.99 was the
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.160]  base configuration.
[14:19.160 --> 14:22.440]  So it was $3,100 to get it with an SSD.
[14:22.440 --> 14:28.960]  And truth be told, you really weren't getting the Macbook air experience without an SSD.
[14:28.960 --> 14:29.960]  Oh no.
[14:29.960 --> 14:31.400]  And it's clear they came out with it.
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.640]  And the reason they had the one with the hard drive was because SSDs were so insanely expensive
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.640]  in 2008.
[14:36.640 --> 14:37.640]  Yeah.
[14:37.640 --> 14:41.600]  And 2008, that they really did not want to have the base model be $3,100, it just, the
[14:41.600 --> 14:47.720]  optics would just be bad, but that really was the one to get to, to get the experience.
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.800]  If that was clearly where they were going, and I think it was within a year, they dropped
[14:52.800 --> 14:53.800]  the hard drives.
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.800]  Oh, yeah.
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.960]  Well, I remember the 2010 Macbook Airs, and that was the first Macbook Air I owned when
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.200]  they came out with the 11-inch and the 13-inch, and all of a sudden, not only were the
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.560]  Macbook Airs affordable, but they were in super tiny, you know, core, or a Powerbook Duo
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.560]  style builds, and I was like, all right, I can, I can deal with two USB ports if it, you
[15:16.560 --> 15:19.680]  know, if it comes in an 11-inch size, sure.
[15:19.680 --> 15:21.800]  I remember, I remember, I think it was Will Shipley.
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.440]  I think he had the first air, I think, and he, but he had the SSD one, and he was doing,
[15:26.440 --> 15:29.760]  you know, software development on it, which sounds crazy because, like you said, it was
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.080]  overall in grand scheme of things, an underpowered device, but I remember him right, and
[15:35.080 --> 15:38.720]  if it wasn't the first gen one, he had a very early one in the very early days when
[15:38.720 --> 15:44.200]  they were relatively expensive and relatively slow in terms of CPU performance.
[15:44.200 --> 15:49.440]  And he raved about it because the SSD was so great at, like, when you're compiling stuff
[15:49.440 --> 15:54.120]  with Xcode, you're touching lots and lots, hundreds of little files very quickly, and that's
[15:54.120 --> 15:59.880]  where an SSD blows a spinning hard drive away, is touching lots of, lots of little files
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.440]  in, right, one after another after another.
[16:02.440 --> 16:06.480]  And so for compiling stuff in Xcode, he, he, I remember him writing about it, he was like,
[16:06.480 --> 16:11.400]  this is a fantastic machine, I cannot wait for the future when everything is SSD.
[16:11.400 --> 16:16.240]  So there were definitely people who loved it, and it was there, but it's, you know, it was
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.240]  ahead of its time.
[16:17.240 --> 16:18.240]  Oh, yeah.
[16:18.240 --> 16:21.360]  Do you remember the first computer you had that hasn't had an SSD in it, because I know
[16:21.360 --> 16:23.480]  for me it was, it was life changing.
[16:23.480 --> 16:24.480]  Yeah.
[16:24.480 --> 16:34.000]  It was, my, a 15 inch MacBook Pro, or no, no, maybe it wasn't a MacBook Pro, I mean, I was
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  going to say a power book.
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.240]  It was a MacBook Pro, 15 inch MacBook Pro, that didn't ship with an SSD.
[16:41.240 --> 16:46.920]  I bought it, that's actually the last time I ever upgraded a Mac after I bought it too.
[16:46.920 --> 16:54.600]  But I bought like an OWC upgrade package, and it was like getting a new machine.
[16:54.600 --> 16:59.200]  I got, it did it like two years after I bought it, and it really did, you know, I don't
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.640]  know what it cost me, maybe like $800, and it felt like I just got a new $2,000 MacBook
[17:03.640 --> 17:04.640]  Pro.
[17:04.640 --> 17:05.640]  It was crazy.
[17:05.640 --> 17:11.040]  Like I actually, I did the same thing after I bought my, my 2010 MacBook Air, and
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.440]  I, you know, going from, I had a 15 inch MacBook Pro that was running on a spinning
[17:16.440 --> 17:17.440]  disk.
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.360]  And once I got the air, it was, it was like night and day where it's like the Pro.
[17:21.360 --> 17:26.920]  The Pro, despite being, I think, three or four times as powerful as the air, felt like
[17:26.920 --> 17:30.920]  it was, you know, running in molasses, and I was just like, ah, screw this computer, I'm
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.400]  just going to use the air for full time, you know, doing everything.
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.200]  And when I started doing video development, I was like, all right, you know what, maybe
[17:38.200 --> 17:42.920]  I need to consider, can I put an SSD in the Pro?
[17:42.920 --> 17:45.800]  And then when I did, it was exactly how you described.
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.960]  It's like, it, it turns the machine upside down into a brand new device.
[17:49.960 --> 17:53.960]  Like it, it doesn't, it doesn't feel like you're working on a tooth or three year old
[17:53.960 --> 17:58.560]  computer anymore, despite the fact that the internals might be, you know, severely outdated.
[17:58.560 --> 17:59.560]  Yeah.
[17:59.560 --> 18:04.040]  And it's like, and every, you know, I probably everybody listening is, I mean, I wonder
[18:04.040 --> 18:06.240]  what percentage of people are on SSDs now.
[18:06.240 --> 18:11.680]  Yeah, well, I think, well, most of the laptops now have SSD standard, but it's that, it's
[18:11.680 --> 18:14.880]  the IMAX that are still a little tricky.
[18:14.880 --> 18:19.200]  I, we were talking about this before the show, where my, my IMAX is fixing out right now
[18:19.200 --> 18:24.240]  because I think the, the hard drive is slowly dying and it's a, it's a normal spinning,
[18:24.240 --> 18:26.160]  spinning splatter.
[18:26.160 --> 18:30.480]  And I didn't even realize that when I, when I got the computer, I thought that it would,
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.960]  it came with an SSD standard.
[18:31.960 --> 18:34.800]  Of course, I had my company, you know, the company ordered it for me.
[18:34.800 --> 18:37.560]  And I was just kind of like, everything comes with SSDs now.
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.640]  It's, it's 20, you know, 2012, 2013, like, that's, that's no question.
[18:42.640 --> 18:47.040]  And then at some point, I'm like, man, this IMAX is really slow compared to my, you know,
[18:47.040 --> 18:51.640]  my tiny little laptop, and I finally realized, oh, it has a hard drive in it.
[18:51.640 --> 18:56.880]  So I feel like people who have the desktop computers may not like the standard configuration
[18:56.880 --> 19:02.440]  for an IMAX is, I believe, a big hard drive and like, yeah, terabyte hard drive is really
[19:02.440 --> 19:03.440]  tempting.
[19:03.440 --> 19:06.320]  But good, like, you don't need a terabyte space.
[19:06.320 --> 19:11.160]  I'm just looking now, this, this standard config for every IMAX is a hard drive, except
[19:11.160 --> 19:17.920]  the retina 5K IMAX, which still is a fusion drive, which is the, the, you know, the crazy,
[19:17.920 --> 19:22.640]  it looks like one volume, but it's an SSD and a hard drive combined, right.
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.200]  Which is a really good, uh, at fascinating technology and really cool.
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.840]  And it seems, you know, a couple of years in, it seems like it works really well in practice.
[19:32.840 --> 19:33.840]  Oh, yeah.
[19:33.840 --> 19:38.960]  Well, I'm, there are so, I know a couple of people in the PC building, uh, industry and
[19:38.960 --> 19:43.360]  like, that's, that's been really popular for a while, putting in an SSD and a big hard
[19:43.360 --> 19:44.360]  drive.
[19:44.360 --> 19:48.920]  But with the PC market, it was put the boot drive on the SSD and then all the other files
[19:48.920 --> 19:54.160]  on the hard drive and the fusion drive, as far as I understand it, um, it all happens under
[19:54.160 --> 19:56.160]  the hood and it, and it's seamless.
[19:56.160 --> 20:00.880]  So not only is the boot drive on the SSD, but any files that you're currently working
[20:00.880 --> 20:05.920]  on, get pulled over magically to the SSD and theoretically you shouldn't notice it.
[20:05.920 --> 20:11.220]  So you're never, you never really should be drawing any files, uh, actively off of the hard
[20:11.220 --> 20:12.220]  drive.
[20:12.220 --> 20:15.400]  It's just where, you know, inactive files live kind of like old school memory.
[20:15.400 --> 20:17.400]  And I'm like, that's, that's really cool.
[20:17.400 --> 20:19.720]  That's a, like, that's a great piece of technology.
[20:19.720 --> 20:20.720]  Yeah.
[20:20.720 --> 20:22.720]  But it still doesn't save you from the lack of reliability.
[20:22.720 --> 20:23.720]  Oh, no.
[20:23.720 --> 20:27.120]  You know, and it performance stuff, you're eventually, you know, depending on what you do,
[20:27.120 --> 20:31.440]  the performance eventually, but eventually you suffer and, and you get the performance
[20:31.440 --> 20:35.720]  of a spinning hard disk, depending on what you're doing, you know, yeah, exactly all,
[20:35.720 --> 20:37.400]  all hard drives eventually die.
[20:37.400 --> 20:38.400]  Right.
[20:38.400 --> 20:43.600]  Importing a bunch of file or photos into high photo or exporting them out or something like
[20:43.600 --> 20:46.800]  the, anything like that where you're looking at, you know, you're going to, you know,
[20:46.800 --> 20:53.200]  looking at a gig or two of data, it's, you know, you're clearly can't make, you know, can't
[20:53.200 --> 20:56.760]  put 50 pounds of data in a, no, it is.
[20:56.760 --> 21:00.680]  You can only hold so much before it has to, to look to the heavyweight, even if the heavyweight
[21:00.680 --> 21:03.160]  is, you know, has a speed of one.
[21:03.160 --> 21:04.160]  All right.
[21:04.160 --> 21:06.840]  But I'll, yeah, right though, all the, all the notebooks now are SSD.
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.280]  I mean, I guess you can still get like, if you cheap out and get the cheap MacBook
[21:11.280 --> 21:17.320]  Pros, they still come with hard disks, the retina ones all are SSD and the errors are
[21:17.320 --> 21:18.320]  all SSD.
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.320]  Yeah.
[21:19.320 --> 21:23.080]  Is that, I haven't actually looked at the, the store configurations since last week event.
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.960]  Is the, does the 13 inch non retina MacBook Pro still exist?
[21:27.960 --> 21:31.960]  Is that still a configuration or did the, the new MacBook officially just tell it?
[21:31.960 --> 21:40.200]  It's still, it still is their MacBook Pro 13 inch 2.5 gigahertz, it's only 1099.
[21:40.200 --> 21:45.080]  But it's a 500 gigabyte, 5400 RPM hard drive and four gigs of RAM.
[21:45.080 --> 21:49.800]  I'm honestly, I'm, that's to me a sort of a baffling configuration to me.
[21:49.800 --> 21:51.760]  I can't see why anyone would buy that.
[21:51.760 --> 21:57.320]  If you're, if, if your price is 1099 and you're really kind of price sensitive and you
[21:57.320 --> 22:02.560]  don't want that $1,300 retino one, I really can't see why you don't just get the air.
[22:02.560 --> 22:03.560]  Yeah.
[22:03.560 --> 22:09.480]  I suspect that that configuration must solely exist for education, maybe, um, with the
[22:09.480 --> 22:14.640]  idea of like education folks who want to do video editing or something like that.
[22:14.640 --> 22:18.680]  But even then, like, the errors are pretty good for video editing at this point.
[22:18.680 --> 22:25.200]  Like the, the core i7s that they, they have available like, I, I routinely use my 11 inch
[22:25.200 --> 22:32.560]  for, for a lot of video video intensive stuff that I'm probably not supposed to.
[22:32.560 --> 22:34.680]  But it's definitely like it's functional.
[22:34.680 --> 22:37.160]  It's not, you know, it's, I don't know.
[22:37.160 --> 22:42.680]  My son and I went into the Apple store just the other day because, um, I figured we had a,
[22:42.680 --> 22:47.960]  he had a weird issue with his, his MacBook Pro, um, that we couldn't fix at home.
[22:47.960 --> 22:53.600]  And it ended up the genius just needed to, um, you remember the SMC reset system memory
[22:53.600 --> 22:55.480]  controller and the old way to do it.
[22:55.480 --> 23:00.160]  And the old days was you do take the battery out or if it was a desktop, you'd unplug
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.160]  it.
[23:01.160 --> 23:04.280]  Um, doesn't work so well with, no, and there's a keyboard shortcut.
[23:04.280 --> 23:10.480]  You hold down shift option control, I think, on the left side of the keyboard shift option
[23:10.480 --> 23:13.520]  control, not command and restart.
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.880]  And then the, if you have it plugged in, you know that it did the SMC reset because the
[23:17.880 --> 23:25.960]  color will change on the, uh, uh, uh, mag safe from like green to orange or orange to green.
[23:25.960 --> 23:26.960]  But it didn't solve it for him.
[23:26.960 --> 23:29.880]  It just wouldn't turn on the screen wouldn't turn on.
[23:29.880 --> 23:34.040]  Um, so I thought it was bad news like, uh, God's, you know, it's going to need to be
[23:34.040 --> 23:35.040]  replaced.
[23:35.040 --> 23:36.040]  It's under warranty.
[23:36.040 --> 23:37.040]  It's relatively new.
[23:37.040 --> 23:40.560]  Um, but ended up, he just needed to take it back in their secret lab and take the battery
[23:40.560 --> 23:41.560]  out.
[23:41.560 --> 23:42.560]  And then it just started right up.
[23:42.560 --> 23:46.400]  Um, so anyway, you know, all wouldn't well with that.
[23:46.400 --> 23:51.360]  Um, but while we were there, I was like, we got to try out this new force touch trackpad.
[23:51.360 --> 23:54.120]  And we went over to the table with the 13 inch MacBook pros.
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.800]  And the first one we went to was the, the low end one that doesn't have the new trackpad
[23:58.800 --> 24:00.360]  and doesn't even have a retina screen.
[24:00.360 --> 24:02.000]  And we were both like, oh, gross.
[24:02.000 --> 24:03.840]  I was so proud of him.
[24:03.840 --> 24:07.000]  He was set to post out by the, the non retina screen.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.000]  Yeah.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  Who would buy this?
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.720]  It really is, uh, starkly different once you get used to the retina.
[24:12.720 --> 24:18.600]  Um, I remember having a conversation, I want to say the year before we got the iPhone
[24:18.600 --> 24:23.160]  four, I want to say, um, where I was talking with a friend of mine and he's like, I just
[24:23.160 --> 24:25.880]  don't understand why Apple just doesn't do retina screens.
[24:25.880 --> 24:28.360]  Like they didn't, we didn't call them retina at that point, but I, I don't understand
[24:28.360 --> 24:34.480]  why, uh, Apple doesn't do high DPI screens because they have the technology and text looks
[24:34.480 --> 24:35.480]  terrible.
[24:35.480 --> 24:39.640]  And as a designer, I want to see things clearly and that's the next generation of technology.
[24:39.640 --> 24:44.320]  And like two weeks after we have this conversation, the new iPhone comes out and he was like
[24:44.320 --> 24:45.320]  a kid at Christmas.
[24:45.320 --> 24:47.000]  He was just like, oh my God.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.320]  I can't wait until I have this in my eye Mac, it's, it's, it really is, you know, it's
[24:51.320 --> 24:52.320]  stark.
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.920]  It's, it's one of the few things that I'm sorely kind of missing on my Mac book air right
[24:55.920 --> 24:56.920]  now.
[24:56.920 --> 25:01.600]  I don't, I don't know if the new MacBook is currently enough for me that I would swap over,
[25:01.600 --> 25:02.600]  but it's definitely tempting.
[25:02.600 --> 25:03.600]  Yeah.
[25:03.600 --> 25:04.600]  Just for random.
[25:04.600 --> 25:05.600]  Yeah.
[25:05.600 --> 25:06.600]  But force touch.
[25:06.600 --> 25:07.600]  Oh my God.
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.600]  All right.
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.440]  Let me, let me, let me take a break down and do the first sponsor, um, let's do our
[25:12.440 --> 25:15.560]  good friends at Squarespace, you know, uh, Squarespace.
[25:15.560 --> 25:16.560]  That's where you go.
[25:16.560 --> 25:18.960]  If you have, you need to make a website, go to Squarespace.
[25:18.960 --> 25:19.960]  They do everything.
[25:19.960 --> 25:21.440]  You can register domains.
[25:21.440 --> 25:28.000]  You get templates to start from and you can build any type of website with Squarespace.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.520]  You want to build an online store.
[25:29.520 --> 25:30.520]  You can build an online store.
[25:30.520 --> 25:31.960]  They already have that as a component.
[25:31.960 --> 25:33.880]  They already handle all the commerce.
[25:33.880 --> 25:38.280]  They handle the credit card processing, all the security, making sure everything goes through
[25:38.280 --> 25:44.080]  SSL instead of unencrypted over everything like that is just built into everybody's
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.640]  Squarespace account.
[25:45.640 --> 25:51.600]  Um, all their templates are responsive.
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.880]  Everything looks great from a four inch phone to a 27 inch, five case, cinema display,
[25:57.880 --> 25:59.960]  iMac.
[25:59.960 --> 26:04.920]  Um, and you can get started free of charge.
[26:04.920 --> 26:05.920]  You get a whole month.
[26:05.920 --> 26:10.880]  Go there, sign up, start using it and your website fully functional, no limits for a full
[26:10.880 --> 26:13.000]  month before you have to pay a nickel.
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.840]  Uh, it's a tremendous deal and plans start at a ridiculous eight bucks a month.
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.520]  It's ridiculous that you get all this free bucks a month.
[26:22.520 --> 26:27.600]  Um, they have a new, um, back end.
[26:27.600 --> 26:29.080]  They call it Squarespace seven.
[26:29.080 --> 26:32.280]  You can find out all the new features because it's Squarespace has been sponsored in
[26:32.280 --> 26:33.280]  podcasts for years.
[26:33.280 --> 26:37.200]  You know, you've heard of them, you've, and everybody listening this is heard of them.
[26:37.200 --> 26:43.760]  You want to find out what's new that you go to squarespace.com slash seven, SEV and spell
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.040]  it out like the, uh, like the David Fincher movie, uh, and they've got a great, great site
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.760]  that explains all the new stuff.
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.920]  I could go on for minutes and minutes and minutes with all the new stuff, um, but the biggest
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.160]  thing, the fundamental thing that they've really emphasized in Squarespace seven is making
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.160]  everything visual.
[27:02.160 --> 27:03.320]  They've always been graphical.
[27:03.320 --> 27:08.040]  It's always been a great platform for non technical people to set up their own website.
[27:08.040 --> 27:11.000]  But now it's so wizzy wig.
[27:11.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's ridiculous.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.120]  It's the, the wizzy wig web editor that people have been looking for for 20 years,
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.080]  like what you see when you're logged into your Squarespace account, if you want to move
[27:20.080 --> 27:23.320]  something from the left to the right, you just move it from the left to the right and
[27:23.320 --> 27:27.200]  then boom, it save it and it's moved from the left to the right for everybody who visits
[27:27.200 --> 27:28.520]  your website.
[27:28.520 --> 27:35.440]  It could not be more obvious and visual, um, so go there, check it out.
[27:35.440 --> 27:41.080]  Check out the new features in Squarespace seven and go to, if you want to go, uh, just
[27:41.080 --> 27:46.320]  to start and then know that you came from the show, go to squarespace.com slash Gruber.
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.640]  That's the URL that lets people know you're coming from the talk show.
[27:50.640 --> 27:54.240]  And then when you do sign up, which you won't have to do for an entire month because you
[27:54.240 --> 28:01.320]  get the whole month free, but when you do sign up, use the code JG and you will save, uh,
[28:01.320 --> 28:05.720]  10% on your first order, uh, you could save a lot of money that way.
[28:05.720 --> 28:07.280]  So my thanks to Squarespace, check them out.
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.320]  If you have any sort of desire to build a website, go check them out.
[28:10.320 --> 28:11.840]  All right, force touch.
[28:11.840 --> 28:12.840]  Force touch.
[28:12.840 --> 28:14.640]  Do you think that's a good name?
[28:14.640 --> 28:22.680]  Um, I am conflicted only if only because they're calling, they're calling the gestures
[28:22.680 --> 28:25.920]  force touch and they're calling the track pad force touch.
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.080]  And I feel like the same problem with, you know, having a collection of the watch just
[28:30.080 --> 28:36.400]  called the watch, uh, it's hard to describe the gesture and also inadvertently describe
[28:36.400 --> 28:37.400]  the track pad itself.
[28:37.400 --> 28:41.280]  You know, like, we got to figure out specific language, but I think that's just a, that's,
[28:41.280 --> 28:44.880]  that's a journalist word problem.
[28:44.880 --> 28:47.720]  Um, it's not a bad name overall, I don't think.
[28:47.720 --> 28:54.960]  All right, so as a verb, it means to press a finger hard, either on your watch or on this
[28:54.960 --> 29:01.360]  new track pad, uh, to engage whatever it is that forced touch does in your current context.
[29:01.360 --> 29:02.360]  Mm hmm.
[29:02.360 --> 29:05.600]  And the track pad itself is called the force touch track pad.
[29:05.600 --> 29:06.600]  Yeah.
[29:06.600 --> 29:13.680]  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I bring this up because, um, um, uh, Dieter bone at the verge had
[29:13.680 --> 29:18.120]  an article that, you know, great track pad except for the lousy name or something like that.
[29:18.120 --> 29:19.120]  Yeah.
[29:19.120 --> 29:20.120]  What are you talking about lousy name?
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.600]  Number one, most people like have no idea what this, it's not like they're really going
[29:23.600 --> 29:24.600]  to advertise.
[29:24.600 --> 29:29.680]  I don't think that the name force touch track pad, it's just a way to distinguish it.
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.320]  And then like, you know, as the time goes on, if you have like a 13 inch MacBook pro,
[29:33.320 --> 29:36.080]  you could say, is that the one with the force touch track pad or not?
[29:36.080 --> 29:39.000]  It just is a way to clarify whether it can do it or not.
[29:39.000 --> 29:40.000]  Yeah.
[29:40.000 --> 29:45.000]  Yeah.
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  Yeah.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  Yeah.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  I see really no problem with it.
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.320]  Um, and it's honestly, it's a, it, I feel like it's a good descriptor.
[29:53.320 --> 29:55.240]  What, how was you rather describe it?
[29:55.240 --> 30:01.000]  Like the tactic engine track pad, the, the haptic track pad, like then you start,
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.120]  the only other thing I've heard that, that was even plausible would be to call it the
[30:04.120 --> 30:06.760]  Taptic track pad, which isn't bad.
[30:06.760 --> 30:11.320]  I, I, I, and I'm bet it's close enough that it was probably like on the finalist list,
[30:11.320 --> 30:16.000]  you know, like a whiteboard and Phil Schiller's office, and it says like, force touch track
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.840]  pad, taptic track pad, taptic engine track pad, taky track pad, yeah.
[30:20.840 --> 30:24.120]  And there's like a circle around force touch track pad.
[30:24.120 --> 30:25.120]  Exactly.
[30:25.120 --> 30:29.240]  With stars, um, I, yeah, I like it better than I, I used, I think both descriptions when
[30:29.240 --> 30:30.840]  I was writing about it in our hands on.
[30:30.840 --> 30:35.760]  And I, I like force touch track pad as a, as a moniker or just force touch technology
[30:35.760 --> 30:39.600]  in general, because especially, you know, we've seen it on the watch.
[30:39.600 --> 30:43.280]  Now we've, we're seeing it on a track pad that's essentially the size of an iPhone
[30:43.280 --> 30:49.320]  6 screen, I, I don't think it's unlikely that we'll see it on iOS devices, uh, in the
[30:49.320 --> 30:50.320]  next year or so.
[30:50.320 --> 30:53.520]  And as a result, like you, you're, you're going to need a, you're going to need a, a
[30:53.520 --> 30:58.120]  way to describe it versus, you know, you got a retina display with, uh, with force touch
[30:58.120 --> 30:59.800]  multitouch technology.
[30:59.800 --> 31:02.480]  That's a lot of touches, but you know what I mean, right?
[31:02.480 --> 31:10.040]  Yeah. It's, I, and the complaint against it, and I, I'm as juvenile as anybody, I think,
[31:10.040 --> 31:14.360]  but the complaint is that it's, you know, like hard hard, you know, it sounds like rape
[31:14.360 --> 31:15.680]  force touch.
[31:15.680 --> 31:16.680]  Yeah.
[31:16.680 --> 31:21.240]  And I kind of feel like you can't, anything touch can be made into that type of joke,
[31:21.240 --> 31:27.720]  like multitouch clearly can, it reminds me of the complaints that iPad sounded like, you
[31:27.720 --> 31:30.120]  know, a feminine hygiene product.
[31:30.120 --> 31:35.920]  It's like really, you know, it's, you know, I'd remember not being in love with iPad
[31:35.920 --> 31:38.880]  when they first said it, but I didn't think, well, this is awful.
[31:38.880 --> 31:43.760]  Yeah, it's not the worst name in the, there, there are plenty of more terrible names
[31:43.760 --> 31:49.200]  that I'm sure we would be much more in arms about, uh, had Apple chosen to use those
[31:49.200 --> 31:53.440]  instead of their preform once when we were, when we were playing the, what are they going
[31:53.440 --> 31:58.640]  to call their tablet guessing game, I didn't guess iPad, but my only, and, but it was one
[31:58.640 --> 32:03.040]  of the ones that was tossed out, because some kind of obvious, and my only brush aside
[32:03.040 --> 32:08.880]  of iPad was it sounds and looks too much like iPod, so they're not going to do that.
[32:08.880 --> 32:10.880]  And they just went ahead and did it.
[32:10.880 --> 32:16.520]  And like I spent two years on this show calling it an iPod.
[32:16.520 --> 32:20.240]  So I was right that it was very similar, but it's like, yeah, they did just didn't care.
[32:20.240 --> 32:21.240]  But that's it.
[32:21.240 --> 32:22.240]  I feel about the force touch thing.
[32:22.240 --> 32:23.240]  It's like, come on.
[32:23.240 --> 32:25.200]  It's not that bad name.
[32:25.200 --> 32:29.640]  It's, yeah, as I said, it's a, it's a good descriptor of what it, I mean, I did that
[32:29.640 --> 32:34.520]  or they could have called it the magical what's it trackpad you won't believe is actually
[32:34.520 --> 32:35.520]  doing.
[32:35.520 --> 32:36.520]  Yeah.
[32:36.520 --> 32:38.800]  Like I, I, you, I mean, you got a chance to test it out in the store.
[32:38.800 --> 32:39.800]  It feels wacky, right?
[32:39.800 --> 32:40.800]  It's crazy.
[32:40.800 --> 32:45.880]  You really, it's just like Matthew Panzirino said on my show last week that it's, he didn't,
[32:45.880 --> 32:49.600]  he didn't really wreck, he didn't know that it wasn't clicking until they, you know, he
[32:49.600 --> 32:53.760]  kind of, because you miss it when you're sitting there in the room watching the keynote,
[32:53.760 --> 32:57.400]  like it's, you, you can't rewind, right?
[32:57.400 --> 33:01.040]  I mean, that's, it, it was the one thing that like having, you know, getting for the first
[33:01.040 --> 33:04.840]  time in years, getting to watch one remotely instead of there.
[33:04.840 --> 33:08.760]  You definitely, it's easier, you know, to, you can pause for a second and write your note
[33:08.760 --> 33:12.000]  and then, you know, just fall behind by 10 seconds in the stream and go, when you're in
[33:12.000 --> 33:16.320]  the room, you miss stuff and he missed the emphasis that it doesn't actually move.
[33:16.320 --> 33:20.120]  And so he went in the hands-on area and was like, this is great, you know, it's neat
[33:20.120 --> 33:21.120]  the way it clicks in there.
[33:21.120 --> 33:23.000]  Well, it doesn't really click and he's like, what are you talking about?
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.120]  And then they told him and he was like, that's not true.
[33:25.120 --> 33:28.840]  And they like turned the machine off for him so he could try it when the machine was off
[33:28.840 --> 33:30.240]  and, you know, it doesn't move.
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.240]  Yeah, that's uncanny.
[33:31.240 --> 33:35.920]  And that's the baffling part is I didn't get a chance to, to try it out until, uh, until
[33:35.920 --> 33:38.360]  this week with a, with the machine completely off.
[33:38.360 --> 33:43.680]  I went to an Apple store and that is when you realize, oh, this is actually some high-level
[33:43.680 --> 33:50.280]  wizardry crap, like this, I know what it is doing in theory, like I know that, you
[33:50.280 --> 33:54.520]  know, the, it's not electromagnets, but it's, it's something similar.
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.040]  I know that it's basically sending it, sending vibrations to my finger that make it feel
[33:59.040 --> 34:01.680]  like a click, even though my finger is moving sideways.
[34:01.680 --> 34:07.120]  But in my brain, it feels like I am pressing down and the trackpad is physically depressing.
[34:07.120 --> 34:12.520]  And that's even more so, um, I don't know if they, they had like different apps, uh,
[34:12.520 --> 34:14.600]  on the app, at the Apple store that you were playing with.
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.200]  But like, I got to play with it in a couple of different things, including QuickTime.
[34:18.200 --> 34:23.440]  And the QuickTime one was the really sort of crazy wacky, my brain is being slowly disassembled
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.920]  into mush thing, um, because when you're in, when you're in QuickTime with ForceTouch, uh,
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.160]  and you press the fast forward button, as you like put a little bit more pressure on the
[34:33.160 --> 34:38.120]  trackpad, it speeds up to the point where it like, it speeds up like 60 times.
[34:38.120 --> 34:44.840]  But you can slowly release that pressure while your finger is still down and the speed starts
[34:44.840 --> 34:46.160]  to slow down again.
[34:46.160 --> 34:50.400]  So it feels almost like a gas pedal worth of, uh, worth of trackpad where you're like,
[34:50.400 --> 34:55.960]  voo voo, and like that, I don't know, it's such a, it's such a different experience
[34:55.960 --> 34:59.280]  than I've ever had on a computer.
[34:59.280 --> 35:02.920]  Like, I mean, that's a, that's a technological, like, that's old school, right?
[35:02.920 --> 35:07.280]  Cars have had that kind of control for years, uh, but being able to do that on a flat
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.440]  glass surface was, was really kind of mind bogglingly, you know, time bendingly crazy.
[35:13.440 --> 35:17.640]  Yeah, which in turn makes me wonder about like the gaming implications.
[35:17.640 --> 35:18.640]  Oh, yeah.
[35:18.640 --> 35:23.400]  The gaming implications, the drawing implications, you know, the drawing pressures, I love
[35:23.400 --> 35:29.040]  that, um, on the, on the MacBook website where they're like, uh, pressure sensitive drawing
[35:29.040 --> 35:35.440]  and then they show a picture of the, the, uh, preview signature, uh, because that's the,
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.240]  that's the only thing that Apple has in its default apps that can accurately show pressure
[35:40.240 --> 35:44.400]  sensitive drawing, but as soon as they started talking about that and I like, I quiz the
[35:44.400 --> 35:49.360]  Apple reps pretty indefinitely being like, so pressure sensitivity, how many levels do you
[35:49.360 --> 35:50.360]  have?
[35:50.360 --> 35:52.080]  Like, what, what are we talking about here?
[35:52.080 --> 35:56.760]  Um, and they are of course very, very charmingly vague as always, but, um, but what I was
[35:56.760 --> 36:01.920]  able to get out is like, there's a, there's a fair amount of ramp built into the, built
[36:01.920 --> 36:06.560]  into the underlying software technology of four-stutch, which means, and, and the fact that
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.680]  it's available as an SDK for developers to hook into, um, it basically means that like
[36:11.680 --> 36:17.440]  developers can set sort of click points and pressure points at any point like along this
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.480]  curve, uh, this, this, you know, pressure sensitivity curve.
[36:21.480 --> 36:27.400]  So in theory, you could, you could have any number of pressure points or any number of, uh,
[36:27.400 --> 36:29.120]  you know, multiple clicks.
[36:29.120 --> 36:32.000]  I, I, I just think about like going back to games for a second.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.040]  I think about, huh, playing wow in college and having to go get like a six-button mouse
[36:37.040 --> 36:44.320]  to like map all of my key combos to, and I'm like, with a four-stutch trackpad, in theory,
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.440]  you could have like a different level of pressure touch for each key combo or each, like
[36:49.440 --> 36:53.520]  mouse combo that you'd normally need like an up button, a down button, a side button,
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.080]  a squeeze button, like that, that is, that is really, really nifty to me.
[36:58.080 --> 37:07.360]  Yeah, and I think about like how, when you get really into like the type of software you specialize
[37:07.360 --> 37:13.200]  in, like if you're an audio editor or a video editor and you just live and breathe in, you know,
[37:13.200 --> 37:14.800]  your editing software.
[37:14.800 --> 37:20.400]  And once that's force-touched enabled for like scrubbing, you know, which is clearly, I mean,
[37:20.400 --> 37:24.320]  like you said, it's already built into QuickTime, so it's clearly, you know, that's the way things
[37:24.320 --> 37:30.400]  are going, but you'll be able, like once you're, you know, and you do it 40, 50, 60 hours a week,
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.440]  it's like you'll be able to play that scrub controller, like playing a musical instrument,
[37:35.440 --> 37:38.480]  you know, in terms of going faster and slower with your touch.
[37:38.480 --> 37:44.240]  Yeah, I mean, did you see the, there was an iMovie update a couple of days ago that came out with
[37:44.240 --> 37:50.720]  support for force touch track pads, and it offer, it came with two different things,
[37:50.720 --> 37:55.200]  one of which I think is a scrubbing feature. And the other was, there's a little bit,
[37:55.200 --> 38:00.160]  now when you kind of scroll through a clip, you get a little bit of haptic feedback when you come
[38:00.160 --> 38:05.040]  to the end of a clip or you bump at the end of a clip. So, I mean, I'm like, I didn't even think
[38:05.040 --> 38:10.960]  about that, where it's, again, texture as well as physical clicking.
[38:10.960 --> 38:16.320]  Yeah, it really brings back analog sensibility.
[38:16.320 --> 38:22.720]  Yeah, well, I mean, you remember the knobs, like the, the USB knobs that I want to say it's
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.520]  Kensington that makes them where, and it glowed blue, right?
[38:27.520 --> 38:33.840]  Yeah, Kensington or Belkin or something like that. But I like, I knew editors who absolutely
[38:33.840 --> 38:38.160]  relied on those knobs who were like, yeah, this is as close as I'm going to get to a physical
[38:38.160 --> 38:42.240]  editing machine. And it's like, well, five years down the line, now you, now you potentially have
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.400]  a trackpad that can do all of that. What, what is this madness? That's great. I never even thought
[38:48.400 --> 38:52.800]  about that, but that's brilliant, though, to have like just like a slight tick as you get between
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.000]  clicks. And then you can feel it. And it's again, like you go back to like the analog era when you
[38:58.000 --> 39:04.080]  people, you know, like to edit film, you'd literally splice pieces of film together. And at that
[39:04.080 --> 39:09.040]  splice, there'd be a physical, you know, like where you, you just pretty much just put tape around it,
[39:09.040 --> 39:14.800]  you know? Yeah, well, it's funny to me because you think on the, on the software side, Apple has
[39:14.800 --> 39:20.640]  been working harder and harder to kind of take the ski and morphism out of the design. But I feel
[39:20.640 --> 39:25.440]  like in a, in a large way, they're kind of putting that into hardware. So it's like we don't
[39:25.440 --> 39:31.440]  necessarily need our video clips to look like analog video clips anymore. But we're going to give
[39:31.440 --> 39:37.040]  you more and more controls on the physical side that make it feel like you're dealing with tangible
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.080]  materials that make it feel like you're actually interacting with something besides glass. I don't
[39:42.080 --> 39:48.000]  know. It feels like the, you know, the, the idea of the iPad or the iPhone as blank slate was step one
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.200]  where it's like, okay, you can load anything on it. Now we're going to let you touch anything on it.
[39:53.200 --> 39:58.480]  Got it. Wow. Where else could you do that? Like I'm even imagining like in the future if it gets
[39:58.480 --> 40:04.960]  more refined, like like as you, like if you're editing text and you have like a red squiggly
[40:04.960 --> 40:10.000]  underlined word that's misspelled, like maybe you get like a slight as you move that arrow over
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.440]  it. It buzzes. Yeah. Or like just a little bit of friction or something. Yeah. Just uh, well,
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.160]  yeah, it makes your scroll slightly slower. Right. Like maybe you want to stop here. Yeah.
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.280]  Well, and the accessibility implications too are huge. Like imagine instead of having to have a
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.760]  Braille keyboard or a Braille touchpad, um, turning on maybe accessibility braille or something
[40:31.760 --> 40:36.480]  like that and then all of a sudden, you know, you're, you're moving your cursor over words and it
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.280]  feels like the Braille version of the word. Like obviously that's probably years down the line,
[40:41.280 --> 40:46.480]  but it's still like the potential of that is really cool. Right. Or anytime it hovers over a button
[40:46.480 --> 40:53.040]  really. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Popping up buttons. I'm sure just like with almost every SDK that
[40:53.040 --> 40:58.000]  has weird, crazy things like this, I'm sure that everybody in their mother is going to make
[40:58.000 --> 41:02.560]  buttons that give you haptic feedback for like the first year, right? Where you like you roll over
[41:02.560 --> 41:08.240]  it. It's like every single button goes like bump bump bump bump bump bump. But as people kind of get
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.520]  more used to it, I feel like we could, we can have some really, really revolutionary stuff.
[41:13.520 --> 41:18.320]  Yeah. The thing that really blew me away was, and I've known this because I've, I've never been
[41:18.320 --> 41:23.440]  fully on board with their getting rid of the separate buttons for the trackpad.
[41:23.440 --> 41:29.120]  And so like, you know, like step one was they got rid of buttons and made the whole trackpad
[41:29.120 --> 41:34.800]  button. Yeah. And I've never been fully on board with that because, and Shiller, you know, showed
[41:34.800 --> 41:40.080]  the mechanics of it exactly because it's like a teeter totter with the fulcrum at the top.
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.560]  Yeah, you can't click on the top. It's hard to click on the top. And I click at the top way more
[41:44.560 --> 41:49.680]  than I click at the bottom because the menus bars at the top, you know, the, the close button for
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.120]  windows is at the top, the tabs are at the top. So I've never been fully on board with that because
[41:55.120 --> 42:01.280]  the trackpad clicks better at the bottom. And even for years, I guess I've kind of gotten away
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.000]  from it, but the way that you can still keep your thumb at the bottom and just do all your clicks
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.080]  there, even if you, you know, moving it, they kind of let you treat it like the buttons are still
[42:10.080 --> 42:14.880]  there at the bottom. With the force touch trackpad, the click is the same everywhere. Yeah.
[42:14.880 --> 42:19.920]  And it's like, this is the first one we're not having the standalone buttons. There's no trade
[42:19.920 --> 42:26.480]  off involved. No, it's, it, it is really cool. Like I, I intentionally, when I played around with it
[42:26.480 --> 42:30.800]  in the hands on, I intentionally was like clicking in corners, trying to like see all right,
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.600]  well, is this really click anywhere or is it like click in the center? And it really is like
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.640]  you can go to the top left corner. And I think I only got one bad click out of like 10 minutes
[42:40.640 --> 42:45.440]  playing around with that trackpad. My son was really skeptical. So he's fifth grade and they have
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.240]  a bunch of Chromebooks at his school. And it's not because he's my son. He just, he said all the
[42:52.240 --> 42:58.000]  kids hate them because all the kids have like apples and they all hate him. And then like the one
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.640]  day it was like they had like everybody got in trouble because a whole bunch of them got like
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.960]  trashed. And I was like, that's why you guys have Chromebooks instead of MacBooks because
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.680]  you're a bunch of reckless for anyway. But all the, the Chromebooks they have don't click,
[43:11.680 --> 43:16.720]  their tap track pads. You move around. And then you just tap to do it. And he said that's,
[43:16.720 --> 43:19.840]  and that's what he thought this was going to be like. And I said, no, I'm telling you, I was like,
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.880]  I haven't felt it yet. But trust me, there's no way Apple would chip it like that. And he was like,
[43:24.880 --> 43:29.760]  rolling his eyes. And he was like, I'm so glad I already have my track pad that clicks. And then we got
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.600]  to the store. And he was, you know, he was like, okay, you were right, this is nothing like the,
[43:33.600 --> 43:39.440]  the Chromebooks. Yeah. I mean, I've hated tap like, I have tapped to click on now. But I,
[43:39.440 --> 43:45.200]  this is like after seven years of being like, tap to click is horrible. And you accidentally,
[43:45.200 --> 43:50.240]  you know, brush on it. And then your cursor moves everywhere. And it just, it's, it's such an
[43:50.240 --> 43:57.360]  uncomfortable compromise. Um, especially, um, if you like have it like, I like having my track pad
[43:57.360 --> 44:03.760]  very, uh, very responsive. I like it being very quick. Uh, so having tapped to click on it's like,
[44:03.760 --> 44:08.000]  oh, you move it once and then all of a sudden your track pad's over here and, and you're selecting
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.320]  some text that you never intended. Um, I don't know, I like the physical buttons. I've always
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.200]  liked the physical buttons. And so having Apple actually be able to, to build something that feels
[44:17.200 --> 44:24.240]  like physical buttons, but uses the, uses the technology of, of the multi touch track pad. It's
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.640]  really cool. Yeah. All right. Let me take a break. I'm still not done talking about force touch,
[44:28.640 --> 44:35.280]  but let me take a break and thank our next sponsor. And it's our good friends at foremost,
[44:35.280 --> 44:44.000]  F O R E M O S T, their brand new small batch American made clothing line for men and women,
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.640]  each month, foremost, designs and produces limited collections of men's and women's clothing,
[44:50.640 --> 44:56.560]  roughly four or five items per gender, not a lot, not overwhelming, underwhelming, almost in terms
[44:56.560 --> 45:01.120]  of selection. You go there. You can check it out very quickly. See if you're interested. And if you
[45:01.120 --> 45:07.360]  are, you can buy it. Um, and it's, it's also an editorial publication and they have a great
[45:07.360 --> 45:12.720]  interview series with some of the world's most inspiring creative people. Um, and importantly,
[45:12.720 --> 45:19.360]  the average price of foremost products is under 50 bucks. So this is definitely affordable stuff.
[45:19.360 --> 45:24.560]  Uh, and again, made in America, really cool stuff. This is pure coincidence. I didn't even know
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.720]  they were on the schedule to be the sponsor today. I'm actually wearing today a sweater that I bought
[45:28.720 --> 45:34.720]  last month from them. Um, that I, my wife is like, you gonna wear that one again? I really like it.
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.520]  It's a nice sweater. Uh, so they just launched their second collection this week. Uh, their
[45:41.520 --> 45:48.160]  interviews this month include Eller Coltrane. She's, uh, the star of Boyhood, which I still haven't
[45:48.160 --> 45:53.120]  seen, but I've heard is an amazing movie. The only reason I haven't seen it is I'm like saving it
[45:53.120 --> 45:58.400]  because I know I'm going to love it because I'm such a big fan of, um, uh, Richard Linklatter.
[45:59.120 --> 46:06.400]  Uh, another interview is Anna Margaret Holleyman, independent actress, writer and film director.
[46:07.200 --> 46:11.760]  Uh, and this is brought to you by the same people, uh, who did need, who's sponsored to show him
[46:11.760 --> 46:18.240]  but has been the past need as a curated retailer and publication from men. And they just launched
[46:18.240 --> 46:26.160]  their latest collection to featuring items to transition from fall into spring. Uh, talk show
[46:26.160 --> 46:35.840]  listeners interested in visiting foremost or need either one can use the promo code promo code.
[46:35.840 --> 46:45.760]  I love these guys. That's the promo code. All one word. P R O M O C O D E. The promo code is promo
[46:45.760 --> 46:53.680]  code at checkout. And and you'll receive 20% off. Go to foremost edition, edition, not edition,
[46:53.680 --> 47:02.640]  not like math, foremost edition.com, uh, or need edition.com and use that promo code. And so
[47:02.640 --> 47:08.640]  in other words, the stuff is already under 50 bucks on average, you can save 20% off with that code
[47:08.640 --> 47:12.880]  and it's really cool stuff. So go check them out. Uh, I could not be happier with the stuff that
[47:12.880 --> 47:23.600]  I've bought from. Um, so I, I think everybody's thinking about this. So usually the last, I would
[47:23.600 --> 47:30.000]  say, you know, really pretty much since the iPhone came out, iOS has sort of been the leading edge
[47:30.000 --> 47:37.840]  platform for, for new stuff. Um, and it was, you know, it wasn't like back to iPhone. It was back
[47:37.840 --> 47:45.200]  to the Mac once, you know, stuff like multi touch and things like that. Um, but here's force touch
[47:45.200 --> 47:52.080]  and iOS is last platform to the game. Yeah, you could argue that the watch technically
[47:52.080 --> 47:57.280]  led with it, but the watch isn't out yet. And the, I mean, I guess the MacBook is now yet either,
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.360]  but, but yeah, I'm, I think it's interesting because I mean, we've heard rumors about
[48:03.360 --> 48:09.920]  haptic feedback, uh, coming to the Mac and iOS platforms for years. I want to say the first, uh,
[48:09.920 --> 48:14.880]  the first patent over this thing came out. I want to say like three or four months after the
[48:14.880 --> 48:20.240]  original iPad. Um, I remember, you know, looking over in a frenzy, being like pressure sensitive
[48:20.240 --> 48:28.080]  screen, pressure sensitive screen drawing. Oh my gosh. Um, but, uh, yeah, I, I feel like this
[48:28.080 --> 48:37.200]  technology has been very long in development. Um, and it just, it's which, uh, the, the platform
[48:37.200 --> 48:44.080]  that made the most sense to launch it on, I think is probable. I, when I think about launching it
[48:44.080 --> 48:52.400]  on iOS versus launching it on the Mac, I feel like there's a lot more flexibility on the Mac
[48:52.400 --> 48:59.760]  platform, if that makes sense, uh, than iOS in that, um, iOS has so many different multi-touch
[48:59.760 --> 49:05.920]  controls at this point, especially when you translate over to the iPad, um, that introducing
[49:05.920 --> 49:11.200]  force touch on the, on the phone first being like, not only do you have contextual menus for
[49:11.200 --> 49:16.080]  force touch, but we're opening this up to app developers. And I feel, I'm like, I'm trying
[49:16.080 --> 49:19.840]  to think about when you would launch such a thing, it would probably be WWDC because, you
[49:19.840 --> 49:25.760]  know, you want an SDK for this and all of that. Um, and the only real time to do that would
[49:25.760 --> 49:32.600]  have been last year during the iOS 8 extravaganza explosion. Um, and that's actually, that's
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.000]  an interesting point. I haven't thought about that. So, hm. How do you, like, so they did
[49:38.000 --> 49:42.960]  last year is a perfect example where they snuck into WWDC, not snuck, but they had a whole bunch
[49:42.960 --> 49:52.240]  of sessions, important sessions on, um, the display sizes, you know, which really only made sense
[49:52.240 --> 49:58.480]  in the context of there are going to be some new screen sizes. Oh, yeah. But they didn't say that.
[49:58.480 --> 50:04.000]  They, it was all sort of hypothetical. Like if, if you had a device that was bigger than an iPhone,
[50:04.000 --> 50:09.440]  but smaller than an iPad, blah, blah, blah. Hypothetically, I'm not sure they could get away with
[50:09.440 --> 50:16.080]  that with force touch. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Well, yeah, exactly where they're like,
[50:16.080 --> 50:24.400]  oh, potentially, this thing is coming down the line, hint hint, nudge nudge, um, whereas if you
[50:24.400 --> 50:30.080]  lead off with force touch of the watch and force touch in the Mac, um, and you lead off in the
[50:30.080 --> 50:36.000]  spring with it, that gives people all of the spring, all of the summer, some of the fall to get
[50:36.000 --> 50:43.040]  used to developing properly with it. You know, we were talking about button, button, a pollousa,
[50:43.040 --> 50:48.880]  like it gets a, it allows developers to kind of get all of their, um, immediate must use this
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.560]  everywhere kind of out of their system and it allows them to get to know the force touch, touch
[50:54.560 --> 51:00.400]  technology well enough so that when, say, they come out down the line in September saying, oh,
[51:00.400 --> 51:05.600]  guess what? You know that iPad pro rumor or, you know, the iPhone, the iPhone it has force touch too
[51:05.600 --> 51:11.600]  now. We have, we have force touch across all our devices and, uh, we'll release an SDK for developers
[51:11.600 --> 51:15.680]  to, uh, to be able to build with it. Uh, any developer who's already been playing around on the
[51:15.680 --> 51:20.160]  Mac is like, oh, yeah, I know how force touch works. I know perfectly how I could implement this into my
[51:20.160 --> 51:27.040]  app, whereas, you know, you try and do it the other way around. Um, you try and launch, you know,
[51:27.040 --> 51:35.280]  a brand new technology, uh, on, on iOS in advance. I don't, I don't know. I, I lost my train of thought
[51:35.280 --> 51:40.960]  that I, well, one of the things, I mean, you, you personally are like, uh, I don't know, I don't know,
[51:40.960 --> 51:45.760]  I don't know, even like a hobbyist level illustrator. You like to sketch, you like to draw.
[51:45.760 --> 51:48.800]  So clearly that's one of the things you're personally looking at this for.
[51:48.800 --> 51:55.600]  Absolutely. But it's way more interesting on iOS, especially the iPad than it is on the Mac for
[51:55.600 --> 52:01.200]  drawing, because drawing on a trackpad is always going to have, no matter how sensitive the trackpad
[52:01.200 --> 52:07.440]  is, there's that layer of indirection where you're drawing on this thing that doesn't show what
[52:07.440 --> 52:11.600]  you're drawing and you're looking above it on a display where it shows what you're drawing,
[52:11.600 --> 52:17.200]  whereas drawing on an iPad, it's right there. It's drawing directly on the screen. Yeah, it's the,
[52:17.200 --> 52:24.640]  the contrast between anybody who's ever used a, a whackum tablet. Um, it's the difference between
[52:24.640 --> 52:30.560]  an intos to, you know, just sketching on this, on the static, uh, the static surface and having it
[52:30.560 --> 52:35.520]  reflect on the screen versus like a Cintiq, which is a monitor. So actually having it directly
[52:35.520 --> 52:40.160]  under, um, when the force touch first came out, I got really excited and I wrote an article and I
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.640]  more about, you know, what, what does this mean for the rumored iPad pro and what does this mean for
[52:44.640 --> 52:50.800]  iPads in general? And someone was like, you can't use force touch on a, on a multi touch screen with
[52:50.800 --> 52:55.440]  a, with pixels, it's going to damage the pixels. And I got a really good laugh out of that.
[52:56.080 --> 53:04.160]  So I'm like, technically a, a MacBook trackpad is a, uh, oop, they're what my phone. Um, it's fine.
[53:04.160 --> 53:09.280]  It's in a case. Um, the MacBook trackpad is a multi touch screen, essentially. They're just,
[53:09.280 --> 53:14.240]  they're no pixels underneath it. And again, the glass doesn't move. It is glass. Yeah.
[53:14.240 --> 53:19.920]  I mean, I, I'm sure it's engineering wise trickier because you've also got a display, but it's sure
[53:19.920 --> 53:25.760]  you got a map. You got a Mac, the, uh, your input to specific pixels on the screen. Yeah.
[53:25.760 --> 53:30.880]  Which is also, I mean, that's something, um, speaking from putting my illustrator hat on for a
[53:30.880 --> 53:36.480]  second, that's something that, uh, illustrators and stylist makers have struggled with a lot with
[53:36.480 --> 53:43.600]  the iPad, uh, because the iPads, uh, initial touch targets were very much built for finger-sized
[53:43.600 --> 53:50.160]  input. Uh, so it's also why you saw like styluses with these big round sort of, uh, rubbery nibs,
[53:50.160 --> 53:55.520]  uh, the first couple of years. Um, and also why, if you have an iPad Air 2 and a stylist,
[53:55.520 --> 54:01.120]  all of a sudden, the stylist like is cruddy. It doesn't work very well anymore because between the iPad
[54:01.120 --> 54:07.840]  Air and the iPad Air 2, they like completely changed how finger input was done. So, uh, so on a,
[54:07.840 --> 54:11.120]  from a finger point, doesn't feel like anything, but from a stylist, all of a sudden,
[54:11.120 --> 54:16.640]  like, uh, the pixels are off-mapped and everything's off-center and, uh, sometimes you won't even,
[54:16.640 --> 54:20.880]  like, it doesn't even connect, like, it's a bunch of, a bunch of gibberish, which,
[54:20.880 --> 54:28.240]  anyway, like the, the point of that is just that, um, actually having mapped pixels to pressure
[54:28.240 --> 54:35.440]  sensitivity and, uh, and a pressure sensitive screen would be huge for artists. And like,
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.120]  I just, I, you know, I dick around. I, I sketch sometimes. I'm not, you know, I'm not a heavy
[54:39.120 --> 54:43.760]  duty illustrator, but I talked to like, I have friends who are cartoonists and web cartoonists
[54:43.760 --> 54:48.640]  who, you know, who have been wanting them a pressure sensitive iPad screen for, for years,
[54:48.640 --> 54:53.600]  because the idea, especially with something like handoff, the idea of being able to start a
[54:53.600 --> 54:59.600]  sketch on your iPad and have the same amount of control and precision as you do, you know,
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.960]  working on a, on a whack-um-sintique, it's, it's a pipe dream. It's a, it's like that, that is the thing
[55:04.960 --> 55:12.080]  that, uh, that artists want. Yeah. And I think that it's only natural that the smarts go
[55:12.080 --> 55:19.280]  into the drawing surface and not the stylus. Yeah. You know, and you only wait to get any kind
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.840]  of pressure sensitivity up until now on iOS is to use some kind of pressure sensitive stylus.
[55:23.840 --> 55:27.520]  And it's just, I, I just feel like that's not right. And it's, you know, it even harkens back to
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.640]  the analog days where the pressure is registered on paper. It's, the pen isn't smart about it.
[55:32.640 --> 55:36.800]  You know, it's the paper that absorbs the pressure if you're going to do a hard stroke versus a light
[55:36.800 --> 55:40.880]  stroke. Yeah, absolutely. And actually, that's something going back to like forced touch and
[55:40.880 --> 55:46.880]  haptics. Um, that's one of the things that got me super excited is not just that the, uh,
[55:46.880 --> 55:50.480]  that the screen is recognizing your pressure and whether you're, you know, you're making a little,
[55:50.480 --> 55:56.320]  uh, a light thin line or a dark thick line based on your pressure. But if the haptics can,
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.920]  if the haptics can provide click feedback, it's a possibility that they can provide a little bit of
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.800]  rumbling feedback while you're drawing to to give you a little bit more, or at least feel like
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.800]  you're getting a little bit more resistance, which I don't know if you've ever tried drawing on an
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.600]  iPad screen, but one of my biggest criticisms has always been the fact that like if you're drawing
[56:15.600 --> 56:19.440]  with anything fine tipped or even if, you know, even with a rubber stylus or one of those
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.840]  paintbrush styluses, it feels like you're drawing on glass. There's no, there's, there's no, uh,
[56:25.840 --> 56:30.800]  pretending that like even on a whackum tablet, it feels like you're drawing on glass or on plastic.
[56:30.800 --> 56:37.040]  It doesn't feel like paper. And like if haptics could do that, even even to like 50% of what
[56:37.040 --> 56:41.760]  paper feels like, that could be really incredible, right? Like that, that's a completely different
[56:41.760 --> 56:47.600]  experience that we're feeling, um, with what's otherwise a stationary glass surface.
[56:49.200 --> 56:54.640]  Yeah. So the things that come to mind for me for the future of this tactic engine going
[56:54.640 --> 57:01.520]  across everything Apple does for iOS, it artists definitely, it also really makes me think about
[57:02.240 --> 57:07.600]  like if you know, like you brought up the rumored, you know, mythical iPad pro, you know, which
[57:07.600 --> 57:12.080]  obviously is not coming out the spring, maybe now if people have think maybe that's part of the big
[57:12.080 --> 57:17.680]  fall, you know, stuff this year. I, you know, everybody's been saying that for a long time and
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.080]  there've been rumors that Apple's, you know, commissioning screens and stuff like that. But then
[57:22.080 --> 57:27.200]  it's, I've always thought, well, who's the market, right? And artists would definitely be one,
[57:27.200 --> 57:32.960]  right? Like I think, and you know, no question. Yeah. Right. No question. Um, so I think that's
[57:32.960 --> 57:38.640]  got to be, you know, if, if that device exists, that has to be part of it, I think. I feel like the
[57:38.640 --> 57:44.000]  iPad pro market, the only way that they're going to, like Apple has developed machines that are
[57:44.000 --> 57:50.880]  primarily designed for the creative area before, um, which is to say like the Mac pros for,
[57:50.880 --> 57:57.280]  for a long time was designed for software engineers and filmmakers and, you know, people who
[57:57.280 --> 58:02.800]  are doing high level video intensive work. Um, but, you know, people have argued, well, Apple doesn't
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.040]  really care about creatives anymore. And I don't necessarily think that's true, but I think their,
[58:07.040 --> 58:12.240]  their viewpoint has broadened a little bit. And I kind of feel like for the iPad pro to be
[58:12.240 --> 58:18.880]  successful, it has to aggressively target business in a way. And, um, again, from, from an artist
[58:18.880 --> 58:22.560]  perspective, I see force touch being very useful because of the haptics, because of the pressure,
[58:22.560 --> 58:29.840]  all of that. Um, but from a business perspective, the thing that kind of caught my attention,
[58:29.840 --> 58:36.720]  um, when we were talking about bigger screens and also haptic responses, um, digital keyboards.
[58:36.720 --> 58:41.600]  The idea, like we've seen really, really crappy implementations of this in, in Blackberry a couple
[58:41.600 --> 58:45.680]  years ago when they actually, you know, they made the screen click, uh, for I think the Blackberry
[58:45.680 --> 58:51.440]  storm and the storm to had electro magnetic responses, but it just didn't feel very good. And it was
[58:51.440 --> 58:56.640]  really, uh, really sketchy, didn't, didn't quite work when you're tapping on it. But if you had an
[58:56.640 --> 59:03.040]  iPad pro say that was, I don't know, 12, 13 inches. Um, and you had haptics available for drawing
[59:03.040 --> 59:08.000]  programs. But then you pull up the keyboard. And when you're typing, you get the feeling that you're
[59:08.000 --> 59:15.440]  physically depressing keys. Um, and you, you get the feeling of like, uh, being on a key versus typing
[59:15.440 --> 59:22.480]  in between a key, uh, I feel like that could potentially be a game changer for the iPad in regards
[59:22.480 --> 59:26.720]  to, to writing and functioning with it. Yeah. I thought of that too. I think that would even,
[59:26.720 --> 59:32.640]  in theory, I could see how that would even help on the phone. Oh, yeah. But the big butt is that
[59:32.640 --> 59:39.520]  it seems like you'd only get that feedback. After pressing. Yeah. So it's more, it's not like you'd
[59:39.520 --> 59:44.480]  know, I don't see how they could do it unless they could actually raise the screen in advance,
[59:44.480 --> 59:50.240]  which doesn't seem like that technology exists yet, especially if you're talking, you know, at the
[59:50.240 --> 59:55.760]  same time about Apple's desire to move from glass to sapphire, which is hard, like you can't make
[59:55.760 --> 1:00:02.000]  sapphire raise up in a bubble on the fly. Some substance could and, you know, but you wouldn't get
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:06.400]  that feedback before you press. You don't get it afterwards. It would just be a way to know that
[1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:13.280]  maybe you just, you thought you were typing a D, but ooh, it feels like I got the D and the F at the
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:19.120]  same time. Yeah. The other thought is you use the pressure sensitivity to be that when you lightly
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:23.920]  brush your fingers against the keyboard, it doesn't actually type down. It just lets you feel
[1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:28.960]  what those keys. And then when you press a little bit harder, it types for you. Yeah. That might be
[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:35.120]  a little bit of a, or might be too much of an adjustment to do on an iPad, but I like the idea,
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:39.680]  especially, I was actually thinking about it after I got a chance to type on the new MacBook
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:45.200]  going back to that for a second because the, the new MacBooks keys, I mean, they talked a lot about
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:50.720]  the, the butterfly design and all of that. But the keys are significantly shorter and thinner
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:56.640]  than they are even on the current MacBook Air. And initially, it took a second for me to kind of
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:02.000]  get used to it because it, I, I was really like hammering down on the keys because it's what I've,
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:07.360]  I'm used to with the air and like the, even the older, the older keyboard keyboards with like really
[1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:15.120]  thick manual keys. But with the MacBook, after a little bit of like tinkering with it, like
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:22.080]  feeling it out, I found that I was almost gliding around the, gliding around the, the, the keyboard
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:26.320]  when I was typing. So it didn't, you know, it wasn't like physically picking my finger up tapping
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:33.200]  another thing, physically done it, but it was moving my fingers very quickly and only pressing down
[1:01:33.200 --> 1:01:38.960]  when I felt kind of like the ridges onto a certain key. I just like, I don't know if that makes
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:46.720]  any sense, but it, it feels to me like the new MacBook keyboard is practically a, like a
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:53.600]  force touch track that it's, it's so small and so thin that it like, I don't know, it, it, it,
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:57.920]  it feels like that, that is potentially down the line where Apple could go keyboards.
[1:01:57.920 --> 1:02:03.360]  It, it, it makes me think I won't like it because I feel like, but on the other hand, I've never
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:08.960]  liked typing on any laptop keyboard ever made. It's all just a degree of how little I like it
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:16.400]  compared to a real solid clicky desktop keyboard. Um, it's intriguing to me though, I do, and I,
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:20.880]  I love that slow motion video they made of the fingers, you know, making the whole thing go to
[1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.440]  the keyboard. Yeah. Well, I, I would call it like a, not a thinness, but like a shallowness,
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:29.360]  that's the main thing. Yeah. It doesn't, it just does not that there's just inner physically
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:33.280]  isn't the room to press down. I just sent you a link and this is way before your time. This
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:40.800]  was like, Oh, no, I know, I know the already 400. Sorry 400. Yeah. I remember wanting one. So,
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.040]  but I wanted every computer at the end of course I wanted one of everything and I got none of them.
[1:02:46.080 --> 1:02:50.480]  But I remember when this came out and they had demo units at like, I think it was Kmart, one of
[1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:54.640]  the stores had and there was the Atari 800 to the 800 at a real keyboard. I'll put this in the
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:58.720]  show and I'll see Atari 400, which had, I don't even know what you would call that. What would you
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:05.520]  call that? That keyboard? I feel like that was a touch type keyboard before touch type was a thing on,
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:10.720]  on max where it's just like, it's a, it's a mat with slightly raised indents for where keys
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:17.040]  should be. But there's, they're like little, um, like little tiny buttons hidden underneath the keys
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:23.360]  and not even buttons. They're like, uh, dimples. Right. It was so bad. And I remember all of my friend,
[1:03:23.360 --> 1:03:27.840]  even though, you know, I was the one, the weird one who was obsessed with keyboard clicking this
[1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.560]  even at that age and nobody else really cared, but everybody agreed. My God, this computer's keyboard
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:38.640]  is the biggest piece of crap ever. Like this is insane. I think it was like a classic, I'm guessing
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:44.320]  internally at Apple. It was like a classic upsell where the Atari 400 really only existed to get
[1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:51.040]  people to buy the Atari 800. Oh, yeah. Where it's like, sure, you could, you could have this or for
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:54.960]  X amount of dollars more. You could have a real keyboard. You want a real keyboard, don't you?
[1:03:55.760 --> 1:04:00.880]  It was, so they, they advertised it as an advanced child proof design featuring a pressure
[1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:06.640]  sensitive wipe clean keyboard. Well, I mean, I guess it would be a lot harder to spill
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:12.640]  Apple sauce on it. I don't know. I mean, I feel like spilling something on any computer in the
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:18.720]  80s was bad news period. Yeah. But it's, you know, I think the new MacBook keyboard can be that one.
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:23.760]  Yeah. Well, so I, like, I completely under has standard hesitation on it because I was deaf. Like,
[1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:29.600]  I don't, I'm not a huge fan of the laptop keyboards, especially the increasing obsession with
[1:04:30.880 --> 1:04:36.720]  thinner and, and shallower keyboards, but you need it for, for a computer that's so thin that
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:44.880]  that it makes the current MacBook Airs look like, you know, giants. But I, like, I genuinely
[1:04:44.880 --> 1:04:49.600]  really, really enjoyed typing on it. And I don't know if it's just, I physically noticed the
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:54.400]  wobble of the keys after using that MacBook, like going back to my MacBook Air, but there is
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:05:01.440]  something significantly faster feeling about typing on it. Once you get used to it, the first
[1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:06.880]  five minutes, it feels like you're typing in Bizarro land or almost like you're typing on glass,
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:11.440]  where it's your, because I, like, when I first started using it, I was pounding so hard that
[1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:16.640]  I was making the entire computer shake. And I was, I was really kind of surprised by that,
[1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:20.800]  because I'm like, I, I don't feel like I'm typing that much harder than I do on my Air. And then
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:25.760]  once I sort of lightened up my pressure on it, I was able to go really fast. That's how I type
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:31.440]  on every device. Yeah, it's like, man, man, man, man. But no, it's, I don't know what, it was just a
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:38.960]  really quick learning curve. And I really, I really enjoyed it. I, to the point where I'm now that
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:44.800]  I'm using my MacBook, you know, going back to using my 11 inch MacBook Air. I'm kind of jealous.
[1:05:44.800 --> 1:05:50.000]  I, I, I really want to use that keyboard, not enough to get a new MacBook, but, but enough that
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.720]  I'm like, all right, can it be next year already? I would, I would like to see this, if all,
[1:05:54.720 --> 1:06:00.480]  then to the other computers. So this brings us back full circle into where we were an hour ago,
[1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:05.840]  talking about the a week later, how people see more upset about the new MacBook than they were
[1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:10.160]  on the day of the event. Like, as it settled in, people are upset. And one of the things I've
[1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:17.840]  detected recurring complaint is that clearly what people wanted were the MacBook Air as we know it
[1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:22.400]  with a retina screen. Oh, yeah. They're not going to get it. And because I think they know in
[1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:29.120]  her heart, this means they're never going to get it that as prices drop on the components for this
[1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:34.800]  new MacBook, and it can, it once they can make it for like $9.99, I don't know if they'll get it,
[1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:39.040]  if they'll do it all the, maybe they'll keep the 11 inch air around longer at $8.99 or something,
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:44.560]  but once they can make this $9.99, the MacBook Air goes away. Yeah, I have to assume so, which
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:50.000]  makes me a little bummed, to be honest. I really like the 11 inch computer, but the 12 inch is
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.880]  not that much bigger, honestly. It's not that much, it's not like, you have a little bit of
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:01.360]  width here and there, but overall, it has very similarly the same footprint.
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:08.480]  Yeah, it's a funny sort of way that like they've, they've expanded a lot of other things. Now
[1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:16.320]  there's two iPad sizes. Now there's three iPhone sizes, and at least two at the, you know, current,
[1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:21.840]  you know, the latest and greatest, but now they're taking the standard MacBook from two sizes to
[1:07:21.840 --> 1:07:27.280]  one size, sort of splitting the difference. Yeah, bringing it down to all right, the air is if you
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:31.280]  want the light model, you're just going to have to make do with 12 inches. And if you want more
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:39.440]  screen size variation, then let's look at the pro, the pro line. Yeah, I think that's definitely
[1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:44.080]  it, but I think that it's as that settled in, people realize they're never going to get an air,
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:48.080]  as we know it, where, okay, we're going to sacrifice a little, you know, it's not going to be
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:53.360]  the thinnest in the world, but it has, you know, a separate power port. It has MagSafe, it has a
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:08:03.360]  couple of USB ports, has a Thunderbolt, this, you know, dongle, not a dongle port. Yeah, because it,
[1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:09.360]  the dongle is what you want to avoid. And it's just not going to happen. And I guess people, as
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:13.920]  I'd settled in now, people are getting, I mean, people are getting angry. But I, I still still
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:20.560]  think though, like, but look at how different it is where in 2008, when Apple unveiled the air.
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:27.040]  No one wanted an air. It was $3,100 to get the good one. And now you can get a good new MacBook
[1:08:27.040 --> 1:08:32.720]  for 1300. The base model is actually pretty good. Yeah, it's not bad at all. I got, you know, my most
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:39.440]  recent air is $1,400, something like that for a completely maxed out. And I loved it. It was a,
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.480]  it was a great choice. Yeah. And I, the other thing I feel like people cannot get through their
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:50.960]  head is the way that Apple is clearly saying, you're not supposed to work with power connection.
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:58.080]  You're, you know, your, you know, the future is not just wireless peripherals, but wireless power,
[1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:03.200]  you know, that you're, you're going to charge when you're, you know, at somewhere like overnight.
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:06.240]  And then you're going to use the thing all day without having it plugged in.
[1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:11.040]  You're just going to run with it. Yeah. And, you know what, I was actually my one concern with the
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:16.240]  new MacBook was the lack of a MagSafe, especially. I, I don't know if you saw on Twitter,
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:22.240]  but yesterday I had a, a fun accident with my MacBook Air where it flew like six feet out of a
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:27.840]  backpack. Yeah. So I picked up my backpack and it wasn't zipped all the way. And as I, like,
[1:09:27.840 --> 1:09:32.480]  picked it up to swing it around on to my back, my MacBook Air flew out of the back,
[1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:37.440]  out of the backpack and like slammed onto the ground. And it's fine, except for Corradent,
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:43.280]  because SSDs are magical things. Wow. Yeah. And, and like thick bezels, thank God for not
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:52.000]  edge to edge class, glass screens. But that said, like, I, as soon as that happened and I was like,
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:56.800]  after I got over the heart attack and they're like, oh my God, my MacBook's okay. I immediately
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:01.520]  thought of, oh God, this is what's going to happen to 100 MacBooks when someone trips over the
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:07.200]  USB-C cord, because they're just, they're just going to go flying through the air, aren't they? Um,
[1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:14.160]  and like, I'm, I'm kind of concerned still about the USB-C being the, the power charging solution,
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:19.920]  but it's like you said, I really think that by taking away MagSafe, Apple is basically saying,
[1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:24.080]  yo, you don't need to charge this computer, you know, nine, 10 hours of battery life,
[1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:30.400]  that should be good enough for anyone using this. And for me, I'm like, that's right on the edge.
[1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:36.240]  I feel like I would have been a lot more comfortable if they had released a machine that was like
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:42.240]  14 to 16 hours of battery life. Yeah. Light web browsing because 14 to 16 hours translates
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:48.080]  probably into seven to eight hours of like heavy usage or running multiple programs or, you know,
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:54.720]  watching video. Yeah, it's Safari tabs open. Exactly. You know, basically how any, how any, you know,
[1:10:54.720 --> 1:11:01.520]  moderate to pro user destroys their, their travel machine. Um, so nine to 10 hours makes me a little
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:06.240]  bit nervous, especially like, so during the keynote, um, I had a, I had my 11 inch MacBook Air,
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:12.480]  which has the same, you know, this is last year's model has the same, uh, reported nine to 10
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:19.520]  hours as the new MacBook. And I had it tethered to a, to a Canon route or a, uh, uh, Mark II shooting
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:26.560]  the keynote and the battery went from 100% fully charged to 19% in an hour and 20 minutes.
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:33.040]  With that tethering. And I, I ended up having to take out the, take off the tethering and turn my
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:37.520]  screen down really low and just spend the rest of the, the keynote like, all right, I'm just gonna,
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:42.960]  I'm in a right color. No more photographs. Uh, so I, I think about things like that where I'm like,
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:50.560]  yes, this is not, this is not the ideal use case for this, for this new MacBook. Um, but still,
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:58.880]  you know, it, it should probably last more than two hours, um, in high usage scenarios, um,
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:04.160]  without needing to be plugged in. And for people like, maybe, maybe Apple's just saying those,
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:08.480]  those people, you know, people who need high usage, high battery things, maybe you should still
[1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:13.120]  look at a computer that has a MagSafe. All right, for now. Yeah, for now. And you know, and it's,
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:18.560]  I'm not trying to say that it's not a loss because I like almost everybody. I don't know if
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.000]  there's anybody who hasn't had one incident over the last, the MagSafe era where somebody tripped
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.480]  over a cable and MagSafe just popped, you know, as advertised, popped right out and you were like,
[1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:34.320]  wow, that MagSafe just might have saved my computer. It's happened to me. Uh, so I'm not
[1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:40.480]  underplaying it. I definitely think that not having MagSafe is in some ways it's a loss because
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:46.640]  MagSafe is amazing. And what a clever idea and nobody else has it, um, low these many years later.
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:55.040]  Um, surprisingly, but I really think that the message is you shouldn't be using it while it's
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:00.320]  powering or at least while it's connected to a wall outlet. And so think about it. And when this,
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:05.600]  when, when Mark German's, uh, scoop on this design hit a couple, I think it was in January,
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:10.960]  mm-hmm. Yes. And everybody, you know, the, the first thing everybody said, well, this, this
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:14.960]  has to be wrong because there's no MagSafe and there's no way they're going to get rid of MagSafe. And
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:22.480]  then the people who obviously had the right idea were like, well, iPad doesn't have MagSafe and
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:30.400]  an awful lot of people use their iPad the way other people use a MacBook. Um, and you think
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:36.640]  about that. And then you also think, well, then what do you do with an iPad if you're using it all day,
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:41.600]  you know, as a writer, as a student, as whatever. And you're low on power. Well, you don't plug it
[1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:47.520]  in the wall. You use like a mofie battery pack and plug it in. So, and you're going to be able to do
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:55.040]  that with the MacBook. Mofie MacBook case. Well, I don't know about a case. Yeah, but no, I'm totally
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:01.280]  like I, people were, what was it last week? People were like, oh, Apple is going to allow people to
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.800]  make battery cases for the MacBook. And I'm like, it's, it's standard. It's USB-C. This is the first
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:13.840]  time like this is, this is a, uh, charging port that they, they don't control or own. So I kind of
[1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:19.280]  feel the power user move is not going to be to bring your, your charging cable along with you
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:26.000]  with your USB only MacBook. But the power user move is that bring a, you know, high capacity,
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.080]  Mofie style, uh, power brick with you. And then you have it. Then you don't need MagSafe because
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:38.080]  it'll just be sitting there right next to your MacBook on the table with the, you know, six inch
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:44.480]  USB cable. Yeah, I, I was actually, you know, who, the person who is going to make bank on the
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:51.600]  USB-C accessories is who's going to make a hub, a USB-C hub that also has like a 10,000 milliamp
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:57.200]  battery in it. Oh, yeah. Wouldn't that be great? Like you plug your USB-C into something like the
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:02.160]  size of a current Apple power brick, maybe a little bit longer. And then out of that, you get a
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:09.440]  10,000 milliamp battery, you get a display port hub, you get USB ports. That, that would be a,
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:17.600]  that would be a killer, a killer accessory for me. I'm looking at my Mofie, it's old. There's a new one
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:23.680]  now with, it's much more clever, but I have this couple of years old Mofie juice pack power station.
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:27.840]  And now I'm just looking at it thinking like, well, look at all these sides, they could just fill
[1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:32.640]  it with USB ports. So it'd be great. Mm-hmm. It's like, if Apple can, you know, still fill ports
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:38.000]  while filling its laptops full of batteries, a battery manufacturer should totally be able to do that.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:43.680]  No problem. That's definitely, I think that's the power user move going forward is to treat it
[1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:49.200]  like exactly like you would an iOS device, where, you know, the, if you expect to be running
[1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:54.720]  low on battery by the end of the day, don't assume that you're going to find a seat next to a
[1:15:54.720 --> 1:16:01.440]  wall outlet, bring a battery pack alone. Oh, yeah. Bring it. You know, I'm trying to find this
[1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:10.800]  article right now. Chris, uh, this is named Chris. Uh, Christopher Finn wrote a really nice sort of
[1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:16.800]  eulogy for the power book duo on Macworld a couple days ago. He's been doing this like old tech
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:23.040]  column like, uh, celebrating the history of past Apple devices. And I was thinking about like the
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:27.600]  power book duo was my first laptop and I love it very, very fondly. I was thinking about, man,
[1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:32.720]  you know, it, again, with the, with the cool idea of like the MacBook is probably underpowered
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:38.080]  right now. Um, but you know, if people want to, want to take it to the next level, wouldn't it be
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:42.800]  cool if there was a, you know, power book duo doc style thing for the new MacBook where it's like,
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:46.080]  you plug it in and then all of a sudden you've got all of these ports and you've got a super
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:51.200]  huge retina monitor and everything's magical. And maybe not Apple, maybe Apple is not the person
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:57.280]  to make the fancy retina, you know, retina display, uh, adaptation for the, for the MacBook,
[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:02.880]  but I'm sure somebody might, right? Yeah, I don't know, but I've got, uh, Christopher's article,
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:09.440]  I'll put it in the show notes. It was a cool machine machine. Yeah, it was, I, I mostly liked it
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:14.320]  because it was not a think pad, I'll be honest. God, look at the bezel around that display.
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:22.560]  I know. That's that beautiful, beautiful what five pounds. I don't want to say. Oh, yeah.
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:27.120]  It had bezels. No, no, no, that's those was the screen brightness. Oh, all right. That's right.
[1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:31.520]  Cause you my trick was always like turn the screen brightness down really low and then switch
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:37.520]  from 256 colors to black and white. So you can get like an extra hour of playing escape velocity
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:44.000]  Nova. I think I got like four hours out of that battery once by like keeping it on the lowest
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:50.080]  settings. Oh, God. Anything that docked, it was always a clever. Look at how thick those keys were
[1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:57.520]  though. I know that keyboard was so fun. Oh my God. I had a little props. I'm, I forgot about
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:01.600]  that. I forgot about the little feet. Little feet to prop the keyboard up. I know, I think that
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:06.880]  was before we understood the ergonomics of proper, please to type with our palms up.
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:11.360]  Completely ruining our wrists. Yeah, that removable battery packs.
[1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:17.280]  Oh, that's amazing. All right. I got to link it up. I can't tempted to just read it right now.
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:22.080]  Yeah, and an educated reading on the air with John Gruber of the power book duo.
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:27.840]  Anything with the doc though, it will always send like a great idea and never actually took off.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:34.400]  Yeah. Unfortunately, I see I feel like in the handoff era, that would be so cool where you're
[1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:39.360]  just like even even you just plugged your USB-C MacBook in the eye. Oh, I guess it does this
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:45.520]  all wirelessly at this point. I don't have to plug anything. I don't have to plug my MacBook into
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:51.840]  my Mac because all of the things here, I can mostly get on my computer via handoff or I can get
[1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:57.120]  everything from Dropbox directly. I don't keep any files on my MacBook Air. My MacBook Air has
[1:18:57.120 --> 1:19:04.880]  like a tiny little SSD and then everything I just store in Dropbox and I just grab what I want.
[1:19:04.880 --> 1:19:10.640]  And then you have the air set up not to mirror your entire draw. It's selective sync. So I have
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:15.440]  like my work files and then occasionally I'll pull over like if I'm working on a music project or
[1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:19.760]  a roller derby stuff, I have like that specific folder synced. But everything else is just
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:25.200]  if I need it, I'll download it somewhere else. Yeah. That's the killer. That was like the level up
[1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:31.120]  for Dropbox that made it like infrastructure. Oh, yeah. It's because then you could use it on
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:36.160]  in scenarios like that where you can't mirror it all. And unconversely, you can then use it in
[1:19:36.160 --> 1:19:41.200]  other scenarios. Like if you have a big, big eye Mac on your desk and all of your photos are,
[1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:45.760]  you know, it's like a humongous, you know, terabyte collection of photos, you can put them on Dropbox
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:50.800]  and not worry about what it's going to do to your SSD in your MacBook. Oh, yeah, you don't want to
[1:19:50.800 --> 1:19:56.080]  cry. I think I moved all of my photos to Dropbox last year after they acquired Loom, which was my
[1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:02.400]  sort of go-to cloud photo solution. And I'm not crazy about Dropbox carousel because it's kind of
[1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:07.040]  it's kind of wonky and it's kind of broken right now. But it does allow you to very quickly like
[1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:12.720]  go to years and dates and stuff and just knowing that all of my photos are backed up and away
[1:20:12.720 --> 1:20:17.600]  somewhere and then also locally on in my eye Mac. So I'm like, all right, I like I don't have to
[1:20:17.600 --> 1:20:23.440]  panic about losing five years of photos because hard drive start clicking or SSDs explode or I don't
[1:20:23.440 --> 1:20:29.200]  know what SSDs do when they die. They just turn off. Yeah, I think they just go corrupt. I think
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:33.280]  it's like they just turned to static. I don't know. I've never had one go bad, but
[1:20:34.400 --> 1:20:40.000]  nor have I. Yeah, I think I think it's just like a just like a state of corruption, but they don't
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:44.160]  click. No, they certainly don't click. I never have to hear that sound again, knock on wood.
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:50.320]  Let me take another break here. I want to keep talking about photos. And I want to thank our next
[1:20:50.320 --> 1:20:57.760]  sponsor. It's our good friends at Harries. Harries makes high quality shaving products for men.
[1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:04.160]  You name it if it's related to shaving. Harries does it. They have their own razors that they
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:10.320]  design really nice, nice, half nice design, not blingy. It just feels like a nice thing in your hand.
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:15.520]  They make their own blades. They don't like white label blades from someone named place.
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:22.000]  They went and bought like 100 year old razor blade factory in Germany and make their own
[1:21:23.360 --> 1:21:28.000]  super high quality razor blades cut out the middle men selling right to you. Their stuff,
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.360]  their blades, their refills and stuff like that, as good as anybody else's and about half the
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:38.480]  price of the stuff that you can get from like Gillette or Shek. Just go to Amazon and compare the
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:46.240]  prices that Amazon has famously low prices for Gillette fusion refills or whatever. And then
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.040]  compare them to Harries and you'll see it's literally about half the price. A fantastic deal.
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:58.000]  They've got shaving cream, shaving gel, aftershave, anything you name it, they have it. And
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.120]  they're coming out with new designs. You can go there. If you haven't checked out their website
[1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:04.000]  in a while, go there and check out some of the new designs that they have.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  Really cool stuff. It's, you know, why should it's just a pure internet play. Cut out the middle
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.680]  man. Don't worry about selling stuff in retail stores. Just they sell direct to you and
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:23.120]  pass the savings along. I don't know how else to put it. I'm a really happy customer. I've been
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:28.720]  using them for I don't know, at least over a year. Great stuff. And it's just so convenient that
[1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.160]  you never have to worry about it. You just wait till you're getting low on blades and then
[1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:38.640]  go to their website and 30 seconds later, you've got a package on the way. Couldn't be easier.
[1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:46.160]  Where do you go to find out more? Go to their website, Harries.com. Check it out. Look for stuff.
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:51.280]  When you order, if you're a first-time customer, use this code, talk show. Know that just
[1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:57.840]  TALK SHOWW and you will save $5 on your first order. So $5 doesn't sound like a lot,
[1:22:57.840 --> 1:23:02.960]  but their starter kit is only like 15 bucks. The 15 bucks gets you everything you need to get started,
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:09.280]  a razor, pack of blades. And so you can use that code, get it for 10 bucks. It's an amazing deal,
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:15.120]  way more than $10 a value. So go there, check it out and remember that code, talk show. It'll save you
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:21.280]  $5 and it'll let people know you came from the show. So my thanks to Harries for once again,
[1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:27.760]  supporting this show. A while back, I've been meaning to talk to you about this forever,
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:31.840]  certainly. You had a story. This is the all-way back at Macworld. You did a story on
[1:23:33.040 --> 1:23:39.920]  the Lightroom for iPad. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I don't get it. I've been a Lightroom user for years.
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:45.040]  And I've just, it's like, I'm starting to turn into an old man who's afraid to use new stuff.
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:51.120]  I like Lightroom. I've been using it since 1.0. It was like, I tried Aputure and I tried
[1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:56.560]  Lightroom. And at least back then, Aputure was really slow. And Lightroom was really fast. And I was
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:24:01.120]  like, I'll go with this. And I've been the Lightroom user ever since. I don't get the iPad version.
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:10.560]  Yeah. I feel like it's something that you have to actively insert into your workflow.
[1:24:12.080 --> 1:24:17.840]  And like, you know, some things you just, they work seamlessly with you where it's a pixel
[1:24:17.840 --> 1:24:24.160]  meters, a great example of, of similarly, an app that's both available on the Mac and on iOS.
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:29.600]  And I felt that it was like, it was really simple in Pixelmator. You just, you know, he,
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:37.680]  it's good to do this. And then handoff does that magical Lightroom for iPad. I feel like it took me
[1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:43.920]  a good month to really feel comfortable with it and to really get used to it. Like Jeff Carlson
[1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:49.600]  wrote our, wrote our hands on, I think from Macworld when it first came out. And he kind of encouraged
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:56.400]  me to start using it. And I, I have to admit, I still don't use it all the time. And I still,
[1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:01.360]  like, I'm, I'm still going between Aputure and Lightroom also, to be honest, because Aputure has
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:08.240]  better, better tethering workflow for me in part because Jason Snell was a, he wrote a bunch of
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.000]  Apple scripts for it. But I, I don't know. It's a telling meaning that you're shooting, shooting live.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:18.560]  Um, so like tether, yeah, exactly. There's so many meetings of tethering nowadays. Uh, tethering,
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:24.080]  yeah, you're connecting your camera to via USB to your Mac so that anything that you take
[1:25:24.080 --> 1:25:28.320]  is showing up immediately on your Mac rather than having to take it and offload and put back in,
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:37.920]  um, into a via, via SD card. Um, I don't know. I, I feel like the app is really, really useful for
[1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:44.720]  kind of seeing your library and for editing doing light edits. Um, but it, it again, like,
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:49.600]  like a lot of these is dependent on your internet connection and dependent on, you know, the,
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:54.720]  the closeness of your Lightroom library, where like you can, I don't feel like you could do
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:26:00.800]  everything that, that I might want to do on Lightroom versus on Lightroom for the iPad versus
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:08.240]  on Lightroom for my Mac. I feel like, um, I like the iPad a lot better as a photo editing,
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:15.920]  service or service, a photo editing platform. I really like being able to physically, uh, you know,
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:21.840]  physically highlight areas with my finger, um, and physically be able to like color things in or,
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:29.200]  or change, uh, change dials by sliding like multi touch gestures feel like a more natural editing
[1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:35.040]  experience because I feel more tactile than just pointing and clicking. But I don't, I also don't
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:42.240]  necessarily think that Lightroom for iPad is, um, is the best way to do it yet. It kind of,
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:47.760]  it, it makes me, it makes me question, uh, in sort of an a broader example. I don't know if this
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:53.120]  is where you're going with this, but it makes me sort of question the, uh, just companies in general
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.840]  being like, well, we have a Mac app. We have to be on the iPad and we have to, we have to have
[1:26:57.840 --> 1:27:02.560]  something on the iPad that, uh, that links to our Mac app. And some people do this really well.
[1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:08.320]  And I think Lightroom is a, is a decent example of, of a good adaptation and a good linkage to its
[1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:12.960]  Mac app. But with other ones, it just, it feels kind of throw away. You know, it just, it feels like,
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:17.440]  um, like the company is just like, we need, we need to have a presence on here. Actually, some of
[1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:22.480]  Adobe's other apps are really good examples of that where, um, a couple, a couple of their,
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:28.240]  like Photoshop, Photoshop Express for the iPhone. I, I remember being really excited when that
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:32.320]  first came out being like, yes, finally, I'll be able to have a good way to edit photos. Like,
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:36.320]  it was two or three years ago. And then when I opened it, I'm like, this does nothing. This
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:43.280]  does absolutely nothing that I wanted to do. Yeah. My, my perspective is as like a decided, uh,
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:48.320]  like pro-summer is probably the wrong way to put it because it puts the word pro before
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:54.080]  Sumer. It's more like, uh, uh, consumer with occasional pro dabblings on
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:01.520]  cons, fessional. But, you know, like, I'm into photography enough that I, I still like to buy
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:05.440]  real cameras. I don't just shoot every on my iPhone. And, you know, and I'll spend a thousand
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:10.400]  dollars. I have a, you know, I have a Canon 5D. It's a years old now, the Mark II, but I have,
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:16.480]  like a nice, uh, the 50 millimeter F2 L, F1.2 lens, which was, I don't think it was like 1500 bucks.
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:21.840]  So it lasts forever. All right. The glass definitely lasts. Um, but, you know, I have a couple thousand
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:26.560]  dollars of cameras, which is nothing compared to a serious photographer, but it's a lot more
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:32.560]  than most people. It's an invest, which, which, where, you know, where should I be editing my photos
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:40.560]  has been a dilemma forever? And I photo was never right for me. Um, and Lightroom at first really
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:47.040]  hit a sweet spot. But the, the, the, the problem I've run into with Lightroom is just that it
[1:28:47.040 --> 1:28:56.400]  ties my photos to my Mac. And they're not everywhere. And, um, picture to life doesn't really,
[1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:01.840]  I haven't really, they have a new thing for Lightroom, but it's like because I shoot in raw,
[1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:06.720]  and the lot of the photo upload sites want everything in JPEG, you have to like, you have to like,
[1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:12.080]  export manually, which is way too much work. Like, I'm not going to do that. I just kind of, you know,
[1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:16.080]  I don't spend that much time. I just go through, throw out all the ones that are garbage, keep
[1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:20.720]  the ones that aren't garbage, find the ones that are actually really good, and then maybe spend a
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:25.520]  couple minutes, you know, tweaking them to make them perfect. You know, so there's really like,
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:32.480]  like, I'll shoot, you know, like a over a holiday or a vacation. I'll shoot like 300 photos. I'll throw
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:38.720]  100 out maybe 150 out because they're garbage or duplicates, you know, equally good is another
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:43.280]  shot taken at the same moment. And I'll find maybe a dozen that are really good. And then I'll take
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:48.960]  those dozen and, you know, apply filters and tweak the exposure to make it perfect. And then
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:52.160]  that's it. That's all I do. And then I'm done. I don't want to sit there and like have to pick
[1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:56.640]  which ones to export and stuff like that. So I'm hopeful. I guess what I'm going with this whole
[1:29:56.640 --> 1:30:02.880]  thing is that I'm kind of secretly hoping that the new photos from Mac will be good enough for
[1:30:02.880 --> 1:30:07.360]  all of that. That it'll make me want to switch from Lightroom. Even if I miss some of Lightroom's
[1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:14.960]  expert controls, that the overall flow of having my photos sink to iCloud. And then I, you know,
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:20.240]  all I have to do is start them. And then the start ones will show up on all my devices and stuff like
[1:30:20.240 --> 1:30:27.840]  that. It's kind of what I'm hoping. Yeah, I, so I've been testing the photos beta since I think the
[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:33.440]  first, first developer beta on the phone and the first developer beta on the Mac, which was last
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:44.080]  month, I want to say now. And photos isn't perfect, but it feels, so I used Loom last two years ago
[1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:48.960]  when it, when it showed up, I want to say it started in 2013 and then Dropbox bought it last year.
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:52.560]  And I really liked Loom for exactly the reason that you were describing where it's like your
[1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:56.720]  photos are everywhere, although Loom didn't have photo editing features. So anytime I wanted to edit
[1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:01.680]  something, I had to pull it down and edit it in like Photoshop or something and then throw it back
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:07.200]  up. And that was, that was, that was messy. It didn't have the seamless experience that I really
[1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:13.760]  wanted. And photos comes closest, I think, especially like talking about what, what you really want
[1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:21.680]  out of a photo editor. The thing that really like that really impresses me in photos is how easy it
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:29.120]  is to get a really nice edit from it, where like their editing controls are super simple. If you
[1:31:29.120 --> 1:31:35.200]  want them to be super simple, it's just, you know, it's three sliders. It's like the, the light,
[1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:40.720]  the color and the black and white slider if you want to tint your photo into black and white.
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:45.680]  But there's a lot of, there's a lot of hidden stuff in there if you drop it down. Like if you
[1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:50.080]  drop down the light exposure, you've got exposure highlights, shadows, brightness, contrast,
[1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:56.000]  stuff like that. And on photos for Mac, there's even some more stuff that you can add like a
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:01.200]  histogram if you want, you know, more in depth about what your color is doing. You can add like
[1:32:01.200 --> 1:32:05.920]  sharpening and definition and noise reduction and white balance and levels. So you got, you got a
[1:32:05.920 --> 1:32:11.120]  lot of controls there, which is not, I mean, it's not, it's not as good as aperture and it's not as
[1:32:11.120 --> 1:32:15.680]  good as Lightroom. But I also feel like this is a 1.0 product and it feels to me very much,
[1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:21.520]  I'm a V08 or not even I'm a V08, I'm a V11 where it's like, there's, there's enough in there
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:28.480]  for the con professional that, that you won't feel like you're just using baby tools,
[1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:37.920]  the way that I photo was. My, my current struggle with photos for Mac is that I love the sinking.
[1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:43.360]  I love the editing tools. Favoriteing is really easy. Albums are sinking, which is really cool.
[1:32:43.360 --> 1:32:48.720]  Still no smart albums on iPhone, which I'm kind of bummed by. I feel like smart albums would be
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:54.640]  a really great way to organize certain things like screenshots, for example. And, but maybe it's,
[1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:59.520]  maybe it's too complicated on iOS right now, maybe there, maybe it's like a back project. But my,
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:05.840]  my problem is, I already pay $10 a month for Dropbox for, you know, having a terabyte of storage.
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:11.440]  And I have all my photos in Dropbox. And now I'm paying, you know, I'm currently paying
[1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:16.880]  $4 a month for iCloud photo library and the iCloud services, but I'm sure I'm going to have to upgrade
[1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:22.080]  to the next year. As soon as I integrate my entire photo library into photos for Mac. Right now,
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:28.240]  I have about 5,000 photos. And I think I have like 35, 40,000 photos sitting in Dropbox that I still
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.680]  have to, to integrate into this new library. And I'm a little afraid about how much money I'm going to
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:41.360]  have to pay Apple every month to store all of those. And also there's the, Apple has, you know,
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.760]  Apple wants to make it really, really simple when it comes to optimizing photos. I had a big
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:50.160]  conversation with some of the Apple reps about like how the, that checkbox that says,
[1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:55.920]  optimize only like a certain subset of the photos on your hard drive and how that works. And basically,
[1:33:55.920 --> 1:34:03.280]  it's, it's dynamic. So it depends on how much space you have free and how much space you have on
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:09.040]  your hard drive total. And it opted like it chooses the photos automatically for you based on like
[1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:14.400]  what photos you've opened recently, the photos in your favorites and any photos that you're
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:19.760]  editing immediately get pulled down from the cloud, which is like, that's, that's nice. And, uh,
[1:34:19.760 --> 1:34:23.760]  and I like the idea of having to take it out of the user's hands. But at the same time,
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:28.720]  it makes it a little hard to be like, all right, well, I know I want a specific album
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:34.000]  to show to people, uh, do I have to star each one of those photos individually? Like,
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:38.880]  do I, do I have to copy all of those photos and put them into a Dropbox album to make sure that
[1:34:38.880 --> 1:34:44.000]  they stay locally on my machine versus getting vanished up into the cloud. Do I have to open all of
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:49.360]  them? You know, it's, it's the Apple tries to make things super easy. And for the majority of people,
[1:34:49.360 --> 1:34:53.440]  they're super easy. And it's great. And then there are the, the weird use cases where you're like,
[1:34:53.440 --> 1:34:58.960]  I just, I really just want to know that my photos are here so that I can use them.
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:06.880]  It's a really hard problem because it is really wide ranging. Once you, once you start thinking
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:15.520]  about everything that you need in a complete photo system, everything from import and reading
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:21.120]  all the various raw formats of all the various cameras and doing a good job of that, which
[1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:26.160]  in and of itself is like an underappreciated thing that Apple is doing. You know, how many times do
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:31.360]  you get like a Mac OS 10 update that includes, you know, support for raw cameras? Yeah,
[1:35:31.360 --> 1:35:36.800]  that's like 40 new raw cameras. And you think, I know that there were that many raw cameras.
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:41.760]  Or something from that to all the editing and the smarts of that that you want. And then, but then
[1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:46.720]  you get into the sinking stuff. And it's so complicated. You know, it's, you know, like just
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.760]  think about like with Apple watch, like I know that there's some people who are like, I think that
[1:35:51.760 --> 1:35:56.480]  they've said they've, you know, it's officially documented that there's only 75 megabytes of storage
[1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.560]  for photos. For photos, yeah. And everybody's like, well, that's crazy because it's like, no,
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:04.480]  they're not going to get, you know, not going to put your full size photos. They're going to
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:08.480]  scale them because it doesn't make any sense. That's a tiny retina screen. Why would you have full
[1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:14.320]  size photos? 20 megapixel photos, right? Even like eight megapixel photos right off the iPhone
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:20.400]  doesn't make any sense. It's only a, it's a 42 millimeter screen. You know, you're going to be able
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:25.840]  to fit a lot of photos in 75 megabytes. But how do you do that scaling though? Where does that,
[1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:32.080]  where does that happen? And you know, it's just so complicated. Yeah. And I, well, I feel like they've
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.000]  gotten, they've gotten some of that kind of figured out already because when, when photos aren't
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.200]  stored, so I have optimization turned on for both my Macbook Air and my iPhone because I don't want,
[1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:52.080]  you know, 5,000, 5,000 photos worth of space taken up on my computer. And for all of the photos that
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:59.360]  aren't stored locally, you still see like low res previews. And I have to wonder if those low res
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:05.760]  previews happen to be the same size as our nice little retina screen. I feel like the, what the,
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:13.200]  the 38 millimeter is something like 212 by 300 something. So those are, those are pretty small
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:17.840]  pictures to begin with. So it may just be that like all of those low res snapshots that,
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:24.560]  that photos from Mac and photos for iOS stores by default may be the perfect size for,
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.960]  for retina on, and those don't take up very much space at all. I think those are,
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:35.920]  those are probably like kilobytes. Yeah. So anyway, what, what did your overall verdict so far
[1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:42.880]  on I found the beta from Mac? It's surprisingly solid actually. I am, especially even from the
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:48.800]  first beta. I had a couple of problems initially with iCloud photo library randomly turning off
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.960]  where I turned it on and then I'd relaunch photos from Mac and it would be off and I turned it on again.
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:38:01.040]  But aside from that, it's really fast. Even I've got 5,050 photos in it right now. And the thing
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:07.760]  scrolls ridiculously fast. Like I'm, I'm in the bait. I'm scrolling through it right now while I'm
[1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:13.760]  talking to you. And again, I want a MacBook Air. It's not like, not like I have a 100 cores at my
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:20.880]  disposal or a really high level video card. But it, it's speedy opening up photos that aren't
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.600]  stored. Like I'm going to go back. I don't know. Here's something from CES that's almost definitely
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:31.280]  not stored and it took two seconds to load up from, from online. It does like it's, it's, it's
[1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:39.440]  super fast. Also, I really appreciate how, how well it sinks with iCloud. iCloud's always been
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:44.720]  one of those things where, you know, it can either work really well or it can just completely
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:54.640]  wet the bed. And, and especially, I noticed this, I was worried on a flight back from San Francisco
[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.920]  on the internet was completely, completely failing because, you know, Google Air is either great
[1:38:59.920 --> 1:39:05.040]  or it's terrible. So I was just sitting on my, uh, sitting on my iPhone and playing a bunch of
[1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:08.880]  like altas adventure and then going into photos and being like, you know what, I'm just going to go
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:15.280]  through all the photos I have on my, on my phone and like, delete and, uh, organize accordingly
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:18.960]  because I've got nothing else to do and I've got all of these photos and I know I've got like
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:23.840]  duplicates and things like that. Um, and I did all of this with no internet access and in the back
[1:39:23.840 --> 1:39:27.840]  of my head, uh, and this includes like photos that aren't stored locally on the device that have like
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:31.920]  the little processing symbol on them. I'm in the back of my head. I'm like, is this going to
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:37.120]  accidentally screw over my entire library? Well, it might as well find out it's a beta, right? Um,
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.160]  and it synced everything perfectly and all the favorites that like I queued while I was offline,
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:47.680]  it pulled all of those down as soon as I got off the plane and like reconnected to LTE. And
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:54.720]  something like that is really, really a big market change for Apple at least for me, uh, where,
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:40:00.720]  you know, I, I basically did all of that having implicit trust that my photos wouldn't either
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:09.280]  disappear or accidentally triplicate and I was right. Granted that, you know, that may not be 100%
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:13.920]  of the time. It worked for me. Maybe it won't work for other people. I'm kind of hoping that it's,
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:19.440]  that it's better though. I'm like, I haven't really run into any photo loss problems with
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:23.680]  iCloud photo library and that was my biggest concern because your photos are precious, you know,
[1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:27.200]  that's, that's the one thing that I'm, I'm always super concerned about. Your photos are
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:31.680]  potentially your life. You know, they, they are, I mean, they are. They're snapshots of your life.
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:35.680]  Well, it's, it's true. It's like, and it's like when you talk to people who've worked,
[1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:38.320]  I mean, you even did. So you probably, maybe you have firsthand experience, but you talked to
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:43.280]  people who work at Apple stores. It's like, that like worse part of the job is somebody who comes
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:49.040]  in and has a dead hard drive and it can't be resuscitated and then they, they start to cry and they
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:55.200]  say, you know, my, you know, my husband died a couple months ago and I have my last year of pictures
[1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:59.520]  with them all, they're only on that hard drive or something like that. And it truly, you know,
[1:40:59.520 --> 1:41:06.320]  you can't even overstate how devastating it can be. It really is like the, probably the most
[1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:13.920]  important data that Apple keeps. Yeah, it's, it's incredibly vital digital data and we think about,
[1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:18.880]  you know, old analog photos. Oh, I've got, you know, boxes and boxes of snapshots that
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:24.000]  maybe I'll never look at again. Um, but those boxes are there unless they get burned down in a
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.880]  fire, you know, which is a lot less. It's a real issue. I mean, it should definitely happen to
[1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:35.360]  water damage, you know, you know, it's water damage and fire to huge things for, you know,
[1:41:35.360 --> 1:41:41.040]  archive boxes or albums of photos. Yeah, but those things are less common than hard drives going
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:46.160]  back. Yeah, exactly. And you could argue, well, digital data is a lot easier to replicate,
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.920]  which is true. And it's like the more copies you have with something, the better. But there's
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:55.840]  still that, that fear. I mean, I lost when my, my last big hard drive crash and the one that kind
[1:41:55.840 --> 1:42:02.320]  of forced me to think very seriously about good backup solutions. Um, I did an art project with a
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:07.280]  friend where we went across the country and did a, made comedy and tragedy masks and like
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:12.720]  took pictures in front of various historic landmarks. So we had these wonderful photos of like
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:19.520]  hanging over the Niagara Falls with tragedy, like looking and potentially like, oh, well,
[1:42:19.520 --> 1:42:26.480]  far down is it. And, um, we had like a, we had a digital camera and we took 80% of those photos
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:31.920]  and all of them were lost in that hard drive crash. And I was lucky that we also were taking
[1:42:31.920 --> 1:42:37.520]  some backup photos with like a really crappy like 24 exposure insta camera because we just
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.520]  thought, well, that might be fun. Have some like real media with the digital media when we do our
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:46.960]  exhibition. Um, and those are the only records that I have that that trip even existed.
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:53.280]  Uh, it's, it's, I mean, it's not, not nearly as, uh, as heartbreaking or as, as sad as like losing,
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:57.040]  you know, losing photos of a loved one. Yeah, exactly. But it's still it, you know, it's still
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:03.280]  a mark in your life. Photos are one of the photos and Twitter at this point are like the, the,
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:07.680]  the mark points of where I can be like, yes, this is how my life is going. This is, this is what I
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.480]  did last week. Um, because sometimes everything's are, you know, things are so crazy that you,
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:16.400]  you stop and you forget, you know, the day to day, you forget the funny little moments that
[1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:22.000]  happen in the, in betweens. And I, I really, I love that Apple is putting such a big emphasis on
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:28.960]  photos. I think that, um, if they, if they manage to make this work, um, I mean, they have,
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:34.160]  they have such a wonderful camera in the form of the iPhone being able to actually, you know, have
[1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:40.960]  those memories stored in an easily, easily accessible place and being able to share them very easily
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:46.320]  is so much better than what it's been so far, which is dumping them in folders and
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:50.640]  taking them with Dropbox and praying that like, oh, well, organize these eventually when someone
[1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:56.320]  has a photo organization service that I don't hate and strategically, it becomes a powerful form
[1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:00.560]  of lock in. And, you know, the cynical out there can say that that's the primary reason they're
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:06.400]  doing it. I don't think so. I think that their first goal is let's build a complete workflow,
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:13.840]  everything from sucking in the photos from your iPhone and iPad to, you know, the photos you import
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:18.400]  from any standalone camera you might have to where do you store them, which copies are where,
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:22.800]  and how are they so that you can get them anywhere, anytime, from any of your devices,
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:27.200]  and, you know, do a good job editing them. I think that it's really about the customer experience,
[1:44:27.200 --> 1:44:32.320]  but then once they have that in place and once people can trust it, man, when would you ever
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:39.520]  want to switch to any other device if that's part, you know, your workflow? Yeah, it's not just
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:46.240]  about, oh, I like iPhone or I like iOS more than I like Android. Well, my iPhone has all of my
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:51.440]  photos on it. It has iCloud. It has my, you know, it has the heartbeats that I've sent to my
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:56.800]  husband on my Apple Watch. Why would I want to give that up? And especially, I didn't even
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:01.840]  talk about, you know, the, the project side of photos from Mac, which, like, they've carried over
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:06.560]  the same things that you can do from my photo, but they, they added a bunch of other prints and
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:11.920]  dynamic prints now so that you don't have to, instead of having to, like, crop photos for a certain
[1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:18.080]  size, you can print photos no matter what size or shape they are. So you can print like square
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:23.840]  photos or you can even print panoramas and Apple will, like, automatically, like, print any
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:28.560]  size photos for you. And, like, being able to not only store them digitally, but also have
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:32.720]  the option of having those physical copies and you never have to worry about going to a Walmart
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:38.800]  or a Rite Aid or anything like that or, you know, it's just there. That leads me to a
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:48.880]  serendipitous segue, our last sponsor of the show, our good friends at Fracture. So speaking of
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:46:00.400]  getting analog printouts of your photos, Fracture is a service that takes your photos and prints them
[1:46:00.400 --> 1:46:05.920]  directly on glass. They don't take a piece of paper, print it on paper and then put the paper
[1:46:05.920 --> 1:46:13.200]  behind the glass. They've got some kind of crazy proprietary process where they take frames of glass
[1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:20.480]  and print your photos directly on them. Very much like a retina screen where it makes the picture
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:28.720]  look like it's on the glass, not behind glass. They have all sorts of sizes ranging from the small
[1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:36.480]  to medium to classic to large. Their large one is downright huge. It's like 28 inches by 21 inches,
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:44.480]  something like that, really, really big though. They also have square, square ones go from very
[1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:49.920]  small, perfect for a desktop all the way up to, I think the biggest square size they have is 23
[1:46:49.920 --> 1:46:59.280]  by 23 inches, truly, truly wall size. They ship with everything you need to hang them on the wall
[1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:05.360]  to prop them up on your desk to prop them up on a mantel or a shelf or something like that.
[1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:10.240]  It's all there right in the cardboard packaging that your fracture ships with. Very, very clever.
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:16.240]  It's clever enough just to check them out just to see the way they pack these things
[1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:23.520]  and package them in and of themselves. They have great prices, really high quality,
[1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:28.080]  great customer service. If you go to their website at fracturemeade.com,
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:34.880]  they even have a really cool blog where they show great examples of what people are doing
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:42.400]  fracture and even things like apps, app reviews for iOS photo editing apps and tips and stuff
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:48.080]  like that to get better photos. If you're into photography, it's a great website just to check
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:55.840]  out for the photo nerdery that they get into. Best of all, they have a great deal for listeners
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:48:02.960]  of the talk show. They have a coupon code, daring fireball, all one word. Just type that in when
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:11.200]  you buy and anything you get with that code, you will get 15% off. The prices are already great.
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.200]  Use that code during fireball though and they'll know you came from the show. They'll know that
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:20.880]  you're, that's how you got to know fracture and you will save serious money. The big ones are
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:29.600]  expensive. It's like 125 bucks to get the biggest size that they have. Hey, 15% off on that is
[1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:37.040]  real money. Go ahead and check out fractureatfractormeade.com and remember that code
[1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:41.360]  daringfireball, which will save you some bucks and help support the show.
[1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:47.920]  So here we are, we're an hour and 40 some minutes into the show, hour and 50 minutes,
[1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:55.760]  and we haven't even talked about Apple Watch yet. I have been thinking about the timing of the event
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:02.400]  and I'm still confused why they held it when they did. Because March 9th is just so far in advance
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:09.760]  of them taking pre-orders a month later and six weeks ahead of them shipping. And I can't
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:14.880]  help but think that. I've been talking with your colleague at I'm or Renee Ritchie about some of this.
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:21.520]  And the consensus seems to be that Apple kind of got locked into that date because they expected
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:26.400]  maybe like when they locked in the urban Buena and started making the plans for the event that
[1:49:26.400 --> 1:49:32.240]  they were sort of expecting to ship the watch sooner than they're going to. Maybe like an early
[1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:40.720]  April thing instead of a late April thing. Yeah, I I'm kind of I'm two minds on that's on that
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:46.480]  because on one hand, I think that yeah, they were timing to go for a specific date and a specific
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:52.240]  time and say like hoping that we'll you know, we'll we'll launch for a good a good solid spring.
[1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:57.360]  But then I think is that kind of slipped a little bit when we got Tim Cook saying April
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:02.240]  in in the last financial call I want to say for the watches launch and then they're like,
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:10.800]  well, we've got this. But but honestly, my my real thought is it gives it gives the appropriate
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:16.320]  buildup for sort of the anticipation of the watch gives them time to roll it out in magazines and
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:23.200]  it also gives them a it gives them the time to showcase them in the stores. Not only to build the
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:28.720]  build and put in the tables that they're going to need to show off the watches, but also I mean
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:32.880]  starting April 10th, they're going to have appointments for people to be able to come in and try
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:38.160]  on the watches and play with them and really get a sense for how they you know up till now like
[1:50:38.160 --> 1:50:42.160]  I've played with some and you you were at the September event right and you you've played with some
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:48.480]  um but the majority of the public all they've seen about the watch is a ton of news articles
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:55.360]  and a couple of maybe like 15 second very dark and blurry hands-on with the watches. They really
[1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:59.840]  haven't had a chance to experience it themselves in their hands and it's it's what you know makes
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:04.160]  the Apple stores magical and is always made the magical is that people can come in and actually
[1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:08.720]  like get to see how this product might change their life. And I think giving people
[1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:16.320]  two to three weeks to really get a chance to have some hands-on time and to see what you know
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:20.800]  not only see all right what kind of band combination do I want do I want the what the sport do I
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:25.360]  want the watch do I want to like oh go the addition because I'll never in a million years be able to
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:31.920]  afford it um you also really get a chance to to see what it's good for and and what it might actually
[1:51:31.920 --> 1:51:36.640]  do for your life versus you know all of us assholes and journalism we're like this is what the
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:40.800]  Apple watch is going to do for you or this is what the Apple watch absolutely won't do and
[1:51:40.800 --> 1:51:45.760]  this is why the Apple watch is useless this is why the Apple watch is wonderful but being able to
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:53.120]  to sort of have a little bit of time to play with it yourself and be like oh oh I see how useful
[1:51:53.120 --> 1:52:02.720]  this is oh Siri actually works yeah I mean it's definitely multi variable I mean retail's
[1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:08.400]  definitely part of it hype is definitely part of it publicity is definitely part of it I think even
[1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:14.320]  the editorial schedule of fashion magazines is part of it because they have a longer lead time
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:22.080]  but I've been thinking about it and I definitely detect I mean I wasn't at the event last week
[1:52:22.080 --> 1:52:28.960]  but just from what I can tell from the outside and from the small bits of communication I've had
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:35.520]  with with Apple you know in the last few weeks about the lead up to Apple watch and just from what
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:47.280]  I've seen is that they're doing you know a full court press on Apple watch that to me they only
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:57.120]  really bring out this this level of of publicity and hype and PR emphasis for brand new products
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:02.720]  and they don't really do brand new products that often I mean the last 10 years there's only
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:11.840]  three the iPhone in 2007 the iPad in 2010 and now this the watch in 2015 and I just I get the
[1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:18.080]  feeling that the difference is that they when you already have momentum and iPads are already
[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:23.120]  selling and iPhones are already selling then you can just say new iPhone and you can assume they
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:27.200]  know what an iPhone is and you just tell them well here's the stuff that's new and better in the
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:35.280]  new one whereas with something altogether new like watch they really feel like they have to do an
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:42.880]  extra amount of effort just to get the baseline level of consumer interest up and
[1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:47.840]  peaked at the right time for when they're going to start taking orders and start letting people
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:53.200]  into the stores absolutely I mean you look at you look at the sheer amount of press that Tim Cook
[1:53:53.200 --> 1:53:58.480]  alone is doing and the interviews that he's given every single interview there's at least one
[1:53:58.480 --> 1:54:02.880]  moment where someone's like are you wearing the Apple watch and he's like yes I am and then proceeds
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:08.000]  to do a quick like two minute demo of something cool on it and it's every time it's a slightly
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:13.760]  different you know demo it's not he doesn't do the same like I can check my calendars I can play
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:17.920]  I can Apple pay you know I think about the first one I think the first one was Charlie Rose
[1:54:17.920 --> 1:54:23.520]  is that was that right the PBS one yeah where he spent like two or three minutes and he did show
[1:54:23.520 --> 1:54:28.240]  off Apple pay and that one and then each subsequent one like Goldman Sachs he talked about like
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:32.800]  why it was useful for him and there was that most the fast company article that came out what
[1:54:32.800 --> 1:54:38.480]  yesterday or this morning that uh where he's talking about the watch glances and every it always
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:45.040]  feels I really admire Tim Cook in that way for the very subtle way he's able to do product
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:49.840]  marketing demos without making them feel like product marketing demos I don't know whether it's
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:55.920]  the way that he presents himself or just the like it's a very casual way of like oh I'm taught
[1:54:55.920 --> 1:55:00.400]  you know oh the watch this old thing yeah let me talk about this and before you know it I've
[1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.200]  given you a three minute demo and you you just think I'm talking about myself and like what I'm
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:09.920]  doing it's it's really smart I don't think it's any coincidence that Johnny I've
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:16.560]  has done more press in the last two three months than the rest of his year combined the rest
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:20.800]  of his career I should say combined of course I well I mean you think there are a lot of things
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:27.840]  writing on this right it's the first major post-Steve new product launch I mean I think that
[1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:33.280]  Tim Cook and his team has done an incredible job and you know in jobs as absence but it's still
[1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:39.520]  like this is this is their first product and and I'm actually like I'm proud of the press
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:46.400]  for not being like the first post jobs you know like making such a such a big deal of it
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:51.120]  but I definitely like it's got to be weighing on them a little bit to be like we have to make
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:55.200]  this is an excess and we have to be sure that this really this launch is out the door like
[1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:03.200]  gangbusters and it's also the you know how many I haven't worn a watch in ten years a lot of
[1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:10.640]  people I know or you know watches watches are not a daily daily wear item like they used to be
[1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:16.560]  and smart watches especially I have not you know up until I tried on the 38 millimeter Apple
[1:56:16.560 --> 1:56:22.160]  watch there was not a single smart watch on the market that would fit my wrist like and a smart
[1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:28.080]  watches just aren't like weren't targeted towards women at all like not even not even like in a
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:34.080]  misogynistic like oh no women for smart watches but it's just like no one was thinking about small
[1:56:34.080 --> 1:56:40.240]  wrists and how a small like how a smart watch screen might work on a small wrist and Apple was the
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:45.120]  first one you know that the Apple watches the first one at least for me where I'm like oh this not
[1:56:45.120 --> 1:56:49.760]  only fits on my wrist but it's still functional I can still do things on it it's not like they've
[1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:55.600]  squished the screen down so far that you know it's now impossible to use even though it it it looks
[1:56:56.240 --> 1:57:00.720]  semi-nice so it's you know I think they're facing the wearable issue too like everybody needs a
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:06.080]  phone everybody was going to be a smartphone a tablet's a bigger one but I know it's just a few
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:13.840]  millimeters but a few millimeters here a few millimeters there and at this size it makes a big
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:21.360]  difference I think that the the the highest praise design for a smart watch to date at least one
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:27.440]  that got a lot of mass market attention is the Moto 360 aka the Moto 270 because it has the flat
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:33.920]  bottom on the round screen and I don't really particularly care for it but I think that you know
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:40.080]  it's a lot of people have have praised the design but in the grand scheme of things it's a
[1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:49.600]  relatively large watch yes and the first person who I've seen wearing it was Andy and Adco
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:53.920]  did you see it at the at the September event because that's when I saw Andy's watch was actually
[1:57:53.920 --> 1:57:58.720]  right right before we went in the doors for the Apple event and I was actually like hey Andy I've
[1:57:58.720 --> 1:58:04.320]  heard good things about this can you take this off and can I put it on for a second and he gives
[1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:11.280]  the Moto to me and I put it on my wrist and the watch face itself the 360 to 70 you know is
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:17.200]  actually physically larger than the diameter of my wrist like there were there are parts hanging off
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:23.840]  each side and at that point I was just kind of like yeah it's it's a pretty watch on you Andy but
[1:58:23.840 --> 1:58:29.200]  um like this this would basically look like I'm carrying around half a handcuff I think the bottom
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:35.760]  line is that the more we learn about Apple watch and the more we kind of get a sense of it is
[1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:46.400]  that it it's like you I feel like you can't overstate just how ambitious it is as a platform
[1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:52.080]  it's not just telling the time and getting your text notifications on your wrist at the same time
[1:58:52.080 --> 1:58:59.920]  it's a real platform and there is an inherent complexity to anything that ambitious
[1:59:00.640 --> 1:59:04.880]  and I don't know that it's a problem because I feel like the main things you're going to want to do
[1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:09.760]  you'll be able to figure out you're going to be able to figure out how to adjust your watch
[1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:12.880]  face and pick the one that you want and you're going to be able to pick out the complications you
[1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:19.600]  want on the watch face but I don't think it's quite as simple as the iPhone was in 2007 the iPhone
[1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:24.720]  you hit the home button and there were I think it was 13 apps that were right there on the home
[1:59:24.720 --> 1:59:32.080]  screen and those 13 apps on the home screen gave you a quick one screen overview of the scope
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:35.600]  of what you could do with the app and just the names of the apps would let you know what they were
[1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:41.200]  I don't think Apple watch has that many more apps but it's more and there are a couple of other
[1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:47.440]  contextual modes that the original iPhone didn't have like glances and notification center
[1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:52.400]  that give you a little bit of extra complex complexity in terms of where are you and how do you get
[1:59:52.400 --> 1:59:58.560]  back to where you were and I in some sense I think it's almost more like a Mac in that sense of not
[1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:06.320]  being a problem insofar as that you can be a Mac user and not have explored the entire system
[2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:12.480]  and used every app and it doesn't mean that the Mac is too complex or too complicated because
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:18.160]  you're able to figure out the things you really want to do absolutely so I went to the Apple
[2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:22.720]  watch page out of curiosity and I was like all right how many how many default apps are there
[2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:28.080]  and if you're if you're not counting the clock functions there are 16 and if you count the alarm
[2:00:28.080 --> 2:00:34.880]  stopwatch timer and world clock you get 20 total so you've got you know seven more apps off the
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:44.080]  bat it still I mean overall you've got a very similar similar build to the original phone in terms
[2:00:44.080 --> 2:00:50.400]  of like messages SMS phone mail calendar but you've got two apps dedicated to the exercise portion
[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:53.760]  which you were just talking about and I think that's that's going to be really key for the watch
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:58.400]  especially we didn't really touch on research kit but it's something that really sort of made
[2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:03.840]  an impression to me during the event the idea that you know Apple Apple's not only going to build
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.880]  this revolutionary technology but they're actually going to put this revolutionary technology to work
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:15.280]  at making our lives not only better but potentially longer by using all this integrated
[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:20.800]  stuff that they've been putting together over the last two or three years but yeah you've got
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:27.360]  you've got maps past book and Siri which of course are new in the last couple years camera remote
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:34.960]  which hooks directly into your phone you or Apple TV remote which I'm excited to actually see
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:39.600]  and play with like there's there's so much more at such a more mature as you were saying it's a
[2:01:39.600 --> 2:01:47.760]  more mature product I think that it's Apple has Apple's learned from its its successes its failures
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:54.720]  its mistakes it's it's you know wins the fact that they're you know watch kit is still a very
[2:01:54.720 --> 2:02:00.000]  rudimentary and it it is built you know their extensions basically they're not full apps
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:05.440]  and I don't even know yet whether or not like third party apps will be able to really run on the
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:11.280]  on the app if or on the on the watch if your phone is not in Wi-Fi range I don't know if that's
[2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:15.440]  that's something that you can do with current watch apps watch kit apps but but the fact that
[2:02:15.440 --> 2:02:20.320]  there are watch kit apps at all for the first generation of that will watch is huge the fact that
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.280]  people have been able to develop for them since November is huge and the fact that Phil Schiller
[2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:30.480]  basically said this is step one and full native watch apps are going to be coming soon
[2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:37.200]  like that they're they're clearly I mean there's there's a lot of thought that's been put into
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:43.760]  this this launch yeah just today in the fast company article the interview with Tim Cook with
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:52.080]  the authors of becoming Steve Steve Jobs Brent Schlender and Rick Tedzelly Tim Cook specifically
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:58.960]  mentioned the difference between iPhone launching without an app store a year out from an app store
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:08.720]  and Apple watch launching with an SDK that came out months in advance and maybe not full
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:15.920]  fledged apps but watch you know with third party developer support right there on day one and you
[2:03:15.920 --> 2:03:20.720]  know they're already promoting these apps third party apps before the watch is even out and just
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:27.360]  how different that is how much more fully formed this platform is at this point than iPhone was in
[2:03:27.360 --> 2:03:35.280]  in 2007 especially Tim Cook's fast company article I just it really it really spoke to me
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:43.200]  Cook throughout the article really emphasizes that the watch couldn't have been made without
[2:03:43.200 --> 2:03:50.480]  Apple's culture and without Apple's sort of big picture focus on what did you say that not
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.840]  living in a small box and he says it's you know a thing a thing from Steve about you know putting
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:04:00.720]  your dent in the universe but that that comes up repeatedly throughout the article about you know not
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:06.640]  put like operating as if you do not have limits and you know if you run into limits acknowledging
[2:04:06.640 --> 2:04:12.080]  them and then moving past them and really you know believing that you can you know that you
[2:04:12.080 --> 2:04:18.960]  can work and live and build in a world where you're not you're not boxed in you're not limited
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:26.240]  by outside factors you know I feel like that that's a that's a philosophy that can occasionally
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:34.080]  you know go a go a really bad way but with the watch it really does feel like they like always
[2:04:34.080 --> 2:04:39.600]  Apple took their time they step back and they said all right let's you know let's really
[2:04:39.600 --> 2:04:44.160]  machine this thing within an inch of its life let's make sure that you know what we're releasing
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:49.120]  is the absolute best product that we are most proud to put you know our names on because yeah
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:53.040]  you're absolutely right they could have released a watch last year and it could have been barebones
[2:04:53.040 --> 2:04:57.840]  and it probably you know you probably would have outsold the pebble two to one but you talk about
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:04.240]  you know when you look at you know the the most recent Samsung Galaxy the S6 phone right it's at
[2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:09.760]  this point Apple has Apple has become a company that everybody looks to whether or not they put
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:16.560]  out a gang buster blockbuster product or just a incremental revision people look to them people you
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:22.960]  know copy innovate build off of their ideas and if they had put out you know if they had put out
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:28.880]  Apple watch version point five with no app store and with limited apps they they probably
[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.840]  still would have had the basic design down they would have had the digital crown they would have
[2:05:31.840 --> 2:05:37.440]  had the button and then you know the the then they'd have to not only deal with their own
[2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:41.120]  internal struggle of being like all right well we need to make this super you know we need to
[2:05:41.120 --> 2:05:45.200]  make this even better we need to figure out how a way to elevate this but then they also would
[2:05:45.200 --> 2:05:50.480]  have to deal with the competition trying to copy the few things that made it unique in the first
[2:05:50.480 --> 2:06:00.160]  place. Do you see this article last week Greg Koenig wrote it how Apple makes the watch
[2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:07.600]  it's just great speculation I mean he admits it's speculation just but based on those three
[2:06:07.600 --> 2:06:11.760]  videos that Apple put out with how they work with the aluminum how they work with stainless steel
[2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:18.640]  how they work with gold and looking at the processes that they're used the the the milling the
[2:06:19.920 --> 2:06:24.960]  smelting whatever you want to call it and just talking about the details and Greg knows what he's
[2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:30.800]  doing he's I've known him for years through he works with my friend Duncan Davidson on Lumaloop
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:37.520]  these great custom made high-end camera slings you know and you put him around your chest and you
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:43.120]  can attach your camera to them and Greg's the guy who designs all the the little pieces the
[2:06:43.120 --> 2:06:48.240]  connectors the O-rings you know the everything that goes on at the metal so he knows what he's talking
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:51.840]  about when it comes to working with metals like aluminum and steel and stuff like that and making
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:57.680]  high-quality stuff and I thought one of the point his whole article is great I'll put it in the
[2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:02.880]  show notes but the point that he makes that I thought really stood out is that the smaller the
[2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:12.720]  device the more the attention to detail matters in the market and I've thought that firsthand having
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:17.760]  seen these watches in September that no matter how good Apple's product photography is and their
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:23.600]  product photography is you know top of the line it's as good as anybody's no product shot really
[2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:31.440]  does justice to how good these Apple watches look in person when you feel them in your hand and
[2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:37.040]  you look at them and your own eyes close up the attention to detail is really really great and I
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:42.400]  think you need that that firsthand experience which means going into an Apple retail store or some
[2:07:42.400 --> 2:07:47.120]  other place where they sell them to see it and to get excited about buying it and I think Apple knows
[2:07:47.120 --> 2:07:54.720]  this it's it's just as beautiful a piece of jewelry as it is a smartwatch and I think that I mean
[2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:58.960]  you you take Mark Newsom and Johnny Ivan you put them in a room together obviously they're going to
[2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:05.360]  make something something gorgeous something that you'd be proud to to wear on your wrist but the fact
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:12.400]  that they were able to do this and include you know watch OS you know include iOS include all of
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:18.000]  this all of the extra stuff and make it look just as beautiful in your hand as it is when you're
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.640]  actually physically interacting with the the display it's it's absolutely incredible on those bands
[2:08:22.640 --> 2:08:26.240]  that was another thing that I really noticed in April is I didn't get a chance to play with a lot of
[2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:32.320]  the bands in September I think I you know I tried on the sport and I had to me two minutes with it
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.640]  if that so it's like pink sport band okay this is really nicely built for a sport band but in April
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:44.000]  I got a chance or in April and in March I got a chance to play with I got a chance to see the
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:50.480]  leather band and the both the modern buckle and the classic buckle and I got a chance to try the
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:56.160]  millenace loop which I thought I was going to absolutely hate because I'm not a I'm like I'm not a fan of
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:02.800]  metal bands they're cold you know they they get caught in your your hair and I put that on and I'm
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:06.720]  like oh my god I like I was planning on getting a leather band and now I have to completely
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:12.880]  reevaluate my whole my whole play because they're those bands are beautiful I mean yeah I got to try
[2:09:12.880 --> 2:09:17.120]  the millenace back in September and I remember thinking I wouldn't like it because I like to wear
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:24.240]  my watch not tight but snug and it seemed to me given that it was magnetic that if I closed the
[2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:30.000]  millenese loop to be snug enough to be pleasant then when I flex my wrist the fact that it was
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:34.400]  only connected magnetically it would slide you know the magnetic closure would slide along the band
[2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:39.200]  and then it would be too loose but that wasn't the case at all it's once you have it on somehow
[2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:44.080]  the magnet for lateral forces it's very very tight and you feel flex your wrist it doesn't change
[2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:49.920]  but yet it's not so strong that if you want to take it off that if you get your finger underneath it
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:55.520]  and pick it straight off that it's hard to get off no it it you really have to try it to to
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:09:59.600]  believe it yeah it's it's exactly like the force touch track that it's it's one of those things
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:04.640]  that I mean I really sometimes I wonder if Apple intentionally makes products where they're like
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:10.080]  you have to come and try it out before you purchase it because we really want you to see just
[2:10:10.080 --> 2:10:15.280]  how ridiculously good it is yeah I don't I think the retail stores are important to everything
[2:10:15.280 --> 2:10:21.200]  Apple sells small big Mac iOS whatever it's been important to the whole success for
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:26.240]  story over the last 15 years I mean people don't talk about the halo effect anymore but I think
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:31.440]  that definitely was what fueled it where people would come in because I wanted to buy an iPod
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:35.840]  and back in the early days they'd even call it the iPod store and eventually they'd say hey I
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:39.760]  like this store I like this people just companies products maybe I'll try one of their computers
[2:10:39.760 --> 2:10:44.560]  and I'll try one of their phones and et cetera et cetera so I'm not trying to underplay the
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.120]  importance of Apple's retail stores in any of their products but I really do think that the
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:53.680]  hands-on nature of will watch and the personal nature of it and the attention to detail that's
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:11:01.200]  only visible at real life distance and size that the watch is the first Apple product where
[2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:06.880]  their stores their retail stores are essential to the success of the product I don't think they
[2:11:06.880 --> 2:11:12.960]  could be doing this without retail without their own retail yeah I mean I don't I honestly
[2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:16.720]  don't think they would have been able to sell the iPhone or the iPad the way they did without the
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:22.800]  store without that Apple stores and just that the the displays are one of the like the multi
[2:11:22.800 --> 2:11:27.120]  touch display when you try to explain to people oh yeah you can do this and you can pinch and you
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:33.440]  can zoom and people would say oh yeah I've used I've used quote-unquote multi touch displays
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:38.240]  before those are those awful things you use at the movies and they scroll and they leg and
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:43.600]  they're terrible and then you actually you know you'd go into a store and try one and you realize
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:49.920]  oh this was you know this is so fast this is instantaneous I really do kind of feel like the
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:54.960]  experience with the watch is going to be very similar where you know again with the with force touch
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:12:01.360]  with with the with the digital crown with you know just all the interactions that you can use
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:06.880]  on the on the watch I was I did this weekend tech last week and one of the commenters like during the
[2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:11.760]  show they have the like the live chat one of the commenters was like you know I was I was talking
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:18.160]  about how I'm really excited to use the use the watch as a driving tool because I hate mounting my
[2:12:18.160 --> 2:12:22.720]  phone because it's just like it's a big giant screen and it's like it's distracting you even if
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:25.680]  you're trying to get directions or something and I'm like oh well the watch is going to be really
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:29.680]  cool because it you know it's going to buzz you while you're you know to tell you to take a
[2:12:29.680 --> 2:12:34.080]  left or a right it's going to do different buzzes so you're going to know like which which direction
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:44.720]  you need to turn and I I really think that I was like oh yeah and then and you can use it to
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:49.120]  Siri to dictate and someone says oh you're crazy you're going to use a watch why would you you
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:52.640]  know you're going to you know you're you're going to do something while you're driving how dare you
[2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:58.080]  know you're being an unsafe person and I'm like how is that more unsafe than looking at you know
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:03.920]  a built-in screen in your car or looking at your phone mounted to a thing it's like being able to
[2:13:03.920 --> 2:13:10.320]  go to Siri and pull your watch you know pull your wrist here to your mouth and say you know tell
[2:13:10.320 --> 2:13:14.960]  you know tell my boyfriend that I'm going to be 10 minutes late because there's traffic on the
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:21.040]  highway and then it either sends that via you know it dictates it or you can send it as an
[2:13:21.040 --> 2:13:26.000]  audio message if the Siri dictation screws up it's like I don't even have to look at the watch
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:30.640]  it just does it automatically I don't have to look at a screen it's it's like that it's just
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:36.560]  stuff like that I feel like it's not there there are scenarios you can't experience or envision
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:42.800]  unless you go into the store and you try it I just don't understand how they're going to handle
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:46.640]  the crush of people that are going to be coming into the stores to look at the watch
[2:13:47.920 --> 2:13:52.320]  there was a report last week that you were going to need an appointment I know they're definitely
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:56.080]  taking appointments where you can make one and come in and get some time scheduled where you can
[2:13:56.080 --> 2:14:01.280]  try on various versions and now they're saying you don't need an appointment but if you don't
[2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:04.560]  have one you know you might have to wait and so I get the feeling that it's sort of like a
[2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:08.880]  hair salon where it's like they'll take you if you're walking but you know appointments are
[2:14:08.880 --> 2:14:14.480]  are highly recommended and I think apartments are highly recommended here yeah I will I imagine
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:20.800]  it's going to be very similar to our to the press demo hands-ons where you know it's a crush of
[2:14:20.800 --> 2:14:26.000]  people in that demonstration area and the reps were basically like all right we're going to you know
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:31.600]  that those of you who are just you know plebeians who happen to be writing for tech you know random
[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:35.840]  tech blog you you'll get five minutes and if you happen to be from the Wall Street Journal maybe
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:39.680]  you'll get like 10 minutes and if you're a celebrity we'll we'll give you like a full 15 minute
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:44.000]  tour of the watch in several different bands and like what you can do with it weren't there
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  celebrities there well Christy Turlington was walking around in the hands-on area and there were
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:54.160]  definitely it was a fun game to play during the event being like all right press Apple engineer
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:58.560]  or fashion model there were definitely a lot of a lot of people from the fashion industry
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.720]  there who are VIPs and there weren't like there weren't any overt celebrities there that I could
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:10.720]  that I could recognize but I'm also very bad at the celebrity face game so back in September there
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:16.880]  were definitely celebrities oh yeah like I remember I mean what Stephen Fry was there is that right
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:24.560]  yeah and a couple couple other people um so it's like I'm not I'm not surprised by that at all
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:29.520]  but in terms of yeah how the how the tables are I mean they had the the retail store tables
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:34.480]  at the event which is actually really cool they have a tables that can only be opened by like
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:39.360]  an employee badge so all of the watches are like hidden and built into like secure safes
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:43.120]  that if you have an employee badge you just like badge it in and then the the table like
[2:15:43.120 --> 2:15:48.240]  rolls open and you have this beautiful uh beautiful jewelry store hidden counter of like all
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:53.920]  the watches and their little nestled uh containers it's it is very very chic and very cool
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:01.520]  but also uh you know I I'm going to be interested to see how they can manage the crush of people
[2:16:01.520 --> 2:16:06.880]  you're absolutely right I eat it it seems it seems like the day that you know that that April 10th
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.600]  that people are going to flood and maybe I'm overestimating the demand for the watch but I mean you
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:17.680]  saw like that writer was writers who had the like 65% of people don't want to buy an Apple watch
[2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:27.120]  and I'm like so what you're saying is 35% of people do yeah it it wasn't quite 69% not interested
[2:16:27.120 --> 2:16:34.400]  31% interested they was I think 69% not interested in buying it there 25% interested in buying it
[2:16:34.400 --> 2:16:40.240]  and 6% undecided but even so even though it wasn't a full 31% the fact that it was 25% is astounding
[2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:44.720]  and in other words one out of four people that they pulled said they were interested in buying
[2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:48.800]  Apple watch which is a product none of them have ever actually seen in person none of them have
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:55.840]  used they're probably under informed about what it can do and it requires an iPhone 5 or iPhone 6
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:00.480]  so with all those things if one out of four people Americans once is interested in buying an
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:07.760]  Apple watch if anything I mean for them to spin that as as bad news for Apple or as they called it
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:14.880]  a sign that it might be a tough sell it's astounding because I think it's if the poll is accurate
[2:17:14.880 --> 2:17:20.400]  it's jaw-droppingly good news for Apple maybe the best news in the company's history that's a
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:26.000]  blockbuster product one in four like can you imagine can you imagine one in four people buying the
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:32.560]  original iPhone so anything else you want to talk about no I mean I think we've covered
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:37.680]  we've covered most of the bases I'm I'm I don't know I'm just really excited for for this year in
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:42.880]  terms of Apple products like Apple has so much on its plate right now I was talking about this with
[2:17:42.880 --> 2:17:49.280]  Renee Richie the other day where we're just like when we were trying to decide like we we knew
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:54.400]  that something else was coming at the spring forward event and we were like all right what of the
[2:17:54.400 --> 2:17:59.840]  potential like 12 products like there's the Apple TV thing I guess we didn't talk about the
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:04.800]  Apple TV thing but there's not there's not much to talk about other than HBO and also like clearly
[2:18:04.800 --> 2:18:11.280]  this proves that an Apple TV update is coming sometime down the line yeah there the tell was that
[2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:19.120]  there was the slide at the event where they said starting at $69 starting at $69 starting at
[2:18:19.120 --> 2:18:26.240]  $69 for a device that there's only one configuration but that wasn't a mistake I mean I that to me
[2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:31.120]  is just a clear sign that they know that there's new hardware coming and that they just wanted to get
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:38.400]  this out for the HBO Game of Thrones promotion yeah let's let's get them off the shelves and into
