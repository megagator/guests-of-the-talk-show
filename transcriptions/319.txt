[00:00.000 --> 00:05.040]  Are you ready to go? Yeah, I'm recording. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Excited for later today. Is that you mean?
[00:05.040 --> 00:08.880]  Well, everything. Yeah. I'm excited to be disappointed by this.
[00:10.160 --> 00:13.760]  Excited for everything. No, no, I'm not excited for everything.
[00:16.320 --> 00:18.640]  That seems like too much. That seems like too much.
[00:20.080 --> 00:27.920]  We are recording on playdate day. Yeah. Before playdates go on presale in like a little over
[00:27.920 --> 00:32.880]  two hours. And I cannot wait to buy one. I would like to buy everything. I want the pen. I want
[00:33.760 --> 00:38.720]  I want to live the playdate lifestyle. And I'm afraid that I'm it's going to be like buying an
[00:38.720 --> 00:44.480]  iPhone. Yep. Back in the day. That's what I'm that's what I'm afraid of. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.440]  to you know, I mine mine is getting my delivery for mine is going to be sometime in next year or
[00:49.440 --> 00:56.800]  sometime. And just like buying iPhones immediately at 3am or 5am or whenever they go on sale. It's
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.080]  also the the kick in the pants is always that we've all got friends and we're all on slack or
[01:02.080 --> 01:07.600]  group text. And it's like somebody's going to get in. Yeah, yeah. I was thinking about this
[01:07.600 --> 01:14.800]  yesterday. I was thinking that someday a company is going to come up with the idea of offering a
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.920]  like a half price device that you can get that works for an hour.
[01:19.920 --> 01:27.120]  And so, so you know, when it's one of those launch day things like you try and get the
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.680]  real one if you can't, well, you could get this half price one. And then you could say that you
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.240]  got it and that you played with it and you loved it. But you only have to pay half price for it.
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.760]  But it broke it broke an hour after an hour. It doesn't work anymore.
[01:41.920 --> 01:46.320]  I'm still excited about playdate. And I think I don't want to go on about it because I have you
[01:46.320 --> 01:51.120]  know, it's just pre orders and they're shipping, hopefully later this year, but I'm so proud of
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.600]  our pals at panic. I think this is such an amazing it is such an amazing thing to do.
[01:56.240 --> 02:02.160]  And never never was tweeting I think this morning about like how it was showing slack images from
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.360]  like four years for seven years ago when they were talking about it, right?
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.040]  One of the things about it being slightly retro inspired, and I like they're not all in on retro.
[02:13.040 --> 02:18.000]  It's not like they're trying to emulate a 1987 Game Boy or something. But the fact that it's a
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.600]  black and white display, and it's not backlit, and the games are therefore relatively simplistic
[02:23.600 --> 02:31.440]  graphically compared to today's, you know, millions of colors, OLED screen world is that,
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.840]  okay, if maybe they're a year late, whatever, it doesn't really matter, because the appeal of the
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.880]  thing never had anything to do with any sort of technical specifications. Right? It's not like,
[02:40.880 --> 02:47.360]  oh, now the CPU in the playdate is a year older. Yeah, it doesn't matter. No, no, it's like it's
[02:47.360 --> 02:54.960]  like it's like a NASA launch. Everything was coded to something that was was locked in years ago.
[02:56.240 --> 03:03.200]  And it's so funny. It's like, you know, yellow, it's like, of all the colors, who knows where
[03:03.200 --> 03:07.120]  that came from? And it's like, you can have it in any color you want, but it's gonna be banana
[03:07.120 --> 03:12.720]  yellow, you know? And it's like, I certainly, if I were leading the project to make a little
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.200]  handhold video game player, yellow would not be mine. Of course, it would be some boring
[03:17.920 --> 03:23.760]  shade of gray. We'd have a month-long discussion about dark gray versus light gray.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.400]  And maybe a special edition space gray, you know, very dark. What color is your car? Black.
[03:32.400 --> 03:40.000]  Black. Okay. Yeah. Mine is mine. For 20 years, I had an Integra that was slate gray. And I finally,
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.880]  like five, six years ago, went out and bought an ILX. And what did I get? I got slate gray.
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.600]  It bothers me to this day that we have a very, it's now ancient. We're actually in the market
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.000]  for a new car. We have to figure this out. But because our car is 15 years old, we just don't
[04:00.000 --> 04:08.960]  drive much. But when we got it, they had the perfect Acura TL on the lot. Black. It was
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.960]  everything I wanted, except that the interior wasn't black as well. It was like the, not like
[04:14.960 --> 04:19.520]  the tan leather, but like the dark, like my second favorite interior color, which is like a dark
[04:19.520 --> 04:24.640]  brown. It bothers me to this day. I mean, who the hell knew I'd be driving the car for 15 years?
[04:24.640 --> 04:27.920]  You know what I mean? I might've held out for a month to get the black interior.
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.480]  Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't get, I wouldn't get tan, but, but I would get brown. That'd be fine.
[04:33.120 --> 04:36.640]  Yeah. But that might bother me as well. Yeah. And it's, it's funny how much,
[04:36.640 --> 04:41.040]  even though I don't put that many miles on it, it's funny how much blue jean blue rubs off on
[04:41.040 --> 04:49.600]  a brown. I didn't consider that. It's just ever so slightly blue, you know? And it's because
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.280]  all I ever wear are jeans. It's just everything that goes in my pockets eventually gets stained
[04:53.280 --> 05:01.280]  blue. My Integra got stolen. Got stolen like two years before I got rid of it from, from the train
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.720]  station when I was commuting, back when I was commuting up to Seattle and we got it. And like,
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.400]  and it was gone for like a week and a half. And like the two weeks was like the cutoff for the
[05:10.400 --> 05:13.760]  insurance. Like if it's still gone for two weeks, then, then we'll, we'll send it, you know, we'll
[05:13.760 --> 05:18.480]  give you some money to buy, you know, give you $15 for it to towards the, towards the new car.
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.680]  And and I get this call from the police and they found it like out on one of the islands in the
[05:25.360 --> 05:30.480]  Pacific Northwest. And so I didn't drive like 45 minutes out there and it's in the bushes. It's
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.960]  like all the way in the woods and they tow it out cause the battery's dead and everything. And then
[05:34.960 --> 05:40.160]  they jumpstart it and they get in and it, and it's got like candy wrappers and stuff all over
[05:40.160 --> 05:46.160]  the inside. The stereo of course is gone and it smells like cigarette smoke. And it did,
[05:46.160 --> 05:49.440]  it smelled a little bit like cigarette smoke for the, you know, for like the next two years.
[05:50.080 --> 05:53.440]  But I was so happy to have it back because I loved that car so much.
[05:55.120 --> 06:01.360]  Uh, I've, I, it's always, I've heard that story from a lot of people. I don't know why,
[06:01.360 --> 06:06.960]  but that they've had their car stolen and then they, the police do find it. I think somebody
[06:06.960 --> 06:11.680]  sent me a story about it. It was like a reader who sent me a story about like, uh, it wasn't
[06:11.680 --> 06:16.720]  air pods helping them. It was like the girl, his girlfriend left her phone in the car too,
[06:16.720 --> 06:21.280]  and then find my help them find it. And it's like they kind of found it and called the police and
[06:21.280 --> 06:25.360]  cause they didn't want to go and, you know, confront, confront the people themselves.
[06:25.360 --> 06:28.480]  And the police were like, okay, we'll take a note. And they're like, no, seriously,
[06:29.120 --> 06:33.600]  that we know where it is. It's right here. But it's always, it always seems a little
[06:33.600 --> 06:37.360]  gross to me to get back in, you know, back in the car and you don't know who the hell,
[06:37.360 --> 06:40.880]  what the hell was going on when it was stolen. Yeah. I mean, it looks like the guy was living
[06:40.880 --> 06:46.240]  in it for several days. It was not great. Exactly. I want to tell you, this is one of
[06:46.240 --> 06:50.960]  my favorite companies away, whether it's a trip to the corner store, a weekend away,
[06:50.960 --> 06:54.960]  or an extended stay with friends and family, we're all navigating the current reality of travel,
[06:54.960 --> 07:01.040]  but no matter your destination or style a ways, suitcases, bags, and accessories all come in a
[07:01.040 --> 07:07.120]  variety of colors, sizes, and materials to suit your needs and inspire your future travels.
[07:07.120 --> 07:12.560]  All of the ways suitcases are designed to last a lifetime with durable exteriors that can withstand
[07:12.560 --> 07:15.920]  even the roughest of baggage handlers. Anybody who's been listening to the show for a while,
[07:15.920 --> 07:19.200]  they started sponsoring this show years ago, I mean, at least four or five years ago,
[07:19.200 --> 07:25.040]  and they sent me one of their carry ons at the time. And that's still my carry on. And it still
[07:25.040 --> 07:32.080]  looks brand new. Also, it's black, which might help. But it's still, we just went away last
[07:32.080 --> 07:38.240]  month. And it is still marveling at how the wheels are still great. Everything's still great. And I
[07:38.240 --> 07:43.040]  love the design of their interior, just a couple of compartments, but they've got like this cinch
[07:43.040 --> 07:48.320]  thing, put your shirts on on the one side, put this thing over it, cinch it up, and it keeps
[07:48.320 --> 07:53.600]  your shirts from getting wrinkled. Ah, works works a charm. I love it. All of their products are
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.680]  designed to last a lifetime, like I said, and if any part of your suitcase breaks their standout
[07:57.680 --> 08:03.520]  customer service team will arrange to have it fixed or replaced. There is a hundred day trial

[08:38.560 --> 08:45.680]  That's awaytravel.com slash talk show. I'll tell you what, I know you've, you've been traveling.
[08:45.680 --> 08:51.120]  We traveled, we took a little five day vacation a month ago. I forgot how to pack. I know that this
[08:51.120 --> 08:56.720]  sounds, I know there's a whole bunch of like memes, you know, like, Oh, 2020, I forgot blank.
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.960]  Swear to God. And even my wife who is a truly expert packers, some, you know, by expert,
[09:02.960 --> 09:07.920]  I mean, she starts earlier than like 10 o'clock the night before you leave. Sure. What I do,
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.680]  right. She's actually very good. Almost never ever bitches like, Oh, I forgot blank or whatever.
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.640]  Even she was like, I don't know how to pack anymore. I don't remember what you bring.
[09:18.640 --> 09:22.560]  How, what do you take? Yeah. Yeah. We, well, the bar problem was we took it,
[09:22.560 --> 09:30.000]  we took a car trip, so we took everything, which was not really, so we did a bad job. I mean,
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.960]  the car was, the car was overpacked. And the poor dog was at a tough time finding a place to lie
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.840]  down. That is one way to pack though. You just like open up your underwear drawer,
[09:41.840 --> 09:49.840]  scoop everything out suitcase. It's not a good way to pack, but it's one way to pack.
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.200]  Let me think here. I got some hardware reviews if you'd like to listen to them. Sure. Absolutely.
[09:59.200 --> 10:07.040]  I have the Apple, uh, mag safe battery pack. It's just arrived. Uh, I think literally the
[10:07.040 --> 10:13.200]  day after I've recorded my last episode, but I have it, I kind of like it and I have the anchor
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.480]  competing version. Yeah. I was going to ask if you had something to compare it to the anchor
[10:18.480 --> 10:25.840]  five K whatever, whatever their long name is for it. And here's, here's my short review.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.280]  They're very similar size, but the anchor one is a little bit thicker,
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.880]  but it's also a little bit shorter. And I find that it actually is a little bit more pleasant
[10:36.880 --> 10:41.520]  to like kind of rest your pinky finger under as a shelf while if you're using it, while it's
[10:41.520 --> 10:50.000]  connected, the anchor one is sort of a little, a little neater in size. Um, the, the difference
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.080]  in milliamp hours, which is what a lot of people are looking at where the anchor one is like
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.960]  4,000 something and the Apple one is only like 1500 something. And it sounds like the anchor
[10:58.960 --> 11:06.400]  one has a lot more oomph. I forget about that. That is Apple's been telling people not to look
[11:06.400 --> 11:11.840]  at milliamp hours forever. It's, and I don't, I don't even understand. I forget it. As soon
[11:11.840 --> 11:17.440]  as I learn it, I forget the, the electrical engineering math of Watts and voltage and
[11:17.440 --> 11:22.480]  blah, blah, blah. The gist of it is they both have about the same charge in, in real life.
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.240]  If you're charging magnetically, if you take a dead iPhone and connect the anchor one and
[11:28.240 --> 11:32.240]  let it go, and if you connect the Apple one, you're going to get about the same amount of
[11:32.240 --> 11:38.960]  charge. A mini is going to have get to a hundred percent and have a little bit of left it left in
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.080]  the battery pack. The regular iPhone twelves feel, it seems like this is not scientific,
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.800]  but it seems like you get about a hundred percent charge. And then presumably as most people say,
[11:48.800 --> 11:55.280]  if you have the pro max gigantis, whatever it's called, uh, you get like 80%, but you probably
[11:55.280 --> 12:00.320]  need it less because you have a better built in battery and longer battery life. Um, and my first
[12:00.320 --> 12:07.520]  thought using both was that, Hmm, price aside, the anchor one is like 46 bucks. Apple's is $99
[12:07.520 --> 12:12.000]  price aside, even though it's half the price, I think I liked the anchor one better. Um,
[12:12.800 --> 12:20.320]  it is just, it just seemed like a better shape. Uh, eh, but then I started, it's like snapping
[12:20.320 --> 12:24.400]  it on, snapping it off, pretending to use it. It felt like I liked the anchor one better. And the
[12:24.400 --> 12:32.000]  anchor one has a USB C plug, which would mean you would only need to travel with USB C. Right. And
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.760]  then you could like at the end of the night, when you go to sleep, you could just use this anchor
[12:35.760 --> 12:42.080]  thing as your bedside charger for your phone and plug it in by USB C. And then the other advantage
[12:42.080 --> 12:49.840]  the anchor one has is that you can plug a USB C cable into it and use it as a traditional non
[12:49.840 --> 12:54.960]  magnetic battery pack. So you could charge anything you could charge. If you had like a USB
[12:54.960 --> 13:01.120]  C to Apple watch, you could charge an Apple watch with it or an iPhone that doesn't have MagSafe or
[13:01.120 --> 13:09.280]  something like that. Uh, but then I, in actual use in the, in what I consider the use case for this,
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.360]  which would be like, Hey, I'm traveling, I'm taking a lot of photos and videos. My phone is
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.800]  definitely going to be hurting. I want to keep this battery pack on the phone in my pocket during
[13:18.800 --> 13:26.560]  the day. The anchor one gets pretty hot, sort of uncomfortable in your pocket, hot because I think
[13:26.560 --> 13:31.440]  it's not smart. It just like the iPhone just thinks it's a regular Qi charger. And so the iPhone
[13:31.440 --> 13:39.440]  charges is the same way that it would charge if it was on like a desktop Qi charger. Whereas the
[13:39.440 --> 13:45.040]  Apple one is, you know, they call it the smart battery pack. It is very smart though. It, it
[13:45.040 --> 13:55.920]  it clearly is not sucking power out of it blindly. It seems like Apple's rough algorithm is try to
[13:55.920 --> 14:02.720]  get to about 70% and then slow down. And like once your iPhone gets to like 70% charge, it really
[14:02.720 --> 14:08.960]  doesn't, it, it goes very slowly unless the battery pack itself is plugged into lightning.
[14:08.960 --> 14:15.120]  In which case it's like, okay, sure. A full, full steam ahead. Uh, so if you plan to use it
[14:15.120 --> 14:20.400]  in your pocket, I think the Apple one is, is a better product. I think if you just want a
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.480]  portable battery pack that could do everything, this anchor product is pretty good for 46 bucks,
[14:26.480 --> 14:33.760]  but it's much less intended, I think, to connect, keep it connected, put the,
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.440]  put the combination, the sandwich of battery pack, magnetically connected to the iPhone in
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.160]  your pocket. Cause it's going to get hot. Yeah. It seems like now is a weird time. I mean,
[14:44.160 --> 14:51.040]  I guess things are, well, we'll see what happens, but we're sorting, getting back to normal anyway,
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.200]  but it's a tough time to sell these devices. Right? I mean, I just certainly don't need one.
[14:57.200 --> 15:02.720]  And I've had these, I've had battery packs. I've had plenty of battery packs over my lifetime of
[15:02.720 --> 15:09.040]  using iPhones. And right now I wouldn't, I wouldn't bother personally, but, but it probably
[15:09.040 --> 15:15.040]  will at some point because presumably mag safe is not going to change either at all or radically,
[15:15.040 --> 15:20.400]  or if it does, it'll be backwards compatible for years to come. Right. I mean, it, it would be a
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.080]  gross disappointment if certainly this year, but if even like next year, iPhones come out and it's
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.080]  like mag safe now has a new diameter and none of your, none of your mag safe docs work and you
[15:32.080 --> 15:37.120]  need new mag safe docs, that would be a disappointment. But Apple is generally
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.120]  pretty good with stuff like that. I mean, people bitch about the fact that iPhones still use
[15:43.120 --> 15:50.880]  lightning instead of USB-C, but the truth is over 14 years, Apple has had two connectors for iPhones
[15:50.880 --> 16:00.320]  that the now seemingly ridiculous ludicrous 30 pin adapter from iPods. Yeah. And then lightning
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.920]  and you, you know, there's obviously pros and cons to the idea of iPhone switching to USB-C.
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.560]  I mean, the big pro would be what I mentioned with the battery pack that you could sort of
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.720]  effectively go all USB-C as you travel and pack and just put USB-C cables around your house.
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.160]  But the other advantage of sticking with lightning, the big one is that all the stuff
[16:22.160 --> 16:26.320]  people already own continues to work. Yeah, that was, and that was what I was going to say. It was
[16:26.320 --> 16:29.360]  like, you know, the minute they switched to USB-C someone's going to complain that they have to get
[16:29.360 --> 16:34.880]  revolved or lightning, lightning cables, you know, everybody, everyone's like, why not just use USB-C
[16:34.880 --> 16:40.000]  it's in everything now. And now, you know, someone will grouse that. But I have all this lightning
[16:40.000 --> 16:45.680]  stuff. So that's, that's my review of the battery pack. It's pretty nice. I wish it was black.
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.080]  It is nice. Yeah. It gets back to, yeah. Yeah. I mean, and there's another thing that's probably
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.720]  going to get blue, right? Yeah. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I mean, cause it's probably got the same
[16:54.720 --> 17:01.120]  exterior shell as my AirPods case, which is completely blue. Well, it's sort of, it's a,
[17:01.120 --> 17:06.400]  yeah, mine's blue too. AirPods. I forgot about my AirPods turning blue. It's a little bit more
[17:07.040 --> 17:12.000]  rubbery. It's it's or less glossy. It's not quite rubbery. It's a kind of a weird,
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.760]  I'm not quite sure what to compare it to, but it's not that high gloss finish like the AirPods case,
[17:17.760 --> 17:25.920]  but whatever it is, it clearly looks like it's not meant to go into a pair of Levi's.
[17:25.920 --> 17:28.800]  I mean, they're, they're, they're not going to change the diameter of the mag safe. No,
[17:28.800 --> 17:35.200]  I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing that's kind of interesting to me is it, it,
[17:35.200 --> 17:41.920]  the magnet sticks better when you have an iPhone case on and particularly better with Apple's
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.760]  Silicon cases, Silicon, Silicon. I always forget Silicon. I think either works. Yeah. No, Silicon
[17:47.760 --> 17:53.840]  is what they make the chips out of. It's like, Oh, you're right. I think, right. Is that right?
[17:53.840 --> 18:00.880]  I think you're right. But the Apple, you know, rubber cases, it really snaps well to and,
[18:00.880 --> 18:07.120]  and better than it does to a naked uncased iPhone. It, it has, it has good,
[18:07.120 --> 18:15.120]  uh, pull it straight back magnetic strength, but not very good twisty strength, you know?
[18:15.120 --> 18:21.760]  So it's just like taking an Oreo part. You don't want to pull it apart. You want to twist a little,
[18:21.760 --> 18:28.720]  right? You twist first, uh, uh, or it, including with the numino, which is of course the official
[18:28.720 --> 18:33.920]  same, of course. Yes. Yeah. Of the talk show. Right. Uh, but the side to side angle, it's,
[18:33.920 --> 18:38.000]  it's a little twisty, but you put it, put one of Apple's cases on and it sticks even more.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.640]  And I think it has something to do with, in, in Apple's mag safe cases, the, the battery,
[18:44.640 --> 18:51.280]  the pass through battery is closer to the surface than it is through the glass back of the naked
[18:51.280 --> 18:57.200]  phone itself. Right. I don't know. So yeah, it's gotta be something like that, but yeah,
[18:58.160 --> 19:00.000]  there's definitely, there's definitely math involved there.
[19:00.000 --> 19:10.320]  Uh, my next product review is the fine folks at Logitech sent me their, uh, keyboard cover for
[19:10.880 --> 19:18.400]  the iPad. Uh, so I have the 11 inch iPad pro and they sent me their, their keyboard cover.
[19:18.960 --> 19:24.720]  It's sort of a direct competitor against Apple's magic keyboard, except, you know, the differences
[19:24.720 --> 19:31.040]  you have to, you have to put the iPad itself in a case sort of, and then the case magnetically snaps
[19:31.040 --> 19:35.440]  to the keyboard. And this is the one with the kick, it's got a kickstand on the back. It's
[19:35.440 --> 19:42.320]  got a kickstand in the back, which is, it works very well. I, if you want to keep your iPad in
[19:42.320 --> 19:47.680]  a case, this is a tremendous product. And, and the keyboard, I think is very fine. It's very
[19:47.680 --> 19:53.520]  comparable to Apple's. They, they made the exact same weird layout decision weird to me for the
[19:53.520 --> 20:00.320]  11 inch where the left bracket, you know, like square bracket or curly bracket with shift
[20:00.320 --> 20:05.520]  is a full size key next to P, but the right bracket is a half size key.
[20:05.520 --> 20:09.600]  Yeah. They shaved off that they shaved off the keys on the end, right?
[20:09.600 --> 20:15.760]  Right. But why not just make, instead of making one full size and one half size,
[20:15.760 --> 20:19.840]  why not just make them both three quarter size and then, or at least symmetrical the
[20:19.840 --> 20:24.560]  asymmetry of this bracket keys bothers me all the time, even though I don't type that many,
[20:24.560 --> 20:30.160]  but I do type more than most people because markdown uses square brackets. So I guess
[20:30.160 --> 20:33.680]  I shouldn't say I don't use those keys more than most people. I probably use it more than most
[20:33.680 --> 20:40.960]  people. I was, I was comparing my use of square brackets only against objective C programmers.
[20:40.960 --> 20:47.200]  And then I realized that you can't write objective C on an iPad. Anyway,
[20:47.200 --> 20:51.600]  you know, it's the only, the only programming you could do would be with Swift and Swift playground.
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.280]  So yeah, I take it back. I probably am the number one square bracket user.
[20:56.560 --> 21:00.080]  Anyway, it's a tremendous product. The biggest difference is just whether or not you want your
[21:00.080 --> 21:06.960]  iPhone or iPad in a case, you know? Yeah. So and it's a nice case and it fits well. And it doesn't,
[21:06.960 --> 21:10.800]  you know, it's got to cut out for the pencil at the top. It all works very well.
[21:10.800 --> 21:14.880]  So I am, I am such a, it does look like a nice product and I'm glad to see that.
[21:14.880 --> 21:18.640]  And my understanding is that they, and the bridge seemed to like early on,
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.840]  I think bridge had a little trouble getting the track pad working correctly with
[21:25.920 --> 21:30.640]  iPad OS, but that they seem to have worked out most of those issues or at least all of them,
[21:30.640 --> 21:35.520]  or maybe even all of them. Because based on some reviews from Jason Snell that I read.
[21:36.240 --> 21:42.560]  Yeah. It's called the combo touch. That's what they call this product is the combo touch. And
[21:42.560 --> 21:50.000]  it's a 200 to $230. So it's cheaper than Apple. It has like a fabric cover. I like it. It's a very
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.800]  nice, very nice feel. I feel it's going to wear better than Apple's magic keyboard cover, which
[21:55.920 --> 21:58.240]  just sort of picks up grease stains like the rubber.
[22:01.680 --> 22:03.920]  And now that it comes in white. Yeah. Yeah.
[22:05.680 --> 22:07.360]  It's going to get blue jeans. It's going to get blue jeans.
[22:07.360 --> 22:14.320]  All right. I got to get from you putting it in your back pocket. I got to get bigger jeans.
[22:18.720 --> 22:21.280]  Well, I think that, I think the nineties styles are coming back, right? Like
[22:22.240 --> 22:27.360]  baggy pants. I know I just saw a picture are not far from coming back. I know. I just saw that.
[22:27.360 --> 22:33.840]  I saw somebody, you know, I am of the age now, like where I'm so out of it, where it used to
[22:33.840 --> 22:38.000]  be like, they'd say like, what's in style now. And I'd look and I think, wow, I'm getting old.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.960]  Cause that doesn't look right to me. And now I'm like, I'm like, are you putting me on?
[22:42.960 --> 22:48.800]  Is this a joke? Is this a, is this a gag site? Let me look at the URL. It's like, Oh no,
[22:48.800 --> 22:54.080]  apparently the kids are dressing in sizes, three sizes too large. Like we did in the nineties.
[22:54.080 --> 22:59.840]  My dad used to buy, um, well, he probably still does, uh, suits from, uh, Brooks brothers. Right.
[22:59.840 --> 23:06.000]  Um, and, and, you know, he got, he got into a style and I think the sixties and he never
[23:06.000 --> 23:10.800]  changed it, um, all through, all through the seventies when there was, you know, wide, wide
[23:10.800 --> 23:17.440]  everything. He stayed, he stayed with this, like not skinny particularly, but, you know,
[23:18.400 --> 23:23.040]  certainly not wide lapels and stuff like that. And, um, he kept all those suits for years and
[23:23.040 --> 23:26.240]  just wore them over and over again until they wore out. And then he'd go buy exactly the same
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.480]  thing over again for Brooks brothers. And I'm getting to the point where I'm like,
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.960]  that's actually a really good idea. And then eventually it comes back into style.
[23:34.960 --> 23:37.280]  Yeah. Eventually, like, you know, I mean, half the time you're going to be in style,
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.840]  half the time you're going to be out of style. What difference does it make? Yeah. Eventually
[23:39.840 --> 23:43.120]  you're going to go back and they're going to be like, sorry, sir, we can't help you. We're out
[23:43.120 --> 23:49.440]  because that's, that's a very popular style. Yeah. Right. And they're going to think you're still
[23:49.440 --> 23:56.240]  as a closet full of them. So he doesn't need. Uh, all right. Let me take another break here
[23:56.240 --> 24:01.280]  and thank our next sponsor. It's it's our good friends at LinkedIn today. Many small business

[25:15.760 --> 25:22.960]  the NSO group thing. But I still haven't written about it because it's like, it's just been hard
[25:22.960 --> 25:31.440]  for me to, to coagulate all of my thoughts into something cohesive. Yeah. But I saw there's a lot
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.640]  there. Yeah. And I but I sent you a link that I didn't see. And I just posted it to during fireball
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.600]  before starting the show. But it's a reader pointed it to me. And I was like, I forgot about
[25:41.600 --> 25:46.960]  that. And yet it was April of 2020. I guess I forgot about it because April of 2020. Yeah,
[25:46.960 --> 25:52.880]  I don't know that I've been something else on your mind. But a year ago in April, there was a story
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.600]  that came out in motherboard reported by Joseph Cox that that the people from the NSO group,
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.320]  the same group that we've been talking about with this amnesty internet national Pegasus project
[26:05.040 --> 26:11.760]  the last few weeks. It came out a year ago and said Facebook came to them in 2018 and wanted
[26:11.760 --> 26:18.720]  to license Pegasus to monitor their iOS users and learn get more insight into what they're doing
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.400]  on their iPhone. Yeah. Yeah. So they basically would have baked this into a product that they
[26:24.400 --> 26:32.080]  were shipping. Like baked whatever. Yeah. Well, I guess this has I guess they didn't want the
[26:32.080 --> 26:37.360]  exploit to take over the phone. They just wanted the stuff that runs in the background to monitor
[26:37.360 --> 26:42.800]  what you're doing like, like what they do after they exploit. Right. So there's like,
[26:42.800 --> 26:46.960]  yeah. But did you you would have to do that? Because you'd have to break out of the sandbox
[26:46.960 --> 26:50.960]  environment. Right? I guess right. Just like Yeah, yeah. So you have to have the exploit.
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.800]  Right. I Yeah, I guess it's, it's unclear exactly what they wanted to do. But it was related
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.360]  to the it's clear what they wanted. Let's clear what they wanted. It's not a clear exactly how
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.720]  they were planning on getting there. Right exactly what sick things they wanted to do.
[27:08.320 --> 27:17.040]  Well, but it was it was from the people who were deploying what the Onavo protect that was the VPN
[27:17.040 --> 27:24.640]  product that Facebook purchase. And which is sort of exhibit a on the list of Hey, be careful with
[27:24.640 --> 27:31.360]  whom you choose to be your VPN provider. Because Facebook bought this product that Onavo which I
[27:31.360 --> 27:39.680]  think was at when they bought it just a legitimate VPN, but they bought it so that they could use it
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.560]  or your VPN provider sees all of your network traffic, right? Could they could get all that
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.160]  information. And that's exactly why they wanted it. And that was the thing that they were paying
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.760]  teenagers to install, like giving them 15 bucks, if you'll do this, so they could see what they're
[27:53.760 --> 28:02.800]  doing. And it was the product that gave them the analytics, or I think it was that that led them to
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.040]  make a big purchase. It wouldn't be Instagram, because Instagram was too long ago. But oh,
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.720]  what what WhatsApp? That's right. Remember, they bought WhatsApp for like, five, $5 billion or
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.760]  $20 billion, or something like that. But so that was based off the information they got from Yeah,
[28:17.760 --> 28:22.880]  yeah, they they were like, Hey, look at the usage of this WhatsApp all over the world. This is
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.200]  crazy. You know, we need to buy this immediately. Look at this. And they're like, okay. And
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.400]  everybody at the time, because I think WhatsApp, which was like, either privately held, or, you
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.760]  know, they weren't a public company, I think they were a little guarded about their usage stats,
[28:37.760 --> 28:42.240]  you know, or even if they weren't, maybe people didn't believe them, you know, they're just,
[28:42.240 --> 28:47.120]  you know, they're trying to sell themselves. But Facebook had data that showed that, you know,
[28:47.120 --> 28:53.760]  Facebook users who they care about were using WhatsApp in extraordinary numbers and paid what
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.440]  people thought was too much for it. And now people think, Oh, they got it at a steal.
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.120]  Anyway, really sick to think about that. It really is. Yeah. I mean, it's
[29:03.120 --> 29:12.880]  it's, it's really just malware. I mean, it's, it's unbelievable to think that they would just
[29:12.880 --> 29:17.200]  put that into a product and ship it and expect to think that that was okay.
[29:17.200 --> 29:24.160]  Yeah, this is the statement in a court filing from NSO CEO, shell of Hulu. Hello.
[29:26.320 --> 29:31.040]  There's a quote, so it is in a court document. So you know, the guys, you know, presumably under
[29:31.040 --> 29:36.640]  oath or, you know, the quote is the Facebook representative stated that Facebook was concerned
[29:36.640 --> 29:43.520]  that its method for gathering user data through Onavo Protect was less effective on Apple devices
[29:43.520 --> 29:47.280]  than on Android devices. The Facebook representatives also stated that Facebook
[29:47.280 --> 29:52.800]  wanted to use purported capabilities of Pegasus to monitor users on Apple devices and were willing
[29:52.800 --> 29:58.720]  to pay for the ability to monitor Onavo Protect users. So I guess, yeah, I guess you're right
[29:58.720 --> 30:02.480]  that they did want exploits there. They were saying that I guess that that statement. Yeah,
[30:02.480 --> 30:05.760]  I mean, I don't think there's any way to any other way to do it. They basically wanted to
[30:05.760 --> 30:11.920]  get all of that stuff that Pegasus does. Seeing all of your network traffic isn't enough.
[30:13.200 --> 30:17.360]  Right. That's you to see your pictures, we need to see everything else.
[30:19.840 --> 30:27.360]  Anyway, I'm curious what your thoughts are in the larger sense on the the whole NSO group expose,
[30:27.360 --> 30:36.800]  for lack of a better word. It's weird. Like, do you have you addressed the question of whether or
[30:36.800 --> 30:42.480]  not it's cool that these guys are doing this in the first place? No, because it doesn't seem
[30:42.480 --> 30:49.920]  terribly cool. I mean, I get that sometimes, you know, like if there are terrorists, it seems
[30:49.920 --> 30:55.120]  something there are certain situations, you know, you can dream of any kind of Jack Bauer situation
[30:55.120 --> 31:02.320]  you want, where? Yeah, yeah, we want to get these people, you know, like, if we want to save a bunch
[31:02.320 --> 31:09.280]  of people's lives and stuff like that, but these guys are not really they're not they're not caring
[31:09.280 --> 31:18.640]  who they're selling it to particularly. They are selling it to nation states that are using it
[31:18.640 --> 31:26.560]  against dissidents, using it against members of political parties that are not, you know,
[31:26.560 --> 31:34.400]  not in power, and members of minority groups that are being persecuted, and journalists who are
[31:34.400 --> 31:41.760]  reporting on this stuff. So it's like, while I think that, yeah, maybe there is a case to be made
[31:41.760 --> 31:51.840]  for this. Using these exploits in these ways, NSO group does not seem to be careful enough to be
[31:54.160 --> 32:00.720]  putting, putting it behind the right actors. It's, it is, it's like they, they're, they're,
[32:01.520 --> 32:06.320]  their list of countries they won't sell to are, you know, lots of countries, you know, they're not
[32:06.320 --> 32:10.000]  they don't sell to China, they don't sell to Russia, they don't sell to, you know, countries
[32:10.000 --> 32:21.920]  that are accused of outright authoritarianism. But it's like the countries they do sell to,
[32:21.920 --> 32:27.440]  it's, it's no, but no country, including the United States, you know, certainly not. I mean,
[32:27.440 --> 32:32.400]  we, you know, you can, you can watch, you can lose yourself watching documentaries about the
[32:32.400 --> 32:39.680]  morally corrupt ways, the things the CIA has done around the world, right? 20th century.
[32:39.680 --> 32:44.880]  Well, if this, you know, if smartphones were around in the late 60s, they certainly would
[32:44.880 --> 32:49.920]  have used this against Martin Luther King. Right? Yeah, the FBI to, you know, domestically,
[32:50.480 --> 32:56.800]  internationally, you know, it's, but it's the nature of being in counterintelligence,
[32:56.800 --> 33:02.880]  you know, and I'm not saying it's the nature for the domestic law enforcement to
[33:04.000 --> 33:09.680]  monitor Martin Luther King, you know, that's obviously wrong, and was terrible. But
[33:11.680 --> 33:16.080]  even in an ideal situation, they're going to, they're going to find themselves in morally
[33:16.960 --> 33:22.560]  moral gray zones, in terms of what it's the nature of being a spy agency.
[33:22.560 --> 33:28.960]  And you multiply that by selling it around the world, and the, you know, the chance that it's
[33:28.960 --> 33:35.360]  going to be misused is like 100%. I mean, like, Macron was, was apparently attacked, or his phone
[33:35.360 --> 33:39.680]  number might have been on the list, you know, the actual, the, what's his title? Is he the
[33:39.680 --> 33:44.240]  president of France? I forget if they have a prime minister or president. I forget that too.
[33:44.240 --> 33:54.880]  We'll call him president. That sounds right. Yeah. And that's the part that I still find so
[33:54.880 --> 34:02.880]  strange about this is I'm not quite sure I don't get why Israel, a country with excellent, you
[34:02.880 --> 34:11.680]  know, intelligence agencies, and that punches way above its weight population wise militarily,
[34:11.680 --> 34:18.000]  thanks to it, you know, ally ship with the United States. I don't get why they let NSO group do
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.240]  this. Why don't they just sort of conscript them and say, you know, this, your technology is too,
[34:24.240 --> 34:28.960]  too good, too important. We need to keep this to ourselves. Why Why do they even let them sell it
[34:28.960 --> 34:38.320]  around the world? I would imagine at some point, once you develop a sophisticated and well healed
[34:38.320 --> 34:47.600]  intelligence organization within your, within your government, those people eventually quit,
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.000]  they eventually go out. And what do they know? That's what they know. So they start up their
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  own business. Right. And then that and that kind of thing perpetuates, right. And you have to,
[34:58.000 --> 35:04.720]  and on the other hand, the other way is that helps build people who then go into the intelligence
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.120]  organizations. And so it's a, it's, you know, it's the same thing like in, you know, Washington, DC,
[35:10.160 --> 35:17.760]  the lobbyists, you know, funnel in and out of the government and end up working for the departments
[35:17.760 --> 35:26.480]  that they lobby. And just it's, it's makes its it makes its own ecosystem. Well, and it's the
[35:26.480 --> 35:32.560]  same thing with lobbying, what do you think pays better working as a high level analyst for the
[35:32.560 --> 35:39.280]  Israel State Security Agency or working for the NSO group, where they auction these things off
[35:39.280 --> 35:45.520]  to the highest bidder? Yeah, yeah, which it's, it's, you know, money, right. And I guess and
[35:45.520 --> 35:52.800]  when I say allow, I get it that Israel is a liberal democracy. And like, I'm not quite sure
[35:52.800 --> 36:01.440]  like if you and I were to start the john and john group here, selling NSO group like spyware,
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.640]  like, I don't think that's illegal, we could start that. And it's, you know, there's no sure I when,
[36:06.640 --> 36:11.120]  so when I say why does Israel allow it, I just mean, why don't they just make them an offer,
[36:11.120 --> 36:15.120]  you know, even if it's not like a legal thing, which I'm not quite sure I'm not, I'm not a
[36:15.120 --> 36:20.800]  lawyer, and I'm certainly not an Israeli legal expert. But you know, you could make them an
[36:20.800 --> 36:26.640]  offer financially, they couldn't refuse to be to nationalize it. Yeah, well, to just take it off
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.240]  the market, because I don't think it's good. You know what I mean? Like, in some ways,
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.800]  it's self defeating, where how does Israel know that, you know, if they're selling this technology
[36:34.800 --> 36:42.400]  to other Arab countries, you know, like Saudi Arabia, how does Israel know that the same thing
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.800]  isn't being used against them that they're, you know, you know, technology developed in Israel
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.480]  is being used to attack the phones of people in the Israeli government.
[36:52.480 --> 36:54.480]  I bet the people who work at NSO don't.
[36:55.680 --> 36:57.200]  I would guess but I don't know.
[36:57.200 --> 37:00.720]  Like I said, I mean, they rub shoulders, they had very, you know, if they are not
[37:01.280 --> 37:07.120]  almost literally the same people who are going in and out of Israeli intelligence organizations,
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.680]  they are rubbing shoulders with them constantly.
[37:09.680 --> 37:16.240]  But they're they say that once they like, give it to the government of Mexico, that then they're
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.720]  they don't know what Mexico does with it, you know, that they they're they're careful about
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.680]  the license it to but then once the law enforcement has it, NSO group isn't involved
[37:25.680 --> 37:28.880]  every step of the way with every single person who gets targeted.
[37:28.880 --> 37:32.080]  But it seems like also this is this is these things have shelf lives, right?
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.080]  Because eventually, whatever exploits being used, Apple is going to find it
[37:38.080 --> 37:38.880]  and close it.
[37:39.760 --> 37:41.680]  And then they have to and then they have to buy another one.
[37:42.960 --> 37:43.280]  Right?
[37:43.280 --> 37:46.960]  I guess, you know, presumably, I guess, but you know, who knows, who knows how many of
[37:46.960 --> 37:47.760]  them have been around?
[37:47.760 --> 37:50.800]  And are you so seldomly that Apple hasn't found it?
[37:50.800 --> 37:57.360]  Because yeah, it's possible, you know, if if I get targeted, and and they send me one
[37:57.360 --> 38:02.080]  of these text messages that I never see, but it corrupts my phone, how's Apple find out
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.400]  that john Gruber's phone was hacked by this particular exploit?
[38:06.400 --> 38:07.200]  You know, and
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.240]  well, I thought that was the interesting thing about the whole thing, right is because the
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.080]  one of the reasons why Amnesty International focused on iPhones was because iPhones had
[38:18.080 --> 38:22.960]  better iOS had better logs, and they were actually able to see the fact that they were
[38:23.920 --> 38:27.200]  infected with this left more malware malware.
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.040]  Yeah, left more evidence behind, whereas they couldn't even do the research on Android.
[38:31.840 --> 38:32.160]  Right.
[38:32.160 --> 38:42.560]  It's it I and and the publicity also sort of works against Apple's interests, right?
[38:42.560 --> 38:49.360]  It's like, you know, by having a reputation for being far more secure, then when there's
[38:49.360 --> 38:52.880]  proof that there's that's, you know, not impregnable.
[38:54.400 --> 38:56.720]  It, it seems more sensational, right?
[38:56.720 --> 38:57.840]  And it's right.
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.000]  It's like, it is a frustration for me with all of these stories.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.400]  It's always been I mean, and you know, this, we've been writing about Apple stuff long
[39:06.400 --> 39:13.760]  enough where that whole argument about the back when Windows truly had like a malware,
[39:15.200 --> 39:17.440]  for lack of a better word, pandemic, right.
[39:18.480 --> 39:24.000]  And the argument was, well, that's because Windows has terrible, it's just terribly engineered
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.200]  and has all these glaring vulnerabilities, you know, where you just double click a word
[39:29.200 --> 39:31.200]  file and you're running code.
[39:31.200 --> 39:32.240]  I mean, this is nuts.
[39:32.240 --> 39:36.240]  And the argument from the Windows side was no, it's because Windows has all the market
[39:36.240 --> 39:39.360]  shares, so nobody attacks the Macintosh.
[39:39.360 --> 39:43.760]  And if, you know, Apple had a big market share, they do be just as bad or worse.
[39:43.760 --> 39:45.680]  And it's like, No, I really don't think so.
[39:45.680 --> 39:52.160]  But now we see it like iOS is is more popular than Windows and doesn't have the malware
[39:52.160 --> 39:52.560]  problem.
[39:52.560 --> 39:53.840]  It is more secure.
[39:53.840 --> 39:59.760]  But it's still a frustration for me that Windows is so it never gets mentioned with all these
[39:59.760 --> 40:06.320]  tax talks of ransomware attacks, which is one of the big tech stories of 2021.
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.440]  I mean, there was a time where it a couple weeks ago, where a big portion of the United
[40:11.440 --> 40:18.400]  States couldn't buy gasoline because a ransomware attack led a company shut down a pipeline,
[40:18.400 --> 40:19.120]  right?
[40:19.120 --> 40:21.680]  Did you see the details about that, too, that they shut down the pipe?
[40:21.680 --> 40:25.680]  It wasn't that the ransomware shut down the pipeline, it was that the company shut down
[40:25.680 --> 40:32.400]  the pipeline, because the ransomware only affected their ability to meter the, oh, that's
[40:32.400 --> 40:35.280]  right, the oil, they couldn't, they couldn't send out bills, right, they couldn't send
[40:35.280 --> 40:38.400]  out bills, they could have kept the oil flowing and kept people with gas.
[40:38.400 --> 40:40.880]  I mean, I'm not saying I would have given away free gas either.
[40:40.880 --> 40:48.000]  But it they were very, they, they didn't, they didn't release that version of the story
[40:48.000 --> 40:48.480]  right away.
[40:48.480 --> 40:52.400]  It seemed that the story that came out was that the ransomware shut down the right line.
[40:52.400 --> 40:59.680]  Right, right. But these ransomware attacks, as far as I am aware, they all attack Microsoft
[40:59.680 --> 41:00.160]  systems.
[41:00.160 --> 41:02.960]  They're all like attacks on exchange servers.
[41:02.960 --> 41:03.460]  Yeah.
[41:03.920 --> 41:09.120]  And it just goes without, it's like, the fact that these are Windows machines and exchange
[41:09.120 --> 41:13.440]  server systems and corporate systems, it's it's it's so goes without saying that doesn't
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.880]  even get mentioned in the stories.
[41:14.880 --> 41:19.520]  But then this NSO group thing comes out, and it's all about how the iPhone is not is not
[41:19.520 --> 41:20.080]  not secure.
[41:20.640 --> 41:21.360]  Right, right.
[41:21.360 --> 41:23.840]  And that was that was the Washington Post's
[41:23.840 --> 41:24.340]  right.
[41:24.800 --> 41:27.520]  Read out headline, right headline, basically.
[41:27.520 --> 41:28.020]  Yeah.
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.760]  Which is, you know, when when you read the the actual report, it's sort of infuriating,
[41:33.760 --> 41:37.600]  because, you know, like I said, it's like the reason they're focusing on iPhones is
[41:37.600 --> 41:39.440]  because they get more information out of them.
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.000]  It is funny, too, that the information they got comes out of an iTunes backup.
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.160]  Yes, SQLite SQLite database.
[41:48.160 --> 41:51.760]  Yeah, I read that. I think I read that like three times. Like, wait, what?
[41:52.800 --> 41:53.300]  What?
[41:53.680 --> 41:54.240]  iTunes.
[41:55.040 --> 41:57.760]  Speaking of the 30 pin connector cable era.
[42:00.400 --> 42:02.400]  It still is cool that you can do that, though.
[42:02.400 --> 42:04.720]  I I'm, I'm happy that you can do it.
[42:04.720 --> 42:06.960]  I don't I haven't backed up via iTunes.
[42:06.960 --> 42:08.640]  I'm an iCloud person myself.
[42:08.640 --> 42:11.280]  But I'm glad you can.
[42:11.280 --> 42:12.320]  And it's a I did it.
[42:12.320 --> 42:13.440]  I did it for years.
[42:13.440 --> 42:14.480]  I did it for a long time.
[42:14.480 --> 42:16.880]  And I don't really now I don't remember why exactly.
[42:16.880 --> 42:22.480]  I think I think for a while, it seemed like when you restored the the backup in iTunes
[42:22.480 --> 42:24.800]  restored more of your information.
[42:24.800 --> 42:28.080]  Yeah, I think you get your pass, like you get your passwords and everything like that.
[42:28.080 --> 42:31.840]  And then I wasn't paying enough attention and didn't realize that Oh, now iCloud did
[42:31.840 --> 42:33.920]  all that, you know, did it like that as well.
[42:34.800 --> 42:38.800]  I was just reading a tweet thread, by the way, and I go through this more than most
[42:38.800 --> 42:42.560]  people because I get all these review phones that I'm setting up.
[42:42.560 --> 42:50.160]  But it's always unclear to me what the best way to up you know, to set up a new back new
[42:50.160 --> 42:55.920]  phone from a backup is because now there's the phone to phone method where you you leave
[42:55.920 --> 43:00.960]  the to you know, your old phone next to your new phone and it just magically transfers
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.080]  some stuff over the air and then gets the rest from the cloud.
[43:05.360 --> 43:05.760]  Right.
[43:05.760 --> 43:10.480]  And I was somebody on Twitter, I'll never find the link but was saying that that method
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.120]  restores even more than just a pure cloud backup.
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.600]  Like if you have certain apps that
[43:19.360 --> 43:21.680]  Oh, yeah, that they're no longer on the store.
[43:21.680 --> 43:26.080]  Well, or no, but there's some apps like I think like Aussie, you know, which gives you
[43:26.080 --> 43:31.840]  two factor code, oh, yeah, that you have to, or like signal.
[43:31.840 --> 43:36.320]  If you use signal the messaging service, you can only use it on one phone.
[43:36.320 --> 43:42.480]  And it's sort of a frustration that you, you know, you could set up like a Mac or an iPad
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.800]  as a secondary device to your phone.
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.720]  So you can use signal on those devices.
[43:46.720 --> 43:48.640]  But you can't set up a second iPhone.
[43:49.760 --> 43:53.760]  That is a signal device you have to you can only have one phone at a time and it needs
[43:53.760 --> 43:54.880]  your phone number SIM card.
[43:55.920 --> 44:00.000]  So every day, if you get a new phone and you want to make the new phone your signal phone,
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.840]  you have to like re log into signal and, but if you do the phone to phone thing it transfers
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.880]  even those apps that don't put their stuff in there in your iCloud backup, they go directly
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.960]  they somehow over the air securely send the credentials from your old phone to your new
[44:14.960 --> 44:15.200]  phone.
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.080]  So I think from now on, that's how I'm going to set up all my phones.
[44:18.080 --> 44:18.320]  Yeah.
[44:21.040 --> 44:23.120]  Anything else on that on the NSO group thing?
[44:24.640 --> 44:30.320]  Um, no, I mean, the only thing that I guess the I mean, it seems like the way these things
[44:30.320 --> 44:33.360]  get fed is by these companies paying.
[44:33.360 --> 44:36.720]  I mean, it's, you know, there's not that many of them, but they pay a significant amount
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.560]  of money in order to get these exploits.
[44:38.560 --> 44:44.240]  And the only way that I think that Apple can improve the situation is pay more.
[44:44.240 --> 44:52.080]  Yeah, I that's I there's an angle on this where and I know the Washington Post, I think
[44:52.080 --> 44:57.440]  bit into it the heaviest that Apple is doing wrong by its platform by being too secretive
[44:57.440 --> 45:05.680]  and not allowing third party security researchers to do and see more on the iOS system, you
[45:05.680 --> 45:05.840]  know.
[45:06.960 --> 45:12.640]  And my retort to that and and one of them even said, had a quote from somebody who's
[45:12.640 --> 45:16.960]  like, you know, Microsoft shows the way here, you know, Microsoft is really opens themselves
[45:16.960 --> 45:20.640]  up to security researchers, and we get everything we need, and we could see these internals
[45:20.640 --> 45:23.680]  and it's like, well, then how come ransomware is still rampant?
[45:23.680 --> 45:28.000]  Yeah, system so I guess not it.
[45:28.000 --> 45:29.280]  I could see the argument.
[45:29.280 --> 45:34.080]  I'm not saying it's wrong, but it's there's clearly it's not as clear cut as the security
[45:34.080 --> 45:35.200]  researchers would say.
[45:35.200 --> 45:36.320]  It's sort of like that.
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.680]  If you have a dentist who says you should come to the dentist for a checkup every three
[45:39.680 --> 45:40.800]  months, it's like, Yeah, sure.
[45:40.800 --> 45:49.600]  You'd say that, you know, you know, it's like, yeah, it's a lot of it's a lot of glad
[45:49.600 --> 45:54.720]  handing. Yeah, I mean, it's it's good. It comes from a lot of people who want to be
[45:54.720 --> 46:00.160]  in the business of making dumb virus scanners for iOS.
[46:00.160 --> 46:05.360]  Right. And that's the other thing, too, is that there's a market for selling actual
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.480]  antivirus or anti malware, whatever software monitoring software, which none of course
[46:10.480 --> 46:16.160]  is far, far not even close, not even near can't even see the gray zone with binoculars
[46:16.160 --> 46:18.320]  as to what is allowed in the App Store.
[46:18.320 --> 46:21.200]  And of course, they'd like to be able to sell it. But I don't think that's the answer.
[46:21.200 --> 46:27.040]  I think it's what you said that they need to pay more. And yeah, the Apple has the financial
[46:27.040 --> 46:33.600]  wherewithal to I'm not saying they can put NSO group out of business, but they could
[46:33.600 --> 46:37.840]  buy pain more for the exploits, whatever it takes.
[46:37.840 --> 46:40.480]  It's a drop in the bucket for Apple.
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.800]  And, you know, they can make you know, if it costs a million, if NSO group considers
[46:46.800 --> 46:51.360]  an exploit worth a million, Apple shouldn't be trying to pay 1.1 million, they should
[46:51.360 --> 46:55.600]  pay 20 million and say, if you've got an exploit NSO group is willing to pay you a
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.360]  million dollars for will pay you 20 million, or whatever it takes.
[46:59.920 --> 47:03.680]  I'm not sure the Well, I mean, I'm not sure they need to do that. They could certainly
[47:03.680 --> 47:08.160]  do that. Because even if you're, I don't know where the obviously, I don't know where
[47:08.160 --> 47:12.560]  the cutoff line is. But even if you're just like, he may not get the person who's who
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.880]  says that they want to make that 1.1 million, you know, like venison group is offering
[47:16.880 --> 47:22.800]  1.1 million, you could you might still give somebody else an incentive if you were going
[47:22.800 --> 47:29.680]  to give them $750,000. You know, you could you might be able to get somebody else who
[47:29.680 --> 47:38.160]  is not willing to deal with some bad actor in order to white hat find your your the
[47:38.160 --> 47:44.720]  exploit the same exploit, basically. So but it's just but you do you do have to you do
[47:44.720 --> 47:47.040]  have to be willing to put a lot of skin on the game.
[47:47.680 --> 47:54.080]  Yeah, and there's, you know, I, I get it that, you know, and they have a bounty program.
[47:54.080 --> 48:00.400]  And the Apple touts it as like the best paying bounty program in the business security
[48:00.400 --> 48:04.640]  researchers, the type of people who, who, I mean, there are people who make a living
[48:04.640 --> 48:10.640]  by, you know, going after these bounties. And it's, it's such an inner, it's such
[48:10.640 --> 48:16.240]  an interesting thing to me to way to apply a rather unique skill set, right? It's,
[48:16.240 --> 48:24.080]  it's such a weird ability that some programmers have where like their special talent is being
[48:24.080 --> 48:27.760]  able to find these sort of exploits and take advantage of them.
[48:28.400 --> 48:31.600]  I don't even have a good idea of like, how it works.
[48:31.600 --> 48:36.640]  I don't really either. I can't wrap my head around. No, it's how this actually happened.
[48:36.640 --> 48:41.120]  Like, zero day. I mean, like, what I don't even know. I mean, I only have a very vague
[48:41.120 --> 48:46.160]  idea. But it's like, just all of a sudden, like, I've got access to executable code
[48:46.160 --> 48:49.760]  and memory. And now I can write and say, What are you talking about? I don't know. Yeah,
[48:49.760 --> 48:54.480]  how do you think about this? But they, you know, they can do it. It's a great idea.
[48:54.480 --> 48:58.480]  But they're, I believe it that there's a lot of these people who are involved in these
[48:58.480 --> 49:02.640]  bounty programs who say Apple's program is a real pain in the ass, and that you submit
[49:02.640 --> 49:06.000]  things you feel like you, you know, you've, you've got it fair and square, and you don't
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.720]  it, they, they pay late, or, you know, they drag their feet, right? They should have a
[49:10.720 --> 49:18.800]  reputation amongst these people having a just a bar none, golden star, you know, right.
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.320]  They are to about bounty programs, what the Apple retail store is to shopping for electronics
[49:24.320 --> 49:29.040]  in a retail store. It's it, you know, nobody's ever going to be fully happy. I would like
[49:29.040 --> 49:36.240]  a register I can get in line for. But but it is the best. It's nobody can argue it is
[49:36.240 --> 49:42.560]  the best. I had one more thought about it. But oh, I know it's the other thing to me
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.720]  that is so fascinating is that apparently the technique that they're using to get in
[49:46.720 --> 49:55.120]  I it the sending a message and then having like a corrupt gift or ping or something,
[49:55.120 --> 50:01.520]  or a JPEG, and having the image processing exploited. It's so fascinating to me that
[50:01.520 --> 50:09.040]  that's exactly what Apple's blast door was intended to, to sandbox. And then it's, you
[50:09.040 --> 50:15.520]  know, somehow incomplete. G Rambo extra, you know, hacker extraordinaire, DM me last week
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.040]  after my last talk show and said that it, he's not quite sure what the limits are. He
[50:21.040 --> 50:26.240]  doesn't have like a exact map. But he does know that some image processing and I message
[50:26.240 --> 50:31.840]  still doesn't go through blast door as of iOS 14.6 for some reason for reasons you know,
[50:31.840 --> 50:36.000]  that it wasn't Yeah, complete and maybe that's it. Maybe that they've just honed in
[50:36.640 --> 50:41.440]  on the pathways to delivering a message that don't go through blast story yet.
[50:41.440 --> 50:48.800]  Right. But he thought I think, I think I don't want to put words in his mouth. But basically,
[50:48.800 --> 50:55.120]  he thought that that one of the changes in iOS 15 before this news was that blast door
[50:55.120 --> 51:00.640]  had expanded the scope of what's in there. So I was 15 might mitigate a lot of this. I don't know.
[51:00.640 --> 51:09.440]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, the thing is, you know, if you were someone who is a high profile target
[51:09.440 --> 51:17.120]  for somebody, currently, they're going to get you. Right. Right. I mean, it doesn't matter what I
[51:17.120 --> 51:23.360]  mean, unless unless you are not going to use a smartphone. You're probably kind of screwed.
[51:24.320 --> 51:30.160]  Which is sad. Well, and then there's still, you know, it's there's still good old fashioned spy
[51:30.160 --> 51:36.720]  movie stuff, you know, and like with Bezos, right, when Bezos had his phone hacked, you know,
[51:36.720 --> 51:43.360]  the salacious pictures of him and the woman he was cheating on his wife with came out. It,
[51:43.360 --> 51:47.520]  there was all sorts of he hired experts, and there's all sorts of talk about, you know, maybe,
[51:47.520 --> 51:52.880]  you know, the Saudi Arabians had done it because he owns the Washington Post and the Washington
[51:52.880 --> 51:59.120]  Post was Yeah, the home of kashigi, the columnist, you know, who was an enemy of the state and they
[51:59.120 --> 52:09.280]  murdered. And it turns out it was his girlfriend's brother. Like took the pictures off her just Yeah.
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.320]  And that they just paid somebody just paid the guy paid him money and he'd rate
[52:16.320 --> 52:21.360]  right. And it's like, that's even worse, right? It's like as scary and spooky as you think it is
[52:21.360 --> 52:27.200]  that maybe Saudi Arabian spies are like, yeah, you know, setting up shop a quarter mile from
[52:27.200 --> 52:31.280]  your house with a little satellite dish and right hacking your phone remotely. It's like,
[52:31.280 --> 52:33.840]  even worse. That's your brother in law. It's your brother in law.
[52:35.120 --> 52:37.440]  It's always your brother locked. It's Gary.
[52:45.680 --> 52:49.440]  Do you think there was there was like a time where Gary I don't know what his name is. But
[52:49.440 --> 52:55.600]  Gary, Gary, Gary's nervous because he knows what he's done. And it's all over the news. And it's,
[52:55.600 --> 53:01.600]  you know, it's the front page all over the place. And it's the blockbuster gossip story of,
[53:01.600 --> 53:07.120]  you know, Billionaires Weekly. And then all of a sudden, his phone rings and the caller ID says,
[53:07.120 --> 53:14.640]  Jeff. Right? You're just like, don't answer red button, red button. Right?
[53:16.080 --> 53:19.120]  Yeah. And I wonder, I mean, I wonder, but also, though, if he was like,
[53:19.760 --> 53:23.760]  it felt like it was spiraling spiraling out of control when when there was speculation that it
[53:23.760 --> 53:27.520]  was Saudi Arabia, like, you know, like, I mean, if you thought that was funny, or if you thought,
[53:27.520 --> 53:35.760]  oh, I may be making making a problem here. All right, let me thank our next sponsor.

[56:09.920 --> 56:13.280]  the swim trunks right now because I was the other thing I noticed on vacation. I put my
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.240]  swim trunks on. I was like, I like these, but they're like, they're falling apart.
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.040]  They've got they've got a thing. I should buy more, really. I've got like at least two. I've
[56:23.040 --> 56:28.880]  got the Navy in the black. They have these polo shirts that are super lightweight, like the light
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.280]  and they're so good for really hot. Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I've got Yeah, I got one of those. I
[56:33.280 --> 56:37.120]  got one of those. I love those. Oh, my God. Because it's like there are times where it's like
[56:37.120 --> 56:41.840]  it you know, it's going to be really hot and humid East Coast summer. But it's like you're going
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.880]  somewhere where you kind of want to wear at least some kind of collar. It is right. Unprecedented.
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.360]  I have never seen a polo shirt like it where it looks good. And this is not I'm not making this
[56:51.360 --> 56:56.080]  up. I have worn these shirts multiple times. And my my son has said, hey, that's a nice shirt.
[56:57.040 --> 57:02.160]  And my son does not often say to me, hey, blank about you looks nice, you know?
[57:02.160 --> 57:11.280]  Yeah, yeah. I have noticed the thing about like upper end menswear and maybe any anybody's wear,
[57:11.280 --> 57:20.400]  but that have a very subtle logo. That seems like a trait of upper end menswear, upper end clothing
[57:20.400 --> 57:25.440]  these days. And they have a very subtle logo that is in a great spot, which is like just on the side
[57:25.440 --> 57:32.160]  near the seam. It's just a little MW and and I actually really like that. I usually don't like
[57:32.160 --> 57:38.800]  a logo on my clothes, but that one I actually think is really cool. Yeah, it's just sort of
[57:38.800 --> 57:46.480]  subtle. Yeah, yeah. Very nice. Have you been using the Safari public betas? I have a little bit on
[57:47.040 --> 57:54.480]  iPad OS. That's the only I have the public beta on my iPad. Yeah. And yeah, it's a whole thing,
[57:54.480 --> 58:01.760]  isn't it? It is I the iPad is where I've been. I only have one iPad. So I when I put it on right
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.520]  after but I don't really care that much about my iPad, which is why I was like ask her at beta one.
[58:06.160 --> 58:13.280]  I have the beta on a spare iPhone. And I have it on the I still have the the orange iMac
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.560]  m one review unit. So I was like, well, that's Apple's review, and I'll put the betas on it.
[58:18.560 --> 58:28.240]  It the betas for the iPad were really for Safari were really rough until last week when beta four
[58:28.240 --> 58:34.800]  came out like right. It really was and I get it. They're betas and they're they're obviously trying
[58:34.800 --> 58:44.480]  to react significantly and yet quickly to the to the critical response to Safari. And the fact that
[58:44.480 --> 58:49.920]  iPad OS didn't quite make the cut for beta three with the Okay, we'll give you a full tab bar.
[58:50.640 --> 58:55.120]  I get it. It's a beta. They're in rush. But it was sort of a kick kicking the balls because
[58:55.120 --> 59:00.320]  it's like, Oh, that's the one I really wanted. Some kind of help, please help.
[59:03.360 --> 59:07.040]  Yeah, it takes it takes time and they hadn't been able to react fast.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.480]  The more I use it, the less I like it. I have to say and on the iPad in particular,
[59:12.480 --> 59:16.080]  and I guess the Mac is the same. I just don't use the Mac version much. But on the iPad,
[59:16.080 --> 59:20.960]  the problem I keep having, even now that they have the tab bar back in beta four,
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.280]  I can't tell which tab is selected, like when I look at the tab bar. And in fact,
[59:25.280 --> 59:31.440]  sometimes it's scrolled off to the side, the active tab is off, because it's like the right
[59:31.440 --> 59:37.760]  most and you know, I've got like, I don't know, 30 tabs in the window. It's it that currently,
[59:37.760 --> 59:43.120]  it's like, it's not just my eyes or my inability to see the slight difference in darkness of the
[59:43.120 --> 59:49.200]  round wreck that indicates the selected tab. It's, it's not even in the tabs that are in the tab
[59:49.200 --> 59:55.760]  bar. I find that to be just Yeah, I don't know how it's choosing which ones it's showing.
[59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.320]  I don't either. And I don't understand how anybody who's ever used tab browsing,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.120]  even if you're the sort of person if you're, you're an Apple engineer working on the new
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:11.040]  Safari. And you personally don't typically have a lot of tabs in a window at a time. So
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.080]  it might be an oversight in your initial beta one implementation, that you're not really
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.760]  coding it up exactly the way you'd want it to be if there are 30 or 40 tabs in the front window.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.520]  Right? I get it. You know, it could happen. But it's like I you would at least think though,
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.760]  that you're always going to keep the current tab visible, maybe it would get too small,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.920]  because it needs to the design needs to be tweaked, you know, but right, and you'd scrunch
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:39.280]  them in the middle rather than but it's just having it be all the way off the side. It seems
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.320]  crazy to me that the selected tab isn't visible. Sometimes. Yeah. It's not. Do you have dark mode
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.840]  on on your No, I think if I were younger, I'd be all over dark mode. And I'm Yeah,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.400]  there's something about dark mode that no longer. It's like my brain is too old to,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:59.840]  to, yeah, to adapt. Well, so yeah, I mean, I do and I think maybe that makes it worse.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:05.840]  Because I'm looking at Mac rumors and you know, they're a little piece of their piece on this
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:11.840]  change in the latest beta. And, and of course, they have, you know, they have light mode on,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:18.320]  and they have three tabs open. Right. And so, so it looks like it's very straightforward.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.320]  But it's like, yeah, like you said, I mean, I have way more tabs open than that. And it
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:30.640]  And it is very confusing. It's I don't want to rehash arguments I've already made, you know,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.280]  there's only so much to be said. And, but I just feel like it's such a fundamental
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:46.400]  own goal, like, to, to, to make these things that they're calling tabs, that don't look like tabs
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.720]  at all. And I know that some of us have complained ever since iOS seven about buttons that don't look
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:59.760]  like buttons. And yeah, right. But it really is true. Like what is the difference between the URL
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:08.000]  field, the address field in Safari and the tab indicators? They're just they're both just round
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.680]  rects with a different background color and text in them. So yeah, they've literally made it so
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:19.200]  that tabs and a text field look identical, like they're not even close to identical. It's not
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:28.960]  like there are two types of buttons, you know, and the whole tabs as skeuomorphic tabs to some degree,
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:35.280]  you know, some correlation that whatever your app or operating system you're using,
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:40.160]  that you have tabs in your browser or tabs in some other app, you know, that works like this,
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.760]  you know, where you it's like putting two windows in the same window.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:51.840]  Or like in system preferences, when a sub panel of a preference panel has tabs, right? The tabs
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.560]  always look like actual physical paper tabs, like tabs on a file folder, because it's a metaphor
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.840]  that works. It's it. Right. You don't have to think about it. When tabs look like tabs,
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.880]  the metaphor is so clear that there's no cognitive load at all. It's it's this thing is connected.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.040]  There's there's a visual indication that says this selected tab is connected to this content.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:23.680]  And all these other tabs look like they're in the background. And when you click or tap on them,
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.120]  then they're connected to their content underneath them.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:35.680]  Firefox also uses round rex, which but they have they have them in a separate space from a very
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:42.160]  visibly different space from the, like the search field, the URL field. And so it actually works
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:48.080]  better. I still don't like it as much because like you said, I'd rather have I'd like the metaphor.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.160]  I think the metaphor makes sense. And why would you change? Why would you not use the metaphor
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.800]  if you could? So just to be just to be different is like the only reason that you can come up with
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.000]  I Yeah, it just seems like being different for being different, which really is antithetical
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.360]  to the typical Apple way, which is that they don't make things different just to be different. They
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.520]  only make things different when they are certain that it's better. And and that's I've had
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.040]  discussions with, you know, really high level people at Apple on and off the record. But they
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:29.760]  often reiterate that, you know, that, what, why, why do certain, like Mac books look the same for
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.360]  so many years, because they don't have a better idea yet for what would be better. So they're not
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.880]  going to just make change it minor cosmetic tweaks, just because this one's two years old,
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.920]  and we'll tweak something. No, until they have something that they feel is all together,
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.720]  this is way better. And then it's an all new design. But then they'll let that stand. And
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.680]  this tab thing really feels like cleverness in search of a problem that needed additional
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:03.920]  cleverness. Right. I could be wrong to this is one of those things where I, you know,
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:11.120]  as a professional columnist and podcast pundit, I'm supposed to have hot takes, right.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.360]  And I feel you know, every once in a while, I'll make people angry. Like,
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:28.320]  like all of my good friends who work at IBM. But that wasn't not the hottest hot take. But I feel
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:35.920]  like my take isn't hot enough on this. But I, who knows, I don't want to state with certainty how
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:43.680]  the mass public will react to this design come fall when these releases come out. Maybe nobody
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:49.680]  will notice maybe this is the sort of thing where 95% of people just are so just don't really think
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:54.720]  about user interfaces that yeah, adapt, and they'll just poke around. They're like, Oh,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.560]  this is new. And they'll poke around, right, figure out where the stuff they used to use
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:05.520]  is now. Maybe I can't help my gut feeling out is that people who are going to be
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.960]  angry about this, because they're going to feel lost and discombobulated in the new Safari.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:20.160]  Yeah, I mean, the fact that Firefox uses it, I, I would imagine that most people would probably be
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:29.200]  okay with it. But it it does it does lose a sense of sense.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.200]  Well, making sense. But the iPhone is obviously more used, because it's a more popular device.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.600]  And the iPhone to me is still it's more problematic. And I know that the latest
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.480]  beta put the share button back, but they all they really did was turn the dot dot dot button
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:50.880]  into a share button. And a lot of the stuff that they had stashed junk drawer style in the
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:59.200]  dot dot dot menu button is now just in the share. Right. It's, I just think fundamentally,
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:05.360]  the old Safari design that we've had ever since iOS 1.0 had two toolbars, there's a thing at the
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.160]  top, and then there's a thing at the bottom. And then as you scroll the page, they would
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:20.720]  fade away to take up less space until you needed them. And trying to cram what for 14 years had
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:29.680]  been two rows of touch controls on a phone into one row. It's too much. I feel like that's that
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.920]  you could get into all of the examples of this particular thing feels hidden, or the old a menu
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:42.960]  was was way more obvious for getting into reader mode, because the AI icon signifies font settings
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.400]  and readability. And there's all sorts of specific art, you know, how do you get to your bookmarks,
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.440]  it feels very complicated and discombobulating now, but all those specifics aside, it's that
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.240]  there used to be two rows, and they kind of needed two rows. And now they only they've decided to
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:05.680]  put everything in one row. And it's too much to put in one row. And you could you can make the
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.000]  argument that okay, we but we really want everything at the bottom, because we want
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.800]  everything to be one hand reachability with your thumb, which is an okay goal. I think it's
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.240]  overrated. I think it's something that sounds like it's very, would be a great idea. And I feel like
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:27.040]  in practice, the fact that some of safaris lesser used stuff was at the top is was fine, that's
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:32.640]  fine. You can't put everything at the bottom, but even so make it make the address bar right above
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:39.040]  the toolbar puts keep it as two rows, but put them both at the bottom. If more people would use the
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:45.280]  the 12 minute that we wouldn't have this problem. That's exactly right. Just throwing that out
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:53.680]  there. I've got I'm running the beta on the mini. That seems Yeah, I is such a delightful device.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.680]  What are you going to do? I know we talked about this. I Yeah, well, so yeah, so it seems like
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.600]  there's going to be a 13 minute and there's not going to be I mean, at least no plans to have a
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:09.040]  mini after that. Right. So I was planning on keeping this for two years and getting another
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:17.600]  one. Now I think I might get the 13 under the right idea that it will be the last phone that
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:23.360]  I get. I don't know. The last small phone I get and then go back to and then probably go back to
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:29.360]  the se assuming that they keep making the se which I think they it seems like they will do that. I
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:36.720]  mean, I it seems like I was perfectly fine when the se was the small phone that was also the cheap
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:46.320]  phone. I like it better as a small phone that I get more modern features with. But I would take
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:55.120]  that just because I'd much prefer the smaller size. So the rumors and I had the rumor game
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.800]  bores me the older I get more or less I'm interested. But the basic state of the rumors
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:06.640]  for iPhone are this year, two months from now, they'll they're coming out with a new lineup
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:15.200]  there. That'll either be I guess the 12 s or the 13. And as usual, it seems like the actual name
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:21.280]  of the product is is one of the best kept secrets, you know, and I still wonder if that's why they
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.360]  don't print the name of the product anywhere like on the box or anything. Yeah, that the boxes
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.760]  so they can they can change it at the last minute or just keep it secret. I don't know. But yeah,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:38.640]  but that it's just the same lineup as last year. So a mini, a regular, and then pro that's the
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:44.960]  same size as the regular and a pro max that's the same size as last year's pro max. But that next
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:11:00.000]  year, in 2022, the lineup is to 6.1 inch phones and to 6.7 inch phones, which would, I guess imply
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:08.080]  that they're going to add a big ass iPhone at a consumer level price, which has been, you know,
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.680]  like a product they don't make, right, the two products they don't make right now is they don't
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:21.760]  make a stainless steel three camera lens mini and they don't make a aluminum two camera lens
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:32.800]  consumer priced big ass giant fablet 6.7 inch phone. And there have been reports all all year
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:40.800]  long that the the 12 mini isn't selling in blockbuster numbers and right maybe disappointing
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.160]  to even Apple's projections that they've had to cut back, you know, dial back the production
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.120]  of the 12 mini to make other models that it's less popular than they anticipated.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:58.000]  I've long just pure spitball, just a spitball. Maybe it's totally off base. Maybe there's I just
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.520]  vastly because I tend to think it's a really cool product. Maybe I'm just obsessed with small
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:09.440]  products. But I've had the idea that then to really appreciate the mini, you need to see it
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.720]  in person. But 2020 was not a great year for going into retail stores to see new guy. Yeah,
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:20.080]  really person. Right. Right. That maybe well, but then I mean, I think that, well,
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:29.280]  I don't know the numbers. They know the numbers. But just from the outside, it's in my experience,
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.360]  because if you're a person who I and I don't know, like it's I don't know how many people are
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.640]  like this. I know there are people like this, because I've talked to a number of them.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:44.480]  But it's that Sanic data. So people who bought the original SE hung on to it for a long time
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.320]  and love that device. I mean, I had it for four years and it was. But like at the beginning of
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.840]  2020, it was really showing its age. It was very hard to work with. I had had the battery replaced
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.600]  and I still had to put it in a battery case because it wasn't holding enough charge to get
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.800]  through the day. And so when the SE two came out, I was like, Well, I got to get an SE two,
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.960]  because that's, you know, it's a reasonable size. It's bigger than I want it to be. But
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.320]  it's a nice phone. And it's available now. And it's really, it's relatively inexpensive.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:26.160]  So I got the SE two. And then, you know, sure enough, four months later, they shipped the
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:35.280]  phone that I actually wanted. Yeah, so I sold my SE two, I returned, you know, whatever,
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.600]  got a refund for my, whatever I got back for it, not full price, obviously, and got the new one.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.480]  But I got to believe not many people did that. Yeah. Everybody who had and held on to an SE
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:54.240]  got the SE, including people who were not necessarily put off by the price of the 12
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.160]  mini would not have been put up by the price of the 12 mini, they got it because
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.960]  they desperately needed a phone at that point.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:07.920]  I it makes me wonder and part of it too. And I get it like it, let's just say in some alternate
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:14.640]  universe, the 12 mini actually sold in surprisingly good numbers, right? That it was that that they
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:22.720]  were short, in short supply all throughout this year. And all by all signs, it was it's a smash
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:29.280]  hit that Apple underestimated. I you know, I'm not saying that next year's plans wouldn't then
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.080]  include that size iPhone, you know, they could change, you know, two years, one year is enough
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.040]  lead time. But a lot of this, though, Apple does plot out years in advance. And I can't help but
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.240]  think that there's a chance that they actually had this planned out all along that the mini size
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:50.240]  would only be for last year and this year. And not that it's going away, but that they'll just keep
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:57.360]  the iPhone 13 mini in the lineup. And then a year later, lower it in price, and it'll be like an SE
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:04.480]  or maybe they'll make a SE three that would be that size. You know that that that they'll just
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.720]  put a new chip. I think I think you're probably I think you're probably right. I think that they
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:15.040]  look at the people who want the small phone as a market that they don't care about as much
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:22.800]  and are going to toss things to whenever they feel like. Well, the other thing that the market that I
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:30.720]  think, even I who try to keep, I try to cognizantly be aware of the typical person, right. But I think
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:38.000]  that like, me and you and everybody who listens to shows like this, tend to overestimate the typical
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.800]  user and the other way more than people like us who really like having like you bought the mini
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.680]  and I know Marco has the mini and likes it and I was so close to buying it as my personal phone
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.680]  and still sort of feel like maybe I should have because it was the one year where I didn't need
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:01.520]  long battery life, blah, blah, blah. I love that it's there. But that market I think is small
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:08.320]  compared to the number of people who want an iPhone that works like their old iPhone and has
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.800]  a button that they put their thumb on and they click the button to go home. Yeah. And I think
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:21.120]  that's true. I think that market is huge. I know and I, you know, anecdotal, but that's my mom has
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:27.600]  the se two because she replaced like six s that just could not hold. That's what that's what my
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.440]  mom that's what my mom currently has. Yeah, she has a success. And I was like, you got to get in
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:37.360]  a seat and you know, and she was it the battery was so I don't even know what was going on because
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.880]  like the battery health I was you know, and it was all last year all remote when you know, during the
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.680]  stretch where I hadn't seen you know, didn't see my parents for God, I guess it was a year or
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:55.440]  whatever. So it was all tech support over the phone with mom. But like, the battery thing in
[01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:00.400]  settings wasn't saying it was terrible. I think she was like it was saying it was like 85% or
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:06.880]  something. And it wasn't terrible. But she was getting she'd like, she'd like leave the house
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:10.880]  and like three hours later, her phone was dead. I was like, well, that's not right. And it's like,
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.600]  we tried to reset and restore from iCloud. Nothing really is like, you know what, you shouldn't even
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:20.880]  get this fixed. Let's get your phones old. Let's get you the se two. But there was no question just
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.760]  looking at the website, she, she didn't want anything to do with the phones that didn't have
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:34.160]  a button down there. She just I think it's very hard to get a grasp on how many people are like
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.760]  that. And I see it like I look, I often read the comments on Mac rumors. You see it even like
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.960]  people who are enthusiastic enough to be like commenting on Mac rumors. There's a lot of people
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.960]  who really, really want to stick with a phone that has touch ID and a thumb button.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.560]  It'll be interesting to me because they've just were given a patent for
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.000]  touch ID on the screen, right. So it'll be interesting to see. I mean, I assume eventually
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.960]  they're going to try and put that in. Because it's been not to be just because of that patent,
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.520]  but because they've been talking about it for years. And I think they would probably keep both
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.960]  right. They would keep face ID and touch ID on the same device. But it'd be interesting to see once
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.320]  they put touch ID into the screen, if they keep having one with a button, because I still think
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.800]  that those people want the button, right? Like, like, like, I tried to tell my mom like, okay,
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.280]  you got to do now you do the same thing, except on the screen. I don't know how well that's gonna
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:37.520]  work. No, and I it's it's sort of new territory for Apple. Like Apple, you know, as at a
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:45.280]  philosophical level has always moved stuff ahead, and deprecated stuff, right? Like, you can't run
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.560]  32 bit apps anymore. You know, they they warn people wasn't like they pulled the rug on them
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.440]  and like, surprise, this phone, here's a new phone, and it doesn't run any of the 32 bit apps.
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.640]  You know, they come out at WWDC and say, we're moving to 64 bit, we're going to deprecate 32
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.640]  bit apps at some point. And you know, you can kind of read between the lines and think, well,
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.960]  this means next year. And Microsoft's philosophy is the opposite. They tried to, you know, you can
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:17.120]  run like old DOS programs from 1983. And they still run in the terminal in Windows and when 32
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:23.920]  apps still work. And, you know, you can defend both philosophies, but Apple's has always been
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:32.800]  to move stuff forward. And I kind of, you know, but then that philosophy runs into reality of
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.640]  human psychology when you have over a billion iPhones in use, right? I think that's what they
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:47.040]  said at the in the the the analyst call this week with Apple's results, was they were one of the
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:52.560]  questions was about active devices or something and and they clarified that it's over a billion,
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:57.760]  you know, like 1.4 billion devices in use, but like over a billion of them are iPhones.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:03.360]  Like that's crazy. Yeah, you know, that's like one out of every seven people on the planet
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:10.240]  is using an iPhone. And most of those people are not enthusiasts who really look forward to
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.160]  whether it's a better design or not. I think it's a better design. I love the new iPhone 10 era.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:23.280]  Okay, just swipe up from the bottom instead of having a button. I think it's a better design,
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:29.520]  but it is new and you tell people new and unfamiliar. Right. And again, that sort of
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.760]  mindset is where I I really have to think about like what the reaction to the new Safari on iOS
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:44.160]  15 is going to be, you know? Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know, we'll see. You're so you're thinking
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:50.160]  about buying the new mini. I think I think that's probably the smart money at this point. Like,
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:59.440]  you know, not that I ever do that. Why should I start now? You owe yourself some new iPhones,
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:04.320]  though, after having rocked the SC. That's what I said. That's what I told my wife. Right. So
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:09.280]  I said I had the same phone for four years. But now yeah, but now I'm gonna get like,
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:14.400]  I got two last year. And then I'm gonna get another one this year. That's true. Yeah.
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:18.800]  So now I'm now I'm overdoing it. Somebody has a problem. Yeah. I mean, if it's I only remember
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.800]  what plan I'm on. I think I'm on I think I'm on I'm I think I'm on a Verizon. I think I got a
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:29.200]  Verizon plan this time. So I if I could get the new phone, I probably will. I will, you know,
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.240]  without changing anything. I'll definitely do it. It's my payment. If my payment stays the same and
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:37.360]  just extends, I will definitely do it. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our next
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.120]  sponsors are good friends at Linode. That's I host during fireball at Linode. And I love them. I
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:49.840]  think they're just a terrific company. Go to linode comm slash the talk show and see why Linode has
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:55.920]  been voted the top infrastructure as a service provider by both G two and trust radius. They
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:02.320]  have award winning technical support that is offered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.560]  days a year. If you need tech support in the middle of the afternoon on Christmas Day, you can
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:12.880]  get it to any that that tech support is to every level of user you don't need some kind of big
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:18.320]  thousand dollar a month enterprise plan. You can get on their lowest level consumer plan and you
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:23.840]  get the same award winning tech support that everybody else does. ease of use set up everything
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.400]  like that is so clear why developers have been trusting Linode for big projects and small
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.800]  projects all the way since 2003. You can deploy deploy your entire application stack with their
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.760]  one click app marketplace. Or if it's more your style, build it all from scratch and manage
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:46.400]  everything yourself with supported, centralized tools like terraform. If that means something to
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:51.120]  you, you know what it means. Linode offers the best price to performance value for all compute
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.760]  instances, including GPUs, as well as block storage Kubernetes and their upcoming bare metal
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.000]  release. They make cloud computing fast, simple and affordable, allowing you to focus on your
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:08.160]  projects and your work, not your infrastructure. Once again, to find out more go to linode comm

[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:34.320]  and heard about Linode here. Let's shift gears. Any Oh, yeah, do you watch the do you watch the
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:41.840]  Loki? That's good. I was actually just thinking about that. Yeah, yeah, quite a bit. Because I
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:49.680]  covered it with with Dan and guy for Biff Biff your other podcast. Yeah, yeah. So I quite enjoyed
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.480]  it and was thrilled to see there's gonna be a second season. I it's I am too. I love it. I have
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:01.760]  a I have a review of it that I feel I keep hesitating to write it on Daring Fireball.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.200]  I'll tell it to you here. I'll let listeners of the show. I know it's going to make a certain
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:16.880]  crowd very angry. I think Loki is the best season of Doctor Who ever made. Right. No,
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.480]  I think it's I think that may be true. And it's fine. Then I liked and I like Dr. Who quite a bit.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.440]  I do too. Although I'm like a couple years behind like Jonas and I tend to fall seasons behind
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.280]  because I get confused about when BBC shows are available. And then we fall behind and then like
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:42.080]  binge them over Christmas or something like that. But it's that type of sci fi sort of time travel
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.480]  alternate thing. It's like if you like Doctor Who you're gonna love Loki and it's so smart and I'm
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.360]  I just adore the art direction. It is that's absolutely amazing stuff. Just like these are
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:06.080]  just gadgets that look old but new and I just love it. Yeah, I mean, I was just talking about
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.520]  this earlier this thing because I was thinking I was going to bring that up like the temp pad
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.720]  and and the design of that I was thinking because you were talking about the 30 pin connector I
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.720]  think made me think of that it's like I want to I want to go back and like get like maybe I think
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.920]  I still have an iPhone 4 like see if I could make it look like a temp pad. Just like build a case
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:34.400]  on around the outside. I wonder I so the temp pad for people who have I don't want to spoil it.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:41.040]  I really recommend it if you have Disney plus and even if you don't like a lot of the Marvel stuff,
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.720]  it Loki is sort of the opposite of like the Avenger movies, right, which are these big
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:53.680]  blockbuster three hour amusement park rides. I enjoyed all of them. But, you know, like the
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.320]  last two are sort of just big battle royale. Everybody's punching each other for three hours,
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:09.360]  crashing skyscrapers. Loki is Loki and it's about characters and sort of the opposite,
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:15.760]  you know, it's like the quiet notes, you know? Yeah, it's all quiet notes. And I enjoy that so
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.160]  much more. Personally, it's and it's and it's such a different take on I mean, like, well,
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:26.240]  an interesting take on the car. Yes. Yeah. And he starts out from the Avengers movie,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.440]  the first Avengers movie and goes on this, this real journey. I mean,
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.440]  and you can see why in addition to just, you know, Disney writing Tom Hiddleston a check,
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:42.000]  you know, like that has enough zeros at the end that he'd agree that you can see why an actor
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.800]  would say, Yeah, all right. Yeah, this concept. Sure. I'm in this is this actually seems like
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:57.040]  a lot of fun to play because it's not just me getting CGI thrown into walls, right? Nonstop.
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:03.840]  It is actual acting and it's good work. Yeah, there was there was a panel sort of zoom thing
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.520]  with all the actors from the three Marvel TV shows that they've done so far. And Anthony
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:17.680]  Mackie was given him a hard time because he apparently conducted a Loki seminar.
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.760]  And he was instructing, you know, like when they started the show, he sat down a bunch of people
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.080]  and talk to them for hours about the character, which was funny. And, you know,
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:35.520]  Mackie gives everybody a hard time. But I think it's also interesting. And I think a credit to
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.560]  Hiddleston that he cares enough about the character and is invested in it so much that
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.720]  he can talk about the character for hours on end and like and go into deep detail about so many
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:53.120]  different aspects. And, and he's, I think I've always thought he was terrific. I mean, from the
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.440]  from the Thor movie, which is not necessarily one of the best ones, but I think it's a very
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.880]  good movie. And because I enjoy all of them, really. He just that that moment when he sort of,
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.600]  you know, like his when Thor says this is madness, and he like sort of spits out, I'm like,
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.920]  is it is it like, like, he doesn't even know he's gone so far off the deep end that he's not even
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:19.920]  sure what he's doing anymore. He's just reacting. And I think he's a terrific actor and just really
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:26.000]  seems to revel in the character. Yeah. I called him Hiddleston. His name is Hiddleston. I don't
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.840]  know why I feel Hiddleston roll rolls off my tongue. But you called him you called him pixel
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:40.720]  mature. He was in a limited series. What was it called? It was this. The Night Manager.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:48.000]  Oh, I never saw Oh, you should absolutely try to do it. This is my recommendation of the week is to
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.880]  to watch the limited series. The Night Manager. It's based with Hugh with Hugh Laurie. Yeah,
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:29:02.000]  Hugh Laurie. It is based on a john lakar novel. And it's one of those things where it I always
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.960]  say this, like Hitchcock used to famously say that he never read novels, because he learned
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:13.200]  that you can't whatever makes a good novel good. It's too much to fit in a two hour movie. And
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.480]  but so he doesn't want to see he doesn't want to be tempted by great stories from a novel. So he
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.120]  likes to read he used to read short stories, because short stories turn into two hour movies
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:30.560]  much more naturally. And I love it's one of the great things about modern premiere TV that you
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:36.720]  can make. Like, if you have a six hour story to tell, you can make it six hours, you don't have
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:42.560]  to cut it to three, you know, and have Oh, my God, one three hour movie. And it's like, I got,
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.480]  you know, this isn't right. You can just tell a six hour story or you could tell a 10 hour story
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:52.960]  and the night manager is that sort of thing. And there were rumors that you know, that he was in
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.200]  the running to maybe be James Bond at some point. And you could see it. I think you could see it
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:04.160]  with Loki, which is weird, because Loki isn't James Bond like at all. But you know, there's
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.320]  but in that series, you could see it in him. But the night manager is sort of a spy movie. You can
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.800]  definitely see how he could do it. And he'd be very cool. I'll check. I'll check that out. Good
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:19.520]  cast. Yes. Olivia, Olivia Coleman. Oh, it's a terrific cast. It's really it's really unbelievable.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:25.120]  So anyway, the night night manager is my pick of the week. I swear to God, it's so good. It's
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:31.840]  really good. Yeah, so the temp pad, I don't want to spoil it. But the temp pad is like a little
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:39.840]  iPhone size sort of Palm pilot II thing and and the tech in the Loki in this Loki series world is
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:48.720]  all of this sort of retro. It's like a mishmash of like, stuff from the 50s 60s 70s 80s. You know
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:56.000]  that in the temp pad, it reminds me to do what's the game? It's like, it's called like a Pip Boy or
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.320]  something. One of the there's like some post apocalyptic video game where where the tech
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.960]  sort of looks like this, but it doesn't really matter. But it's all very cool. But it's like
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.800]  a one bit screen. It's like a like a like a black screen with just orange pick. Oh, and that's that's
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.840]  what Yeah, that's I think that's what I was thinking of when we were talking about the
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:22.800]  play date. Right, right. No, it all ties together. Yeah. Yeah, no. And yeah, and then there's Miss
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:32.640]  Meneses. Who is? Fallout is the name of the game. And there's this technology. Okay. I'm sure Hank,
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:37.440]  I didn't be the Hank. I'm sure hang split it. I Yeah, it's like a big risk computer that the
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:43.120]  that you that your character plays in Fallout. And it's sort of is like that where it's a one bit
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:48.320]  display. And looks old school, even though it takes place in the future. And the Pip Boy is
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:53.120]  how you interact with all of your it's like the HUD for the video game. It's all very clever.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:59.440]  I was saying to you, I don't think it would work. I mean, and again, it'd be, you know, a good way
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:06.720]  to flush millions of dollars down the toilet. But if somebody were to start, you know, some idea of
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:15.200]  like, what? What kind of cell phone could somebody make that? That would be interesting, but yet
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.640]  isn't even trying to completely against high end Samsung and iPhones. You can't beat Apple and
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:25.840]  Samsung on display technology. What if you made like a super retro looking phone that was like,
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:31.360]  acted like a modern smartphone and was all, you know, like a tempad? Like, would hipsters buy it?
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:39.760]  Maybe? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I don't know what the the breakeven point is. But like the playdate of
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:43.600]  cell phones, you know, something like that, you know, would have to be backlit. But what if it
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:48.960]  just was orange pixels on a black screen? And it just looked like that. And it was like your way
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.760]  of asserting I'm so hip that I don't even have a color. I don't have a color phone.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:59.920]  I don't have a TV. Like, I listen, I listen to vinyl, you'd have to, like,
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:06.080]  you'd have to have it. I put too much thought into this. But it's like, have you ever seen
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:11.120]  like, I think Hockenberry made one right icon factory made like a pixel camera that takes
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:16.800]  black and white? Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. Right. Right. Yeah. That look like they're dithered
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:21.920]  for the classic black and white Macintosh back in the day. So like, yeah, you could do it. You
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.200]  could take I mean, presumably, if if such some idiot actually made this idea, I'm talking about
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:35.120]  made a temp pad, modern smartphone, presumably, you would want the camera to capture a full,
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:42.560]  full color images, but on the one bit display to show it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I have I got a
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:50.720]  Kobo e reader a couple weeks ago. And one of the things I only just discovered yesterday was that
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:56.000]  it's got a bunch of beta features. And one of them is a web browser. So it's just interesting
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:03.920]  to browse the web in, you know, on an E device, which is, you know, a little bit similar to what
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:08.640]  you're talking about. Just it's not it's not pixeled very much, but it's it's all in black
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:15.120]  and white. I'm trying to remember that it was like the tail end of the Newton era coincided with the
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:21.280]  rise of the web. And there was a there was a web browser for the Newton. Oh, yeah. Trying to
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:27.760]  remember what it needs to escape. Yeah. No, that wasn't the name. Was it? Well, yeah, that was
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:32.880]  definitely one of them. Anyway, I don't know if maybe there were more maybe the icon factories
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:38.800]  app is called bit cam bit. Yeah, yeah. I'll put it in the show notes. I swear. It's the world's
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:43.360]  most advanced camera for your mini pocket computer. That's right. I can't I can't find it.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:50.960]  I'm sure I'm right. I you know, I'm an idiot. I'd buy it. I if somebody made like a $300 cell phone
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.640]  with a you know, and what if the choices were just whether you wanted green pixels on a black
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:01.200]  background or orange pixels on a back by that's so that made that should be the iPhone SE. Yeah.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:11.040]  I don't know. I think, again, I think that it would be a sensation in our crowd. Yes,
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:23.440]  for sure. And yeah, you know, it would be like 0.00000000001% of the population would buy one
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.640]  or have even heard of it, but I would dig it. And especially if like the industrial design looked
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:35.440]  like a 1983 Apple two or something, you know, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. You know,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.200]  I mean, you know, most of the like, I don't know about most of them, but many of the showrunners
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:46.080]  for Loki were big fans of Madman. I did not know that. Yeah, yeah. So that was one of the,
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:53.840]  you know, that was one of the reasons why they sort of have that aesthetic of like a 1960s office.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:36:01.120]  Yeah. The monologue analog devices that have incredible power. Well, and like the furniture.
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.000]  Yeah, that makes I mean, yeah, I guess it makes sense. You know, I mean, it's you don't have to
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.480]  even know that they've ever even heard of Madman to know that they're fans of 60s architecture and
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:17.680]  furniture and clothing and style and stuff like that. Yeah. All right. I have one more sponsor
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:23.040]  to thank. It's our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace. Squarespace is the
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:31.680]  all in one platform where you can host and publish and design a website that could contain anything
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.160]  you want. Maybe, you know, somebody who has a restaurant or opening a restaurant and they need
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:42.240]  a website, send them to Squarespace, almost every restaurant, every little indie restaurant in
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.840]  Philadelphia. If you look at the source code, it's a Squarespace site because Squarespace is great
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.800]  for when your business isn't actually running the website. Your business is like selling pizza
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.360]  or something like that. And you need a website and you need to be able to update it yourself
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.040]  with like hours and specials and stuff like that. Squarespace is where to send them. You don't want
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:11.040]  the hassle of being the smart web developer friend who's managing a website for people you know.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.560]  Send them to Squarespace. They could do it themselves and they'll be happier for it. It
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:20.000]  is so easy to set up a site on Squarespace and you get everything. Design tools that are WYSIWYG.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.840]  You just do it right in a browser. Templates, features to choose from. Do you want to have
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.440]  a blog? Add a blog. You don't want to need a blog? Take it out. It's all drag and drop,
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:36.720]  all easy to use. Even the analytics where you can see how many people are coming to your website,
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.720]  where they're coming from, it's built in. Just terrific. Where do you go to find out more and
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  send them from the show? Go to squarespace.com slash talk show, squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.960]  And when you use that and remember that code talk show, after the 30-day free trial,
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.200]  if you enter that code talk show, you get 10% off your first purchase. So my thanks to Squarespace
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:07.360]  for their continuing support of the show. Any other summer watching, any other movies or TV
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.600]  shows that caught your eye? Oh, there's this little show. I don't know if you've heard of it.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:24.160]  It's called Ted Lasso. They had their biggest viewing episode, I guess. Biggest viewing for the
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:29.600]  season two premiere for Ted Lasso, right? Well, it's such an interesting era now that we're sort
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:35.760]  of set. It struck me when I looked at the Emmy nominations. And I'm not a big awards guy. I tend
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.640]  to think the awards never really go to the best show. I don't really. The Emmys seem to be the
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:47.040]  one that I agree with the most though. It seems like Emmys tend to stand the test of time better
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:52.080]  than the Oscars. The Oscars often are like, you look back and you're like, that won? What?
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:04.080]  But the Emmys really struck me as to how clearly it's no longer a transition from traditional
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:12.000]  networks to streaming services for where the best shows are. It's already over. And the networks
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.600]  just show stuff like reality shows and game shows. I don't know. I guess old people still watch
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.760]  Tom Selleck on CBS. I don't know. Yeah, Ted Lasso. But it's cool. The other cool thing
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:32.160]  though about the streaming era is there's no penalty for being late to a show, right?
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.960]  So in the old days, if you didn't watch shows when they were on, you just missed it. And somebody
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.640]  would be like, do you ever watch Cheers? And you'd be like, no, what's that? And they're like,
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.800]  oh my God, it's hilarious. It's about this group of people in a bar in Boston. And it's just
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.160]  terrific. It's such a smart show. And you're like, oh. And then you're like, when's it come
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.240]  back on? They're like, September. And you're like, okay, I'll try to remember to watch it.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.560]  And you had no chance to catch up on season one because they didn't go into reruns until years
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.920]  later. And now- Well, it's still that way. It's still that way with my parents.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.480]  Well, my parents too, definitely.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.960]  Because while we were with them, we showed them an episode of Holy Moly. Have you ever seen Holy
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:15.920]  Moly? Holy Moly is a show that I got into during the pandemic. And the first season is, I think,
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:22.640]  on YouTube. At least it was when I started watching it. And then it's on ABC on Thursday
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:31.440]  nights. It's on ABC Tonight. And it's Extreme Mini Golf. Oh, you know what? I have seen commercials
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:36.160]  for that. I would love to watch that show. It's hilarious. I think it's hilarious. It's super
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:42.000]  dumb. It is exceedingly dumb. But it's got Rob Riggle, who is always a delight. And it's just,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.120]  I mean, they have holes. One of the holes is called Uranus. And obviously, they have as much
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.080]  fun with that as they possibly can. So we watched it. My parents are super into golf. And so we
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.840]  watched it with my parents. And they just thought it was absolutely hilarious. And my mom was like,
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:04.160]  how can I see Holy Moly? It's like, well, for you, you got to watch it. There's days at nine
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:12.560]  o'clock on ABC. Because it's on Hulu. But they don't get it. If I get it, I mean, they don't
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.320]  understand. We, Amy and I have gotten back into Press Your Luck, the new Press Your Luck, now
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:25.600]  hosted by Elizabeth Banks. Because I always, I loved the old Press Your Luck back when it was on
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:33.840]  with Peter Tamarkin. It was one of my favorite daytime game shows. I just loved it. So much fun.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:41.920]  I don't know. It's just pure, I don't know how you pronounce the word. Schadenfreude?
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:50.640]  It's just the delight in watching people experience bad luck and lose all their money.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.800]  It's a lot of fun. But they have the commercials for Holy Moly. If you're watching Press Your
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:08.480]  Luck, it's sort of like the old school ad recommendation engine. We don't need to track you
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.320]  or spy on you or anything. If you're watching Press Your Luck, you should be.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:22.640]  You're going to like this. I should mention, the hallmark hole on Holy Moly is Dutch courage. So,
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:27.280]  you know, you go to a mini golf, there's always a windmill hole. And you got to put through the
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:34.320]  windmill to get to the hole. So there's two windmills on this hole. And there's a walkway
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:40.720]  through them. And you have to dodge the blades as you go through. And the blades move pretty
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.280]  fast. And they're big. They're padded. But if they hit you, they knock you into the water.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:53.520]  See, I got it. And people, you know, most people do not make it through. And so it's mostly just
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.560]  the delight of seeing people get clobbered by giant windmill blades and thrown into the water.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:02.400]  As soon as we're done recording, I'm going right upstairs. And I'm
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:10.640]  setting the TiVo to record this. All right, I had to look it up. I know it's one of the ones that
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:18.880]  make me the most angry about the Academy Awards. 1981 Academy Awards. Oh, really? I don't have to
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:26.720]  be more specific because I can't. I was alive. But did not win for best picture, Raging Bull,
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:33.760]  which is perhaps one of the finest top five motion pictures ever made. You could easily find
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:41.840]  on a lot of top 10 lists. The best picture? Ordinary people. Oh, yeah. Which is, it's like
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:50.080]  going to the dentist. It is. I bet most people listening. I've seen it. I've seen it. I will
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:56.320]  never see it. I will never see it again either. There's great acting in it. It's not Raging Bull.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:01.680]  It's painful to watch. I bet most people listening to us right now have never heard of the movie
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.440]  Ordinary People. What we should have done is sandbagged them and tell them how great.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:13.120]  Well, that's true. Yeah. I mean, in retrospect, obviously, Raging Bull is definitely much more.
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.680]  Instead of telling them to watch The Night Manager, we should have told them
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.560]  to watch Ordinary People. This movie is riveting. It's gripping. It's a thrill ride. Edge of your
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:31.840]  seat. We did this to a friend in high school. We had a friend, my friend Todd, and I forget how it
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.800]  came up, but we were listening to the radio one day and a Steely Dan song came on. I don't know
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.080]  how me and my pal Ethan just kind of, without plotting it, we latched onto it and we're just
[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.720]  singing the praises of Steely Dan. And he's like, I never heard of them. And we're like, oh my God,
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:55.360]  you never heard of Steely Dan. Oh, they're the best. And then a couple of weeks later,
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:03.680]  we were in Todd's car. He had the ugliest Ford Mustang Ford ever made. When the Mustangs got
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:10.400]  Sedani. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I remember that. And it was only like eight years old, which sounds cool
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:14.160]  for a high school kid to have an eight-year-old Mustang, but it was just the worst. But anyway,
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:20.240]  he had an old Ford Mustang and we were in it and he had his tape box and he had four Steely Dan
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:28.240]  tapes. And it turns out he, on our recommendation, went out and bought four Steely Dan tapes.
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:35.440]  And he wasn't going to tell us. And he goes, you son of a bitches.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:47.840]  I spent 40 bucks on those tapes and it's awful. And I swear to God, I've never laughed so hard
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.600]  because I had forgotten that we'd even done it, that we had tried to sell them on it. Anyway,
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:59.280]  ordinary people go run it. I bet a lot of people will react the same way to Holy Moly,
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:06.320]  like, but I think it, because it is dumb. It is definitely dumb, but I find it delightful.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.880]  Well, I think that your description conveys that, where it's that the highlight is
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.960]  people inadvertently getting knocked into the water.
[01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:15.120]  Turn your brain, turn your brain all the way.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.240]  By a padded windmill.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.080]  Watch Holy Moly.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.520]  Have a good rest of your summer, John. It's been good talking to you. Good luck with the playdate.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:28.320]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I got to, got to limber up. I hope you've been hydrating.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:54.480]  Yeah. Fingers crossed. All right. Thank you, John.
