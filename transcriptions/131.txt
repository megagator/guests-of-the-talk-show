[00:00.000 --> 00:06.040]  oh man what a day yeah crazy we are recording on Wednesday the 16th show
[00:06.040 --> 00:12.800]  probably be out tomorrow well what's even happened so far today so far today
[00:12.800 --> 00:18.800]  watch OS 2.0 has been postponed indefinitely my guess is for a few days
[00:18.800 --> 00:24.960]  due to some sort of last-minute bug that has popped up in which Apple is not
[00:24.960 --> 00:28.640]  describing yeah it doesn't sound like a user facing bug though sounds more like
[00:28.640 --> 00:33.480]  a developer facing bug do you think so yeah and if you're on the GM or if
[00:33.480 --> 00:36.920]  you're on the beta you don't have any reason to be concerned about anything
[00:36.920 --> 00:40.720]  but if you remember last year I think they were problems with extension
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.600]  signing and then with the health kit apps and it took them a week or so to
[00:43.600 --> 00:46.280]  figure those I was I was wondering if maybe it was some kind of bug that
[00:46.280 --> 00:51.640]  affects the upgrade process maybe I mean the the beta upgrade worked fine yeah
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.560]  and it just it seemed more like a not front-facing issue than a
[00:55.560 --> 01:03.440]  front-facing issue yeah I don't know though it's hard to say but you know I
[01:03.440 --> 01:08.400]  think anybody wants to complain and you know it bugs happen I mean it's a hell
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.400]  of a lot better for Apple to find a bug before it ships and obviously it's a
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.280]  little embarrassing for them to have pronounced the date and then have to
[01:15.280 --> 01:22.560]  yank it but compare and contrast with the what was it nine nine point oh point
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.160]  one last year eight point oh point one oh eight point oh point one nine nine is
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.080]  this year no I am god damn it no it's might as well be a Monday remember the
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.880]  eight point oh point one last year came out and it didn't break everybody's
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.440]  phone but for some subset of users who were downloading it over the air it
[01:40.440 --> 01:44.960]  temporarily brick their kill touch ID and it killed LTE so if you were Jesse
[01:44.960 --> 01:49.760]  char you notice no problems whatsoever but if you're anyone else okay she
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.680]  doesn't get LTE I don't think she uses her phone as a phone I think it's just a
[01:53.680 --> 02:01.280]  phone call part oh I got you all right but her fingers do not register what
[02:01.280 --> 02:08.120]  else has happened today so iOS 9 is rolling out as we speak yes and one
[02:08.120 --> 02:10.520]  interesting thing you mentioned before the show started it does have a
[02:10.520 --> 02:16.160]  different build number than the GM that Apple distributed was that last week
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.320]  yeah the GM is 40 and the release version is 44 so obviously it's
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.720]  something and something minor at least in there changed so far so good on that
[02:25.720 --> 02:29.280]  from what I've seen yeah absolutely and if you do have the GM you'll get a
[02:29.280 --> 02:32.680]  software updates very small it's a few mega I think a hundred megabytes or
[02:32.680 --> 02:39.920]  something yeah content blockers are rolling out which I think is going to be
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.840]  a major it's inner it's just interesting to see how this is going to be because
[02:45.840 --> 02:53.080]  this is the sort of thing that is going to change a lot for people like me and
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.640]  you know maybe I don't know and it's also the only sort of app that you can
[02:56.640 --> 02:59.160]  really look for this I mean last year there was all sorts of a share
[02:59.160 --> 03:03.320]  extensions and action extensions and widgets and the only really big new kind
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.260]  of app you can get this year is content blocker so they're gonna get featured
[03:06.260 --> 03:11.280]  more than anything else right in terms of and it's funny too and and you know
[03:11.280 --> 03:15.040]  I'll get to it because you've written a massive massive review but it does it
[03:15.040 --> 03:22.320]  it's one of those things so that makes it hard to judge these OS releases by
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.840]  based on even if you just assume that the GM is good you know is real it's
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.560]  hard to judge the OS as a whole until after it ships and you have some time to
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.400]  use it with the real world stuff that that ships in other words nobody's gonna
[03:37.400 --> 03:44.400]  really form a serious opinion of iOS 9 until after the content blockers have
[03:44.400 --> 03:48.080]  come out and people have picked the ones they want if any and see how that
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.760]  affects their their usage and there was ways to beta test them beforehand but I
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.320]  am you know it's like you meant maybe you didn't get to beta test all of them
[03:55.320 --> 03:58.160]  yeah and you and I discussed this about the watch to like just testing
[03:58.160 --> 04:00.960]  complications and how much that would actually change your workflow it's gonna
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.060]  be very different yeah I thought the same thing and I don't have any beta
[04:05.060 --> 04:08.320]  apps I don't even know if that was possible with the watch so I have been
[04:08.320 --> 04:15.280]  playing with watch OS 2.0 for a few weeks now but I haven't written anything
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.080]  about it because I don't I don't see how I can judge it until after the
[04:19.080 --> 04:25.360]  complications come out and really frankly even just native apps in general
[04:25.360 --> 04:32.480]  on the watch and see if it solves some of the you know just so slow to launch
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.720]  problems that we've seen with the watch kit 1.0 watches yeah whether it's like
[04:36.720 --> 04:39.820]  slow apps or whether the watch isn't the same kind of app platform that maybe the
[04:39.820 --> 04:45.420]  phone or the tablet were yeah it's just impossible for me at least to make a
[04:45.420 --> 04:49.760]  judgment of it until I you know after this shakes out we live with it for a
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.240]  while me calling what I write reviews is kind of half a lie because most of them
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.760]  are just trying to explain how things work and how you can juggle the
[04:55.760 --> 05:00.560]  different options yeah I thought of that too because I linked to your review at
[05:00.560 --> 05:04.440]  I'm or your iOS 9 review and it's just what it's just says iOS 9 review and at
[05:04.440 --> 05:08.520]  this point you're nine versions into writing these things you might as well
[05:08.520 --> 05:15.920]  not change it now but review is it sells it short in some ways and it's
[05:15.920 --> 05:19.480]  misleading in others because it's not really review sort of is like is this
[05:19.480 --> 05:23.960]  good is this bad and there's obviously some of that but it's really more just
[05:23.960 --> 05:30.400]  like I don't know like everything you would want to know about iOS 9 yeah I'm
[05:30.400 --> 05:35.240]  fascinated about the technology yeah well but you do more than just the
[05:35.240 --> 05:40.800]  technology though you you you absolutely write about it from the perspective of
[05:40.800 --> 05:46.520]  the experience like it's one thing to just say here now you can do this and
[05:46.520 --> 05:54.280]  that but yours is more look I've been banging on this thing for months living
[05:54.280 --> 05:57.880]  with it and here's you know here's what it's like like here's here's not just a
[05:57.880 --> 06:01.560]  list of what's new in the notes app for example here's you know what this
[06:01.560 --> 06:04.960]  enables you to do with it you know it turns it into a totally different app
[06:04.960 --> 06:11.800]  now yeah absolutely just to name one example so when did you did you start
[06:11.800 --> 06:17.040]  using iOS 9 full-time well you made fun of me the day of the event because I
[06:17.040 --> 06:23.680]  showed you I put it on my phone already so that was that was WWDC yes and I put
[06:23.680 --> 06:27.200]  it on my carry and immediately you know I had no data signal and it took me a
[06:27.200 --> 06:30.720]  while to get that working well I think this year was actually a pretty good one
[06:30.720 --> 06:36.600]  for that I mean and if anybody it's funny if anybody would have reason to
[06:36.600 --> 06:40.640]  to install it right on day one and start living over there would be someone like
[06:40.640 --> 06:46.080]  you or Federico yeah somebody who's planning on writing one of these
[06:46.080 --> 06:52.320]  comprehensive and I mean it sincerely I mean book length reviews of it and you
[06:52.320 --> 06:56.280]  know the rough timeline and again you know this year we can you know talk
[06:56.280 --> 07:01.440]  about the fact that Apple's not having an October event but that the October
[07:01.440 --> 07:03.960]  event was always the one if there's only going to be one event that's the one
[07:03.960 --> 07:08.360]  that was going to be dropped because September is just sort of set in stone
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.120]  for the phones I mean and again you never know something unforeseen could
[07:12.120 --> 07:16.440]  happen that would delay it but you know we had it was a pretty good bet that
[07:16.440 --> 07:21.500]  iOS 9 was gonna ship sometime in the first two weeks of September yeah
[07:21.500 --> 07:24.980]  absolutely this event going all the way back to the iPod days is the holiday
[07:24.980 --> 07:27.280]  event for Apple where they set up everything that they expect everyone's
[07:27.280 --> 07:30.740]  gonna buy for the holidays yeah yeah even back to when they called it the
[07:30.740 --> 07:34.520]  music events yeah you know and it would just be you know before the iPhone it
[07:34.520 --> 07:40.220]  was this is when new iPods came out and you know sometimes it'd be like it would
[07:40.220 --> 07:43.840]  be weird sometimes there'd be like I work or something like that yeah and the
[07:43.840 --> 07:46.940]  occasionally like I think they had the first unibody Mac event in October but
[07:46.940 --> 07:49.580]  those were always they weren't regular for a while they would just be when they
[07:49.580 --> 07:52.940]  had something to talk about right so anyway somebody like you who wants to
[07:52.940 --> 07:57.640]  write and how many words was your review how many like 22,000 so there you go I
[07:57.640 --> 08:00.740]  mean that's you know again that's that might be short for a book but if you
[08:00.740 --> 08:05.520]  printed it out it's it's a lot more book length than it is article length yeah I
[08:05.520 --> 08:08.200]  did take stuff out like I took out stuff that I thought was only developer
[08:08.200 --> 08:11.160]  appropriate or was getting too far into the nitty-gritty so I did cut a lot as
[08:11.160 --> 08:17.480]  well I just wanted to keep it small book length I mean like a typical I mean it's
[08:17.480 --> 08:20.900]  hard to say what's typical these days the way stuff gets cut but something
[08:20.900 --> 08:24.680]  like a 4,000 word article if you're doing like a freelance writer that's
[08:24.680 --> 08:28.320]  like a feature article in a magazine for life and I think you know books
[08:28.320 --> 08:32.920]  obviously range in thickness greatly but I think once you're in the measuring in
[08:32.920 --> 08:36.920]  the tens of thousands it's book length or booklet length rather than article
[08:36.920 --> 08:41.060]  and I was eight is sorry I was nine is deceptive serenity did our Kohl's notes
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.440]  version like this is the important stuff you need to know and I think that hit
[08:43.440 --> 08:49.100]  four six thousand words just doing the rough take that's pretty it's pretty
[08:49.100 --> 08:55.820]  amazing I think in in broad terms I you know I think everybody you know keeps
[08:55.820 --> 08:59.660]  trying to set the stage that everybody who's writing about it is trying to set
[08:59.660 --> 09:03.200]  the stage it just that the basic expectation like for somebody who hasn't
[09:03.200 --> 09:06.960]  really been paying attention all summer which is actually you know not a bad way
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.240]  to go if you're a layperson sure take a look take a listen at WWDC think about
[09:11.240 --> 09:14.640]  what interests you tune out for the summer and wait to see what actually
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.040]  ships because sometimes stuff drops and stuff like that but everybody trying to
[09:19.040 --> 09:21.920]  give people the lay of the land the basic gist is okay this is not like a
[09:21.920 --> 09:26.480]  radical upgrade like iOS 7 this is a year-over-year thing which is fair
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.380]  enough and I don't disagree with that but I don't think we're ever gonna see
[09:31.380 --> 09:39.360]  an iOS 7 like a update again for iOS I think iOS 7 was where they reset to a
[09:39.360 --> 09:46.520]  foundation to build on for years I mean decades to come I think yeah I know I
[09:46.520 --> 09:49.520]  agree I mean if you look back in hindsight maybe some of it was
[09:49.520 --> 09:53.080]  serendipitous maybe some of it was planned but you couldn't get to iOS 9
[09:53.080 --> 09:57.000]  without iOS 7 and iOS 8 like you needed you needed the kind of an interface that
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.440]  could go through the size class changes that could go from being a regular to to
[10:02.440 --> 10:07.200]  one of the smaller size classes and you needed like so much of iOS 9 is built on
[10:07.200 --> 10:10.680]  extensibility and I remember we talked about last year about how how
[10:10.680 --> 10:14.120]  transformative extensibility could be that it was literally uncoupling
[10:14.120 --> 10:18.160]  features from apps it was it was setting them free from the binary and they're
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.040]  doing everything from content blockers to Safari view controller to the
[10:21.040 --> 10:24.600]  gameplay recording is all to a lot of the privacy stuff is all being done
[10:24.600 --> 10:27.920]  through extensibility and all the search stuff is being done through continuity
[10:27.920 --> 10:31.080]  because they're indexing our activity so they can take us back to it they can use
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.280]  it as a reminder it's all coming together really well in iOS 9 yeah I
[10:35.280 --> 10:43.680]  think so and but a lot of that really comes back to resetting just just
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.720]  resetting the table for iOS 7 and saying this let's get back to somewhere where
[10:48.720 --> 10:51.800]  we can build on and they knew where they needed to go and some of that is just
[10:51.800 --> 10:56.840]  purely engineering and it didn't require necessarily a visual refresh you know
[10:56.840 --> 11:00.320]  like size classes and extensibility obviously they could have done
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.720]  extensibility with the old look I mean it's nothing but I think it was worth it
[11:06.720 --> 11:09.160]  for them and I think this is the way they thought about it it was worth it to
[11:09.160 --> 11:15.600]  do all this resetting at once and then build from there yeah I agree I mean I
[11:15.600 --> 11:20.280]  just can't even imagine green felt or wood paneling changing from compact to
[11:20.280 --> 11:25.120]  regular size class on an iPad with split view yeah I mean and now look at Mac OS
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.120]  10 I think Mac OS 10 is a good comparison and it has had there have
[11:29.120 --> 11:32.840]  been a few times over the years where there's been a more significant visual
[11:32.840 --> 11:38.920]  refresh than others last year would be for example with Yosemite going to a
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.560]  more it's again not really iOS 7 look-alike but more like looks like it
[11:44.560 --> 11:51.720]  looks like a sibling to to iOS 7 and a few years before that there was the one
[11:51.720 --> 11:56.680]  where they got rid of all the metal and and and and having two different window
[11:56.680 --> 12:02.640]  types you know the aqua windows and the brushed metal windows but those weren't
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.480]  radical right I I don't I think Yosemite maybe was arguably but none of the
[12:08.480 --> 12:13.360]  previous ones really were radical in terms of having the sort of controversy
[12:13.360 --> 12:18.000]  that iOS 7 really you know almost the upheaval and the wow this looks
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.560]  altogether different sort of reaction and I think iOS 7 I think that this
[12:23.560 --> 12:26.760]  look I think it will evolve over time everything gets stale and fashions
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.520]  change and obviously even just the system font this year changed so it'll
[12:30.520 --> 12:34.560]  evolve and there might be some year coming where there's a more significant
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.760]  change then then in recent times but I really think that part of the plan with
[12:39.760 --> 12:48.480]  the iOS 7 look and going to a much more simpler and unadorned overall look was
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.680]  to get get to something that's a little bit less about trendiness and and a
[12:54.680 --> 13:00.800]  little bit more towards a design that's timeless specifically so that they don't
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.760]  have to do things like that again and that they can just keep iterating like
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.200]  they have this year I agree completely like I look at almost in architectural
[13:08.200 --> 13:11.600]  terms and it's just got great bones now and they can build out some differences
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.160]  like they can put in San Francisco and it refreshes everything or if they
[13:15.160 --> 13:18.080]  decide not to wait for quantum dot panels and they go with all that panels
[13:18.080 --> 13:21.080]  and they need a night theme because that's better on all that they can add
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.620]  all that in but the structure the physics the the playfulness of iOS that
[13:25.620 --> 13:29.360]  they've built now I think that's a really long-lasting platform yeah and I
[13:29.360 --> 13:32.900]  think it was definitely the intention and I think part of it is just the
[13:32.900 --> 13:38.560]  simple fact that even with their vast resources now that a lot of the teams at
[13:38.560 --> 13:43.340]  Apple are still relatively small Johnny Ives group is relatively small and it's
[13:43.340 --> 13:50.280]  always going to be relatively small and not having to worry about spending
[13:50.280 --> 13:56.840]  specific a lot of time every year updating the look of iOS and Mac OS 10
[13:56.840 --> 14:01.720]  and watch OS just to keep them looking fresh trying to stick to something
[14:01.720 --> 14:07.600]  that's a little bit more timeless even if it even if it decreases the sort of
[14:07.600 --> 14:11.760]  trendiness like wow that looks good again this year this is new you know
[14:11.760 --> 14:16.240]  like you do lose something marketing wise if there's not like wow that looks
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.600]  new every year but it saves them the time of having to just keep reinventing
[14:20.600 --> 14:23.960]  the stuff they're already they've already done and lets them spend times
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.400]  on expanding like last year they could expand and spend a lot of time on a
[14:28.400 --> 14:32.840]  watch this year they could spend a lot of time on Apple TV yeah no absolutely
[14:32.840 --> 14:36.960]  and the the interesting thing is that that was a painful moment that took a
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.960]  huge amount of willpower and a huge amount of effort and they turned that
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.160]  around in less than even a year and then they did another massive change with
[14:44.160 --> 14:49.200]  iOS 8 and built out all the the new frameworks but now that's done and they
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.940]  can do things that are super interesting and I think you need those moments you
[14:53.940 --> 14:56.440]  need those moments so this is what we thought the platform was going to be and
[14:56.440 --> 15:00.180]  six years seven years later this is what we understand that is now and if we want
[15:00.180 --> 15:03.560]  to go ten years forward we need to build that out now because it's only going to
[15:03.560 --> 15:07.600]  get harder as we move on and they can do a gold phone or a rose gold phone and
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.000]  that will appeal to people who just want a new color but the software inside it
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.060]  you know yes you know maybe the what maybe the wallpaper will match the rose
[15:15.060 --> 15:18.780]  gold or the gold or the new sport bands whatever but the software itself will
[15:18.780 --> 15:23.280]  scale through all of that yeah I mean I know that this is in a lot of ways a
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.000]  problematic analogy but if you just compare it to a paint of coat on a
[15:27.000 --> 15:33.280]  building I think for the first few years of iOS Apple was sort of not necessarily
[15:33.280 --> 15:35.880]  picking it wasn't like radically changing every year but they were going
[15:35.880 --> 15:40.880]  back and having to repaint a lot of the building every year and I think with the
[15:40.880 --> 15:46.040]  iOS 7 look is is like a longer lasting coat of paint and then they can just go
[15:46.040 --> 15:50.440]  back and update some of the trim you know and so okay now it's not Helvetica
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.200]  Neue it's San Francisco is the system font but the whole thing didn't have to
[15:55.200 --> 15:59.880]  get repainted it feels almost like they switched from doing iOS as a bitmap and
[15:59.880 --> 16:05.480]  made it a vector yeah yeah sort of I think that's a very good way of putting
[16:05.480 --> 16:09.100]  it and I think that fitting it in with the size classes is part of that too I
[16:09.100 --> 16:14.840]  think that that pixel-perfect stuff I was you know and I I really do hope over
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.400]  the year I I'm a fan of this design I think it's the right thing I know
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.960]  there's still people who still complain about it but I doesn't mean that I've
[16:22.960 --> 16:28.040]  suddenly dropped it and think that the old iOS look was bad I mean I there's
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.180]  certain aspects of it that I miss but it just I don't think it gave them the
[16:34.180 --> 16:38.760]  flexibility that they need and we can subjectively like or dislike individual
[16:38.760 --> 16:42.600]  elements of the latest iOS or iOS 6 or 5 but objectively there were huge gains
[16:42.600 --> 16:48.560]  that were made by going this direction yeah let's take a brief break and then
[16:48.560 --> 16:53.360]  when we come back let's talk about the event last week maybe not spend too much
[16:53.360 --> 16:57.720]  time on it but then we'll go on to iOS 9 but let me take a break and thank our
[16:57.720 --> 17:02.840]  first sponsor this week and it is our good friends at hover you guys know
[17:02.840 --> 17:08.960]  however they're the best place to buy and manage domain names when you have a
[17:08.960 --> 17:12.800]  great idea you want to secure a great domain for it you want something catchy
[17:12.800 --> 17:18.680]  and memorable to represent your project you want a domain name that looks good
[17:18.680 --> 17:21.560]  like a lot of times you think you have it you know the word you want and you
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.400]  find another top you know the top level domain to put it to put next to it but
[17:25.400 --> 17:28.720]  then when you look at it sometimes certain letters don't look right next to
[17:28.720 --> 17:32.240]  each other or if you make it all lowercase certain words combined
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.320]  together and just don't look right together because it looks like it might
[17:36.320 --> 17:39.000]  spell a different word or something like that it's hard to get a good domain you
[17:39.000 --> 17:44.120]  have to play around with it hover makes that easy they've got great tools to
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.800]  find new domains when you find one that you want and it's taken maybe if it's
[17:50.800 --> 17:54.960]  the dot-com it's a very good chance it's taken they help you find another top
[17:54.960 --> 18:00.680]  level domain with the same root word all of that in less than five minutes even
[18:00.680 --> 18:04.640]  if you haven't ever even opened your hover account yet with five minutes you
[18:04.640 --> 18:09.040]  can find the domain register it get it up and running and all you have to do is
[18:09.040 --> 18:13.320]  search for a few keywords to get it going and they'll show you all of the
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.320]  results against all the extensions out there if you've ever registered a domain
[18:18.320 --> 18:21.480]  anywhere else you know that a lot of the companies in the domain registration
[18:21.480 --> 18:25.840]  business make it purposefully unpleasant it's a it's a real scammy business
[18:25.840 --> 18:30.120]  there's there's it's it's a race to the bottom pricing wise for the most part
[18:30.120 --> 18:37.040]  and therefore to make up for it they do a lot of just like upsell stuff to to
[18:37.040 --> 18:43.120]  to get the extra money out of you hover goes the other way they do have great
[18:43.120 --> 18:46.160]  prices they're not the lowest but they shouldn't be the lowest because they
[18:46.160 --> 18:49.640]  what they do they're they're competitive and I think it's well worth the value
[18:49.640 --> 18:53.760]  but what they do is they just include all the stuff that you don't have to
[18:53.760 --> 18:59.680]  upgrade for a great example is who is privacy so that when people look up your
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.400]  domain name can they see your home address and phone number well everybody
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.880]  knows you don't want that up there and who is stuff but other other registers
[19:08.880 --> 19:11.560]  make you pay for it well that's ridiculous obviously that should be
[19:11.560 --> 19:17.000]  included in your account hover makes that so and last but not least in fact
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.440]  last but most important hover has the most amazing thing in the entire
[19:20.440 --> 19:23.960]  business they call it free valet transfer service so if you've already
[19:23.960 --> 19:28.360]  got domain names at another registrar and you want to move them to hover which
[19:28.360 --> 19:32.400]  you should what you can do instead of doing all that busy work yourself is
[19:32.400 --> 19:39.280]  just sign up for a hover account go to the valley transfer give them your the
[19:39.280 --> 19:43.560]  information did log into your registrar at the other places and their experts
[19:43.560 --> 19:48.400]  at hover will will handle everything to move them over you don't have to pay for
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.060]  it that's just included with your hover account that's just that's that's how
[19:52.060 --> 19:55.080]  sure they are that once you switch those domains to hover that you're never going
[19:55.080 --> 19:58.280]  to switch them away you'll just be a longtime customer and they just know
[19:58.280 --> 20:01.840]  they'll make the money from you on the renewals as the years go by there that
[20:01.840 --> 20:06.720]  can that confident in it I have a lot of friends with a lot of domains and a lot
[20:06.720 --> 20:10.200]  of them use hover and I've never heard of one person who's ever switched from
[20:10.200 --> 20:15.760]  hover to another domain it's that good so here's the deal go to hover calm they
[20:15.760 --> 20:20.880]  have a code you'll get 10% off your first purchase by using this code it's
[20:20.880 --> 20:24.440]  just for this episode of this show and they always pick these clever codes here
[20:24.440 --> 20:32.320]  it is crappy old phone and you'll save 10% off your first purchase at checkout
[20:32.320 --> 20:38.720]  so my thanks to them hover calm and use the code crappy old phone and anybody
[20:38.720 --> 20:42.840]  listening to this show this week you've got it you've got a crappy old phone in
[20:42.840 --> 20:53.360]  your hand all right so last week's event you were there yes we we sat near each
[20:53.360 --> 21:01.040]  other I was wrong in advance I thought you know I think they'll do the same
[21:01.040 --> 21:03.680]  thing they usually do have the two events one after another because it
[21:03.680 --> 21:08.320]  would be busy and because you know they're otherwise they're not gonna be
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.720]  able to talk about the Mac at all so I was wrong they only have they're only
[21:13.720 --> 21:17.920]  having one event this year I'm almost certain and talking to friends behind
[21:17.920 --> 21:21.960]  the scenes that certainly is the plan if there is another public event this year
[21:21.960 --> 21:28.400]  it would be something that the dressing some kind of surprise but I was right it
[21:28.400 --> 21:34.400]  made for a very busy event and it left no time at all for the Mac yeah no time
[21:34.400 --> 21:40.120]  for the Mac OS 10 was well it was a Easter egg in Craig's email box I caught
[21:40.120 --> 21:43.880]  that it's funny because I take notes and there it's funny when I rewatch the
[21:43.880 --> 21:48.220]  event I never once catch everything they're too dense especially when they
[21:48.220 --> 21:52.300]  go fast like this so I always there's always some things I caught I did happen
[21:52.300 --> 21:58.240]  to catch that so what was it Craig was up there yeah he was just demoing the
[21:58.240 --> 22:03.580]  email preview abilities the hint peak and pop for 3d touch and he did the
[22:03.580 --> 22:08.440]  preview on Phil Schiller's email and it had secret release date for OS 10 l copy
[22:08.440 --> 22:11.880]  town September 30th don't let anybody find out yeah and then I think it's at
[22:11.880 --> 22:17.920]  the bottom note Apple confidential yeah that was about it for the Mac though
[22:17.920 --> 22:26.200]  in hindsight I guess it makes sense and especially if they don't have new Mac
[22:26.200 --> 22:29.880]  hardware ready to go later this year although I think if they do and it's
[22:29.880 --> 22:34.960]  just retina 21 chime back and minor refreshes to to MacBook Pros or
[22:34.960 --> 22:39.080]  something they can just do those with a press release yeah the MacBook shipped
[22:39.080 --> 22:43.440]  in March what was announced in March and Intel took so long to get Broadwell out
[22:43.440 --> 22:47.200]  and now they're just beginning to roll out Skylake that it's hard it's hard to
[22:47.200 --> 22:49.720]  see that they have the chips to make the sort of MacBooks that they would want to
[22:49.720 --> 22:54.340]  show off on a stage yeah and you know otherwise there's not much left for an
[22:54.340 --> 23:00.680]  event I forget what other a few other readers have you know sent in as I
[23:00.680 --> 23:05.000]  speculation yeah more or less routers yeah who knows I forget what somebody
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.280]  else it's just not possible there's no way that they can make an event that's
[23:09.280 --> 23:15.300]  worth it would it have been worth it to have a separate event now if they had
[23:15.300 --> 23:19.520]  held the iPads including the iPad Pro I think they could have done it because
[23:19.520 --> 23:22.840]  the and then what they could have done I guess although in high you know maybe
[23:22.840 --> 23:27.720]  not see I was thinking because the there's a new iPad mini for yeah which
[23:27.720 --> 23:33.800]  is now technically equivalent to the iPad air to a processor difference but
[23:33.800 --> 23:39.120]  that's about it that's interesting and that's a new machine actually does kind
[23:39.120 --> 23:43.340]  of make for a hard demo though if once you've shown off all the features in the
[23:43.340 --> 23:48.400]  new OS on the iPad Pro so maybe it doesn't make for a good event maybe part
[23:48.400 --> 23:52.280]  of it you know part of it obviously I think talking to people behind the
[23:52.280 --> 23:56.440]  scenes was that Apple really wanted to only have one event because doing one
[23:56.440 --> 24:01.400]  event and putting all of the wood behind that arrow is easier than doing two
[24:01.400 --> 24:04.700]  events even if one of them is sort of a smaller one right there on Apple's
[24:04.700 --> 24:08.780]  campus but second maybe that wouldn't have been enough to make you know maybe
[24:08.780 --> 24:12.280]  that would have left people you know people who go and travel to get their
[24:12.280 --> 24:16.280]  thinking this wasn't worth it and the people who watch from home there they're
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.640]  watching and they see 4k IMAX not as impressive as a 5k iMac the iPad mini
[24:20.640 --> 24:24.120]  3 it's not as impressive as the iPad sorry iPad mini 4 not as impressive as
[24:24.120 --> 24:27.720]  the iPad air 2 and then you have the iPad Pro which is great but Apple is
[24:27.720 --> 24:31.800]  usually really good when they have a to get like a double-barrel event yeah yeah
[24:31.800 --> 24:37.600]  and I think it's just like last year's retina iMac except smaller and it's just
[24:37.600 --> 24:42.760]  like last year's iPad air 2 but smaller it isn't really that's great if what you
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.560]  want is smaller but it's it doesn't really make for a demo I will miss Craig
[24:47.560 --> 24:52.400]  getting up on stage and saying OS 10 is available today but other than that yeah
[24:52.400 --> 24:56.560]  yeah the only thing really they would have left to demo is to rehash and I
[24:56.560 --> 25:00.080]  think that would be good but it just I may not make for a great event is to
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.480]  just go through here's the top 10 best features the 10 pole features in
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.920]  Yosemite do that for iOS this year I mean iOS didn't get any time yeah they
[25:09.920 --> 25:14.120]  kind of scan again because they went long enough as is they kind of skip that
[25:14.120 --> 25:18.640]  rehash of you know what they call the tent poles and usually it's 10 of them
[25:18.640 --> 25:23.160]  you know but here's the top 10 things that we want you to know about and
[25:23.160 --> 25:26.960]  people forget I know people sometimes complain about it because they're like
[25:26.960 --> 25:33.200]  they showed all this at WWDC I think you know people who are really really cued
[25:33.200 --> 25:36.680]  into this I mean sometimes I get that feeling too when I'm watching it but I
[25:36.680 --> 25:39.400]  totally understand why Apple does it because that's how you that's how you
[25:39.400 --> 25:44.760]  teach people things you have to repeat it it's it's both a pedagogical axiom
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.120]  and a marketing axiom you have to make your point multiple times to get it
[25:49.120 --> 25:55.560]  through to more people you know then you will see it's not like Apple talks to us
[25:55.560 --> 25:59.880]  very often us being the greater community they just don't have a lot of
[25:59.880 --> 26:02.440]  air time so when they have that air time they want to do that exactly here's what
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.680]  we're gonna tell you we're telling it to you did you see what we told you the
[26:08.680 --> 26:14.720]  event itself it was if I had known if I had somehow gotten advanced access
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.400]  inside the facility and seen what they had built I would have been a lot less
[26:20.400 --> 26:25.200]  likely to guess that they were gonna do two events this year yeah like it's hard
[26:25.200 --> 26:29.560]  for me to you know in my write-up afterwards I don't think I'd I had so
[26:29.560 --> 26:34.040]  much to cover but it's it's really hard for me to express just how impressive
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.000]  the build-out inside that the the Bill Graham Civic Center was yeah if you'd
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.960]  never seen the Civic Center without it you were like I had never seen it before
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.520]  I didn't know what it looked like so I went and looked at some other pictures
[26:45.520 --> 26:48.640]  afterwards it and if you'd only ever seen it without what Apple did to it you
[26:48.640 --> 26:51.480]  may not appreciate it but they transformed that structure it's almost
[26:51.480 --> 26:54.460]  like a movie set when you come into an empty warehouse and all of a sudden it's
[26:54.460 --> 26:59.000]  it's the force awakens inside it yeah it's that's a good way to put it that
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.440]  it's it was like a movie set they built a movie set for an Apple keynote room
[27:03.440 --> 27:06.740]  like I was saying that they built a building within the building and then
[27:06.740 --> 27:10.400]  maybe that's not right because it was all it didn't have an outside structure
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.960]  for you to see it was all inside so a movie set is maybe a better way to put
[27:14.960 --> 27:21.000]  it because it was all meant to be seen from the inside like a movie set and the
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.520]  outside who knows what it looked like you know it was impossible to sort of
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.160]  see that that and from one direction I mean it's kept saying 7,000 seats but
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.400]  they had maybe 1,500 1,700 available in there yeah yeah I think that was it
[27:33.400 --> 27:38.200]  because it's you know that they took up a bunch of that what would be the floor
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.780]  space for like if you wanted to hold a concert or something with max you know
[27:42.780 --> 27:46.560]  and sell the most tickets you would just set it up an entirely different way I
[27:46.560 --> 27:51.680]  mean it really was more like a movie set 360 degrees all the way around even the
[27:51.680 --> 27:58.240]  flooring you know the the stadium seating that we sat on was all built by
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.080]  Apple and and temporary yeah it's not like they have a big warehouse in
[28:03.080 --> 28:05.720]  Cupertino that they cart the stuff in and then put it away again for next
[28:05.720 --> 28:09.720]  year's event they built this stuff they build it like bespoke every time yeah
[28:09.720 --> 28:14.440]  they even put in an air system so there that the building is not
[28:14.440 --> 28:17.880]  air-conditioned and I was talking to somebody at Apple and when they were
[28:17.880 --> 28:20.920]  talking you know in preliminary talks to maybe use this building they were like
[28:20.920 --> 28:26.320]  well what's the air conditioning situation and the Bill Graham people
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.080]  were like oh it's easy it's great you just open the windows yeah no their
[28:30.080 --> 28:33.480]  events team is spectacular they they really could run production for any
[28:33.480 --> 28:38.160]  major studio it's yeah I was thinking about this what do you think that cost
[28:38.160 --> 28:42.200]  them oh man I mean just the air conditioning a lot and we were actually
[28:42.200 --> 28:44.760]  joking at the event that we'd rather the Wi-Fi went out than the
[28:44.760 --> 28:47.920]  air-conditioning because it was so hot yeah but it must have been in the
[28:47.920 --> 28:54.600]  millions I believe how high I am millions I'm not in that field so I
[28:54.600 --> 28:59.600]  could be way off I I'm guessing 10 to 15 million dollars doesn't sound crazy to
[28:59.600 --> 29:03.520]  me well and think about it like what's a Super Bowl ad cost yeah like five
[29:03.520 --> 29:08.800]  million dollars and plus the production costs to make the commercial so you know
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.680]  it's not unheard of for a company to spend 10 to 20 million dollars on a TV
[29:12.680 --> 29:18.120]  campaign or commercial and Apple certainly gets super you know I well
[29:18.120 --> 29:24.400]  they get more than Super Bowl commercial exposure out of these special events and
[29:24.400 --> 29:27.080]  unlike a commercial has to be done live they have to get it right the first time
[29:27.080 --> 29:30.680]  right but they don't have to share the day with anybody else so instead of
[29:30.680 --> 29:35.760]  racing to you know have being one of 40 different all trying to be the you know
[29:35.760 --> 29:39.120]  the commercial everybody's talking about tomorrow Apple knows everybody's gonna
[29:39.120 --> 29:42.800]  be talking about them tomorrow but I think spending 10 20 million dollars on
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.280]  it is is not outlandish and I think it looked like something they might have
[29:46.280 --> 29:49.480]  spent 10 20 million dollars on you know what however long they'd rented the
[29:49.480 --> 29:56.160]  place out however many people it took to build it however much it costs to to put
[29:56.160 --> 30:00.400]  all that stuff up I mean the seats I again I wrote this that I think that
[30:00.400 --> 30:03.040]  they just I don't know if they threw them out I don't know if there was
[30:03.040 --> 30:06.600]  someone they could donate them to but the seating was that we sat in was all
[30:06.600 --> 30:10.840]  brand-new I mean and I don't know that there's a way to rent that like it
[30:10.840 --> 30:16.800]  wasn't they weren't chairs that you can like pick up and and move they were like
[30:16.800 --> 30:19.920]  rows of seating that were connected to each other you know there's certain
[30:19.920 --> 30:24.440]  types of folding chairs that that you can latch next to each other for ad-hoc
[30:24.440 --> 30:27.040]  events that you can take them down and stuff like that I didn't look like condo
[30:27.040 --> 30:30.660]  association seating at use that last week right and they all look the ones I
[30:30.660 --> 30:35.420]  was in look you know around our section that they all look brand new yeah but on
[30:35.420 --> 30:38.240]  the other hand and some people you know when I wrote that they were like well
[30:38.240 --> 30:42.400]  maybe they're gonna use those on the campus in their theater and that's a
[30:42.400 --> 30:47.600]  good idea but they weren't that sturdy they were they you know there was a lot
[30:47.600 --> 30:53.320]  of rock to them I mean they were nice and they were cushioned but they I'd be
[30:53.320 --> 30:57.160]  shocked if those exact seats were the ones Apple has in their new theater on
[30:57.160 --> 31:00.160]  campus because they weren't that nice they didn't look Johnny I've team
[31:00.160 --> 31:04.640]  designed no they definitely did not and they also did not feel built to last
[31:04.640 --> 31:11.000]  yeah they you know but they were you know it just was just an unbelievable
[31:11.000 --> 31:13.960]  and the crazy thing is it wasn't just that like if you ever go to CES and
[31:13.960 --> 31:17.240]  talk to him about how much those booths cost they built the equivalent like they
[31:17.240 --> 31:20.880]  had pods for the Apple TV demos little living rooms and I don't know how many
[31:20.880 --> 31:25.680]  it looked like 10 or 20 and those are all like that's a CES style pavilion as
[31:25.680 --> 31:31.000]  well as the event they're already running yeah absolutely the screen was
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.280]  enormous the stage and screen were enormous and that's the sort of thing
[31:34.280 --> 31:38.200]  that's really I think it's impossible to gauge if you're not there like the you
[31:38.200 --> 31:41.240]  know and again does it really matter that we were there message wise no but
[31:41.240 --> 31:46.040]  in terms of understanding the scale of the the show it does because when you're
[31:46.040 --> 31:50.480]  on TV you know watching the video it it reduces that scale you're really just
[31:50.480 --> 31:55.180]  watching the slides go by and you don't really see the size of it it was
[31:55.180 --> 31:59.080]  enormous it was so big that I noticed several times that when they were
[31:59.080 --> 32:03.840]  switching to videos and they're like you know I like when one of the Johnny Iams
[32:03.840 --> 32:10.440]  narrated videos that that that whoever was speaking Phil or Tim or whoever would
[32:10.440 --> 32:13.520]  say you know now we have you know I tell you about it they'd start playing it
[32:13.520 --> 32:17.560]  while they were still standing in front of it because it was so big that it
[32:17.560 --> 32:21.140]  would create an awkward pause if they waited until they walked until they
[32:21.140 --> 32:25.520]  weren't in front of it anymore it was it was almost like an IMAX version of a of
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.760]  a tech demo yeah like ordinarily you would never never and I and I think it
[32:29.760 --> 32:33.640]  had to come through rehearsals I think even like your instincts even as you
[32:33.640 --> 32:38.400]  know not that polished of a public speaker you'd you would it would occur
[32:38.400 --> 32:42.520]  to you I'm gonna hit the button to play this after I'm off to the side but it
[32:42.520 --> 32:45.240]  was so big that they had to do it while they were sort of standing in front of
[32:45.240 --> 32:48.560]  it and because it was so big it did they never at least I didn't even notice
[32:48.560 --> 32:54.360]  anybody once the video played they were so small in comparison yeah yeah oh
[32:54.360 --> 32:58.520]  definitely definitely and I even thought that too while I was watching it that it
[32:58.520 --> 33:00.880]  didn't make that big a difference because you really just sort of saw it
[33:00.880 --> 33:05.160]  you know a little tiny bit of their silhouette instead of the screen it was
[33:05.160 --> 33:11.760]  a truly enormous screen good sound really good sound and again that's a big
[33:11.760 --> 33:14.520]  build-out because they weren't it wasn't like there was a sound system in there
[33:14.520 --> 33:19.360]  that they use they put one in they put like a couple of those new iPad pro
[33:19.360 --> 33:25.760]  speakers just in each corner turn them to max and then the other thing in
[33:25.760 --> 33:30.400]  addition to those those cubicles they built it was like it was like a off to
[33:30.400 --> 33:35.520]  stage left was where they had all of these little living rooms to test Apple
[33:35.520 --> 33:43.860]  TV and iPad Pro demos that were hosted by like talented artists yes that you
[33:43.860 --> 33:47.360]  know who already had exposure to the thing and could show you what somebody
[33:47.360 --> 33:52.440]  who knows what the hell they're doing when they're drawing can do and they
[33:52.440 --> 33:55.920]  were really nice but it was real dark over there and then stage right you went
[33:55.920 --> 34:01.360]  down a hallway and it was like you were entering a temporary Apple store and the
[34:01.360 --> 34:04.120]  most amazing thing is as you came down that hallway it looked like it was
[34:04.120 --> 34:08.080]  flooded with sunlight did you notice that yeah I didn't actually I didn't
[34:08.080 --> 34:10.880]  pick up that it was sunlight but there was almost like a golden glow coming in
[34:10.880 --> 34:15.020]  as you walk through the room I was waiting to get in and I look and it was
[34:15.020 --> 34:18.520]  flooded with sunlight and I thought the one time remember at one time Apple cut
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.600]  a hole in the wall at the Urbana Sweater Center to get sunlight in there and I
[34:22.600 --> 34:25.520]  thought oh they must have cut a hole in the roof and then I thought no wait that
[34:25.520 --> 34:30.400]  doesn't make any sense because the Bill Graham Center has like three floors
[34:30.400 --> 34:35.120]  above above the floor they were on and it just they put in like some kind of
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.280]  you know fancy lighting system that gives off light in the color temperature
[34:40.280 --> 34:45.320]  of sunlight you gotta wonder if that was home kit there's just some guy there
[34:45.320 --> 34:49.400]  with Siri controlling all of it I don't know but again I think it's sort of like
[34:49.400 --> 34:53.400]  a movie you know movie studio quality lighting absolutely like the sort of
[34:53.400 --> 34:58.560]  thing that I'm that a TV show or movie would use to simulate you know sunlight
[34:58.560 --> 35:03.720]  without having to you know actually have sunlight again that's all of them they
[35:03.720 --> 35:06.240]  don't have an external events team like some people do like they don't hire
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.760]  anyone to put this together for them that's all internal yeah and it's you
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.160]  know incredibly impressive you know I thought so I agree completely the other
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.080]  thing that was interesting and you and I talked about this is even with the
[35:19.080 --> 35:24.440]  seating for 1400 they did not greatly expand in fact I think they might have
[35:24.440 --> 35:29.640]  contracted the number of media and analysts who were invited in other words
[35:29.640 --> 35:33.560]  outsiders non Apple people who were invited to the event so I heard and I
[35:33.560 --> 35:36.280]  don't I didn't hear the official list but I heard that the constraint wasn't
[35:36.280 --> 35:40.000]  the seating of the arena but the capacity of the on-hands area that you
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.600]  just couldn't have that many people in the Apple TV and the iPad testing areas
[35:45.600 --> 35:48.840]  at one time and that limited how many because you can't just have a bunch of
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.240]  media people there and just never let them in so they had to figure out that
[35:52.240 --> 35:55.200]  number then that's as many presses they could invite and then the rest they used
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.400]  for engineers yeah that actually I did not hear that but that makes my
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.920]  experience my first-hand experience make that makes total sense to me because I
[36:04.920 --> 36:12.280]  stayed until they also politely asked like those of us remaining to leave and
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.200]  in the old days that trick used to get you some really good hands-on time with
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.400]  stuff I remember like when I remember very specifically and it's just funny
[36:21.400 --> 36:27.000]  because you know apples back to having a keyboard you can latch on to an iPad the
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.680]  first iPad it was so hard to get time with them and you know you really just
[36:31.680 --> 36:35.320]  felt like there's so many people waiting at every table that after you did get
[36:35.320 --> 36:38.760]  some time and got to play with some things that it would occur to you it was
[36:38.760 --> 36:41.640]  so many people you just felt like a jerk if you didn't hand it back over to the
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.280]  Apple rep and and you know go take you know get line again somewhere else or
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.840]  think about new things to do but by the end of that hands-on session Dan Morin
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.880]  and I had an iPad with the hardware the original hardware keyboard thing to
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.480]  ourselves for who I don't know like a good like 15 under uninterrupted minutes
[36:58.480 --> 37:02.400]  and you know we got to play with as many things as we could test out keyboard
[37:02.400 --> 37:06.880]  shortcuts and you know it was fantastic and there was nobody over our shoulder
[37:06.880 --> 37:12.440]  because most people left that's not the case anymore like it was crowded and and
[37:12.440 --> 37:16.840]  hard to get time with stuff up right up until they they asked us to leave yeah
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.640]  no absolutely and that's with just the people they didn't fight so and I heard
[37:21.640 --> 37:26.000]  also that they tried to have much more international balance in the in the
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  media presence this time as well and when you look through the media it was
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.680]  obvious that there were people from you know Europe the Asia yeah just
[37:32.680 --> 37:36.360]  everywhere yeah a lot of people from Europe clearly and a lot of people from
[37:36.360 --> 37:43.360]  Asia clearly yeah and the story I heard about that was that for years what they
[37:43.360 --> 37:46.840]  used to do is run simulcasts around the world I don't know how many but let's
[37:46.840 --> 37:52.440]  say they'd have one in London and they'd have one somewhere in Asia maybe more
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.680]  than those two maybe more but you know at least you know one in Asia and one in
[37:56.680 --> 38:03.200]  London and that way people wouldn't have to fly as far someone from Germany would
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.600]  only have to travel to London and Apple has PR staff in those you know on those
[38:08.600 --> 38:11.920]  continents already and if those Pete that PR staff could could man those
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.760]  events but they were all here this year yeah well the gist of what I heard is
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.360]  that more and more that people from around the world even with the expense
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.160]  and time of traveling wanted to be at the real show they didn't want to watch
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.560]  on a screen at the same time they wanted to be at the show and as more and more
[38:29.560 --> 38:34.520]  people were you know those the media people were asking for that it left less
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.440]  and less reason for them to simulcast it and so they didn't anybody who wanted to
[38:38.440 --> 38:43.000]  be there was here but that meant though that you know the 400 spots for
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.280]  outsiders had to be split from everybody around the world and conversely they had
[38:47.280 --> 38:50.500]  so many products like they had the all-new Apple watch stuff they had the
[38:50.500 --> 38:54.120]  iPad they had the Apple TV they had the iPhones and those those teams aren't big
[38:54.120 --> 38:58.200]  like the press teams the marketing teams as far as I could tell there were people
[38:58.200 --> 39:01.120]  they were being manned by people from all over the world like that if you
[39:01.120 --> 39:03.440]  worked at Apple in those departments anywhere in the world you were there
[39:03.440 --> 39:10.200]  helping out that day yeah definitely just wild it just an incredible
[39:10.200 --> 39:13.760]  incredible effort that goes into it whatever you think of the announcements
[39:13.760 --> 39:19.160]  I mean just the meta commentary on the effort Apple puts into the show itself
[39:19.160 --> 39:24.080]  is it's truly extraordinary and it's they've taken it to to a level with this
[39:24.080 --> 39:27.760]  show I think that they've never done before yeah it's almost like I don't
[39:27.760 --> 39:30.200]  know you mentioned before that the idea that Apple was a product but it's almost
[39:30.200 --> 39:33.920]  like the events themselves have become products and I've gotten to go to shows
[39:33.920 --> 39:37.800]  by other companies and when you see the difference in how they're staged like I
[39:37.800 --> 39:41.080]  won't mention any names but some of them don't even think about streaming it it
[39:41.080 --> 39:43.800]  doesn't occur to them as they're setting it up and then there's massive problems
[39:43.800 --> 39:48.520]  at the last minute or they do simulcasts and one starts before the other and then
[39:48.520 --> 39:52.080]  I remember one year I forget London New York started early so these they started
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.800]  handing out phones to keep reporters busy while they were trying to get the
[39:55.800 --> 39:58.520]  satellite back and those reporters started blocking the phones immediately
[39:58.520 --> 40:01.920]  like there's just so many things that could go wrong and that and that these
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.040]  tend to go right as a testament to the effort put in yeah and it seems like you
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.240]  know the streaming held up once again very well for everybody out you know at
[40:10.240 --> 40:13.200]  home everybody out there listening I bet you know probably a majority of the
[40:13.200 --> 40:16.000]  people listening to this episode probably listen live and it seemed like
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.520]  there were very few if any complaints about the streaming yeah I mean
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.440]  accidents and bad things happen to everybody I think it's a testament to a
[40:23.440 --> 40:26.440]  company that they often do not let the same bad thing how are the same mistakes
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.520]  happen twice right nobody got switched to the Chinese audio track or something
[40:30.520 --> 40:36.080]  like that no anything else you want to talk about from that from the event
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.520]  yeah it was interesting to me is when we talked to a bunch of our friends about
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.960]  it how split some of the opinions are I know there was a little bit of that at
[40:43.960 --> 40:47.440]  WWDC because some people actually did like the music stuff a lot of us didn't
[40:47.440 --> 40:50.960]  but some people did and this year there was nothing as divisive as that but
[40:50.960 --> 40:54.300]  there were still some people like I know Jeff Williams owns Apple watched at
[40:54.300 --> 40:58.000]  Apple it's in his org but he presented it and it wasn't Phil Schiller and some
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.620]  people like the fresh new voice and some people would prefer to have Phil do all
[41:01.620 --> 41:04.900]  those things and some people don't find Phil excited enough so they like Craig
[41:04.900 --> 41:08.000]  with some people think Craig is just a bunch of dad jokes and then like there's
[41:08.000 --> 41:11.440]  just so many opinions now about who should be doing what and I think that
[41:11.440 --> 41:14.600]  almost shows that they're getting to a level where we're not worrying about
[41:14.600 --> 41:19.120]  their products as much anymore and we're worrying about Apple as a show yeah it's
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.880]  I you know I don't get the complaints about Schiller and I know that there's
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.080]  some people who you know like Twitter and email are like what's wrong with
[41:27.080 --> 41:32.040]  Schiller was he depressed you know I like his demeanor on stage I think I
[41:32.040 --> 41:39.760]  think it's very carefully dialed in and it is it is very much it's I don't find
[41:39.760 --> 41:44.520]  it to be lacking in enthusiasm I find it to be completely without artificial
[41:44.520 --> 41:51.120]  enthusiasm absolutely and you know even Federighi who's who is more
[41:51.120 --> 41:54.960]  enthusiastic I don't find it to be phony though I really do think though that
[41:54.960 --> 42:00.160]  that's exactly what he thinks he's just more of a jovial guy than than Schiller
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.000]  is they're all as far as I can tell and you spent a lot more time than I have
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.400]  but they come off offstage the same way they come off on stage yes very much so
[42:08.400 --> 42:15.960]  in my experience very much so even Eddie too it's you know he is he's you know
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.680]  you think well that guy might be a little goofy he is a little goofy it's
[42:19.680 --> 42:25.280]  funny like runs iTunes he has to be you wouldn't you know and and the idea like
[42:25.280 --> 42:32.680]  when you hear that Steve Jobs and Tim Cook are ferociously scary negotiators
[42:32.680 --> 42:37.680]  it's believable and when you hear it about Eddie based on his onstage
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.520]  demeanor it does seem hard to imagine are you can't I can't imagine it but he
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.680]  you know hey I think if there's ever any place where he's got like a different
[42:46.680 --> 42:49.720]  demeanor it's when he's at the negotiating table it is different
[42:49.720 --> 42:54.660]  clearly different than his his stage demeanor and is you know if you if you
[42:54.660 --> 42:58.200]  say hi to him you know backstage or something like that must be so disarming
[42:58.200 --> 43:00.760]  because if someone comes in like they're Darth Vader you're preparing yourself
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.320]  for Darth Vader but if someone comes in as your best friend then all of a sudden
[43:04.320 --> 43:07.880]  all the oxygen gets sucked out of the room you're just not ready for that
[43:07.880 --> 43:15.880]  I saw one complaint I saw an article that somebody wrote about that I didn't
[43:15.880 --> 43:18.960]  think I linked on I almost did not because I agreed with it but in the
[43:18.960 --> 43:23.360]  spirit of sometimes I like to link to things I disagree with but that I find
[43:23.360 --> 43:28.920]  worth considering it's like the rarest thing it was an article about that
[43:28.920 --> 43:33.720]  called Apple's event creepy as hell yeah and one of his complaints was that it
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.480]  was just one guy after another all dressed the same with the exact same
[43:37.480 --> 43:42.720]  almost the exact same shirt on and I I see what he means we actually commented
[43:42.720 --> 43:45.720]  on it in the show it almost seems like maybe Apple needs to coordinate that a
[43:45.720 --> 43:50.200]  little bit better that was you know it really was a series of very similar
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.920]  bluish with you know muted dark blue button-down
[43:54.920 --> 43:59.080]  Eddie had his product red shirt on well that's the thing I don't see how you I
[43:59.080 --> 44:06.920]  see how you can complain and I see how Tim and Jeff Williams and Schiller and a
[44:06.920 --> 44:13.400]  few others had roughly similar shirts on I don't see though how you write that
[44:13.400 --> 44:20.920]  sentence without at least putting in a parenthetical about Eddie like Eddie's
[44:20.920 --> 44:27.480]  shirt was so crazily Eddie that it it it demanded to be mentioned if you're going
[44:27.480 --> 44:30.960]  to talk about the shirts of the people on stage you got it you really had to
[44:30.960 --> 44:39.840]  mention that I almost think like Eddie this is going in like like you remember
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.240]  Doc Severinsen the guy yeah fan leader on the Johnny Carson absolutely he wore
[44:44.240 --> 44:48.520]  deliberately outlandish costumes and Carson could crack jokes about it like I
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.440]  feel like Eddie's going in that route or he he he's just wears he wears goofy
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.560]  shirts on purpose it's part of the negotiating he distracts you with the
[44:56.560 --> 44:59.240]  shirt and then goes in for the kill right because he actually didn't have
[44:59.240 --> 45:04.520]  that shirt on before the event you know like pre event apples senior executives
[45:04.520 --> 45:11.880]  mingle down in front in front of the stage you know like in the you know half
[45:11.880 --> 45:16.360]  hour 45 minutes leading up to the event and and I saw you know Eddie down there
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.520]  and he was wearing I don't know what it was I didn't really take notice but I
[45:19.520 --> 45:22.400]  certainly would have taken notice if he was wearing that shirt and he wasn't
[45:22.400 --> 45:27.360]  like so he actually gets into costume backstage like to come out I joked about
[45:27.360 --> 45:30.200]  this but I seriously want to just turn off the internet often after Apple
[45:30.200 --> 45:33.640]  events I saw a whole thing about how Johnny I've didn't appear physically in
[45:33.640 --> 45:37.040]  the video and there must be something wrong but we saw him all over the event
[45:37.040 --> 45:41.360]  he was he was exactly like Johnny always was yes exactly no he was all over the
[45:41.360 --> 45:46.000]  place afterwards no there's nothing right stupid it's the fact that the fact
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.320]  is that they've upped they've well it's I guess it's a matter of taste whether
[45:52.320 --> 45:58.120]  they've upped the style of those narrated videos but they have seemingly
[45:58.120 --> 46:04.520]  abandoned the previous I'm gonna call it a format but you want to call it a style
[46:04.520 --> 46:10.600]  like template where it's the white background that that seemingly infinite
[46:10.600 --> 46:18.520]  white universe background and you'd see the people doing the talking you know
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.640]  oh I think they were always on the right side looking to the left if you're
[46:23.640 --> 46:28.160]  looking at the screen and you know this site like as though they were film doing
[46:28.160 --> 46:32.200]  a sit-down interview and instead now it's a black background and they're
[46:32.200 --> 46:40.280]  darker and it's entirely shots of the products and pure voiceover from Johnny
[46:40.280 --> 46:43.400]  I and just Johnny there's I mean they don't have Dan Riccio they used to have
[46:43.400 --> 46:47.560]  these have a bunch of people in those ads they don't have Johnny Saruji it's
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.280]  entirely a Johnny I but you know it was getting to the point where people were
[46:50.280 --> 46:53.000]  making fake versions of those and I think once you have your seven a live
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.520]  moment you've got to move on yeah I think maybe that's part of it and that
[46:56.520 --> 47:01.000]  you know they just got old you know what's-his-name Big Bob yes fans feel
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.560]  yeah Mansfield appeal appeared on them as Dan Riccio was in some of them I mean
[47:04.560 --> 47:07.560]  they've had several people they've had Jaws we act in some of them yes
[47:07.560 --> 47:14.840]  definitely I always liked seeing Big Bob Mansfield he was great he just seems so
[47:14.840 --> 47:18.640]  nice are you really a lot of them like they really do come off the way they
[47:18.640 --> 47:21.520]  come off in those videos I think they really do enjoy what they're doing yes
[47:21.520 --> 47:24.720]  well absolutely I don't see if there's any other reason that they would stick
[47:24.720 --> 47:31.640]  around Oh I'm trying to think anything else with the event no just that it was
[47:31.640 --> 47:34.700]  I mean we spoke about it briefly before the event and we said if they if they
[47:34.700 --> 47:37.240]  were gonna do all this stuff they were gonna have to yada yada a lot of things
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.360]  and they did they yada yada a lot of things yeah they definitely they cut a
[47:40.360 --> 47:42.920]  lot of stuff like there was apparently a lot more stuff that just couldn't fit in
[47:42.920 --> 47:50.960]  yeah I heard no I'm curious who does that because previously it was without
[47:50.960 --> 47:56.240]  question it was Steve Jobs he was the director of those shows and it was on
[47:56.240 --> 48:02.000]  questioned it and he had a gift and you know they were easier to put together
[48:02.000 --> 48:08.280]  when he was around because his gift was such that if you laid out the products
[48:08.280 --> 48:13.520]  that here's the stuff we'd like to announce here's all of it jobs can just
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.880]  look at that table of stuff whether it's software you know hardware whatever the
[48:17.880 --> 48:24.880]  mix is and the show just came to his head like the basic structure what do we
[48:24.880 --> 48:30.840]  do first what do we do second what do we do third what gets cut and it just came
[48:30.840 --> 48:33.520]  to him and it's not that they came to him and then they didn't have to rehearse
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.840]  and you know then they'd start rehearsing and as they're rehearsing the
[48:37.840 --> 48:42.200]  flaws in the flow the lulls and everything just came to him and he would
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.720]  just say that's that's too long that's got to be 30 seconds and that's it and
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.000]  nobody you know there weren't really arguments over it went and somebody
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.680]  who's maybe stuck see the end the thing that that really sticks out to me when
[48:55.680 --> 49:00.760]  you watch other companies events is that the inner company politics just come
[49:00.760 --> 49:07.160]  spewing out the sides of the event in terms of you can just see that it's this
[49:07.160 --> 49:11.880]  division and that division and they both want time on the stage and they want it
[49:11.880 --> 49:16.040]  for the sake of their own internal
[49:17.360 --> 49:25.480]  bureaucratic status yeah not whether giving equal time or ten minutes of time
[49:25.480 --> 49:29.600]  to this other thing is good for the flow of the show and therefore therefore best
[49:29.600 --> 49:33.000]  for the for the interest of the company as a whole in terms of keeping people's
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.760]  interest in making sure that the limited time of this event is allocated properly
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.400]  and I think you know Steve Jobs could single-handedly solve that because who
[49:42.400 --> 49:46.960]  whatever internal quabbles there were in turf wars under him the buck stopped
[49:46.960 --> 49:51.880]  with him and he could stop it Tim Cook obviously has that authority and I think
[49:51.880 --> 49:55.520]  it would be unquestioned but he doesn't have I don't think he's the guy who has
[49:55.520 --> 49:59.840]  the sense of showmanship to know you know which stuff to put in which order
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.560]  and stuff like that and I really do think that's what was wrong with the
[50:03.560 --> 50:09.360]  WWDC keynote is that it was just sort of a jumble and sort of randomly structured
[50:09.360 --> 50:13.880]  as opposed to ordered in a way that was harmonious yeah to your point I felt
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.320]  like Steve Jobs could look at one of those weird you know those weird
[50:16.320 --> 50:19.320]  paintings and just see the pattern that was hidden inside it it would just pop
[50:19.320 --> 50:23.280]  out at me you'd wonder why no else could see it it's so obvious and now Tim Cook
[50:23.280 --> 50:26.560]  seems to treat them where before it was Steve Jobs and Johnny I've and
[50:26.560 --> 50:29.400]  everything radiating out from there Tim Cook seems to treat them as if they're
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.440]  running their own sub companies in a way and it feels like you know just running
[50:33.440 --> 50:36.720]  watch who does Jeff want to present the watch if he wants to that's fine if not
[50:36.720 --> 50:41.640]  we'll find somebody Eddie's gonna do the iTunes or segment if he doesn't want to
[50:41.640 --> 50:44.640]  do parts of it who's gonna do those and they get to make those decisions and
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.440]  maybe arguably you'd want Tim Cook or Johnny I have to make some of those
[50:48.440 --> 50:52.180]  decisions but he seems content to allow them to own those fields yeah but not if
[50:52.180 --> 50:56.560]  he doesn't if he I think one of the I think one of the seemingly amazing
[50:56.560 --> 51:03.160]  things about Tim Cook is that he seems extraordinarily comfortable sticking to
[51:03.160 --> 51:07.240]  what he's good at and yet knowing what he's good at and he's clearly very very
[51:07.240 --> 51:13.720]  good at certain things and then not not feeling the least bit defensive or
[51:13.720 --> 51:18.580]  inadequate about the things that he's not good at even though those are some
[51:18.580 --> 51:23.140]  amazing things that his immediate predecessor was amazingly good at like
[51:23.140 --> 51:28.420]  it I don't think it bothers Tim Cook in the least that he's not he doesn't have
[51:28.420 --> 51:31.640]  that sense of showmanship that Steve Jobs had and he's running a very
[51:31.640 --> 51:34.400]  different Apple yeah and clearly it doesn't bother him at least that he
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.280]  doesn't have the sense of design that Steve Jobs had I mean I'm sure Tim Cook
[51:38.280 --> 51:42.880]  offers feedback and he's very very tuned in to the development of these products
[51:42.880 --> 51:46.300]  and I think if he does have an opinion or a question I don't think I'm sure he
[51:46.300 --> 51:50.080]  doesn't hesitate to ask but he doesn't have any problem letting Johnny I've
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.920]  take over as the the buck stops here sense of design for the company one of
[51:55.920 --> 51:59.440]  my favorite moments during the event was Tim Cook walked into the Apple TV area
[51:59.440 --> 52:03.640]  with one Republic and he wanted to show them an iPad or they were asking about
[52:03.640 --> 52:07.240]  the iPad prone it wasn't in that area but there were a group of people some of
[52:07.240 --> 52:10.240]  the guides there had them so one of the guides offered it to him he just picked
[52:10.240 --> 52:13.880]  it up and started giving a complete hands-on demo to one Republic showing
[52:13.880 --> 52:16.760]  them the features almost like he was working at an Apple store it was
[52:16.760 --> 52:22.120]  remarkable yeah I was nearby I actually saw that until they wandered off but
[52:22.120 --> 52:30.440]  yeah it's his knowledge of what's being announced is as deep as it could be like
[52:30.440 --> 52:33.600]  you know if he needed to he could do everything I mean it would take forever
[52:33.600 --> 52:37.360]  because he talks so slow but well it seems like he doesn't drive design the
[52:37.360 --> 52:39.980]  way Steve Jobs did now he does appreciate the details of what they do
[52:39.980 --> 52:44.480]  yeah or and he pays attention to what they do yeah he is very much aware of it
[52:44.480 --> 52:50.560]  like that's there's no glossing over on on that stuff event wise though it that
[52:50.560 --> 52:54.120]  probably wraps it up all right I'll take another break here and we talk about our
[52:54.120 --> 52:59.520]  next sponsor and it is our very good friends at back plays back plays does
[52:59.520 --> 53:07.640]  online backup for your Mac or your PC they've got PC I've heard I don't know
[53:07.640 --> 53:14.720]  but more or less what you do is you install back plays on your Mac or your
[53:14.720 --> 53:24.480]  PC I guess and you get a free demo risk-free no credit card turn it on sign
[53:24.480 --> 53:29.240]  up and it just starts uploading everything on your computer to back
[53:29.240 --> 53:34.200]  places online storage everything you have an external hard drive back set up
[53:34.200 --> 53:40.920]  to oh but it's you know three terabytes nope they'll back it up there's no magic
[53:40.920 --> 53:46.000]  to it like whatever your upstream internet connection is from your home or
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.920]  your office to the internet is going to limit how long that initial backup takes
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.340]  there's they don't have any kind of magic involved that's gonna get two
[53:55.340 --> 54:00.480]  terabytes uploaded in an hour so it might take a while it might take days
[54:00.480 --> 54:05.320]  but they know that and it's like engineered with that mind it and and the
[54:05.320 --> 54:09.200]  other thing they do too is they don't just blindly take all of your upstream
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.120]  bandwidth it's not like your computer is I honestly I've done it I've just
[54:13.120 --> 54:17.440]  reinstalled it on a couple of new machines within the last few months and
[54:17.440 --> 54:22.200]  gone through the first the first run of using back plays you don't notice that
[54:22.200 --> 54:26.360]  it's running you don't notice that it's doing the initial backup it's not like
[54:26.360 --> 54:30.000]  you know all of a sudden everything else on your computer is slow it just works
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.720]  it's worked and it's written by people who who who use it and know what it's
[54:34.720 --> 54:40.080]  meant for anyway once everything's uploaded and and there and you have a
[54:40.080 --> 54:44.280]  complete backup it just silently runs in the background and slowly you know as
[54:44.280 --> 54:49.800]  you make changes and add stuff just keeps it up to date it is a remarkable
[54:49.800 --> 54:55.840]  remarkable service and it's it's just an unbelievable price there are no add-ons
[54:55.840 --> 54:58.560]  there's no gimmicks there's no additional charges it's not like you get
[54:58.560 --> 55:03.520]  a terabyte free and then you have to pay for more or whatever you just pay five
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.560]  dollars per month per computer and you get unlimited on throttled backup it's
[55:08.560 --> 55:13.880]  just unbelievable when you want to get files back what do you do you can just
[55:13.880 --> 55:17.320]  log in if you just need one file maybe you're you know on your iPhone you can
[55:17.320 --> 55:21.200]  use their app and just get access to one file from your Mac from anywhere you are
[55:21.200 --> 55:27.800]  in the world and then email it or do whatever you want with it 25% of all of
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.480]  the restores from black blaze customers are just one file at a time but if you
[55:33.480 --> 55:38.200]  need everything back you can order a USB hard drive and it'll just show up you
[55:38.200 --> 55:43.880]  know by overnight with everything on it can't can't be better so stop putting it
[55:43.880 --> 55:47.680]  off you'll feel if you're not backing up offline even if you have backups right
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.260]  there in your in your office in your house local backups to another hard
[55:51.260 --> 55:57.000]  drive which is great I do too just just you'll feel so much better with an
[55:57.000 --> 56:00.480]  off-site backup to the camp you can't back up to enough different places and
[56:00.480 --> 56:03.720]  if you want to get it back up that's in the cloud office off-site I can't
[56:03.720 --> 56:09.800]  recommend anything better than back place go to back blaze comm slash the
[56:09.800 --> 56:14.840]  talk show and they'll know that you came from the show and check them out install
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.880]  it now don't don't put it off really just pause pause this podcast and go get
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.880]  started install it get it started it'll take you like five minutes and then come
[56:23.880 --> 56:31.400]  back and listen to the rest of the show all right so I guess we could talk about
[56:31.400 --> 56:36.760]  what they announced at the show yeah I'm curious what you think of the iPad Pro
[56:36.760 --> 56:40.620]  with the pen because you are maybe not you know you know serious illustrator
[56:40.620 --> 56:44.040]  but you're certainly a hobbyist illustrator or at least you're a Batman
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.940]  illustrator well so I I do that to screw around but my one of them I drew every
[56:48.940 --> 56:52.960]  day like comic book II stuff when I was growing up and I went to college for art
[56:52.960 --> 56:57.880]  and then I worked as a designer for seven eight years using Wacom tablets
[56:57.880 --> 57:02.280]  every day and doing Photoshop and illustrator and in design just
[57:02.280 --> 57:05.720]  constantly until I became muscle memory and though I had a love-hate
[57:05.720 --> 57:09.080]  relationship with those because they were better than anything else but they
[57:09.080 --> 57:14.960]  were never exactly a digital pen and Apple's pencil is it's remarkable if I'm
[57:14.960 --> 57:19.000]  sure if you just used it you'd find that too but if you've been using Wacom for a
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.440]  while or you've used stylus is on the iPad it's hard to it's hard to properly
[57:22.440 --> 57:26.120]  frame the difference but it just never felt like a proper pen to me it wasn't
[57:26.120 --> 57:30.360]  heavy enough it was too slippery and Apple's fixed all of that there is no
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.120]  paper drag but they've got a material on the tip of the pencil that has just
[57:34.120 --> 57:37.560]  enough drag on the screen that makes you feel like it's a real thing that there's
[57:37.560 --> 57:41.640]  real contact there and the weight is absolutely perfect and the way that it
[57:41.640 --> 57:46.320]  they do this really fancy sort of prediction algorithm for where you're
[57:46.320 --> 57:49.520]  gonna go and once in a while you cannot you can you can fool it but it catches
[57:49.520 --> 57:53.280]  up super quick but it makes you feel like you're literally drawing right on
[57:53.280 --> 57:56.680]  the screen and because there's no intermediating lot layer the way there
[57:56.680 --> 58:00.240]  is with Wacom they have a whole layer between the display and and the sensors
[58:00.240 --> 58:04.720]  it feels like you are drawing those pixels into the glass and I used it for
[58:04.720 --> 58:07.720]  about I did the same thing that you did I went there at the end and I used it
[58:07.720 --> 58:11.640]  for about 20 minutes and I put my hand down on it to test palm rejection I did
[58:11.640 --> 58:15.120]  very quick cross hatching and she wanted to gave me a whole long list of things
[58:15.120 --> 58:19.040]  to test too because she did all the stylus reviews and I did everything I
[58:19.040 --> 58:22.560]  could to screw that thing over and it kept with me and it was the first time I
[58:22.560 --> 58:25.680]  actually felt like I could sit there with a pad of paper and sketch on a
[58:25.680 --> 58:29.600]  digital device yeah that that's something that didn't really occur to me
[58:29.600 --> 58:32.640]  during the event I thought I was thinking of it and try I mean obviously
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.520]  you know it was rumored that it was you know a big iPad and and it would there
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.640]  would be some kind of optional stylus type thing attached to it so drawing was
[58:40.640 --> 58:44.520]  obviously part of it it hadn't occurred to me though that they weren't just
[58:44.520 --> 58:51.640]  going for a better stylus on iPad experience than what was possible with
[58:51.640 --> 59:00.520]  third-party styluses until now and that instead they were going to take like the
[59:00.520 --> 59:05.240]  Wacom stuff and make it look bad you know that this is the preeminent
[59:05.240 --> 59:10.960]  computerized drawing thing in the world period it just didn't occur to me until
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.760]  afterwards in the hands-on area when I was walking around with Michael B
[59:15.760 --> 59:22.960]  Johnson aka dr. wave on Twitter honestly I've I forewent firsthand experience
[59:22.960 --> 59:28.440]  with the with the iPad and pen cuz like we said that the hands-on area was
[59:28.440 --> 59:34.740]  crowded I've forewent doing that myself just to hang with dr. wave and listen to
[59:34.740 --> 59:40.500]  his questions he was a guest you know you know but you know what he does at
[59:40.500 --> 59:47.200]  Pixar is build internal tools for Pixar artists and this device is of great
[59:47.200 --> 59:51.160]  interest to him and to listen to his questions about refresh rates and
[59:51.160 --> 59:56.760]  parallax and and and all of that stuff I felt like I learned more by letting you
[59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.340]  know just sort of being a you know just looking over his shoulder really really
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.920]  fascinating so and it became clear in that aftermath that that's really what
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:14.080]  Apple had done is that this is you know a dramatic step forward in terms of
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.080]  drawing you know for any kind of artist it's one of those things where they see
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.920]  an area where something is just not as good as they want it to be and if they
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.000]  believe that they can make a difference they're gonna go all out and try and do
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.880]  it and they doubled the refresh the scanning rate inside the Mac sorry the
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.640]  iPad Pro so it technically doesn't work on older generation iPads though they
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.800]  could update the hardware eventually for that but they're combining that with
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:39.000]  technology like the the force touch or 3d touch inside the pencil and a lot of
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.080]  smarts for tilt direction positioning and they're measuring on a bunch of
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.480]  different axes and they've got all the software behind that too and it really
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.080]  it feels like magic and that's a really dumb thing to say but they're doing so
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.160]  much computational work there that the end it ends up just feeling like a
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.520]  pencil yeah there was a blog post I long to yesterday written by Linda Dong who
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.080]  now admittedly she's a former Apple designer so if you wanted to say she's
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.560]  biased you can but she's former well because if she was present she wouldn't
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.520]  be blogging about it but she's done interaction design and stuff for Apple
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.800]  and does a lot of her work has done a lot of her work on on the Wacom Cintiqs
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:21.160]  I thought her little just quick like here's all the ways that this is better
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.360]  it was amazing so the Cintiqs aren't retina so they have pixels that an
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:30.880]  artist can see the pen she says you know the pen you use with them is janky and
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.800]  it feels junky and has a bunch of buttons you can actually hit there's
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.960]  parallax between the surface of the thing and the actual display underneath
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.120]  which for almost any angle that would be comfortable for an artist is going to be
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.200]  an issue and there there's latency there's there's palpable latency yes so
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.280]  combine those this is highlights of here's how this thing is better it's
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.280]  blowaway good and you can almost see them the way that they did with the
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.520]  smartphone and they looked at the existing marketing said what are the
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.520]  problems what are the pain points and can we fix them and they made that list
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.920]  and they just knock them down one after the other yeah my question here's my big
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.960]  question about all of this though is and and obviously there's you know however
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:18.680]  many other uses for for the iPad Pro but how big is the market for making the pen
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:24.720]  work as well as this is I have no idea how big that market is yeah I don't know
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.000]  either I mean there are a lot of people who went out and bought Microsoft
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.840]  services just because they wanted to do this kind of illustration work and
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.200]  that's you know obviously it wasn't enough to make the surface successful
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.320]  product but it was interesting to me that there was that demand and I don't
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.360]  think I think sometimes Apple just wants to do what they think is better and they
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.880]  know that that technology will trickle down like maybe in the future an iPad
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.600]  Air and iPad mini maybe even an iPhone will benefit from this technology but it
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.960]  takes they're launching a big product to bring everything together to make it a
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.000]  reality right because there's a there's all the magic that's in the pen and in
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.360]  theory that that you know the pen could work you know with any other device but
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:05.080]  there's also new technology in the iPad Pro itself that works with the pen for
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:09.280]  getting the you know the pressure sensitivity and stuff like that like
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.740]  however thin the layer now is in a modern device on the modern Apple
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:20.840]  devices between this the actual display and the surface of the glass above it
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:25.200]  however thin that is and I really do think they're not exaggerating to call
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.600]  that gap microscopic mm-hmm they've got sensors in there to measure at
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.000]  microscopic levels the the degree of pressure that's you know that's being
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.520]  twice the resolution of the ones in the iPad Air and the iPhone apparently yeah
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.320]  yeah and they do magical stuff now with the with the refresh rate where if they
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.980]  sense that you're not doing anything that's that's very dynamic they can
[01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.600]  cycle that down to save power there's a lot of technology in that display yeah
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:55.000]  and I think that they've again I'm I think they've they've they've improved
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.400]  refresh rates in two ways there's the drawing refresh rate where just what
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.280]  it's displaying what the what the iPad Pro is displaying has this dynamic
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.960]  visual refresh rate so if you're watching a video where everything is
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.120]  changing all the time it's you know refreshing at whatever rate but if this
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.720]  you know it stops if you're drawing something and you stop and it detects
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.080]  that you've stopped and nothing is animated on screen it'll slow it down
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:26.160]  and that can you know definitely save any energy but I also believe if not
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.200]  know that they have doubled the refresh rate of reading the touch sensors yeah
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.440]  right and so as even if you're just drawing your with your finger even if
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.920]  you're just sliding your finger over it it's got double the refresh rate of
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.320]  checking just where your finger is yeah and it all comes together like to
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.680]  Linda's post that it just does so many things that no one else is doing right
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:51.680]  now because they're hard things to do that all those refresh rate things
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.360]  those seem like things that could couldn't will eventually trickle down
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:00.360]  to across the whole iOS lineup I mean why not I mean whether they'll work with
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.120]  the pen I don't know but at the very least you know you know increasing the
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.880]  touch refresh rate you know seems like it would be just as you know useful and
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.160]  in ways to any iPad and phone there is so much I mean they've they've shown
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.680]  their own custom timing controllers for things like the 5k iMac and now for the
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.400]  iPad Pro they've shown that new chip that lets them flash the iPhone screen
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:25.200]  three times as bright to make a selfie flash they've they've shown they can do
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.880]  OLED with the Apple watch and keep things a super low refresh rate sorry
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.960]  super low super super efficient energy rates where they're going with all this
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.200]  the thing that it's always so impressive to me is that Apple they're not like
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.360]  Qualcomm and they're not even quite like Samsung they get to make the parts
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.520]  exactly for what they want to do so you take a look at like the a9 processor and
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.600]  to me this is light years ahead of the rest of the industry now and if you told
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.040]  me ten years ago Apple would be leading in any chipset business I would have
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.240]  thought it was insane but they're doing it and they're they don't have to care
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.840]  about profit or loss on a chipset like Qualcomm does because they're not
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.080]  selling them they don't have to worry about supporting Microsoft and Android
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.200]  and other architectures because they're only supporting their own if they want
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.680]  to make a feature like like this they can just make the silicon that supports
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:10.480]  it and I think that over time that becomes a stronger and stronger advantage
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:16.400]  for them I really do wonder and I know that like something like Geekbench is
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.480]  not it doesn't give you everything you know need to know about how fast one
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.560]  machine is comparable to another but it's not bad it's not a bad like
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.200]  starting point if you just want to put a number on it and I think Geekbench in
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.640]  particular is designed in a way that to me seems you know like a good balance of
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.720]  the various factors really really curious to see where the iPad Pro
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.520]  benchmarks because I said last week that I think it'll benchmark like it'll it
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:53.880]  might be like a 2013 MacBook Air it I'm wondering if I sold it short it might
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.960]  beat like the MacBook Air that you can go in and buy today I'm not maybe
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.360]  that's too much I don't know but I'm I'm pretty sure that it's gonna be close
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.520]  that's almost like apples and oranges now because again they are building the
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.140]  software and the hardware down to the chipset all to work together and you
[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.480]  don't see that like people will complain oh you know an iPhone needs more RAM
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.800]  androids got four gigabytes of RAM but that really is meaningless because
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.560]  they're running an interpreted language or in garbage collection they're not
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.880]  have they don't have sought they have software that's built for a wide set of
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.320]  devices not specifically if you're saying you need more RAM because Oh
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.520]  Safari can't keep a tab loaded in memory that's absolutely justified but their
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.880]  their ability to do this lets them pick and choose exactly the components that
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:38.520]  they need and I think that's where you get that performance from yeah it's just
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:45.600]  sort of astounding though I mean it's to go from where the iPad started in 2010
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.980]  and 2011 and it was a compelling advice a device especially starting with the
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:59.720]  iPad 2 in 2011 but not for reasons of pure performance compared to a Mac or
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:03.480]  even just like a MacBook Air which has always been you know the slowest Mac in
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:08.920]  the lineup it's for other reasons it was okay so it's not as fast but you can
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:15.360]  carry it around all day but it'll last ten hours but touch is more intimate and
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:21.040]  and it you know it sounds touchy-feely no pun intended but it really does give
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:25.560]  you a more intimate experience there were all these but it's kind of
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.240]  fascinating that performance is no longer a but yeah well you look at the
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:35.280]  the MacBook the brand-new MacBook that's running Broadwell why and it's hard to
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.240]  look at the Apple a9 and not think you know apples just sound like kicking
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:44.960]  their ass in mobile too it really does and again I think again we'll see maybe
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:49.960]  I'm wrong but if not if I'm wrong it's not gonna be my much that that the iPad
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:55.520]  Air 2 or not iPad Air 2 iPad Pro is going to benchmark faster than the
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.480]  Surface Pro 3s that are running Intel chips and and that was like the whole
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.720]  thing with the surface is that they had well we've got the regular surface which
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.320]  is arm and that's if you want something thinner and lighter and then we've got
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.980]  the Surface Pro which uses Intel's mobile chips because that's you know
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:19.280]  that's what you need for the speed and Apple has you know relevant relatively
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.520]  short order just like two years later has said you don't need to make that
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.960]  compromise you can get all the advantage all of the advantages of arm and beat
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.080]  Intel on performance I used to say this and people thought I was just being a
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:37.480]  dick but I meant it that when you look at the surface running Windows was not
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.680]  an advantage it was a detriment in many cases because Windows was just not
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.140]  designed to do that at all and iOS was and that's why I think Apple with their
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.980]  tablets and even with the iPad Pro gets that right I always wanted them to put
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.840]  before they started merging everything I always wanted to put Windows phone on a
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.280]  surface and see what it could really do but just the idea that this is a touch
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.800]  first mobile operating system built on a device that is mobile it gives them a
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:05.640]  tremendous advantage yeah I think so too the next thing in addition to the pencil
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  for the iPad Pro is the and here you know you can't not talk about the
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.180]  surface in this case is the smart keyboard or you've got a magnetically
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:21.280]  attached keyboard or cover that when you unfold it has a physical keyboard inside
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.120]  so much better than the original iPad with that keyboard stand oh absolutely
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.560]  but it's funny you know it's funny how you go around in it in five years it
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.240]  just looks like what the hell are they thinking but at the time they you know
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.520]  they didn't know you know it just didn't know but clearly this this is a smart
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.240]  keyboard is you know it's you know Microsoft did it first I mean so credit
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:55.360]  to them I'm curious why it's and I maybe the answer is just wait a year or maybe
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:58.280]  wait half a year who knows maybe there'll be an event I don't think me
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.360]  event this year but maybe they'll be like an early 2016 event why there's not
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:08.720]  one for the iPad air 2 and I know that it's full-size you know it's bigger and
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.440]  more comfortable and I've you know tried the ones in the demo area last week but
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.440]  it seems to me like an iPad air 2 is big enough for a keyboard my guess is they're
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.840]  waiting for the iPad air 3 which will have those same three connectors that
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.120]  the iPad Pro has that makes the docking and undocking so easy for the new
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.440]  keyboard that's exactly what I was thinking too exactly I think it's got to
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.600]  have those three it's got to have those three whatever they're calling a smart
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.960]  connector yeah smart connector look at me remembering the name of something I
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.840]  think it's got to be that they're waiting for an iPad air 3 it'll have the
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:47.560]  smart connector and it just wasn't ready yet and or maybe they didn't want to
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.680]  maybe they didn't want to release it yet yeah going back to your older point and
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.560]  the thing with Steve Jobs that was so great on stage is he could not he wasn't
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.960]  just that he saw the story and could arrange their products but he could tell
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.640]  you the story and maybe the original iPhone and the iPad 2 events were
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:04.120]  quintessential examples of that and I think this Apple knows that they're not
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.280]  quite as good at telling stories yet and you know absent that narrative I think
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.520]  that they have to be they have to be more focused and if they start talking
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.240]  about an iPad air with the keyboard or with a pencil it just takes away from
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.840]  the iPad Pro and they need to be very careful about keeping the focus on that
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.000]  one product yeah I think you're right I think it makes sense even if they could
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.720]  have done it now that it made sense to wait and maybe it will be maybe they'll
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:34.120]  go off cycle with iPad air 4 or I guess it would be iPad air 3 and maybe do it
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.560]  in the spring if they have something else to announce with it yeah it's
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.720]  interesting because the watch the watch debuted with watch OS one but watch OS
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.680]  two is coming out with the same hardware they're not they're not linking those
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.760]  products cycles so maybe they're willing to do that more often yeah and it's you
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.560]  know I don't think they're married to it and they kind of are with the iPhone
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.320]  it's convenient though I mean if the best time to show it off as WWDC and the
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.560]  best time to ship iPhones is in September and those things just line up
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.960]  very nicely for them yeah I think with something new like the watch it's it's
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.880]  so unpredictable or not what yeah well the watch is you know it's so
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.140]  unpredictable that it makes sense to just not worry about getting it on the
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:19.000]  exact quarter that you want it to come out on until they're more regularized
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.120]  you know production and everything absolutely and no no more about the you
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.120]  know and also they need a stag I mean those Apple like you said they have
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.560]  small teams and those teams are continuously running marathons of
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.700]  sprints and they have to like almost like you know when guy talks about the
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.880]  video game industry they have to be careful to to balance those people out
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.200]  because they will burn them if they're not careful yeah I totally agree with
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:53.080]  that so here's what's in our smart keyboard cover is 169 bucks yeah which
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:59.640]  is a lot really I mean especially since the starting price on the iPad lineup is
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.680]  now like $249 like you can get an iPad I mean it's you know it's the the old
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.200]  mini but you can get a whole iPad for $249 but the keyboard for the iPad Pro
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.040]  is a hundred and sixty nine bucks I think it's the most expensive Apple
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.520]  keyboard since my beloved Apple extended keyboard to the Microsoft Surface Pro
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:25.640]  type cover keyboard in Canadian dollar at least is 175 yeah I and it's you know
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.200]  I think it's a complicated bit of machinery so I and I think it feels like
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:40.520]  a valuable cover and obviously since the whole machine is 800 to $1,100 and I
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.160]  think I think most people who buy this are gonna get the $1,100 one they're
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:50.360]  gonna get the one with 128 eggs and the cellular for consumers you go big or you
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:56.720]  go Kindle I think that's what we've learned yeah well I think that the that
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.320]  the entry level one oddly enough is more for like a internal professional setting
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.880]  like like yeah I think sometimes people aren't like an Apple could do more they
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.560]  could absolutely identify like they used to do with the emac and identify those
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.680]  cues better but like 16 gigabyte iPhones and iPad twos and this entry-level iPad
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.240]  Pro there are people who are buying 2,000 of them for enterprise and all
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.640]  they want is business to business apps and web portals and they they will take
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:25.560]  it they'll take almost no storage well I think I think even for like an artistic
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.880]  purpose where you're doing really high-end work but at a place like if
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.720]  you've got like a studio and you're doing work on special effects on a movie
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.120]  or something like that and you want all of your artists to have this it makes
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.520]  sense to just buy the Wi-Fi low storage one because the storage isn't really
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.880]  gonna be on the iPad anyway it's gonna be on the server within your you know
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.000]  within your outfit you know I mean like there it's not like the artists on
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.800]  working on Star Wars are keeping all of the data on their local machine I mean
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.760]  it's yeah it's it's exactly the Scott McNealy or Larry Ellison thin client
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:02.320]  that's that's what we've gotten to finally yeah it's exactly that and so it
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.800]  makes sense to just get the the one without the you know it's not the end
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.780]  the end the studio these these artistic machines they're not leaving so they
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:15.280]  don't need cellular that's just you know wasted you know wasted money and wasted
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.800]  thickness if if if they're a little thicker like they were or just a wasted
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.000]  antenna and they don't need the storage if they're never gonna use the storage
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.600]  why in the world buy it why not just you know get the loan one so I think it is
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.760]  odd that there's no LTE skew for that because Apple's always had the same
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.880]  Wi-Fi and LTE skews for all of their iPads this is the first time where you
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.240]  have to get the more expensive one if you want LTE yeah that is interesting
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:41.480]  but I do think it's telling towards the intended use yes I think that if you
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.720]  want to use it as a laptop you know this is my portable now I shouldn't even say
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.360]  laptop because you know laptop word is loaded in terms of how you use it as
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:58.040]  your portable computer you know it's you're gonna want the the additional
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.760]  storage because 128 gigs of bytes of storage is not that much for a portable
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.440]  computer no and it's four gigabytes of RAM too so I mean it does have the
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.240]  constraints of a mobile device still right but it's you know that's the one
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.320]  that's specked out like a this is my portable computer and the 32 gig one is
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.880]  specked out like this is like an artist this is my studio computer right this is
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.800]  my drawing tablet did you get a chance to try the keyboard I spent only a few
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.000]  minutes with it but I like the Mac like I like low keyboards I like the MacBook
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.560]  keyboard a lot and I know you have very different tastes and keyboards yeah I
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.960]  don't like any laptop keyboard though like I don't even you know like I think
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.440]  that the MacBook Pro keyboard I have right now is probably my favorite
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:50.200]  laptop keyboard I've ever used and if not it's close and I still think it's
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.920]  kind of a crap keyboard compared to my you know big clacky yeah Apple extended
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.680]  keyboard too I make do I mean I write you know thousands of words a year on
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.160]  that MacBook Pro and if you could connect an IBM's electric you would well
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.400]  probably not an not in any of the areas where I would use the MacBook Pro I
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:09.800]  would only do that if I were using it as my only computer you know at my desk
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.020]  yes but then when I'm away so I mean I make do I mean I am picky about
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.680]  keyboards but I make do I don't find the new MacBook one again I haven't lived
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.200]  with that machine so I don't know but just playing around with it and the
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.240]  stores and stuff I mean I could definitely make do it doesn't seem that
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:33.720]  much worse than the 11 inch MacBook Air that I used as my portable for four
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:37.400]  years yeah I use it I took me an hour to get used to the only problem I have now
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.800]  is that it's still it goes right to the edge of the machines every time I pick
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.000]  it up I accidentally hit escape or enter or something I have to remember to
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.480]  pick it up from the bottom yeah and it does it having tried this thing at the
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.600]  event last week that the keyboard you know the travel is obviously very low
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:57.080]  but it travels enough that it's there absolutely is a clickiness to it which
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:03.720]  in and of itself is a huge win over and anything like that that I've tried
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.560]  before you know and I like that Apple had me Logitech announced the same day
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:10.800]  so Apple is letting anyone connect maybe not anyone but they're letting partners
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.760]  connect to those smart connectors and that means that there'll be a range of
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.840]  different keyboards available for it yeah I thought that that Logitech
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.340]  announcement was interesting and sort of another new Apple thing where they
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:26.520]  obviously you know looped loop to them in in advance and you know they haven't
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.640]  unveiled the details but they obviously looped them in and I think I think the
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.840]  thinking is that Apple decided this is what we want to build we want to build
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.200]  one keyboard it's gonna be a fold-up cover obviously with this port the
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.360]  potential is there for all sorts of other things including something that's
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.720]  more of like a leave it at your desk base station right so if you're just
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.040]  gonna use this and I think this is a very for a lot of people I think it's a
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:57.040]  really interesting scenario where this is your main computer and you take it
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.760]  around when you're at your desk why don't you when you want a keyboard
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.640]  that's even better as a key as a keyboard than the smart cover well
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.680]  there there's lots exactly what this Logitech seems like we don't know the
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.880]  details they've only shown one little carefully cropped photo of it but I mean
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.520]  that's what it seems like to me yeah I still have a drafting table that I've
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:22.440]  used since I was in high school and I was figuring you know could I put the
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:26.080]  iPad Pro on that and then tilt it down when I want to draw on it then tilt it
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.560]  up and just stick it in the keyboard when I want to I'm trying to figure out
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.880]  all the possible use cases it's almost like a lazy boy situation now where you
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:37.880]  can recline as much as you want yeah yeah exactly I wonder how much you can
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.920]  adjust the Logitech keyboard and obviously there's gonna be others other
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:44.120]  everybody else who makes these these sort of peripherals is going to make
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:53.600]  something for this and it is going to be a MFI port is MFI still made for iPhone
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.000]  or iPod originally but yeah like even the Apple watch stuff I think they're
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.120]  calling MFI songs at MFW right and which is really weird there because there's no
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:08.800]  I involved yeah it's gonna be MFI it's exactly you know licensed exactly along
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.040]  you know the same way that they license things like the lightning adapters so
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.540]  anybody who wants to is gonna be able to play along but I think that's really
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.080]  interesting and it really occurs to me people have been chasing the dream of
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.400]  the docked computer I mean as long as there have been portables I mean an
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.160]  apples had you know what were they called the duo's yeah the horrible duos
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:33.440]  with Doc's and there's pros and cons with all of them but the big thing
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.120]  whenever you try to do it is and you know even today there's maybe not
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.640]  there's there's no doc for a MacBook Pro but certainly you can and I know I know
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:50.920]  lots and lots of people who do live off one computer it's probably a MacBook Pro
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:55.480]  and it but when they get to their desk they have a nice big display to connect
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:03.880]  it to the the hassle of the docked lifestyle is in the tethering and
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:10.160]  untethering of all the various things you need to plug in power and USB and
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.440]  you know especially on the Mac the big annoying thing is if you have if you
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.040]  need to connect external storage well now you've got this thing that you can't
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:22.040]  just unplug you actually have to go in in software and unmounted and make sure
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:26.840]  that whatever software was using it is no longer using those open files and if
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:30.280]  you just want to get up and go it's a huge pain in the ass with the iPad Pro
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.120]  you're never gonna have to do anything but get up and go and you probably won't
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.880]  even need in most cases because of the battery life of things get you won't
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:43.680]  even need to plug in lightning to charge the iPad while you're using it you'll
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.800]  just charge the iPad overnight come in to the office and just put it right on
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.480]  your keyboard and then whenever you want to get up and go just just pick it up
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.680]  and it's super fascinating to me too because there are some companies who
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.160]  really think that they can that was a famous Microsoft saying right no
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.340]  compromises and it resulted in the biggest compromise ever because you
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.840]  literally cannot be all things to all people you can't serve every market
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.400]  equally well and Apple is being very they're taking interesting choices here
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.240]  like the MacBook is as close as you can get to being an iPad while still being a
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.680]  Mac and this is as close as you can get to being a MacBook almost while still
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.040]  being an iPad and they're not trying to do it all in one device they're giving
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:23.920]  you these devices that both have unique identities still but are optimized along
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:30.120]  the same sort of line and you just pick which side of it you want to be on yeah
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.800]  that's a good way to put it I mean but and and you know there's obviously
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.240]  compromises with all of it you know there's you know the compromises with
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.920]  the iPad Pro are obvious there is no external storage because there's no
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.160]  concept of it in iOS there is no USB port or USB C or anything that you can
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:51.080]  plug in an external drive it doesn't have built-in SD card you have to go you
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.360]  know with the lightning to SD card thing and it's not you know it works and
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.240]  people use it but it's not something you're gonna keep plugged in all the
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.400]  time you have to mostly want a tablet and then just occasionally want to use
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.280]  a keyboard with or you know just for a certain segment of things use a keyboard
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.720]  for it right so I'm interested what do you think they're gonna sell more of I
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.360]  off the top of your head you think they're gonna sell more smart keyboards
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:17.240]  or pencils I I'm just assuming maybe I'm biased because that's my background but
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.280]  I'm assuming the pencil because that really is a completely better take on
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.240]  that technology where we've had sort of keyboards on on iPads before and maybe
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.440]  Logitech will sell more than Apple even we don't know there's be hope they'll be
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.920]  fragmented across a variety of manufacturers but I think the pencil is
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.040]  gonna be unique to this device for a while yeah and I think that there's as
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:41.560]  kids grow older I know the ATP guys mentioned it last week but I've heard
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.840]  about it from Apple people for years is that the younger you are the less likely
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.560]  you are to really give a crap about on-screen keyboard versus physical
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.960]  keyboard of any kind whether it's built into the cover or whatever that you know
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:01.040]  kids who've grown up or are growing up in the iOS era see an on-screen touch
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.400]  keyboard as completely normal it's interesting because previously like you
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.120]  and I went through the migration from digital to become digitally native
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.640]  people weren't digitally native they were analog native they were reading
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.000]  newspapers and they became digitally native and now you have people who are
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.560]  touch native and using external and intermediated input devices it's just
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.280]  not the computing that they understand even when the MacBook launched and
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.720]  people were complaining they couldn't plug their external monitor into it the
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.040]  amount of people who plug an external monitor into a MacBook is tiny it's all
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.800]  of our friends on Twitter but it's it's single digit percentage points and it's
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.840]  just not normal behavior and that's I think increasingly driving Apple's
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.280]  products yeah I think so too anything else on iPad pro you want to talk about
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:46.040]  I mean I don't have a chance to try but the speakers were just they were
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:49.200]  marvelous you could just turn them and they had these big echo chambers for
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.040]  really loud speakers and when you rotate it from landscape to portrait or just in
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.920]  360 degrees it kept up with you yeah I it occurs to me that for all the
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:10.280]  bellyaching that's going on about the mono output of iOS devices that the way
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.880]  that they went stereo with this is like oh and going with four speakers that had
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:20.240]  never occurred to me before I maybe because I'm unimaginative but and that
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.200]  you know obviously just like the screen rotates the speakers rotate or at least
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.920]  you know the speakers don't physically rotate but the concept of which sound is
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:32.360]  coming from whichever they crossfade yeah right and knows what's up what's
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.800]  down what's left what's right no matter which way you're holding the device and
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.320]  boy in the demo area as noisy and crowded as it was boy it certainly
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:47.080]  seemed like something like hey that's something yeah it was really impressive
[01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.920]  and I just can't wait to actually get the device and put on like Avengers Age
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.520]  of Ultron or something full blast and and start rotating and see how well it
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:00.040]  does yeah it's kind of interesting and I wonder you know you know I don't know a
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:05.520]  lot of people watch a lot of video on iPads it's that's yes sizes obviously
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.960]  makes it better if you're willing to carry it around but boy the difference
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.440]  in sound output if you're not using headphones is dramatic now and this I
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:15.040]  mean before people used to joke that the I the iPad is a big iPhone I always
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:18.560]  thought it was more like an iPhone gone IMAX and this really is an iPad gone
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.360]  IMAX because when you're holding it close it fills your field of view and
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.120]  whether it's a game or a movie or something it really is immersive yeah
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:30.560]  totally agree the weight I think it's the last thing I'll just mention is I
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.720]  know that it sounds bad that it's a little like a three hundredths of a
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.440]  pound heavier than the original iPad because the original iPad sure feels
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.680]  heavy compared to modern iPads and there's certain scenarios where I guess
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  if you're walking around with it and and holding it in certain ways you're
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:55.160]  definitely gonna feel that but it's so much more balanced and it it it sure is
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:58.200]  hard to believe that it's as heavy as an original iPad when you pick it up and
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:02.240]  hold it because it's it's so much more distributed throughout the whole device
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.240]  yeah it's like the iPhone 6 Plus is equivalent to a smaller heavier iPhone
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:08.800]  but because it's so spread out you really don't feel that in normal use
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.720]  especially when you hold it near the middle yeah it definitely feels
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:19.680]  lightweight even though it's you know by iPad standards humongous all right let's
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.000]  move on let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor and another
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  longtime friend of the show love these guys igloo igloo is the intranet you'll
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.520]  actually like you I I say intranet and you work in enterprise or something and
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.280]  you just you're probably already like rolling your eyes you're sick because
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.520]  most intranets that are out there like SharePoint stuff like that look like
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:51.040]  they were designed in 1997 and in large part it's because they were in igloo is
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:29:00.440]  modern new intranet software hosted by them and it is modern in all the right
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:07.320]  ways everything they do is looks just as good and it looks like it was just as
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:14.520]  well designed for your phone as it was for your desktop your laptop or your you
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.760]  know your upcoming new iPad Pro really really good stuff lets you share what
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.920]  are the things you can do with igloo what is an intranet and for the modern
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:28.360]  day look like lets you share news organize files share files coordinate
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:33.880]  calendars manage projects set up little micro blogs which is sort of like having
[01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:38.600]  your own internal Twitter private just for your team just for your company all
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:43.120]  in one place their latest upgrade the one that they've been working on for
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:48.680]  2015 revolves around documents and how you interact with them gather feedback
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:55.480]  and make changes so they've added things like the ability to track who has read
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:58.920]  critical information to keep everyone on the same page it's more or less like
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:04.600]  read receipts in email except just for shared documents on the intranet and way
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:08.320]  less annoying and read receipts in email but if you've got a document that
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.840]  certain people on your team have to sign off on for some kind of compliance or
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:17.220]  just the way the rules of your teamwork you do that through igloo and you get
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:22.800]  that feedback right there in the igloo system itself really really great
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.060]  apparently really really high in demand from their customers so you know me my
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:30.800]  team is one person I but you know a lot of people out there have teams with more
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.520]  people signing off on these agreements and stuff like that and get into
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:39.660]  confirmation right in the igloo system big big hit this year if your company
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:44.920]  has a legacy internet some kind of crap or if you don't have any kind of
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.920]  intranet and you're just winging it without any kind of centralized
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:55.240]  organized internet to keep your team organized you really should give igloo a
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:01.320]  try and it's no lose giving it a try is the easiest thing in the world you can
[01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.040]  get a free trial at igloo software comm slash the talk show you don't really
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.480]  need the slash the talk show but it lets them know where you're coming from you
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:15.680]  got a free trial you get up to ten people on your team you can set up
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:19.080]  everything you want the whole thing just works you can see all the features see
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:22.040]  all the things I've been telling you about and for up to ten people it's just
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:25.800]  free and that's not just free for a limited time it's just free so if you
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.800]  work on a really small team if you've got under ten people you can just use
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:35.000]  igloo for free in perpetuity which is a deal you can't beat if you've got more
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.640]  than ten people try it with a small team first see how good it is and then check
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.080]  out their pricing on additional users it's super super competitive really
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.320]  really good it's about as low as you would think for something that's free
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.520]  for up to ten people in perpetuity really good pricing great features and
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.440]  and they're really innovating they're well innovating it sounds overwrought
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.660]  what they're doing is just building new features at a slow steady pace really
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:04.480]  really impressive they keep working on it it's not you know static software
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:07.460]  they're really working on it and it's great stuff so my thanks to igloo
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:13.680]  software at igloo software comm slash the talk show what was the next thing
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:18.400]  they announced Apple TV yeah I don't want to spend too much time on it yet
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:22.760]  because we just don't know that much but my first impressions are that it's
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.200]  exactly what I wanted and I even bitched last week on the show that the main
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.760]  thing I really wanted it was is something Syracuse has been talking
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:36.400]  about for years too is to get fast forward and reverse scrubbing get the
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:40.980]  latency on that and the user experience of that modernize that do what you know
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:45.680]  that a computer can do which is you know give it a good feel and give it a sense
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:49.360]  that you know where the hell you're going and where you're gonna stop and at
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.740]  least on the demo I know in the onstage demonstrations that look great in the
[01:32:53.740 --> 01:33:00.400]  hands-on area it worked as advertised in my hands it was really good and
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.440]  especially if you've ever used the the iPhone remote app will you slide and it
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:08.760]  goes too far it doesn't go far oh it doesn't solve that iPhone remote app
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:12.260]  doesn't solve the problem at all yeah in fact it never never does I never works
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.600]  the way I wanted to it's this was phenomenal just exactly where I wanted
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.760]  it to be now whether it'll work like that for all content from all sources I
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:26.300]  don't know because I have found with the current Apple TV that some are worse
[01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:32.280]  than others you know and iTunes movies which you know you don't really stream
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:37.440]  which is kind of download in a chunk work better so who knows how the
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.600]  streaming will work but I you know I know that there were people from the
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.960]  streaming in particular was something that they wanted to get better too so
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.560]  we'll see how it works in the real world and we'll see what kind of partnership
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.800]  they get with the companies like Netflix and HBO and and we're seeing more
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.440]  partnerships to like HBO famously switched to the MLB team streaming for
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:00.000]  there and and those companies are gonna get better and better at it well and I
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  think that they have every interest in working with Apple on getting their
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.760]  experience on this thing as good as possible and talking to people from the
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:11.480]  Apple TV team last week there's no doubt in my mind that they they take that
[01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:15.000]  seriously like there as a you know they're exactly like I was hoping that
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.880]  they were they really really they were completely dissatisfied with the fast
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:25.960]  forward and reverse experience on the old Apple TV and didn't want to just
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:30.840]  make it a little better wanted to really kind of bring it to the the modern day
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.400]  really just take a great leap forward in that and I couldn't be more excited
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.480]  about that and I know this is nerdy but what I really like is that for a while
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.200]  now at least on the Apple TV iPhone and iPad we've been running iOS under the
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.400]  covers and just across the platform and now the watch is that too they all run
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.200]  iOS and they all have you know backboard and frontboard as the platform for those
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.840]  technologies and then the iPhone and iPad has springboard the watch has
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:57.720]  carousel and Apple TV has I forget it's a pine board and headboard or something
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:01.080]  but they're all they're all the same thing they are all running the same
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.520]  platform you can as a user I I don't know the details of the watch compared
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.680]  to the TV compared to the iPhone but I can figure it out because they are very
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:12.560]  similar things and for developers yes Apple is doing things like they're
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.880]  making WebKit and and the web basically a private API for the watch and the
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.240]  Apple TV and that does have consequences but essentially if you know how to make
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.520]  apps for one of them you can make apps for all of them making a watch extension
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:26.240]  or making an Apple TV app is not something foreign to you it's not a
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.600]  whole new platform you have to learn and all the technologies that Apple's been
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:34.640]  doing like we talked about for iOS 7 and iOS 8 and now an iOS 9 those are
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.600]  leveraged across all of these devices and it's one of those things where
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.880]  everything Apple does for one of them ends up making all of them better again
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:53.800]  I totally agree right there's there's a lot of reuse yeah and it everything is
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.680]  not as siloed as it was in the old days no they have teams working like the
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.280]  messages team on the watch knows like our part and parcel with the messages
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:06.320]  team maybe not the exact people but there's they're not segregated anymore
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:11.440]  and on-demand resources I mean that's interesting at WWDC when they talk
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.800]  about it as part of app thinning but then you see an Apple TV and they don't
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.800]  want and I know there was some concern about this but they don't want you to
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.000]  have a 32 gigabyte Apple TV and you go to download an app and it says your
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.120]  Apple TV is full you have to delete something and you got to go and try and
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.200]  figure out they don't want you to be anywhere near that experience so there
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.320]  if your Apple TV is empty they'll download a 200 megabyte initial file and
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.880]  then immediately start downloading a 2 gigabyte tag and then immediately start
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.840]  downloading more and as much as they can but if your Apple TV is almost full
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.320]  they'll download that first really small file which will almost assuredly fit and
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.440]  then start removing the less frequently used and older data so they can make
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.560]  room for the new frequently used data and they're doing this whole nearline
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.840]  management system that makes these devices hopefully I guess the goal is to
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.800]  make that all seamless for the end user and yes it's absolutely more work for a
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.120]  developer has to go through and make these resource slices and tag them and
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:04.840]  do everything but the result is you know you're sitting there and you want to
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:08.600]  play Minecraft you don't get that pop-up saying sorry can't install it yeah
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:15.080]  absolutely yeah I think you know and and Serenity Caldwell tackled it very ably
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.280]  in a piece I don't know if it came out yesterday at least yesterday was when I
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:27.640]  saw it but you know that it quickly got misinterpreted as apps for Apple TV have
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:34.920]  a 200 megabyte limit and knowing that you know there's an awful lot of games
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.600]  that that's not enough for that's not the case it's just a 200 megabyte
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:44.600]  initial download just to have an app that's on your Apple TV that you can
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.880]  launch 200 megabyte limit and then after that whatever other resources you need
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.480]  and let's face it we're mostly talking about games you can start downloading
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:56.880]  immediately and it could be anything it can be levels it could be texture maps
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.720]  it could be like you've seen the the introductory tutorial video you don't
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.840]  need that anymore it throws it away you don't need these cutscenes anymore you
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:07.320]  don't need these costume packs or you don't need this expansion pack it just
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.960]  throws those away I mean guy did I forget what we could guy did a really
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:13.160]  good explanation of this too and I understand like this is not if you just
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:18.120]  use unity or you just use epics engine maybe this is could be even be
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.960]  impossible I don't know but it might be very difficult to slice your app this
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:25.160]  way but they're they're they're solving for me sitting on my couch on a small
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:34.080]  capacity device yeah so I'm impressed by the video latency I am delighted at this
[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:40.400]  prospect of apps and games for the thing I think I like the controller I don't
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:45.480]  know that it's gonna be a great controller for games I think how much
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.280]  gaming actually takes place on this thing I really don't know about but I
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:56.720]  think in terms of using it to watch TV it is it has the potential to truly be
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.020]  what we've always hoped Apple TV would be I agree and you can only right now
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.280]  you can only have one of them attached and unfortunately it's the remote you're
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.680]  talking about yeah you can only have one of the Apple remotes attached if you
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.840]  want to have other things you have to use iOS devices probably running an
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:12.320]  updated version of the Apple remote app or you have to use the made for iPhone
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:15.800]  and which is now in the misnomer the made for iPhone game controllers and
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.700]  recently it looks like there was a change in policy that says you have to
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.760]  at least include controls for the Apple remote you can't make a game that's
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.720]  that's my controller only yeah and that's led to some consternation too
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.160]  because the Apple remote doesn't have the physical capabilities of a full game
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:37.480]  pad right like there's no way to simulate a d-pad and an analog stick and
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.640]  a trigger but yeah and all those things and shoulder buttons etc etc so yeah
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:50.600]  that's obviously going to limit it's obviously going to limit some of the
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.360]  games that can come out but my hope is that because they again this causes a
[01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:58.200]  lot of angst on Twitter but the best thing you can do is file a radar write
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.480]  an article explaining like if you just write an article Apple hates gamers and
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:04.320]  that doesn't really get anyone's attention it's easy to dismiss that but
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.880]  write a really informed article about this is what the game you want to make
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.600]  why it's awesome and why how Apple is stopping you and these debates go on
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.200]  inside like we all hear them they go on inside the company too there are people
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:16.880]  fighting for both sides of this all the time and if you have a stake in one side
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.440]  or another just arm them as best you can yeah I have heard though and I know we
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.040]  talked about it offline but that you you know that the buttons on the remote are
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.120]  programmable you know by the app so you can use the buttons for game buttons but
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.160]  you're still you know you're obviously limited in some way by the fact that
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.920]  it's just a you've got the accelerometer so you can do like the paddle game type
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:46.480]  stuff that they showed on stage and you know whatever else you can do with that
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:52.800]  wiimote style waving the thing at the screen and you have a touchpad but
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.200]  clearly that's no substitute for a d-pad yeah I mean it's just these things are
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.960]  always attention and whether it's gonna like what do you need to control a great
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.420]  entertainment center and what do you need to control a great video game and I
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:07.900]  remember using my Xbox media center with the Xbox controller and that wasn't
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:11.000]  great I had to go and buy the hardware controller but that wasn't the sort of
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.520]  stupid for games so like you end up with these environments I also saw some
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.480]  confusion a lot of people seem confused that when you look at like the user
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.240]  interface guidelines that they have the difference they have something things
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:30.280]  that involve a click and things that involve a tap and I think it's funny I
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.680]  didn't see any confusion over this until after I'd had my hands on period with
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:44.520]  them I think that I think that what it is is that the touchpad clicks when you
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:50.760]  press it but you can also just tap it without clicking sort of like a Mac book
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.920]  trackpad yeah I couldn't get a clear answer about that and I and you there
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:59.720]  was so much going on then I neglected to follow up properly but I heard both that
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:04.880]  you couldn't couldn't tap on it yeah I well I think you can tap and you can
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:08.760]  click and the click is actual a physical click and the tap is just like tapping
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:12.360]  so it's effectively like the way that a MacBook can have taps that don't
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.080]  actually click it and a click which is a click so like the magic trackpad if you
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.720]  have it set up that way yeah I think we're gonna need more than you know two
[01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:25.520]  minutes of hands-on area demo time with it to really figure it out and the series
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.320]  stuff it was way better than I thought it because you know Syria has often been
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.680]  our point of concern for some people but I tried all that stuff and just the
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  ability to say what did he say and it goes back you know 30 seconds or
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.600]  something and gives you the subtitles at the same time that's such a great
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:43.640]  feature it really is and part of it comes to the the whole like being better
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:50.000]  at scrubbing and keeping keeping more of that stream to video you know alive and
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.400]  memory so that you can do that but then turning on the captions for that it's
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.480]  such a great accessibility feature and it's one of those accessibility features
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:04.560]  that is like it just shows that accessibility is for can be for anybody
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.680]  like you couldn't have you know absolutely nothing that you you know
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:14.200]  perfect vision great hearing you know no motor skill problems at all but a
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:18.560]  feature like that like if you just can't make out what a character said that's
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:22.640]  accessibility right that just shows how accessibility don't think of
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:26.080]  accessibility as being for others for people who have some sort of
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:30.560]  disabilities or something like that it it it really you know it certainly is
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:36.880]  more important for people who have disabilities but to me that's a great
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.800]  example of how you accessibility is a mindset and it really works for
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.400]  everybody and it is amazing because one of the first things that will happen
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.920]  when I go to any event I imagine it's somewhere for you is I get a bunch of
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.320]  people saying please ask them before I silver is still there because
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.920]  accessibility accessibility community is incredibly passionate incredibly engaged
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:54.760]  but they always feel like they don't really make Apple any money or
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.000]  companies in general and they'll be the first thing that gets chopped if any
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.520]  deadlines get right right so they're always they're always really really
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.480]  concerned that there's not going to be there well and then they've seen it with
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:09.280]  other products yeah absolutely but you know day one Apple had voiceover for the
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:13.960]  Apple TV they had voiceover for 3d touch on the iPhone and I asked them about
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.080]  that and they said you know that it's not even a point of pride for them it's
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.480]  just they believe that it's something that has to be done and they have teams
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.400]  of people making sure it gets done tell me what I don't know anything about
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:27.760]  voiceover for 3d touch so right now if you press the the 3d touch on it and you
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.960]  have voiceover enabled it'll tell you what it is and then when it pops up you
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:33.840]  can flick through and it'll read out to you the different option choices for
[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:37.080]  example on a home screen icon and then you can choose the one that you want and
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:40.840]  that makes it accessible to people who can't see the actual 3d touch controls
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:46.520]  gotcha yeah that makes sense yeah I'm not surprised but that's really great
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:54.880]  and you know the Siri responsiveness in the hands-on demo area was as as good as
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:00.120]  shown on stage I mean I was completely uncreative and just did the same thing
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:04.280]  they did I mean perhaps it wasn't a good test but I did the you know show me some
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.080]  James Bond movies I did show me episodes the talk show where molt is a guest and
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:16.440]  got like 300 results it's pretty good that's a pretty good one but I saw other
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.760]  people doing other ones you know I forget what other ones you know show me
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.840]  action movies only the new ones and and stuff like that worked and I you know
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:34.520]  okay it's you know it's not gonna make a truly magical upgrade year-over-year
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:40.540]  Siri isn't gonna suddenly become how from 2001 but it it does seem like it's
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:44.740]  getting better and it does seem like the Apple TV team in particular has somehow
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:51.080]  figured out a way to get it even better than the other platforms were series
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.520]  available well my understanding I might be wrong is that the Siri team was still
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.080]  doing like a lot of this work and it was delivered to the Apple TV team but just
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.260]  in general that team because Siri is one of those things where the first time you
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:05.740]  try it it seems magical but when you do have problems you're just off forget it
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:08.080]  I'm not using it again and they have to be really careful because they don't
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.000]  have that many shots to make it a permanent part of your workflow but with
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.920]  this Siri does this thing called if you aren't familiar with it sequential
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.240]  inference where when you say something and then you say something else it bases
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:22.120]  its answer not on the the thing you most recently said but on the context of the
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.000]  history going back to when you first started talking to it and they were
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.820]  doing that like you know like show me James Bond movies only show me the new
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:31.720]  ones only show me the ones with Sean Connery only show me the ones with you
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:35.280]  know this or this or that guest art and and they they it could keep up with the
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.040]  context and it could both reduce the amount of options and increase them in a
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.680]  way that really seemed like you were talking to somebody and that to me was
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.840]  the most impressive impressive thing just the way it could do such fast set
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:52.000]  sorting and give you a result that was what you wanted yeah another thing again
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:47:00.400]  something that's not you know go back seven seconds is a feature and never
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.840]  occurred to me because it just seemed too good to be true now that I've seen
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.760]  it I can't wait to have it some of the features though that they have are
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:10.520]  things that we've all wanted since forever like Universal Search where if
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.280]  you know you want to see Caddyshack you say show me Caddyshack and you have a
[01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:19.720]  Netflix subscription and you maybe have HBO show me if that if Caddyshack is
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:23.040]  available for me so I don't even have to pay anything to get it because it's
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.560]  already on Netflix and show it in one place don't make me go into Netflix and
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:32.920]  search there then go to HBO then go to iTunes there it is now they've done it
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.560]  this is one of those things where it really does suck to be Apple it's almost
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.280]  like because people have been asking for this for years and Apple wanted to do it
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.760]  for years and the the media companies would not let them they did not want to
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:47.160]  be reduced to one of many options on a TV set and it's almost like when they
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.880]  gave Amazon NPR DRM free music and wouldn't give it to Apple once in a
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.200]  while you know Apple does Apple not only does not get what they want but gets the
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.120]  opposite of what they want and I don't know how they ended up getting this deal
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.760]  but when you see it and you start asking for those things and it just works and I
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.480]  think you know that the media companies can't be completely happy about that
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.400]  because it does reduce them to a commodity and they can't be happy about
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.020]  skipping around and all these things but Apple was able to do it and to me that
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.560]  makes just for a much better experience yeah but I think that in some ways maybe
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:19.880]  they maybe they sold it to them on the merits of the user experience which is
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:25.440]  and especially like if you're a Netflix subscriber if you're not you're not
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  gonna get those results anyway because you don't have Netflix if you are a
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:33.440]  Netflix subscriber and you want to see a certain movie why wouldn't you if you
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.280]  if I you know the results from Siri say okay you can get it from iTunes and
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.440]  it'll be a dollar 99 rental or 99 cent rental or 399 rental or you can just hit
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:47.200]  play on Netflix why wouldn't you just hit play on Netflix and I believe
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.920]  they're doing it with part like not everyone has access to the search on
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.840]  Apple TV I think use that still partner program based right and it's definitely
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:02.000]  partner place partner based and so like for example if and when Amazon submits
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.640]  an Amazon Prime video app to the App Store just because they've submitted the
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.240]  app the content of it won't necessarily won't just show up magically those those
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:17.040]  universal results are limited to partners but I really can't see in the
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.720]  modern world where they wouldn't want to partner with that and how many other
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.000]  places are there where you could see it if it's the same movie or TV show you
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.560]  know how how likely is it be gonna be because like HBO usually has like a
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:36.880]  rotation like this month these are the movies HBO has and so sure maybe
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:41.720]  sometime there's gonna be a movie that's available on both Netflix and HBO and so
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:45.520]  you the person who just did the query are gonna pick one and you wouldn't pick
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.520]  the other but who's to say you wouldn't have searched in the one you picked
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.400]  first anyway right in which case you still wouldn't be giving them the play
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.880]  and ultimately what Netflix really wants is you to just remain a subscriber I
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.640]  mean whether you watch you know Smokey and the Bandit on HBO instead of
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:06.280]  watching it on Netflix doesn't cost them any money if you're still paying your
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.760]  monthly bill and lastly I think they all seem to know that the future for these
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:19.440]  services is their exclusive stuff what's made HBO HBO is HBO exclusive shows like
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:23.840]  Game of Thrones and True Detective and what's what's keeping Netflix relevant
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.800]  what's keeping what's making red Netflix more popular than ever it's the Netflix
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.200]  original content and when you search for that original content wouldn't you why
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:38.280]  wouldn't you want it to show up if you just ask Siri you know show me you know
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:42.040]  what's the Kevin Spacey one House of Cards House of Cards show me House of
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.100]  Cards why wouldn't you want that to show up as just universal search wherever you
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:49.120]  are I think the fact that they know that the stuff that's most important for you
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:52.720]  to find from them is their exclusive stuff which you're not you can't find
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:57.480]  anywhere else it changes the dynamics of why they would want to be involved in
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:01.720]  that yeah the entire thing is changing sometimes it's frustratingly slow but I
[01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:05.000]  think absolutely at a certain point they're gonna be exclusive data and
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.720]  that's more important than being an exclusive interface yeah and I think if
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:11.080]  there's anybody who maybe wouldn't want to be involved in it for a nickel and
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:16.840]  diming from a nickel and diming angle it would be Apple in terms of if your
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.840]  option would be to rent it from Apple and this is right now speaking before
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:24.000]  any sort of hypothetical streaming package that they might offer in the
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.200]  future but as of today as of when we first get our first Apple new Apple TVs
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:34.080]  later later this year if there's a movie that they have for rent but Netflix has
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:39.200]  it or HBO has it and you're a Netflix and HBO subscriber it's gonna cost Apple
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:42.180]  money because you're not gonna rent it you're gonna go watch the copy of it you
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.560]  can see for free well to your point though I mean they're their biggest deal
[01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:49.040]  now is the early access things where you can get for example Age of Ultron or
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:52.720]  something else weeks before any other service and yes it's full price but if
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:56.000]  you want it badly enough you can have it well and ultimately I think it just gets
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.760]  to the usual Apple mantra of that that for you know let's just make it awesome
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.120]  let's make an awesome experience and we'll worry about you know we'll get our
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:06.840]  money eventually but we don't have to make every single three dollars that we
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:10.960]  have you know at a time that we that we theoretically could get if people are
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:15.480]  gonna be happy using Netflix on Apple TV good yeah they would absolutely rather
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.080]  you have an Apple TV than you may worry about who you're gonna rent something
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:25.880]  from yeah so we still haven't even talked about the iPhones I know it's such
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:36.600]  a long show with so much to cover iPhone 6s yes I heard there's anything
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:42.240]  anything surprising no I liked Apple's tagline because every year they get
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.440]  shit free all it's exactly the same as the last one which is the same with a
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:48.840]  9-eleven every Nokia phone is like the same for years every HTC phone every
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.240]  Samsung I mean they're phones and this year they sort of turned that around
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:54.880]  where they said nothing has changed except for everything and I thought that
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:58.560]  was a good wink and nod to that meme and I really like that commercial the way
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:04.480]  that the commercial just takes that reaction square on and even starts with
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.560]  it even really starts and with the narrator Lake Bell really isn't she's
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.160]  not she doesn't sound sarcastic she really sounds like she's going with the
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:16.840]  idea that there's not much of that's new and then starts telling you everything
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:24.520]  that's new and ultimately I don't know my my take is that if anything if you if
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:28.320]  you're on a two-year up upgrade cycle if you get a new iPhone every two years
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.320]  which is totally sensible it's a lot more sensible than the get one everyone
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:36.680]  by everyone that comes out upgrade cycle that I'm on I mean you know likewise I
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:41.120]  think it's totally sensible I think in general you're better off on the s
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:48.080]  cycle yes I think that the s upgrades are often the ones that have the more
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:51.440]  stuff I think it was the 5s that invented touch that not invented but
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.940]  brought touch ID to us yeah 4s was Siri 3s was the new chipset in video
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:01.640]  recording yeah and some of the performance upgrades really seem most
[01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:06.000]  noticeable and that goes back to the original asked the 3GS the 3GS was a
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.160]  huge upgrade maybe in hindsight and it's hard to rate these things because it's
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:16.440]  it's largely an iterative process and it's been so close to annual that you
[01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:22.920]  really we've been hearing these complaints ever since the 3G I mean
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.760]  honestly the first sec you know the second iPhone ever made well it's now
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:33.880]  it's plastic and all they did was add 3G and every single year since then the
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:36.520]  some of the same people have been complaining that this is not a major
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:43.280]  upgrade and yet here we are you know eight years later and and we have this
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:46.680]  phone instead of the original iPhone and it's it's you know it's almost
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.800]  incomprehensible how much better it is I mean every year is like that is
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:55.240]  incremental in some ways but I think in general some of the more impressive
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:55:01.680]  engineering stuff comes on the s year cycles when they can work within the
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:06.320]  design constraints of the previous year yeah it seems oftentimes and I guess it
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.560]  depends on what department you're in that your chief challenge in the design
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:13.080]  years is to get all your stuff to fit in a new design whether it's a camera or a
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.440]  processor they thinner he's got but you know more thermal constraint and you've
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.360]  got to figure all that out and then you figure that out already you've paid that
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.200]  tax in the next year you can just start racing ahead again right that the you
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:26.520]  know that I think like that six obviously was about making it bigger and
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.840]  that certainly is some engineering involved but all of the technologies
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:34.360]  were the same as the technologies that were there before and it's the s year
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:41.560]  model that comes with 3d touch yeah and it's and you always wonder what story
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:44.820]  like to me and I think we've talked about this before to me what Apple is
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:47.560]  gonna do is never that interesting it's the same reason like I don't want to
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.600]  know what's gonna happen in the new Star Wars movie I want to see how well
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:54.080]  they're gonna realize it if you just look at Phantom Menace on paper you
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.560]  know you there's this character that character that tells you what's gonna
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:00.440]  happen but it doesn't tell you what the movie is gonna be and I want to see how
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.080]  Apple presents this stuff like you hear about you know they use for such in the
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.720]  watch they use it in the trackpad they're gonna use it in the phone but
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.640]  how are they gonna use it and what difference is it gonna make in me using
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.160]  the phone that's always a super interesting part and I dated way better
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.160]  with that than I thought they were gonna do they just made a really a really
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:23.760]  well-crafted story around 3d touch for me I I think it's interesting that
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:32.040]  they've settled on this two years cycle of industrial design and it's been other
[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:37.280]  than the original iPhone it has been I mean there's been no exceptions
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.360]  whatsoever right so there's the original iPhone which was like a one-off then
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:47.600]  there was the 3g then the 3gs which is exactly from the outside you know like
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:52.160]  the 3g but you know with better internals then the 4 and then the 4s
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:57:00.480]  then the 5 then 5s 6 6s I you know again you you know like I proved you know last
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.800]  week you can definitely go wrong by expecting that Apple will keep doing in
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.680]  the future what it's done in the past but for some reason I feel like it
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.200]  really works for them here and that they've got this down and that it gives
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:16.480]  the industrial design team two years to come out with what's next and they're
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:23.600]  not scrambling every year and I think it it gives use you know gives every the
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:30.460]  ecosystem an extra year of like case compatibility I know that there was some
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:33.760]  talk or speculation I haven't even looked at the specs I honestly don't
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.720]  even know but that that the 6 X's are slightly like in terms of tenths of a
[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:45.160]  millimeter thicker or something but I asked and they are case compatible like
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:50.680]  any case that was certified for your iPhone 6 yeah should fit on a 6s it's
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:54.400]  like a super cheap case with no manufacturing tolerances at all but that
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:59.640]  yeah so there might be exceptions but I think the ones I think like I don't know
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:03.040]  I to my knowledge if there are exceptions it would have to be something
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:08.380]  that is you know some kind of totally rigid thing I don't know yeah no they're
[01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:12.000]  compatible within tolerance levels are completely compatible and that's such a
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.680]  big deal for some of the things that like ecosystem wise are such a big
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:20.360]  advantage of being an iPhone user like when you go to Disney World and if you
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:26.600]  want to buy a you want to buy a case from Disney for your iPhone the fact
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.440]  that they're all the ones they already have are gonna fit the fun like if you
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:34.160]  buy a new phone you know now in September you can just go there and all
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.400]  those cases that are running stars already work it's a huge advantage yeah
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.880]  and the manufacturer will tell you exactly the same thing that they don't
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:44.000]  have to cut new cases every year and also they don't have to try and cover
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.720]  nine or ten different designs from the same company every year right yeah I
[01:58:47.720 --> 01:58:51.440]  totally think so and you know and for example so like for the the engineering
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:54.560]  team working on 3d touch and who knows how many years they've been working on
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:59.480]  this you know a lot apparently probably a lot but they you know as soon as the
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:06.560]  hardware designed for the 6 and 6s was set a whole bunch of the constraint that
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:10.480]  they would have to know to worry about we're set yeah and you know yes they
[01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:14.360]  made a change and they switched from whatever series aluminum to 7,000 series
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:18.240]  aluminum and I'm sure there were all sorts of little things along the way
[01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:22.080]  where they got you know monkey wrenches thrown in the works but at a basic level
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:25.920]  they knew the sizes of the devices that they would be working with they knew the
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:31.680]  sizes of the displays and I you know I and that's not like they knew that last
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:35.040]  year that's like they knew that two years ago because the design of the six
[01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:40.800]  and six at six plus was set two years ago a year in advance you know somewhere
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:43.920]  within Apple there's a team that knows exactly what the iPhone 7 is going to
[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.520]  look like next year yeah if not further ahead yeah it might have been set might
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:51.080]  have been said months ago because that's how far in advance some of this stuff
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:57.940]  has to go it's you know but I can only assume that that's you know the schedule
[01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:01.160]  that they're on but I don't think there's any advance I just think it as
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:04.360]  the years go on it I've always thought this but I think as the years go on you
[02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:08.800]  look more and more superficial if you really are gonna judge whether the
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:13.000]  iPhone is an improvement year-over-year just by whether the exterior design
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.160]  looks new yeah I want to tweet that every year just make a general reminder
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.840]  to people that you know we know who are reviewing these things that you know
[02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.040]  human beings aren't buying them every year for a lot of people they're
[02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.960]  upgrading from a 4s a 5 a 5c a 5s and it's a it's a substantial upgrade and
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:29.840]  the really the really funny thing is that Apple can do all this and people
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:33.060]  will say oh it's boring it's not a big upgrade and then they'll make it like
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:36.600]  gold or rose gold and so they're flying off the shelves because it turns out you
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.480]  scratch our surface and what you find more surface yeah well speaking of that
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:47.160]  before we move on what did you think of the new rose gold anodized aluminum
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:51.520]  that's what I ordered did you really yeah Wow I try to get the new color
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.760]  because it I photographed these things a lot and it is a very monotonous page
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:58.400]  when everything is the same color so I always try to get whatever new is
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:01.600]  available that livens things up but I was interested I wasn't sure if it was
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.880]  gonna be because usually rose gold is much more coppery than this and this is
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:09.960]  really much more rose than it is gold hmm and the watch matches and it I mean
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:14.240]  it's it's different it's a very different direction for Apple that was
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:18.240]  one of the things I was interested in is I know that the the watch started them
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:24.040]  with the 7000 series aluminum and now the phone is on it and talking to them
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.240]  and it's one of those questions where they're not gonna quite give you a
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.320]  complete answer but you know like a wink-wink judge answer is it the same
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:35.040]  aluminum and it's like yeah it's the same aluminum it's you know and it's the
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.640]  same metallurgy teams working hand-in-hand and so looking at I was
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.940]  looking at the watch that the rose gold watch at the event last week and it's
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:47.480]  under that like I said this really nice lighting like really nice I mean you
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.760]  just cannot believe it's not sunlight lighting like nice and diffuse and
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:58.320]  seemingly a very very you know neutral color and the guy from Apple at the desk
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:00.720]  I was where they say would you know what do you have a question I was like I'm
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.740]  just curious how well it matches the the phone you know the rose gold phone but
[02:02:04.740 --> 02:02:07.800]  the phones were at another table and you can't just walk around with these things
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:10.920]  and he goes oh you want to see it and like they had they were ready for that
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:13.640]  and they're you know he had a little key and he could unlock a drawer right there
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.160]  and even at the watch table he could take out a rose gold phone and put it
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.680]  side by side for me and I mean I got really close I got as close as I could
[02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:27.400]  and I mean those things are identical I mean it's far beyond the capabilities of
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:32.320]  my vision to notice any difference in the color yeah I got a photo I asked
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.760]  them if they could hold it up for me I got a photo of them together and they
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.680]  were it's hard to see from the picture but they were so so very similar but
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.880]  there's a almost a running joke that the the space grays have not always matched
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.260]  like they've changed over the years because black is the hardest color to
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:49.560]  anodize and if you try to make it really black it chips and it flakes so you go
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.880]  down to gray and then maybe you get a little bit better at it and like with
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:54.880]  the watch they could make it darker again does that hold up on a phone so
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:58.000]  that's that's always a moving target but I'm understanding as gold is the
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.120]  easiest color and some of these variations are much easier to just nail
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:09.320]  time after time yeah and I when I was in the I mean this is the worst type of
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:13.760]  evidence it's an anecdote of one but I what what happened was I think it was
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:18.160]  was it yesterday or Monday well one of the last two days I was walking my son
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:23.920]  home from school and I know he's really interested in the product red strap
[02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:29.800]  sports strap and so I said well let's you know swing by the Apple store on the
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.400]  way home it's a beautiful day let's walk by and go in and look and we went and
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.520]  looked and you know not for sale yet but they were there on demonstrate and while
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:42.360]  we were there guy came in and he wanted to see the rose gold watch and it you
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:46.840]  know so anecdote of one they said the new color seemed popular yeah I mean
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:50.280]  that's just it because we do respond we respond to some form of
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:53.520]  individualization when everybody has the same color watch you start to feel like
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.920]  if you get something different it's just a little bit more your own yeah and I
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:04.880]  you know again I don't I think it's interesting that it's I I think that the
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:11.400]  silver silver back and white face watch and I think you know is is truly I think
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.640]  all of them are doing my point is I think they're all relatively gender
[02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:19.680]  neutral colors I think that the rose gold is gonna skew a little bit more
[02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:24.560]  towards women and I think space black probably and watch phone all devices
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:29.480]  probably skews a little bit more towards men but even at those extremes I don't
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:34.600]  think it's I don't think it's that far from 5050 you know and if you talk to
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.640]  any I've talked to all the manufacturers over the years and they will always tell
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:41.520]  you that black is by far the biggest seller because it is cliched as it
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:44.280]  sounds it is a little black shirt a little black dress it's the one thing
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:47.520]  that you get that goes with everything and people just tend to go that way
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.160]  because you know you want to dress it up or you want to do something else so you
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.680]  don't people to notice it and the flashy colors they get a lot of attention but
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:59.760]  they're never high sellers yeah I think I think that maybe if there's if there's
[02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:03.800]  a sport band that may be skewed specifically towards women it's the rose
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:10.080]  gold with the I think they're calling a lavender yeah this is is probably you
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:14.320]  know pretty feminine but I guess the way I would put it is even the ones that
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:19.280]  skew a little feminine don't skew girly none of them look and you know I mean
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.960]  like in terms of linguistics that there's a difference to me between
[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:25.840]  what's feminine and what's girly and the stuff doesn't look girly it looks
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.560]  feminine no the entire park line like it's not childish in any way that
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:33.360]  everything from the blue like nothing is boyish either everything is sort of it's
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:39.200]  not like it's not a gold gold phone it's not a hot pink phone everything has sort
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:46.520]  of this layer of not conserved isn't our way but just a restraint on it I think
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:49.320]  what else I guess the only other thing I can think of right off the top of my
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.160]  head to cover with the iPhone 6 and success and success plus would be the
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:57.040]  live pictures feature that and I was really impressed with the camera that
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:06:00.600]  was a big question to me yeah well and and you know I guess they're semi
[02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:06.040]  related it's you know there were a lot of arguments last weekend at XOXO about
[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:11.200]  whether live pictures are are a new thing or whether they're they're just
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:16.280]  videos just phones have been doing like I just have this ongoing joke that Nokia
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:19.960]  invented everything in 1812 is there been live pictures on Windows Phone and
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:23.920]  there's been live pictures on HTC phones before but whoever inventing it first
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:27.000]  it's like who's being first in a comment section on the internet first first is
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:32.760]  who makes us successful that really matters it reminds me of the photos in
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:39.960]  the Daily Prophet in the Harry Potter world it's it you know I don't know
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.400]  they're still those were visually impressive when you saw the movies oh
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:46.320]  definitely they're also visually impressive at Universal Studios when you
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:48.960]  look at that when you go through the rides down there and I don't know what
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:51.960]  you heard but when I was talking to Apple they were very careful not to call
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.920]  them videos but to say that these are still photos being taken in quick
[02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:57.280]  succession and then animated like they didn't want to make it sound like they
[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:01.160]  were just doing a quick video wasn't some wasn't even so much that they
[02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.760]  wouldn't say that their videos is that if you called them videos they would
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:07.520]  they would say no they're not videos these are live photos and you know
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:16.240]  videos are videos and these are live photos these are 12 megapixels yeah but
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:19.000]  yeah I think the camera is impressive too but that's the sort of thing that's
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.640]  really hard to tell from their demos and and you certainly can't take any
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:26.400]  pictures in the hands-on area that that prove anything but the interesting thing
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:30.040]  to me was that when you generally a lot of times when you take a camera and you
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:33.880]  add megapixels a lazy company will just cut up the sensor into smaller and
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:37.180]  smaller bits and then you get less and less light you know those pixels and you
[02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:40.560]  get shittier pictures they just they they are noisy and there's not a lot of
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:44.160]  fine-grain detail and yes you can still crop them and digitally zoom them but
[02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:48.160]  you're dealing with bad data and Apple went to a lot of like they did not the
[02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:51.100]  iPhone camera has always been about making really really smart compromises
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:54.680]  on aperture and sensor size and all these things and I was happy they kept
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:57.920]  doing it they didn't just capitulate and say we'll make it we'll put an 18
[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:02.240]  megapixel or 30 megapixel lens on here they made they went to 12 but they did
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:05.240]  you know and Phil Schiller kind of made fun of himself but they did do the deep
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:09.960]  trench isolation which if only the Death Star had with Empire still be in
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:14.960]  business but it's a good joke but they did that so that you don't get the color
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:18.400]  bleeding you don't get the noise and it makes for really like the sample
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.280]  pictures and they said they were genuine and they're always very honest about
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.640]  that those sample pictures in low not just low light but when you had a light
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.800]  source in the middle or on the sides and an otherwise low light setting they
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:31.120]  look spectacular yeah and it really does seem like the color balancing that
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.600]  they're doing is really the tone that they're getting off the sensor is is
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:38.600]  extraordinary so I'm super you know always super excited about it and it's
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:44.820]  if there's any way that I can justify in a logical sense my buy a new iPhone
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:50.160]  every year it's the ever-increasing quality of the camera and the
[02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:55.380]  ever-increasing proportion of the photos I take every year that I take with my
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:59.820]  iPhone like buying a new iPhone every year is you know is going to make the
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:04.400]  pictures I take on my family in the year 2016 better than they would be if I
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.620]  didn't and that's what I like is that goal I think their goal is not to do a
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.680]  bunch of crazy stuff their goal is that you take the phone from your pocket and
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:14.520]  you snap something that's important to you and the better chance you have of
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.080]  getting a great shot is the bet is what they're gonna focus their ambitions in
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:24.720]  photography are boundless there there is no limit to it there is no good for
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:30.440]  good for a phone sort of mindset their their goal and you know and in their
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:34.840]  mind I think internally they still feel like the camera in the iPhone 6s and
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:39.880]  6s plus is shitty that they're their goals are so far ahead for where they
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.640]  want to get to and I feel like that's that sort of doggedness is what you need
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.520]  to get the sort of iterative improvements that we're getting every
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.400]  year they consider themselves a camera company oh absolutely
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:54.320]  Schiller said that on stage with me at the show I said what I said one of you
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.360]  know you know do you do you consider yourselves one of the leading camera
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:00.880]  companies in the world and he said the leading camera company yeah I mean he
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.720]  was I think it was the only time in the whole interview where he sort of bragged
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.680]  a little bit and they're like the chips they will spend boundless amounts of
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:10.840]  money because they don't make money on the camera they make it on the entire
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:14.040]  iPhone and that affords them the luxury of deeply investing in these technologies
[02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:19.760]  yeah it's really really interesting anything else on the phone I don't want
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:23.280]  to I want to I want to get to iOS 9 so I'd rather we can talk yeah like
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:26.920]  interesting wireless and stuff but yeah yeah we can talk about that detail later
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:32.480]  I want to do one more sponsor and I talk to you about ios 9 and our last sponsor
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:37.840]  another one of our good friends by which I mean a returning sponsor is our
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:43.240]  friends at Casper you guys know Casper Casper sells obsessively engineered
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:48.240]  mattresses at shockingly fair prices just the right sink just the right bounce
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:52.760]  that's their slogan so how are they made they have to take two technologies from
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:56.920]  modern mattresses latex foam and memory foam and they put them together for a
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:01.720]  better night better night's sleep memory foam in particular that's the one that
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.160]  you kind of sink into and it forms a shape data it's not just pure memory
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:09.160]  foam because pure memory foam really bothers a lot of people you really kind
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:11.880]  of sink into it a lot of people think it's hot because you just sort of end up
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:16.380]  like almost submerged in the thing and the fact that you get up and it doesn't
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:20.880]  just return to form so they mix memory foam technology with latex foam and
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:23.600]  it's just one thing and so you don't that's one of the things I really like
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.160]  about this too with Casper is really all you do with Casper is you pick what size
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.960]  mattress you want and then they just send you the one with their they're just
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:35.440]  the right sink just the right bounce mixture of foam so you don't like pick
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:38.620]  all right I want a queen-size bed and then you got to pick between like small
[02:11:38.620 --> 02:11:43.600]  medium large squishiness or something like that which a I think would bother
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:49.080]  me in any case and B would be how in the world would you do that online so they
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:52.400]  just do it right they've spent tons of time this I mean the whole company is
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:56.360]  really built around the the foam that they make these mattresses out of and
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:02.160]  they're the experts they know more than I do about foam and you know what you
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:07.720]  think feels better in like a two-minute test in a store where you're laying on a
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:12.120]  mattress that a lot of other people have laid on which is really gross but what
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.200]  you think in two minutes on a mattress has nothing to do with what you think
[02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:21.120]  what's actually going to be good for you for like years of sleeping eight or nine
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:27.440]  hours or if you're me 10 or 11 hours a night they just do it right now buying a
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:30.400]  mattress online crazy right because how you gonna buy a mattress if you've never

[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.980]  technology they're all over a thousand dollars maybe $2,000 here's their prices
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:11.160]  500 bucks for a twin size mattress 950 for a king-size mattress and the other
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:15.680]  sizes are you know right where you would think in between 500 and 950 compare
[02:13:15.680 --> 02:13:18.640]  that to the industry averages go out there I dare you to find a better deal
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.880]  it's an outstanding price point they make this happen by just getting rid of

[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.720]  really left a lot of time for this luckily here's the thing I reason I
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:31.680]  wanted you on this week I've read your review you were nice enough to give me
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:38.800]  advanced access to it really really comprehensive I it again just like the
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.320]  phone itself you can say looking at iOS 9 wow this doesn't look that like that
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:47.760]  big a deal year-over-year you I read your review and really dig into
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:52.320]  everything that's new and it almost seems it it just seems like it's too
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:55.760]  much year-over-year like not too much like it's overwhelming the user but too
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:59.880]  much I can't believe Apple pulled off all of this yeah I mean I thought I was
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:02.640]  in for an easy year because like the rumor was they punted a lot of stuff
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.160]  till the future and even if that's the case there I just kept writing and it
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:09.800]  wasn't that I wanted to write this much about it I would have much preferred to
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:13.640]  you know go to Vegas or something but this it there was just so much in it and
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:16.760]  it was so much stuff that wasn't really apparent because when they gave the list
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:22.440]  that tentpole list like new notes app and you news app the smarter Siri but
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:25.680]  when you start digging into it I mean they didn't even put content blockers up
[02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:29.480]  on stage that was all in the sessions there was so much just incredibly
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:33.640]  interesting technology and things that really make the experience it seems like
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:37.400]  they're really focused on performance but not just how fast the processor goes
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:41.040]  but how fast you can move around the system and how enjoyable that experience
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:46.760]  is this is that's a most common question I've been getting today from people is
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:50.880]  and it makes sense it's because everybody out there who hasn't been
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.800]  running the beta over summer which is smart now has the option of upgrading
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:59.560]  and they already have a phone and their phone is working okay pretty good and
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:03.120]  they're worried I think and it makes sense the biggest worry people have is
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.960]  they're gonna upgrade to iOS 9 and it's gonna feel slow yeah I I ran it all
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:14.120]  summer long and not not since WWDC like you but I upgraded to 9 on my daily
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:18.920]  carry iPhone 6 at some point in July so it was about a month after it came out
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:25.680]  and never once regretted it now I found so that you know again your mileage may
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:30.640]  vary out there I found that it was as fast or faster there was never a point
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:34.440]  where I thought I saw animation stuttering that didn't stutter before
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:38.520]  it it felt pretty good and in fact I would have to say that for betas
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:41.800]  especially for ones that I was running since July I found the whole OS to be
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:45.520]  remarkably stable the one thing that I always point out to people is that when
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:48.840]  you first download and you first install a new version of iOS there's so much
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.840]  that's going on internally it's you know updating libraries it's migrating data
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.960]  it's reindexing all the spotlight stuff especially this year with all the new
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:59.520]  spotlight thing that it is gonna be operating as fast as it can for a while
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.320]  it's gonna be using the radios are gonna be on and the process is gonna be on and
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:06.640]  it may not be the best experience but give it that day give it that data
[02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.560]  update and then sort of make up your mind yeah like just because it's let you
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.480]  restart and log in and go through the you know the little welcome you know
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:18.720]  thing that you go through when you do a major update doesn't mean that it's done
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.600]  with everything yeah yeah did you find that do you find it to be as fast or
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.680]  faster I find it to be better and I did some tests with one of the betas on an
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:30.240]  iPhone 4s and it was very good I don't I want to do it on the release version
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.500]  I've had a chance yet because that to me is a really honest test and let you
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:37.360]  install it let it wait a day and then try everything on it but Apple seemed
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:42.040]  especially laser focused after last year to make the the ability to install and
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.500]  run iOS even better so they're shedding a lot of things that don't need to be on
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:48.740]  older devices they're even shedding features when you know people would like
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:51.800]  every feature but some of them don't make sense on lower powered the floor
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:55.460]  processor powered devices and they're doing all that there they thin down the
[02:17:55.460 --> 02:17:59.840]  OS to one gigabyte they're doing all the app thinning stuff they are they really
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.480]  want because they have relatives I think you've said this they have relatives who
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:05.160]  are running these devices and they want that to be a great experience yeah and
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:08.920]  they want people to update to another iPhone they don't get pissed off and go
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.800]  to another phone so it really behooves them to get all this right yeah I think
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.880]  it was one of the things that I think most annoys people in in Apple from Tim
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:20.640]  Cook I think down but especially to the people who work on this stuff is that
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:25.920]  really annoys them that there's there's this widespread belief that Apple
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.840]  purposefully makes a new version of iOS make your old film slow old phone feel
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:33.120]  slow so that you'll upgrade to a new phone right away
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:37.680]  Google iPhone slow at peak velocity because every single iPhone in the world
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:41.280]  is updated on the same day where every Android phone is updated on other days
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:46.320]  so they Google that over an entire year it doesn't peak it and that's not to say
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:49.080]  that it hasn't happened that's not to say that there haven't been iOS updates
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.240]  that have performed disappointingly on older hardware and and especially if
[02:18:53.240 --> 02:18:58.640]  you're maybe two years behind and there's the hey isn't Apple the one
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:03.480]  angle is isn't it great that Apple supports so many years back of iPhone
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:08.960]  models as opposed to Android where you know this year's new version of Android
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:13.800]  you know it often it's only is you know available on phones going back one year
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:18.120]  but the flip side of that is that there have been some releases where the lowest
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:26.960]  supported phone especially performs worse than that and you know it it is
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:30.560]  what it is and whether that's a mistake or not or strategically on Apple's part
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:33.840]  but the people you know who hear it they're nothing but disappointed in
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:37.840]  themselves for it yeah they really are and they and they really do their
[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:43.280]  interest is not in selling or their primary interest is not in selling this
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:46.800]  year's new phone right now to as many people as possible their interest is in
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:51.960]  making as many people as possible happy and satisfied I iPhone customers so that
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:55.840]  their next phone whenever they buy it will be an iPhone and that one way that
[02:19:55.840 --> 02:19:59.840]  the easiest way they could burn through that is by making people think things
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:05.600]  like hey Apple is just trying to screw you with the iOS updates you know and
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:08.760]  make your phone feel slow yeah when I heard they were gonna support everything
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:11.480]  that iOS 8 supported I felt that they were probably pretty confident that
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:15.560]  they've got this under control yeah I think so I have heard and I'd maybe they
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:18.800]  even announced this I don't even know if that I don't know why they would but I
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:25.080]  going back to WWDC I had heard that they were doing a lot more you know have
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:29.560]  engineers actually carry older phones for some period of time during
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:33.040]  development or for whatever they're working on and so that it's not just
[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:38.280]  like oh go install it on an iPhone 5 and run a few tests and see if it's alright
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:43.160]  but you know have you know do some serious dog-fooding on older iPhones
[02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:48.000]  themselves just to sort of keep themselves honest no better motivator in
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.680]  the world I don't know if that's true though because I mean how do you find
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:21:02.640]  the volunteers to do that what is going on this isn't it's something even having
[02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:06.640]  ready to review I'm not 100% sure on so with the new notes app the new notes app
[02:21:06.640 --> 02:21:12.120]  is a major major update it really does like you say like you previously used
[02:21:12.120 --> 02:21:16.480]  Apple's built-in notes as sort of a and it's exactly how I've used it for a long
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:21.880]  time as a multi-device multi-platform clipboard where for a couple of pieces
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:26.240]  of text or URLs or something like that something where even like handoff isn't
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:30.280]  quite what you want because you want to do it later or something yes just put
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:33.360]  something here and then I know from there you know whether I'm on my phone
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.160]  or whether I'm on my Mac I can put something there and then later when I'm
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:40.880]  on something else I can go and I know where it is I can get it and then I can
[02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:45.000]  usually I just delete them you know it's a little temporary things and that notes
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.660]  now the built-in notes app is now a serious notes app and it's got you know
[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:56.360]  a lot more pages like features with titles and headings and stuff like that
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:22:02.960]  and styles and and built-in checklists and a lot more features related to image
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:07.680]  attachments and you can do doodles in them now too yeah and they even and
[02:22:07.680 --> 02:22:13.760]  that's pressure sensitive on a success which is really nice it's crazy yeah
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:17.800]  but I don't I don't see that yet and I think it's because I haven't hit the
[02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:22.280]  upgrade button is that right is that that's the that's the thing you have to
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:27.080]  do to get those new features and then the hitch with the upgrade button it's
[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:31.800]  just sort of like you're going from the old notes to the new notes and yeah when
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:35.960]  you go to the new notes the the biggest thing is that syncing only takes place
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:40.960]  through iCloud Drive and there it's no longer doing that hack that used based
[02:22:40.960 --> 02:22:48.360]  on iMap folders yes but the hitch is once you've done it you've kind of got a
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:52.100]  you know you got to get everything on the latest and greatest and the thing
[02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:55.960]  I've been putting off and probably will put off for a while is upgrading my max
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:23:00.960]  to El Capitan yeah it's because they still don't really and I don't want them
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.440]  to release everything on the same day but every year now we're having this
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:07.400]  thing where half of something is ready on iOS in September and then you have to
[02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.640]  wait till October to have the other half of it like I think it was iCloud Drive
[02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:14.280]  last year and it was something else the year before yeah so if anybody out there
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:18.620]  is confused I thought I had the story but I just wanted to make sure with you
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:21.760]  but if anybody's out there is confused why they can't put doodles in their
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:26.800]  notes even after they upgrade to iOS 9 it's it's because you're like me and you
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:29.280]  didn't do this upgrade which they're very clear about they did once you
[02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:32.360]  upgrade this then the syncing you'll need your need your max on El Capitan to
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:36.160]  do the syncing and you know if you're not the old systems just not capable of
[02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:39.400]  syncing all the data types that are in the new notes app yeah I don't blame
[02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:42.760]  them I don't I in fact that makes it makes more I'd be more worried if they
[02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:46.440]  let it if they tried to do it you know I really would because the whole iMap
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:50.800]  syncing thing that notes did was a clever workaround but it's a terrible
[02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:57.720]  terrible hack like using iMap as the syncing back for notes is is just a
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:02.800]  terrible hack yeah no yeah and this this is a nice clean modern not just a nice
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:06.940]  clean modern notes app but a nice clean modern architecture for it yeah so I'm
[02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:11.760]  really looking forward to that but I wanted to see it what about Apple news
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:16.760]  do you use it I have used it a little bit Apple news is one of those things
[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:19.560]  where it's not it's only officially supported in the US right now it's
[02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:22.440]  supposed to be in the UK in Australia there was an article saying it's being
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:27.680]  delayed in the UK and that and so I had to flip my my iPhone to the US in order
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:31.280]  to get it and I'm getting directions in miles whatever the hell those are but
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:35.280]  it's it it's and as people weren't putting content in yet because it wasn't
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.480]  really switched on but it's a huge it's a huge interesting thing for me because
[02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  is it really worth the while of wired and vanity fair and all these articles
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.560]  to make content specific for Apple news and to sell ads and yes you can funnel
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:51.880]  in your old ads but you can also sell I add specifically for it and this goes
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:54.760]  into the whole content blocker discussion but a lot of companies just
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:57.500]  don't want to have to deal with that complexity they want one place to go to
[02:24:57.500 --> 02:25:01.520]  sell ads in one place to go to buy ads and they want one type of content that
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.680]  they can you know spit out a PDF or a ping and put it everywhere so I just
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:08.720]  want to see what sort of reward Apple gives people like whether it's going to
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:11.720]  be huge volumes of eyeballs that makes them want to put in the effort to
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:15.840]  support all of this I find I've tried to get into it and it just never sticks and
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.440]  there's nothing I can put my finger on that's wrong with it and sometimes I've
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:23.880]  you know I've found plenty of you know in articles that I've enjoyed but I
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:27.640]  never find my I always the only reason I ever go to it is because I think I want
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:31.520]  to get to know this you know this is new it seems important to me I mean it seems
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:35.040]  important on a couple levels as a user but it also seems important to me as the
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:37.920]  guy who runs during fireball I got to understand this but the only reason I
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:42.840]  ever launch it and I've been like I said I've been running the iOS since since
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:49.200]  July I only go there when I force myself to go there it just isn't for me I don't
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:52.840]  find it compelling but I don't know see I it's one of those things that this is
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:57.200]  a app in particular I really want to get to know it but it really like what do I
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:26:00.980]  do what does John Gruber do in some sense I'm like a professional news
[02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:08.220]  junkie like yes what I do is like my my career is being an obsessive news junkie
[02:26:08.220 --> 02:26:13.000]  who reads and reads and reads and so maybe it's no surprise that this isn't
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.400]  for me this is meant for people who aren't news junkies so they don't have
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.920]  to be a news junkie to stay up to date well it's a weird experience too because
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:24.000]  it does run off of RSS but you know a lot of a lot of people don't give full
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.240]  RSS feeds then you start reading a paragraph and you have to tap a button
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.360]  then you go into a web view and I don't even think it's Safari view controller
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.600]  and then you can't like you can go to I can go to daring fireball but if I've
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.720]  heard that John did a great article on something I can't search to find that I
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:40.880]  have to swipe to find it then if I go to the topic that you wrote about I can't
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.480]  find that publication so it's not really it's not really suited to someone who's
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:49.760]  used to net news wire or reader or something like that it really is meant
[02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:54.680]  it is way better in many ways than the news stand app because not everything is
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.280]  a completely different user experience every time you launch it but it feels
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:01.760]  like one of those things where it might take in a year from now we'll see if
[02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:04.440]  it's either really really good or it's just not going to go anywhere yeah it's
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:08.800]  nothing like news 10 because newsstand was at the root level nothing but
[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:12.720]  literally I mean it was a great name for it newsstand was well-named I don't
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:16.280]  think it was a great idea but it was well-named because it's just like going
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:20.680]  to a newsstand you just see a bunch of covers for publications and if anything
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:23.240]  you learned less from newsstand because at least when you look at a real news
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:26.240]  then you may be able to read the headlines on the covers and you have to
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.200]  pick something and you go off and everything remains in its own silo like
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:33.660]  with Apple news stuff is intermingled and you'll get like a thing from the New
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:39.240]  York Times and a thing from Sports Illustrated and whatever but it just
[02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:43.500]  isn't for me and I didn't really expect it to be but you know I'm just curious
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:47.880]  to see once it rolls out how many people really take to it yeah and also it's
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:50.460]  like they've had they've been doing things with the servers in the back end
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:53.440]  for a long time and ideally it's gonna be like Apple music where you go to for
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:56.100]  you it wants to learn about your preferences and present you with a bunch
[02:27:56.100 --> 02:28:00.040]  of interesting stuff you may not have found yet but how well that hits and
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.960]  misses will determine a great deal of what the value is to you yeah I thought
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:09.040]  it was so interesting I love the way that you include in your links in your
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.480]  review your links to all your previous reviews and you have the icons the icon
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:20.200]  logos that Apple is used for each OS release and the ones for seven eight nine
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:24.840]  are just sort of the same except that yes it's just seven eight nine you know
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.800]  you know I wonder I actually didn't even think to notice because the nines look
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.320]  similar but I bet they switched the nine to San Francisco from Helvetica Noya but
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.520]  they're all the same and whereas the ones for two three four five six are all
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:42.940]  like all over the place yeah and I reflect whatever the skeuomorphic
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:46.760]  Tennessee was at the time yeah I think it really epitomizes what I mentioned
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:50.360]  to you you know a while back on this episode that it it just shows that the
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:58.960]  design of i07 is really started starting with i07 really matured anything else I
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:02.040]  guess the only thing I can think of that's really I really want to hit hit
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:05.200]  your thinking on because you know just item by item item by item I'm just gonna
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:09.400]  send people to your just go read Renee's review the show's gone on long enough
[02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:15.880]  but what about the the deep linking that to me so you know mutual friend Marco
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.900]  Arman he has an app called overcast and I was just playing around with it and I
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:22.920]  had an episode of daring fireball or ATP or something and I said remind me of
[02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:26.680]  this and I said okay I'll remind you of this and put the little overcast icon in
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:29.340]  and then I went and listened to a bunch of other shows and then I went back to
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:32.620]  reminders and tapped on it and it took me back to the episode I wanted to be
[02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.700]  reminded of so I pinged Marco and I said did you set this up and he said no and I
[02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:39.700]  started looking into it and it turns out that because he'd enabled continuity
[02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:43.600]  continuity does the activity indexing that that's exactly what they were using
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.520]  and they were using that for the back button and they were using that not in a
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.480]  creepy way so basically anytime you leave an app it just drops a bookmark
[02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:53.160]  and then it'll take you right back to there anytime you leave a reminder just
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:56.200]  drops a bookmark to where you were and takes you right back to there and this
[02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:59.840]  is a technology that they created for continuity and there's another
[02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:03.280]  continuity technology that let you move from your website to an app back and
[02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:06.800]  forth and they use that essentially for universal links so if I get a Twitter
[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:11.200]  article in messages I can tap on it and instead of going to mobile dot Twitter
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:14.680]  calm like an animal I go to the Twitter app and if that Twitter apps not
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:17.200]  installed it doesn't care it's a universal link it goes back to the
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:21.120]  mobile Twitter site and all of these things just work seamlessly I think
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:24.520]  that's what they're calling it seamless linking based on existing technology so
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:27.960]  you know it really like if Marco had to do extra work to support it it wouldn't
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:31.000]  bother me that much but you know he's got enough to do already and he got all
[02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.440]  of that for free essentially and to me that's one of the the really awesome
[02:30:34.440 --> 02:30:38.280]  aspects of iOS 9 is how it took all this stuff and gave us tremendous new
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:43.440]  features for almost no effort yeah and I also think it's it's it no additional
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:48.360]  cognitive load on the user yeah figure it out and you get the hang of it you
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:53.120]  you you're moving around faster but if you don't if you just ignore it you
[02:30:53.120 --> 02:30:57.760]  you're not you're not bothered by anything new there's nothing new to do
[02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:04.240]  III almost worry that some of the the richness of this is just going to go
[02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:09.280]  unnoticed because it's so it's so not in your face but like I would have never
[02:31:09.280 --> 02:31:13.440]  even thought that like that's something that's new to me that you can just go to
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:17.520]  Syria and what so you're listening to a show and then you jump to Siri and say
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:21.600]  remind me of this later it's not just a show like if you send me a text message
[02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.040]  or I get an email and you just say remind me of this and it'll put the icon
[02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:29.720]  for that app into reminders and deep link to the spot in the app that you
[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:33.920]  were in when you made that that request yeah I can just imagine right now how
[02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:39.320]  many listeners of this podcast are right now in in overcast listening to us say
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:43.040]  this and they're trying it right now saying remind me of this later and
[02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:46.840]  they're making a reminder of this of me and you talking about this right now
[02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:50.560]  because it's great and you can say things like remind me of this like
[02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:53.000]  remind me to listen to this when I get in the car and if you plug into a car
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:56.960]  kit it knows that you're plugged into a car and it's just very clever the thing
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:02.280]  that's really hit me is because the the back buttons that go in the top left
[02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:06.760]  like when you jump to a web link from something and then Safari has a back to
[02:32:06.760 --> 02:32:10.640]  wherever you're from like back to mail
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:15.720]  it's looked clever and I thought this was the soon as I saw it at WWDC I
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:19.080]  thought that what I'm about to say was the case but in a summer of using it it
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:25.120]  is the case where for years one of my you know pet peeves have been the
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:32.000]  hardware or system level back buttons on Android and Windows Phone and and to me
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.920]  it's the single biggest mistake that Windows Phone made because Android was
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:39.120]  already out and the designers of Windows Phone which I think is a really well
[02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:45.040]  designed system overall really should have seen the inherent problems of that
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:51.320]  button and again like everything it's trade-offs there are times when you just
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:56.320]  want a go back to where I was right before this even if it's a different app
[02:32:56.320 --> 02:33:00.400]  you've done you've opened a link you're in a browser window now you want to go
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:05.120]  back to where you were and that's the counter-argument from the Android people
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:10.340]  that is the why this you know it's supposedly a good design but among the
[02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:13.560]  many problems that I've had every time I've ever used an Android phone no matter
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:17.360]  how long how long I've given with it is that for every time that it works and
[02:33:17.360 --> 02:33:21.120]  takes you back where you want to go there's all there another time where it
[02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:26.200]  takes you somewhere where you didn't want to go yeah they conflate inter and
[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:30.920]  intra app navigation exactly so a lot of collisions that's exactly it in tra and
[02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:36.680]  inter app navigation and it's just and it's never labeled it's just a back
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:41.640]  button whereas in iOS it's extremely clear it tells you exactly where you'll
[02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:48.000]  be going back and it only it is only up there for when it remains contextually
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:52.000]  useful so like if you switch from mail to Safari it's up there and then if you
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.160]  just stick around in Safari making new tabs and stuff it goes away yeah it's
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:59.640]  great and the Safari view controller doesn't have a back button and now it's
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:03.400]  you can't just swipe backwards but then there's collisions about swiping back
[02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:07.560]  inside the view controller and through the app so I understand why that's like
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:10.560]  that but you can just see so almost you don't have to do the double click
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:13.440]  anymore and then try to hunt for your app to go to the home screen and try to
[02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:16.720]  hunt back where you're going to you you can just go to an app go right back and
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:20.680]  the iPhone is a single column it's not like the iPad where for example you can
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.400]  just tap a bunch of messages in the list view and see the details change quickly
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:28.640]  you had to tap go to another message tap go to another message tap messages go
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:32.280]  out and they have done all this stuff from the backlink and the deep linking
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:36.480]  to the 3d touch to make navigating a single column interlaced just almost
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:41.960]  accelerated yeah I think you know if there's anything that surprised me and
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:46.080]  how much it's affected just not affected like it's like revolutionized my use of
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:52.680]  the iPhone or iOS in general because all of its supplies to the iPad as well but
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:59.060]  it's it's that stuff yeah I just I can't live without it I went back to using an
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:02.720]  iOS 8.4 device when Apple music was coming out I'd kept trying to hit it and
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:07.600]  it wasn't there and it really was a blockage on my enjoying on the device
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.280]  anything else you want to say before before we truly wrap it up on me and I'm
[02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:15.800]  out I mean I could talk to you for another three hours about iOS 9 but but
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.520]  we've got it I like the multitasking I really like that the multitasking I mean
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.560]  it's limited on other devices but they did give the slide over so even if
[02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:25.800]  you're on an older iPad you can use that but just the ability to have multiple
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.280]  apps there and to start you don't necessarily need it all the time but
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:32.400]  when you do need it if you're watching something and tweets are coming in or if
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.320]  you're trying to write notes while you're referring to a web page it's
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:39.240]  another way where it just enables you to do more without continuously carouseling
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:43.480]  out to a different app and that to me is a tremendous time-saver yeah and I think
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:47.120]  the thing you have to get used to is and it comes for you it'll come to you if
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:49.320]  you don't even think about it but what you have to get used to is if you see
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:52.720]  two things on screen at once the one on the left is primary and the one on the
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:57.640]  right is secondary even if you're 50 50 even if like on the iPad you've gone to
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:03.720]  50 50 if you command tab the command tab is switching the primary and the
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:06.900]  secondary is still secondary and you just remember it just remember that
[02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:09.600]  primaries on the left secondary is on the right and you can switch them if you
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:16.800]  want and it it all just sort of makes sense as the thing on the left is
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:21.300]  exactly what you're used to in iOS since forever and the thing on the right is a
[02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:24.640]  new thing you're able to do which is you're allowed to have a secondary thing
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:30.320]  open on the right and it yeah you know if if anybody out there is concerned
[02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:36.080]  that this is adding I mean it's obviously is adding complexity but it's
[02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:42.320]  not adding to me confusion and you don't have to I mean it's one of those things
[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:45.120]  where like note of there's people who just don't know that notification center
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:48.760]  or us control center are there they have a wonderful experience without any of
[02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:52.880]  that stuff but if you do need more it's almost like depth of design you people
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:56.180]  who are just nominally interested they get the first layer and they're happy
[02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:59.240]  but if you want to put in the effort and dig deeper you have greater levels of
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:02.760]  functionality I think that's a really good way of staging design yeah it's
[02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:07.560]  amazing how much that they've gotten out of side swipes over the years yes from
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:10.120]  and I don't think there was anything I think in the original iPhone there was
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:13.760]  nothing that you got from any of the sides because there was no control center
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:17.400]  no control center no navigate no
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:23.520]  notification center and now it's you know but it's if you've discovered
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:27.360]  either of those things the the way that you saw it slide in from the side to
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.920]  open up a second app is is very natural yeah and they're in the same thing with
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:35.200]  3d touch they're using it consistently and consistency is a user facing feature
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:38.640]  because if you can't predict and rely on it you stop trying but if it's there
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:41.080]  when you when you just you don't even think about using it it just becomes
[02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:44.640]  natural then it becomes part of your workflow yeah that's one of the things
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:48.400]  I'm really curious about as iOS 9 rolls out into the real world is as I you know
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.800]  do my like go into a coffee shop and see what devices people are using and you
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:57.680]  know I I'm keen to keep in airports is another place where I always do it yeah
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:01.720]  keen to see whether this becomes something like when you're going back to
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:04.840]  your seat from the restroom on an airplane and you're just looking at what
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:11.320]  devices people are using how many people are using split-screen iPads yeah and
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:18.240]  with keyboards and pencils yeah Renee Richie thank you for your time people
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.160]  can forget more Renee number one you can go to I'm more calm right now and find
[02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:32.760]  is comprehensive iOS 9 review on Twitter you are Renee Richie yes and your
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:38.160]  podcasts what are your all your podcasts I always forget it I do debug with guy
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:41.880]  English where we talk to developers about developer stuff we do vector with
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:45.440]  Georgia and guy and Dave was kiss which is more about how humanity affects
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:50.920]  technology and I do iterate with Seth and Mark Edwards about design well there
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:55.320]  we go the talented podcaster prolific slow down a little bit all right I'm
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:39:00.600]  trying I am and I'll talk to you soon thanks for the good work and thanks for
