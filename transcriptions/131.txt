[00:00.000 --> 00:07.680]  Oh, man, what a day. Yeah, crazy. We are recording on Wednesday, uh, the 16th show party out tomorrow. Um,
[00:08.880 --> 00:16.800]  Wow. What's even happened so far today? So far today, watch OS 2.0 has been postponed indefinitely.
[00:16.800 --> 00:24.160]  My guess is for a few days, uh, due to some sort of last minute bug that is popped up in which Apple is
[00:24.160 --> 00:29.600]  not describing. Yeah, it doesn't sound like a user facing bug. Those sounds more like a developer facing bug.
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.440]  Do you think so? Yeah, and if you're on the GM or if you're on the beta, you don't have any reason to be
[00:35.920 --> 00:39.920]  concerned about anything. But if you remember last year, I think they were problems with
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.080]  extension signing and then with the health kit apps and it took them a week or so to figure those out.
[00:44.080 --> 00:47.360]  I was, I was wondering if maybe it was some kind of bug that affects the upgrade process.
[00:47.360 --> 00:56.880]  Maybe, I mean, the beta upgrade worked fine. Yeah. And it just, it seemed more like a not front facing issue than a front facing issue. Yeah.
[00:56.880 --> 01:06.080]  Um, I don't know, though. It's hard to say, but yeah, you know, I think anybody wants to complain and, you know,
[01:06.080 --> 01:11.680]  it bugs happen. I mean, it's a hell of a lot better for Apple to find a bug before it ships. And
[01:11.680 --> 01:18.160]  obviously, it's a little embarrassing for them to have pronounced the date and have to be anchored. But comparing contrast with
[01:18.160 --> 01:26.480]  the, um, what was a nine, nine point 0.1 last year, 8.0 point one, oh, 8.0 point one nine nine is this year.
[01:26.480 --> 01:33.600]  No, I got damn it. No, it might as well be a Monday. Remember the 8.0 point one last year came out
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.280]  and it didn't break everybody's phone. But for some subset of users who were downloading it over the air,
[01:39.280 --> 01:45.200]  it temporarily brick, they killed touch ID and it killed LTE. So if you were Jesse char, you
[01:45.200 --> 01:51.600]  noticed no problems whatsoever. But if you're anyone else, wait, she doesn't get LTE. I don't think
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.480]  she uses her phone as a phone. I think it was just a phone call part. Oh, I got you. All right,
[01:56.480 --> 02:05.840]  better fingers to not register. Um, what else has happened today? So iOS nine is rolling out as we speak.
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.720]  Yes. Um, and one interesting thing you mentioned before the show started it does have a different
[02:10.720 --> 02:18.160]  build number than the GM that Apple distributed, uh, was that last week? Yeah, the GM is 40 and the,
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.320]  the release version is 44. So obviously it's something something minor at least in their
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.800]  change so far. So good on that from what I've seen. Yeah, absolutely. And if you do have the GM,
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.040]  uh, you'll get a software updates, very small. If you make a, I think 100 megabytes or something.
[02:33.040 --> 02:41.440]  Yeah. Um, content blockers are rolling out, which I think is going to be a major, um,
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.560]  it's interesting to see how this is going to be because this is the sort of thing that is going
[02:48.560 --> 02:56.160]  to change, uh, a lot for people like me and maybe I don't know. And it's also the only sort of app
[02:56.160 --> 02:59.760]  that you can really look for this. I mean, last year, there was all sorts of share extensions and
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.560]  action extensions and widgets and the only really big new kind of app you can get this year is
[03:04.560 --> 03:09.920]  content blockers. So they get featured more than anything else. Right. In terms of, and it's funny too,
[03:09.920 --> 03:14.880]  and, and, you know, I'll get to it because you've written a massive, massive review, but it does,
[03:14.880 --> 03:23.200]  it's one of those things though that makes it hard to, uh, judge these OS releases by based on,
[03:23.200 --> 03:29.040]  even if you just assume that the GM is good, you know, is real, it's hard to judge the OS as a whole
[03:29.040 --> 03:36.160]  until after it ships and you have some time to use it with the real world stuff that, that ships.
[03:36.160 --> 03:42.000]  In other words, I, nobody's going to really form a serious opinion of iOS nine until after
[03:43.040 --> 03:47.360]  the content blockers have come out and people have picked the ones they want, if any,
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.280]  and see how that affects their, their usage. And there was ways to beta test them beforehand,
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.360]  but, um, you know, it's like you men, maybe you didn't get to beta test all of them.
[03:55.360 --> 03:59.200]  Yeah. And even I discussed this about the watch too, like just testing complications and how much
[03:59.200 --> 04:02.800]  that would actually change your workflow. It's going to be very different. Yeah, I thought the
[04:02.800 --> 04:07.120]  same thing and I don't have any beta apps. I don't even know if that was possible with the watch.
[04:07.120 --> 04:15.360]  So I have been playing with watch OS 2.0 for a few weeks now, but I haven't written anything
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.480]  about it because I don't, I don't see how I can judge it until after the complications come out.
[04:20.480 --> 04:28.080]  And really, frankly, even just native apps in general on the watch and see if it solves some of
[04:28.080 --> 04:35.680]  the, um, you know, just so slow to launch problems that we've seen with the watch kit 1.0 watches.
[04:35.680 --> 04:39.440]  Yeah, whether it's like slow apps or whether the watch isn't the same kind of app platform that
[04:39.440 --> 04:45.840]  maybe the phone or the tablet were. Yeah, it's just impossible for me at least to, to make a
[04:45.840 --> 04:50.560]  judgment of it until, you know, after this shakes out, we live with it for a while. You mean
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.080]  calling what I write reviews is kind of half a lie because most of them are just trying to explain
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.240]  how things work and how you can juggle the different options. Yeah, I thought of that too,
[04:58.240 --> 05:03.360]  because I linked to your review at Imore, your iOS 9 review. And it's just what it says,
[05:03.360 --> 05:08.480]  iOS 9 review. And at this point, your nine versions into writing these things, you might as well
[05:08.480 --> 05:16.960]  not change it now. But review is, it sells it short in some ways, and it's misleading in others,
[05:16.960 --> 05:22.000]  because it's not really review sort of is like, is this good? Is this bad? And there's obviously
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.720]  some of that, but it's really more just like, I don't know, like, everything you would want to know
[05:28.720 --> 05:35.040]  about iOS 9. Yeah, it's fast ahead about the technology. Yeah. Well, but you do more than just
[05:35.040 --> 05:40.800]  the technology though. You, you, you absolutely write about it from the perspective of
[05:41.600 --> 05:48.880]  the experience. Like it's one thing to just say here, now you can do this and that. But yours
[05:48.880 --> 05:55.840]  is more, look, I've been banging on this thing for months, living with it. And here's, you know,
[05:55.840 --> 06:00.320]  here's what it's like. Like here's, here's not just a list of what's new in the no tap, for example,
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.480]  here's, you know, what this enables you to do with it. You know, it turns it into a totally
[06:04.480 --> 06:11.760]  different app now. Yeah, absolutely. Just to name one example. So when did you, to, to, to start
[06:11.760 --> 06:17.360]  using iOS 9 full time? Well, you made fun of me the day of the event, because I showed you,
[06:17.360 --> 06:24.400]  I put it on my phone already. So that was, that was WWDC. Yes. And I put it on my carry, and
[06:24.400 --> 06:28.080]  immediately, you know, I had no data signal. And it set me a while to get that working.
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.200]  Well, I think this year was actually a pretty good one for that. I mean, and if anybody,
[06:33.200 --> 06:39.520]  it's funny, if anybody would have reason to, to install it right on day one and start living
[06:39.520 --> 06:45.920]  over there, it would be someone like you or Federico, somebody who's planning on writing one of
[06:45.920 --> 06:53.200]  these comprehensive, and I mean it sincerely. I mean book length reviews of it. And you know,
[06:53.200 --> 06:56.720]  the rough timeline. And again, you know, this year we can, you know, talk about the fact that
[06:56.720 --> 07:02.480]  Apple's not having an October event. But that, the October event was always the one if there's
[07:02.480 --> 07:06.960]  only going to be one event. That's the one that was going to be dropped, because September is
[07:06.960 --> 07:11.200]  just sort of set in stone for the phones. I mean, and again, you never know something
[07:11.200 --> 07:16.240]  unforeseen could happen that would delay it. But, you know, we had a, it was a pretty good bet
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.200]  that iOS 9 was going to ship sometime in the first two weeks of September.
[07:21.200 --> 07:25.200]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this event going all the way back to the iPod days is the holiday event
[07:25.200 --> 07:28.560]  for Apple. They set up everything that they expect everyone's going to buy for the holidays.
[07:28.560 --> 07:31.440]  Yeah. Yeah. Even back to when they called it the music events.
[07:31.440 --> 07:36.000]  Yeah. You know, and it would just be, you know, before the iPhone, it was, this is when new iPods
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.600]  came out. And, you know, sometimes there'd be like a, it'd be weird. Sometimes there'd be like
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.280]  an iWork or something like that. Yeah, in the occasion, like I think they had the first
[07:45.280 --> 07:49.120]  unibody mac event in October, but those were always, they weren't regular for a while. They would
[07:49.120 --> 07:52.880]  just be when they had something to talk about. Right. So anyway, somebody like you who wants to
[07:52.880 --> 07:58.080]  write, and how many words was your review? How many? Like 22,000? So there you go. I mean, that's,
[07:58.080 --> 08:02.160]  you know, again, that's, that might be short for a book, but if you printed it out, it's,
[08:02.160 --> 08:06.560]  it's a lot more book length than it is article length. Yeah, I did take stuff out. Like I took
[08:06.560 --> 08:09.920]  out stuff that I thought was only developer appropriate or was getting too far into the nitty
[08:09.920 --> 08:15.600]  gritty. So I did cut a lot as well as wanted to keep it small book length. I mean, like a typical,
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.880]  I mean, it's hard to say what's typical these days with the way stuff gets cut, but something like
[08:20.880 --> 08:25.680]  a 4,000 word article, if you're doing like a freelance writer, that's like a feature article
[08:25.680 --> 08:30.480]  and a magazine for length. And I think, you know, books obviously range in thickness greatly,
[08:30.480 --> 08:35.520]  but I think once you're in measuring in the tens of thousands, it's book length or book
[08:35.520 --> 08:39.760]  lit length rather than article. And I was eight is, sorry, I was nine is Deceptus.
[08:39.760 --> 08:42.800]  Trinity did our Cole's notes version. Like this is the important stuff you need to know. And I
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.760]  think that hit for 6,000 words, just doing the rough take. That's pretty, it's pretty amazing.
[08:49.760 --> 08:57.280]  I think in broad terms, you know, I think everybody, you know, keeps trying to set the stage that
[08:58.080 --> 09:02.080]  everybody is writing about it. It's trying to set the stage. It's just the basic expectation,
[09:02.080 --> 09:05.760]  like for somebody who hasn't really been paying attention all summer, which is actually,
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.800]  you know, not a bad way to go if you're a lay person. Take a look, take a listen at WWDC,
[09:10.800 --> 09:14.960]  think about what interests you to now for the summer and wait to see what actually ships,
[09:14.960 --> 09:19.520]  because sometimes stuff drops and stuff like that. But everybody trying to give people the
[09:19.520 --> 09:23.920]  lay of the land, the basic gist is, okay, this is not like a radical upgrade like iOS 7,
[09:23.920 --> 09:28.640]  this is a year over year thing, which is fair enough. And I don't disagree with that. But
[09:30.080 --> 09:36.880]  I don't think we're ever going to see an iOS 7 like update again for iOS. I think iOS 7 was
[09:36.880 --> 09:46.000]  where they reset to a foundation to build on for years, I mean, decades to come, I think.
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.000]  Yeah, I know I agree. I mean, if you look back in hindsight, maybe some of it was serendipitous,
[09:50.000 --> 09:54.880]  maybe some of it was planned, but you couldn't get to iOS 9 without iOS 7 and iOS 8. Like,
[09:54.880 --> 09:58.640]  you needed, you needed the kind of an interface that could go through the size class changes,
[09:58.640 --> 10:04.800]  that could go from being a regular to, to one of the smaller size classes. And you needed,
[10:05.520 --> 10:10.640]  so much of iOS 9 is built on extensibility. And I remember we talked last year about how
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.960]  transformative extensibility could be that it was literally uncoupling features from
[10:14.960 --> 10:19.200]  apps. It was, it was setting them free from the binary and they're doing everything from content
[10:19.200 --> 10:23.920]  blockers to Safari view controller to the gameplay recording is to a lot of the privacy stuff is
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.840]  all being done through extensibility. And all the search stuff is being done through continuity
[10:27.840 --> 10:31.840]  because they're indexing our activity. So they can take us back to it. They can use it as a reminder,
[10:31.840 --> 10:37.440]  it's all coming together really well in iOS 9. Yeah, I think so. But a lot of that really comes
[10:37.440 --> 10:48.160]  back to resetting, just just resetting the table for iOS 7 and saying this, let's get back to
[10:48.160 --> 10:51.760]  somewhere where we can build on and they knew where they needed to go. And some of that is just
[10:51.760 --> 10:58.000]  purely engineering and it didn't require necessarily a visual refresh, you know, like size classes
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.880]  and extensibility. Obviously, they could have done extensibility with the old look. I mean, it's
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.480]  nothing. But I think it was worth it for them. And I think this is the way they thought about it.
[11:08.480 --> 11:13.840]  It was worth it to do all this resetting at once and then build from there.
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.680]  Yeah, I agree. I mean, I just can't even imagine green felt or wood paneling changing from
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.560]  compact to regular size class on an iPad with split view. Yeah. I mean, and now look at
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.840]  Mac OS 10. I think Mac OS 10 is a good comparison. And it has had there have been a few times
[11:29.840 --> 11:35.520]  over the years where there's been a more significant visual refresh than others. Last year,
[11:35.520 --> 11:43.520]  for example, with Yosemite going to a more, it's again, not really iOS 7 look alike, but more
[11:43.520 --> 11:52.080]  like looks like a sibling to iOS 7. And a few years before that, there was the one where they got
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.640]  rid of all the metal and having two different window types, you know, the Aqua windows and the
[11:58.640 --> 12:07.120]  brushed metal windows. But those weren't radical, right? I don't, I think Yosemite maybe was
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.640]  arguably, but none of the previous ones really were radical in terms of having the sort of
[12:12.640 --> 12:18.640]  controversy that iOS 7 really, you know, almost the upheaval and the wow, this looks all together
[12:18.640 --> 12:24.720]  different sort of reaction. And I think iOS 7, I think that this look, I think it will evolve
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.960]  over time. Everything gets stale and fashions change. And obviously, even just the system font
[12:28.960 --> 12:33.840]  this year changed. So it'll evolve. And it might be some year coming where there's a more
[12:33.840 --> 12:39.840]  significant change than, than in recent times. But I really think that part of the plan with the
[12:39.840 --> 12:50.000]  iOS 7 look and going to a much more simpler and unadorned overall look was to get to something
[12:50.000 --> 12:58.480]  that's a little bit less about trendiness and a little bit more towards a design that's timeless,
[12:58.480 --> 13:04.000]  specifically so that they don't have to do things like that again and that they can just keep
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.160]  iterating like they have this year. I agree completely. Like I look at it almost in architectural
[13:08.160 --> 13:12.480]  terms and I just got great bones now and they can build out some differences like they can put in
[13:12.480 --> 13:16.960]  San Francisco and it refreshes everything or if they decide not to wait for quantum dot panels and
[13:16.960 --> 13:20.880]  they go with OLED panels and they need a night theme because that's better on OLED. They can
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.480]  add all that in. But the structure, the physics, the playfulness of iOS that they've built now,
[13:26.480 --> 13:30.720]  I think that's a really long lasting platform. Yeah, and I think it was definitely the intention. And
[13:30.720 --> 13:37.840]  I think part of it is just the simple fact that even with their vast resources now that a lot
[13:37.840 --> 13:43.360]  of the teams that Apple are still relatively small. Johnny Ives group is relatively small and it's
[13:43.360 --> 13:52.160]  always going to be relatively small. And not having to worry about spending specific a lot of time
[13:52.160 --> 14:00.480]  every year updating the look of iOS and macOS 10 and watch OS just to keep them looking fresh,
[14:00.480 --> 14:07.520]  trying to stick to something that's a little bit more timeless. Even if it decreases the sort
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.200]  of trendiness like wow, that looks good again this year. This is new, you know, like you do lose
[14:13.200 --> 14:18.560]  something marketing wise if there's not like wow, that looks new every year. But it saves them the
[14:18.560 --> 14:23.120]  time of having to just keep reinventing this stuff. They're already they've already done and let
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.120]  them spend times on expanding like last year, they could expand and spend a lot of time on the watch
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.720]  this year. They could spend a lot of time on Apple TV. Yeah, no, absolutely. And the interesting thing
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.120]  is that that was a painful moment. That took a huge amount of willpower and a huge amount of effort
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.960]  and they turned that around in less than even a year. And then they did another massive
[14:43.680 --> 14:49.920]  change with iOS 8 and built out all the new frameworks. But now that's done and they can do things
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.720]  that are super interesting. And I think you need those moments. You need those moments of this is what
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.720]  we thought the platform was going to be. And six years, seven years later, this is what we
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.120]  understand that is now and if we want to go 10 years forward, we need to build that out now because
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.200]  it's only going to get harder as we move on. And they can do a gold phone or a rose gold
[15:07.200 --> 15:11.280]  phone and that will appeal to people who just want a new color. But the software inside it,
[15:11.280 --> 15:16.880]  you know, yes, you know, maybe the wallpaper will match the rose gold or the gold or the new sport
[15:16.880 --> 15:21.120]  bands, whatever. But the software itself will scale through all of that. Yeah, I mean, I know that
[15:21.120 --> 15:27.280]  this is in a lot of ways a problematic analogy. But if you just compare it to a pane of coat on a
[15:27.280 --> 15:33.680]  building, um, I think for the first few years of iOS, Apple was sort of not necessarily picking,
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.920]  it wasn't like radically changing every year, but they were going back and having to repaint a lot
[15:37.920 --> 15:44.080]  of the building every year. And I think with the iOS 7 look is, is like a longer lasting coat of
[15:44.080 --> 15:49.840]  paint. And then they can just go back and update some of the trim, you know, and so, okay, now it's
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.360]  not Helvetica Noya. It's San Francisco is the system font, but the whole thing didn't have to get
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.480]  repainted. It feels almost like they switched from doing iOS as a bit map and made it a vector.
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.800]  Yeah. Yeah, sort of, I think that's a very good way of putting it. And I think that fitting it in
[16:06.800 --> 16:13.520]  with the size classes is part of that too. I think that pixel perfect stuff. Um, I was, you know, and
[16:13.520 --> 16:18.480]  I really do hope over there. I'm a fan of this design. I think it was the right thing. I know
[16:18.480 --> 16:23.360]  there's still people who still complain about it. Um, but it doesn't mean that I've suddenly
[16:23.360 --> 16:29.040]  dropped it and think that the old iOS look was bad. I mean, there's certain aspects of it that
[16:29.040 --> 16:36.400]  I miss, but, um, it just, I don't think it gave them the flexibility that they need. And we can
[16:36.400 --> 16:41.760]  subjectively like or dislike individual elements of the latest iOS or iOS 6 or 5, but objectively,
[16:41.760 --> 16:48.000]  there were huge gains that were made by going this direction. Yeah. Um, let's take a break,
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.600]  and then when we come back, let's talk about the event last week. Um, maybe not spend too much time
[16:53.600 --> 16:59.040]  on it, but then we'll go on to iOS 9, but let me take a break and thank our first sponsor this week,
[16:59.040 --> 17:06.560]  and it is our good friends at hover. You guys know, however, they're the best place to buy and manage
[17:06.560 --> 17:12.240]  domain names. Uh, when you have a great idea, you want to secure a great domain for it. You want
[17:12.240 --> 17:17.920]  something catchy and memorable, uh, to represent your project. Uh, you want a domain name that
[17:17.920 --> 17:21.760]  looks good. Like a lot of times you think you have it, you know, the word you want and you find
[17:21.760 --> 17:26.160]  another top, you know, the top of a domain to put to put next to it. But then when you look at it,
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.720]  sometimes certain letters don't look right next to each other. Or if you make it all lower case,
[17:30.720 --> 17:36.240]  certain words combine together and just don't look right together because it looks like it might
[17:36.240 --> 17:39.520]  spell a different word or something like that. It's hard to get a good domain. You have to play around
[17:39.520 --> 17:47.840]  with it. Hover makes that easy. They've got great tools to find new domains. Uh, when you find one
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.440]  that you want and it's taken, maybe if it's the dot com, it's a very good chance it's taken. They
[17:53.440 --> 18:00.160]  help you find another top level domain with the same root word. Um, all of that. Unless some five
[18:00.160 --> 18:04.800]  minutes, even if you haven't ever even opened your hover account yet with five minutes, you can
[18:04.800 --> 18:09.600]  find a domain, register it, get it up and running and all you have to do is search for a few
[18:09.600 --> 18:15.680]  keywords to get it going. Um, and they'll show you all of the results against all the extensions
[18:15.680 --> 18:20.320]  out there. If you've ever registered a domain anywhere else, you know that a lot of the companies
[18:20.320 --> 18:25.440]  in the domain registration business make it purposefully unpleasant. It's a, it's a real scammy
[18:25.440 --> 18:30.320]  business. There's, there's, it's, it's a race to the bottom pricing wise for the most part and
[18:30.320 --> 18:38.880]  therefore to make up for it. They do a lot of, uh, just like upsell stuff to, to get the extra
[18:38.880 --> 18:44.480]  money out of you. Uh, hover goes the other way. They do have great prices. They're not the lowest,
[18:44.480 --> 18:48.400]  but they shouldn't be the lowest because they, what they do, they're, they're competitive and I
[18:48.400 --> 18:53.360]  think it's well worth the value. But what they do is they just include all the stuff that you
[18:53.360 --> 18:59.680]  don't have to upgrade for a great example is who is privacy. Um, so that when people look up your
[18:59.680 --> 19:04.880]  domain name, uh, can they see your home address and phone number? Well, everybody knows you don't
[19:04.880 --> 19:10.000]  want that up there and who is stuff. Um, but other, other registars make you pay for it. Well, that's
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.240]  ridiculous. Obviously that should be included in your account. Hover makes that so. And last but not
[19:16.240 --> 19:20.800]  least, in fact, last but most important, hover has the most amazing thing in the entire business.
[19:20.800 --> 19:25.440]  They call it free valet transfer service. So if you've already got domain names at another
[19:25.440 --> 19:30.960]  registrar and you want to move them to hover, which you should, what you can do instead of doing
[19:30.960 --> 19:37.120]  all that busy work yourself is just sign up for a hover account. Go to the valet transfer,
[19:37.120 --> 19:43.120]  give them your, uh, the information did log into your registrar at the other places. And their
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.720]  experts at hover will, will handle everything to move them over. Uh, you don't have to pay for it.
[19:48.720 --> 19:52.720]  That's just included with your hover account. That's just, that's, that's how sure they are that
[19:52.720 --> 19:56.320]  once you switch those domains to hover, they are never going to switch them away. You'll just be a
[19:56.320 --> 20:00.320]  long time customer and they just know they'll make the money from you on the renewals as the
[20:00.320 --> 20:06.000]  years go by. They're that, that confident in it. Um, I have a lot of friends with a lot of domains
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.480]  and a lot of them use hover and I've never heard of one person who's ever switched from hover
[20:10.480 --> 20:16.880]  to another domain. It's that good. So here's the deal. Go to hover.com. They have a code, you'll get
[20:16.880 --> 20:23.040]  10% off your first purchase by using this code. It's just for this episode of this show and they
[20:23.040 --> 20:30.000]  always pick these clever codes. Here it is, crappy old phone and you'll save 10% off your first,
[20:30.000 --> 20:38.720]  uh, purchase a checkout. So my thanks to them hover.com and use the code crappy old phone and anybody
[20:38.720 --> 20:43.280]  listening to this show this week. You've got it. You've got a crappy old phone in your hand.
[20:47.120 --> 20:53.600]  All right. Um, so last week's event, you were there. Yes. We, we sat near each other.
[20:53.600 --> 21:01.200]  Um, I was wrong in advance. I thought, Hey, you know, uh, I think they'll do the same thing they
[21:01.200 --> 21:06.800]  usually do have the two events one after another because it would be busy. Um, and because, you know,
[21:06.800 --> 21:11.600]  they're, otherwise they're not going to be able to talk about the Mac at all. So I was wrong.
[21:12.800 --> 21:17.680]  They only have, they're only having one event this year. I'm almost certain and talking to friends
[21:17.680 --> 21:22.320]  behind the scenes that certainly is the plan. If there is another public event this year, it would be
[21:22.320 --> 21:29.760]  something that the addressing some kind of surprise. Um, but I was right. It made for a very busy
[21:29.760 --> 21:37.280]  event and it left no time at all for the Mac. Yeah, no time for the Mac OS 10 was, uh, it was a
[21:37.280 --> 21:43.040]  Easter egg in Craig's email box. I caught that. It's funny because I take notes and it's funny
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.240]  when I rewatch the event, I never once catch everything. They're too dense, especially when they go
[21:48.240 --> 21:53.040]  fast like this. So I always, there's always some things I caught. I did happen to catch that. So
[21:53.040 --> 22:00.160]  what was it? Craig was up there. Yeah, he was just demoing, um, the email preview abilities, the
[22:00.160 --> 22:06.160]  hint peak and pop for 3D touch. And he did the preview on Phil Schiller's email and it had secret
[22:06.160 --> 22:11.360]  release date for OS 10, El Capitons of 10, or 30, if they'll let anybody find out. Yeah. And then
[22:11.360 --> 22:18.160]  I think it said the bottom, uh, note Apple confidential. Yeah. Uh, that was about it for the Mac though.
[22:18.160 --> 22:26.800]  Um, in hindsight, I guess it makes sense. And especially if they don't have new Mac hardware
[22:26.800 --> 22:32.000]  ready to go later this year, although I think if they do, and it's just retin a 21-time Mac
[22:32.000 --> 22:38.000]  and minor refreshes to, to MacBook Pros or something, they can just do those with a press release.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.800]  Yeah, the MacBook shipped in March, what was announced in March and Intel took so long to get
[22:42.800 --> 22:47.120]  broad well out. And now they're just be getting to roll out Skylake that it's hard, it's hard to
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.960]  see that they have the chips to make the sort of MacBooks that they would want to show off on a stage.
[22:50.960 --> 22:57.520]  Yeah. And, you know, otherwise there's not much left front event. Uh, I forget what other, a few
[22:57.520 --> 23:04.240]  other readers have, you know, sent in as speculation. Yeah, more like routers. Yeah, I was
[23:04.240 --> 23:09.040]  I forget what somebody else. Uh, it's just not possible. There's no way that they can make an event
[23:09.040 --> 23:16.400]  that's worth it. Would it have been worth it to have a separate event? Now, if they had held the iPads,
[23:16.400 --> 23:20.400]  including the iPad Pro, I think they could have done it, because the, and then what they could have
[23:20.400 --> 23:25.920]  done, I guess, although in high, you know, maybe not. See, I was thinking because the, there's a new iPad
[23:25.920 --> 23:33.600]  mini four, which is now technically equivalent to the iPad Air 2. Um, that's my processor difference,
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.280]  but that's about it. Uh, that's interesting. And that's a new machine actually does kind of make
[23:39.280 --> 23:45.120]  for a hard demo though. If once you've shown off all the features in the new OS on the iPad Pro,
[23:45.680 --> 23:50.960]  so maybe it doesn't make for a good event. Maybe part of it, you know, part of it, obviously,
[23:50.960 --> 23:54.880]  I think talking to people behind the scenes was that Apple really wanted to only have one event
[23:54.880 --> 24:01.360]  because doing one event and putting all of the wood behind that arrow is easier than doing two
[24:01.360 --> 24:06.560]  events, even if one of them is sort of a smaller one right there on Apple's campus. But second,
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.400]  maybe that wouldn't have been enough to, you know, maybe that would have left people, you know,
[24:10.400 --> 24:15.200]  people who go and travel to get their thinking, this wasn't worth it. And the people who
[24:15.200 --> 24:19.760]  watched from home there, they're watching and they see 4k iMacs not as a processor, 5k iMac,
[24:19.760 --> 24:23.920]  the iPad mini three, it's not as impressive as the iPad, sorry, iPad mini four, not as impressive
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.400]  as the iPad Air 2. And then you have the iPad Pro, which is great, but Apple is usually really good
[24:28.400 --> 24:34.880]  when they have a double barrel event. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's just like last year's
[24:34.880 --> 24:41.200]  retina iMac, except smaller. And it's just like last year's iPad Air 2, but smaller. It isn't
[24:41.200 --> 24:45.920]  really, that's great if what you want is smaller, but it doesn't really make for a demo.
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.400]  I will miss Craig getting up on stage and saying OS 10 is available today,
[24:51.200 --> 24:56.240]  but other than that. Yeah. Yeah. The only thing really they would have left to demo is to rehash.
[24:56.240 --> 25:01.200]  And I think that would be good, but it just, I may not make for a great event is to just go through,
[25:01.200 --> 25:05.280]  here's the top 10 best features, the 10 pole features in Yosemite.
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.200]  Are you going to do that for iOS this year? I mean, iOS didn't get any time.
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.240]  Yeah, they kind of, yeah, again, because they went long enough as is, they kind of skipped that
[25:14.240 --> 25:18.960]  rehash of, you know, what they call the tent poles. And usually it's 10 of them, you know,
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.000]  but here's the top 10 things that we want you to know about.
[25:22.000 --> 25:27.280]  And people forget, I know people sometimes complain about it because they're like, they showed
[25:27.280 --> 25:34.000]  all this a WWE suit. I think, you know, people who are really, really cued into this,
[25:34.000 --> 25:37.520]  I mean, sometimes I get that feeling too when I'm watching it, but I totally understand why
[25:37.520 --> 25:41.360]  Apple does it because that's how you, that's how you teach people things. You have to repeat it.
[25:41.360 --> 25:48.240]  It's, it's both a pedagogical axiom and a marketing axiom. You have to make your point multiple
[25:48.240 --> 25:53.920]  times to get it through to more people, you know, than you will see.
[25:53.920 --> 25:58.720]  Absolutely. And it's not like Apple talks to us very often, us being the greater community.
[25:58.720 --> 26:01.760]  They just don't have a lot of airtime. So when they have that airtime, they want to do that
[26:01.760 --> 26:04.960]  exactly. Here's what we're going to tell you. We're telling it to you. Did you see what we told you?
[26:08.560 --> 26:16.320]  The event itself was if I had known if I had somehow gotten advanced access inside the
[26:16.320 --> 26:22.400]  facility and seen what they had built, I would have been a lot less likely to guess that they
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.880]  were going to do two events this year. Yeah. Like it's hard for me to, you know, in my right up
[26:26.880 --> 26:32.160]  afterwards, I don't think I had so much to cover, but it's, it's really hard for me to express
[26:32.160 --> 26:38.720]  just how impressive the build out inside that the, the bill Graham Civic Center was.
[26:39.440 --> 26:43.120]  Yeah. If you'd never seen the Civic Center without it, you would, like I had never seen it before.
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.400]  I didn't know what it looked like. So I went and looked at some other pictures afterwards. And
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.680]  if you'd only ever seen it without what Apple did do it, you may not appreciate it. But they
[26:49.680 --> 26:53.600]  transformed that structure. It's almost like a movie set when you come into an empty warehouse
[26:53.600 --> 26:58.720]  and all of a sudden it's, it's the force awakens inside it. Yeah, it's, that's a good way to put it
[26:58.720 --> 27:03.920]  that it's, it was like a movie set. Like they built a movie set for an Apple keynote room.
[27:03.920 --> 27:07.600]  Like I was saying that they built a building within the building and then maybe that's not right
[27:07.600 --> 27:13.360]  because it was all, it didn't have an outside structure for you to see it, it was all inside. So a
[27:13.360 --> 27:19.360]  movie set is maybe a better way to put it because it was all meant to be seen from the inside,
[27:19.360 --> 27:23.360]  like a movie set. And the outside who knows what it looked like, you know, it was impossible to sort
[27:23.360 --> 27:28.560]  of see that that and from one direction. I mean, it's people kept saying 7,000 seats, but they had
[27:28.560 --> 27:35.280]  maybe 1,500 1700 available in there. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was it because it's, you know,
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.560]  that they took up a bunch of that what would be the floor space for like if you wanted to hold a
[27:40.560 --> 27:45.360]  concert or something with max, you know, and sell the most tickets, you would just set it up
[27:45.360 --> 27:50.320]  an entirely different way. I mean, it really was more like a movie set 360 degrees all the way around,
[27:51.280 --> 27:59.280]  even the flooring, you know, the stadium seating that we sat on was all built by Apple and
[27:59.280 --> 28:03.680]  and temporary. Yeah, it's not like they have a big warehouse in Cupertino that they
[28:03.680 --> 28:07.280]  cart the stuff in and then put it away again for next year's event. They built this stuff,
[28:07.280 --> 28:14.240]  they build it like bespoke every time. Yeah, they even put in an air system. So the building is
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.720]  not air conditioned. And I was talking to somebody at Apple and when they were talking, you know,
[28:18.720 --> 28:22.560]  in preliminary talks to maybe use this building, they were like, well, what's the air conditioning
[28:22.560 --> 28:29.120]  situation? And the build grand people were like, oh, it's easy. It's great. You just open the windows.
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.440]  Yeah. No, their events team is spectacular. They really could run production for any
[28:33.440 --> 28:40.400]  major studio. It's I just think about this. What do you think that cost them? Oh, man. I mean,
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.400]  just the air conditioning. And we were actually joking at the event that we'd rather the Wi-Fi went
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.400]  out than the air conditioning because it was so hot. Yeah, but it must have been in the millions,
[28:48.400 --> 28:56.960]  you know, I can't believe how high. I'm not in that field. So I could be way off. I'm guessing
[28:56.960 --> 29:01.040]  10 to 15 million dollars. Doesn't sound crazy to me. Well, and think about it. Like what's a
[29:01.040 --> 29:07.120]  Super Bowl ad cost? Yeah, like five million dollars and plus the production costs to make the
[29:07.120 --> 29:12.240]  commercial. So, you know, it's not unheard of for a company to spend 10 to 20 million dollars on a
[29:12.240 --> 29:19.120]  TV campaign or commercial. And Apple certainly gets super, you know, I, well, they get more than
[29:19.120 --> 29:25.440]  Super Bowl commercial exposure out of these special events. And unlike a commercial has to be
[29:25.440 --> 29:29.280]  done live, they have to get it right the first time. Right. But they don't have to share the day
[29:29.280 --> 29:34.800]  with anybody else. So instead of racing to, you know, have being one of 40 different all trying to
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.960]  be the, you know, the commercial everybody's talking about tomorrow. Apple knows everybody's
[29:38.960 --> 29:43.760]  going to be talking about them tomorrow. But I think spending 10, 20 million dollars on it is not
[29:43.760 --> 29:47.600]  outlandish. And I think it looked like something that might have spent 10, 20 million dollars on,
[29:47.600 --> 29:53.200]  you know, however long they'd rented the place out, however many people it took to build it,
[29:53.200 --> 30:00.160]  however much a cost to put all that stuff up. I mean, the seats, again, I wrote this that I think
[30:00.160 --> 30:03.440]  that they just, I don't know if they threw them out. I don't know if there was someone they could
[30:03.440 --> 30:09.040]  donate them to. But the seating was that we sat in was all brand new. I mean, and I don't know
[30:09.040 --> 30:15.440]  that there's a way to rent that. Like it wasn't, they weren't chairs that you can like pick up
[30:15.440 --> 30:19.840]  and move. They were like rows of seating that were connected to each other. You know, there's certain
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.960]  types of folding chairs that that you can latch next to each other for for ad hoc events that you
[30:24.960 --> 30:28.640]  can take them down and stuff like that. I didn't look like condo association seating at use that last
[30:28.640 --> 30:33.600]  week. Right. And they all looked the ones I was in. Look, you know, our section that they all look
[30:33.600 --> 30:38.080]  brand new. But on the other hand, and some people, you know, when I wrote that, they were like,
[30:38.080 --> 30:43.120]  well, maybe they're going to use those on the campus in their theater. And that's a good idea,
[30:43.120 --> 30:48.400]  but they weren't that sturdy. They, they were, they, you know, there was a lot of rock to them.
[30:48.400 --> 30:54.480]  I mean, they were nice. And they were cushioned. Um, but they, uh, I'd be shocked if those exact
[30:54.480 --> 30:58.880]  seats were the ones Apple has in their new theater on campus because they weren't that nice.
[30:58.880 --> 31:03.520]  They didn't look Johnny I've teamed design. No, they definitely did not. And they also did not
[31:03.520 --> 31:10.320]  feel built to last. Yeah, they, you know, but they were, you know, it just, it was just an
[31:10.320 --> 31:14.160]  unbelievable. And the crazy thing is it wasn't just that. Like if you ever go to CES and talked
[31:14.160 --> 31:18.560]  about how much those booths cost, they built the equivalent, like they had pods for the Apple TV
[31:18.560 --> 31:22.880]  demos, little living rooms. And I don't know how many it looks like 10 or 20. And those are all
[31:22.880 --> 31:28.080]  like, that's the CES style pavilion as well as the event they're already running. Yeah,
[31:28.080 --> 31:34.000]  absolutely. Um, the screen was enormous. The stage and screen were enormous. And that's the sort
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.320]  of thing that's really, I think it's impossible to gauge if you're not there. Like the, you know,
[31:38.320 --> 31:42.720]  and again, does it really matter that we were there, message-wise, no, but in terms of understanding
[31:42.720 --> 31:48.080]  the scale of the, the, the show, it does. Because when you're on TV, you know, watching the video,
[31:48.080 --> 31:53.840]  it, it reduces that scale. You're really just watching the slides go by. Um, and you don't really
[31:53.840 --> 31:59.120]  see the size of it. It was enormous. It was so big that I noticed several times that when they were
[31:59.120 --> 32:05.120]  switching to videos and they're like, you know, like when one of the Johnny IMS narrated videos that
[32:05.120 --> 32:11.520]  that the, the whoever was speaking, um, Phil or Tim or whoever would say, you know, now we have,
[32:11.520 --> 32:15.040]  you know, I'll tell you about it. They'd start playing it while they were still standing in front
[32:15.040 --> 32:20.720]  of it because it was so big that it would create an awkward pause if they waited until they walked
[32:20.720 --> 32:25.360]  until they weren't in front of it anymore. It was, it was almost like an IMAX version of a,
[32:25.360 --> 32:30.160]  of a tech demo. Yeah. Like ordinarily, you would never, never. And I, and I think it had to come
[32:30.160 --> 32:36.240]  through rehearsals. I think even like your instincts, even as, you know, not that polished of a
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.400]  public speaker, you, you would, it would occur to you. I'm going to hit the button to play this
[32:40.400 --> 32:44.880]  after I'm off to the side, but it was so big that they had to do it while they were sort of standing
[32:44.880 --> 32:48.800]  in front of it. And because it was so big, it did, they never, at least I didn't even notice anybody
[32:48.800 --> 32:56.720]  once the video played, they were so small in comparison. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, definitely, definitely. And I
[32:56.720 --> 32:59.760]  even thought that too while I was watching it that it didn't make that big a difference because
[32:59.760 --> 33:04.960]  you really just sort of saw, you know, little tiny bit of their silhouette, um, instead of the screen,
[33:04.960 --> 33:11.840]  it was really, truly enormous screen. Um, good sound, really good sound. And again, that's a big
[33:11.840 --> 33:15.200]  build out because they weren't, it wasn't like there was a sound system in there that they used,
[33:15.200 --> 33:20.640]  they put one in. They put like a couple of those new iPad pro speakers just in each corner.
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.160]  Turn them to max. Um, and then the other thing, in addition to those, those cubicles they built,
[33:28.160 --> 33:34.720]  it was like, it was like a off to stage left was where they had all of these little living rooms
[33:34.720 --> 33:43.680]  to test Apple TV. And, uh, iPad pro demos that were hosted by like talented artists. Yes, that,
[33:43.680 --> 33:47.760]  you know, who already had exposure to the thing and could show you what somebody who knows what
[33:47.760 --> 33:53.280]  the hell they're doing when they're drawing can do. Um, and they were really nice, but it was
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.320]  real dark over there. And then stage right, you went down a hallway and it was like you were entering
[33:58.320 --> 34:03.680]  a temporary Apple store. And the most amazing thing is as you came down that hallway, it looked
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.160]  like it was flooded with sunlight. Did you notice that? Yeah, I didn't, actually, I didn't pick
[34:08.160 --> 34:11.600]  up that it was sunlight, but there was almost like a golden glow coming in as you walked through the
[34:11.600 --> 34:16.880]  room. I, I was waiting to get in and I look and it was flooded with sunlight and I thought the
[34:16.880 --> 34:20.640]  one time, remember at one time Apple cut a hole in the wall at the airplane, a sweater to
[34:20.640 --> 34:24.560]  center to get sunlight in there. And I thought, oh, they must have cut a hole in the roof. And
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.120]  then I thought, no, wait, that doesn't make any sense because the Bill Graham Center has like
[34:29.120 --> 34:35.360]  three floors above above the floor they were on. Um, and it just they put in like some kind of,
[34:35.360 --> 34:42.720]  you know, fancy lighting system that gives off light in the color temperature of, um, of sunlight.
[34:42.720 --> 34:46.560]  You guys wonder if that was home kit. There's just some guy there with Siri controlling all of it.
[34:46.560 --> 34:52.640]  I don't know. But again, I think it's sort of like a movie, you know, movie studio quality lighting. Absolutely.
[34:52.640 --> 34:58.640]  Like the sort of thing that a TV show or a movie would use to simulate, you know, sunlight
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.760]  without having to, you know, actually have sunlight in a, again, that's all of them. They don't
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.280]  have an external events team. Like some people do like they don't hire anyone to put this together
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.600]  for them. It's all internal. Yeah. And it's a, you know, incredibly impressive. You know, I don't
[35:13.600 --> 35:17.840]  know. I thought so. Very completely. The other thing that was interesting and you and I talked about
[35:17.840 --> 35:24.640]  this is even with the seating for 1400, they did not greatly expand. In fact, I think they might have
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.560]  contracted the number of, uh, media and analysts who were invited. In other words, outsiders, non
[35:30.560 --> 35:34.080]  Apple people who were invited to the event. So I heard, and I don't, I didn't hear anything
[35:34.080 --> 35:38.400]  official, but I heard that the constraint wasn't the seating of the arena, but the capacity of the
[35:38.400 --> 35:45.040]  on hands area that you just couldn't have that many people in the Apple TV and the iPad, uh,
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.200]  testing areas at one time. And that limited how many, because you can't just have a bunch of
[35:49.200 --> 35:52.880]  media people there and just never let them in. So they had to figure out that number. Then that's
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.040]  as many presses they could invite. And then the rest they used for engineers. Yeah, that actually,
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.880]  I did not hear that, but that makes my experience, my firsthand experience make that makes total
[36:02.880 --> 36:11.120]  sense to me. Um, because I stayed until they also politely asked like those of us remaining to leave.
[36:12.160 --> 36:18.400]  And in the old days, that trick used to get you some really good hands-on time with stuff. I remember
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.200]  like when the, I remember very specifically, and it's just funny because, you know, Apple's back
[36:23.200 --> 36:30.160]  to having a keyboard you can latch onto an iPad. Um, the first iPad, it was so hard to get time with
[36:30.160 --> 36:34.400]  them. And, you know, you really just felt like there's so many people waiting at every table
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.160]  that after you did get some time and got to play with some things that it would occur to you.
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.920]  It was so many people you just felt like a jerk if you didn't hand it back over to the Apple
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.160]  rep and, you know, go take, you know, get in line again somewhere else or think about new things to do.
[36:46.160 --> 36:52.240]  But by the end of that hands-on session, Dan Morin and I had an iPad with the hardware, the
[36:52.240 --> 36:58.080]  original hardware keyboard thing to ourselves for, oh, I don't know, like a good like 15 uninterrupted
[36:58.080 --> 37:03.120]  minutes. And, you know, we got to play with as many things as we could. Test out keyboard shortcuts
[37:03.120 --> 37:08.000]  and, you know, it was fantastic. And there was nobody over our shoulder because most people left.
[37:08.000 --> 37:14.720]  That's not the case anymore. Like it was crowded and hard to get time with stuff right up until
[37:14.720 --> 37:20.320]  they asked us to leave. Yeah, no, absolutely. And that's with just the people they didn't fight,
[37:20.320 --> 37:26.240]  so. And I heard also that they tried to have much more international balance in the media
[37:26.240 --> 37:29.680]  presence this time as well. And when you look through the media, it was obvious that there were
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.920]  people from Europe, Asia, everywhere. Yeah, a lot of people from Europe clearly and a lot of
[37:35.920 --> 37:43.440]  people from Asia clearly. Yeah. And the story I heard about that was that for years what they used
[37:43.440 --> 37:47.440]  to do is run simulcasts around the world. I don't know how many, but let's say they'd have one
[37:47.440 --> 37:54.240]  in London and they'd have one somewhere in Asia, maybe more than those two, maybe more. But, you know,
[37:54.240 --> 38:02.240]  at least, you know, one in Asia and one in London. And that way people wouldn't have to fly as far.
[38:02.240 --> 38:08.240]  Someone from Germany would only have to travel to London. And Apple has PR staff in those, you know,
[38:08.240 --> 38:15.360]  on those continents already. And that PR staff could man those events. But they were all here this year.
[38:15.360 --> 38:19.200]  Yeah, well, just of what I heard is that more and more that people from around the world,
[38:19.200 --> 38:25.200]  even with the expense and time of traveling, wanted to be at the real show. They didn't want to watch
[38:25.200 --> 38:30.480]  on a screen at the same time. They wanted to be at the show. And as more and more people were,
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.600]  you know, those media people were asking for that left less and less reason for them to
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.400]  simulcast it. And so they didn't anybody who wanted to be there was here. But that meant, though,
[38:40.400 --> 38:46.160]  that, you know, the 400 spots for outsiders had to be split from everybody around the world.
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.320]  Yeah. And conversely, they had so many products. They had the all new Apple Watch stuff. They had
[38:50.320 --> 38:54.400]  the iPad. They had the Apple TV. They had the iPhones. And those, those teams aren't big, like the
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.520]  press teams, the marketing teams. As far as I could tell, there were people, they were being manned by
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.560]  people from all over the world like that. If you worked at Apple and those departments anywhere in
[39:02.560 --> 39:09.600]  the world, you were there helping out that day. Yeah, definitely. Um, just wild. It's just an
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.920]  incredible, incredible effort that goes into it. Whatever you think of the announcements. I mean,
[39:13.920 --> 39:21.520]  just the meta commentary on the effort Apple puts into the show itself is it's truly extraordinary.
[39:21.520 --> 39:26.320]  And it's, they've taken it to, to a level with this show. I think that they've never done before.
[39:26.320 --> 39:29.520]  Yeah. It's almost like, uh, I don't know you mentioned before that the idea that Apple was a
[39:29.520 --> 39:33.680]  product, but it's almost like the events themselves have become products. And I've gotten to go to
[39:33.680 --> 39:37.840]  shows by other companies. Uh, and when you see the difference in how they're staged, like,
[39:37.840 --> 39:41.120]  I won't mention any names, but some of them don't even think about streaming it. They just
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.320]  doesn't occur to them as they're setting it up. And then there's massive problems at the last
[39:44.320 --> 39:50.000]  minute, or they do simulcast and one starts before the other. And then I remember one year, uh,
[39:50.000 --> 39:53.520]  I forget London, New York started early. So these, they started handing out phones to keep reporters
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.440]  busy, uh, while they were trying to get the satellite back and those reporters sort of blocking
[39:57.440 --> 40:01.360]  the phones immediately. Like there's just so many of the things that could go wrong and that,
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.840]  and that these tend to go right as a testament to the effort put in. Yeah. And it seems like,
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.480]  you know, the streaming held up once again very well for everybody out, you know, at home,
[40:10.480 --> 40:14.000]  everybody out there listening. I bet, you know, probably a majority of the people listening to
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.560]  this episode probably listen live. And it seemed like there were very few, if any, complaints
[40:18.560 --> 40:22.720]  about the streaming. Yeah. I mean, accidents and bad things happened to everybody. And I think it's
[40:22.720 --> 40:26.720]  a testament to a company that they often do not let the same bad thing or the same mistakes happen
[40:26.720 --> 40:32.720]  twice. Right. Nobody got switched to the Chinese audio track or something like that. No. Um,
[40:33.840 --> 40:38.960]  anything else you want to talk about from the, from the event? Yeah. It was interesting to me is when
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.720]  we talked to a bunch of our friends about it, uh, how split some of the opinions are. And I know
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.720]  there was a little bit of that at WWDC because some people actually did like the music stuff,
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.800]  a lot of us didn't, but some people did. And this year there was nothing as divisive as that,
[40:50.800 --> 40:54.720]  but there were still some people, like I know Jeff Williams owns Apple watched it, Apple, it's in
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.440]  his org, but he presented it and it wasn't Phil Shiller. And some people like the fresh new voice,
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.440]  and some people would prefer to have Phil do all those things, and some people don't find Phil
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.520]  excited enough. So they like Craig with some people think Craig is just a bunch of dad jokes. And
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.440]  then like there's just so many opinions now about who should be doing what? And I think that
[41:11.440 --> 41:15.200]  almost shows that they're getting to a level where we're not worrying about their products as
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.760]  much anymore. And we're worrying about Apple as a show. Yeah. It's, I, you know, I don't get the
[41:21.760 --> 41:25.920]  complaints about Shiller. And I know that there's some people who, you know, like Twitter and
[41:25.920 --> 41:31.440]  email are like, what's wrong with Shiller? Was he depressed? You know, I like his demeanor on stage.
[41:31.440 --> 41:39.760]  I think, I think it's very carefully dialed in and it is, it is very much, it's, I don't find
[41:39.760 --> 41:45.440]  it to be lacking in enthusiasm. I find it to be completely without artificial enthusiasm.
[41:45.440 --> 41:52.960]  Absolutely. And, you know, even Federigi who is, who is more enthusiastic, I don't find it to be
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.520]  phony though. I really do think though that that's exactly what he thinks. He's just more of a
[41:57.520 --> 42:03.440]  jovial guy than, than Shiller is. They're all as far as I can tell, and you spend a lot more time
[42:03.440 --> 42:08.480]  than I have, but they come off, off stage the same way they come off on stage. Yes, very much so in
[42:08.480 --> 42:15.920]  my experience, very much so. Um, even Eddie too. Um, it's, you know, he is, he's, you know,
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.320]  you think, man, that guy might be a little goofy. It's a little goofy. It's funny. Like,
[42:20.320 --> 42:26.560]  red side tunes, yes. You wouldn't, you know, and, and the idea, like, when you hear that Steve
[42:26.560 --> 42:35.040]  Jobs and Tim Cook are ferociously scary, uh, negotiators, it's believable. And when you hear it
[42:35.040 --> 42:40.960]  about Eddie based on his on stage demeanor, it does seem hard to imagine. I, you can't, I can't imagine
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.800]  it, but he, you know, he, I think if there's ever any place where he's got like a different demeanor,
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.920]  it's when he's at the negotiating table, it is different, clearly different than his, uh,
[42:51.920 --> 42:56.560]  his stage demeanor and his, you know, if you, if you say, I don't, you know, backstage or
[42:56.560 --> 43:00.000]  something like that must be so disarming because if someone comes in like their Darth Vader,
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.360]  you're preparing yourself for Darth Vader, but if someone comes in as your best friend
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.600]  than all of a sudden, all the oxygen gets sucked out of the room, you're just not ready for that.
[43:07.600 --> 43:14.560]  Right. I saw one complaint. I saw it at an article that somebody wrote about, um, uh, that,
[43:14.560 --> 43:18.480]  that, uh, I didn't, I don't think I linked to it. I almost did not because I agreed with it,
[43:18.480 --> 43:24.160]  but in the spirit of sometimes I like to link to things I disagree with, but that I find worth
[43:24.160 --> 43:30.000]  considering. It's like the rarest thing. It was an article about, uh, that called Apple's event,
[43:30.000 --> 43:35.600]  creepy as hell. Yeah. And one of his complaints was that it was just one guy after another
[43:35.600 --> 43:41.520]  all dressed the same with the exact same, almost the exact same shirt on. And I, I see what he
[43:41.520 --> 43:45.440]  means. We actually commented on it in the show. It almost seems like maybe Apple needs to coordinate
[43:45.440 --> 43:51.600]  that a little bit better. There was, you know, it really was a series of very similar bluish
[43:51.600 --> 43:55.120]  with, you know, muted dark blue button down.
[43:55.120 --> 43:59.680]  Eddie had his product red shirt on. Well, that's the thing. I don't see how you, I see how you can
[43:59.680 --> 44:08.560]  complain. And I see how, uh, Tim and Jeff Williams, uh, and Shiller and a few others had
[44:08.560 --> 44:15.040]  roughly similar shirts on. Um, I don't see though how you write that sentence without at least putting
[44:15.040 --> 44:26.240]  in a parenthetical about Eddie. Like, like Eddie's shirt was so crazily Eddie that it, it, it demanded
[44:26.240 --> 44:30.160]  to be mentioned. If you're going to talk about the shirts of the people on stage, you got it.
[44:30.160 --> 44:36.720]  You really had to mention that. I almost think I get it. This is going in like, uh, um,
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.040]  like, uh, you remember Doc Severance in the guy who was a fan leader on the, the Johnny Carson
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.400]  show that he wore deliberately outlandish costumes and Carson could correct jokes about it. Like,
[44:48.400 --> 44:53.760]  I feel like Eddie's going in that route or he, he, he's just wears, he wears goofy shirts on
[44:53.760 --> 44:57.840]  purpose. It's part of the negotiating. He distracts you with the shirt and then goes in for the kill.
[44:57.840 --> 45:02.080]  Right. Cause he actually didn't have that shirt on before the event, you know, like pre-event
[45:02.080 --> 45:11.040]  apples, uh, senior executives mingle down in front, uh, in front of the stage, um, you know, like in
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.600]  the, you know, half hour, 45 minutes leading up to the event. And, and I saw it, you know,
[45:15.600 --> 45:19.280]  Eddie down there and he was wearing, I don't know what it was. I didn't really take notice,
[45:19.280 --> 45:22.800]  but I certainly would have taken notice if he was wearing that shirt and he wasn't like, so he
[45:22.800 --> 45:28.080]  actually gets into costume backstage, like, to, to come out. I talked about this, but I seriously
[45:28.080 --> 45:32.240]  want to just turn off the internet often after Apple events. I saw a whole thing about how Johnny
[45:32.240 --> 45:36.560]  I've didn't appear physically in the video and it must be something wrong, but we saw him all over
[45:36.560 --> 45:40.880]  the event. He was, he was exactly like Johnny always was. Yes. Exactly. No, he was
[45:40.880 --> 45:46.160]  all over the place afterwards. Um, no, there's nothing. That's stupid. It's the fact that the fact is
[45:46.160 --> 45:53.120]  that they've upped, they've, well, it's, I guess it's a matter of taste whether they've upped
[45:53.120 --> 46:02.480]  the style of those narrated videos, but they have seemingly abandoned the previous, uh, I'm going to
[46:02.480 --> 46:08.880]  call it a format, but you want to call it a style like template, where it's the white background
[46:08.880 --> 46:17.440]  that, that seemingly infinite white universe background. And you'd see the people doing the talking,
[46:18.240 --> 46:24.000]  you know, all, I think they were always on the right side looking to the left if you're looking at
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.360]  the screen. Um, and you know, this like, as though they were film doing a sit down interview and
[46:29.360 --> 46:37.840]  instead now it's a black background and they're darker and it's entirely shots of the products
[46:37.840 --> 46:42.400]  and pure voiceover from Johnny. And just Johnny, there's, I mean, they don't have Dan Reechill,
[46:42.400 --> 46:46.880]  they used to have, um, these have a bunch of people in those ads. They don't have Johnny Saruji,
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.160]  you know, it's entirely a Johnny eye, but you know, it was getting to the point where people were
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.680]  making fake versions of those. And I think once you have your standing alive moment, you've got to
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.480]  move on. Yeah, I think maybe that's part of it. And that, you know, they just got old, you know,
[46:58.480 --> 47:02.320]  uh, what's his name? Big Bob, um, yeah, man, it's a big monster dance field, a purely,
[47:02.320 --> 47:05.280]  purely than them as well. Dan Reechill was in some of them. I mean, they've had several people,
[47:05.280 --> 47:10.960]  they've had, uh, Jaws react and some of them. Yes, definitely. Um, I always like to see a big
[47:10.960 --> 47:17.360]  Bob man's field. He was great. He just seemed so nice. I really, a lot of them, like they,
[47:17.360 --> 47:20.480]  they really do come off the way they come off from those videos. I think they really do enjoy
[47:20.480 --> 47:24.640]  what they're doing. Yes. Well, absolutely. I don't see there's any other reason that they would stick
[47:24.640 --> 47:31.920]  around. No. Um, I'm trying to think anything else with the event. No, just that it was, I mean,
[47:31.920 --> 47:35.200]  we spoke about it briefly before the event and we said if they, if they were going to do all
[47:35.200 --> 47:38.160]  this stuff, they were going to have to yada, yada, a lot of things. And they did, they yada,
[47:38.160 --> 47:41.280]  yada, a lot of things. Yeah, they definitely, they cut a lot of stuff. Like there was apparently
[47:41.280 --> 47:49.280]  a lot more stuff that we just couldn't fit in. Yeah. I heard, no. I'm curious who does that? Um,
[47:49.280 --> 47:55.680]  because previously it was without question, it was Steve Jobs. He was the director of those shows
[47:55.680 --> 48:02.400]  and it was unquestioned. And he had a gift. And, you know, they were easier to put together
[48:02.400 --> 48:10.080]  when he was around because he's gift was such that if you laid out the products that here's
[48:10.080 --> 48:15.680]  the stuff we'd like to announce, here's all of it. Jobs can just look at that table of stuff,
[48:15.680 --> 48:22.800]  whether it's software, you know, hardware, whatever the mix is. And the show just came to his head
[48:22.800 --> 48:29.280]  like the basic structure. What do we do first? What do we do second? What do we do third? What gets
[48:29.280 --> 48:33.120]  cut? And it just came to him. And it's not that they came to him and then they didn't have to
[48:33.120 --> 48:39.760]  rehearse. And, you know, then they'd start rehearsing. And as they're rehearsing, the flaws in the flow,
[48:39.760 --> 48:44.160]  the lulls and everything just came to him. And he would just say, that's, that's too long,
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.440]  that's got to be 30 seconds. And that's it. And nobody, you know, there weren't really arguments
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.280]  over it. It went. And somebody who's maybe stuff, see, the, and the thing that really sticks out to
[48:55.280 --> 49:01.440]  me when you watch other companies events is that the inner company politics just comes spewing
[49:01.440 --> 49:08.480]  out the sides of the event in terms of you can just see that it's this division and that division
[49:08.480 --> 49:14.000]  and they both want time on the stage. And they want it for the sake of their own internal
[49:14.000 --> 49:26.640]  bureaucratic status, not whether giving equal time or 10 minutes of time to this other thing is
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.960]  good for the flow of the show. And therefore, therefore best for the, for the interest of the
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.120]  company as a whole in terms of keeping people's interest in making sure that the limited time of
[49:35.120 --> 49:41.600]  this event is allocated properly. And I think, you know, Steve Jobs could single-handedly solve that
[49:41.600 --> 49:46.960]  because whoever, whatever internal quabbles there were in turf wars under him, the buck stopped
[49:46.960 --> 49:52.160]  with him and he could stop it. Tim Cook obviously has that authority. And I think it would be
[49:52.160 --> 49:57.040]  unquestioned. But he doesn't have, I don't think he's the guy who has the sense of showmanship to
[49:57.040 --> 50:02.640]  know, you know, which stuff to put in which order and stuff like that. And I really do think
[50:02.640 --> 50:08.320]  that's what was wrong with the WWDC, you know, is that it was just sort of a jumble and sort of
[50:08.320 --> 50:13.520]  randomly structured as opposed to ordered in a way that was harmonious. Yeah, to your point, like,
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.040]  I felt like Steve Jobs could look at one of those weird, you know, those weird paintings and just
[50:17.040 --> 50:20.720]  see the pattern that was hidden inside it would just pop out. I mean, you'd wonder why no else could
[50:20.720 --> 50:25.840]  see it. It's a lobbyist. And now, Tim Cook seems to treat them. We're before it was Steve Jobs
[50:25.840 --> 50:29.360]  and Johnny Ivan, everything radiating out from there. Tim Cook seems to treat them as if they're
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.680]  running their own sub companies in a way. And it feels like, you know, Jess running watch,
[50:33.680 --> 50:37.760]  who does Jeff want to present the watch if he wants to. That's fine. If not, we'll find somebody
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.560]  at he's going to do the iTunes or segment if he doesn't want to do parts of it who's going to do
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.680]  those and they get to make those decisions. And maybe arguably you'd want Tim Cook or Johnny
[50:47.680 --> 50:51.520]  and I have to make some of those decisions, but he seems content to allow them to own those fields.
[50:51.520 --> 50:56.800]  Yeah, but not if he doesn't, if he'd, I think one of the, I think one of the seemingly amazing things
[50:56.800 --> 51:04.240]  about Tim Cook is that he seems extraordinarily comfortable sticking to what he's good at and
[51:04.240 --> 51:09.920]  knowing what he's good at. And he's clearly very, very good at certain things. And then not,
[51:09.920 --> 51:16.640]  not feeling the least bit defensive or inadequate about the things that he's not good at,
[51:17.280 --> 51:22.880]  even though those are some amazing things that his immediate predecessor was amazingly good at.
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.560]  Like it, I don't think it bothers Tim Cook in the least that he's not, he doesn't have that
[51:28.560 --> 51:32.400]  sense of showmanship that Steve Jobs had. And he clearly did a very different apple.
[51:32.400 --> 51:35.920]  Yeah, and clearly it doesn't bother him in the least that he doesn't have the sense of design
[51:35.920 --> 51:41.280]  that Steve Jobs had. I mean, I'm sure Tim Cook offers feedback and he's very, very tuned
[51:41.280 --> 51:45.280]  into the development of these products. And I think if he does have an opinion or question,
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.200]  I don't think I'm sure he doesn't hesitate to ask, but he doesn't have any problem
[51:49.200 --> 51:55.600]  letting Johnny I've take over as the, the buck stops here, sense of design for the company.
[51:55.600 --> 51:59.840]  One of my favorite moments during the event was Tim Cook walked into the Apple TV area with one
[51:59.840 --> 52:04.720]  republic and he wanted to show them an iPad or they were asking about the iPad pro and it wasn't
[52:04.720 --> 52:08.800]  in that area, but there were a group of people, some of the guides there had them. So one of
[52:08.800 --> 52:12.720]  the guides offered it to him and he just picked it up and started giving a complete hands-on demo
[52:12.720 --> 52:16.640]  to one republic showing them the features. Almost like he was working at an Apple store, it was
[52:16.640 --> 52:22.720]  remarkable. Yeah, I was nearby. I actually saw that until they wandered off, but it's
[52:22.720 --> 52:31.680]  his knowledge of what's being announced is as deep as it could be. Like, you know, if he needed
[52:31.680 --> 52:34.720]  to, he could do everything. I mean, it would take forever because he talks so slow, but
[52:35.600 --> 52:38.880]  well, it seems like he doesn't drive design the way Steve Jobs did, but he really does appreciate
[52:38.880 --> 52:43.840]  the details of what they do. Yeah, or and he pays attention to what they do. He is very much
[52:43.840 --> 52:50.240]  aware of it. Like there's, there's no glossing over on that on that stuff. Event wise though,
[52:50.240 --> 52:54.320]  I probably wraps it up. All right, I'll take another break here and let me talk about our next
[52:54.320 --> 53:03.280]  sponsor and it is our very good friends at Backplace. Backplace does online backup for your Mac or
[53:03.280 --> 53:12.160]  your PC. They've got PC. I've heard. I don't know. But more or less what you do is you install
[53:12.160 --> 53:22.320]  Backplace on your Mac or your PC. I guess. And you get a free demo, risk free, no credit card,
[53:23.440 --> 53:29.920]  turn it on, sign up, and it just starts uploading everything on your computer to backplaces
[53:29.920 --> 53:35.600]  online storage. Everything. You have an external hard drive back set up too. All but it's, you know,
[53:35.600 --> 53:43.440]  three terabytes. Nope, they'll back it up. There's no magic to it. Like whatever your upstream
[53:43.440 --> 53:49.280]  internet connection is from your home or your office to the internet is going to limit how long
[53:49.280 --> 53:55.040]  that initial backup takes. There's, they don't have any kind of magic involved that's going to get
[53:55.040 --> 54:01.920]  two terabytes uploaded in an hour. So it might take a while. It might take days. But they know that
[54:01.920 --> 54:07.120]  and it's like engineered with that in mind. And the other thing they do too is they don't just
[54:07.120 --> 54:12.640]  blindly take all of your upstream bandwidth. It's not like your computer is, honestly, I've done it.
[54:12.640 --> 54:18.400]  I've just reinstalled it on a couple of new machines within the last few months and gone through
[54:18.400 --> 54:24.480]  the first run of using Backplace. You don't notice that it's running. You don't notice that it's
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.920]  doing the initial backup. It's not like, you know, all of a sudden everything else on your
[54:27.920 --> 54:34.480]  computer is slow. It just works. It's worked and it's written by people who use it and know what
[54:34.480 --> 54:40.880]  it's meant for. Anyway, once everything's uploaded and there and you have a complete backup,
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.840]  it just silently runs in the background and slowly, you know, as you make changes and add stuff,
[54:45.840 --> 54:54.880]  just keeps it up to date. It is a remarkable, remarkable service. And it's just an unbelievable price.
[54:54.880 --> 54:59.040]  There are no add-ons. There's no gimmicks. There's no additional charges. It's not like you get
[54:59.040 --> 55:05.200]  a terabyte free and then you have to pay for more or whatever. You just pay $5 per month per
[55:05.200 --> 55:12.240]  computer and you get unlimited, unthrottle backup. It's just unbelievable. When you want to get
[55:12.240 --> 55:16.320]  files back, what do you do? You can just log in. If you just need one file, maybe you're, you know,
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.880]  on your iPhone, you can use their app and just get access to one file from your Mac, from anywhere
[55:20.880 --> 55:28.000]  you are in the world and then email it or do whatever you want with it. 25% of all of the
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.640]  restores from blackblaze customers are just one file at a time. But if you need everything back,
[55:34.640 --> 55:40.480]  you can order a USB hard drive and it'll just show up, you know, by overnight with everything on it.
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.480]  Can't be better. So stop putting it off. You'll feel, if you're not backing up offline,
[55:46.480 --> 55:50.800]  even if you have backups right there in your, in your office, in your house, local backups to
[55:50.800 --> 55:57.040]  another hard drive, which is great. I do too. Just, just, you'll feel so much better with an
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.800]  off-site backup too. You can't, you can't back up to enough different places. And if you want to
[56:00.800 --> 56:05.840]  get a backup that's in the cloud, off-site, I can't recommend anything better than backblaze.
[56:05.840 --> 56:12.080]  Go to backblaze.com slash the talk show and they'll know that you came from the show
[56:12.080 --> 56:18.320]  and check them out. Install it now. Don't, don't put it off really. Just pause, pause this podcast
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.840]  and go get started. Install it, get it started. It'll take you like five minutes and then come
[56:23.840 --> 56:31.600]  back and listen to the rest of the show. All right. So I guess we can talk about what they
[56:31.600 --> 56:38.480]  announced at the show. I'm curious what you think of the iPad Pro with the pen because you are
[56:38.480 --> 56:43.280]  maybe not, you know, a serious illustrator, but you're certainly a hobbyist illustrator, or at
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.120]  least you're a Batman illustrator. Well, so I do that to screw around. But my, one of, I drew every day,
[56:49.760 --> 56:54.000]  like comic booky stuff when I was growing up and I went to college for art. And then I worked as
[56:54.000 --> 57:01.360]  a designer for seven, eight years using Wacom tablets every day. And doing Photoshop and illustrator
[57:01.360 --> 57:05.840]  and in design just constantly until I became a muscle memory. And though I had a love, hate
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.160]  relationship with those because they were better than anything else, but they were never exactly
[57:10.160 --> 57:15.920]  a digital pen. And Apple's pencil is, it's remarkable. If, I'm sure if you just used it, you'd
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.640]  find that too. But if, if you've been using Wacom for a while or you've used styluses on the iPad,
[57:20.640 --> 57:25.280]  it's hard to, it's hard to properly frame the difference, but it just never felt like a proper
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.400]  pen to me. It wasn't heavy enough. It was too slippery. And Apple's fixed all of that. There is no
[57:30.400 --> 57:35.120]  paper drag, but they've got a material on the tip of the pencil that has just enough drag on the
[57:35.120 --> 57:39.120]  screen that makes you feel like it's a real thing, that there's real contact there. And the
[57:39.120 --> 57:45.360]  weight is absolutely perfect. And the way that it, they do this really fancy sort of prediction
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.560]  algorithm for where you're going to go. And once in a while, you can, you can, you can fool
[57:48.560 --> 57:53.280]  it, but it catches up super quick. But it makes you feel like you're literally drawing right on
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.600]  the screen. And because there's no inter mediating layer, the way there is with Wacom, they have a
[57:57.600 --> 58:02.560]  whole layer between the display and, and the sensors, it feels like you are drawing those pixels
[58:02.560 --> 58:06.960]  into the glass. And I used it for about, I did the same thing that you did. I went there at the
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.440]  end, and I used it for about 20 minutes. And I put my hand down on it to test palm rejection. I
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.440]  did very quick crosshatching. And she wanted to give me a whole long list of things to test
[58:15.440 --> 58:20.000]  too, because she did all the stylist reviews. And I did, I did everything I could to screw that thing
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.080]  over. And it kept with me. And it was the first time I actually felt like I could sit there with
[58:24.080 --> 58:29.120]  a pad of paper and sketch on a digital device. Yeah, that, that's something that didn't really
[58:29.120 --> 58:33.280]  occur to me during the event. I thought I was thinking of it. And I mean, obviously, you know, it
[58:33.280 --> 58:38.400]  was rumored that it was, you know, a big iPad. And it would, there'd be some kind of optional
[58:38.400 --> 58:42.960]  stylist type thing attached to it. So drawing was obviously part of it. It hadn't occurred to me
[58:42.960 --> 58:51.440]  though that they weren't just going for a better stylist on iPad experience than what was possible
[58:51.440 --> 59:01.360]  with third party styluses until now. And that instead, they were going to take like the wake-home
[59:01.360 --> 59:07.440]  stuff and make it look bad. You know, that this is the preeminent computerized drawing thing
[59:07.440 --> 59:12.640]  in the world period. It just didn't occur to me until afterwards in the hands-on area when I was
[59:12.640 --> 59:22.320]  walking around with Michael B. Johnson, aka Dr. Wave on Twitter. Honestly, I, I forewent first-hand
[59:22.320 --> 59:28.800]  experience with the, with the iPad and pen, because like we said, the hands-on area was crowded.
[59:30.000 --> 59:36.080]  I forewent doing that myself just to hang with Dr. Wave and listen to his questions. He was a
[59:36.080 --> 59:43.120]  guest, you know, but, you know, what he does at Pixar is build internal tools for Pixar artists
[59:44.400 --> 59:50.960]  and this device is great interest to him and to listen to his questions about refresh rates
[59:50.960 --> 59:57.520]  and parallax and all of that stuff. I felt like I learned more by letting, you know, just sort of
[59:57.520 --> 1:00:03.840]  being, you know, just looking over his shoulder, really, really fascinating. And it became clear
[1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:10.880]  in that aftermath that that's really what Apple had done is that this is, you know, a dramatic
[1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:15.840]  step forward in terms of drawing, you know, for any kind of artist.
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.840]  It's one of those things where they see an area where something is just not as good as they
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:22.960]  want it to be in the, if they believe that they can make a difference, they're going to go all
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:27.680]  out and try and do it. And they doubled the refresh, the scanning rate inside the Mac, sorry,
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:32.160]  the iPad Pro. So it technically doesn't work on older generation iPads so they could update the
[1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:36.240]  hardware eventually for that. But they're combining that with technology like the, the force
[1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:42.000]  touch or 3D touch inside the pencil and a lot of smarts for tilt direction positioning and
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:45.920]  they're measuring on a bunch of different axes and they've got all the software behind that too.
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:49.840]  And it really, it feels like magic. And that's a really dumb thing to say, but they're doing
[1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:53.680]  so much computational work there that the end, it ends up just feeling like a pencil.
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:59.840]  Yeah. There was a blog post I learned to yesterday written by Linda Dong, who now admittedly,
[1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:04.800]  she's a former Apple designer. So if you want to say she's biased, you can, but she's former,
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:08.880]  well, because if she was present, she wouldn't be blogging about it. But she's done interaction
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:14.240]  design and stuff for Apple and does a lot of her work, has done a lot of her work on, on the
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:20.960]  wake come syntax. I thought her little just quick, you know, like here's all the ways that this is
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:26.080]  better. It was amazing. So the syntax aren't retina. So they have pixels that an artist can see.
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.640]  The pen she says, you know, the pen you use with them is janky and it feels junky and has a bunch
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:39.280]  of buttons you can actually hit. There's parallax between the surface of the thing and the actual
[1:01:39.280 --> 1:01:43.920]  display underneath, which for almost any angle that would be comfortable for an artist is going to
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:51.680]  be an issue. And there's latency. There's palpable latency. Yes. So combine those highlights of
[1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:56.800]  here's how this thing is better. It's blowaway good. And you can almost see them the way that they
[1:01:56.800 --> 1:01:59.840]  did with the smartphone. They looked at the existing market and said, what are the problems? What
[1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:03.360]  are the pain points? And can we fix them? And they made that list and they just knocked them down
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:07.920]  one after the other. Yeah, my question, here's my big question about all of this though is
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:16.160]  and obviously there's, you know, however many other uses for the iPad Pro, but how big is the
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:23.520]  market for making the pen work as well as this is? I have no idea how big that market is.
[1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:26.960]  Yeah, I don't know either. I mean, there are a lot of people who went out and bought Microsoft
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:30.320]  Services just because they wanted to do this kind of illustration work. And that's, you know,
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:34.160]  obviously it wasn't enough to make the surface successful product, but it was interesting to me that
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.520]  there was that demand. And I don't think, I think sometimes Apple just wants to do what they
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:41.520]  think is better. And they know that that technology will trickle down like maybe in the future
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:46.160]  and iPad Air and iPad Mini, maybe even an iPhone will benefit from this technology, but it takes
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:49.760]  their launching a big product to bring everything together to make it a reality.
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:54.320]  Right, because there's a, there's all the magic that's in the pen and in theory that that,
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:03:02.160]  you know, the pen could work with any other device. But there's also new technology in the iPad
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:08.320]  Pro itself that works with the pen for getting the, you know, the pressure sensitivity and
[1:03:08.320 --> 1:03:15.200]  stuff like that. Like, however thin the layer now is in a modern, on the modern Apple devices
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:22.640]  between this, the actual display and the surface of the glass above it. However, thin that is,
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:28.080]  and I really do think they're not exaggerating to call that gap microscopic. They've got sensors
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:33.760]  in there to measure at microscopic levels the, the degree of pressure that's, you know, that's
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:39.280]  being a twice a resolution of the ones in the iPad Air and the iPhone, apparently. Yeah. Yeah. And
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:42.960]  they do magical stuff now with the, with the refresh rate where if they sense that you're not
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:46.640]  doing anything that's, that's very dynamic, they can cycle that down to save power. There's a lot
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:54.000]  of technology in that display. Yeah. And I think that they've, again, I think they've, they've,
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:00.560]  they've improved refresh rates in two ways. There's the drawing refresh rate where just what it's
[1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:07.760]  displaying what the iPad Pro is displaying has this dynamic visual refresh rate. So if you're
[1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:11.360]  watching a video where everything is changing all the time, it's, you know, refreshing at whatever
[1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:16.640]  rate. But if this, you know, it stops, if you're drawing something and you stop and it detects
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:21.520]  that you've stopped and nothing is animated on screen, it'll slow it down. And that can, you know,
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:28.800]  definitely save on the energy. But I also believe, if not know, that they have doubled the refresh
[1:04:28.800 --> 1:04:35.280]  rate of reading the touch sensors. Yeah. Right. And so as even if you're just drawing your, with
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:39.920]  your finger, even if you're just sliding your finger over it, it's got double the refresh rate of
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.320]  checking just where your finger is. Yeah. And it all comes together like to learn this post that
[1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:48.320]  it just does so many things that no one else is doing right now because they're hard things to do.
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.520]  That all those refresh rate things, those seem like things that could,
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:59.360]  couldn't will eventually trickle down to across the whole iOS lineup. I mean, why not? I mean,
[1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:04.880]  whether they'll work with the pen, I don't know. But at the very least, you know, increasing
[1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:11.280]  the touch refresh rate, you know, seems like it would be just, you know, useful in ways to any iPad
[1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:15.760]  and phone. Yeah, there is so much, I mean, they've shown their own custom timing controllers for
[1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:20.160]  things like the 5K iMac and now for the iPad Pro. They've shown that new chip that lets them
[1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:24.800]  flash the iPhone screen three times as bright to make a selfie flash. They've, they've shown
[1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:29.440]  they can do OLED with the Apple watch and keep things the super low refresh rate. Sorry, super
[1:05:29.440 --> 1:05:34.240]  low energy rate, super super efficient energy rates. Where they're going with all this, the thing
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:38.480]  that it's always so impressive to me is that Apple, they're not like Qualcomm and they're not even
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:42.320]  quite like Samsung. They get to make the parts exactly for what they want to do. So you take a look
[1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:47.120]  at like the A9 processor. And to me, this is light years ahead of the rest of the industry now. And
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:51.200]  if you told me 10 years ago, Apple would be leading in any chips that business, I would have thought
[1:05:51.200 --> 1:05:55.040]  it wasn't saying. But they're doing it and they're, they don't have to care about profit or loss
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:58.400]  on a chip set like Qualcomm does because they're not selling them. They don't have to worry about
[1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:02.640]  supporting Microsoft and Android and other architectures because they're only supporting their own.
[1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:07.040]  If they want to make a feature like like this, they can just make the silicon that supports it.
[1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:10.800]  And I think that over time, that becomes a stronger and stronger advantage for them.
[1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:19.200]  I really do wonder and I know that like something like Geekbench is not, it doesn't give you
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:23.280]  everything you need to know about how fast one machine is comparable to another.
[1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:28.080]  But it's not bad. It's not a bad like starting point if you just want to put a number on it.
[1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:35.440]  And I think Geekbench in particular is designed in a way that to me seems like a good balance
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:41.920]  of the various factors. Really, really curious to see where the iPad Pro benchmarks
[1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:49.040]  because I said last week that I think it'll benchmark like it might be like a 2013 MacBook Air.
[1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:56.720]  I'm wondering if I sold it short, it might be like the MacBook Air that you can go in and buy
[1:06:56.720 --> 1:07:02.080]  today. I'm not, maybe that's too much. I don't know. But I'm pretty sure that it's going to be
[1:07:02.080 --> 1:07:06.400]  close. There's almost like apples and oranges now because again, they are building the software
[1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:11.280]  and the hardware down to the chipset all to work together. And you don't see that like people will
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:15.680]  complain, oh, you know, an iPhone needs more RAM. Android's got four gigabytes of RAM. But that
[1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:19.200]  really is meaningless because they're running an interpreted language or in garbage collection.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:23.600]  They're not have, they don't have software that's built for a wide set of devices, not specifically.
[1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:27.280]  If you're saying you need more RAM because, oh, Safari can't keep a tab loaded to memory,
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:32.320]  that's absolutely justified. But their ability to do this lets them pick and choose exactly the
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:35.440]  components that they need. And I think that's where you get that performance from.
[1:07:35.440 --> 1:07:44.800]  Yeah. It's just sort of astounding though. I mean, it's to go from where the iPad started
[1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:50.480]  in 2010 and 2011. And it was a compelling invite at device, especially starting with the iPad
[1:07:50.480 --> 1:08:01.040]  2 in 2011. But not for reasons of pure performance compared to a Mac or even just like a MacBook
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:06.720]  Air, which has always been, you know, the slowest Mac in the lineup. It's for other reasons. It
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:12.240]  was okay. So it's not as fast, but you can carry it around all day, but it'll last 10 hours.
[1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:20.400]  But touch is more intimate. And it, you know, it sounds touchy-feely, no pun intended, but it
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:26.400]  really does give you a more intimate experience. There were all these but it's kind of fascinating
[1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:33.040]  that performance is no longer a but. Yeah. Well, if you look at the MacBook, the brand new MacBook,
[1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:38.080]  that's running broad well why. And it's hard to look at the Apple A9 and not think, you know,
[1:08:38.080 --> 1:08:44.000]  Apple's just sound like kicking their ass in a mobile too. It really does. And again, I think
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.600]  again, we'll see maybe I'm wrong. But if not, if I'm wrong, it's not going to be my much that
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:56.400]  that the iPad Air 2 or not iPad Air 2 iPad Pro is going to benchmark faster than the surface
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:03.440]  Pro 3s that are running Intel chips. And that was like the whole thing with the surface is that
[1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:08.720]  they had, well, we've got the regular surface, which is arm. And that's if you want something
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:14.320]  thinner and lighter. And then we've got the surface pro, which uses Intel's mobile chips because
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:19.520]  that's, you know, that's where you need for the speed. And Apple has, you know, relatively short
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:24.720]  order, just like two years later, as said, you don't need to make that compromise. You can get
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:31.920]  all the advantage, all of the advantages of arm and beat Intel on performance. I used to say this
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:35.440]  and people thought I was just being a dick, but I meant it that when you look at the surface,
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:40.720]  running Windows was not an advantage. It was a detriment in many cases. His windows was just not
[1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:45.920]  designed to do that at all. And iOS was, and that's why I think Apple with their tablets and even
[1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.160]  with the iPad Pro gets that right. I always wanted them to put went before they started merging
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:53.360]  everything. I always wanted to put Windows phone on a surface and see what it could really do.
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.240]  But just the idea that this is a touch first mobile operating system built on a device that is
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:05.040]  mobile, it gives them a tremendous advantage. Yeah, I think so too. The next thing in addition
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:09.920]  to the pencil for the iPad Pro is the, and here, you know, it can't not talk about the surface
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:17.120]  in this case is the smart keyboard, where you've got a magnetically attached keyboard or cover
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:23.360]  that when you unfold it has a physical keyboard inside. So much better than the original iPad
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:28.080]  with that keyboard stand. Oh, absolutely. But it's funny, you know, it's funny how you go around
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:31.920]  in it five years. It just looks like what the hell were they thinking. But at the time, they,
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:38.880]  you know, they didn't know. They just didn't know. But clearly this smart keyboard is, you know,
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:53.040]  Microsoft did it first. I mean, so credit to them. I'm curious why it's, and maybe the answer
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:57.600]  is just wait a year, or maybe wait half a year, who knows, maybe they'll be an event,
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:01.600]  I don't think it's going to be an event this year, but maybe they'll be like an early 2016 event.
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:08.560]  Why there's not one for the iPad Air 2? And I know that it's full size, you know, it's bigger
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:12.880]  and more comfortable. And I've, you know, tried the ones in the demo area last week. But it seems to
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:19.680]  me like an iPad Air 2 is big enough for a keyboard. My guess is they're waiting for the iPad Air 3,
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.680]  which will have those same three connectors that the iPad Pro has that makes the docking and
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:29.040]  undocking so easy for the new keyboard. That's exactly what I was thinking to exactly. I think it's
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:33.040]  got to have those three, it's got to have those three, whatever they're calling it, smart connector.
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:38.080]  Yes, smart connector. Look at me remembering the name of some. I think it's got to be that
[1:11:38.080 --> 1:11:43.920]  they're waiting for an iPad Air 3. It'll have the smart connector and it just wasn't ready yet.
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:50.080]  And or maybe they didn't want to maybe they didn't want to really see it yet.
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:53.680]  Yeah, going back to your older point and the thing with Steve Jobs that was so great on stage is he
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:56.880]  could not, he wasn't just that he saw the story and could arrange their products, but he could tell
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:02.400]  you the story. And maybe the original iPhone and the iPad 2 events were quintessential examples of that.
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:07.040]  And I think this Apple knows that they're not quite as good at telling stories yet. And you know,
[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:11.040]  absent that narrative, I think that they have to be, they have to be more focused. And if they
[1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:15.440]  start talking about an iPad Air with the keyboard or with the pens, it just takes away from the
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.440]  iPad Pro and they need to be very careful about keeping the focus on that one product.
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:24.880]  Yeah, I think you're right. I think it makes sense even if they could have done it now that it
[1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:32.080]  made sense to wait. And maybe it will be. Maybe they'll go off cycle with iPad Air 4. Or I guess it'd
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:37.200]  be iPad Air 3 and maybe do it in the spring if they have something else to announce with it.
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:42.000]  Yeah, it's interesting because the watch, the watch debuted with WatchOS one, but WatchOS two is
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.520]  coming out with the same hardware. They're not, they're not linking those products like those.
[1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:51.280]  So maybe they're willing to do that more often. Yeah, and it's, you know, I don't think they're
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:55.760]  married to it. And they kind of are with the iPhone. It's convenient though. I mean, the best time
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:00.160]  to show it off is WWDC and the best time to ship iPhones is in September. And those things just
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:06.240]  line up very nicely for them. Yeah, I think with something new like the watch, it's, it's so
[1:13:06.240 --> 1:13:11.360]  unpredictable or not what? Yeah, well, the watch is, it's, it's so unpredictable that it makes
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:17.360]  sense to just not worry about getting it on the exact quarter that you want it to come out on until
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:24.080]  they're more, more regularized, you know, production and everything. Absolutely. And no, no more about
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:29.840]  the, you know, also they need to stay. I mean, those Apple, like you said, they have small teams
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:34.640]  and those teams are continuously running marathons of sprints. And they have to like almost like,
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.240]  you know, when Guy talks about the video game industry, they have to be careful to, to balance
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:43.440]  those people out because they will burn them if they're not careful. Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:56.000]  So here's what's in our smart keyboard cover is 169 bucks. Yeah, which is a lot really. I mean,
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:03.520]  especially since the starting price on the iPad lineup is now like $249, like you can get and iPad.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:10.400]  I mean, it's, you know, it's the, the old mini, but you can get a whole iPad for $249, but the
[1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:15.920]  keyboard for the iPad Pro is 169 bucks. I think it's the most expensive Apple keyboard since my
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:21.280]  beloved Apple extended keyboard too. Microsoft Surface Pro type cover keyboard and Canadian
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:28.880]  dollar at least is 175. Yeah, and it's, you know, I think it's a complicated bit of machinery.
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:35.360]  So I, I, and I think it feels like a valuable cover. Um, and obviously since the whole machine
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:43.920]  is 800 to $1,100. And I think, I think most people who buy this are going to get the $1,100
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:50.240]  one. They're going to get the one with 128 gigs and the cellular for consumers. Um, you go big or
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:57.120]  you go kindle. I think that's where we've learned. Yeah. Um, well, I think that the, that the entry
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  level one oddly enough is, is more for like, uh, internal professional setting. Like, like,
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:06.480]  like, yeah, I think sometimes people are like, an Apple could do more. They could absolutely
[1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:10.160]  identify the use to do with the eMac and identify those skills better, but like 16 gigabyte
[1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:16.880]  iPhones and, uh, iPad tos and this entry level iPad Pro, there are people who are buying 2000 of
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:21.040]  them for enterprise and all they want is business to business apps and web portals and they,
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:25.520]  they will take, they'll take almost no storage. Well, I think, I think even for like an artistic
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:30.080]  purpose where you're doing really high-end work, but at a place like if you've got like, uh,
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:35.680]  studio and you're doing work on a special effects on a movie or something like that. And you
[1:15:35.680 --> 1:15:41.040]  want all of your artists to have this. It makes sense to just buy the Wi-Fi low storage one
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:45.120]  because the storage isn't really going to be on the iPad anyway. It's going to be on the server
[1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:49.920]  within your, you know, within your outfit. You know, I mean, like they're, it's not like the artists
[1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:55.440]  on working on Star Wars or keeping all of the data on their local machine. I mean, it's,
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:58.960]  yeah, it's, it's exactly this caught me nearly your Larry, Larry Ellison thin client. That's,
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:03.840]  that's what we're talking to finally. Yeah, it's exactly that. And so it makes sense to just get the,
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:08.560]  the one without the, you know, it's not the end the studio. These, these are system machines.
[1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:14.400]  They're not leaving. So they don't need cellular. That's just, you know, wasted, you know, wasted
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:19.200]  money and wasted thickness. If, if they're a little thicker like they were or just a wasted antenna,
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:23.120]  um, and they don't need the storage. If they're never going to use the storage,
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:27.040]  why in the world buy it, why not just, you know, get the low in one. So I think it is odd that
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:31.440]  there's no LTE skew for that because Apple's always had the same Wi-Fi and LTE skews for all of
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:35.280]  their iPads. This is the first time where you have to get the more expensive one if you want LTE.
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:40.480]  Yeah, that is interesting. But I do think it's telling towards the intended use. Yes. I think that
[1:16:41.120 --> 1:16:46.720]  if you want to use it as a laptop, you know, this is my portable. Now, I shouldn't even say
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:51.040]  laptop because it's, you know, laptop word is loaded in terms of how you use it as your portable
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:59.600]  computer. You know, it's, um, you're going to want the, the additional storage because 128 gigs
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:06.160]  of bytes of storage is not that much for a portable computer. No. And it's for a gigabytes of RAM
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:10.640]  too. So I mean, it does have the constraints of a mobile device still. Right. But it's, you know,
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:17.920]  that's the one that's specked out like a, this is my portable computer. And the 32 gig one is
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:23.120]  specked out like this is like an artist. This is my studio computer. Right. This is my drawing tablet.
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:27.600]  Did you get a chance to try the keyboard? I, I spent only a few minutes with it, but I like the
[1:17:27.600 --> 1:17:32.000]  Mac, like I like low keyboards. I like the MacBook keyboard a lot. And I know you have very different
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.520]  tastes and keyboards. Yeah, I don't like any laptop keyboard though. Like I don't even, you know,
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:45.520]  like I think that the Mac book pro keyboard I have right now is probably my favorite laptop
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:51.200]  keyboard I've ever used. Um, and if not, it's close. And I still think it's kind of a crap keyboard
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:56.080]  compared to my, you know, big clacky, yeah, Apple extended keyboard too. I make do. I mean, I write,
[1:17:56.080 --> 1:18:00.720]  you know, thousands of words a year on that MacBook Pro. Um, if you could connect an IBM
[1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:06.480]  electric, you would. Well, probably not in, not in any of the areas where I would use the MacBook Pro. I
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:10.640]  would only do that if I were using it as my only computer, you know, I'm my desk. Yes. But then
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:14.880]  one more. So I mean, I make do. I mean, I am picky about keyboards, but I make do. I don't find
[1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:19.280]  the new MacBook one. Again, I haven't lived with that machine. So I don't know, but just playing
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:23.200]  around with it and the stores and stuff. I mean, I could definitely make do. It doesn't seem that
[1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:34.480]  much worse than the, the, uh, 11 inch MacBook Air that I used as my portable for four years.
[1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:37.920]  Yeah. I use it. I took me an hour to get used to it. And my problem I have now is that it's still
[1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:41.200]  it goes right to the edge of the machine. So every time I pick it up, I accidentally hit escape or
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:45.440]  enter or something. I have to remember to pick it up from the bottom. Yeah. And it does, it,
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:51.120]  it having tried this thing at the event last week, the keyboard, you know, the travel is obviously
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:57.680]  very low, but it travels enough that it's there absolutely is a clickiness to it, which in and of
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:05.120]  itself is a huge win over, um, and anything like that that I've tried before, you know, and I
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:09.280]  liked that Apple had me logitech announced the same day. So Apple is letting anyone connect,
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:12.880]  maybe not anyone, but their letting partners connect to those smart connectors. And that means
[1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:16.320]  that there'll be a range of different keyboards available for it. Yeah. I thought that that
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:21.120]  logitech announcement was interesting and sort of another new Apple thing where they obviously,
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:27.680]  you know, looped, looped them in in advance. And, you know, they haven't unveiled the details,
[1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:33.600]  but they obviously looped them in. And I think I think the thinking is that Apple decided this
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:37.520]  is what we want to build. We want to build one keyboard. It's going to be a fold up cover.
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:42.800]  Obviously with this port, the potential is there for all sorts of other things, including
[1:19:42.800 --> 1:19:48.880]  something that's more of like a leave it at your desk base station, right? So if you're just going
[1:19:48.880 --> 1:19:53.600]  to use this, and I think this is a very, for a lot of people, I think it's a really interesting
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:59.440]  scenario where this is your main computer and you take it around. When you're at your desk,
[1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:04.800]  why don't you, when you want a keyboard that's even better as a key, as a keyboard,
[1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:10.400]  then the smart cover. Well, there, there's lots exactly what this logitech seems like. We don't
[1:20:10.400 --> 1:20:15.760]  know the details. They've only shown one little carefully cropped photo of it, but I mean,
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:20.080]  that's what it seems like to me. Yeah, I still have a drafting table that I've used since I
[1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:24.400]  was in high school and I was figuring, you know, could I put the iPad pro on that and then tilt it
[1:20:24.400 --> 1:20:27.760]  down when I want to draw on it, then tilt it up and just stick it in the keyboard when I want to,
[1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:31.680]  I'm trying to figure out all the possible use cases. It's almost like a lazy boy situation now,
[1:20:31.680 --> 1:20:38.240]  where you can recline as much as you want. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I wonder how much you can adjust
[1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:42.320]  the logitech keyboard and obviously there's going to be others. Everybody else who makes these
[1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:50.400]  these sort of peripherals is going to make something for this. And it is going to be a MFI port,
[1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:56.560]  is MFI still made for iPhone or iPod originally? But yeah, like even the Apple watch stuff,
[1:20:56.560 --> 1:21:00.720]  I think they're calling MFI still instead of MFW. Right. And which is really weird there because
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:08.960]  there's no eye involved. Yeah, it's going to be MFI. It's exactly, you know, license exactly along,
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:14.240]  you know, the same way that they license things like the lightning adapter. So anybody who wants
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:17.440]  to is going to be able to play along. But I think that's really interesting. And it really
[1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:23.200]  occurs to me. People have been chasing the dream of the docked computer. I mean, as long as there've
[1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:28.480]  been portables. I mean, the apples had, you know, what were they called the duos? Yeah, the power
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:34.240]  book duos with docks. And there's pros and cons with all of them. But the big thing whenever you try
[1:21:34.240 --> 1:21:41.520]  to do it is, and you don't even today, there's maybe not, there's there's no dock for a MacBook pro.
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:49.360]  But certainly you can. And I know, I know lots and lots of people who do live off one computer.
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:55.040]  It's probably a MacBook pro. And but when they get to their desk, they have a nice big display
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:04.720]  to connect it to. The hassle of the docked lifestyle is in the tethering and untethering of all the
[1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:12.720]  various things you need to plug in power and USB. And, you know, especially on the Mac, the big
[1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:17.040]  annoying thing is if you have, if you need to connect external storage, well, now you've got this
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.080]  thing that you can't just unplug, you actually have to go in and software and unmount it and make sure
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:27.200]  that whatever software was using it is no longer using those open files. And if you just want to
[1:22:27.200 --> 1:22:31.520]  get up and go until you just paint any ass with the iPad pro, you're never going to have to do
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:37.760]  anything but get up and go. And you probably won't even need, in most cases, because of the battery
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:43.040]  life with things get, you won't even need to plug in lightning to charge the iPad while you're
[1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:48.480]  using it. You'll just charge the iPad overnight, come in to the office and just, could chunk, put it
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:22:52.880]  right on your keyboard and then whenever you want to get up and go, just, just pick it up.
[1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:56.320]  And it's super fascinating to me too, because there are some companies who really think that they
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:01.120]  can, that was a famous Microsoft saying, right? No compromises. And it resulted in the biggest
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:05.360]  compromise ever, because you literally cannot be all things to all people. You can't serve every
[1:23:05.360 --> 1:23:09.840]  market equally well. And Apple is being very, they're taking interesting choices here. Like the
[1:23:09.840 --> 1:23:14.560]  MacBook is as close as you can get to being an iPad while still being a Mac. And this is as close
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:18.640]  as you can get to being a MacBook almost while still being an iPad. And they're not trying to do
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:22.560]  it all in one device. They're giving you these devices that both have unique identities still,
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:27.040]  but are optimized along the same sort of line. And you just pick which side of it you want to be on.
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:35.840]  Yeah. That's a good way to put it. I mean, but, and you know, there's obviously compromises with
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:39.600]  all of it. You know, there's, you know, the compromises with the iPad pro are obvious. There is no
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:44.640]  external storage because there's no concept of it in iOS. There is no USB port or USB-C or anything
[1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:51.600]  that you can plug in an external drive. It doesn't have built in SD card. You have to go, you know,
[1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:56.400]  with the lightning to SD card thing. And it's not, you know, it works. People use it, but it's not
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.320]  something you're going to keep plugged in all the time. You have to mostly want a tablet and then
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:03.760]  just occasionally want to use a keyboard with, or, you know, just for a certain segment of things
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:10.000]  use a keyboard for it. So I'm in there. What do you think they're going to sell more of? I off the
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.120]  top of your head. Do you think they're going to sell more smart keyboards or pencils?
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:18.240]  I, I'm just assuming, maybe I'm biased because that's my background, but I'm assuming the pencil
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:23.920]  because that really is a completely better take on that technology where we've had sort of keyboards
[1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:28.720]  on, on iPads before and maybe Logitech will sell more than Apple even. We don't know. There's
[1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:32.960]  be a whole, there'll be fragmented across a variety of manufacturers, but I think the pencil is going
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:38.640]  to be unique to this device for a while. Yeah. And I think that there's, as kids grow older,
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:43.200]  I know the ATP guys mentioned it last week, but I've heard about it from Apple people for years
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:48.640]  is that the younger you are, the less likely you are to really give a crap about on-screen keyboard
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:52.960]  versus physical keyboard of any kind, whether it's built into the cover or whatever, that,
[1:24:53.600 --> 1:25:01.520]  you know, kids who've grown up or are growing up in the iOS era see an on-screen touch keyboard
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:06.640]  as completely normal. It's interesting because previously like you and I went through the
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:11.440]  migration from digital to become digitally native people weren't digitally native. They were
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:15.440]  analog native. They were reading newspapers and they became digitally native. And now you have
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:20.960]  people who are touch native and using external and intermediate input devices is just not the
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:24.960]  computing that they understand. Even when the MacBook launched and people were complaining they
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:28.240]  couldn't plug their external monitor into it. The amount of people who plugged an external monitor
[1:25:28.240 --> 1:25:32.800]  into a MacBook is tiny. It's all of our friends on Twitter, but it's, it's single digit percentage
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:37.520]  points. And it's just not normal behavior. And that's, I think, increasingly driving Apple's products.
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.240]  Yeah. I think so too. Anything else on iPad Pro, you want to talk about?
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:46.080]  I mean, I don't know if you had a chance to try them, but the speakers were just, they were
[1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:50.480]  marvelous. You could just turn them. They had these big echo chambers for really loud speakers.
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:55.280]  And when you rotated from landscape to portrait or just 360 degrees, it kept up with you.
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:03.440]  Yeah. It occurs to me that for all the belly-eaking that's gone on about the mono output of iOS
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:14.400]  devices, that the way that they went stereo with this is like, oh, and going with four speakers,
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:20.720]  that had never occurred to me before. Maybe because I'm unimaginative. But, and that, you know,
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.920]  obviously, just like the screen rotates, the speakers rotate, or at least, you know,
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:29.680]  the speakers don't physically rotate, but the concept of which sound is coming from whichever
[1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:33.760]  it knows. They crossfade. Yeah. Right. And those what's up, what's down, what's left, what's right,
[1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:40.240]  no matter which way you're holding the device. And boy, in the demo area, as noisy and crowded,
[1:26:40.240 --> 1:26:45.040]  as it was, boy, it certainly seemed like something like, hey, that's something.
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:49.200]  Yeah. It was really impressive. And I just can't wait to actually get the device and put on
[1:26:49.200 --> 1:26:54.000]  like Avengers Age of Ultron or something full blast and start rotating in Seattle. Well, it does.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:27:00.160]  Yeah. It's kind of interesting. And I wonder, you know, I, you know, like, I don't know, a lot of
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:06.160]  people watch a lot of video on iPads. It's, that's, yeah. Size is obviously makes it better if you're
[1:27:06.160 --> 1:27:09.680]  willing to carry it around, but boy, the difference in sound output, if you're not using headphones,
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:14.640]  is dramatic now. And this, I mean, before people used to joke that the iPad is a big iPhone,
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:18.960]  I always thought it was more like an iPhone gone iMacs. And this really is an iPad gone iMacs
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.080]  because when you're holding it close, it fills your field of view. And whether it's a game or a
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:28.080]  movie or something, it really is immersive. Yeah. Totally agree. Um, the weight, I guess,
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:35.520]  the last thing I'll just mention is, uh, I know that it sounds bad that it's a little like a
[1:27:35.520 --> 1:27:41.040]  300 of a pound heavier than the original iPad, because the original iPad sure feels heavy compared
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:47.120]  to modern iPad. Um, and there's certain scenarios where I guess if you're walking around with it
[1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:52.080]  and holding it in certain ways, you're definitely going to feel that. But it's so much more balanced
[1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:57.920]  and it, it, it sure is hard to believe that it's as heavy as an original iPad when you pick it
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:02.560]  up and hold it, because it's, it's so much more distributed, um, throughout the whole device.
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:06.880]  Yeah. It's like the iPhone 6 Plus is equivalent to a smaller heavier iPhone, but because it's so
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:10.640]  spread out, you really don't feel that in normal use, especially when you hold it near the middle.
[1:28:10.640 --> 1:28:17.520]  Yeah, it definitely feels lightweight, even though it's, you know, by iPad standards, humongous. Um,
[1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:24.000]  all right, let's move on. Let me take another break here and thank, um, our next sponsor and
[1:28:24.640 --> 1:28:31.200]  another long time friend of the show. Love these guys. Igloo. Igloo is the internet. You will
[1:28:31.200 --> 1:28:37.360]  actually like you, I say intranet and you work in enterprises of that and you just, you're probably
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:42.880]  already like rolling your eyes, you're sick because, uh, most intranets that are out there, like
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:48.720]  SharePoint stuff like that look like they were designed in 1997. And, uh, in large part, it's because
[1:28:48.720 --> 1:29:00.240]  they were, uh, in Igloo is modern new internet software hosted by them. And it is modern in all the
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:07.520]  right ways. Uh, everything they do is, um, looks just as good and it looks like it was just as well
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:14.640]  designed for your phone as it was for your, uh, desktop, your laptop, where you're, you know,
[1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:20.000]  you're upcoming new iPad Pro. Uh, really, really good stuff. Let's you share whatever things
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.880]  you can do with Igloo. What is an internet and for the modern day look like? Let's you share news,
[1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:32.880]  organize files, share files, coordinate calendars, manage projects, uh, set up little micro blogs,
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:37.600]  which is sort of like having your own internal Twitter private just for your team, just for your
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:44.160]  company, all in one place. Uh, their latest upgrade, the one that they've been working on for 2015,
[1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:49.920]  revolves around documents and how you interact with them, gather feedback and make changes.
[1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:57.360]  Um, so they've added things like the ability to track who has read critical information to keep
[1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:02.400]  everyone on the same page. It's more or less like read receipts in email, except, uh, just for shared
[1:30:02.400 --> 1:30:07.440]  documents on the internet and way less annoying and read receipts in email. Um, but if you've got a
[1:30:07.440 --> 1:30:12.960]  document that, uh, certain people on your team have to sign off on for some kind of compliance or just
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:17.920]  the way the rules of your, your teamwork, uh, you do that through Igloo and you get that feedback
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:24.000]  right there in the Igloo system itself. Um, really, really great. Apparently really, really high
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:29.600]  in demand from their customers. So, um, you know, me, my team is one person. I, but, you know, a lot of
[1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:33.680]  people out there have teams with more people, uh, signing off on these agreements and stuff like
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:39.680]  that and get into confirmation right in the Igloo system. Big, big hit this year. Uh, if your company
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:46.160]  has a legacy internet, some kind of crap, or if you don't have any kind of internet and you're
[1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:53.040]  just winging it without any kind of centralized organized internet to keep your team organized,
[1:30:53.040 --> 1:31:00.480]  you really should give Igloo a try. Uh, and it's no lose giving that a try is the easiest thing
[1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:06.800]  in the world. You can get a free trial at igloo software dot com slash the talk show. You don't
[1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:10.400]  really need the slash of the talk show, but it lets them know where you're coming from. You
[1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:16.400]  got a free trial. You get up to 10 people on your team. You can set up everything you want.
[1:31:16.400 --> 1:31:20.000]  The whole thing just works. You can see all the features, see all the things I've been telling you
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.800]  about. And from to 10 people, it's just free. And that's not just free for a limited time. It's
[1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:28.800]  just free. So if you work on a really small team, if you've got under 10 people, you can just use
[1:31:28.800 --> 1:31:35.840]  Igloo for free in perpetuity, which is a deal you can't beat. If you've got more than 10 people,
[1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:42.240]  try it with a small team first. See how good it is. And then check out their pricing on additional
[1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:46.400]  users. It's super, super competitive. Really, really good. It's about as low as you would think
[1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:51.360]  for something that's free for up to 10 people on perpetuity. Really good pricing. Great features.
[1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:56.480]  And, and they're really innovating their brand innovating. It sounds over rot. What they're doing is just
[1:31:56.480 --> 1:32:02.240]  building new features at a slow steady pace, uh, really, really impressive. They keep working on it.
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:07.040]  It's not, you know, static software. They're really working on it. It's great stuff. So my thanks
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:14.080]  to igloo software at igloo software.com slash the talk show. What was the next thing they announced?
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:19.920]  Apple TV. Yeah. Uh, I don't want to spend too much time on it yet because we just don't know that much.
[1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:25.920]  But my first impressions are that it's exactly what I wanted. And I even bitched last week on the
[1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:32.240]  show that the main thing I really wanted was is something Syracuse has been talking about for years
[1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:38.400]  too, is to get fast forward and reverse scrubbing, get the latency on that and the user experience
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:44.560]  of that modernize that do what you know that a computer can do, which is, you know, give it a good
[1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.440]  feel and give it a sense that you know where they're, how you're going and where you're going to
[1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:54.080]  stop. Um, and at least on the, I know on the on stage demonstrations that look great in the hands
[1:32:54.080 --> 1:33:01.520]  on area, it worked as advertised in my hands. It was really good. And that's what you've ever
[1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:07.200]  used the iPhone remote app. Well, you slide and it goes too far. It doesn't go far. It doesn't
[1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:11.120]  solve the, that iPhone remote app doesn't solve the problem at all. And in fact, it never,
[1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:16.080]  never does. I never worked the way I wanted to. It's this was phenomenal. It was just exactly
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:22.000]  where I wanted it to be. Now, whether it'll work like that for all content from all sources,
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:26.960]  I don't know because I have found with the current Apple TV that some are worse than others.
[1:33:28.800 --> 1:33:33.040]  You know, and iTunes movies, which, you know, you don't really stream, which is kind of
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:39.680]  download in a chunk work better. Um, so who knows how the streaming will work, but I, I, you know,
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:44.720]  I know that there were people from the, that streaming in particular was something that they wanted
[1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:48.480]  to get better to. So we'll see how it works in a real world and we'll see what kind of partnership
[1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:52.480]  they get with the companies like Netflix and HBO and, and we're seeing more partnerships too,
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:56.880]  like HBO famously switched to the MLB team streaming for there. And, and those companies are just going
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:03.040]  to get better and better at it. Well, and I think that they have every interest in working with Apple
[1:34:03.040 --> 1:34:07.920]  on getting their experience on this thing as good as possible and talking to people from the Apple
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:12.240]  TV team last week, there's no doubt in my mind that they, they take that seriously. Like there
[1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:17.200]  was a, you know, they're exactly like I was hoping that they were. They really, they were completely
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:25.840]  dissatisfied with the fast-forward and reverse experience on the old Apple TV and didn't want to just
[1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:31.200]  make it a little better, wanted to really kind of bring it to the, the, the modern day and really
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:36.560]  just take it greatly forward in that. And I couldn't be more excited about that. And I know this
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.680]  is nerdy, but what I really like is that for a while now, at least on the Apple TV, iPhone and iPad,
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:45.840]  we've been running iOS under the covers of just across the platform. And now the watch is that too,
[1:34:45.840 --> 1:34:51.040]  they all run iOS and they all have, you know, backboard and frontboard as the, the platform for
[1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:54.560]  those technologies. And then the iPhone and iPad have springboard, the watch has carousel,
[1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:58.720]  and now Apple TV has, I forget, it was a pine board and headboard or something. But they're all,
[1:34:58.720 --> 1:35:03.600]  they're all the same thing. They all running the same platform. You can, as a user, I, I
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:07.680]  I meant it or the details of the watch compared to the TV compared to the iPhone, but I can figure it
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:12.320]  out because they are very similar things. And for developers, yes, Apple's doing things like
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:17.600]  they're making WebKit and the web basically a private API for the watch and the Apple TV. And that
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:21.440]  does have consequences. But essentially, if you know how to make apps for one of them, you can make
[1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:25.920]  apps for all of them, making a watch extension, or making an Apple TV app is not something foreign to
[1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:29.600]  you. It's not a whole new platform you have to learn. And all the technologies that Apple's been
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:35.440]  doing, like we talked about for iOS 7 and iOS 8. And now in iOS 9, those are leveraged across
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:39.280]  all of these devices. And it's one of those things where everything Apple does for one of them
[1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:46.640]  ends up making all of them better again. I totally agree, right? There's, there's a lot of
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:59.280]  reuse and it, everything is not as siloed as it was in the old days. No, they have teams working,
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.440]  like the message is same on the watch knows, like our part and parcel with the message is
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:07.840]  even not the exact people, but they're not segregated anymore. And on demand resources, I mean,
[1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:13.840]  that's interesting at, at, at WWDC when they talk about it as part of app thinning. But then you
[1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:18.400]  see an Apple TV and they don't want, and I know there was some concern about this, but they don't
[1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:23.280]  want you to have a 32 gigabyte Apple TV and you go to download an app and it says your Apple TV is full,
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:26.000]  you have to delete something and you got to go and try and figure out they don't want you to be
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:31.360]  anywhere near that experience. So there, if your Apple TV is empty, they'll download a 200 megabyte
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:35.760]  initial file and then immediately start downloading a two gigabyte tag and then immediately start
[1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:40.640]  downloading more and as much as they can. But if your Apple TV is almost full, they'll download that
[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.920]  first really small file, which will almost assuredly fit and then start removing the less frequently
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:49.920]  used and older data so they can make room for the new frequently used data. And they're doing this
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:54.960]  whole nearline management system that makes these devices, hopefully, I guess the goal is to make
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:37:00.000]  that all seamless for the end user. And yes, it's absolutely more work for developers to go through
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  and make these resource laces and tag them and do everything. But the result is, you know, you're
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.440]  sitting there and you want to play Minecraft, you don't get that pop up saying, sorry, can't
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:14.720]  install it. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think, you know, and, and Syrunde called well tackled it very
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:18.800]  ably in a piece. I don't know if it came out yesterday or at least yesterday was when I saw it,
[1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:30.800]  but, you know, that it quickly got misinterpreted as apps for Apple TV have a 200 megabyte limit
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:37.840]  and knowing that, you know, there's an awful lot of games that that's not enough for. That's not the
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.320]  case. It's just a 200 megabyte initial download just to have an app that's on your Apple TV that
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:48.960]  you can launch 200 megabyte limit. And then after that, whatever other resources you need and
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.400]  let's face it, we're mostly talking about games, you can start downloading immediately.
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:58.080]  And it could be anything. It could be levels. It could be texture maps. It could be like you've seen
[1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:02.480]  the, the introductory tutorial video. You don't need that anymore. It throws it away. You don't
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:06.880]  need these cutscenes anymore. You don't need these costume packs or you don't need this expansion pack.
[1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:10.000]  It just throws those away. I mean, guy did, I forget where we could go. I did a really good
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.480]  explanation of this too. And I understand like this is not, if you just use Unity or you just use
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:19.600]  Epic's engine, maybe this is, it could be even impossible. I don't know, but it might be very
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:24.160]  difficult to slice your app this way, but they're, they're, they're solving for me sitting on my
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:33.760]  couch on a small capacity device. Yeah. So I'm impressed by the video latency. I am delighted
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:40.560]  at this prospect of apps and games for the thing. I think I like the controller. I don't know
[1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:46.640]  that it's going to be a great controller for games. I think how much gaming actually takes place
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:53.680]  on this thing. I really don't know about, but I think in terms of using it to watch TV, it is, it
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:59.520]  has the potential to truly be what we've always hoped Apple TV would be. I agree. And you can
[1:38:59.520 --> 1:39:03.520]  only, right now you can only have one of them attached. And unfortunately, the remote you're talking
[1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:06.160]  about. Yeah, you can only have one of the Apple remote attached. If you want to have other
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:10.800]  things, you have to use iOS devices, probably running an updated version of the Apple remote app,
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:15.040]  or you have to use the made for iPhone, which is now in the misnomer, the made for iPhone game
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:18.800]  controllers. And recently, it looks like there was a change in policy that says you have to at
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:24.160]  least include controls for the Apple remote. You can't make a game that's in a life controller
[1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:28.560]  only. Yeah. And that's led to some consternation too, because the Apple remote doesn't have the
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:37.120]  physical capabilities of a full game pad. Right. Like there's no way to simulate a D-pad and an analog
[1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:42.960]  stick. And a trigger, but yeah, and all those things. And shoulder buttons, etc. So yeah, that's
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:51.920]  obviously going to limit. It's obviously going to limit some of the games that can come out.
[1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:56.800]  But my hope is that, because again, this causes a lot of angst on Twitter. But the best thing you
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:40:00.160]  can do is file a radar, write an article explaining, like if you just write an
[1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:04.000]  Apple hates gamers, then that doesn't really get anyone's attention. It's easy to dismiss that.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.040]  But write a really informed article about this is what the game you want to make,
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:11.280]  why is awesome, and why how Apple is stopping you. And these debates go on inside, like we all
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:14.800]  hear them, they go on inside the company too, they're people fighting for both sides of this all
[1:40:14.800 --> 1:40:19.120]  the time. And if you have a stake in one side or another, just arm them as best you can.
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:24.240]  Yeah, I have heard though, and I know we talked about it offline, but that you, you know,
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:30.960]  the buttons on their remote are programmable, you know, by the app. So you can use the buttons
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:36.080]  for game buttons. But you're still, you know, you're obviously limited in some way by the fact
[1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.280]  that it's just, you've got the accelerometer, so you can do like the paddle game type stuff that
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:48.640]  they showed on stage. And, you know, whatever else you can do with that we moat style waving
[1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:54.640]  the thing at the screen. And you have a touchpad, but clearly that's no substitute for a D-pad.
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:40:59.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's just, these things are always attention to whether it's going to, like, what do
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:03.920]  you need to control a great entertainment center, and what do you need to control a great video
[1:41:03.920 --> 1:41:08.000]  game? And I remember using my Xbox Media Center with the Xbox controller, and that wasn't great.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.560]  I had to go and buy the hardware controller. But that was sort of stupid for games. So like you end up
[1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:19.840]  with these environments. I also saw some confusion. A lot of people seem confused that when you look
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:23.920]  at like the user interface guidelines that they have the difference, they have something,
[1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:30.560]  things that involve a click and things that involve a tap. And I think it's funny, I didn't see
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:37.120]  any confusion over this until after I had had my hands on period with them. I think that
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.880]  I think that what it is is that the touchpad clicks when you press it,
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:51.600]  but you can also just tap it without clicking. Sort of like a Mac book trackpad.
[1:41:52.240 --> 1:41:56.720]  Yeah, I couldn't get a clear answer about that. And you did with so much going on,
[1:41:56.720 --> 1:42:00.000]  and I neglected to follow up properly, but I heard both that you couldn't
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:06.080]  click and tap on it. Yeah. Well, I think you can tap, and you can click, and the click is
[1:42:06.080 --> 1:42:10.560]  actually a physical click, and the tap is just like tapping. So it's effectively like the way that
[1:42:10.560 --> 1:42:14.400]  a MacBook can have taps that don't actually click it, and a click, which is a click.
[1:42:15.360 --> 1:42:19.120]  Like the magic trackpad, if you haven't set up that way. Yeah, I think we're going to need more
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:24.240]  than, you know, two minutes of hands-on area demo time with it to really figure it out.
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:27.840]  And the serious stuff was way better than I thought, because you know,
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:32.400]  we have serious often been our point of concern for some people, but I tried all that stuff,
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:35.920]  and just the ability to say, what did he say? And it goes back 30 seconds or something,
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:41.040]  and gives you the subtitles at the same time. That is such a great feature. It really is. And part
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:46.800]  of it comes to the, the whole like being better at scrubbing and keeping, keeping more of that
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:53.360]  streamed video, you know, alive and memory so that you can do that. But then turning on the
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.080]  captions for that, it's such a great accessibility feature. And it's one of those accessibility
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:05.440]  features that is like, it just shows that accessibility is for can be for anybody. Like you
[1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:10.640]  couldn't have, you know, absolutely nothing that you, you know, perfect vision, great hearing,
[1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:16.080]  you know, no motor skill problems at all. But a feature like that, like if you just can't make out
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:22.560]  what a character said, that's accessibility, right? That just shows how accessibility don't think of
[1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:27.200]  accessibility as being for others, for people who have some sort of disabilities or something like
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:34.240]  that. It, it, it really, you know, it certainly is more important for people who have disabilities.
[1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:40.800]  But to me, that's a great example of how accessibility is a mindset, and it really works for
[1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:44.320]  everybody. And it is amazing, because one of the first things that will happen when I go to any event,
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:47.360]  I imagine it somewhere for you is I get a bunch of people saying, please ask them before I
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:51.600]  sober still there, because accessibility is incredibly, is incredibly, is incredibly
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:56.000]  engaged, but they always feel like they don't really make Apple any money or companies in general,
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:00.240]  and they'll be the first thing that gets chopped if any deadlines get tight. So they're always,
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:03.120]  they're always really, really concerned that they're not going to be there.
[1:44:03.120 --> 1:44:08.640]  And they've seen it with other products. Yeah, absolutely. But you know, day one, Apple had voice
[1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:14.240]  over for the Apple TV, they had voice over for 3D touch on the iPhone, and I asked them about that.
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:17.520]  And they said, you know, that it's not even a point of pride for them. It's just they believe
[1:44:17.520 --> 1:44:21.120]  that it's something that has to be done, and they have teams of people making sure it gets done.
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:23.760]  Tell me, I don't know anything about voice over for 3D touch.
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:29.680]  So right now, if you press the 3D touch on it and you have voice over enabled, it'll tell you what it
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:33.280]  is, and then when it pops up, you can flick through and it'll read out to you the different option
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:36.880]  choices, for example, on a home screen icon, and then you can choose the one that you want,
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:41.120]  and that makes it accessible to people who can't see the actual 3D touch controls.
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:45.440]  Gotcha. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I'm not surprised, but that's really great.
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:56.480]  And, you know, the serious responsiveness in the hands-on demo area was as good as shown on stage.
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:00.480]  I mean, I was completely uncreative and just did the same thing they did.
[1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:05.200]  I mean, perhaps it wasn't a good test, but I did the, you know, show me some James Bond movies.
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:10.000]  I did show me episodes of the talk show where Malta is a guest and got like 300 results.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:18.720]  That's a pretty good one, but I saw other people doing other ones, you know, I forget what other
[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:25.920]  ones, you know, show me action movies, only the new ones, and stuff like that worked and, you know,
[1:45:25.920 --> 1:45:34.640]  okay, it's, you know, it's not going to make a truly magical upgrade year over year.
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:41.120]  Siri isn't going to suddenly become Hal from 2001, but it does seem like it's getting better,
[1:45:41.120 --> 1:45:46.080]  and it does seem like the Apple TV team in particular has somehow figured out a way to
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:51.840]  get it even better than the other platforms were series available.
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:55.360]  Well, my understanding, I might be wrong, is that the Siri team was still doing like a lot
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:46:00.080]  of this work, and it was delivered to the Apple TV team, but just in general, that team,
[1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:03.120]  because Siri is one of those things where the first time he tried it seems magical,
[1:46:03.120 --> 1:46:06.560]  but when you do have problems, you just often get it, I'm not using it again.
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:09.520]  And they have to be really careful because they don't have that many shots to make it
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:13.760]  a permanent part of your workflow. But with this, Siri does this thing called, if you
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:17.280]  weren't familiar with it, sequential inference where when you say something and then you say
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.840]  something else, it bases its answer not on the thing you most recently said, but on the context
[1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:25.360]  of the history going back to when you first started talking to it, and they were doing that,
[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:28.880]  you know, show me James Bond movies, only show me the new ones, only show me the ones with
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:35.120]  Sean Connery, only show me the ones with this or that guest art, and they could keep up with
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:40.640]  the context, and it could both reduce the amount of options and increase them in a way that really
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:44.320]  seemed like you were talking to somebody, and that to me was the most impressive thing,
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:48.320]  just the way it could do such fast set sorting and give you a result that was what you wanted.
[1:46:48.320 --> 1:47:00.000]  Yeah. Another thing, again, something that's not, you know, go back seven seconds is a feature,
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.960]  I never occurred to me because it just seemed too good to be true. Now that I've seen it,
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:06.880]  I can't wait to have it. Some of the features though that they have are things that we've all
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:12.400]  wanted since forever, like Universal Search, where if you know you want to see Caddy Shack,
[1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:16.560]  you say, show me Caddy Shack, and you have a Netflix subscription and you may be of HBO,
[1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:22.640]  show me if Caddy Shack is available for me, so I don't even have to pay anything to get it,
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:26.800]  because it's already on Netflix, and show it in one place, don't make me go into Netflix and search
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:33.040]  there, then go to HBO, then go to iTunes. There it is. Now they've done it.
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:35.840]  This is one of those things where it really does suck to be Apple. It's almost like,
[1:47:36.720 --> 1:47:39.760]  because people have been asking for this for years, and Apple wanted to do it for years,
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:45.200]  and the media companies would not let them, they did not want to be reduced to one of many options
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:50.000]  on a TV set, and it's almost like when they gave Amazon MP DRM free music and wouldn't give it
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:54.560]  to Apple. Once in a while, Apple not only does not get what they want, but gets the opposite
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:57.920]  of what they want, and I don't know how they ended up getting this deal, but when you see it,
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:02.400]  and you start asking for those things, and it just works, and the media companies can't be
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:06.240]  completely happy about that, because it does reduce them to a commodity, and they can't be happy
[1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:10.080]  about skipping around, and all these things, but Apple was able to do it, and to me that makes
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:16.240]  just a much better experience. Yeah, but I think that in some ways, maybe they sold it to them
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:25.040]  on the merits of the user experience, and especially if you're a Netflix subscriber, if you're not,
[1:48:25.040 --> 1:48:28.480]  you're not going to get those results anyway, because you don't have Netflix. If you are a
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:35.360]  Netflix subscriber, and you want to see a certain movie, why wouldn't you, if the results from
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:43.440]  Siri say, okay, you can get it from iTunes, and it'll be $1.99 or $0.99 or $3.99 or you can just hit
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:47.760]  play on Netflix. Why wouldn't you just hit play on Netflix? I believe they're doing it with
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:52.000]  part, not everyone has access to the search on Apple TV. I think you use that still partner program
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:49:02.480]  based. It's definitely a partner based. For example, if and when Amazon submits and Amazon
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:08.400]  Prime Video app to the App Store, just because they've submitted the app, the content of it won't
[1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:14.480]  necessarily, won't just show up magically. Those universal results are limited to partners.
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:20.080]  But I really can't see in the modern world where they wouldn't want to partner with that.
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:25.440]  And how many other places are there where you could see it if it's the same movie or TV show?
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:31.440]  How likely is it going to be, because HBO usually has a rotation. This month, these are the
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:39.840]  movies HBO has. And so, sure, maybe sometime there's going to be a movie that's available on both
[1:49:39.840 --> 1:49:45.120]  Netflix and HBO. And so, you, the person who just did the query are going to pick one and you
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:49.920]  wouldn't pick the other. But who's to say you wouldn't have searched in the one you picked first
[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:54.960]  anyway, right? In which case, you still wouldn't be giving them the play. And ultimately, what
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:50:00.160]  Netflix really wants is you to just remain a subscriber. I mean, whether you watch, you know,
[1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:05.520]  smoking in the bandit on HBO instead of watching it on Netflix doesn't cost them any money if
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:11.360]  you're still paying your monthly bill. And lastly, I think they all seem to know that the future
[1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:19.360]  for these services is their exclusive stuff. What's made HBO HBO is HBO exclusive shows like
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:24.720]  Game of Thrones and True Detective. And what's keeping Netflix relevant? What's keeping, what's
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:30.080]  making Netflix more popular than ever? It's the Netflix original content. And when you
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:34.240]  search for that original content, wouldn't you, why wouldn't you want it to show up? If you just
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:40.720]  ask Siri, you know, show me, you know, what's the Kevin Spacey one? How's the cards? How's the
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:45.680]  cards? Show me how's the cards? Why wouldn't you want that to show up as just universal search
[1:50:45.680 --> 1:50:49.120]  wherever you are? I think the fact that they know that the stuff that's most important for you
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:53.200]  to find from them is their exclusive stuff, which you're not, you can't find anywhere else.
[1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.840]  It changes the dynamics of why they would want to be involved in that.
[1:50:57.840 --> 1:51:02.720]  Yeah, the entire thing is changing. Sometimes it's frustratingly slow, but I think absolutely,
[1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:05.760]  at a certain point, they're going to be exclusive data. And that's more important than being
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:09.600]  an exclusive interface. Yeah. And I think if there's anybody who maybe wouldn't want to be
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:15.600]  involved in it for a nickel and diming from a nickel and diming angle, it would be Apple in terms of
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:21.520]  if your option would be to rent it from Apple. And this is right now speaking before any sort
[1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:25.440]  of hypothetical streaming package that they might offer in the future. But as of today, as of
[1:51:25.440 --> 1:51:32.320]  when we first get our first Apple new Apple TVs later, later this year, if there's a movie that
[1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:38.160]  they have for rent, but Netflix has it or HBO has it. And you're a Netflix and HBO subscriber.
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:41.440]  It's going to cost Apple money because you're not going to rent it. You're going to go watch the
[1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:45.520]  copy of it. You can see for free. Well, to your point, though, I mean, they're their biggest deal
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:50.000]  now is the early access things where you can get, for example, Age of Ultron or something else
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:54.320]  weeks before any other service. And yes, it's full price. But if you want it badly enough, you can have it.
[1:51:54.320 --> 1:51:58.960]  Well, and ultimately, I think it just gets to the usual Apple mantra of that the first, you know,
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:02.640]  let's just make it awesome. Let's make an awesome experience and we'll worry about, you know,
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:07.040]  we'll get our money eventually. But we don't have to make every single $3 that we have,
[1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:12.400]  you know, at a time that we theoretically get. If people are going to be happy using Netflix on
[1:52:12.400 --> 1:52:17.440]  Apple TV, good. Yeah, they would absolutely rather you have an Apple TV than you, they worry about who
[1:52:17.440 --> 1:52:21.920]  you're going to rent something from. Yeah. So we still haven't even talked about the iPhones.
[1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:27.600]  I know. It's such a long show with so much to cover.
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:31.920]  iPhone six. Yes. Yes.
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:37.920]  I heard there's anything, anything surprising.
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:44.000]  No, I like Apple's tagline because every year they get shit for you. Oh, it's exactly the same
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:47.840]  as the last one, which is the same with a 911. Every Nokia phone is the same for years. Every
[1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:52.000]  HTC phone, every Samsung, they have, I mean, they're phones. And this year they sort of turned
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.040]  that around and really said nothing has changed except for everything. And I thought that was a
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:59.440]  good wink and nod to that meme. And I really liked the commercial, the way that the commercial
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:06.880]  just takes that reaction square on and even starts with it, even really starts and with the narrator,
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:12.720]  Lake Bell really isn't, she's not, she doesn't sound sarcastic. She really sounds like she's going
[1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:18.240]  with the idea that there's not much of it's new. And then starts telling you everything that's new.
[1:53:19.200 --> 1:53:26.720]  Ultimately, I don't know. My take is that if anything, if you're on a two year upgrade cycle,
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:30.400]  if you get a new iPhone every two years, which is totally sensible, it's a lot more sensible
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:35.600]  than the get one, everyone that comes out upgrade cycle that I'm on. I mean, you know, like,
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:43.760]  of course, I think it's totally sensible. I think in general, you're better off on the S cycle. Yes,
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:49.120]  I think that the S upgrades are often the ones that have the more stuff. I think it was the
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:55.280]  five S that invented touch that not invented, but brought touch ID to us. Yeah, 4S was Siri,
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:54:01.120]  3S was the new chipset in video recording. Yeah, and some of the performance upgrades really
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:07.280]  seem most noticeable. And that goes back to the original S, the 3G S, the 3G S was a huge upgrade,
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:13.920]  maybe in hindsight, and it's hard to rate these things because it's largely an iterative process.
[1:54:13.920 --> 1:54:18.480]  And it's been so close to annual that you really, we've been hearing these complaints
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:26.720]  ever since the 3G, I mean, honestly, the first second, you know, the second iPhone ever made.
[1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:33.680]  Well, it's now it's plastic and all they did was add 3G. And every single year since then,
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:38.400]  some of the same people have been complaining that this is not a major upgrade. And yet, here we are,
[1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:45.440]  you know, eight years later, and we have this phone instead of the original iPhone, and it's,
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:49.600]  you know, it's almost incomprehensible how much better it is. I mean, every year is like that,
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:56.560]  it's incremental in some ways. But I think in general, some of the more impressive engineering
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:03.680]  stuff comes on the S-year cycles, when they can work within the design constraints of the previous year.
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:08.000]  Yeah, it seems oftentimes, and I guess it depends on what department you're in, that your chief
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:12.800]  challenge in the redesign years is to get all your stuff to fit in a new design, whether it's a camera
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:16.720]  or a processor, the thinner it's got, you know, more thermal constraint, and you've got to figure
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:20.160]  all that out. And then you've figured that out already. You've paid that tax. And the next year,
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:21.520]  you can just start racing ahead again.
[1:55:21.520 --> 1:55:26.960]  Right, that, you know, I think like the six obviously was about making it bigger, and that certainly
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:32.240]  is some engineering involved. But all of the technologies were the same as the technologies
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:37.360]  that were there before. And it's the S-year model that comes with 3D touch.
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:43.680]  Yeah, and you always wonder what story, like to me, and I think we've talked about this before,
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:46.720]  to me what Apple is going to do is never that interesting. It's the same reason,
[1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:50.560]  like I don't want to know what's going to happen in the new Star Wars movie. I want to see how well
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:53.760]  they're going to realize it. If you just look at Phantom Menace on paper,
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:56.880]  you know, there's this character, that character, that tells you what's going to happen,
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.120]  but it doesn't tell you what the movie is going to be. And I want to see how Apple presents
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:04.720]  this stuff, like you hear about, you know, they use for such in the watch, they use it in the
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:08.400]  trackpad. They're going to use it in the phone, but how are they going to use it? And what
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:12.080]  difference is it going to make in me using the phone? That's always a super interesting part.
[1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:15.840]  And I dated way better with that than I thought they were going to do. They just made a really,
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:24.240]  a really well crafted story around 3D Touch for me. I think it's interesting that they've
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:30.640]  settled on this two-year cycle of industrial design. And it's been,
[1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:37.840]  other than the original iPhone, it has been, I mean, there's been no exceptions whatsoever.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:42.720]  So there's the original iPhone, which was like a one-off, then there was the 3G,
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:49.440]  then the 3G-S, which was exactly from the outside, you know, like the 3G, but, you know, with
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:54.560]  better internals than the four, then the four S, then the five, then the five S, six, six S.
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:01.920]  I, you know, again, you know, like I proved, you know, last week, you can definitely go wrong by
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.040]  expecting that Apple will keep doing in the future what it's done in the past. But for some reason,
[1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:11.360]  I feel like it really works for them here and that they've got this down and that it gives the
[1:57:11.360 --> 1:57:18.080]  industrial design team two years to come out with what's next and they're not scrambling every year.
[1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:28.000]  And I think it gives, you know, gives the ecosystem an extra year of like case compatibility.
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.440]  I know that there was some talk or speculation. I haven't even looked at the specs. I honestly
[1:57:33.440 --> 1:57:40.160]  don't even know, but that the six Xs are slightly like in terms of tenths of a millimeter
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:46.960]  thicker or something. But I asked and they are case compatible, like any case that was certified for
[1:57:46.960 --> 1:57:52.480]  your iPhone 6 should fit on a success. It was just like a super cheap case with no manufacturing
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:57.760]  tolerances at all. But that really, yeah, so there might be exceptions. But I think the ones,
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:02.960]  I think like, I don't know, to my knowledge, if there are exceptions, it would have to be something
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:08.880]  that is, you know, some kind of totally rigid thing. I don't know. Yeah, no, they're compatible.
[1:58:08.880 --> 1:58:13.600]  Within tolerance levels are completely compatible. And that's such a big deal for some of the things
[1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:19.360]  that like ecosystem wise are such a big advantage of being an iPhone user, like when you go to
[1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:27.440]  Disney World. And if you want to buy a case from Disney for your iPhone, the fact that
[1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:31.520]  they're all the ones they already have are going to fit the fun. Like if you buy a new phone,
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:35.680]  you know, now in September, you can just go there and all those cases that are in stars
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:40.320]  already work. It's a huge advantage. Yeah. And the manufacturers tell you exactly the same thing
[1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:44.240]  that they don't have to cut new cases every year. And also they don't have to try and cover
[1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:48.880]  nine or 10 different designs from the same company every year. Right. Yeah, I totally think so. And
[1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:53.280]  you know, and for example, so like for the engineering team working on 3D Touch, and who knows how
[1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:58.160]  many years they've been working on this, you know, a lot apparently, probably a lot. But they,
[1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:05.680]  you know, as soon as the hardware designed for the six and six S was set, a whole bunch of the
[1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:10.640]  constraints that they would have to know to worry about were set. And you know, yes, they made a
[1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:16.560]  change and they switched from whatever series aluminum to 7,000 series aluminum. And I'm sure there
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:20.320]  were all sorts of little things along the way where they got, you know, monkey wrenches thrown in
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:25.440]  works. But at a basic level, they knew the sizes of the devices that they would be working with.
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:32.160]  They knew the sizes of the displays. And, you know, and that's not like they knew that last year,
[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:37.040]  that's like they knew that two years ago because the design of the six and six six plus was set
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:42.640]  two years ago, a year in advance. You know, somewhere within Apple, there's a team that knows exactly
[1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:46.720]  what the iPhone 7 is going to look like next year. Yeah, if not further ahead. Yeah, it might have
[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:51.600]  been set might have been set months ago, because that's how far in advance some of this stuff has to go.
[1:59:51.600 --> 1:59:58.320]  Um, it's, you know, but I can only assume that that's, you know, the schedule that they're on,
[1:59:58.320 --> 2:00:02.800]  but I don't think there's any events. I just think it, it, as the years go on, I've always thought
[2:00:02.800 --> 2:00:07.760]  this, but I think as the years go on, you look more and more superficial. If you really are going to
[2:00:07.760 --> 2:00:13.280]  judge whether the iPhone is an improvement year over year just by whether the exterior design looks
[2:00:13.280 --> 2:00:16.800]  new. Yeah, I want to tweet that every year, just make a general reminder to people that,
[2:00:16.800 --> 2:00:19.840]  you know, we know who are reviewing these things that, you know, human beings aren't buying them
[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:24.800]  every year for a lot of people they're upgrading from a 4s of 5, a 5c, a 5s, and it's a, it's a
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:29.760]  substantial upgrade. And the really, the really funny thing is that Apple can do all this and people
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:34.320]  will say, oh, it's boring. It's not a big upgrade. And then they'll make it like gold or rose gold.
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:37.680]  And so they're flying off the shelves because it turns out you scratch our surface and what you
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:44.160]  find more surface. Yeah. Uh, well, speaking of that before we move on, um, what did you think of
[2:00:44.160 --> 2:00:50.400]  the new rose gold, uh, anodized aluminum? That's what I ordered. Did you really? Yeah. Wow. I,
[2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:55.040]  I try to get the new color because it, I, I floated out these things a lot and it, it's a very
[2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:58.800]  monotonous page when everything is the same color. So I wish I had to get whatever new is available
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:02.000]  because it livens things up. But I was interested. I wasn't sure if it was going to be because
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  usually rose gold is much more copyright than this. And this is really much more rose than it is
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:12.400]  gold. Hmm. Uh, and the watch matches and it, it, it's, it's different. It's a very different
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:17.040]  direction for Apple. That was one of the things I was interested in is I know that the,
[2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:23.680]  the watch started them with the 7,000 series aluminum. Um, and now the phone is on it and talking
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:27.280]  to them. And it's one of those questions where they're not kind of quite give you a complete answer,
[2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:31.280]  but, you know, like a wink, wink, no judge answer. Is it the same aluminum? And it's like,
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.960]  yeah, it's the same aluminum. Um, it's, you know, and, and it's the same metallurgy teams working
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:42.160]  hand in hand and, and, and so looking at, I was looking at the watch that the rose gold watch at
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:46.800]  the event last week. And it's under that, like I said, this really nice lighting, like really
[2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:51.680]  nice. I mean, you just cannot believe it's not sunlight lighting, like nice and diffuse and seemingly
[2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:58.800]  a very, very, you know, neutral color. Um, and the guy from Apple at the desk, I was like,
[2:01:58.800 --> 2:02:01.600]  what would you, you know, what do you have a question? I was like, I'm just curious how well it
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:06.000]  matches the, the phone, you know, the rose gold phone, but the phones were at another table and you
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.080]  can't just walk around with these things. And he goes, oh, you want to see it. And like they had,
[2:02:10.080 --> 2:02:13.200]  they were ready for that. And they're, you know, he had a little key and he could unlock a drawer
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:17.120]  right there. And even at the watch table, he could take out a rose gold phone and, and put it
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:22.320]  side by side for me. And I, I mean, I got really close. I got as close as I could. And I mean,
[2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:28.640]  those things are identical. I mean, it's far beyond the capabilities of my vision to notice any
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:33.280]  difference in the color. Yeah, I got a photo, I asked them if they could hold it up for me,
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:36.480]  and I got a photo of them together. And they were, it's hard to see from the picture, but they
[2:02:36.480 --> 2:02:41.520]  were so, yeah, so very similar. But, and there's a, almost a running joke, the, the space
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:45.680]  grays have not always matched. Like they've changed over the years because black is the hardest
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:49.680]  color to anodize. And if you try to make it really black, it chips and it flakes. So you go down
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:52.560]  to gray and then maybe you get a little bit better at it. And like with the watch, they could make
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:56.480]  it darker again. It does that hold up on a phone. So that's, that's always a moving target.
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:03:00.640]  But I'm understanding as gold is the easiest color. And some of these variations are much easier to
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:09.440]  just nail time after time. Yeah. Um, and I, when I was in the, I mean, this is the worst type
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:13.920]  of evidence. It's an anecdote of one. But, um, what, what happened was, I think it was, was it
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.800]  yesterday a Monday? Well, one of the last two days, I was walking, uh, my son home from school.
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:27.840]  And I know he's really interested in the, the product red strap, a sports strap. Um, so I said,
[2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:30.880]  well, let's, you know, swing by the Apple store on the way home. It's a beautiful day. Let's
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:34.560]  walk by and go in and look and we went and looked and, you know, not for sale yet, but they were
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:39.760]  there on the day. And while we were there, Guy came in and, uh, he wanted to see the rose gold watch.
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:45.360]  Um, and it, you know, so anecdote of one, they said the new color seemed popular.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:50.320]  Yeah. I mean, that's just it because we do respond. We, it's bought, we respond to some form of
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:54.240]  individualization when everybody has the same color watch. You start to feel like if you get something
[2:03:54.240 --> 2:04:00.320]  different, it's, it's just a little bit more your own. Yeah. Uh, and I, you know, again, I don't,
[2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:08.320]  I think it's interesting that it's, I, I think that the silver, silver back and white face watch,
[2:04:08.320 --> 2:04:13.280]  and I think, you know, is, is truly, I think all of them are, but at my point is, I think they're
[2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:19.440]  all relatively gender neutral colors. I think that the rose gold is going to skew a little bit
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:25.360]  more towards women. And I think space black probably, and watch phone, all devices probably
[2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:30.000]  skews a little bit more towards men. But even at those extremes, I don't think it's,
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:35.760]  I don't think it's that far from 50 50, you know, if you talk to any, I've talked to all the
[2:04:35.760 --> 2:04:39.840]  manufacturers over the years, and they will always tell you that black is by far the biggest seller
[2:04:39.840 --> 2:04:43.840]  because it's cliched as it sounds. It is a little black shirt, a little black dress. It's the
[2:04:43.840 --> 2:04:48.320]  one thing that you get that goes with everything. And people just tend to go that way because not,
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:51.440]  you want to dress it up or you want to do something else or you don't want people to notice it.
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:55.120]  And the flashy colors, they get a lot of attention, but they're never high sellers.
[2:04:55.120 --> 2:05:01.920]  Yeah, I think, um, I think that maybe if there's, if there's a sport band that maybe skews
[2:05:01.920 --> 2:05:06.480]  specifically towards women, it's the rose gold with the, I think they're calling it lavender.
[2:05:06.480 --> 2:05:13.520]  Yeah, they have several is, is probably, you know, pretty feminine. But I guess the way I would put
[2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:18.960]  it is even the ones that skew a little feminine don't skew girly. None of them look at, you know,
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:22.880]  I mean, like in terms of linguistics that there's a difference to me between what's feminine and
[2:05:22.880 --> 2:05:26.560]  what's girly. And this stuff doesn't look girly. It looks feminine.
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:30.720]  No, the entire puck line, like it's not childish in any way that everything from the blue,
[2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:35.360]  like nothing is boyish either. Everything is sort of, it's not like a, it's not a gold gold,
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:41.600]  uh, phone. It's not a hot pink phone. Everything has sort of this layer of, uh, not conserved as
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:48.160]  an artwork, but just a restraint on it. Um, I don't think what else. I guess the only other thing
[2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:52.320]  I can think of right off the top of my head to cover with the iPhone 6 and success and success
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:56.720]  plus would be the live pictures feature that. And I was really impressed with the camera.
[2:05:56.720 --> 2:06:01.520]  That was a big question to me. Yeah. Well, and, and you know, I guess they're semi related. It's,
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:06.720]  um, you know, there were a lot of arguments last weekend at Exo Exo, um, about whether live
[2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:12.320]  pictures are, are a new thing or whether they're, they're just videos.
[2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:15.920]  There were just, I mean, phones have been doing like, uh, I just have this ongoing joke that
[2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:19.840]  Nokia invented everything in 1812. Cause they've been live pictures on Windows phone and
[2:06:19.840 --> 2:06:24.160]  they've been live pictures on HTC phones before. But whoever, the inventing it first is like
[2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:28.320]  who's being first in a comment section on the internet first first is who makes it successful.
[2:06:28.320 --> 2:06:34.880]  That really matters. It reminds me of the, uh, the photos in the daily profit in the
[2:06:34.880 --> 2:06:41.440]  horror world. It's, uh, you know, I don't know. There's still, but those were visually impressive
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:46.080]  when you saw the movies. Oh, definitely. Uh, they're also visually impressive at Universal Studios
[2:06:46.080 --> 2:06:49.040]  when you look at the, when you go through the rides down there. And I don't know what you
[2:06:49.040 --> 2:06:52.640]  heard, but when I was talking to Apple, they were very careful not to call them videos, but to
[2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:56.400]  say that these are still photos being taken in quick succession and then animated. Like they didn't
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:07:00.560]  want to make it sound like they were just doing a quick video. It wasn't some, wasn't even so
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:03.920]  much that they wouldn't say that their videos is that if you called them videos, they would,
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:08.960]  they would say no, they're not videos. These are live photos and, you know, videos are videos and
[2:07:08.960 --> 2:07:17.840]  these are live photos. These are 12 megapixels. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I think the camera is impressive
[2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:22.000]  too, but that's the sort of thing that's really hard to tell from their demos and, and you certainly
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.320]  can't take any pictures in the hands-on area that, that prove anything. But the interesting thing
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:31.040]  to me was that when you generally, a lot of times when you take a camera and you add megapixels,
[2:07:31.040 --> 2:07:35.120]  a, a lazy company will just cut up the sensor and just smaller and smaller bits and then you get
[2:07:35.120 --> 2:07:38.720]  less and less light. You know, those pixels and you get shit at your pictures. They just, they,
[2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:43.200]  they are noisy and there's not a lot of fine grain detail. And yes, you can still crop them and
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:47.920]  digitally zoom them, but you're dealing with bad data and Apple went to a lot of like they did not,
[2:07:47.920 --> 2:07:51.840]  the iPhone cameras always been about making really, really smart compromises on aperture and
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:56.400]  sensor size and all these things. And I was happy they kept doing it. They didn't just capitulate
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:08:00.480]  and say, we'll make, we'll put an 18 megapixel or 30 megapixel lens on here.
[2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:04.000]  They made, they went to 12, but they did, you know, and Phil showed her kind of made fun of
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:09.040]  himself, but they did do the deep trench isolation, which, you know, only the Death Star had with
[2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:14.720]  Empire's still being business, but it's a good joke. But they did that so that you don't get the
[2:08:14.720 --> 2:08:18.720]  color bleeding. You don't get the noise and it makes for really, they think the sample pictures
[2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:22.480]  and they said they were genuine and they're always very honest about that. Those sample pictures
[2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:26.160]  in low, not just low light, but when you had a light source in the middle or on the size and
[2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:30.480]  in otherwise low light setting, they look spectacular. Yeah. And it really does seem like the color
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:35.760]  balancing that they're doing is really the tone that they're getting off the sensor is extraordinary.
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.000]  So I'm super, you know, always super excited about it. And it's, if there's any way that I can
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:48.720]  justify, uh, in a logical sense, my bio new iPhone every year, it's the ever increasing quality of
[2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:55.360]  the camera and the ever increasing proportion of the photos I take every year that I take with my
[2:08:55.360 --> 2:09:00.560]  iPhone. Like buying a new iPhone every year is, you know, is going to make the pictures I take on
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:05.840]  my family in the year 2016, uh, better than they would be if I didn't. And that's what I like.
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:09.200]  It's that goal. I think their goal is not to do a bunch of crazy stuff. Their goal is that you
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:13.280]  take the phone from your pocket and you snap something that's important to you. And the,
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:17.040]  the better chance you have of getting a great shot is the bet is what they're going to focus on.
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:23.120]  Their ambitions and photography are, are boundless. There, there is no limit to it. There is no good
[2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:30.880]  for, uh, good for a phone sort of mindset. They're, their goal and, you know, in their mind,
[2:09:30.880 --> 2:09:35.440]  I think internally, they still feel like the, the camera in the iPhone's success and success plus
[2:09:35.440 --> 2:09:41.920]  is shitty. That their, their goals are so far ahead for where they want to get to. And I feel
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:46.800]  like that's, that's sort of doggedness is what you need to get the sort of iterative improvements
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:50.480]  that we're getting every year. They consider themselves a camera company. Oh, absolutely.
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:55.360]  Shiller said it on stage with me at the show. I said one, I said, one of, you know, do you,
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:09:59.040]  do you consider yourselves one of the leading camera companies in the world and he said the leading
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:03.280]  camera company? You know, I mean, he was, I think it was the only time in the whole interview where
[2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:08.560]  he was sort of bragged a little bit. And they're like the chips. They will spend boundless amounts of
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:11.440]  money because they don't make money on the camera. They make it on the entire iPhone and that
[2:10:11.440 --> 2:10:15.520]  affords them the luxury of deeply investing in these technologies. Yeah, it's really, really
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:21.280]  interesting. Anything else on the phone? I don't want to, I want to, I want to get to iOS nine.
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:25.760]  So I'd rather, we can talk like interesting wireless and stuff. But yeah, yeah, we can talk about
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:30.000]  that detail later. I want to do one more sponsor and I want to talk to you about iOS nine.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:36.160]  And our last sponsor, another one of our good friends by which I mean a returning sponsor
[2:10:37.440 --> 2:10:43.920]  is our friends at Casper. You guys know Casper, Casper sells obsessively engineered mattresses
[2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:49.520]  at shockingly fair prices, just the right sink, just the right bounce. That's their slogan.
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:55.680]  So how are they made? They have two, two technologies for modern mattresses, latex foam and memory foam
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:11:01.120]  and they put them together for a better night, better night's sleep memory foam in particular.
[2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:06.160]  That's the one that you kind of sink into and it forms a shape data. It's not just pure memory
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:09.600]  foam because pure memory foam really bothers a lot of people. You really kind of sink into it.
[2:11:09.600 --> 2:11:13.440]  A lot of people think it's hot because you just sort of end up like almost submerged in the thing.
[2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:19.040]  And the fact that you get up and it doesn't just return to foam. So they mix memory foam
[2:11:19.040 --> 2:11:23.040]  technology with latex foam and it's just one thing. And so you don't, that's one of the things
[2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:27.200]  I really like about this too with Casper. It's really all you do with Casper is you pick what size
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:31.520]  mattress you want and then they just send you the one with their, their, just the right sink,
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:36.800]  just the right bounce mixture of foam. So you don't like pick, all right, I want a queen sized bed
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:40.880]  and then you got a pick between like small, medium, large, squishiness or something like that.
[2:11:41.920 --> 2:11:48.160]  Which A, I would bother me in any case and B would be, how in the world would you do that online?
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:52.560]  So they just do it right. They've spent tons of time, this, I mean, the whole company is really
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:58.560]  built around the foam that they make these mattresses out of. And they're the experts. They know more
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:06.240]  than I do about foam. And, you know, what you think feels better in like a two minute test in a
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:10.640]  store where you're laying on a mattress that a lot of other people have laid on it is really gross.
[2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:15.680]  But what you think in two minutes on a mattress has nothing to do with what you, what's actually
[2:12:15.680 --> 2:12:22.000]  going to be good for you for like years of sleeping, eight or nine hours, or if you're me,
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:28.800]  10 or 11 hours a night. They just do it right. Now buying a mattress online, crazy, right? Because
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:33.120]  how you're going to buy a mattress if you've never even like jumped on it or or squished on it.
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:39.200]  Here's the thing, it's risk free, right? You just, you buy this thing. You send them, they send it to
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:45.120]  you. You get to sleep on it for up to a hundred days. And it's with free delivery. And after
[2:12:45.120 --> 2:12:48.880]  up to a hundred days, if you don't like it, if you think it's not a good mattress, you know
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:54.400]  that it was worth the money, painless free return, just send it back to them. The mattresses are
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:13:00.720]  made in America. And the prices are just unbelievable. I think most mattresses, top notch mattresses
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:06.000]  with good technology. They're all over a thousand dollars, maybe $2,000. Here's their prices.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:12.400]  500 bucks for a twin size mattress, 950 for a king size mattress. And the other sizes are, you know,
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:16.880]  right where you would think in between 500 and 950. Compare that to the industry averages.
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.600]  Go out there. I dare you to find a better deal. It's an outstanding price point. They make this
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:26.080]  happen by just getting rid of the middle people. There are no by just selling them to you direct.
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:31.840]  They make them. They sell them to you. It gets rid of all the middlemen. There's no markup in between.
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  Really, really great price points. I keep hearing from people. This is one of the sponsors of
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:40.640]  the show that gets the most responses from people like on Twitter and stuff like that that say,
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:45.520]  I've been, it sounds crazy to buy a mattress online, but I did it. I trust Gruber,
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:50.320]  wow, this mattress is great. And it was the easiest mattress I've ever bought because man,
[2:13:50.320 --> 2:13:57.360]  buy a mattress the old fashioned way. It's a pain in the ass. Here's the URL. Go to casper.com
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:05.120]  slash the talk show. Go to casper.com slash the talk show. That's the promo code. And not only
[2:14:05.120 --> 2:14:10.240]  well, they know you came from the show, but you'll save 50 bucks towards any mattress.
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:17.360]  So those prices I quoted, you'll save 50 bucks. You'll get a king size mattress for 900 bucks.
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:20.880]  So go there. Use the code, the talk show. And if you need a mattress, keep them in mind.
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:27.200]  All right, iOS nine, man, we really left a lot of time for this. Luckily, here's the thing.
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:31.680]  The reason I wanted you on this week, I've read your review. You were nice enough to give me
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:39.680]  advanced access to it. Really, really comprehensive. Again, just like the phone itself,
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:44.240]  you can say looking at iOS nine, wow, this doesn't look that, like that big a deal you're over
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:50.240]  here. You I read your review and really dig into everything that's new. And it almost seems,
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:55.120]  it just seems like it's too much year over year. Like not too much, like it's overwhelming the
[2:14:55.120 --> 2:14:59.920]  user, but too much. I can't believe Apple pulled off all of this. Yeah, I mean, I thought I was in
[2:14:59.920 --> 2:15:03.520]  for an easy year, because like the rumor was they punted a lot of stuff till the future. And even
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:08.480]  if that's the case, they're, I just kept writing and it wasn't that I wanted to write this much
[2:15:08.480 --> 2:15:12.320]  about it. I would have much preferred to, you know, go to Vegas or something. But this it,
[2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:16.080]  there was just so much in it. And it was so much stuff that wasn't really apparent, because when
[2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:22.480]  they gave the list that 10 pole list, that new notes app, new news app, smarter Siri, but when
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.960]  you start digging into it, I mean, they didn't even put content blockers up on stage. That was all
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:31.920]  in the sessions. There is so much just incredibly interesting technology and things that really
[2:15:31.920 --> 2:15:36.480]  make the experience. It seems like they're really focused on performance, but not just how fast
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:41.440]  a processor goes, but how fast you can move around the system and how enjoyable that experience is.
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:48.800]  This is, that's a most common question I've been getting today from people is, and it makes sense.
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:52.720]  It's because everybody out there who hasn't been running the beta over summer, which is smart,
[2:15:53.200 --> 2:15:57.760]  now has the option of upgrading. And they already have a phone and their phone is working. Okay,
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:02.960]  pretty good. And they're worried. I think, and it makes sense. The biggest worry people have
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:08.400]  is they're going to upgrade to iOS 9 and it's going to feel slow. I ran it all summer long,
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:17.120]  and not since WWC like you, but I upgraded to 9 on my daily carry iPhone 6 at some point in July,
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:24.480]  so it was about a month after it came out and never once regretted it. I found, so that,
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:30.400]  again, your mileage may vary out there. I found that it was as fast or faster. There was never a
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:36.320]  point where I thought I saw animation stuttering that didn't stutter before. It felt pretty good.
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:40.160]  And in fact, I would have to say that for betas, especially for ones that I was running since
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:45.040]  July, I found the whole OS to be remarkably stable. The one thing that I always point out to people
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:48.800]  is that when you first download and you first install a new version of iOS, there's so much
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:53.040]  that's going on internally. It's, you know, updating libraries. It's migrating data. It's
[2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:56.880]  re-indexing all the spotlight stuff, especially this year with all the new spotlight thing,
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:00.480]  that it is going to be operating as fast as it can for a while. And it's going to be using
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:04.560]  the radios are going to be on and the process is going to be on. And it may not be the best
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:08.400]  experience, but give it that day, give it that data update, and then sort of make up your mind.
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:14.240]  Yeah. Like just because it's let you restart and log in and go through the, you know, the little
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:18.480]  welcome, you know, thing that you go through when you do a major update. Doesn't mean that it's
[2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:23.200]  done with everything. Yeah. Yeah. Did you find that? Do you find it to be as fast or faster?
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:28.000]  I find it to be better. And I did some tests with one of the betas on an iPhone 4S, and it was
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.360]  very good. I don't, I want to do it on the release version. I've got a chance yet because that
[2:17:31.360 --> 2:17:36.080]  to me is a really honest test and let you install it, let it wait a day and then try everything on it.
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:41.840]  But Apple seemed especially laser focused after last year to make the, the ability to install
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:45.760]  and run iOS even better. So they're shedding a lot of things that don't need to be on older
[2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:49.360]  devices. They're even shedding features when, you know, people would like every feature,
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:53.760]  but some of them don't make sense on lower powered, the lower processor powered devices. And they're
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:57.840]  doing all that. They're, they thin down the OS to one gigabyte. They're doing all the app thinning
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:02.000]  stuff. They are, they really want, because they have relatives. I think you've said this, they have
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:05.760]  relatives who are running these devices and they want that to be a great experience. And they want
[2:18:05.760 --> 2:18:10.080]  people to update to another iPhone. They don't have to get pissed off and go to another phone.
[2:18:10.080 --> 2:18:15.120]  So it really behooves them to get all this right. Yeah. I think one of the things that I think most
[2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:20.240]  annoys people in Apple from Tim Cook, I think down, but especially to the people who work on this
[2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:26.720]  stuff is that really annoys them that there's, there's this widespread belief that Apple purposefully
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:31.920]  makes a new version of iOS, make your old films slow, old phone feels slow so that you'll upgrade
[2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:36.880]  to a new phone right away. People Google iPhone slow at peak velocity, because every single
[2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:41.520]  iPhone in the world is updated on the same day where every Android phone is updated on other days,
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:46.800]  so they Google that over an entire year. It doesn't peak. And, and that's not to say that it hasn't
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:51.040]  happened. That's not to say that there haven't been iOS updates that have performed disappointingly
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:57.600]  on old hardware. And, and especially if you're maybe two years behind, and there's the, hey,
[2:18:57.600 --> 2:19:04.080]  isn't Apple, the one angle is, isn't it great that Apple supports so many years back of iPhone models
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:10.160]  as opposed to Android where, you know, this year's new version of Android, you know, it often,
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:15.440]  it's only is, you know, available on phones going back one year. But the flip side of that is that
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:22.240]  there have been some releases where the lowest supported phone, especially performance worse than that.
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:30.080]  And, you know, it, it is what it is, and whether that's a mistake or not, or it's strategically on
[2:19:30.080 --> 2:19:33.760]  Apple's part, but the people, you know, who hear it, they're, they're nothing but disappointed in
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:39.600]  themselves for it. They really are. And they, and they really do, their interest is not in selling,
[2:19:39.600 --> 2:19:45.440]  or their primary interest is not in selling this year's new phone right now to as many people as
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:51.520]  possible. Their interest is in making as many people as possible. Happy and satisfied iPhone customers
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:56.320]  so that their next phone whenever they buy it will be an iPhone. And that one way that the easiest
[2:19:56.320 --> 2:20:03.360]  way they could burn through that is by making people think things like, hey, Apple is just trying
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:07.760]  to screw you with the iOS updates, you know, and make your phone feel slow. Yeah, when I heard
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:10.880]  they were going to support everything that iOS 8 supported, I felt that they were probably pretty
[2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:15.120]  confident that they've got this under control. Yeah, I think so. I have heard, and I don't
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:19.200]  maybe they even announced this. I don't even know if that, I don't know why they would. But I,
[2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:25.760]  going back to WWE, you see, I had heard that they were doing a lot more, you know, have engineers
[2:20:25.760 --> 2:20:30.800]  actually carry older phones for some period of time during development or for whatever they're
[2:20:30.800 --> 2:20:37.520]  working on. And so that it's not just like, oh, go install it on an iPhone 5 and run a few tests
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:42.720]  and see if it's all right. But, you know, have, you know, do some serious dog fooding on older
[2:20:42.720 --> 2:20:48.400]  iPhones themselves just to sort of keep themselves honest. No better motivator in the world.
[2:20:48.400 --> 2:20:51.760]  I don't know if that's true though, because I mean, how do you find the volunteers to do that?
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:04.960]  What is going on? This isn't something even having read your review. I'm not 100% sure on. So
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  with the new notes app, the new note app is a major, major update. It really does, like you say,
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:16.080]  like you previously used Apple's built in notes as sort of a, and it's exactly how I've used it
[2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:22.560]  for a long time as a multi device, multi platform clipboard, where for a couple of pieces of text
[2:21:22.560 --> 2:21:26.880]  or URLs or something like that, something where even like handoff isn't quite what you want,
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:31.760]  because you want to do it later or something. Yes. Just put something here, and then I know from
[2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:35.840]  there, you know, whether I'm on my phone or whether I'm on my Mac, I can put something there.
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:40.320]  And then later, when I'm on something else, I can go and I know where it is and I can get it.
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:43.280]  And then I can usually, I just delete them, you know, it's little temporary things.
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:48.960]  And that notes now, the built in note app is now a serious note tap, and it's got,
[2:21:50.400 --> 2:21:56.880]  you know, a lot more pages like features with titles and headings and stuff like that and styles
[2:21:56.880 --> 2:22:04.960]  and built in checklists and a lot more features related to image attachments. And you can do doodles
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:09.520]  in them now too. Yeah. And they even, and that's pressure sounds that I've on a success, which is really
[2:22:09.520 --> 2:22:17.440]  nice. It's crazy. Yeah. But I don't, I don't see that yet. And I think it's because I haven't
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:22.640]  hit the upgrade button. Is that right? Is that, that's the, that's the thing you have to do to get
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:27.520]  those new features. And, and the, the, the hitch with the upgrade button is it's sort of like
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:33.440]  you're going from the old notes to the new notes. And when you go to the new notes, the,
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:38.080]  the biggest thing is that syncing only takes place through iCloud Drive. And they're,
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:46.080]  it's no longer doing that hack that use based on IMAP folders. Yes. But the hitch is, once you've
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:51.600]  done it, you've kind of got a, you know, you got to get everything on the latest and greatest.
[2:22:51.600 --> 2:22:56.560]  And the thing I've been putting off and probably will put off for a while is upgrading my max to
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:23:01.520]  El Capitan. Yeah. It's because they still don't really, and I don't want them to release everything
[2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:04.960]  on the same day. But every year now, we're having this thing where, where half of something is
[2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:09.120]  ready on iOS and September. And then you have to wait till October to have the other half of it.
[2:23:09.120 --> 2:23:13.120]  Like I think it was iCloud Drive last year. And it was something else the year before.
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:17.840]  Yeah. So if anybody out there is, is, is confused. And I thought I had the story, but I just wanted
[2:23:17.840 --> 2:23:21.680]  to make sure with you. But if anybody's out there is confused why they can't put doodles in their
[2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:27.120]  notes, even after they upgrade to iOS 9, it's, it's because you're like me and you didn't do
[2:23:27.120 --> 2:23:30.560]  this upgrade. Which they're very clear about. They, once you upgrade this, then the syncing you'll
[2:23:30.560 --> 2:23:34.800]  meet, you'll need your max on El Capitan to do the syncing. And, you know, if you're not,
[2:23:34.800 --> 2:23:38.640]  the old system's just not capable of, of syncing all the data types that are in the new notes app.
[2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:42.480]  Yeah. I don't blame them. I don't, I, in fact, that makes, it makes more, I'd be more worried
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:47.600]  if they let it, if they tried to do it. You know, I really would because the whole IMAP syncing thing
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:53.040]  that notes did was a clever workaround, but it's a terrible terrible hack. Like using IMAP as the
[2:23:53.040 --> 2:24:01.200]  syncing back for notes is, is just a terrible hack. Yeah. No. Yeah. And this, this is a nice
[2:24:01.200 --> 2:24:05.520]  clean modern, not just a nice clean modern notes app, but a nice clean modern architecture for it.
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:12.240]  Yeah. So I'm really looking forward to that, but I wanted to see it. What about Apple news?
[2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:17.360]  Do you use it? I have used it a little bit. Apple news is one of those things where it's not,
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:20.960]  it's only officially supported in the US right now. It's supposed to be in the UK in Australia,
[2:24:20.960 --> 2:24:25.440]  but there was an article saying it's being delayed in the UK. And that, and it's why I had to flip
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:30.000]  my, my iPhone to the US in order to get it. And I'm getting directions in miles, whatever the hell
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:35.040]  those are. But it's, it, it, it, it's, and as people weren't putting content in yet, because it
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.840]  wasn't really switched on, but it's a huge, it's a huge, interesting thing for me because
[2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:44.080]  is it really worth the while of wired and vanity fair and all these articles to make content
[2:24:44.080 --> 2:24:48.560]  specific for Apple news and to sell ads. And yes, you can funnel in your old ads, but you can
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:53.360]  also sell I ads specifically for it. And this goes into the whole content block or discussion,
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:56.800]  but a lot of companies just don't want to have to deal with that complexity. They want one
[2:24:56.800 --> 2:25:01.440]  place to go to sell ads and one place to go to buy ads. And they want one type of content that
[2:25:01.440 --> 2:25:06.640]  they can, you know, spit out a PDF for a ping and put it everywhere. So I just want to see what sort
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:10.480]  of reward Apple gives people, like whether it's going to be huge volumes of eyeballs that
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:14.720]  makes them want to put in the effort to support all of this. I've, I've tried to get into it and
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:18.960]  it just never sticks. And there's nothing I can put my finger on that's wrong with it. And some
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:24.240]  of the times I've, you know, I've found plenty of, you know, articles that I've enjoyed. But I never
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:28.560]  find my, I always, the only reason I ever go to it is because I think I want to get to know this,
[2:25:28.560 --> 2:25:32.960]  you know, this is new. It seems important to me. I mean, it seems important on a couple levels as a
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:37.040]  user, but it also seems important to me is the guy who runs during Fireball. I got to understand this.
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:41.120]  But the only reason I ever launch it, and I've been, like I said, I've been running the iOS since
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:49.440]  July, I only go there when I force myself to go there. It just isn't for me. I don't find it
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:54.080]  compelling. But I don't know. See, it's one of those things that this is a app in particular where I
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:59.360]  really want to get to know it, but it really like what do I do? What does John Gruber do? And some
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:06.960]  sense I'm like a professional news junkie. Like what I do is like my, my career is being an
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:12.640]  obsessive news junkie who reads and reads and reads. And so maybe it's no surprise that this
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:16.800]  isn't for me. This is meant for people who aren't news junkies. So they don't have to be a news
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.760]  junkie to stay up to date. Well, it's a weird experience too, because it does run off of RSS. But
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:26.080]  you know, a lot of, a lot of people don't give full RSS feeds and you start reading a paragraph and
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:29.600]  you have to tap a button and you go into a web view. And I don't even think it's the far
[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:34.560]  review controller. And then you can't, like you can go to, I can go to during Fireball. But if I've
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:38.320]  heard that John did a great article on something, I can't search to find that I have to swipe to
[2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:43.120]  find it. Then if I go to the topic that you wrote about, I can't find that publication. So it's
[2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:48.240]  not really, it's not really suited to someone who's used to net newswire or reader or something
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:54.080]  like that. It really is meant, it is way better in many ways than the news stand app because not
[2:26:54.080 --> 2:26:58.320]  everything is a completely different user experience every time you launch it. But it feels like
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:02.240]  one of those things where it might take in a year from now, we'll see if it's either really,
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:05.120]  really good or it's just not going to go anywhere. Yeah, it's nothing like news
[2:27:05.120 --> 2:27:10.560]  stand because news stand was at the root level, nothing but literally, I mean, it was a great name
[2:27:10.560 --> 2:27:14.400]  for it. News stand was well named. I don't think it was a great idea, but it was well named
[2:27:14.400 --> 2:27:19.360]  because it's just like going to a news stand, you just see a bunch of covers for publications.
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:23.040]  And if anything, you learned less from news stand because at least when you look at a real
[2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:26.400]  news stand, you may be able to read the headlines on the covers. And you have to pick
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.640]  something and you go off and everything remains in its own silo. Like with Apple News, stuff is
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:35.920]  intermingled and you'll get like a thing from the New York Times and a thing from sports illustrated
[2:27:35.920 --> 2:27:42.880]  and whatever. But it just isn't for me. And I didn't really expect it to be, but you know,
[2:27:42.880 --> 2:27:46.480]  I'm just curious to see once it rolls out how many people really take to it.
[2:27:47.120 --> 2:27:50.240]  Yeah, and also it's like they've had they've been doing things with the servers in the back
[2:27:50.240 --> 2:27:53.600]  end for a long time. And ideally it's going to be like Apple music where you go to for you,
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:57.200]  it wants to learn about your preferences and present you with a bunch of interesting stuff.
[2:27:57.200 --> 2:28:01.120]  You may not have found yet, but how well that hits and misses will determine a great deal
[2:28:01.120 --> 2:28:06.720]  of what the value is to you. Yeah. I thought it was so interesting. I love the way that
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:12.640]  you include in your links, in your review your links to all your previous reviews. And you have
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:20.640]  the icons, the icon logos that Apple is used for each OS release. And the ones for 789 are just
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:28.160]  sort of the same except that it's just 789, you know, you know, I wonder I actually didn't even
[2:28:28.160 --> 2:28:32.000]  think to notice because the nines look similar, but I bet they switched the nine to San Francisco
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:36.960]  from Helvetica Noya, but they're all the same. And whereas the ones for two, three, four, five,
[2:28:37.600 --> 2:28:42.720]  six are all like all over the place. Yeah. I'm going to reflect whatever that's key more
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:47.440]  fantasy was at the time. Yeah, I think it really epitomizes what I mentioned to you, you know,
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:52.720]  a while back on this episode that it just shows that the design of iOS 7 has really started
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:59.920]  starting with iOS 7 really matured. Anything else. All right. I guess the only thing I can think
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:04.160]  of that's really, I really want to hit your thinking on because, you know, just item by item,
[2:29:04.160 --> 2:29:08.880]  item by item, I'm just going to send people to your just go read Renee's review. The show's gone
[2:29:08.880 --> 2:29:15.840]  long enough. But what about the deep linking? That to me, so, you know, mutual friend Marco
[2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:19.680]  Armad, he has an app called overcast. And I was just playing around with it. And I had an episode
[2:29:20.400 --> 2:29:24.480]  daring fireball or ATP or something. And I said, remind me of this. And it said, okay, I'll
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:28.080]  remind you of this and put a little overcast icon in. And then I went and listened to a bunch of
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:31.760]  other shows. And then I went back to reminders and tapped on it. And it took me back to the
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:35.840]  episode I wanted to be reminded of. So I ping Marco and I said, did you set this up? And he said,
[2:29:35.840 --> 2:29:39.920]  no, and I started looking into it and it turns out that because he had enabled continuity,
[2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:44.080]  continuity does the activity indexing that that's exactly what they were using. And they were using
[2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:47.920]  that for the back button. And they were using that not in a creepy way. So basically, anytime you
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:52.240]  leave an app, it just drops a bookmark. And then it'll take you right back to there. Anytime you
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:55.840]  leave a reminder, it just drops a bookmark to where you were and takes you right back to there.
[2:29:55.840 --> 2:30:00.800]  And this is a technology that they created for continuity. And there's another continuity technology
[2:30:00.800 --> 2:30:05.200]  that let you move from your website to an app back and forth. And they use that essentially for
[2:30:05.200 --> 2:30:10.480]  universal links. So if I get a Twitter article in messages, I can tap on it. And instead of going to
[2:30:10.480 --> 2:30:14.400]  mobile dot Twitter dot com, like an animal, I go to the Twitter app. And if that Twitter
[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:17.680]  app's not installed, it doesn't care. It's a universal link. It goes back to the mobile Twitter
[2:30:17.680 --> 2:30:22.080]  site. And all of these things just work seamlessly. I think that's what they're calling it seamless
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:26.960]  linking based on existing technology. So, you know, it really like if Marco had to do extra work
[2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:30.400]  to support it, it wouldn't bother me that much. But you know, he's got enough to do already.
[2:30:30.400 --> 2:30:34.960]  And he got all of that for free essentially. And to me, that's one of the really awesome aspects of
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:40.240]  iOS nine is how it took all this stuff and gave us tremendous new features for almost no effort.
[2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:47.120]  Yeah. And I also think it's it's it no additional cognitive load on the user. If you figure it out
[2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:52.800]  and you get the hang of it, you're, you're moving around faster. But if you don't, if you just ignore
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:59.680]  it, you're not, you're not bothered by anything new. There's nothing new to do. I almost worry that
[2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:08.160]  some of the richness of this is just going to go unnoticed because it's so, it's so not in your
[2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:11.920]  face. But like, I would have never even thought that like that's something that's new to me that
[2:31:11.920 --> 2:31:17.520]  you can just go to Siri and what so you're listening to a show and then you jump to Siri and say
[2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:22.720]  remind me of this later. It's not just a show like if you send me a text message or get an email
[2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:28.160]  on you just say remind me of this and it'll put the icon for that app into reminders and deep link
[2:31:28.160 --> 2:31:33.120]  to those part in the app that you were in when you made that that request. Yeah, I can just imagine
[2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:39.920]  right now how many listeners of this podcast are right now in in overcast listening to us say this
[2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:44.080]  and they're trying it right now saying remind me of this later and they're making a reminder
[2:31:44.080 --> 2:31:49.360]  of this of me and you talking about this right now because it's great. And you can say things
[2:31:49.360 --> 2:31:52.720]  like remind me of this like remind me to listen to this when I get in the car and if you plug into a
[2:31:52.720 --> 2:31:57.040]  car kit it knows that you're plugged into a car and it'll it's just very clever. The thing that's
[2:31:57.040 --> 2:32:03.600]  really hit me is because the the back buttons that go in the top left like when you jump to a
[2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:08.720]  web link from something and then Safari has a back to wherever you're from like back to mail.
[2:32:11.520 --> 2:32:16.400]  It's looked clever and I thought this was as soon as I saw it at WWDC I thought that what I'm
[2:32:16.400 --> 2:32:22.800]  about to say was the case but in a summer of using it it is the case where for years one of my
[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:30.800]  you know pet peeves have been the hardware or system level back buttons on Android and Windows
[2:32:30.800 --> 2:32:35.920]  phone and and to me it's the single biggest mistake that Windows phone made because Android was
[2:32:35.920 --> 2:32:39.840]  already out and the designers of Windows phone which I think is a really well-designed system
[2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:49.200]  overall really should have seen the inherent problems of that button. And again like everything
[2:32:49.200 --> 2:32:54.800]  it's trade-offs. There are times when you just want a go back to where I was right before this
[2:32:54.800 --> 2:33:00.080]  even if it's a different app. You've done you've opened a link you're in a browser window now you
[2:33:00.080 --> 2:33:05.600]  want to go back to where you were and that's the counter argument from the Android people that
[2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:11.760]  is the why this you know is supposedly a good design. But among the many problems that I've had
[2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:16.000]  every time I've ever used an Android phone no matter how long how long I've given with it is that
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:20.560]  for every time that it works and takes you back where you want to go there's all another time
[2:33:20.560 --> 2:33:26.560]  where it takes you somewhere where you didn't want to go. Yeah they conflate inter and intra
[2:33:26.560 --> 2:33:34.560]  app navigation exactly a lot of collisions that's exactly an intra an intra app navigation and
[2:33:34.560 --> 2:33:40.320]  it's just and it's never labeled it's just a back button whereas in iOS it's extremely clear
[2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:45.280]  it tells you exactly where you'll be going back and it only it is only up there for when it
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:51.840]  remains contextually useful. So like if you switch from mail to safari it's up there and then if
[2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:56.800]  you just stick around in safari make a new tab since stuff it goes away. Yeah it's great and the
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:01.760]  safari view controller doesn't have a back button and I was you can't just swipe backwards but
[2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:06.640]  then there's collisions about swiping back inside the view controller and through the app so I
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:10.560]  understand why that's like that but you can just see so almost you don't have to do the double click
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:14.080]  anymore and then try to hunt for your app go to the home screen and try to hunt back where you're
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:18.880]  going to you you can just go to an app go right back and the iPhone is a single column it's not
[2:34:18.880 --> 2:34:23.360]  like the iPad where for example you can just tap a bunch of messages in the list view and see the
[2:34:23.360 --> 2:34:28.480]  details change quickly you had to tap go to another message tap go to another message tap messages
[2:34:28.480 --> 2:34:33.680]  go out and they've done all this stuff from the backlink in the deep linking to the 3D touch
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:39.360]  to make navigating a single column interface just almost accelerated. Yeah I think you know
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:44.400]  if there's anything that surprised me and how much it's affected just not affected like it's
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:50.960]  like revolutionized my use of the iPhone or iOS in general because all of it's supplies to the
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:58.720]  iPad as well but it's it's that stuff. Yeah I just I can't live without it and I went back to
[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:03.600]  using an iOS 8.4 device when Apple music was coming out I kept trying to hit it and it wasn't there
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:09.840]  and it really was a blockage on my joint of the device. Anything else you want to say before before
[2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:14.000]  we truly wrap it up I mean I'm out I mean I could talk to you for another three hours about
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:20.160]  iOS 9 but but we've got the multitasking I really like that the multitasking I mean it's limited
[2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:23.920]  on other devices but they did give the slide over so even if you're on an older iPad you can use
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:28.640]  that but just the ability to have multiple apps there and to start you don't necessarily need to
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.080]  all the time but when you do need it if you're watching something and tweets are coming in
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:35.760]  or if you're trying to refer right notes while you're referring to a web page it's another way
[2:35:35.760 --> 2:35:40.240]  where it just enables you to do more without continuously care selling out to a different app and
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:45.600]  that to me is a tremendous time saver. Yeah and I think the thing you have to get used to is
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:48.720]  it comes you it'll come to you if you don't even think about it but what you have to get used to
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:52.960]  is if you see two things on screen at once the one on the left is primary and the one on the right
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:59.760]  secondary even if you're 50-50 even if like on the iPad you've gone to 50-50 if you command tab
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:05.440]  the command tab is switching the primary and the secondary yeah it's still secondary
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:08.880]  and you just remember just remember that primaries on the left secondary is on the right and you
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:16.800]  can switch them if you want and it it all just sort of makes sense as the thing on the left is
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:22.160]  exactly what you're used to in iOS since forever and the thing on the right is a new thing you're
[2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:28.080]  able to do which is you're allowed to have a secondary thing open on the right and it's yeah you
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:33.040]  know if if anybody out there is concerned that this is adding I mean it's obviously is adding
[2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:42.080]  complexity but it's not adding to me confusion and you don't have to I mean it's one of those
[2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:45.600]  things where like note that there's people who just don't know that notification center or
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:49.360]  us control center are there they have a wonderful experience without any of that stuff but if you
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:54.480]  do need more it's almost like depth of design you people who are just nominally interested they
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:58.240]  get the the first layer and they're happy but if you want to put in the effort and dig deeper
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:01.920]  you have greater levels of functionality I think that's a really good way of staging design
[2:37:01.920 --> 2:37:07.200]  yeah it's amazing how much that they've gotten out of side swipes over the years you know
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:10.320]  from and I don't think there was anything I think in the original iPhone there was nothing
[2:37:10.320 --> 2:37:14.640]  that you got from any of the sides because there was no control center no control center no
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:24.000]  no navigate no notification center and now it's you know but it's if you've discovered either of
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:28.880]  those things the the way that you saw it slide in from the side to open up a second app is
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:33.440]  is very natural yeah and they're in the same thing with 3D touch they're using it consistently
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:38.080]  and consistency is a user facing feature because if you can't predict and rely on it you stop trying
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:41.840]  but if it's there when you when you just you don't even think about using it it just becomes natural
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:45.600]  then it becomes part of your workflow yeah it's one of the things I'm really curious about is
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:51.120]  iOS 9 rolls out into the real world is as I you know do my I go into a coffee shop and see what
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:57.120]  devices people are using and you know I'm keen to key and airports is another place where I always
[2:37:57.120 --> 2:38:02.160]  do it yeah keen to see whether this becomes something like when you're going back to your seat
[2:38:02.160 --> 2:38:06.080]  from the restroom on an airplane and you're just looking at what devices people are using how many
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:13.600]  people are using split screen iPad yeah and with keyboards and pencils yeah exactly
[2:38:15.040 --> 2:38:21.120]  Renee Richie thank you for your time people can forget more Renee number one you can go to
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:30.560]  i'm more calm right now and find is comprehensive iOS 9 review on Twitter you are Renee Richie

[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:42.560]  English where we talk to developers about developer stuff we do vector with Georgia and
[2:38:42.560 --> 2:38:47.120]  Guy and Dave Whisk which is more about how to manage effects technology and I do iterate with
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:54.400]  Seth and Mark Edwards about design well there we go talented podcaster prolific slow down a little
[2:38:54.400 --> 2:39:00.640]  bit all right I'm trying I am and I'll talk to you soon thanks for the good work and thanks for your
