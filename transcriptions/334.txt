[00:00.000 --> 00:01.520]  Dieter Bohn, you made a movie.
[00:01.520 --> 00:05.760]  It's kind of a movie. It's a documentary. It's a half an hour. Does half an hour count as a movie?
[00:05.760 --> 00:11.680]  I say so. I mentioned this to Joanna Stern the other week on my show. I love the length of it
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.040]  because it's like you'd left me wanting more, but not like feeling incomplete. And I feel like
[00:21.840 --> 00:28.080]  there's an awful lot. I noticed this during all of COVID, like after my wife and I burned through
[00:28.080 --> 00:33.680]  everything on our list that we actually wanted to see and started watching random stuff. There's
[00:33.680 --> 00:43.040]  an awful lot of documentaries that are, to me, stretched out to be feature length. And it's like,
[00:43.040 --> 00:47.760]  man, that would have been a tight half hour. Yeah. I mean, if you don't know, it's a documentary
[00:47.760 --> 00:51.760]  about this company called Handspring, which you probably spun out from Palm. It's about the trio,
[00:51.760 --> 00:59.440]  et cetera. I really was very aware that when you do these documentaries about like nostalgia,
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.080]  about something from a while ago, the first instinct is to make like, I don't know,
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.320]  like I love the nineties, right? Bring in like a B-list comedian to be like, oh, I had that thing.
[01:08.320 --> 01:13.280]  It was great. It had a keyboard to just like draw it out. And I knew I didn't want to do that. And
[01:13.280 --> 01:21.120]  I also knew that making something that had a larger scope that actually got into Palm and WebOS
[01:21.120 --> 01:27.520]  and all of the messiness that came after would have taken way too long. And so I wanted to tell
[01:27.520 --> 01:34.400]  like a really tight, smallest story that had, but I hope felt like a beginning, a middle, and an end
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.800]  because telling the whole story, it's like Lord of the Rings. It's got like 50 endings.
[01:38.800 --> 01:41.840]  The name of the movie is Springboard. Where does that come from?
[01:43.600 --> 01:50.400]  So Springboard is the name of the slot. So there's a whole long story.
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.760]  The founders of Palm for reasons had to go quit and start their own company. They started
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.200]  Handspring. They had to start making PDAs again. And they're like, well, God, what are we going to
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.840]  do to differentiate? They hustled Palm into licensing the operating system to them. So
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.880]  they're going to make more PDAs and they decide the way to differentiate was to make them cheaper,
[02:08.880 --> 02:14.800]  but also to have them have an expansion module. And they decided to call that expansion module,
[02:14.800 --> 02:20.480]  the springboard slot, the metaphor being that you could jump and expand it to do other things. And
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.200]  so that's where it came from. And the company itself was called Handspring. And I think it
[02:25.200 --> 02:29.520]  was just something you hold in your hand. They ran out of ideas that, and actually Ed Colligan
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.880]  told me that one of the things they dealt with, and this is back in what, 99, when it was founded,
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.960]  maybe 98, is they were looking for a.com, a URL that they could actually get, which back then was
[02:40.960 --> 02:47.120]  already a problem. It's very funny. I had a Handspring. I did not own a Palm device,
[02:47.120 --> 02:53.120]  but the first Palm OS device, first and only one I owned was a Handspring visor.
[02:53.920 --> 03:01.360]  And my wife got one too, and she's not a gadget nerd, but she loved it. We both did. It was,
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.880]  it was a terrific product. It really was. And I know that there were a lot of Palm device
[03:06.880 --> 03:13.840]  aficionados before Handspring, but it really seemed like at least the classic black and white
[03:13.840 --> 03:20.240]  Palm OS reached its peak with the Handspring devices. And one of the weird angles of this
[03:20.240 --> 03:29.280]  is the way that Palm was always sort of the bizarro Apple, where it was like Apple in the 90s
[03:29.280 --> 03:35.600]  got it before Steve Jobs came back and the next reunification tried out of desperation,
[03:35.600 --> 03:41.680]  let's license the OS, right? All this time. And I think long story short, it's Wall Street,
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.640]  when they see a grand success, they want everybody else to do the same thing. And Microsoft famously
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.680]  had a very, they had a very good 90s until they didn't with the DOJ, but financially, even through
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.600]  the antitrust investigation, they were making money faster than they could put it in a bank.
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.760]  And how did they make their money? By licensing software. And so Wall Street,
[04:03.760 --> 04:09.040]  even before Apple got in trouble, was constantly saying, Apple should license their OS. Apple
[04:09.040 --> 04:14.080]  should license their OS because that's where the money is. Not really understanding at all that
[04:14.080 --> 04:18.480]  Apple and Microsoft were fundamentally different companies. And then eventually Apple got into
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.640]  dire straits and they were like, well, we're screwed. All right, we'll just license the OS,
[04:22.640 --> 04:29.360]  which was a bad idea. And Palm similarly never should have licensed the OS to Handspring because
[04:29.360 --> 04:35.280]  all of a sudden the best Palm devices were not made by Palm.
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.960]  Yeah, no, licensing the OS was one of the reasons that there was conflict between Donna, the CEO,
[04:42.960 --> 04:47.920]  Jeff, the product guy, and Ed, and the 3Com who at the time was a parent company when they quit
[04:47.920 --> 04:53.760]  and created their own company. 3Com really thought that the move was to license Palm OS
[04:53.760 --> 04:59.360]  and the people at Handspring, they're like, no, it needs to be software and hardware together.
[04:59.920 --> 05:04.480]  And so don't do that. And 3Com said, no, no, no, we've got this vision.
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.200]  We make modems right now and maybe some networking equipment, but we're going to,
[05:09.200 --> 05:12.240]  everything that connects to the internet, we're going to have a piece of. So we're going to have
[05:12.240 --> 05:16.560]  the handheld computers all the way up to the networking stack. And everyone at Palm was like,
[05:16.560 --> 05:21.600]  well, this is stupid. So they quit. And then they call them back and they're like,
[05:21.600 --> 05:24.960]  you still planning on licensing this thing? And Palm's like, yeah, no, we're going to do it.
[05:24.960 --> 05:28.400]  And like, okay, well, give us one. And there were some other companies that licensed it.
[05:28.400 --> 05:34.480]  Sony made some very, very, very nerdy PDAs called the Clies that were like,
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.640]  they were like the gadgetiest gadgets that ever did gadget. There was a company in Iowa
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.560]  called Handera that licensed it. There were a handful of others, but the only one that
[05:42.560 --> 05:48.560]  actually mattered was Handspring. And by the end, all that licensing stuff, they kept on trying
[05:48.560 --> 05:52.720]  through different versions of corporations and it never worked. And it was always the,
[05:52.720 --> 05:57.360]  it was always one of the things that kept Palm from ever reaching real success.
[05:57.360 --> 06:03.600]  Actually, here's a, here's a wild story. So Handspring fails, gets merged back into Palm
[06:03.600 --> 06:08.960]  and Ed Colligan goes to the board and is like, Hey, this company that you spun out through all
[06:08.960 --> 06:15.440]  these weird things called Palm Source are licensed to license our OS from this company that we spun
[06:15.440 --> 06:21.760]  out is coming up. And I tell you what, if we buy this license for whatever it is, 30, $40 million,
[06:21.760 --> 06:25.120]  whatever the number is, they're going to take that money. And then they're going to turn around and
[06:25.120 --> 06:30.640]  sell themselves because they're in dire straits. And the board who had been the board that had
[06:30.640 --> 06:36.880]  created all these shenanigans in the first place said, no, did not buy them and made them re-up
[06:36.880 --> 06:42.000]  their license again. And as soon as they re-up their license, but Ed said what happened is
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.880]  exactly what happened. Palm Source sold to a company in Japan called Access and that
[06:46.880 --> 06:49.600]  Palm had to like start all over again with a new operating system.
[06:52.720 --> 07:01.120]  The nineties were an era of companies whose boards did not understand the actual companies
[07:01.120 --> 07:05.520]  and what they had in their hands. We could go on and on and list companies like that. That's
[07:05.520 --> 07:14.160]  one of the reasons why Microsoft and Intel were so dominant in that decade. It wasn't just that
[07:14.160 --> 07:18.960]  they had a product that people wanted to buy. It was that they were actually well-run companies
[07:18.960 --> 07:26.480]  run by people who understood what they were actually doing. Apple clearly lost track of
[07:26.480 --> 07:34.000]  what they had and what was good constantly. The whole story of Apple getting into trouble
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.680]  was basically neglecting the Mac, not realizing that the Mac had legs and mistakenly thinking
[07:41.680 --> 07:49.760]  that they were still in like the early eighties when platforms came out, had a few good years,
[07:49.760 --> 07:55.280]  and then you'd come out with a new platform that replaced the old platform and wasn't like
[07:55.920 --> 08:02.160]  it wasn't evolved. And I think Apple fundamentally saw the Mac that way for years and years and years
[08:02.160 --> 08:06.480]  that they were always looking for what's the next thing that's going to replace the Mac.
[08:06.480 --> 08:11.600]  And they had the intelligent pink and all these cooperations with IBM. And meanwhile,
[08:11.600 --> 08:17.920]  the Mac was right there in front of them with industries like print and desktop publishing,
[08:18.480 --> 08:23.680]  building themselves around it. And Apple as a company is looking elsewhere. And Palm,
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.640]  the product, the Palm pilot was sort of like that at 3Com. It's like they had no idea what
[08:28.640 --> 08:33.920]  they had on their hands. It was a terrific product. They just did not understand that at all.
[08:33.920 --> 08:37.360]  Like why in the world would you not want to own the operating system?
[08:38.080 --> 08:42.560]  Yeah, nobody knew what the business models were going to be, right? So I don't know. I mean,
[08:42.560 --> 08:46.320]  benefit of the doubt, Microsoft had so much success. Everyone's like, well, that's,
[08:46.320 --> 08:49.680]  that's how you win. That's how, that's how tech works. And so everyone thought that that's what
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.840]  they needed to do. There was a disconnect from, I think the suits that just didn't use the product
[08:55.840 --> 09:01.360]  or didn't understand what made a good product and how over the longterm making a good product is
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.440]  what wins. And they got caught up in like the risk, the 40 chess strategy of it.
[09:07.440 --> 09:11.280]  I didn't think about, well, no, let's like, let's actually focus on making and selling
[09:11.280 --> 09:14.960]  a good product over and over again. All right, let's take a break. And I'm going to thank our

[10:29.440 --> 10:33.840]  My thanks to Squarespace. I'd like to talk a little, have you seen the general magic movie?
[10:33.840 --> 10:36.720]  Yeah. Oh yeah. No, we, we talked about that a lot. We wanted to make sure we didn't just,
[10:36.720 --> 10:40.480]  just copy it, but we also, you know, wanted to make something a little bit less ambitious. Great,
[10:40.480 --> 10:42.720]  great film. If you haven't watched it, you should definitely go watch it. It's really good.
[10:42.720 --> 10:49.680]  In Springboard, you talking to the protagonists of that time, Donna Dabinski and Jeff Hawkins,
[10:49.680 --> 10:55.520]  who was sort of the product guy behind the whole thing, Ed Colligan. They, I think rightly so. They
[10:55.520 --> 11:01.680]  have the same mindset that the general magic people do in that it's that the work they did
[11:01.680 --> 11:07.120]  laid the foundation for the smartphone era, even though these products didn't start as phones. The
[11:07.120 --> 11:12.400]  people at Palm and the people at general magic see their work as laying the groundwork for what
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.840]  became the smartphone revolution about a decade later. I think that's true, but they weren't
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.960]  making phones, which is so interesting, right? And they didn't even have networking because wifi
[11:22.960 --> 11:31.760]  wasn't a thing yet. And to me, that is the fundamental mistake that all of the PDAs made
[11:31.760 --> 11:39.200]  in the nineties was not foreseeing how essential wireless networking of some sort was to make these
[11:39.200 --> 11:46.240]  things useful to more than the early adopter crowd. Yeah, so the networking thing is fascinating
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.320]  because even if they wanted networking, they couldn't, right? So the wifi either didn't exist,
[11:50.320 --> 11:55.840]  and then you could buy a modem module. Newton, you could hook it up to a modem line or something.
[11:55.840 --> 12:00.480]  The wireless networks, the best you could get was like the Mobitex pager network, which was
[12:00.480 --> 12:06.720]  like not even SMS quality. And so one of the reasons, maybe the key reason, the only reason
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.240]  that the Palm PDA became successful and it wasn't just a generic organizer at Radio Shack
[12:12.240 --> 12:19.200]  was they realized that entering text on this little tiny graffiti area on a 160 by 160 display
[12:19.840 --> 12:22.960]  sucked. And what you wanted was all of your information from your computer.
[12:23.520 --> 12:29.760]  And so they made really, really good syncing software almost by accident. Somebody random,
[12:29.760 --> 12:34.080]  like on the side, coded up a bunch of these hot sync conduits that would work with multiple
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.640]  different pieces of software. And so the fact that you could just set your thing down and hit
[12:38.640 --> 12:43.760]  a button and have your data synced over to it, and then walk away and have your calendar with
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.200]  you and not have to enter 50, you know, 500 contacts on your own, just have it be there
[12:49.840 --> 12:56.560]  was the reason that the original Palm pilots became successful because they, they elevated
[12:56.560 --> 13:02.400]  themselves as an accessory to the PC instead of just being a random digital organizer that you,
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.480]  you know, saw on a shelf somewhere. It was another one of those little tiny
[13:06.480 --> 13:14.080]  thousand paper cuts of being a Mac user in the era that the Mac syncing was always not quite as
[13:14.080 --> 13:19.040]  good as PC syncing. It was there. It wasn't like, yeah, I wouldn't call it an afterthought,
[13:19.040 --> 13:24.000]  but it wasn't, it just did not seem as good. It was like the early days of Napster
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.480]  until the Mac eventually got good Napster clients. But in the early days, it was like,
[13:28.480 --> 13:32.640]  Oh man, everybody else is downloading all this music. And what am I supposed to do? And the
[13:32.640 --> 13:38.080]  Palm pilot syncing was like that. But the other thing that's so interesting about that era was
[13:38.080 --> 13:45.760]  that the PC operating systems, the Mac in particular did not have standard system level
[13:46.400 --> 13:53.440]  databases for things like calendars and contacts. There was no built-in contact in today's world.
[13:53.440 --> 14:00.480]  There's a bunch of great calendar apps for the iPhone and they all hook into the API's
[14:00.480 --> 14:06.640]  Apple provides to use the same calendar data system-wide so that if you actually open Apple's
[14:06.640 --> 14:11.760]  calendar app, the stuff that you've entered using fantastic Cal or whatever other apps are out
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.040]  there, they're all there. There's contact apps that just hook into the central contact database.
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.040]  So if you were to make something that needed to get contacts from your iPhone,
[14:21.040 --> 14:24.560]  you know where to go. There's a bunch of API's you could do it. The Mac, there was nothing like
[14:24.560 --> 14:31.520]  that in that era. Palm had to pick, well, we'll support this app and this app's contacts. And
[14:31.520 --> 14:36.320]  there was like just a short list of apps that you could sync with. But if you did use one of
[14:36.320 --> 14:41.520]  those apps, it was magical to have all of your stuff in a thing that was in your pocket, maybe
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.720]  a stretch, but you could certainly carry the Palm pilot everywhere. Well, famously Jeff Hawkins
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.760]  designed it for the pocket, right? He carried around a block of wood and poked at it with
[14:49.760 --> 14:54.320]  a chopstick as I imagined what it would be like to use. This is a little bit later in the hot
[14:54.320 --> 14:57.920]  sinking era. I can't believe we're talking about hot sink conduits, but here we are. That
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.720]  extensibility of making it work with other apps is one of the things that kept Palm OS
[15:02.720 --> 15:08.960]  feeling vibrant and good because it allowed for third-party apps to create things that could
[15:08.960 --> 15:14.720]  sync over to the Palm pilot as part of that hot sink stack. This eventually worked on the Mac too.
[15:14.720 --> 15:18.800]  There was an app called iSilo that basically worked like a pocket or an
[15:18.800 --> 15:24.800]  Instapaper. There was Avot Go, which would sync over news every day. There was Vindigo,
[15:24.800 --> 15:28.640]  which was like a little mapping software that also synced over like latest restaurant
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.720]  recommendations. There was just a bunch of stuff. There was an installing protocol,
[15:32.720 --> 15:38.320]  so it was easier to install apps that way. There's a bunch of ways that absent a really
[15:38.320 --> 15:45.280]  good usable wireless radio, you could still make it feel like your Palm pilot was somehow connected
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.040]  to the internet. It just connected to the internet in the morning when you hit the hot
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.680]  sync button before you left for the day. Yeah, I think for a lot of people listening,
[15:53.680 --> 15:59.200]  the closest analogy that they might've had in their gadget lives would be the early days of
[15:59.200 --> 16:08.560]  the iPod where your iPod synced via a cable to your Mac or PC and the Palm pilot was like that.
[16:08.560 --> 16:14.720]  You're bringing back memories for me. I had iSolo and I definitely had Avot Go and it was neat.
[16:14.720 --> 16:20.400]  It was really neat to have like news stories that you could read. It was a lot of scrolling
[16:20.400 --> 16:27.600]  because 160 by 160 pixels is not a lot of pixels. And it is funny that it was a square screen on a
[16:27.600 --> 16:35.360]  rectangular device because of the graffiti area with a couple of hard-coded home maps surrounding
[16:35.360 --> 16:42.320]  it. It was a lot of scrolling, but I think that when you're used to using a desktop computer,
[16:42.320 --> 16:47.040]  even today's phones, which are big, it's still a lot of scrolling. It's the nature of a small
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.720]  screen. There's a reason they don't print books that are the size of cell phones. It's not the
[16:52.720 --> 17:00.080]  greatest size for reading, but it's a nice compromise between portability and just the
[17:00.080 --> 17:05.360]  neatness of being. You could just be on the bus if that's how you get to work and you'd have
[17:05.360 --> 17:10.800]  news to read and the thing that you hold in your pocket. It clearly felt like the future.
[17:10.800 --> 17:16.080]  It's impossible to talk about Palm in general and the Palm Pilot without comparing it to the
[17:16.080 --> 17:21.120]  Newton, which did come earlier. It was more capable in terms of its features. It was just
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.080]  slower and bigger and more expensive, right? And more expensive. Yeah. You know, the Newton
[17:26.080 --> 17:30.720]  debuted in 1993. I just looked it up. I think it was like 900 bucks, which in today's money
[17:30.720 --> 17:38.960]  is like 15 or 1600 bucks, which is a lot of money for a gadget. But it was the Newton wasn't as big
[17:38.960 --> 17:46.320]  a failure as popular imagination would hold it to be. Sure. Yeah. And it's widely misunderstood.
[17:46.320 --> 17:53.680]  The handwriting actually got pretty good fast. So the beat up Martha jokes and the Doonesbury jokes
[17:54.320 --> 17:59.760]  didn't have long legs, but that's all people remember. But one thing they never got right
[17:59.760 --> 18:08.000]  was the size. It was a terrible size in hindsight. Nobody has devices that big. We laugh about
[18:08.000 --> 18:13.440]  the biggest cell phones that are available with these giant 6.7 inch phones, but they still fit
[18:13.440 --> 18:19.040]  a pocket, right? The biggest cell phone you can buy still fits in a pocket. The Newton was it just
[18:19.040 --> 18:25.120]  it was neither here nor there. Not big enough to be considered a laptop, even like a netbook
[18:25.120 --> 18:32.160]  sized laptop, but way too big to fit in a pocket and sort of unwieldy to use in one hand.
[18:32.160 --> 18:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, there's an alternate future where, I don't know, the Newton was 20% more popular,
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.880]  and it became the default for what we think computers are like, right? Then we're all
[18:42.880 --> 18:47.920]  carrying around little clipboards instead of phones and iPads and laptops or something. But
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.200]  I don't think that it was likely to get there given the processing power at the time. And
[18:53.200 --> 18:59.600]  actually, so before the Palm Pilot, Palm had this whole thing where they invented graffiti,
[18:59.600 --> 19:03.280]  they'd worked with, I think, I don't know, it was Casio to try and make this thing called the
[19:03.280 --> 19:08.880]  Zoomer, which was huge and like kind of Newton-esque in some ways. And so when they
[19:08.880 --> 19:13.040]  started over and got a little bit of money to start their own company, Jeff Hawkins,
[19:13.040 --> 19:20.080]  one of his first decisions was we are going to use a slower processor on purpose because we're
[19:20.080 --> 19:26.320]  going to keep this thing small. And he picked his design decision was this thing will be this size,
[19:26.320 --> 19:31.600]  and it needs to be very, very fast. It needs to be instant on, and everything else has to flow
[19:31.600 --> 19:35.840]  from those two decisions. And anything that breaks those two decisions is out the window.
[19:35.840 --> 19:42.320]  And that was very much my experience with it. It was super zippy, right? Like it turned on
[19:42.320 --> 19:50.480]  fast instantly and apps launched fast. They were small, they were tight. And for somebody who
[19:50.480 --> 19:57.840]  appreciates good hardware and especially software design, it had that Apple-esque attention to
[19:57.840 --> 20:04.080]  details. And it was a logically thought out system. It was very easy to sort of get a handle
[20:04.080 --> 20:11.200]  on everything you could do. You never needed to dig into anything like a registry or something
[20:11.200 --> 20:17.120]  like that. The metaphor would be similar. It's familiar to anybody who uses an iPhone or an
[20:17.120 --> 20:22.400]  Android phone. You have a home screen and it has apps and you tap on an app and it launches the
[20:22.400 --> 20:32.880]  app. And that's it. But there was a nice though, it was a nice Mac-like consistency between apps.
[20:32.880 --> 20:38.880]  There was a right way to make a Palm app and all Palm apps followed these guidelines, where if you
[20:38.880 --> 20:43.680]  learned how to use one app on the Palm and you used a new app, it would be familiar to you and
[20:43.680 --> 20:49.680]  the menu would be in the same place. The design was the same. So the name for this guidelines was
[20:49.680 --> 20:55.040]  called the Zen of Palm. New people would come to work for Palm and Jeff and Rob Hytani, who was the
[20:55.040 --> 21:00.240]  software designer, came up with the Zen of Palm. They got tired of explaining their software design
[21:00.240 --> 21:04.320]  principles to every new hire. It was like, no, no, no, stop thinking like a PC. And so they wrote
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.760]  this book called the Zen of Palm and it was full of these cones. The most famous one is how do you
[21:09.760 --> 21:13.920]  fit a mountain in a teacup? Oh, you shrink the mountain, you build a teacup, blah, blah. And the
[21:13.920 --> 21:17.440]  answer is you don't. You find the diamond in the middle of the mountain and you put that in the
[21:17.440 --> 21:24.160]  teacup. This had to fit 160 by 160 pixels, black and white too, not grayscale. So one of Rob's
[21:24.160 --> 21:31.280]  design principles, he called it asymmetric design. It was just relentlessly saying what
[21:31.280 --> 21:36.000]  buttons belong on the screen and what stuff can get thrown into a menu and what belongs where.
[21:36.000 --> 21:41.680]  So one of the design examples is say you want to save something. You don't save it,
[21:41.680 --> 21:47.040]  it's just there. You wouldn't give equal weight to say the new button and the delete button because
[21:47.040 --> 21:52.240]  you delete stuff so much less often than you want to make a new thing. And so he buried the new
[21:52.240 --> 21:57.600]  thing under a menu. Another thing that they did was the calendar picker, where you would pick the
[21:57.600 --> 22:05.520]  day. They managed to fit within two taps an entire year of dates on the calendar. And so they
[22:05.520 --> 22:13.040]  launched the dates on 160 by 160 screen. One of the tricks was they realized that the Palm OS
[22:13.040 --> 22:18.400]  system was so fast, it was very easy and non-destructive to cancel something. So they
[22:18.400 --> 22:22.880]  didn't put an okay button. They just made it so you launched the date picker, hit the date,
[22:22.880 --> 22:30.000]  and that's your date. And no one, this stuff seems really obvious and dumb now, but in 1996,
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.400]  these were like actually major innovations and they were ways that nobody had thought about
[22:34.400 --> 22:40.720]  user interface before. The Palm OS for people coming from the PC, which is the vast majority
[22:40.720 --> 22:47.840]  of users in the 90s, there was like a glass of ice water and hell element to what's effectively,
[22:47.840 --> 22:54.960]  it's not Mac style, but Mac caliber UI design, where say what you want about Microsoft,
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.840]  their interfaces were terrible and things like thinking, hey, what if we don't even have an
[23:01.840 --> 23:07.760]  okay button for picking a date? You just pick the date Tuesday, March 7th, and that's it,
[23:07.760 --> 23:12.080]  you're done. And if it was the mistake, you can go back. It's easy to go back and fix it,
[23:12.640 --> 23:22.320]  but it saves that tap. And it sounds stupid that saving one tap to select a date is this
[23:22.320 --> 23:27.120]  great breakthrough, but it adds up when it's pervasive throughout the system.
[23:27.120 --> 23:32.800]  I think about how bad the web is today, you know, the stats of how quickly people will
[23:32.800 --> 23:37.600]  bail on a website. If there's a delay or stuff bounces around, that's not a new principle.
[23:37.600 --> 23:41.840]  People got annoyed with stuff without knowing why since the beginning, when you've got someone
[23:41.840 --> 23:45.840]  who's actually thinking about that and paying attention to it and making a priority, it just,
[23:45.840 --> 23:50.560]  it feels better. Even if you can't express why I do think, and I always thought right from the
[23:50.560 --> 24:00.400]  get-go that Palm and Apple had largely aligned mentalities and priorities, but there were
[24:00.400 --> 24:08.960]  differences. And to me, it's best encapsulated that Palm was comparing to the Apple of the 90s
[24:09.680 --> 24:16.560]  and probably through to today, Palm was more practical or maybe pragmatic is the word.
[24:16.560 --> 24:23.840]  I can't think of a better example of it than the Newton going for true handwriting recognition
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.160]  right from the start, even when they didn't have it working, including then cursive, which
[24:31.280 --> 24:38.000]  was much more of a thing 25 years ago. I don't know many people, especially younger people,
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.960]  my son, I don't, he technically learned it, but it was like two weeks in, I don't know,
[24:42.960 --> 24:49.760]  third grade or something they spend on cursive. And cursive is harder to recognize than printing.
[24:49.760 --> 24:57.120]  Instead of doing handwriting recognition, Palm went with graffiti, which was very similar to
[24:57.120 --> 25:01.840]  printing. So somebody who doesn't know the rules of graffiti and you don't have the cheat sheet
[25:01.840 --> 25:07.520]  handy, if you looked at like a note somebody wrote in graffiti, you'd be able to read it.
[25:07.520 --> 25:15.120]  Cause many of the characters were just printed alphabetic characters. I used to,
[25:15.760 --> 25:21.920]  and I think this was very common amongst owners of Palm devices is that you, you then wind up,
[25:21.920 --> 25:27.200]  you got so used to graffiti that you wound up using it in print with pen and ink. Like you're
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.560]  like, I would be like filling out my rent check and I'd wind up writing it out in graffiti and
[25:32.560 --> 25:37.600]  I'd be like, Oh, what the hell am I doing? I just remembered the T was sort of a, you just go,
[25:38.400 --> 25:43.200]  it's like a seven, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was like a seven. Yeah. I don't want to give Palm too much
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.480]  credit. They like, they picked the slower processor. They had no choice. If they had
[25:46.480 --> 25:51.120]  wanted to do graffiti or handwriting recognition, if they had the processing part to do it,
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.960]  they might've ended up going down that path. They just, it wasn't even an option for them.
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.680]  The philosophy behind it was there's the difference between thinking of intuitive
[25:59.680 --> 26:04.400]  as like an innate thing that you just know as a human and intuitive as a thing that's easy to
[26:04.400 --> 26:11.280]  learn. And Jeff Hawkins was like, look, like if you spent five minutes, 10 minutes learning this
[26:11.280 --> 26:17.600]  thing, it's easy to learn. And then you can leapfrog and actually be relatively fast entering
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.120]  text to this thing and better to ask people to learn how to use a system for five or 10 minutes
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.880]  than to struggle for years to get our end of the handwriting recognition going. Now, how much of
[26:28.880 --> 26:33.840]  this is retconning that they found an explanation for the thing that they had to do? I don't know.
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.120]  I mean, the other thing to remember, and it seems silly to even have to say this, but
[26:37.840 --> 26:43.440]  we're talking about styluses and resistive screens. The refresh rate of these screens,
[26:43.440 --> 26:49.680]  their ability to read input quickly is not very good. An iPhone 12 or 13 or 14 Pro,
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.400]  here we go. An iPhone 14 Pro or modern Android phone reads the screen 240 times a second,
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.320]  right? That's the double to 120 Hertz refresh rate. I have no idea what the refresh rate was
[26:58.320 --> 27:03.760]  on these things, but if it was more than, I don't know, 30, I'd be shocked. Yeah. Like when you
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.600]  scrolled, if you were reading an article or something, when you scrolled, it wasn't really
[27:09.600 --> 27:16.160]  scrolling. It was like paging down and it was show me the next page. And because it couldn't do
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.880]  actual scrolling at a reasonable rate of refresh. Yep. But that was, that was the way computers
[27:22.880 --> 27:28.480]  were. That wasn't even something you thought about. It would have been, it wasn't technically
[27:28.480 --> 27:34.720]  possible to make a device that size that had reasonable live scrolling of text.
[27:34.720 --> 27:40.400]  Yeah. Maybe moving ahead a little bit, like this focus on practicality and let's launch
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.920]  a product based on the technology that we are able to use today that makes a decent experience today
[27:45.920 --> 27:53.120]  is ultimately I think what doomed handspring and the Palm before webOS. And even with webOS a
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.960]  little bit is you look at what Palm and handspring were shipping when the iPhone came out and you
[27:58.960 --> 28:04.000]  look at the iPhone and they were so busy making devices and shipping them because they had to,
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.200]  because they had to sell stuff. They had to get stuff into carriers. They had to make the deals
[28:07.200 --> 28:12.160]  with carriers. They just, they had to make the money off of those things that they didn't have
[28:12.160 --> 28:19.600]  the time or the resources to step back and make a leapfrog in some kind of technology to enable
[28:19.600 --> 28:26.160]  a newer experience. And so in the early days up against both the Newton, but also like Pocket PC
[28:26.160 --> 28:31.280]  and you know, even Symbian, Blackberry, they were head to head, right? They made different
[28:31.280 --> 28:35.920]  technical choices that enabled a better experience within the limitations that everybody was facing,
[28:36.480 --> 28:40.480]  but they never got to the point where they could think about getting rid of those limitations that
[28:40.480 --> 28:46.960]  everyone was facing. And to me, that is fundamentally like the thing the iPhone did is
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.040]  they didn't work within the same constraints everybody else in the smartphone industry had.
[28:51.040 --> 28:53.680]  They stepped back and said, let's get rid of one of these restraints.
[28:53.680 --> 28:58.960]  And in some ways that's where Apple was a decade prior with the Mac, right?
[28:58.960 --> 29:00.080]  Oh, sure. Yeah.
[29:00.080 --> 29:04.880]  When they got desperate and when they finally broke down and bought an X and were thinking
[29:04.880 --> 29:09.440]  about buying B that the Mac was all they had. They might as well have just been the Mac company
[29:09.440 --> 29:15.120]  and they were so far behind because they had neglected it when they should have been building
[29:15.120 --> 29:20.560]  a next generation operating system with modern features.
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.760]  Actually, what's your take looking back with all the benefits of hindsight on, I don't know,
[29:25.760 --> 29:32.400]  Copland, OS 9, all that stuff before OS 10 in between the early systems and what they
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.960]  eventually had to do when they started over with next, there's actually a parallel with Palm.
[29:36.960 --> 29:43.600]  They had, it was Cobalt and they spent a lot of time porting Palm to ARM processors and
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.080]  they went in circles and then Palms were sold and they had a bunch of false starts before
[29:48.080 --> 29:53.600]  they finally hit on webOS. But I'm curious, what do you think it was that kept Apple
[29:53.600 --> 29:59.360]  from making something that was truly modern? How did they get stuck in their own loop on that stuff?
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.760]  I think that they were in, in the early nineties, they were way too,
[30:03.760 --> 30:10.480]  for lack of a better adjective, academic and that they were led by people who just had
[30:10.480 --> 30:17.920]  the sort of mindset that PhD computer scientists at a university have and doing things the right
[30:17.920 --> 30:28.560]  way. And it was not a Steve Jobsian product first mindset. And even the fact that they
[30:28.560 --> 30:36.160]  pre-announced them was just, it just isn't the way to actually build a product. And we know that now
[30:36.160 --> 30:43.040]  Copeland was more focused. Copeland was the next generation of macOS and it was built to run,
[30:43.040 --> 30:49.600]  it was a version of the Macintosh operating system and it was going to run the Mac apps,
[30:49.600 --> 30:56.160]  people knew and loved, and it was a better intention and it was something they should
[30:56.160 --> 31:01.200]  have built. I think long story short, I've never read like a definitive history of what went wrong
[31:01.200 --> 31:06.480]  with it, but I think long story short, shipping is really hard and doing an operating system is
[31:06.480 --> 31:13.440]  really hard and their management just wasn't up to it. And Steve Jobs has said this when they came
[31:13.440 --> 31:20.880]  back, where he thought he'd come back and find that the company was bereft of talent and that
[31:20.880 --> 31:26.160]  that's why they failed and was incredibly pleasantly surprised to find out that the company
[31:26.160 --> 31:32.240]  was full of talented engineers and talented designers and that it really was just a management
[31:32.240 --> 31:37.920]  failure, that the operating system and the whole platform as a whole had stagnated and fallen
[31:37.920 --> 31:44.800]  behind. But the stuff that happened with the sort of the last vestiges of Palm OS was the exact same
[31:44.800 --> 31:48.800]  problem. The management problem was they kept on spinning out companies and selling them and
[31:48.800 --> 31:56.000]  whatever, but before Palm itself embarked on WebOS, Palm Source over on the other end of this
[31:56.000 --> 32:02.000]  other company was developing a bunch of ideas that would have made a modern multitasking operating
[32:02.000 --> 32:07.120]  system. Famously, one of the reasons Palm OS was not good on trios towards the end there was it
[32:07.120 --> 32:12.640]  wasn't a true multitasking OS in the way that other smartphones were. Even the iPhone did a
[32:12.640 --> 32:17.120]  slightly better job multitasking than Palm OS there at the end, but they had built this really
[32:17.120 --> 32:22.160]  good multi-threaded OS that worked on mobile over at Palm Source. They just didn't finish it because
[32:22.160 --> 32:29.520]  they were mismanaged. And so everybody who worked for Palm Source eventually started hearing whispers
[32:29.520 --> 32:35.280]  that there was a new operating system being built over at this little company called Google. And so
[32:35.280 --> 32:42.800]  a bunch of the fundamentals of Android came not just from Danger and the folks from the Sidekick
[32:42.800 --> 32:48.720]  company, Andy Rume's company, it also came from a bunch of people who slowly but surely left Palm
[32:48.720 --> 32:51.920]  Source to go work on something that was actually going to ship over at Google.
[32:51.920 --> 33:03.120]  The trio was the cell phone version of the Palm Pilot. Trios and they all had hardware keyboards,
[33:03.120 --> 33:09.520]  Blackberry-style little keyboard underneath, I believe, right? And yeah, they all had keyboards.
[33:09.520 --> 33:14.880]  Actually, the funny thing about the keyboard, they originally had all the keys in an oval that
[33:14.880 --> 33:22.000]  was tilted, I think, to the right, and Blackberry sued them. And so they got in this big fight,
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.880]  and it turns out what Blackberry had was a design patent of some sort. And so all they did was they
[33:26.880 --> 33:31.120]  flipped the direction of the ovals on the left-hand side of the keyboard to avoid getting sued by
[33:31.120 --> 33:39.040]  Blackberry. I remember in that era, the people who had devices like that—I worked at Barebone
[33:39.040 --> 33:44.960]  Software for two years, the BB Edit company, 2000 to 2002. And that was like the height of
[33:44.960 --> 33:50.480]  Handspring. And I think a majority of the people I worked with, we all had Handspring visors and
[33:50.480 --> 33:57.520]  really liked them. But one of the guys there had a trio, and he just loved it. And it was like an
[33:57.520 --> 34:04.800]  expensive cell plan. I just had a dumb candy bar cell phone, and I got it. And he wasn't proselytizing
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.040]  it, but he just loved it and said, this is the future, having networking on a thing. And I could
[34:11.040 --> 34:16.000]  see the appeal of it. It was just too expensive. And I also recall the late Aaron Swartz, who was
[34:16.000 --> 34:23.120]  a friend of mine, was a big sidekick fan. And I forget what year that would be. That would have
[34:23.120 --> 34:31.120]  been a little bit later, probably like 2003, 2004-ish. And I remember being with him a couple
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.520]  times. One time he spent a couple of days in Philadelphia for some other reason, and we got
[34:35.520 --> 34:40.720]  together a couple times. And he was proselytizing. He was like, you've got to get one of these. And
[34:41.280 --> 34:45.120]  I sat there and went through it with him. And I was like, well, there's so many things wrong with
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.320]  this interface on the sidekick. And he was like, yeah, yeah. And he totally agreed with all of my
[34:50.320 --> 34:55.520]  complaints. And he was like, but you don't understand how worth it it is that when you
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.200]  are out and there's a trivia question or a conversion you need to make, you just type it
[35:01.200 --> 35:08.720]  in and you get the answer wherever you are. It's game-changing. And I didn't disagree with him,
[35:08.720 --> 35:14.320]  but the product was so unappealing to me that I was like, ah, I'll wait.
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.360]  So here's the insane thing. I was in the same boat of trying to proselytize this stuff. I remember I
[35:21.360 --> 35:27.040]  had the handspring visor with this terrible camera on it called the iModule. And I was like, look,
[35:27.040 --> 35:30.400]  you could take a picture and then it'll sink over. And people like, this is stupid. I'm like,
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.520]  no, you don't understand. This is the future. But the insane thing is the people who didn't
[35:35.520 --> 35:41.680]  get it more than anybody were the carriers. They literally told people at handspring,
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.160]  nobody will ever want to take a picture on this. No one will ever want to send a photo.
[35:46.160 --> 35:52.560]  Nobody will ever want to have a text entry that isn't T9. They were the hardest people
[35:52.560 --> 35:58.240]  to convince of all because they were making money hand over fist by just selling high margin candy
[35:58.240 --> 36:06.800]  bar phones. Right. It was like the only text messages anybody sends are things like BRB or
[36:07.360 --> 36:11.600]  be right there. And they're like, so why would anybody want to have a complex text thing? All
[36:11.600 --> 36:15.600]  they do is send three characters at a time, as opposed to thinking the reason everybody
[36:15.600 --> 36:19.360]  was texting like that was because T9 was such an enormous pain in the ass.
[36:19.920 --> 36:22.960]  Yeah. It was like they had it. Although I was pretty good at T9.
[36:23.680 --> 36:29.520]  Oh, I was, I didn't use it enough. I guess I got better. It was a weird skill. I actually,
[36:29.520 --> 36:34.960]  my son is a senior in high school and we were just talking about that. Somehow it came up
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.440]  about the way that push button phones have always had the letters underneath. And he was like,
[36:39.440 --> 36:44.960]  I don't understand that. I don't understand how people give 1-800 get Coke as the Coke
[36:44.960 --> 36:48.160]  as the Coca-Cola hotline. He's like, what does that even mean? It's like, well, you just look
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.840]  for the letter under the number and translate it, but just, just type, even if G and E are the same
[36:53.840 --> 36:59.040]  letter, you just type it twice. And I was like, but when we used to text message, you would press
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.800]  the key as many times. If the T was the third letter on the number, you'd press that one three
[37:04.800 --> 37:12.640]  times to make it a T instead of the first one. And it was so totally unoptimized for the alphabet
[37:12.640 --> 37:19.280]  and the actual frequency with, with which you use numbers. Right. It's so T's the first one. I'm
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.280]  looking at it now. T's the first one on eight, but like the five, the five key is so inefficient.
[37:25.280 --> 37:32.320]  J K and L J and K pretty uncommon letters, L very common letter. You had to type three times.
[37:32.320 --> 37:41.840]  E was two presses. S four presses on a seven for S the most frequent consonant in the English
[37:41.840 --> 37:47.760]  language. You had to press the key four times. Am I misremembering that there were some phones
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.320]  that had like a auto prediction where you, you could just hit the numbers, not have to hit him
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.800]  four times. That did happen, right? I'm not just making that up. Yep. And I, as I recall in my
[37:56.800 --> 38:06.240]  mind, that became a thing right around 2007, it was too late. No, but that definitely became a
[38:06.240 --> 38:11.680]  thing where they would do like dictionary lookups and you could just press, press it once, but we'll
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.080]  be doomed to complain about autocorrect for the rest of our lives. Man, you've been tweeting about
[38:16.080 --> 38:22.240]  autocorrect being bad on the iPhone. You have to go through these workarounds. It is, it's pretty
[38:22.240 --> 38:29.280]  bad. And I don't understand what, what they're pulling from and that they can just drop to 2.0.
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.960]  I bounce a lot between different phones and between iOS and Android. So I just assume that
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.400]  I always have bad autocorrect and like my muscle memory for different keyboard sizes is always
[38:40.400 --> 38:45.040]  wrong. This is why I make so many typos on Twitter, or at least I tell myself that's why,
[38:45.840 --> 38:52.800]  but man, it is bonkers how it feels like we've regressed. And I can't tell if it's
[38:52.800 --> 38:58.080]  because we expect more and it doesn't, it's not hitting that or if it's an actual regression.
[38:58.080 --> 39:04.800]  I think it's an actual regression to some degree and Ken Kishenda, who's no longer at Apple,
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.960]  but he was the engineer. He wrote the book, creative selection, I believe is the title
[39:08.960 --> 39:14.080]  of his excellent book. He's at that mysterious startup now. What's it called? Started by two
[39:14.080 --> 39:18.800]  other X Apple people. Oh shoot. I know the one you're talking about. It's got like a
[39:19.600 --> 39:25.840]  very generic, not generic name, but like an abstract name. I'm losing it. Hold on. I know
[39:25.840 --> 39:31.760]  it's on his Twitter bio. It is humane. Humane. Yes. Thank you. I don't know what they're,
[39:31.760 --> 39:35.600]  I honestly don't know what they're doing. I'm friends with Ken, but I like any good former
[39:35.600 --> 39:40.960]  Apple person. His lips are utterly sealed. I'm not even sure his spouse knows what he's working on,
[39:40.960 --> 39:48.400]  but anyway, he, he was the, he wrote the original keyboard and autocorrect for the original iPhone.
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.520]  It was just, that was one person, Ken, because the team was small. That's how you keep things secret.
[39:53.520 --> 39:58.720]  And he has unsurprisingly strong opinions about this, but I think the fundamental error Apple
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.760]  has made on this and it's a, this is a very big tangent, but I think it is the way that
[40:06.560 --> 40:16.960]  modern Apple really wants to hide how things work. And there is to me that the antithesis of
[40:16.960 --> 40:23.440]  the classic Mac OS where in the classic Mac OS, you could all, why did whatever just happened
[40:23.440 --> 40:31.040]  happened? You could always figure out exactly why. So there was autocorrect like on classic Mac OS in
[40:31.040 --> 40:39.680]  1990, but if there had been, or you would have been able to know exactly what and why on Mac OS
[40:39.680 --> 40:46.480]  10. And it's a thing they inherited from next. It literally might date to like 1989 and it might be
[40:46.480 --> 40:54.480]  in the exact same location, but like you're typing in a regular Mac app and you type a word that
[40:55.120 --> 40:59.520]  isn't in the dictionary and it gets the red underlines, but you know, it's an actual word.
[40:59.520 --> 41:04.480]  Maybe it's like a product name or something like that. And you control click on it and,
[41:04.480 --> 41:11.120]  or right click on it and you can say, add to dictionary. And now, now any way in other apps,
[41:11.120 --> 41:16.880]  other documents, that word will always be treated as spelled correctly. That, but what happens if
[41:16.880 --> 41:21.040]  you make a mistake or you want to take one out? Well, there's actually, it's just a simple text
[41:21.040 --> 41:26.240]  file. I forget the actual name. I can put a link in the show notes, but in your home folder,
[41:26.240 --> 41:34.320]  in the library, in some folder within the library, there is just a text file and you could open it up
[41:34.320 --> 41:41.200]  in any text editor and it is just one word per line. It's not, it's not an P list XML file. It's
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.120]  not JSON or anything like that. Just a text file, a list of words. And there they all are. And you
[41:47.120 --> 41:52.720]  could see them and you can know that therefore you can know where these extra words that aren't
[41:52.720 --> 41:58.000]  in the dictionary come from and where to go to add them. There's nothing like that on iOS, right?
[41:58.000 --> 42:09.760]  It's, there's no way to know why when I was typing 20 to zero, I kept getting 2.0 as the autocorrect.
[42:10.320 --> 42:17.920]  And that one was hitting me for months. And it's, I type, I try to type the digits 20
[42:19.120 --> 42:25.040]  frequently enough that it was something that I complained about in public on Daring Fireball,
[42:25.040 --> 42:31.280]  but infrequently enough that I never, ever remembered that this is not going to work.
[42:31.280 --> 42:36.560]  I need to go to the correction bar right above the keyboard and manually select
[42:38.080 --> 42:43.920]  quote 20 instead of taking the default 2.0, which several people pointed out you can just do that.
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.000]  And I was like, yeah, but I don't remember. I don't expect when I type
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.440]  20 on the keyboard for that to be autocorrected. And it turns out
[42:51.440 --> 42:55.440]  Well, and also it should, it should remember that you've done that a couple of times and just
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.920]  changed like that, not to put too fine a point on it, but that is, that is what Gboard does.
[42:59.920 --> 43:04.160]  Right. Well, and supposedly some people said that if you type it like eight times,
[43:04.160 --> 43:09.520]  eight or nine times and choose it each time, it'll remember then. But again, there's no way,
[43:09.520 --> 43:16.240]  there's no way of knowing how many times you need to do it before it'll stick. And the explanation,
[43:16.240 --> 43:19.760]  I got the correct explanation. I'm a hundred percent sure this is where the,
[43:19.760 --> 43:25.360]  at least this one was coming from. It wasn't some machine learning thing. It was the fact that I
[43:25.360 --> 43:32.720]  have an app installed with 2.0 in the app's name. It's our right. And, and it's an app I don't want
[43:32.720 --> 43:37.840]  to get rid of. I don't know why it's a stupid thing to put in the app's name anyway, but
[43:38.480 --> 43:45.600]  that's where it came from. And the solution I chose, which works is to go to settings,
[43:45.600 --> 43:52.240]  general keyboard, text replacements, and just make a do nothing text replacement. We're typing
[43:52.240 --> 44:01.920]  the digits 2.0 has the shortcut 2.0. So it's just type 2.0 to get 2.0. But once you add that
[44:01.920 --> 44:08.320]  as a texture, I prefer that even though it seems it is annoying to me as a perfectionist that I
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.040]  have to make a do nothing text replacement for this. And this works for swear words too. If
[44:13.040 --> 44:19.600]  you're cursed with the ducking instead of the F word version, you can just add that word in there
[44:19.600 --> 44:26.080]  as a do nothing text replacement. And it should, you know, stop giving you ducking where you want
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.200]  to curse. But there's no explanation. There's no document that says here's where autocorrect gets
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.280]  sources. And a lot of people, I don't know if it's true or not. You don't know, but Apple doesn't
[44:35.280 --> 44:41.280]  explain it. Lots and lots of people emailing me about this since I wrote about it have said that
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.720]  they're convinced that in addition to like surprising sources like the names of your apps
[44:46.720 --> 44:54.160]  installed. One fellow has a game, one of my readers has a game where the name has the word
[44:54.160 --> 45:02.240]  Amy in it, A-M-Y, but they spell it in all caps. Mario Run does the same thing. So Mario Run is,
[45:02.240 --> 45:08.720]  Nintendo spells it in all capital letters. So if you type Mario, it autocorrects to the all caps
[45:08.720 --> 45:13.520]  version. Well, this guy's wife's name is Amy. And guess what? He types his wife's name a lot. And
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.880]  every time he thanked me for the autocorrect suggestion, he obviously has a contact card for
[45:18.880 --> 45:24.400]  her too, but it was defaulting to this game he has where Amy is spelled in all caps. So every time he
[45:24.400 --> 45:28.480]  typed his wife's name, it turned into all caps. I have a great startup idea. We're going to make
[45:28.480 --> 45:32.880]  an app for every single person's name. We're going to find out something that'll get it through App
[45:32.880 --> 45:39.840]  Store reviews so that it'll actually be accepted. And then you can pay 99 cents to get an app that
[45:39.840 --> 45:42.800]  will keep autocorrect from screwing up your closest contact's names.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.640]  It is. It's a funny thing that we have to complain about, but there we are. All right,
[45:48.640 --> 45:52.480]  let me take a break here. Thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends at HelloFresh.

[47:30.560 --> 47:35.120]  started with a black and white operating system, literally not grayscale, just black and white
[47:35.120 --> 47:40.400]  pixels. And then eventually went to color and it was sort of a painful transition.
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.760]  Yeah. With Palm, it was the transition to grayscale. I admit it was a transition to
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.960]  color, which came honestly kind of late, but it was also the transition to different screen
[47:50.960 --> 47:56.160]  dimensions. They went from 160 by 160 to 320, which was just pixel doubling. So that was great.
[47:56.160 --> 48:02.800]  They finally released some random PDAs that I think had 360 by 480 screens, but they were just
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.760]  stuck on that screen resolution and apps that were hard coded to that screen resolution
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.880]  up until they just, they killed off their Palm OS devices. They just, they could never get out of
[48:12.880 --> 48:18.240]  it. Yeah. The Mac had similar problems in the eighties when they started growing beyond the
[48:18.240 --> 48:26.560]  classic slash original Mac all-in-one form factor that was 512 by 384. You'd find some shareware
[48:26.560 --> 48:34.960]  app and then you'd launch it on a bigger display and it would just show up as 512 by 384 area on
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.320]  the screen. It was like, huh, I guess this is an older app. Those things are tough, you know,
[48:40.320 --> 48:48.640]  and I think part of what made the iPhone a success and has kept it relevant and thriving, I think is
[48:48.640 --> 48:54.960]  true for Android too, is that by building on the foundations of actual Unix or in the case of
[48:54.960 --> 49:04.400]  Android Linux, it, it, it had room to grow in multitasking, even if the way they implement,
[49:04.400 --> 49:10.480]  it was like the lack of quote unquote multitasking in the first few versions of the iPhone's
[49:10.480 --> 49:15.920]  operating system. Wasn't because the OS didn't support it. It was because the user interface
[49:15.920 --> 49:21.360]  didn't support it because they didn't, didn't have enough RAM, didn't have, didn't have enough CPU,
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.200]  didn't have enough battery life to have anything running in the background. It wasn't that they
[49:25.200 --> 49:31.280]  technically couldn't. It was that as a product decision, they encapsulated it into an interface
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.440]  that once you hit the home button, whatever you were using was suspended. That was it.
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.160]  Yeah. It's an interesting academic question. What are the decisions and preconceptions at
[49:42.160 --> 49:48.000]  the foundation of the operating system that are difficult to change or immutable? And I feel like,
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.160]  I don't know, right now, there's, there's way fewer of those, at least on modern operating
[49:54.160 --> 50:00.720]  systems. There's more freedom to change stuff around and add features and move UI around
[50:00.720 --> 50:06.080]  in ways that the real limitation is just a philosophy more than it is. Can the thing
[50:06.080 --> 50:11.360]  actually do it there? The other similarity that I see and, and these movies, your movie
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.720]  springboard and the general magic movie and just the overall nostalgia. And Hey, we are where we
[50:16.720 --> 50:23.520]  are in the mobile world of the duopoly of iOS and Android. It no longer feels like news. This is,
[50:23.520 --> 50:29.120]  it's just cemented. It's the world we live in. Yeah. But looking back on it, there, there is
[50:29.120 --> 50:35.520]  just an incredible similarity in PDAs to phones, whatever you want to call all these handhelds to
[50:35.520 --> 50:41.840]  the early PC era of the late seventies and early eighties, where there were dozens of different
[50:41.840 --> 50:46.720]  platforms and dozens of companies and everybody just did their own thing. And there was Commodore
[50:46.720 --> 50:54.080]  and Atari had computers. And of course there was Apple and the, then came the PC and DOS.
[50:54.080 --> 51:01.680]  You could just Altair, the list goes on and on. And then there were two, it was the Mac and
[51:01.680 --> 51:06.880]  windows. And it's the same with the PDAs and the early phones, right? Like you mentioned Symbian,
[51:06.880 --> 51:14.320]  there was Blackberry, there were Newton and Palm, and of course Pocket PC from Microsoft. And there
[51:14.320 --> 51:20.560]  were lots and lots and lots of platforms and lots of enthusiasm from early adopters. And
[51:20.560 --> 51:26.240]  then there were two. Yeah. Well, and I mean, do I think that it's inevitable that platform markets
[51:26.240 --> 51:31.280]  boil down to duopolies? I'd like to say no, it was a lot more fun back in the day when I was
[51:31.280 --> 51:37.760]  running Trio Central, Windows Central, Nokia Central, Android Central, and iMore, all at
[51:37.760 --> 51:42.000]  the same time. There were, we had, we had, and there were communities around every single one
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.800]  of these smartphone platforms, and it wasn't really clear who was going to win out and what
[51:46.800 --> 51:51.120]  was going to stick around. And there was lots of money being invested and devices out there.
[51:51.120 --> 51:56.240]  And now the best hope for diversity is a bunch of companies running stuff that is sort of like
[51:56.240 --> 52:01.680]  Android-esque, right? That will run Android apps, but maybe isn't technically just a straight Google
[52:01.680 --> 52:04.880]  version of Android. We're starting to see that on, I don't know, Chromebooks and Windows is going to
[52:04.880 --> 52:09.840]  run Android apps now. But yeah, it's, I don't know. I, part of me is just, I liked the idea
[52:09.840 --> 52:14.640]  of more competition. I liked the idea of more diversity, but I also liked the idea of having
[52:14.640 --> 52:19.120]  a big stable ecosystem from a company that can be held accountable for, you know, making sure stuff
[52:19.120 --> 52:25.440]  doesn't fall apart, right? So I don't know. And looking at Palm in particular, they just,
[52:27.040 --> 52:31.120]  they're one of those companies where, especially with Handspring, that little interregnum period
[52:31.120 --> 52:37.040]  of Palm, they just, they had so much stacked against them that it's a miracle they shipped
[52:37.040 --> 52:43.600]  products at all. This like, my joke that I always tell is if at six points in their history, if
[52:43.600 --> 52:49.120]  just one executive had made a different decision, or if one venture capitalist had given them an
[52:49.120 --> 52:52.960]  extra $300 million, things would have been different. They got bought by US Robotics.
[52:52.960 --> 52:57.520]  They got bought by 3Com. They spun out. They got spun back in. They spun out in two different
[52:57.520 --> 53:01.840]  companies. They, they sold off another company. They had three false starts on different operating
[53:01.840 --> 53:08.960]  systems. They tried to sell into Verizon. Verizon said no. They got stuck with Sprint.
[53:08.960 --> 53:14.480]  They did it again. Verizon played them and launched the Droid instead of the Palm Pre just
[53:14.480 --> 53:20.080]  over and over and over again. They got, they got stuck by just external sort of economic and
[53:20.080 --> 53:26.800]  corporate factors that prevented their decent products from having a chance to improve and
[53:26.800 --> 53:32.000]  evolve. And is it inevitable that the same sort of thing would have happened to other platforms?
[53:33.120 --> 53:38.240]  I don't know. I look at Microsoft in particular. They're the ones where I just don't get it.
[53:38.240 --> 53:45.040]  I don't get why they weren't able to just stick with it and make something good other than
[53:45.040 --> 53:50.320]  they didn't realize what a mobile device should be until it was way, way, way, way, way too late.
[53:50.320 --> 53:54.400]  And the market had already been ossified into iOS and Android.
[53:54.960 --> 53:59.440]  I think that, again, doing the alternate universes, I think there's an alternate universe
[53:59.440 --> 54:07.040]  where Satya Nadella had taken over earlier from Ballmer. And I'm not saying Ballmer obviously
[54:07.040 --> 54:13.840]  made the company tons of money. And there are some good analogies between him and Tim Cook
[54:13.840 --> 54:18.960]  in terms of how the company grew under his leadership after Bill Gates stepped aside.
[54:19.600 --> 54:24.480]  You mentioned the Palm Pre. Now that's, this is beyond the scope of Springboard,
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.240]  you're the documentary, which is very specifically. The reason you get away
[54:28.240 --> 54:32.720]  with doing it in 32 minutes is that you're very specifically tightly focused on handspring.
[54:32.720 --> 54:42.480]  The Palm Pre was Palm's answer to the iPhone. And so there's, well, we should also mention,
[54:43.120 --> 54:46.560]  I don't think I've linked to it yet from Daring Fireball. I wanted to have you on
[54:46.560 --> 54:53.040]  and before I did, but you dug up, I've made great hay over the years of the Ed Colligan
[54:53.040 --> 55:00.800]  quote from the New York Times in December of 2006 at some sort of public function.
[55:00.800 --> 55:07.600]  He was interviewed by John Markoff on stage and yep. And December 2006 is a month before
[55:08.480 --> 55:16.400]  the iPhone was introduced on stage at Mac World Expo. And the nobody knew what it was going to
[55:16.400 --> 55:22.080]  look like. Most people, including me, were betting it would be some sort of iPod phone.
[55:22.080 --> 55:30.720]  But the rumblings that Apple was doing a phone were as strong as without knowing any details of
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.440]  what the hell it actually was, were so strong. Because there's just, it was too many chances
[55:35.440 --> 55:42.880]  to leak. I don't know if it leaked from AT&T or at the time, Singular. Who knows, but just basically
[55:42.880 --> 55:49.280]  Apple is doing a phone was out there in the air. And the way that the quote was originally printed
[55:49.280 --> 55:54.480]  made it seem like Ed Colligan was talking very specifically about Apple. And the way he was
[55:54.480 --> 55:59.760]  quoted was the PC guys aren't, we've been doing this for a long time. PC guys aren't just going
[55:59.760 --> 56:05.520]  to come in. Right. And it turns out you've done the work. That's not what he said.
[56:06.960 --> 56:11.200]  Well, yeah, not quite. So the thing, the way he was quoted was PC guys are not just going
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.040]  to figure this out. They're not just going to walk in. But it was actually, they were talking
[56:15.040 --> 56:19.120]  both Ed and John and everybody was like, well, it'll be an iPod and maybe it'll just use Wi-Fi
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.360]  and not connect to the carriers because Apple hates the carriers. He called them orifices.
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.720]  But what about the Moto Q, which was a Windows mobile device that was not great. And he also,
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.560]  there were rumblings that Google was going to be making something. At the time, Eric Schmidt,
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.240]  who was a CEO of Google, was saying things like, oh, phones should be free. We're going to give
[56:36.240 --> 56:42.560]  phones away and we'll make money on the backend. Never quite got there. So that's the context of
[56:42.560 --> 56:47.200]  the question. And then Colligan's quote is, I would just caution people that think they're
[56:47.200 --> 56:51.840]  going to walk in here and just do these. We struggled for a few years. The PC guys are not
[56:51.840 --> 56:56.560]  going to just knock this out. And then he's like, welcome, guarantee it. Welcome. Let's go for it.
[56:56.560 --> 57:00.960]  Come on in. And he also says a little bit later on, I'm not trying to be cocky about this. It's
[57:00.960 --> 57:05.040]  a tough business. But I asked Ed about this later during the interview. He didn't make it into the
[57:05.040 --> 57:10.000]  documentary. He was very quick to point out, look, I got my start at Apple. Donna got her
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.200]  start at Apple. Two or three of my companies that I've started were basically Apple software
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.080]  accessory companies. I love Apple. I use Apple stuff. I was trying to talk about the market in
[57:20.080 --> 57:26.240]  general and PC guys in general, not specifically about Apple, which is, Apple's in the thing he's
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.800]  reacting to here. So it's not so much if he was saying, well, they definitely aren't going to walk
[57:30.800 --> 57:35.840]  in and figure this out. I'm predicting failure here. It was indictment on Google specifically,
[57:35.840 --> 57:42.400]  but also Motorola and a bunch of other companies that like, it's not as easy to make a phone as
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.240]  people seem to think it is. And that's true. A bunch of companies thought it would be really easy
[57:48.240 --> 57:53.200]  to just roll into the mobile market and make a phone and they turned out to be wrong. But I also
[57:53.200 --> 57:57.840]  think that it's not just that making a phone was so hard that that's the only reason Palm didn't
[57:57.840 --> 58:04.160]  do well, right? Palm shot itself in the foot in a million ways. The thing about Ed Colligan is
[58:05.920 --> 58:15.680]  he is by far the nicest sort of kindest CEO I've ever interacted with, perhaps to a fault. And
[58:15.680 --> 58:19.680]  that's one of the reasons that if Palm had been maybe been a little bit more ruthless and cut
[58:19.680 --> 58:26.000]  throat, they might've had a different history. The idea that he would like cynically be taking a pot
[58:26.000 --> 58:33.120]  shot at Apple is pretty unlikely, not the least of which because around this time he had specifically
[58:33.120 --> 58:39.440]  called Steve Jobs and said, Hey, Steve, how's it going? We've got this new trio here. And we also
[58:39.440 --> 58:43.360]  were thinking about making this folio, which was a failed proto netbook product that they were
[58:43.360 --> 58:48.320]  considering. And Steve Jobs said, Oh, yeah, it seems nice. I don't really use smartphones myself.
[58:48.320 --> 58:56.080]  Thanks. No, thanks. One of at least two, maybe three or four times that Palm and Apple got in
[58:56.080 --> 59:00.240]  the same room together and there was the vibe that maybe the acquisition could happen. Steve called
[59:00.240 --> 59:04.080]  Donna Dubinsky back when they were Palm way beforehand and offered, said that they should
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.000]  go over and let Apple buy him. And Donna said she didn't want to work for anybody anymore.
[59:08.000 --> 59:15.600]  So anyway, long story short, it was a bit of a misquote. Directionally, he maybe was being
[59:15.600 --> 59:22.160]  a little bit too, he was overstating how, how, how difficult it might be for some companies,
[59:22.160 --> 59:25.760]  but he definitely got it right that a bunch of companies thought it would be easy and it
[59:25.760 --> 59:33.120]  super wasn't. I think that the key thing that he didn't foresee had nothing to do with the hardware
[59:33.120 --> 59:40.480]  or software. I even know the iPhone was surprisingly advanced and famously the Blackberry
[59:40.480 --> 59:45.600]  executives thought Apple was lying about its capabilities so that it couldn't possibly,
[59:45.600 --> 59:49.200]  there's no way they could pack what they're saying. They're packed into a thing like that.
[59:49.200 --> 59:54.400]  And so I do think it was surprising. It was ahead of its time. It was years ahead of the competition
[59:54.400 --> 01:00:00.800]  at a, at a product level. But I think the key thing that Ed Colligan and nobody else really
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:11.680]  foresaw was Apple. And I will, I tend to be loathe to say only Steve Jobs could blank, but I feel
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:20.560]  like in the case of the deal they got from Singular slash AT&T and the control they got over
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.240]  the product was something that somebody like Ed Colligan, who had negotiated with all these carriers
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:34.400]  around the world and knew why Steve Jobs called them orifices and knew what those, the carriers
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.800]  did to these products from it. And Palm of all companies knew this because they were a
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:47.600]  product centric company, right? They knew what things became worse on a trio once it went through
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:54.480]  the filter of Verizon or whoever else. And the fact that Apple was able to get Singular to just
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:00.080]  say, you do, you, you do your thing, Apple, you make it your way, you handle the software updates,
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.080]  it's all sure you can do it all. Famously, they didn't even see the iPhone. They didn't show it
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:13.840]  to them. They obviously knew about like the antenna details and stuff like that, like the
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:20.240]  things that made the iPhone a phone. And they worked with AT&T to get the visual voicemail
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:25.840]  as a feature on day one, which again, in hindsight is bananas that we, you used to actually have to
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:32.880]  deal with all of your voicemail on a phone call. You'd have the only way before the iPhone to get
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:39.360]  your voicemail was to call me. I forget what you hit. It was a pound, I don't know, pound 70 or
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.560]  something like that would make a phone call to your carrier. And you would say you have three
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.000]  new voice messages and you'd have to deal with them all on the keypad. So they obviously
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.560]  knew some details. It wasn't like it was a complete black box, but famously Singular didn't
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.800]  actually get to see the iPhone and know that it had a touch screen and what it looked like and
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.120]  stuff like that. I don't think anybody foresaw that. And it was obviously key to the iPhone's
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:11.280]  success. I think that even given the quality of the hardware and the software that Apple was able
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:18.880]  to do, if the iPhone had gone, had to go through the typical carrier filter of, well, let us add
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.080]  our Verizon app and stuff like that and all the firmware updates or whatever you want to call
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.440]  software updates, we have to handle that. There's no way we can let you handle that. In other words,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.880]  the customer's relationship would be like with all previous phones entirely through the carrier.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.040]  And Apple just happened to be the company that made the phone, but you have no relationship
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:44.160]  with Apple. Your relationship would be entirely through your carrier. The fact that Apple was
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.480]  able to negotiate their way out of that with just starting with one carrier, but one major carrier,
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.840]  to me, was the key thing that I don't think Ed Colligan foresaw. And I think he would have...
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.480]  I think his quote, even correctly in context, as you now have the transcript, would date much
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.320]  better if Apple had to. It was like if Apple hadn't found a partner in Singular willing to do
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:17.280]  this, it would have played out much more like Ed Colligan foresaw. Yeah, there would have been way
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:25.600]  more compromises in the product. I mean, Palm was unable. They got the core on one carrier in Europe
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.880]  in orange. They made them get rid of the home screen and replace it with an orange home screen.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:38.560]  In the US, several carriers refused to let them ship an email app on the phone itself. They had to
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.880]  backdoor it to customers, sync it over after they installed it in the manual in the box,
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.480]  because the carriers would only allow them to ship it with the carrier's email app linked to your
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:56.320]  at sprit.net whatever email address was on the phone itself. Just utterly ridiculous requirements
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:03.200]  that... Palm just didn't have the leverage to say no. I could be misremembering this, because this
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.960]  is why I didn't have a smartphone at the time. But I remember, I seem to recall that at least
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:12.000]  one of the US carriers, they gave you an email address. You could only use their email address
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.320]  on their quote-unquote smartphones, but your email address was your phone number at carriername.com
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.000]  or something like that. You didn't even get your name. It was just your phone number
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.280]  as your email address. I mean, I asked everybody that I interviewed for this thing,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.320]  why do you think the iPhone beat you? I gotta ask. And Jeff Hawkins was one of the first...
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.600]  Everyone said it was a great product, although everyone said that the very first iteration wasn't
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.640]  that good. But Jeff Hawkins recognized that they nailed the form factor. And Peter Skillman,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:46.960]  who was industrial designer for Handspring, also pointed out the ability to step back and go make
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:55.920]  that capacitive touchscreen. So the ability for Apple to have a fresh slate and make a product
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.880]  that didn't have any sort of historical baggage attached to it, combined with the ability to
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:09.120]  convince a carrier to let them just make the thing they wanna make is why the iPhone became
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:15.280]  the iPhone, why it just blew everybody's mind. And if you're worried about next quarter's results,
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.560]  and you're worried about making payroll, you're just never gonna be able to do that.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.520]  JS Yeah. I'd like to thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:29.520]  Ernest, E-A-R-N-E-S-T. Look, it's 2022. Federal student loan payments are on hold, but with
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:36.240]  interest rates this low, now is a good time to refinance your federal student loans.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:43.440]  Ernest was voted best student loan refinancing overall by NerdWallet, who knows their stuff.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:50.480]  Ernest has some of the lowest rates, flexible payments, and an in-house team ready to help you.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:55.200]  With Ernest, you could change your interest rate, get a lower monthly payment,
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.480]  and you'd never pay fees, not even late fees. And by refinancing, you can reduce your loan terms,

[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:35.600]  been on my show, we've danced around. Let's dig in. Okay. When better than now for me and you
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:44.640]  to have it out with Palm Pre? I will say this. I think the Palm Pre is arguably the nicest product
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:53.120]  I've ever used that didn't make it. Or it's up there on the list. Yeah. Here's the thing about
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.120]  me and the Palm Pre. Obviously, everybody knows them. I ran Pre Central, closely associated with
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:02.640]  the brand, married somebody who worked at Palm. I got to say the nicest is hard for me to agree
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:08.480]  with. It had the most potential and it was like the best designed in terms of software. And it
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:14.800]  was like the most clearly intentional. It would have a complete thought to it. But man, that
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:21.280]  hardware was terrible. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I guess that what you said is better matches my
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:27.440]  feelings. It needed to improve. I'm not saying that as it actually shipped, it was the best
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:34.560]  product that didn't make it. But what it needed, when it just needs to get faster, that's a thing
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:42.800]  you can do. What was wrong with the Newton is a complex question because it wasn't just it needed
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:51.360]  to be faster. It needed lots and lots of things. What do I think is wrong with Windows user
[01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:57.760]  interface? Well, that's one of those computer books we used to buy back in the 90s, where
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.120]  they're as thick as a phone book. Because famously, I forget, I think it was Tim O'Reilly
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:08.480]  who said, yeah, why are these computer books so thick? Because look at the sales data. People go
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:15.200]  into a bookstore and they're looking for a book on blank, whatever it is, and they just pick the
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:21.760]  thickest one and go to the register. Yeah, amazing. That's my list of what's wrong with
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.360]  Windows. What was wrong with the Palm Pre was it was too slow. Yeah. Well, and the hardware was a
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:34.080]  little junky. They couldn't afford to make something truly nice. The thing about the Web OS
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.360]  and the Pre is if you remember what phones were like when it first launched, they were a little
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:46.800]  late, but Android was pretty junky at the time. It was not anywhere near as polished as it is now.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:52.800]  There were things that the iPhone was incapable of doing at the time that the Palm Pre could do.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.960]  I don't remember where in the timeline Windows Mobile versus Windows Phone lands here, but both
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:04.720]  of those were not in a super polished place. We look at our phones now, and it's hard to remember
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:12.960]  that back in 2007, 2008, 2009, these things were actually not great. They were all slow,
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.800]  and they all had weirdnesses with the interface, and they were all missing stuff that they
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:23.040]  obviously needed to do at some point. But with the original Pre, because they had a clean slate,
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.880]  they could launch with a complete thought of, here is this thing. Here's how it works. Here are a
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:36.080]  bunch of new ideas for what a phone can do and what its notifications should look like and what
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.960]  multitasking should look like. I don't want to say revolutionary. I'm not going to say that I
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:47.120]  don't think that people had thought of some of these ideas inside of Apple or Microsoft or Google,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.640]  but they were actually able to just make the thing and ship it instead of having
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.640]  an interesting UI idea and then putting it on the roadmap for three years down the road.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:02.800]  Yeah, it actually shipped. It wasn't just that, okay, sure, people at Apple and Google and Nokia
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:08.800]  had ideas for a modern notification UI, and it's on a whiteboard somewhere. This was something that
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.640]  actually shipped. Let me make sure I'm getting the timeline right. I know the timeline of the iPhone
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:22.880]  announced in January 2007, shipped at the end of June 2007, the original aluminum black iconic
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:30.000]  original iPhone. Then a year later, Apple came out with the iPhone 3G, which added, of course,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.080]  3G networking, but changed the form factor to this sort of crappy plastic back. To me,
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.520]  clearly the two worst iPhones of all time were the 3G in terms of industrial design.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:48.560]  3G and 3GS, those plastic ones. But that's 2008, and that came out in June too. I believe the
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:59.200]  pre came out in the spring of 2008. So it's 2009. They announced it at CES in 2009, the only good
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.040]  thing to ever come out of CES, and then it got released in June of that year. I forget the exact
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.520]  date, and I really should know it because it's like the thing you could punch in to turn on
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.920]  developer mode on it if you knew the launch date of the Palm Pre. So it was two years after the
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:20.880]  iPhone. But I knew it was June, though, because it's one of those memories I have where I know
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:31.040]  exactly where I was when I first got to play with a pre. I was at the beer bash at WWDC in June.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:37.280]  And I don't remember who had the pre, but we're there on that big grass lawn where they always
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:44.400]  used to have the beer bash when it was at Moscone. Somebody in a group of people I knew had the pre
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.960]  and was like, would you like to play with it? And I was like, yes. And that's all I remember.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:57.360]  It was like this experience of like the first time I saw the iPhone, I just couldn't possibly
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.880]  get enough time with it. The thing that hit me right when I started using it was,
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:12.560]  and I think it's true, is if you went back in time to the classic, let's say like 1998,
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.280]  when Steve Jobs was back, NeXT was back, but they were headed to the secret project they were
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:20.880]  working on that would become, well, it wasn't really a secret, but what was to become Mac OS
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.280]  10 was still years from shipping. And the state of the art from Apple was Mac OS 9.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:34.560]  And if you showed a Mac user of 1998 who was well-versed in Apple's aesthetics and taste
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:44.400]  and the way the Mac worked, if you showed them a 2009 iPhone and a 2009 Palm pre and asked them
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:50.720]  which one was the Apple phone, I think an awful lot of people, if not a majority would have
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:14:02.880]  guessed the pre. The pre was more aligned to the ideals and priorities of Apple in the classic
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:08.080]  Mac OS era than the iPhone. Yeah. Well, to be clear, there were a lot of Apple people working
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:12.880]  at Palm, not just John Rubensy, but so many engineers and so on that there was actually
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.640]  a fight between Steve Jobs and Ed Colligan over recruiting. Steve emailed Ed, it was like,
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.520]  you got to stop taking our people. And Ed wrote the email back that was like very clearly written
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.240]  to be found by lawyers in two years or whatever saying, as you know, we can't make these kinds
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.800]  of deals and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you also poach from us. So there was a lot of
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:40.160]  Apple DNA inside Palm at the time. Yeah, I know that. And designers too,
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.800]  and just down to the details of what like the icons look like and the style of the icons and
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.760]  the fact that they were all very consistent with each other and looked like they were all part of
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:58.800]  the same family was much more like classic Mac OS than the iPhone in the early days where the iPhone.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:07.680]  Yeah. And it obviously has worked out very well for Apple and the iPhone clearly evolved into
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.920]  becoming more of an independent, fully independent, for the most part computing system. But the
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:23.360]  original conception of the iPhone in the early years, 2007, 2008, 2009, was far less about having
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:29.920]  a computer, a personal computer system in your pocket. And it was much more of a, like an
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.560]  appliance. And I don't mean that to denigrate it. Obviously I liked it. It was my phone. I was very
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.360]  happy with it, but even something as simple as the fact that it took like, I think it was three
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.600]  years to get copy and paste because it wasn't that they didn't think of it. I mean, I've talked to
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.200]  people who were on the team at the time and they were like, yeah, of course we knew it needed copy
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:59.120]  and paste, but it was lower on our list of priorities than the X, Y, and Z, which they did
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:07.520]  first. Whereas the pre-launched with all sorts of stuff like that, multitasking, notifications,
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.120]  right? And the multitasking interface, well, what would it look like? It looked like cards that you
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:19.280]  shuffle through and they're in order, which is something that, you know, the way you multitask
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.680]  right now. And whether it was left to right or up and down or something like that, it's-
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.200]  Well, so actually with WebOS, people don't remember this, and this was something that
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.800]  if they had survived would have to have changed, I think. It was a spatial. So it was like Windows
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.960]  on your computer. If you launched the web browser and then launched the email app,
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.400]  those were running applications in theory that were next to each other,
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:47.120]  and you could move the cards around on your little deck in a spatial way. So whereas everything today
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.720]  is just reverse chronological, your cards are just listed over right to left or whatever.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.520]  It wasn't. It was like, actually like the new app could be on the right side or left side or
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.280]  in the middle or wherever. It was very weird. Yeah. The way things work now is most recently
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.640]  used, second most recently used, third most recently used. It's all about how recently
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:11.840]  you used it as opposed to the actual spatial metaphor. Yeah. The notifications would be very
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:19.520]  familiar to users of modern phones, except they came up at the bottom instead of the top.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:28.080]  But they very cleverly and to me in an Apple-like way would push the content up. So instead of
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:33.760]  covering content, if the notification was, I don't know, maybe they were 32 pixels high,
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:42.320]  it made the window shrink by 32 pixels to make room for it. Right. And it was a very
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:48.400]  modern notification system by today's standards at a time when the iPhone didn't have notifications
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.640]  at all. Yeah. More than anything else, it was a notification system that really sold me on this
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:59.840]  thing that maybe, oh, wow, they have thought through what it's like to use a smartphone.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:05.520]  There was also the Synergy idea, which was everything syncing over the air and they had
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.960]  the benefit of being able to put stuff into a single client, like a single messaging client
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.440]  or a single contacts app, stuff that we take for granted today. And they also had over the
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.720]  air updates, which I believe took a little while for the iPhone to actually get. You still had to
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:24.480]  plug it into iTunes to get your OS updates. But the thing about, maybe not notifications,
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:29.840]  but the thing about a lot of this stuff is remember that they didn't have a desktop OS.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:35.600]  This was their last shot. And so a lot of these things that seem like innovations now
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.960]  were born out of the fact that they didn't have any other choice. It was either create a desktop
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:45.680]  app and make you install that and sync and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it turns into this
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.000]  really weird hassle or they're building it from scratch. They might as well make it
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.480]  over the air completely because it's simpler for them and it's a selling point. They can move ahead
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.200]  and it's not like they had really any other choice. So a lot of the stuff that they did,
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.840]  including the fact that they based it on web technologies, there was a big internal debate
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.280]  whether to make some native code or based on web technologies. And at the end of the day,
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:15.040]  a lot of it was like, we need to get this thing out the door and we need to get developers to
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.640]  make stuff for this thing fast. So let's go with this. A lot of those choices were smart and
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:26.320]  interesting and clever, but also born out of necessity. But also really hurt them in terms
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:34.240]  of performance because web rendering, even today, it's always been, it is computationally expensive
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.400]  because no matter how fast our devices and computers get, web developers continually press
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:47.440]  the limits of it. And even when they had the control of the whole thing, because obviously
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:55.840]  they were writing their own apps, rendering stuff on mobile processors circa 2009 was expensive.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.720]  And so it was like, it's one of those things where in hindsight, they probably, because they
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.680]  were late, if they had shipped the Palm Pre even a year earlier, two years earlier, if they had
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.280]  been coincident with the iPhone, it could have been different, but it was too late and it was
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.240]  damned if they do damned if they don't. So they could ship sooner by building on a web stack,
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.680]  but then their performance would suffer and, or they could have gone native like the iPhone did,
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.600]  but they would have had to build out an entire native OS user environment.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.880]  Yeah. Well, it would have slowed down adoption from developers. They actually did a really good
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.440]  job with developers early on, but even so it was slow, but it wasn't that much worse than what you
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:42.640]  got on an Android phone or even the iPhone a little bit at the time. And so the thing to
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:49.360]  remember back then is the only thing that mattered to the rest of the phone industry that wasn't AT&T
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:56.480]  was can we find an iPhone killer? That phrase iPhone killer haunted the entire tech industry
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:03.040]  outside of Apple for years because the thing was exclusive to Singular and Verizon, especially
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:10.400]  Verizon needed something. And they took a shot on Blackberry. They made this phone called the Storm,
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.320]  which was an utter fiasco. It like the whole screen was a push button. It was a terrible joke.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.000]  So that that flopped. And so then Verizon is like, okay, well, let's try again. We got to
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:28.800]  find our iPhone killer. And they played off Palm, who was put together a huge glut of inventory to
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.440]  sell through to Verizon for the pre plus where the processor was a little bit faster and the OS had
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.800]  been updated. So it wasn't quite so dog slow. And it was going to be the thing. But unbeknownst to
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:44.400]  them, Google had teamed up with Motorola to make the Droid and make the Droid like a flagship
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:51.680]  device. And at the 11th hour, Verizon tapped Motorola, and the Droid became the thing that
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:56.080]  basically made Android succeed, but also became like the iPhone killer. And Palm was stuck with
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.200]  yet again, a bunch of phones that they couldn't sell. And they weren't doing that well financially
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:06.720]  in the first place. And that was the thing that ultimately put them under. It persisted for a
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.640]  while longer. They sold HP, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that moment right there
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.960]  is, to me, like the final thing where Palm just could not recover from it.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:25.120]  And it's another similarity to Apple of the 90s, right? Where inventory was a huge problem for
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.960]  Apple throughout the 90s and a big part of how they got into such dire financial straits. And
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.280]  everybody thinks it was purely about market share, but the inventory thing was killer. And long story
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:42.400]  short, what Apple had was a bunch of salespeople whose jobs were measured by how much stuff they
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.840]  put into the quote unquote channel. And at the end of quarters, they would just dump all this
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.360]  Mac hardware into the channel. And there might be new products coming in the next quarter,
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.680]  yet they had all these old ones that were already out there. And that sort of thing,
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.240]  like building out, it sounds so simple, like why would you do that? But that's where,
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.080]  by today's standards, even Apple at that time was a very small company. Palm was even smaller.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:13.280]  And having channel inventory like that, it was financial death.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.120]  Yeah. And in theory, again, at the time we didn't know how many players would be in the
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.960]  smartphone market. If you could get by with a few percent market share, just keep making phones and
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.120]  it would have been fine. They could have maybe persisted longer, but they were stuck in a money
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.360]  pit. Actually, I told this story at our 10 year party, but I'll just repeat it here. So the Droid
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.320]  being the thing that killed Palm is hilarious because the Droid's product manager was Rick
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:47.360]  Osterlo, who got his start making the MP3 sounds good module for the handspring visor. And then
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:52.560]  they pivoted to push email. They got bought by Motorola. He convinced Motorola to make the Droid.
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.600]  They made the Droid, the Droid killed Palm. And now he is, he runs the Pixel team, right?
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.840]  Yep. That's right. Google. I remember going when the Droid launched
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:11.920]  and going to New York for something and I always take the train from Philly and it was like,
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:17.360]  I still to this day don't think I've ever seen an ad campaign so saturated the way that
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.880]  Midtown Manhattan and all of Penn Station, there was nothing but Droid, Droid, Droid, Droid.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.000]  It was like, it was almost like something out of a minority report. And there was a glitch in
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.200]  the system that everywhere, no matter where I turned my head, I was being bombarded with
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.440]  a message from Verizon and Motorola that the Droid is here. Well, and man, that ad campaign
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.880]  was also so cynical. The amount of money they pumped into it, the phone was very good. It was
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.960]  a good phone. Don't get me wrong. It had turn by turn directions, which was a first for phones at
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.040]  the time. It had a really cool industrial design, but the cynicism of like, they specifically
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:05.200]  gendered it as like the manly dude phone, the like cool brolly, just great phone that was for guys
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.080]  and everybody who doesn't use a Droid as a feat or whatever. It was just an incredibly offensive
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.880]  campaign, but just cynical because like they knew where they were going to get their first bump of
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.840]  users. And they were just unapologetic at making a super cynical offensive campaign to go get those
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.240]  people because they had to, if Verizon didn't have something that they could say, well, we've got
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:29.520]  this. They were, they were looking at a world of hurt. So they just, they threw everything at it.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:38.640]  It is funny. And it was a very masculine brand undeniably. And it played poorly at the time of
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:46.320]  2009 or 2010, whenever it was. But in hindsight, it feels 11 years later here in 2021, it, the idea
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:54.960]  of a masculine branded flagship phone campaign feels, it feels like it might as well be as old
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:00.720]  as those advertisements where a doctor, a family doctor was telling you that you should smoke
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:06.880]  camels because they soothe your throat. Yeah. Yeah. I smoked camels and you should too,
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:11.280]  says family doctor, whatever his name is. That's what it feels like. It's like, my God,
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.000]  what a ridiculous ad campaign. Yeah, but it was a good product. It was like the first
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.520]  actually truly good Android phone. Apologies to HTC for the, the G1 and the, the dream and
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.640]  whatever the other ones out there were, but it was, it was like the phone where Android was
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.920]  ready for mass market and had a differentiating feature that nobody else had. And that's,
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.880]  that's what made that thing a success. Yeah. Famously. Well, famously in our circle,
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:42.240]  Android was originally conceived as a sort of blackberry-ish operating system where you would
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:46.640]  have a keyboard and there are a couple of prototypes have leaked, leaked over the years.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.720]  And like with the HTC G1, which was the first one, it clearly, it was like having three little kids
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:58.880]  on each other's shoulders in a trench coat. It was, it was a blackberry style OS dressed
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.520]  up as an iPhone style OS. And it was very clear and it was around the time of the droid is when
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:10.320]  Android finally started feeling, okay, yeah, this is actually the way you're, this is what
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:15.840]  the system is designed to handle now. Yeah. But it still had a five-way D-pad on the keyboard
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.240]  underneath on the droid. But before that a bunch of Android phones had track balls because blackberry
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.760]  had had a lot of success with its track balls. So they figured, yeah, I guess that's what phones
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.480]  need is a glowing white track ball in the middle of the bottom of the phone. So they would include
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.800]  those on them too. I seem to recall that some of the early phones, you actually had to use
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.160]  the track ball to move the cursor while you were editing texts. Like there was no touch interface
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.600]  for that. You had to either, either you had to, or at least you wanted to because the touchscreen
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.560]  was so not good for moving the insertion point. Yeah, that feels right. And that,
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:53.520]  that's one of those things where I'm pretty sure Apple had a patent on the magnifying glass for
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.600]  text selection. I don't know, man, the way text selection works on modern iOS, I just like,
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.960]  why did you had such a great idea there? Like, why, why did you let it go? I miss it. I miss,
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.480]  I miss text selection. It's weird. Cause it's, you know, you can drag stuff around and copy
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:12.000]  and paste is a little bit nicer or whatever, but I would say it's, I've got a 50% hit rate on
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.840]  text selection, doing what I want it to, although part of this is on me because the way it works on
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.280]  Android versus iPhone is just different enough where I catch myself using the wrong method on
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:31.840]  either phone. So I, I just, I don't think anybody's licked it yet. I, I, without betraying any
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:37.840]  confidences, I know somebody who at some point within that last handful of years ran into Scott
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.960]  Forstall somewhere and you know, they're just shooting the shit and it came up. Like one of
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:47.680]  the things that came up was, yeah, we never got text selection, right. And somehow even in the
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.680]  years since Forstall was forced out of Apple that they still haven't gotten it right. Like
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.760]  it, and it's one of those things that again, if you'd gone back and told me this in 1998,
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:04.240]  as a Mac user, that 20, 23 years from now, Apple's going to be the most profitable cell phone maker
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:12.880]  in the world with something broadly akin to a Macintosh in your pocket with a touch screen.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:16.800]  I would have thought, well, and that everybody else uses phones like this too, in a way that
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.960]  Windows is like the Mac and it's all with a touch screen. And I would have said, well,
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:27.200]  I'll bet Apple's version has the best text selection. Because it's the sort of thing
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.480]  that in that time, Apple always would get right. And they wouldn't ship without getting it right.
[01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:40.160]  And somehow some of those details like that, they're just not high. Apple today has different
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:46.480]  priorities and it is more of a simplistic, it still is to this day, more of a simplistic
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.680]  appliance-like attitude. And that's one of those things too, where again, I don't want to go off
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:58.320]  on a whole side tangent about using iPad for work, but when I do spend more time than I should,
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.840]  productivity-wise, trying to write or do something on an iPad, when I go back to my Mac,
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.400]  it really is that ice, ice water and hell feeling of, oh my God, it's so easy to select text
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:14.400]  precisely. I don't know, maybe in 20 years, we'll think of having good text selection as being
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.600]  quaint and unnecessary because we're all just communicating via short videos or something.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:23.440]  It's no guarantee that there is an answer for good text selection with your finger
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.880]  on a capacitive touch screen. It's possible. It just might not exist.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.680]  Right. It is possible that that's why we don't have it. I don't know.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.960]  But we certainly don't have it yet. And I also think though that Apple has taken regression. So
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.760]  they've gone back to the magnifying glass, but I think it was last year, iOS 14, they got rid of
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.440]  the magnifying glass. And I thought that was crazy. It was like, you guys had this great thing.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:50.320]  They even, and like you said, they even sued other companies over patents for it. And then they got
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:57.040]  rid of it. I guess the thinking was, hey, we've gotten so good at just using your finger. We don't
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:03.520]  need the magnifying glass anymore. That's a, that's a kludge. And it was like a rare case of
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.160]  Apple convincing themselves of something that wasn't true. Like the fundamental truth is that
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:15.440]  when you're using your finger and you're covering the thing, you can't do, I do think there's no
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:21.600]  reliable way to do it without something to show you what you're selecting under your finger,
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:27.760]  because your finger covers, it covers it. It's so obvious. Like they even explained this in 2007,
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.000]  like on stage with the original iPhone. Well, your finger covers what you're looking at. So
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.840]  here we have a magnifying glass above your finger. I did get used to dragging my finger
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.960]  along the keyboard to move the cursor around. And I, I think that's the primary way I move
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:44.960]  the cursor around, at least on short text now. Yeah. Yeah. For anybody who doesn't know this,
[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.560]  this is whenever I mentioned it, there's always somebody who doesn't know about this, but
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.720]  when you're editing text on the iPhone, if you press and hold on the space bar
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:32:00.000]  on the virtual keyboard, it turns the keyboard into a track pad and you can precisely move the
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.080]  thing around. I just saw, I think it was nine to five Mac. Somebody had a column today
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.400]  about how they missed 3d touch and I want to link to it because I do too. It, all of this has gotten
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.240]  worse since they've gotten rid of 3d touch because when they had 3d touch in the screen,
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.240]  I know that there's like tricks you can do with by adding a second finger to like select texts
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.960]  and stuff. But like the closest we got to good tech selection on an iPhone was when they had
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:31.040]  3d touch because you could press and hold anywhere on the keyboard to turn it into the track pad,
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:35.680]  not just the space bar. And then as you move the insertion point around, you could just press
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:41.920]  harder and begin a text selection like using a track pad. You could click. I get it. I'm the
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.520]  commotion on this one. I don't think that juice was ever worth the squeeze on 3d touch. I'm sorry.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.040]  Like it is on a track pad on a Mac. There's there's stuff there. Although I bring that
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:54.560]  dictionary up so often, it drives me nuts, but I just don't think they ever got enough value out
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.920]  of it relative to a long press to make it worth it. And I don't know whatever, whatever money
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:05.680]  they're saving on it, whatever Z thickness we get back from it. I, I just think it was it.
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.520]  They, they talked themselves into like, there's, there's a lot of like interaction potential here
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.120]  and we can do a lot of new stuff with it. And they came up with a few things, but I don't think
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:18.320]  enough people used it. And I'm, I'm the one who says it's fine to let it go. Me and Apple were
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:23.520]  the only two that don't miss it. I, well, I, I guess I could be convinced that they made the
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:28.880]  right trade-offs, but it doesn't mean I still don't miss it. Sure. Right. That maybe like you
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:36.400]  said, Z thickness and cost and whatever else, maybe the trade-off was right, but I still miss
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:43.360]  it because I, and I still wish that somehow when and specifically, and only in the context of text
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.480]  selection. And I guess maybe that's, and again, it's obviously never been a very high priority
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:53.680]  for Apple. They didn't have copy and paste for three years. It's, it's never been about being a
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:59.440]  great text editing environment. Yeah. Well, I think that for, for Apple, it's, that's not
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:04.960]  what it's for, for, for, for awhile. And I don't know, with iMessage and with texting, they've done
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:10.160]  a better job, but I don't think that if you are, if you're looking to enter a bunch of texts,
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.680]  you're, you're looking to write a novel, you're going to want a physical QWERTY keyboard. That's
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:20.880]  just how it goes. Yeah. So wrapping things up, do you think that I, I, I do think to,
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.360]  to rewind an hour, I do think fundamentally Palm was probably doomed, even if they'd come
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:32.240]  out earlier, I think these two platform things probably are inevitable. I don't know. It's hard
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:38.800]  to say, but there's, if there was an alternate world where Palm could have become maybe what
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:46.960]  the Macintosh was and still is to the PC market, like a solid 5% of devoted users and enough to,
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.000]  to be a thriving business, boy, the world would be a better place. That is the best I think they
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.400]  could have hoped for. The answer, does it have to be duopoly as well? Let's find a counterfactual
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:02.000]  in terms of like consumer platforms. And I guess you could argue that we, we got to a point where
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.560]  Chrome OS and a little bit of Linux have carved out a space next to Mac and windows and throw some
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.680]  iPad there on the side, but it's a stretch. And I think that the, the real thing, just like
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.000]  Verizon picking the droid is what, you know, ultimately put the nail in the coffin for Palm,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:26.640]  like the market forces here are such that unless you're a small company can have some sort of
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.720]  leverage over the ecosystem, over carriers in particular, even with Apple breaking that
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.280]  dominance a little bit, unless they could have found a way to have enough leverage to
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.560]  make sure carriers didn't screw with them or ignore them, they were doomed. And that's,
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:48.720]  that's just Google got big enough and Apple got big enough where they could keep AT&T from screwing
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.520]  it up. And I think that's, that's good. I maybe the best analogy, and I'll bet there's a bunch
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:36:00.240]  of listeners in their heads who are like screaming this game consoles, right? Where we've got three,
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:08.400]  we've got two big ones, the Xbox and PlayStation, and Nintendo has succeeded. And especially with
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.200]  the switch, which I think is their biggest hit ever, or certainly, I don't know if it's,
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:19.040]  I wonder which is bigger. It's possible that if you take all the DS's and put them together,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.880]  that maybe it's still bigger than the switch. I would have to look it up, but it's huge. It's
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:30.960]  a solid third place. And they ha and, and it's probably the role that in the best case scenario
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:37.040]  where Palm had made it they'd be like to the phone platforms with the switch is to PlayStation
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:45.440]  and Xbox third place, but with the most devoted fans. Yeah. But look like LG just bombed out of
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:49.680]  the smartphone business this year and they just made Android phones, right? They weren't great,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.560]  but they were passable and there's still space at the low end to make decent phones for sub 500
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:00.000]  bucks. That's basically all Motorola really does now. But if LG can't make it in the smartphone
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.600]  market, what chance would a company that has a completely other OS platform have in 2022?
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:13.040]  I just don't see it. Yeah. I think it's doubtful. Well, thank you for being here. Happy new year.
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:18.320]  Yeah, you too. It'll be better. Yeah. And I told everybody two weeks ago to watch springboard.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:22.560]  You can watch it's free on YouTube, right? I'll put a link in the show notes to the general magic
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.960]  movie, which was about general magic, which is worth watching too. But springboard you should
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.360]  watch first. If you haven't watched it already and shame on you who haven't watched it. Cause
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:38.160]  I told you two weeks ago to watch it before this show. It's really good. And it's, it is a fast 30
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:46.240]  minutes. It is so good. I also, I love, Oh, I got to mention this. I love that you used the actual
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:53.200]  bitmap Palm font for the springboard. Oh my God. I would've, I would've, I would've been so mad at
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.760]  myself if I didn't bring this up. And that's the other thing that to me was always very Apple-like
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:05.440]  about the Palm OS was it had beautiful bitmap fonts. Oh, they were, they were just terrific
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.240]  that the small text editing font, the bold one that you've got the title for springboard in
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:16.720]  just beautiful pixel fonts. Hey man, what do you got? What do you got 160 by 160? Nothing to do,
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.960]  but get it right. And they got it right. Well, Microsoft had small screens like that too,
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:29.200]  and they still shipped crap. It's an art form and Palm had it right. They were beautiful. And I love
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.320]  that. That's what you use for the title, the title card of the movie. It's it's so sets the
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.720]  mood at least for me. It's Oh yeah, this is going to be good. Yeah. Well, I can't take credit for
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.640]  that. I got to give credit to all the, all the designers on the, the verge video team. They're
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:46.320]  the ones who really made this thing good. And in addition to being entertaining, it is a good
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.200]  looking movie. It really is. You guys didn't even talk about the, the Steve jobs meeting. That's
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.720]  sort of the middle of it. You'll have to go watch it. You'll see. I don't want to spoil it. I don't
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:59.280]  want to spoil it, but it's, it is, it's a good story. Anyway, Dieter, it's always good to have
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:03.440]  you here. Have a good new year. Have a good that remote CES and talk to you. Talk to you
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:16.720]  sometime soon. I'm going to take it easy.
