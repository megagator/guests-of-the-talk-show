[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Hello there
[00:02.440 --> 00:04.200]  Hello
[00:04.200 --> 00:06.200]  How was the Yankee game?
[00:07.880 --> 00:09.880]  It was
[00:10.440 --> 00:13.240]  Emotional and then it was extraordinarily disappointing
[00:13.840 --> 00:19.400]  And because I was at the Yankee game today, I probably gonna sound like I've taken the chain smoking
[00:22.040 --> 00:27.620]  Well, you know they they they can set up the special events, but they can't usually can't fix the outcome
[00:27.620 --> 00:30.060]  No, you know it
[00:31.820 --> 00:33.700]  I'm not gonna go all baseball
[00:33.700 --> 00:36.840]  We've got tons and tons of nerd stuff to talk about but it you know
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.000]  It was bad that I don't even know why I haven't because it's funny when you go to a game
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.380]  Sometimes you don't you know and like the cell phone reception is bad because there's 48,000 people all trying to use the same network and
[00:48.300 --> 00:51.820]  So I didn't follow the Twitter. I don't I didn't follow any of the Yankee beat writers
[00:51.820 --> 00:53.820]  I don't know what the explanation is, but
[00:53.820 --> 00:59.240]  The Yankees designated hitter today was Steven Drew who's hitting?
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.500]  160 and has five home runs on the season
[01:03.620 --> 01:06.140]  They like picked him out of like off waivers
[01:06.660 --> 01:10.840]  Like three weeks ago and they never pinch it for me. They got to the end of the game
[01:10.840 --> 01:15.580]  They had a man on first they're down by two and drew is up again and there's nobody on the bench
[01:15.580 --> 01:18.020]  And this is after the the roster expansion
[01:18.780 --> 01:21.660]  That's how that's how bad Yankees
[01:21.660 --> 01:27.820]  That reminds me as a fan of a National League team. This happens a lot when National League teams again. Yes
[01:27.820 --> 01:31.580]  We're talking about baseball when nationally teams try to play in the American League
[01:31.580 --> 01:34.960]  Sometimes they're like they're designated hitter is just some guy
[01:34.960 --> 01:41.080]  We're like literally the fourth outfielder because they don't have a designated hitter. So they're like, I don't know this guy
[01:42.780 --> 01:48.300]  But there's like designate a classic designated hitter is David Ortiz from the Red Sox right guy
[01:48.300 --> 01:54.260]  Who's always gonna try to knock the the the hide off the ball and just hit it hard and probably a good hitter
[01:54.260 --> 01:57.820]  But at least also a power hitter, but in theory though
[01:57.820 --> 02:01.820]  You could put anybody there like you could put ichiro there and he's not a power hitter
[02:01.820 --> 02:06.540]  But if you hadn't, you know, you're like he's not you're like ninth best hitter, right?
[02:09.260 --> 02:16.060]  Just so bad if they were if the New York Yankees this year were the Minnesota Twins or the
[02:16.060 --> 02:22.060]  The Cleveland Indians or name any other team from you know, somewhere in the middle of the country. No offense to those teams
[02:22.060 --> 02:29.460]  I'm just saying a team that's not a perennial powerhouse and they had this record and they had this lineup and these starting pitchers and
[02:29.660 --> 02:35.100]  Nobody would be paying any attention to them all it would be a curiosity that they're theoretically still in the wildcard race
[02:35.100 --> 02:40.820]  Yes, but nobody would even know there wouldn't be like nightly updates on ESPN about their where they are in the wildcard race
[02:40.820 --> 02:46.060]  It's just because of the Yankees and because there's one particular guy on the roster named Derek Jeter
[02:46.900 --> 02:52.860]  Right, which was the I mean, that's kind of the point of today. So, you know, but it's true. They're they're not
[02:53.380 --> 02:54.500]  They're one of those teams
[02:54.500 --> 02:59.320]  I noticed that the Padres are like six games out or something in the wildcard and it's like the
[02:59.620 --> 03:04.740]  technically in it still kind of category where people aren't really paying attention, but
[03:05.700 --> 03:09.500]  Something magical could happen, but probably won't but could yeah
[03:09.500 --> 03:11.300]  um
[03:11.300 --> 03:13.220]  Yeah, probably not. I'm a little worried
[03:13.220 --> 03:17.100]  I got a little worried by the end of the game that it's because I think they're five games over
[03:17.420 --> 03:21.500]  500 and I actually think that that's a remarkable achievement given what's happened to them
[03:21.500 --> 03:23.900]  They've had four out of their five starting pitchers on opening day
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.060]  Had like season ending injuries or almost as an ending injuries Panetta was out. I don't know four months
[03:31.460 --> 03:35.940]  Well, it's remarkable that the team with four out of their five starting pitchers having season ending
[03:35.940 --> 03:42.340]  Would possibly career ending in the case of CC. Sabathia injuries is five games over 500. That's remarkable
[03:42.340 --> 03:48.060]  but here's the thing I the the takeaway I came from today where I was I left the Yankee Stadium very depressed and my thought is
[03:48.980 --> 03:51.700]  Everybody's hoping that Jeter at least gets to finish the season
[03:52.140 --> 03:53.860]  May be chasing down a wild card
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.860]  My fear is that he's gonna finish the season chasing down the first ever losing season that he's had as a Yankee
[03:59.860 --> 04:05.060]  It could happen but they you know that again they could be you know, sometimes
[04:05.820 --> 04:10.300]  Again, it depends on what your what your expectations are. I remember that there's a period in the
[04:11.740 --> 04:19.300]  Early 2000s when the Giants were I think they played like five or six years where they had like three games where they were eliminated
[04:19.300 --> 04:25.260]  And most of those years, you know, the Giants have I think never won the division two years in a row ever
[04:25.260 --> 04:31.420]  But there was something good about that that they they would get eliminated the last week of the season and
[04:31.740 --> 04:33.740]  Even if they didn't win the division of the wild card
[04:33.900 --> 04:40.100]  They they weren't playing meaningless games to late September and I realize that's in some ways a low bar
[04:40.100 --> 04:45.180]  But I do kind of like that the idea that you're always around and maybe some years you fall short and you're five games
[04:45.180 --> 04:46.180]  Out or whatever at the end
[04:46.180 --> 04:52.380]  but but you know when when that all sort of fell apart and there were a couple years there where they were out in like
[04:52.380 --> 04:57.620]  The end of August it felt really strange because that's the thing you get used to is, you know, at least we're in it
[04:57.620 --> 05:03.580]  We might not make it but we're in it till almost. It's the end of the you know, it's the football season
[05:03.580 --> 05:07.420]  It doesn't matter anymore. Yeah, I actually that was actually one of the reasons
[05:07.420 --> 05:13.340]  I think as a boy that I became a Dallas Cowboys fan and one of my favorite things about my the Tom Landry era
[05:13.340 --> 05:17.740]  Dallas Cowboys was that I believe the number is 20 that they had 20 consecutive
[05:17.740 --> 05:23.980]  Winning seasons where they won at least nine out of the 16 games, right? And during that era clearly
[05:23.980 --> 05:29.900]  The dominant team in that era was the Pittsburgh Steelers the Steelers. I don't think yeah, you know the the Cowboys
[05:29.900 --> 05:34.700]  I think took one from the Steelers but the Steelers beat the Cowboys more than the you know
[05:34.700 --> 05:37.580]  the other way around and they won four in a row and
[05:38.460 --> 05:44.780]  You know you you could argue then that afterwards that the 49ers supplanted the Cowboys the the Joe Montana era
[05:44.780 --> 05:51.820]  The Joe Montana era 49ers and literally in one game, you know, there was like a passing of the torch with the catch
[05:52.260 --> 05:58.400]  But the thing about that that 20 consecutive winning seasons to me is that's that's an incredible thing
[05:58.580 --> 06:02.540]  You know, that's like an amazing consistency. I think with Jeter I again
[06:02.540 --> 06:05.460]  I'm just talking off the cuff here, but I believe and at one point I know it was true
[06:05.660 --> 06:08.900]  Don't count last year because he only played 17 years because of the ankle
[06:08.900 --> 06:15.780]  But in all the game all the seasons he's had full seasons with the Yankees. He's only played one meaningless game
[06:16.620 --> 06:20.580]  One time the last and it was the last ever game at Yankee Stadium
[06:21.420 --> 06:24.620]  The the old Yankee Stadium, so it wasn't even meaningless
[06:24.620 --> 06:28.600]  It was that that was the one game where they were now they're technically out of the playoffs
[06:28.900 --> 06:34.300]  But it was the last game at the house that Ruth built so you could argue that it wasn't meaningless
[06:34.300 --> 06:37.260]  it was actually very emotional and Jeter gave a speech to a
[06:37.260 --> 06:41.900]  Completely sold-out completely, you know emotional crowd
[06:42.740 --> 06:46.660]  That's why didn't it and that's a 20-year career. That's the magic of yeah
[06:46.660 --> 06:50.820]  I think there's I think there's something we said for being in it and and like I said
[06:51.740 --> 06:56.340]  That was a great era for the Giants when they when you could count on on
[06:56.860 --> 07:02.460]  Maybe one hand the number of meaningless games that they played over a course of like four or five years and they didn't win
[07:03.100 --> 07:06.020]  Actually, you know, they've got to the World Series one of those years and the rest of them
[07:06.020 --> 07:09.220]  I think they went to playoffs once and the rest of them they didn't even make the playoffs
[07:09.220 --> 07:13.660]  But it was that thing of like you weren't playing out the string you were you were at the games were meaningful
[07:13.660 --> 07:15.500]  And even if you ended up on the wrong side of them
[07:15.500 --> 07:21.500]  They were meaningful and that I know that sounds strange for especially if you're like well a championship is the only thing that'll that'll do
[07:21.500 --> 07:24.140]  But there is something to going to a game and saying hey
[07:24.140 --> 07:30.820]  Maybe something magical could happen here versus like literally these are two teams that are going nowhere and don't care anymore. Yeah
[07:30.820 --> 07:38.860]  That's the worst. It is. Absolutely. It's the Astros playing the Padres and yeah, but it's you know, that's baseball, you know
[07:38.860 --> 07:41.180]  And that's what that's, you know, it's a sport where and you know
[07:41.180 --> 07:43.720]  We can get into complaints about the wild card and everything
[07:43.720 --> 07:47.660]  But it's still even with the wild card and even with the expansion of the wild card. It's still a sport
[07:47.660 --> 07:53.180]  We're just making it to the postseason a special like I can't I can't I can't fathom the sports like the NBA
[07:53.700 --> 07:56.340]  Where it's almost hard not to make the playoffs
[07:56.340 --> 08:01.380]  You know where it's just about seeding and like clearing out the absolute dregs, right?
[08:02.260 --> 08:05.620]  And then you all play, you know, then then you're in a tournament you might as well
[08:05.620 --> 08:09.620]  There's that one year where I think the NHL came back from a strike and they literally just did a tournament
[08:10.980 --> 08:13.500]  We give up who needs a season
[08:15.740 --> 08:17.540]  Anyway busy week ahead
[08:17.540 --> 08:21.200]  It's gonna be huge. I don't even know where to start. I think it's
[08:21.200 --> 08:28.280]  So we're recording Sunday night. We're gonna air this tomorrow. There's people be listening on Monday
[08:28.280 --> 08:34.280]  I think this is probably one of those episodes where people won't won't wait around if you did and you waited around then you're listening
[08:34.280 --> 08:40.100]  To it after the fact, but those of you listening on Monday the 9th of September to 2014
[08:41.840 --> 08:44.400]  We're talking the prelude to apples big
[08:44.400 --> 08:50.280]  Well, we don't know what event but we can make some some pretty good guesses
[08:51.160 --> 08:57.140]  It's gone for everybody thought it was going to be an iPhone event and maybe something else too. It's quickly zeroed into
[08:59.080 --> 09:01.080]  iPhones to iPhones and
[09:01.640 --> 09:03.640]  quote-unquote a wearable, right
[09:04.240 --> 09:06.160]  Which is funny because this is the event
[09:06.160 --> 09:07.640]  we always think of as the
[09:07.640 --> 09:12.680]  iPhone event and the iPhone is Apple's biggest product and this is by any measure and I you know
[09:12.680 --> 09:16.840]  I can only look at like I know what the Mac world traffic is like for the last few years and
[09:17.460 --> 09:19.600]  People talk about Oh Apple events are big
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.600]  The iPhone event is of a scale in terms of just general interest on the web
[09:23.880 --> 09:26.480]  That is beyond any other Apple of out of the year
[09:26.480 --> 09:32.720]  The iPhone event always pins the needle in a way that an iPad event or a WWDC keynote
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.720]  Just doesn't I mean and so it's fascinating that everybody's suddenly like talking about the wearable thing
[09:38.720 --> 09:45.120]  Because without it, this would still be the biggest Apple event of the year. Yes. That's absolutely true
[09:46.120 --> 09:47.240]  and
[09:47.240 --> 09:53.000]  I think what's weird about that. I was just talking offline with
[09:53.840 --> 09:58.720]  Dave off the show not on the show, but with my friend Dave whiskus about this over the weekend and
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.060]  We were talking about with with this the rumors that there's going to be a wearable announcement called the watch or whatever
[10:06.060 --> 10:12.420]  Kind of thing it is. It doesn't really matter. But the the rumor is that they're going to announce it and then
[10:13.820 --> 10:18.060]  It won't it may not ship right away may not even ship in calendar 2014
[10:18.220 --> 10:21.940]  They might just be for whatever reason and we've got to speculating
[10:21.940 --> 10:25.280]  Well, why would they pre announced something if it wasn't ready to go on sale yet?
[10:26.140 --> 10:27.980]  and in
[10:27.980 --> 10:34.540]  2007 when the only time they really I can remember them ever doing that like a significant lead time was with the original iPhone
[10:34.540 --> 10:40.740]  Yeah, yeah, whether where that was the Macworld Expo in January and it didn't ship till the July
[10:41.380 --> 10:48.220]  Or was it June 27th? It was summer. It was it was and it was late June if it was June
[10:48.220 --> 10:50.620]  I think it was like June 28th or so into June, right?
[10:50.820 --> 10:54.300]  This is why we need a chat room because of course, there's somebody out there who's you know
[10:54.300 --> 10:57.980]  I I remember that because my family and I were going to summer camp and we made the
[10:58.020 --> 11:02.500]  Reservations like a year in advance and I got the iPhone the day we were supposed to leave for summer camp
[11:02.500 --> 11:04.580]  And so I reviewed the iPhone in a tent. I
[11:05.540 --> 11:12.060]  You know, what's funny? I I went with Amy and and her some of her family to the shore in
[11:14.140 --> 11:17.420]  We are my friend my first side of the family always goes to Jersey Shore
[11:17.420 --> 11:21.220]  This was Ocean City, Maryland where I'd never even been before the next day
[11:21.220 --> 11:28.020]  so it was like I had stayed up all night and wrote like a first thought and then we went to the shore and I was
[11:28.020 --> 11:31.900]  I have to I think I try to be a good, you know
[11:32.820 --> 11:38.620]  Vacationer, you know don't don't stay, you know attached to the internet and you know the stuff
[11:38.620 --> 11:43.220]  I usually do when I'm with my family, but with a brand new iPhone it was impossible
[11:43.220 --> 11:48.620]  It was impossible to think of anything other than the iPhone that was in my hand. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[11:48.620 --> 11:52.100]  I had to we and we had no cell service at the camp
[11:52.100 --> 11:58.580]  So I actually I had to drive like 40 minutes down the mountainside to test like the phone part of it
[11:58.580 --> 11:59.780]  But but it was definitely summer
[11:59.780 --> 12:05.900]  It was one of those things that like Apple is ruining every every buddy's summer vacation because that was late June and yeah
[12:05.900 --> 12:10.820]  Yeah, and if you were gonna extend like a weekend trip to like the 4th of July, it was right smack dab there
[12:10.820 --> 12:13.340]  Yeah, but that's six months six full months, right?
[12:13.340 --> 12:16.740]  I remember your review your review when you say you had no cell service
[12:16.740 --> 12:20.420]  You don't mean like it was like one bar or whatever. It was I don't know surface
[12:20.420 --> 12:25.260]  You know the little thing that says no surface right didn't even have the AT&T logo. No, no
[12:25.260 --> 12:27.620]  It was a complete complete empty avoid
[12:27.620 --> 12:28.300]  And so yeah
[12:28.300 --> 12:34.180]  I went down the mountain about 25 minutes and and and sat pulled over by the side of the road basically when I had
[12:34.500 --> 12:36.420]  like a bar and
[12:36.420 --> 12:39.940]  Made a couple of calls and did some data just it was ridiculous
[12:39.940 --> 12:45.620]  but that was that was how I can always remember that it was summer vacation right around the end of June beginning of July and
[12:45.860 --> 12:49.620]  And that was despite the fact that the event was Mac World Expo. So that was early January
[12:49.620 --> 12:52.620]  So there's a huge process but that allowed them to keep it secret, right?
[12:52.620 --> 12:55.900]  Which I think is the scenario here with this wearable is that we all know
[12:56.460 --> 13:00.860]  I mean not to get into more anecdotes, but like I remember you went to New York
[13:00.860 --> 13:05.660]  I was since I'm in California. I went to Cupertino, but they did those briefings for Mountain Lion and
[13:06.820 --> 13:09.580]  everybody walked into those briefings and basically
[13:10.460 --> 13:15.380]  was like what the hell are you guys talking about because there had been no rumors about it that there was gonna be a new
[13:15.380 --> 13:21.060]  Version of OS X that soon and I remember running into MG Sigler afterward and we looked at each other and both kind of mouthed
[13:21.060 --> 13:25.940]  Oh my god, right and that's because you know, Cupertino's pretty locked down
[13:25.940 --> 13:32.260]  And so the iPhone was pretty locked down because it wasn't in the supply chain yet and so many of these leaks like about the iPhone
[13:32.260 --> 13:37.720]  6 come from the supply chain and this wearable isn't in the supply chain yet and we people talk about FCC
[13:37.720 --> 13:45.080]  Approvals leaking things and that that may be true. But also like if you announce it early enough, it's not outside
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.120]  Cupertino and
[13:47.120 --> 13:51.640]  Maybe maybe you know some theoretical parts are but the whole product is not in production
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.200]  And that means they can make that splash and that you could only do that once right? Yeah
[13:56.200 --> 14:02.640]  That's exactly the point that the I was making over the weekend privately. Is that Steve Jobs? This is and this is
[14:02.640 --> 14:10.200]  What was thrown in my face was well Steve Jobs said in 2007 that the reason they were pre-announcing the iPhone was FCC
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.400]  They didn't want to have it come out through FCC regulations. They're gonna announce it now
[14:14.400 --> 14:19.860]  They're gonna put it through the regulatory process. They're gonna put it through the carrier testing process with with singular
[14:20.520 --> 14:26.560]  And that would spoil the secret and they wanted to show it to us now and it's not quite finished software wise and but well
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.560]  You know, we'll be ready in in six months
[14:28.560 --> 14:32.360]  and that that wouldn't apply to a wearable because a wearable wouldn't need to
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.800]  Get all the same regulatory stuff that a cell phone was which I don't know is true
[14:36.800 --> 14:42.120]  Actually, I think maybe it does if it has I don't know what the regulations I think it's got radios in it
[14:42.120 --> 14:43.640]  It has to write some sort of process
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.480]  Yeah, if it has, you know this NFC or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or has to have some kind of connectivity presumably
[14:50.680 --> 14:54.800]  but I think it's more than that though see here's I think there's a huge difference between
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.480]  2014 and
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.120]  2007 which is in
[14:59.120 --> 15:03.080]  2007 as big a deal as Steve Jobs keynotes were to
[15:03.400 --> 15:08.520]  Guys like me and you people who listen to this show people who read Macworld and during fireball, right?
[15:08.520 --> 15:10.160]  We still hung on keynotes, right?
[15:10.160 --> 15:15.160]  We got up and got in line to get in the keynotes at WWDC or we'd you know
[15:15.160 --> 15:16.840]  Listen to the live feed and stuff like that
[15:16.840 --> 15:20.440]  but it was not that many people compared to today and
[15:20.440 --> 15:28.360]  There was no even all the speculation and there were so many rumor sites that were ton always have been Apple rumor sites and Apple
[15:28.360 --> 15:31.780]  Rumor sites have always been trying to you know, get the goods on upcoming stuff
[15:31.920 --> 15:37.840]  but there was nothing like the market of speculation for for new iPhones and
[15:38.120 --> 15:45.920]  This pressure and I think it's you know, it's clearly financial pressure that there there's money exchanging hands to get these
[15:45.920 --> 15:53.860]  Yeah prototypes and mock-ups and shell casings and screens and home screen buttons and you know
[15:54.440 --> 15:59.120]  Everything has leaked. I'm not saying that we know everything that the phone's gonna do but at least the parts have all leaked
[15:59.120 --> 16:05.440]  I mean there'll be updates somebody will find literally like here's the volume buttons of the new iPhone. Yeah, and
[16:06.360 --> 16:09.640]  You know in the last couple of years the first couple of years when that started happening
[16:09.640 --> 16:14.740]  Everybody was like ask gotta be fake fake fake and ends up. It's like yeah that you know, that was actually right
[16:14.740 --> 16:18.480]  well, the supply chain just I mean, I think the economics of
[16:19.180 --> 16:24.740]  The people working in the supply chain, which is almost entirely in Asia almost entirely in China
[16:25.560 --> 16:29.920]  You know, there are so many people involved and you know culturally
[16:29.920 --> 16:36.840]  It doesn't take that much for somebody who's not being paid very much to get paid a bribe basically to slide
[16:37.060 --> 16:42.240]  One of the 15 samples they've got to somebody else and I and I think that's how business gets done
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.620]  I mean, I really I'm trying not to judge this because I think by their
[16:46.220 --> 16:52.160]  Their cultural standards. It's not that big a deal. That's sort of how business gets done and how competition happens
[16:52.300 --> 16:56.420]  But from Apple's perspective, it's you know antithetical to what they want to do, right?
[16:56.900 --> 17:01.980]  And so they have to do and they can't do it now. They see they can't pre-announce the iPhone
[17:02.060 --> 17:09.100]  Let's just say I've been avoiding the term the iPhone 6 because I don't know what Apple's gonna call it and I you know
[17:09.100 --> 17:14.160]  That they I'd certainly didn't predict that they would stop numbering iPads, right?
[17:14.160 --> 17:18.780]  They said iPad iPad 2 and then they just went back to a new iPad right new iPad
[17:19.900 --> 17:23.380]  And then iPad air and iPad mini so I'm you know
[17:23.380 --> 17:28.100]  They've stuck with this numbering and then a stick and s after the number system for a while
[17:28.100 --> 17:35.360]  But I'm not making any predictions as to sure name, but I'll just say iPhone 6 as shorthand. Yeah shorthand
[17:35.360 --> 17:44.000]  They couldn't they can't announce the iPhone 6 6 months in advance to avoid these supply chain links be leaks because they have to
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.060]  Avoid the Osborne effect exactly even the iPad was a two-month window between announce and ship
[17:50.280 --> 17:54.240]  It's same deal because they weren't cannibalizing some other product when they did it
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.720]  but now that once that product starts once the clock starts ticking then you've got a
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.040]  You got a ship it fast because nobody's buying it between the day you announce and the day you ship it
[18:04.040 --> 18:11.640]  Right because so for example, and I'm sure I've spoken to Apple store employees and people who've worked at Apple stores
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.680]  You know have written to me at during fireball that people come in all the time and they're like, hey
[18:15.680 --> 18:17.680]  I hear there's a new iPhone coming asking sir
[18:17.680 --> 18:22.640]  What do you get and they can honestly say we don't know anything about it. They don't tell us stuff like that
[18:22.640 --> 18:24.760]  We don't know. Here's the iPhones we have today
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.160]  I can tell you all about if they pre-announce it in June and
[18:29.160 --> 18:33.960]  And then somebody comes in in July and says I hear there's gonna be a big iPhone coming out
[18:33.960 --> 18:37.860]  I'd like that sounds interesting to me to be honest. They would have to say yeah, you're right
[18:37.860 --> 18:40.520]  It's you know, we've pre announced if it's coming in
[18:41.880 --> 18:45.880]  September a layaway plan for ya. Well, we'll see you then
[18:47.160 --> 18:48.280]  They can't do that
[18:48.280 --> 18:54.600]  You know so I think and as big as the iPod was and I often when I'm on these podcasts
[18:54.600 --> 18:59.640]  I often start mixing up my iPods and pads but the iPod really the music player as
[18:59.960 --> 19:07.000]  Big as it was and as much as it kind of made Apple the household company outside the Mac community
[19:07.040 --> 19:10.080]  You know that it became a decade ago
[19:11.320 --> 19:11.940]  You know
[19:11.940 --> 19:16.880]  We all used to make jokes when apples first started opening retail stores and you'd be walking through the mall and you'd hear a kid
[19:16.880 --> 19:18.880]  Say mom, I want to go to the iPod store
[19:19.760 --> 19:21.940]  Right. I mean I heard that several times
[19:21.940 --> 19:24.540]  From you know, not from the same kid
[19:26.460 --> 19:31.280]  The iPod was nothing like the iPhone I pop there was no no
[19:32.020 --> 19:36.140]  Market like this for oh my god. Here's the pre-release, you know
[19:37.260 --> 19:39.260]  screen of the new
[19:39.460 --> 19:46.180]  iPod or the here's the here's the new circle rocker. What do we call that? What was that thing called the click wheel?
[19:46.180 --> 19:47.780]  Yeah the click wheel
[19:47.780 --> 19:55.300]  Yeah, you know that people even people who think they follow this stuff don't always understand the scale of the iPhone that like I think
[19:56.340 --> 19:57.500]  Okay, this is gonna be wrong
[19:57.500 --> 20:04.300]  But like I think you're you're run-of-the-mill brand new iPhone model probably sells more than the entire iPod line has ever sold
[20:04.540 --> 20:06.620]  And probably in just a couple of months
[20:06.620 --> 20:10.220]  I mean the scale is is it's not even the same number scale
[20:10.220 --> 20:16.180]  The iPhone is so much more popular a product than even the iPod was in its heyday
[20:16.180 --> 20:22.380]  Yeah, it's just unfathomable and and this pressure is to end, you know, like from that. I think it's largely from
[20:24.220 --> 20:26.100]  It's not from
[20:26.100 --> 20:32.140]  The I think I don't think it's from the rumor sites the people who publish these leaks
[20:32.860 --> 20:33.940]  I
[20:33.940 --> 20:39.940]  Don't think that the money that they get from the page views that come in from the reports
[20:40.060 --> 20:42.940]  comes close to covering the sort of I
[20:42.940 --> 20:49.820]  I know it's like you I don't want to pass judgment but effectively the bribery that's going on and theft in some cases
[20:51.180 --> 20:54.940]  It's the I think it's the casemakers
[20:55.460 --> 21:03.020]  Yeah, because there's so much pressure to get your case to market and Apple isn't going to tell them the measurements of the new phone
[21:03.020 --> 21:05.020]  until it's out and
[21:05.020 --> 21:12.980]  And and yeah, and I get I mean we see there are cases like for the new iPhone that are being I get PR
[21:12.980 --> 21:15.420]  Sometimes from people who say we've got the new iPhone case
[21:15.620 --> 21:20.540]  Weeks before the new iPhone has even been announced because they're confident and and and and in that business
[21:20.540 --> 21:22.900]  I think there's this feeling like if I can make
[21:23.660 --> 21:28.620]  You know five thousand silicon cases based on these dimensions that I think are accurate and I can ship them
[21:28.740 --> 21:31.940]  Into the channel in advance then the day that that phone drops
[21:31.940 --> 21:36.540]  Will be there and if and somebody's gonna be there and it better be us
[21:36.860 --> 21:42.620]  because if we wait to make sure it's right somebody is gonna beat us to the punch and so they're motivated to get it right and
[21:42.820 --> 21:45.100]  I'm sure there are times when they don't get it right
[21:45.100 --> 21:48.860]  but I think they take the gamble because if the if their Intel is right and
[21:49.020 --> 21:53.020]  the the mold that they've made based entirely on parts and
[21:53.780 --> 21:55.780]  hearsay and whatever if it fits
[21:56.100 --> 22:01.100]  Then they can immediately ship it to the channel and sell those and strike while the iron is hot
[22:01.100 --> 22:03.300]  And so they're motivated to do it. Yeah, exactly
[22:04.300 --> 22:05.660]  and
[22:05.660 --> 22:07.660]  You know at the other one I
[22:08.380 --> 22:12.740]  Linked them up last week. I think their name is Feld and Voss
[22:13.460 --> 22:16.620]  The heck is it it's this room. I think they're Russian
[22:18.540 --> 22:20.540]  Felden Volk vol K
[22:21.580 --> 22:26.940]  Go to felled the voc.com fe LD vo lk.com and they don't make cases
[22:26.940 --> 22:31.240]  What they do is they take iPhone 5 s's I guess new ones
[22:31.700 --> 22:38.460]  Anodize the aluminum to new colors. They cut back and put in like actual not like a wood case
[22:38.460 --> 22:42.820]  they actually put like a wood panel in the back or you know like a flower pattern and
[22:42.940 --> 22:49.740]  They take out the volume buttons and replace them with 18 karat gold volume and silence rocker buttons
[22:51.060 --> 22:52.340]  right and
[22:52.340 --> 22:59.660]  Sell them resell them for like nine thousand dollars. Uh, and I heard from people and I'd never heard of them before I mean
[23:00.380 --> 23:01.460]  It just seems crazy
[23:01.460 --> 23:08.940]  But apparently it's a big thing like in Moscow like all the the oligarchs are into these things because they're it's like a culture
[23:09.220 --> 23:14.920]  You know where these crazy billionaire Russians want people to know they have ten thousand dollar iPhones
[23:14.920 --> 23:17.600]  But isn't that better than that crazy?
[23:17.600 --> 23:23.760]  Luxury I can't even remember the name of it, but you know the virtue virtue virtue
[23:23.760 --> 23:28.680]  I mean, this is like a competitor that where it's like it's a real iPhone, but we've actually taken the parts
[23:28.680 --> 23:33.720]  But again, there's that you've got then you really want to know what the shape of the parts are in advance
[23:33.720 --> 23:37.040]  So you can start working on it, right and they had a super high-quality
[23:37.680 --> 23:43.840]  Video like sure they made like a commercial because their clients really want the new iPhone when it comes out, right?
[23:43.840 --> 23:49.120]  Which they've got to have their molds done in advance, even though that's impossible, right?
[23:49.240 --> 23:52.440]  So right this supply chain is a logical place to go
[23:52.440 --> 23:56.080]  I also think perhaps that there are competitors, you know Apple's competitors want to know
[23:56.160 --> 23:56.640]  Yeah
[23:56.640 --> 24:02.520]  They're doing and so they're paying but all this stuff then eventually it just sort of leaks around the edges and you end up with
[24:02.520 --> 24:08.700]  These YouTube videos that are like somebody speaking not in English posted on a YouTube site or even like on a Chinese
[24:08.700 --> 24:16.940]  Social network. I there was an iPhone 6 video on on one of the Chinese social networks that got reposted to YouTube and you know
[24:16.940 --> 24:22.060]  Yeah, it's not Mac rumors paying these people. It's not mark. Mark Gurman isn't paying these people
[24:22.060 --> 24:27.180]  It's a it's it's the it's the people paying like who are much more closely attached to the supply chain
[24:27.180 --> 24:30.620]  And they just they really there's a business advantage to knowing in advance
[24:31.780 --> 24:33.580]  Yeah, definitely
[24:33.580 --> 24:37.380]  And it's crazy. It's it's really kind of nutty
[24:37.380 --> 24:43.620]  Yeah, it does wood iPhones with gold volume rockers. Yeah, let me take a sponsor break and I'll come back
[24:43.620 --> 24:44.980]  But the point I want to come back to you
[24:44.980 --> 24:49.100]  I want to tell you in advance because I often forget by the time I get to the end of a sponsored break though is
[24:50.380 --> 24:55.180]  That most of them don't turn on but then all of a sudden like in the last two days
[24:55.180 --> 24:58.780]  We're starting to see ones. Like you said there's like apparently a fully working
[24:59.740 --> 25:05.620]  4.7 inch one that actually turns on and runs iOS 8 which is crazy, right?
[25:05.620 --> 25:07.300]  I
[25:07.300 --> 25:09.300]  Gonna tell you about our friends at igloo
[25:09.900 --> 25:11.900]  longtime sponsors of the show
[25:12.220 --> 25:15.660]  igloo is the intranet that you'll actually like
[25:16.500 --> 25:22.660]  And they have a super exciting release. That's brand new. It's called unicorn
[25:24.340 --> 25:28.300]  We've talked about their unicorn update on the show before it has a ton of new features
[25:28.420 --> 25:35.040]  But the best is integrated task management that will change how you stay on track with your work
[25:35.040 --> 25:40.640]  It glue tasks can be assigned in different ways depending on the way on the work
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.960]  You're doing one of the coolest ways to use tasks is creating them directly on your content
[25:46.960 --> 25:54.000]  So you're requesting updates on a graphic that somebody on your team is working on or a text correction in a word document
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.680]  You create these tasks right on your content in the igloo interface
[25:58.280 --> 26:03.320]  And then when the designer goes to update the graphic and they go through igloo to get to it the task
[26:03.320 --> 26:06.320]  What you want changed is right there on the same page
[26:06.780 --> 26:12.300]  So when you're viewing content, even if it's a blog if it's an event a forum topic inside your igloo
[26:12.520 --> 26:14.520]  The tasks are all right there
[26:14.520 --> 26:20.600]  So the stuff that you need to be done is right there attached to whatever it is wherever you go in the igloo system
[26:22.560 --> 26:26.440]  Go find out more it's a great stuff all the other stuff about igloo is all still true
[26:27.080 --> 26:31.300]  All sorts of great templates to choose from the fact that it runs
[26:31.300 --> 26:34.740]  It's your private internet that you get to run
[26:35.900 --> 26:40.580]  The fact that you get to start for free for up to ten people and just use it
[26:41.980 --> 26:43.920]  unlimited time
[26:43.920 --> 26:49.900]  Where do you go to find out more? This is it igloo software comm slash the talk show
[26:50.500 --> 26:54.040]  igloo software comm slash the talk show
[26:54.040 --> 27:01.920]  a great great internet and now they're really with this task stuff really making it into a project management system
[27:02.480 --> 27:04.480]  for your small teams
[27:04.600 --> 27:06.740]  And organizations so my thanks to them
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.160]  So in the past we've seen these leaks come out and then they always
[27:12.280 --> 27:18.280]  I think there was one about a week or two ago where it at least turned on to the point where it's showed the connect
[27:18.280 --> 27:19.640]  to iTunes
[27:19.640 --> 27:21.640]  Right, right
[27:21.720 --> 27:23.200]  and
[27:23.200 --> 27:25.440]  It was funny because somebody then took
[27:26.080 --> 27:27.320]  like
[27:27.320 --> 27:34.680]  screenshots of that and like kind of estimated the measurement of the graphic because the graphic had like letterboxing at the top and bottom and
[27:35.800 --> 27:43.200]  A rough estimation is that it was it might be very very close to the the size that I predicted a few weeks ago
[27:44.560 --> 27:46.400]  Which I think makes sense that in other words
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.800]  It's the same pixel per inch as the iPhone 5 and 5s, but just they just cut it to 4.7 inches, right?
[27:53.960 --> 27:56.400]  But now there's ones coming out that are actually fully
[27:57.160 --> 28:04.040]  Operational death stars. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know enough about the production cycle, but I would imagine very late in the game
[28:04.040 --> 28:12.520]  They're producing first off. They're producing like test units and then they're the you know, there was a story about how iPhone shipments were already filling
[28:13.360 --> 28:14.840]  planes
[28:14.840 --> 28:18.760]  From China to North America. So, you know at some point they're making them
[28:18.760 --> 28:19.760]  They haven't announced him yet
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.400]  But they've got to get them here in there and and around the world
[28:22.840 --> 28:28.720]  Assuming that they're gonna drop them in a lot of countries in a couple of weeks. They've got to start shipping them now
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.880]  So once that I mean then the genie is completely out of the bottle and it's got to be a lot easier to
[28:34.160 --> 28:39.320]  Pluck something off the production line and there's probably an earlier wave that are like the the the production
[28:39.320 --> 28:44.640]  Models to see if the process works and if the quality level is high enough and those probably leak
[28:44.680 --> 28:49.640]  so there's probably a life cycle and I never really thought of it this way of life cycle of leaks where you know
[28:49.640 --> 28:55.300]  It starts with all the suppliers and in the end, it's the assembly and then it's the then it starts to be working models
[28:56.240 --> 29:01.760]  Yeah, I think I think they must be making the real ones by now. Yeah, they got they've got to be given the volumes
[29:01.760 --> 29:05.840]  I mean we were talking about how huge the iPhone volume is how much demand there is on day one
[29:05.840 --> 29:10.880]  Right, then they've got to be making and that's why when I saw that story about about how you know
[29:10.880 --> 29:15.440]  There are already lots of Apple shipments coming from China that it's got you know
[29:15.440 --> 29:21.640]  It's completely believable because they've got you know, let's assume that in less than two weeks. They're gonna be on sale
[29:21.760 --> 29:26.680]  They're gonna want to fill the channel with as many as they can possibly make and so yeah, they're making them now
[29:26.680 --> 29:31.960]  We don't even know what it what they are yet, but they're making them and shipping them the story I saw
[29:31.960 --> 29:39.080]  I'm sure you saw the same one is that they've actually at right now they've consumed like a majority share of all shipping
[29:39.240 --> 29:45.760]  Capacity coming out of China, right? Right that Apple Apple is literally like filling the channel and not it's not like its channel
[29:45.760 --> 29:49.760]  It's like the shipping channel from China to the US on planes
[29:50.320 --> 29:56.380]  It's crazy that you know, there's only so many planes. They're not gonna they can't it's not the sort of thing that you can
[29:56.920 --> 30:01.120]  Buy more right because and it wouldn't make sense for the shipping industry
[30:01.120 --> 30:06.480]  to have enough planes to meet this particular demand and then and then the other
[30:07.200 --> 30:12.960]  47 weeks of the year they're sitting a nerd, you know, right an airplane hangers that you know
[30:14.560 --> 30:16.560]  Also, I wonder sometimes about like
[30:16.880 --> 30:21.880]  build the order because sometimes you know you order an Apple's website and you can actually see it get shipped to you that you'd
[30:21.880 --> 30:24.340]  Actually if that if that's gonna be an option
[30:24.600 --> 30:30.400]  You want to ship these early because these are the ones that are going to retail and that at some point if they turn on
[30:30.400 --> 30:33.040]  Pre-orders those would be shipping from China
[30:33.040 --> 30:40.200]  Let's say but you know you now now is the time to fill the channel with the ones that are just in the standard
[30:40.660 --> 30:45.840]  Standard configs or maybe they're all standard configs and they've got every single one possible. But you know, they're
[30:46.540 --> 30:49.600]  What they're doing is they're filling they're filling warehouses
[30:49.600 --> 30:57.160]  They're filling capacity and and we know that Apple usually can sell every single one that they've got and sometimes people are angriest when they can't
[30:57.160 --> 31:01.280]  Get the model they want so it makes sense, but it's mind-boggling again
[31:01.280 --> 31:07.560]  we talked about the scale of iPhones and how it's hard to understand just how huge the iPhone is and I think this fits into
[31:08.200 --> 31:10.200]  wearable expectations and how I think people
[31:11.360 --> 31:16.200]  Expect more than than it could possibly deliver because it's never gonna be I think an iPhone
[31:16.400 --> 31:22.160]  like the iPhone is enormous so enormous that we could take every bit of shipping capacity from China to the US and
[31:22.160 --> 31:27.240]  And Apple is doing it right right and I don't know that there's any product that they could make that would
[31:27.880 --> 31:34.200]  That that there's no other product that I can imagine that that would happen for no, there's no other product category
[31:34.200 --> 31:38.720]  I mean, this is this is this is a there have been some really nice pieces written about this, but it's this idea that
[31:39.840 --> 31:40.440]  You know
[31:40.440 --> 31:46.400]  Somebody actually said you could write the disappointment story like six months ago about the wearable no matter what it is
[31:46.720 --> 31:48.720]  Because people are going to say
[31:48.720 --> 31:53.200]  If the expectation is that it's literally another product category like the iPhone
[31:53.280 --> 31:58.920]  That's not gonna happen because there's no product category like the iPhone the smartphones in general are
[31:59.720 --> 32:04.840]  Enormous this this huge class. It's a it's a shift in how the world uses technology
[32:04.840 --> 32:10.100]  And you know and and with Apple's product line, you can see it. The iPhone is just dwarfs everything else
[32:10.100 --> 32:12.100]  They do and that's not going to change. There's not going to be
[32:12.100 --> 32:18.620]  another category in the next year or two that supplant it or match it even because it's it's just
[32:18.940 --> 32:23.140]  Completely out of scale because there's such demand for for smartphones. Yeah, I
[32:24.020 --> 32:29.500]  And I think it plays into I haven't written it up, but I know maybe but a lot of times
[32:29.500 --> 32:31.580]  I talk about it on the show and and I don't write it but
[32:32.340 --> 32:34.340]  I've been thinking for months now
[32:34.980 --> 32:38.420]  About and I for years. I've been bothered by the whole smartphone
[32:38.420 --> 32:46.020]  Versus phone distinction and that it's so misleading and that you know, Apple's percentage increase in smartphones
[32:49.580 --> 32:50.740]  Versus
[32:50.740 --> 32:55.660]  Like how many more they're selling year-over-year versus their share of the smartphone market, right?
[32:55.660 --> 32:59.540]  And they're very misleading things because the smartphone market is great
[32:59.540 --> 33:05.940]  Even though Apple's iPhone business has been growing steadily every single year the smartphone market
[33:05.940 --> 33:11.300]  Has grown even faster overall and that's simply because all phones are turning into smartphones
[33:12.100 --> 33:18.380]  At a ridiculous rate because it's getting so cheap to make something that would qualify as a smartphone, right?
[33:18.380 --> 33:21.780]  And it's really just this bizarre distinction to me. It's
[33:22.700 --> 33:29.000]  it's like just like a distinction between phones with black and white screens and color screens like
[33:29.380 --> 33:32.460]  like my you know, my first cell phone had a black and white screen and
[33:32.460 --> 33:35.740]  eventually even the cheap $15
[33:36.300 --> 33:42.780]  Candy bar phones had color screens because eventually the color screens got so cheap that you know that they could do that
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.080]  It didn't make sense to talk about somebody's share of the color
[33:46.620 --> 33:54.080]  Phone market even though for a while those phones were more expensive and thus more profitable because you know for a year or two
[33:54.340 --> 34:00.600]  They were like an exotic crazy thing. Like look the crazy little Java game. I play on my phone is in color now, right?
[34:00.600 --> 34:05.520]  What were those members of some of those games like the quicks or whatever? Oh, yeah
[34:05.520 --> 34:09.120]  I had one of those that was unlike a Sony Ericsson where it was terrible
[34:09.120 --> 34:14.920]  I had a I had a bowling game. That was like my go-to bowling game. I had a bowling game on my old Nokia
[34:16.640 --> 34:22.680]  You know in and Horace did you and others who were more analysts, you know, it's more rigorous
[34:24.440 --> 34:29.840]  Statistically than the number the number guys right have explained it, you know in painstaking detail that it's you know
[34:29.840 --> 34:35.020]  It is interesting that that the smartphone market the percentage of all phone sold
[34:35.240 --> 34:39.880]  That our smartphones is growing faster than any one company's share of that market
[34:41.520 --> 34:46.960]  But really like to me it's just we should just start calling them phones and that a phone is a thing
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.640]  That's a computer in your pocket. So my daughter when my daughter went to middle school
[34:51.980 --> 34:57.840]  We got her a phone and it's a and it's not a smartphone and and yet I think by
[34:57.840 --> 35:02.100]  The standards of maybe four or five years before that if not less
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.100]  It would have been considered like a super featured phone because it doesn't I think it doesn't have data
[35:08.240 --> 35:14.160]  But it has a full blackberry style texting keyboard. I mean, it's not just like numbers. It's got a whole
[35:14.960 --> 35:21.580]  You know QWERTY keyboard on it and it's got a color screen and it's got I think you can install
[35:21.580 --> 35:27.740]  I think it might even have some software you can set up or install and and it's not a smartphone as we consider it
[35:27.740 --> 35:30.360]  But it's not that far off and that was three years ago
[35:30.760 --> 35:35.860]  So I would imagine and she's you know, we're gonna end up putting her on our plan and giving her my old iPhone 5
[35:35.860 --> 35:42.520]  I think yeah, but but you know, so when my son starts middle school next year, I mean at what point is that phone?
[35:43.520 --> 35:47.680]  At some point very soon. It is just easier for all concerned
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.640]  If that is you know
[35:49.640 --> 35:54.980]  If the the cheap phone they offer for kids is the cheapest Android phone that they've got
[35:54.980 --> 36:01.380]  Rather than some weird just having to maintain some weird other platform of these dumb phones that is just at some point
[36:01.380 --> 36:03.940]  They'll just give up at least in the in you know
[36:03.940 --> 36:09.500]  The US and and some other of the richer countries and at that point there won't be anything that isn't a smartphone
[36:10.020 --> 36:14.660]  Yeah, and it so there's like two interesting things that fall out of that
[36:14.660 --> 36:21.100]  The first is that if you go back to 2007 and you think about the iPhone and the name iPhone that it
[36:21.100 --> 36:26.540]  under sold the device vastly because it really wasn't a phone it was a
[36:27.460 --> 36:34.660]  Computer an internet connected computer in your pants. It was amazing and it happened to also work on these
[36:35.060 --> 36:40.980]  Standard cell phone network and make in place at phone calls and let you you know
[36:40.980 --> 36:45.980]  For example, one of the key features of that first one huge part of the demo was visual voicemail
[36:45.980 --> 36:53.900]  Because it and and what did that do it let you deal with your voicemail the way modern graphical computers deal with messages
[36:53.940 --> 36:55.940]  Right, right
[36:56.260 --> 36:59.820]  And so at first calling it a phone or the phone or the iPhone
[37:00.080 --> 37:03.280]  Was really selling it short because it wasn't what we thought of as a phone
[37:03.740 --> 37:09.340]  It was it really truly was what we think of what we then thought of as a personal computer
[37:09.340 --> 37:16.520]  Whereas now lo these seven years later when we say phone we mean we don't mean a device
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  that's just for phone calls we mean a
[37:19.820 --> 37:24.420]  Computer right, right if you say I like if somebody says you get you know
[37:24.420 --> 37:31.360]  You arrive at a restaurant you've a group of friends and you you took an uber and you get out and somebody says I left
[37:31.360 --> 37:34.540]  My phone in the car, you know what they left in the car. They didn't leave a cell phone
[37:34.540 --> 37:39.460]  They left like an iPhone or some an Android it whatever it was. It has apps and stuff, you know
[37:39.460 --> 37:40.260]  Yep
[37:40.260 --> 37:46.500]  Nobody when they say I left my phone in the car means they left a device that only makes phone calls and text messages
[37:46.500 --> 37:48.500]  Well and as landlines die
[37:48.580 --> 37:52.980]  the whole concept of anything else a phone could be just disappears and and and
[37:53.100 --> 37:56.500]  Phone is not perhaps the best term to use for these devices
[37:56.620 --> 37:59.960]  But I kind of feel like it's the one that it's you know
[37:59.960 --> 38:02.980]  One of those cases where the word evolves to mean something completely different
[38:02.980 --> 38:08.700]  but because it's supplanting the thing that it it it took its name from then that's what we'll call it and at some point people are
[38:08.700 --> 38:11.740]  Gonna be like this is weird. Why do we call it a phone and somebody's gonna say well, actually
[38:12.500 --> 38:17.320]  Let me tell you the story of the 20th century and the phone and that's where it came from people be like wow
[38:17.320 --> 38:20.980]  I don't even you know, why why would you do that? And the answer is well
[38:21.460 --> 38:22.500]  it was a
[38:22.500 --> 38:27.720]  series of small steps and at no point did somebody say this isn't a phone anymore because we had to explain what it was to
[38:27.720 --> 38:34.340]  people who who their entire frame of reference was the concept of a phone because I mean talking on the phone is like one of
[38:34.340 --> 38:40.380]  The least interesting things that I do on my iPhone at least common. It's the least pleasant. It's the only thing
[38:40.380 --> 38:42.860]  It's I took it out of the dock. I finally got shamed
[38:42.860 --> 38:46.580]  I think maybe even by by you it was a conversation on the on Twitter
[38:46.580 --> 38:50.820]  I think and I realized why is the phone app even in my dock on my iPhone?
[38:50.820 --> 38:56.500]  I never have it. I have it out of my dock. I took it out. My dock is messages Vesper
[38:56.500 --> 38:58.420]  There's an ad
[38:58.420 --> 39:02.460]  Safari and tweet pot. That's honest though. Vesper really is in my in my dog
[39:02.460 --> 39:07.260]  I have male Safari Twitter ethic and overcast in my dog very close
[39:07.700 --> 39:09.780]  Vesper's desperate down there, but it's not in the dog
[39:09.780 --> 39:14.260]  But but yeah, I yanked the phone out because because frankly if somebody calls me
[39:14.660 --> 39:16.660]  I don't need to launch the app and
[39:17.220 --> 39:21.560]  If I call somebody I know where I know where it is and I call people so seldomly but yeah
[39:21.560 --> 39:26.780]  So I feel like the name is going to be phone now, right? I doubt it will ever change. We'll just call them phones
[39:26.980 --> 39:33.060]  Right, but phone doesn't mean what it meant. It's the way language evolves. It evolves in ways that the
[39:35.140 --> 39:41.140]  Well computer is a terrible word too. Yeah, I think about it. Yeah true true very true
[39:41.780 --> 39:45.820]  What's the the the great divide in like dictionaries is?
[39:46.580 --> 39:48.180]  prescriptivism versus
[39:48.180 --> 39:50.180]  Descriptive is right. Whereas should a dictionary
[39:50.180 --> 39:58.480]  Prescribe here is how you should use all of the words. Yeah, because here is what they mean or should it describe?
[39:59.380 --> 40:05.380]  Here is what people mean when they use these words and in some cases, you know, maybe you know
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.800]  With italics say this is an in this is informal, you know, or this is slang
[40:11.900 --> 40:17.800]  But you're just describing the use of the words and sometimes those informal uses of the words
[40:17.800 --> 40:22.920]  Are used so much that they become a new sense of the word and I think that's where we are with phone
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.920]  We're maybe for the first couple of years
[40:25.360 --> 40:27.360]  Calling the iPhone a phone
[40:27.520 --> 40:28.880]  would
[40:28.880 --> 40:34.480]  In dictionary terms be informal, you know and people who knew what you were talking about would get it
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.500]  But I think we're at the point now where it's like time to add a new number
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.280]  To what does phone mean and you know a new integer and like meaning number four, right?
[40:44.280 --> 40:50.760]  a pocket computer that is connected to cellular networks and Wi-Fi and can
[40:51.720 --> 40:59.480]  Install apps right? Cuz it's it's it feels like the ship has sailed. We're not gonna suddenly say, okay, everybody stop on January 1st
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.360]  We're gonna stop calling them phones and we're gonna call them. I know
[41:03.280 --> 41:04.840]  Communicators, right?
[41:04.840 --> 41:11.840]  Wait, and the prescriptivists will fight it tooth and nail all the way down. Sure, but it doesn't matter. That's the language is like water
[41:11.840 --> 41:14.760]  It's like trying to stop running water with your hands. It's going to happen
[41:14.760 --> 41:15.320]  anyway
[41:15.320 --> 41:19.680]  but the point of all the point of this the whole reason this inspired it is your point about how big the
[41:20.320 --> 41:25.800]  iPhone is in the phone market is is that the phone is the end thinking of it as a phone not thinking of as a
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.080]  Smartphone but just going to phone meaning a cell phone
[41:29.280 --> 41:35.880]  Mm-hmm is the only thing I can think of on the planet where almost everybody who could have one
[41:36.960 --> 41:39.040]  Does or will yeah have one?
[41:39.040 --> 41:45.600]  Yes, every you could argue that it will be the first piece of high technology
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.000]  That will be in the possession of I don't know
[41:51.360 --> 41:56.240]  90% of the human beings on earth because you look at the way this technology is is
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.280]  Spreading in parts of the world that are not traditionally high-tech societies places that are poorer
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.280]  like Africa as a really great example where we've already seen like
[42:07.280 --> 42:13.960]  Wireless technology leap over wired technology because you don't need the infrastructure that I used to need
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.400]  And and and the internet at some point will be their experience with the internet will be in a phone screen
[42:20.680 --> 42:22.080]  Not on a computer
[42:22.080 --> 42:26.880]  But in a phone screen because that that is a device that is going to be cheap enough to reach them
[42:26.960 --> 42:33.800]  Gonna be able to attach via the wireless network that that is going to be available and and as a result will be more
[42:34.160 --> 42:35.240]  transformative
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.280]  as a whole I mean we can think about how the Internet's changed all of our lives and computers and all of that but for
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.360]  like the average human being on
[42:43.160 --> 42:49.240]  Planet Earth the phone is gonna be the thing that is transformative because it's gonna reach way more people
[42:49.600 --> 42:53.320]  Yeah, and I think it's really in or I think it was on pace for that
[42:54.200 --> 42:56.040]  before
[42:56.040 --> 42:58.040]  2007 but when it was
[42:58.320 --> 43:00.680]  Just voice and texting right then it was a phone
[43:00.680 --> 43:06.680]  I'm not a phone phone and I think it was already on pace to you know, if there's seven billion people on the planet and
[43:07.320 --> 43:09.400]  I don't know. I might be
[43:10.480 --> 43:12.480]  missing the mark on how many people are
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.800]  You know very elderly or babies right or very very very truly truly poor
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.840]  But let's say five billion of them could have a cell phone
[43:25.840 --> 43:30.240]  It's getting very close to the point where that's true, you know where there's you know
[43:30.520 --> 43:36.200]  Billions of cell phones in use and everybody's gonna have one and everybody because of the nature of the thing that you're banging it around
[43:36.200 --> 43:41.520]  In your pocket, even if you take care of it, you know every couple years you're gonna get a new one, right?
[43:41.520 --> 43:43.840]  it's not going to be like your
[43:45.480 --> 43:51.640]  You know like TV sets where people buy TV sets and use them for 15 20 years right cell phones aren't like that maybe
[43:51.640 --> 43:55.600]  Eventually, but it's their weights. Well, not now, right? Not right now
[43:56.240 --> 44:01.480]  Not in the year, you know the world we live in where every year there's a new iPhone, you know
[44:01.480 --> 44:06.560]  So the size of this market is I I truly wonder if it even really occurred to Apple
[44:07.120 --> 44:13.440]  You know in 2005 2006 and a run-up to the iPhone just how big the potential is there I?
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.320]  Don't know. I mean on one level
[44:16.320 --> 44:21.360]  I think they had the vision of how this was a big deal and this was gonna make a difference
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.480]  But it you'd have to really be
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.400]  You'd have to buy in all the way to really believe like this is the future and and and I don't know
[44:29.400 --> 44:32.440]  I kind of feel like that's that was so far away at that point that they couldn't really
[44:32.660 --> 44:36.480]  You know, you could you could maybe dream it but you couldn't really see it and now you can see it
[44:36.480 --> 44:38.480]  Yeah back then it was more like
[44:38.480 --> 44:43.160]  Imagine what would happen if we could pack all this stuff in there and then the world saw that and said oh well
[44:43.160 --> 44:46.080]  This is it and now every device in this class
[44:46.080 --> 44:52.480]  Follows their lead and now the world is is changing because that was a moment where like you said, you know
[44:52.480 --> 44:55.200]  Sure, we could have said five billion people are gonna have phones
[44:55.200 --> 45:01.040]  But what it would have meant was they can call somebody and now it's they can be on the internet with that device
[45:01.040 --> 45:03.720]  I still think it's interesting and I remember this this
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.680]  Clearly is that and in that initial keynote Steve Jobs?
[45:07.800 --> 45:12.760]  He gave goals for what they wanted and he said we would like, you know with by a year from now
[45:12.760 --> 45:18.000]  We would like to have 1% of the phone market right and it was and that's what he said
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.040]  He didn't say 1% of the smartphone market
[45:20.040 --> 45:22.800]  He said 1% of the cell phone market
[45:22.800 --> 45:30.080]  And that's one area where I truly think that Apple and Steve Jobs clearly got it because what was then called us
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.520]  Quote-unquote smartphone was not the Apple had no interest in that whatsoever
[45:34.520 --> 45:40.880]  They saw that as it was just as much garbage as the plain old non smartphones that came before it
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.460]  You know, it wasn't worth thinking about it was worth thinking about just playing phones
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.900]  Because a phone is something everybody will have and everybody only has one
[45:50.500 --> 45:53.920]  Well, and so the real question is with with the wearable stuff
[45:55.180 --> 45:57.180]  Is that what they're thinking?
[45:57.380 --> 46:03.620]  Which I think I think is the right thing to think which is not how do we get how do we address the smartwatch market?
[46:03.620 --> 46:12.340]  right, but thinking can can you think of something bigger that is more addressable than then because you know
[46:12.340 --> 46:18.300]  I I have a pebble and I actually wear it most days and I can bounce that I have seen you wearing your pebble
[46:18.300 --> 46:19.660]  Yeah, and I think it's fine
[46:19.660 --> 46:25.220]  I like the notifications on my wrist because it means I can ignore a lot of notifications that I would otherwise take out my phone
[46:25.580 --> 46:29.860]  But you know, it feels like I used to have a palm trio, right? I think you might have had one too
[46:29.860 --> 46:33.580]  It feels like that. It feels like a thing. That's cool and interesting
[46:33.580 --> 46:37.820]  But it's a kind of a hack and in hindsight is going to be seen as the thing that happened before
[46:38.460 --> 46:41.380]  the real thing I didn't have a trio I had the
[46:42.340 --> 46:48.480]  Handspring by the visor. All right, so I was before it even had like internet, right, but I was real into it
[46:48.480 --> 46:50.380]  I did I gave it like home OS. Yeah
[46:50.380 --> 46:56.760]  Yeah, I gave it like a full year where I was taking all my notes on it and sinking my stuff over. I forget how we
[46:56.760 --> 47:04.160]  See cereal. Yeah, I think it was like a cereal cable. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean that's the the pebble feels like that to me
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.600]  It feels like that reminds me of my trio where it's like it's cool at the time
[47:07.640 --> 47:13.760]  but I'm under no illusion that this is the end product of this category because
[47:13.960 --> 47:15.960]  It's not it's an early adopter
[47:16.080 --> 47:23.240]  Let's experiment and it's exactly the kind of product that Apple would never make because it's not really a product for regular people
[47:23.240 --> 47:28.640]  It's a product for people like me who want to you know, try it out and think about what this might mean
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.160]  But and like that there's it's cool new tech, but it's not it's just not good enough
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.760]  And the trio was kind of like that. It wasn't really good enough. It was a weird
[47:37.760 --> 47:43.160]  It was a PDA attached to a cell phone and yeah, it was not good enough, you know, but it was ahead of its time
[47:43.160 --> 47:47.320]  It was definitely it was right was the cutting edge. It was just to happen first
[47:47.320 --> 47:52.840]  It right, you know, somebody had to think of it first before you could get there the you know, exactly
[47:55.560 --> 47:56.680]  Well, let's take a break
[47:56.680 --> 48:01.660]  Let me take a break and we'll come back to that question of how big and where I think the wearable thing is going
[48:02.240 --> 48:07.000]  But let me tell you about our second sponsor and it's our good friends at fracture
[48:07.000 --> 48:16.840]  F R a CT you are a fracture. I feel like with my boys. Like I'm not enunciating enunciating that clearly
[48:17.240 --> 48:23.920]  Here's what fracture does their response are a while back maybe you remember them you send them your picture they print it
[48:24.680 --> 48:26.680]  super high quality on
[48:26.800 --> 48:28.200]  glass and
[48:28.200 --> 48:30.200]  Then they ship that rack to you
[48:30.200 --> 48:37.120]  It's not a picture framed in glass. It is a piece of glass with the picture printed right on it
[48:37.440 --> 48:40.040]  best way I can describe it is that difference between
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.240]  Like the old iPhones when it looked like a touch, you know
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.080]  there was this piece of glass over the screen and then when the iPhone 4 came out and it looked like the pixels were actually
[48:50.080 --> 48:55.120]  On the screen and that they you know, it wasn't two pieces laminated together. It was like one piece
[48:55.120 --> 49:01.760]  That's what they do at fracture. They actually print the photo on the glass and it's a really cool effect
[49:01.760 --> 49:06.240]  It looks so much better than a picture underneath glass. Very very cool
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.120]  They have all sorts of sizes available
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.080]  Everything from little small things for your desk to big things that you can put on the wall
[49:14.640 --> 49:16.880]  they ship them to you in a really cool thing and
[49:17.920 --> 49:22.800]  You don't even need to frame the picture itself can be hung right on the wall and it just looks cool
[49:22.800 --> 49:28.760]  It's just this piece of glass. That is a photo that you can just hang on a wall and they look great without a frame
[49:28.760 --> 49:33.160]  You don't need to put a frame around them really great the whole thing what you buy what they ship to you
[49:33.160 --> 49:36.360]  You just open the box. You can put it right in the wall and it looks great
[49:36.880 --> 49:42.160]  Great idea for gifts. I am totally gonna steal this idea from Marco Arment
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.840]  Who won last week's ATP?
[49:45.000 --> 49:50.040]  mentioned that every time he makes a new app before he sells it to somebody else he
[49:50.040 --> 49:56.840]  Celebrates by getting the apps icon on a five by five fracture and then he hangs them up on his wall
[49:57.680 --> 49:59.680]  So anybody out there who's like a developer?
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.360]  Great idea and it looks great. I have seen them on Marco's wall. They look beautiful
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.240]  So you don't couldn't you know, that's sort of an edge case, but it looks great. Even if it's not a photo
[50:11.640 --> 50:16.520]  It's just really really great. We have a bunch of them here in the house and there's some of my favorite pictures
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.960]  Where do you go to find out more easy? Their website is fracture me calm
[50:23.720 --> 50:27.920]  Fracture me calm and if you use this code the talk show
[50:28.480 --> 50:35.240]  You save 5% off any order just boom. You just save money the talk show go to fracture me
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.160]  Send a couple pictures get a couple back see what I mean. And then like by Christmas you'll be ordering everybody in your family
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.080]  Fracture pictures. It's a great service
[50:47.280 --> 50:51.640]  Back to the show. So how big is the wearable market? I don't know
[50:51.640 --> 50:58.160]  I I honestly don't because here's what I think I think I think if anything if it's big it might be
[50:58.840 --> 51:00.840]  sort of the opposite of
[51:00.920 --> 51:07.640]  The iPhone where the iPhone has been this like here's one new iPhone a year
[51:07.640 --> 51:14.560]  Here's the iPhone for the next year. If the wearable thing is big. I think it could be like
[51:15.200 --> 51:18.080]  There's 15 different wearables from Apple to choose from
[51:20.120 --> 51:23.000]  You know and maybe collectively they're pretty big and
[51:23.440 --> 51:29.240]  Have a range in prices, but that it might you know, so for example just you know, just think about the old iPods
[51:29.240 --> 51:31.640]  You know when the iPods were big and there were you know?
[51:31.640 --> 51:37.200]  The four or five of them right there was you know, a little nano sized thing a little clip-on thing
[51:37.200 --> 51:38.540]  That didn't even have a screen
[51:38.540 --> 51:42.820]  There was like the main regular one that was sort of mid-sized and then there was the big one
[51:42.920 --> 51:47.300]  The you know, and I stay still have that lineup. We just don't get excited about them anymore, right?
[51:47.640 --> 51:50.140]  But it could be that sort of thing and you know
[51:50.360 --> 51:54.840]  One or two of them or watches and one or two of them or something else's and who knows?
[51:55.680 --> 51:57.520]  yeah, I I
[51:57.520 --> 52:02.400]  Mean, I don't really know what to think about this market either other than you know the caution that it's not gonna be the size
[52:02.400 --> 52:08.480]  of the phone market because nothing is and the feeling like it's gonna be an accessory like it feels to me like this is a
[52:08.480 --> 52:11.200]  Device, you know if there is something on your wrist
[52:11.200 --> 52:15.980]  It's a device that's meant to work with the iPhone and and that that actually makes it logically part of the iPhone event
[52:16.080 --> 52:19.120]  To talk about it that the iPhone is the center the you know
[52:19.120 --> 52:22.120]  It's a little bit like the old digital hub story that Steve Jobs told back in
[52:22.120 --> 52:28.720]  2000 except the center the hub now is the iPhone the iPhones with you all the time. It's got the the high-speed connection
[52:28.720 --> 52:36.720]  And then you can have something like this whether it's one sensor that's on your wrist or whether it's a constellation of different things
[52:37.160 --> 52:39.860]  On your body and in your house and wherever else
[52:40.360 --> 52:46.480]  and they all you know talk to your iPhone and your iPhone collects the data and relays things to the internet and all of that but
[52:47.280 --> 52:49.280]  You know, it doesn't feel like
[52:49.280 --> 52:54.360]  You know again, it feels like a it's about accessories. It's about adding on
[52:55.400 --> 52:57.400]  not about a
[52:57.440 --> 53:02.320]  Category that is breaking. I don't know entirely new ground, you know
[53:02.640 --> 53:07.720]  it's hard to it's hard to even think about this because it's so intertwined its technology and its fashion and
[53:10.840 --> 53:14.380]  And I do think it's gonna rely on the iPhone to some degree
[53:14.380 --> 53:17.200]  So this is the question of like how many of these are going to be sold?
[53:17.200 --> 53:19.200]  how many
[53:19.320 --> 53:20.680]  How often is a person?
[53:20.680 --> 53:23.280]  Expected to buy one of these if you buy something and put it on your wrist
[53:23.280 --> 53:27.520]  Are you expecting to have it there for a year two years five years? I don't know
[53:28.320 --> 53:30.000]  Yeah, and you know, it's funny
[53:30.000 --> 53:36.120]  I've in the same way that I've avoided using the phrase iPhone 6 or try I've tried to you know
[53:36.120 --> 53:40.360]  Wherever practical I've avoided I've certainly avoid I think I've never used the word I watch
[53:40.600 --> 53:43.960]  Yeah, that's and I've tried to avoid calling it a watch
[53:43.960 --> 53:48.880]  I've been calling it a wearable right and I knew you know, I know for a fact that they're working on
[53:49.040 --> 53:51.280]  You know some sort of wearable stuff for a while
[53:51.440 --> 53:55.860]  But I didn't know any more than that and I didn't want to assume watch and I heard some people say
[53:55.960 --> 54:02.640]  It's a watch and I thought alright, that's a possibility and obviously there's a lot of companies in the last 12 months that have been
[54:03.480 --> 54:05.960]  active making you know smart watches
[54:07.920 --> 54:11.600]  But all that said it seems like in the run-up to this event
[54:11.600 --> 54:16.880]  There's suddenly a lot more smoke. Mm-hmm, you know in terms of you know, my by
[54:17.520 --> 54:21.360]  Triangulating these rumors. I'd I often just subscribe to you if there's enough smoke there
[54:21.360 --> 54:24.820]  There's got to be some sort of fire and there's an awful lot of smoke
[54:25.480 --> 54:30.080]  specifically that it's a watch or two watches I guess is actually we're you know, I think
[54:31.120 --> 54:34.900]  Nick Bilton, I think from the New York Times that said that or was it Brian Chen?
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.540]  Yeah, it looks like we're at the point now where it's it's um and Jessica lesson
[54:39.540 --> 54:44.820]  It's leaks and counter leaks and and that some of this is is about Apple this late in the game
[54:44.820 --> 54:47.140]  It's also about Apple trying to set expectations
[54:47.140 --> 54:52.340]  So I think I think definitely there's so much smoke here that there's no way there isn't isn't fire of some kind
[54:53.720 --> 54:58.960]  But if it really is a watch and I think that's still even right now, you know
[54:58.960 --> 55:03.600]  And like I said, there's an awful lot of people who are listening to this podcast prop possibly after the event. So
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.720]  Enjoy as you and I are speaking
[55:06.720 --> 55:13.440]  On Sunday night. Yeah, we don't know. I still think if it's a watch boy
[55:13.440 --> 55:15.440]  The word watch has so many
[55:16.360 --> 55:20.280]  Expectations like people buy a watch they do not expect to replace a watch every two years
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.360]  I mean people buy a watch and they expect that thing to last and if it's expensive
[55:26.120 --> 55:29.640]  They really expect it to last, you know, and there was a leak
[55:29.640 --> 55:31.440]  I forget who had it that you know
[55:31.440 --> 55:35.880]  Somebody said that Apple's considering a $400 price point and that makes me laugh
[55:35.880 --> 55:43.680]  In one way and it makes me think hmm in another because if it's true that it's 400 or they're thinking about 400
[55:43.680 --> 55:49.500]  Then I think it's not an accessory, right? I think 400 bucks you're in the range of something
[55:49.500 --> 55:51.500]  That's sort of got to stand on its own. I
[55:52.640 --> 55:54.560]  Don't know I don't know
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.540]  Depends on what accessory means. I mean it may just be that to get on the internet and things like that
[55:58.540 --> 56:02.800]  It really needs to talk to a phone or a Wi-Fi connection or something and not be its own little cell phone
[56:02.800 --> 56:07.440]  But but yeah, it's more than it's more than an impulse buy at 400
[56:07.440 --> 56:12.640]  You really have high expectations of what that device is going to do. The part that made me laugh though was the
[56:14.160 --> 56:19.760]  2010 Wall Street Journal story about Apple's tablet efforts that said that they're considering a
[56:20.840 --> 56:27.560]  $999 iPad that's right. That's where my thought went to which is it almost feels like an attempt to set the bar high
[56:27.560 --> 56:30.480]  So when the real price is revealed everybody is relieved
[56:30.480 --> 56:38.960]  Oh, I remember at the iPod there. I put there. I did it the iPad intro original iPad intro and
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.160]  They're like, you know the whole spiel, you know
[56:42.160 --> 56:46.680]  It's got a fit between this and this there has to be a reason for it has to be better than anything that this and it
[56:46.680 --> 56:50.120]  All made sense and it they showed it and it was like it. Wow, that looks great
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.040]  You know, I cannot wait to see this. I'm this looks super exciting
[56:54.080 --> 56:57.940]  This looks really cool and the whole time I was thinking it's got to be
[56:57.940 --> 57:04.940]  $999 look at it. It's like a Mac, you know, and it's super thin and I know that making it that thin is expensive, right?
[57:04.940 --> 57:08.480]  It's like this thing is cooler than any Mac book
[57:08.480 --> 57:13.140]  It may not be faster than it because I know it's running arm, but it's cooler than any Mac book
[57:13.140 --> 57:20.280]  It's got to be 999 and then when they you know, the starting price was 499. I remember that that room it was
[57:21.620 --> 57:27.380]  It was easily the biggest moment the most exciting moment of that event had nothing to do with the actual iPad
[57:27.380 --> 57:31.100]  Even though there was lots that was exciting about it and lots of it
[57:31.100 --> 57:36.620]  Most of it had had been completely secret. But when when they dropped that price it was
[57:37.460 --> 57:41.980]  Jaw-dry, I mean people gasped right and not just because the device was cool
[57:41.980 --> 57:49.260]  But because that 999 number had come out and the Wall Street Journal ran it. Everybody was doing those, you know beard scratching
[57:49.540 --> 57:54.620]  Yeah, you know. Well, what does it mean? It will people buy it for 999 and that was yeah
[57:54.620 --> 57:59.140]  It was all framed around that price and and that's exactly where my mind went with with
[57:59.620 --> 58:02.740]  this wearable rumor is like is that a real price or is that the
[58:03.540 --> 58:08.260]  The the price that gets out there so that when they announce that it's really 300
[58:08.500 --> 58:13.180]  Instead of saying Wow 300 is a little pricey you say oh my god. I can't believe it's only 300
[58:13.180 --> 58:19.060]  I don't know whether that's true or not, but it is that feel to it, right? Right or even you know, 199
[58:19.060 --> 58:23.200]  you know and then all of a sudden it's like wow people are gonna get in line for it because you know,
[58:23.200 --> 58:25.000]  a
[58:25.000 --> 58:30.880]  Electronics aside and the gadgetry and the all the health sensors and stuff presumably that the thing has
[58:31.600 --> 58:34.720]  But Fitbit's don't cost that much, you know, right? I mean there's none
[58:35.920 --> 58:39.780]  You you can't buy like a Rolex for $199
[58:39.780 --> 58:46.680]  But you can buy what most people would consider a pretty nice watch for a hundred ninety nine. Yes, you know, it's it's again
[58:46.680 --> 58:50.800]  It's not jewelry. It's not true luxury. It's mass-market luxury
[58:50.800 --> 58:53.840]  It's like I have a spot. I actually have a
[58:54.680 --> 58:57.640]  a watch in my Amazon shopping cart and
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.200]  Because I was thinking of replacing my old watch and it looks pretty nice and it's 30 bucks
[59:02.200 --> 59:06.240]  and then my wife actually instead bought me a watch for our anniversary and
[59:06.800 --> 59:13.480]  At like Macy's or something and it's a very nice watch but it's it's probably a hundred and fifty dollar watch
[59:13.480 --> 59:16.160]  It's not right. Yeah, you know you can go to yeah
[59:16.160 --> 59:21.600]  You can go to a store like Macy's and you know looked at me so for you know at those prices Apple could make you
[59:21.600 --> 59:22.600]  know a
[59:22.600 --> 59:24.600]  profitable device
[59:25.960 --> 59:27.960]  But it's a lot more than most people
[59:28.720 --> 59:33.860]  Have spend on watches, you know, so it's you know, so somebody who does collect, you know
[59:34.200 --> 59:41.200]  Rolex or Amiga or whatever watches might think well $1.99. That's not really a luxury watch but most people would think wow
[59:41.200 --> 59:44.540]  This is gonna be the most expensive watch I've ever bought but I can't wait to have it
[59:44.540 --> 59:46.540]  Mm-hmm, I
[59:46.580 --> 59:48.980]  Could totally see it that way. I don't you know, I
[59:49.700 --> 59:51.020]  Don't know
[59:51.020 --> 59:54.580]  It's a it's a strange and the fact that Apple has hired all of these
[59:55.820 --> 59:59.300]  people who come from like luxury brands
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.940]  It makes you wonder on one level and yet sometimes I think we take that too
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:08.340]  literally is like, you know, because on a grand scale Apple is a luxury brand and
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.540]  that having them having them at Apple doesn't necessarily mean that they're making a
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:16.100]  You know a thousand dollar gold
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.800]  Smartwatch it doesn't follow that that is the case, but I it does make me wonder, you know
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:29.820]  Especially since this is replaceable technology. This is not stuff that's gonna be valid in seven years or five years maybe or four years even
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:37.700]  What this product is and because because if it's a luxury product and it's beautiful, what's its shelf life?
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:43.780]  How long is a reasonable amount of time? Like I have my dad's Rolex that he bought in
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:49.620]  Switzerland in the 60s in the early 60s and it you know, I've had it like cleaned and stuff
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.180]  But he gave it to me a few years before he died and it's beautiful and you know
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.820]  It's from 50 plus years ago and works fine
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:03.460]  These things are not gonna be like that even if they're great and made with wonderful
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:09.020]  Materials and that the leather and the metal and all of that is good. The electronic stuff is gonna be surpassed in a year
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:14.220]  Yeah, and it won't be interesting like you you were not gonna be able to pass that down to your son
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.900]  No and have it be interesting 50 years from now
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:21.380]  No, it might be an interesting like history item, but it's not gonna be something you would wear
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:25.520]  For a night out, right and think about this now now
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:33.360]  Circle back to the discussion. We just had about how the word phone has taken a new meaning and it doesn't mean you know
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:39.080]  To like what our parents mean my my dad, you know thinks the phone is a thing that's connected to the wall
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.780]  Yeah, right how we met a little curly cord, right? And that's what he uses to talk to me about baseball
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.320]  The same exact thing could happen to the word watch
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:57.140]  Right. We're right now today a watch means this thing like you're talking about like wherever you talk about a nice watch
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.500]  You're talking about a thing that your dad could have bought in
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.980]  1962 and which is like
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:10.980]  Still in perfect working order and serviceable and has enormous emotional
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:17.500]  Resonance with you because you know, he's not with us anymore, you know, and there's four years. Yeah, right
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.820]  So now it's it's you know, it's a priceless artifact, right?
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.780]  The
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:32.060]  watch could take on a totally new meaning that evolves past that where even it and it could happen quickly because look I happen how
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:38.620]  Quickly it's happened with the word phone. We're even 10 15 years from now watch doesn't mean that anymore watch means
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:43.780]  computer on your on your wrist right computer on your wrist with an expectation that it's
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.660]  collecting data about your health and it's
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:52.880]  Telling you when something important is happening. And yeah, it could it could do that
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.400]  I think I think that's what makes this story. So fascinating is because again
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.400]  We're looking at something where we've seen some companies try this and they've done some interesting things. They're definitely
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.040]  interesting
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.680]  The pieces are all there for something interesting
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:13.400]  But there's one the question of how you mix them together and two is that thing then something that people?
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.640]  actually want because I
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.980]  Talked to a lot of people who say they don't wear a watch where they stopped or they never wore a watch
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:27.360]  and so what what do you have if that is Apple trying to motivate people to strap something on their wrist and and what's the
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.240]  Value you get out of doing that
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:36.680]  well, it's I see that's very to me that's a super interesting question because is it better for you to be a watch where
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.280]  Already and an Apple just has to convince you to
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.720]  Get their watch and replace yours with theirs or is it better if you're not and you've got an open wrist, right?
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960]  Watch doesn't mean anything to you, right?
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.560]  Right, you've got an open wrist. They don't even have to convince you that you're
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:02.240]  That the Apple watch is better than your fossil watch that you've been wearing for a while or the Rolex that you're wearing
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240]  You know that costs ten times more
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:10.280]  if you have an open wrist, maybe it's a wide open thing because
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.320]  It's solving an entirely different problem
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.440]  It it's you know, your your fossil watch or your Movado or your you know
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:26.880]  Omega is primarily just telling you the time and maybe that's not even what the watch does like that's one of the things I wonder
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:33.320]  Like all these other smart watches start with the idea that by default you just look at the screen or like with the pebble
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.400]  You have to turn it on right pebble is always on right?
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.720]  It is always on but you have to do something to make it light up if it's if right if it's dark, right?
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:45.160]  Right, but primarily the first thing it's doing is telling you the time. Yep
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:53.040]  And what if that wasn't the baseline what no, right what if that's not the baseline what if it's not like that
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:05:00.120]  You know and there's rumors that it has that this Apple thing has a color screen and that it's going to run apps and that's probably
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.120]  Running, you know iOS
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.440]  And there's no way there's no way Apple's gonna do a black and white. No way. It's impossible
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.680]  So if it has a display, it must be a color display and all these other ones like the the moto
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:21.400]  360, you know came out this week or shipped this week finally, right and the other Android wear phones have come out and
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.480]  their default watch faces are
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.720]  skeuomorphic
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.380]  Representations of what we traditionally think of as fine watches right right and at least in pictures they look like
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:39.940]  Wow, that does look like a real watch. That's kind of interesting or that looks nice. People say they look nice to me
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.580]  They don't look nice
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:46.100]  But and you know, and I think I've still not seen an Android wear one in person
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.700]  But I'm pretty sure if I saw it in person
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:53.180]  I would think it looks like a nice watch in a way that like the iPhone calculator
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:57.920]  Used to look like a nice Braun calculator. It didn't look like a nice Braun calculator
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.300]  It was you know, just a piece of glass and I had like the buttons on it. It might have been a cool
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.660]  It was a cool. I thought it was a cool way to make a calculator app for the iPhone
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:12.300]  But it never would have interested me and fascinated me. Like if somebody said hey, by the way, I've got this
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:17.700]  1972 Braun calculator that was my dad's and that I would think look at that
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:22.580]  It's the uncanny valley where you're trying you're trying to be a thing to simulate a thing
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:29.580]  Right so hard that it ends up being weird the pebbles like this to the pebble faces that I use are not at all
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:36.100]  Attempting to look like real watches. There's like the one with the words and there's the one with like a little animated face on it
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:44.020]  But like a like a cartoon character face, but they're not like the the they're actual like this looks like a real watch face
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.180]  Those are awful
[01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.900]  I can't even look at them because they hurt my eyes because they are
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:55.100]  aping a real watch and they're fighting against they're fighting against what the pebble is good at and
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.900]  Right fighting it in a direction where one of the things the pebble is good at is unlike a lot of these things pebble actually
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.660]  Gets reasonable battery life, right?
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:07.260]  You know, you can wear it for a couple days at least I can get six days out of it, right?
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.700]  Which is way better than all these other ones
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.740]  And part of the reason they can do that is that they have this really low resolution
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:19.260]  I think it's like 160 by 160 ink display. Yeah
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:25.420]  So it's never going to be able to look pretty nope in a way that a watch looks pretty
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:29.500]  But then you know, they just use like the words or something like that, right and those look good
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.840]  But when they when they and yeah, it's not a very good display
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.780]  But they still tried to ape like a watch with hands and it looks terrible
[01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:42.140]  And I think that I think that's an interesting point of what if what Apple tries to do is
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:47.140]  Not trying to make it look like you'd mistake it for a Swiss watch
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:53.620]  but it's a new and this would be a very Apple thing to do is it's a new thing that you put on your wrist and
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:56.780]  It might even tell you the time but it's not trying to
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.980]  Be mistaken for a Rolex, right? It's just not what it's trying to do right like imagine
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.340]  2007 Steve Jobs says here's the iPhone. He takes it out of his pocket
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:13.060]  The crowd's going nuts and it it would before he turns it on it looks like it exactly the same
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:19.380]  It's a black piece of glass and he turns it on and it turns to the phone dialer
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:26.860]  right that would have been because then that that's using this thing to make it look like whatever we all thought of as a
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.160]  Phone a thing with a you know
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:35.460]  One two three four five six seven eight nine zero underneath a red
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:40.500]  Hang up button a green call button and I don't know like a star button
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.620]  Underneath where you would hit the star button to then access, you know, the other stuff
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.740]  Yeah, I imagine that the dialer is the home screen and you're right. That's exactly the button, right?
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:55.940]  Then it'll show you it'll slide up a thing that shows you apps but like the default is dialing
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:02.260]  right, that's exactly what I was trying to say like that the home screen is a phone dialer because that's a phone and
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:06.840]  that to me is what all the smartwatches have done so far where the home screen is
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.840]  Is
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.600]  Analog wristwatch with an hour hand and a minute hand and
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.480]  And they're all you know, and and the people who are praising like the moto
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:23.480]  360 the people who think it looks good and you know, some of the the samsung ones that just came out
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.360]  They're doing it in a skeuomorphic way
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.320]  The you know aping fine
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:37.260]  analog wristwatches, which is exactly the opposite of everything apple has done software wise in ios 7
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:43.580]  Starting a year ago and with the oseminy coming up imminently. Oh and do you want to compete with those devices?
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.380]  I mean this is going back to your point of like is the
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:51.580]  Is the wide open space of people who don't wear a watch or don't think about watches a better place to go to
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:57.020]  Than people who love watches, which is an interesting idea, but I like the idea that
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:02.540]  Um, you know, you don't want to compete with a rolex because you are not going to win you you know, first off
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:08.620]  You're not a rolex. You're the resolution of your screen and your battery life is never going to compete with that rolex
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.740]  But you do have some other things going for you
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:17.820]  They're not that so don't be that be something be the thing you are be something else, right?
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.860]  That's exactly right and you can compete with the rolex on
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:28.300]  What the thing looks like on your wrist at a distance sure, you know, it's that sort of thing nice materials and all of that
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.220]  But it's not the same device and you know
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.140]  You're not you're not just trying to create a computer that ends up being a watch, right?
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.380]  Good one in the same way that every iphone ever made especially
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.340]  All the ones other than the 3g and 3gs but you know the original one
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.020]  And then back with starting with the four and going through today
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:52.860]  They look like nice devices in your hand even before you turn them on they're just to me
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.580]  aesthetically pleasing
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.580]  pieces of material
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:03.660]  And they can totally compete on it. I just think when it comes to the face whatever it is whether it's a square whether it's
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.300]  Band-aid strip type thing or a circle. I don't know
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.020]  I don't think apple would do a circle because I think it's I think I think a circle is way too
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:16.460]  Skew I think just having a circular screen is skeuomorphic and
[01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:23.260]  You know it anchored in the world of watching. I mean, that's the story motorola tells of how they came to a circle
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.180]  They they did like a they they admit to doing like a focus group where they ask children
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.780]  What do you think a watch looks like and they said a circle and they said, okay
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:36.060]  We'll make our thing a circle and it's like you're asking them what it should be based on
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.860]  The thing you're trying to supplant, right? Right. It's like
[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:46.940]  It's like imagine if apple had decided to make start with the iphone and ask children. Well, what does a telephone look like?
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:52.460]  That's got push buttons, right? They didn't they weren't going to say it looks like the
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:57.740]  The monolith from 2001. Well, this is this is the old faster horse thing, right?
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:01.660]  Which is that you know, do you want to just is your idea of the next thing?
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:07.820]  The you know a better version of the old thing or is it something that's completely different and I think yeah, I feel like you know
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:13.980]  You know people again who have listened to this afterwards laugh and laugh, but I feel like that's what apple
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:21.260]  Ideally would do is throw all that away and say if we're going to do a wearable device what we're not going to do
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.660]  Is make it
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:27.900]  pretend to be the old thing but instead start from zero of like
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.460]  People, you know having something on your body has a lot of benefits
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.100]  It's easier to glance at your wrist and this is one of the reasons I like the notifications in the pebble
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.060]  it's like people always say well, you've got your phone in your pockets like
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:47.100]  You know, my wrist is way more accessible than my pocket and and women who often have to carry their phone in a bag
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:52.380]  You know again their wrist is way more accessible than the phone that's tucked away in the bag
[01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.180]  so that's a benefit and being on your body and being able to do things like read your heart rate and
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.820]  and and uh sense your movements
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.340]  All of that is an advantage to being on there
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:09.180]  So start with the advantages of why you'd want to be on somebody's wrist rather than start with a watch and yeah
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:15.740]  Never underestimate how much the stuff that you've just gotten used to is actually a huge pain in the ass
[01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:22.620]  Yeah, right. I'm sure when indoor plumbing came, you know that there were people who were like, oh my god put a thing
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.700]  I'm gonna crap in right in my house
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:30.700]  No way. I'm, you know, you're gonna put you're gonna put water pipes all throughout the house and and drains
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:33.660]  Do you realize how much harder it's going to be to make a house when you do that?
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:35.580]  Right, exactly
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:38.460]  And then you know, it's of course, of course
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.420]  You don't want to go out and have you know a little just dirty box in your backyard to go to the bathroom
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:46.060]  Very few outhouses anymore
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:51.820]  Yeah, very few outhouses anymore and you know, that's one thing. I was just talking to somebody on twitter
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:57.740]  Just like a random reader who's like, um, hey if this if the watch has nfc and admit, you know
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.380]  Yeah, everybody's excited about this stuff if you know
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.500]  He was like, I know it's a big if but just go with me
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:09.980]  If the watch has nfc and is part of this payments thing, then it's got to have touch it too, right?
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.540]  And my answer was no
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:20.380]  I think it definitely wouldn't have touch id because touch id would be ugly because it's got to be you know, reasonably fingertip sized
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:27.180]  And there's nowhere on a watch to put a fingertip sized thing. That's just for you to put your finger on right?
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.100]  And it's already touching your skin and I know that's not your fingerprint underneath there
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.180]  But I might guess my just random guess I don't know but I just said there's got to be some other
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.060]  Biometric thing that it could maybe do to create an id
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500]  Because I don't think it would have that
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.140]  And
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:49.420]  Then there were other people who like chirped in and they're like it doesn't need a touch id because you'll have your iPhone with you
[01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.500]  And that is touch id so then you can just take your iPhone out and use that for the touch id part
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.940]  Well, then what's the point of having the thing on your wrist, right? There's no point
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.980]  Don't underestimate how much of a pain in the ass it might be that we'd have to take our phone out all the time
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:07.340]  Yep, right. That's to me the key to this, you know having the thing on your wrist like all of a sudden
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.980]  Maybe we start using the iPhone less
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.820]  Well, yeah, I mean if you wave if you imagine going up to the at the drugstore with your bottle of soda
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:21.900]  And you're or you're like, uh, you know milk jug because you ran out of milk and just like waving your wrist
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:29.420]  Like boop and walking out or and then eventually presumably, you know with with rfid just walking out
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:35.180]  Right and you get charged for the milk and that's it then you know that yeah
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:43.340]  That is that is easier than pulling it out of your pocket. It's marginally easier but over time even marginally easier is easier and and
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.340]  easier and and
[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:50.860]  It could be it could be um, you know, marco, uh armant linked to uh,
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:56.220]  Site of one of these like mock-up sites and it was the it was the only um
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.540]  round watch
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:02.700]  Thing that i've seen that I thought I I thought I liked and i'm not saying that apple would do it
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:09.340]  But the one thing that intrigued me about this site is that it was suggesting using the watch metaphor as user interaction
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:14.540]  And what I liked about it was the idea they had actually said it may not even be a touch screen
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:17.100]  That if you if you're going to have a round device
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:21.680]  You could use the ring kind of like the click wheel you could actually use the ring for navigation
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:24.140]  Perhaps you push down or tap
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:29.660]  And you can spin around and then you might even have like some wheels on the side. I I doubt that apple would do it
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.380]  But I thought that was kind of an interesting idea
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.900]  that
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.540]  um, I hadn't really thought of before which is
[01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:38.860]  Could could a device like this?
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:46.620]  Um not be driven by swipes and taps on a touch screen, but some other you know in this case it was spinning
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.100]  Essentially turning a dial turning like like sort of like the old ipod
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.780]  Um, I I thought it was really it wasn't something i'd thought of and I thought it was really interesting
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.820]  I kind of feel I think like like you do that
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.780]  They're much more likely to just kind of walk away from the traditional watch interface and not try to make a
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.340]  Try to make a a watch that looks like a watch but is actually not but instead make a new thing
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:11.020]  But I thought it was an interesting idea of like the other part of apple's history
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:17.900]  Which is this kind of circular navigation thing that I guess if tony fidel were still at apple. Maybe that would be the direction
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:21.580]  I don't know. I I but I wouldn't be surprised though. Like it seems
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:28.620]  There's a great idea in there and it may not be going back to circle, but I think the right idea is
[01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:34.140]  Just because we've gotten used to this doesn't mean the next thing is still going to be this, right?
[01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:40.060]  Right, so we got used to the command line with our apple twos and then the mac came out and there was no command line
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:44.540]  None. Yeah, there were no way to issue commands mind boggling the keyboard, right?
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.520]  It truly was and I know that the people who are born post macintosh
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:56.220]  Cannot that you just can't fathom it a computer was a thing that when you turned on you got a blinking prompt
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.340]  Yep, and you would type computery things and they could be dangerous first time. I saw the mac
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.420]  I thought how do you write programs on this thing?
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:06.540]  Right, somebody tried to explain to me. I was like, I don't understand how that could be
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:10.380]  It just it doesn't make any sense how there could be programs on this
[01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.660]  Well that my thought when I first saw the mac was how do you do something?
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.620]  How do you do the things you need to do that this?
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:22.860]  I was infatuated with the graphical user interface, but you know to me it was like a game
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.940]  It was like the the the interface was a game that let you
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:31.180]  Play computer and I was like, well when you need to do something else, how do you do it?
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.940]  if you don't have a if there's no way to close this I want to close this and get back to the black screen that has a
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.660]  Has a prompt. Yep
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.660]  you know and I was
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.580]  Right, and I remember thinking like oh my god
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:48.300]  And what how are we going to deal with those spaces on the file names when you're on the command line?
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:54.380]  Um, I don't think i'd ever seen a system that had backslashes at that point or if I did i'd never learned it. Um, right
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.420]  And then you know, there was none. It's a new thing and with the um
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.140]  This is actually kind of how I feel about the ipod nano by the way right now
[01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.820]  Which is that it is a weird product that is does feel like it's aping
[01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.700]  Uh, yeah badly the iphone
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:11.740]  Yeah
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:17.260]  Yeah, because it's not ios you can swipe and tap and you when you tap things happen. It's just it's not right
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:23.360]  It's you know, here's a here's a really great example. So a great example to me is the original ipod
[01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:30.300]  And we had handheld devices and they had like navigation and it was up and down left and right, right?
[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:37.660]  It was joystick style or up down up down and all the music players to date used that and the problem the biggest problem was
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:44.060]  It had gotten to the point where it was easy to have a thousand songs and going up up up up up
[01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:51.660]  A thousand times is just no good. You can't do it and holding the button down. It's just you don't have enough control. So that wheel
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:58.620]  It was genius because it had speed it was you know, it was completely under control you could flick it
[01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:03.900]  And all of a sudden you had this new thing that we'd never used before but it was really useful
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:07.820]  And you could use it to navigate literally thousands of songs
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:09.660]  uh
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:14.940]  You know and then you know flash forward 10 years or actually it wasn't 10 years six years. Uh,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:19.340]  Do you believe that? Yeah, the iphone was only six years after the ipod six years
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:26.540]  And you know, we all went in thinking that the iphone was going to be that gag slide of a click wheel with a phone on
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:27.900]  top, right
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:31.900]  Uh, no, so yeah, I do kind of think that I think the nano shows that like you
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.620]  Shrink the size small enough and your finger covers the screen, you know
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:42.540]  And it's it's a problem even on an ipad. It's always a problem that your finger covers what it is
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:48.540]  You're touching when you touch but if you shrink the screen small enough, you can't compensate for it, right?
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:53.340]  You know like on the way that the the perfect example is the way on the the standard iphone keyboard
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:59.420]  Do you love how I now have to refer to it is that the standard iphone keyboard
[01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:04.860]  When you type a key it shows you what you typed above your finger it flashes up
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:11.180]  And that's an affordance for the fact that you can't see which one you're touching because it's underneath your your thumb or your finger
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:18.140]  On something the size of a watch. There's no way to afford that because your thumb covers over half of it
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:22.940]  Exactly. So I I would not be surprised at all. Even if it has
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.900]  a very nice color
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:32.780]  Display that it is not a touch screen because I don't know that touch is right at all for something that size
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:37.340]  especially if it's small and especially if there's a you know a version that
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.380]  That women would want to wear or people with smaller wrists would want to wear at that point
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.700]  You either get these devices that are huge or you get something that's smaller and there's no
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.100]  there's no touch target left at least at least touch in the sense of
[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.420]  uh tapping objects on a screen
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:56.780]  I mean, it's possible that you could do something with touch that is you know
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:22:01.260]  Swiping up and down on the side or something like that as a as a movement
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:05.500]  But it's not the same as like I am going I see a thing and i'm going to touch it with my finger
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.580]  And then it'll do something
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:13.020]  Below a certain size. You just can't do it and the nano is sort of there where it's almost pointless to navigate because
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.500]  You can really only touch on one
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:20.140]  Maybe there's a couple things but it's like what's the point think about the previous generation nano?
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:25.020]  The one that was turned into a watch with the tick tock. Oh, yeah and stuff like that
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:29.660]  Um, and which i've mentioned before on the show that if your smart watch
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:33.100]  Actual smart watch doesn't look better
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:40.460]  Than it than a previous generation ipod nano which wasn't designed to be a watch right on the tick tock
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.700]  Which was a kickstarter project
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:50.460]  Then you've got a serious problem because that wasn't meant to be a watch and some of these smart watches don't look as good as my
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:52.540]  three-year-old
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.340]  Nano on a tick tock, right?
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:01.900]  But I do that on that size touch screen. It's a real problem. I never know what to do
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:07.980]  Yeah, you got like two buttons or four buttons you can tap but it's just and the swipe area is very small
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:10.380]  Right, and it just it's not
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:15.180]  It's a nice try at unifying your product line if you're apple and saying look people are used to this so we'll do it
[01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:17.180]  but it is not
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.660]  If you were designing that in a in a vacuum
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:23.900]  you would not design it that way because it doesn't it doesn't fit right and so I wonder about that whether it's
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.140]  whether it's um
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:32.140]  something like what marco showed me the that is this it's circular and and the ring is like the click wheel or it's something that
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:37.500]  Is a rectangular and you're not expecting to touch on the screen, but but there's some other
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.580]  Interaction, I don't know. It's it's an interesting interesting problem
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.780]  And it will be interesting to see whether apple leans on the side of
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:49.340]  A new interaction or whether they try to make it feel as iphone-like as possible
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:54.700]  I I just can't help coming back to the idea that it what's happened is
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.100]  Everybody in the industry has gotten the ability to make these
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:03.340]  I'm just gonna call them iphone like devices, right?
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:09.500]  All right, there's and everything post pc that we've had android windows phone, whatever you want to call the os and there's you know
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:16.860]  I'm not saying they're all copies. I'm just saying no, they're all derivative of this idea of a touch screen and a unix-like operating system
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.380]  running on
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:19.900]  a real computer
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.500]  under the hood
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:26.540]  And uh a real operating system on top where you can put apps and stuff like that
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:32.460]  And we've gotten to the point where everybody can make one now that is small enough to be called a watch
[01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:37.260]  And maybe not a small watch. In fact, all of these things are kind of huge by the standard of watches
[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:42.800]  But we can make them like dick tracy watch size, which is a remarkable achievement
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:47.420]  And I think that all of the enthusiasm you do see on on
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:52.700]  Sites that are reviewing them and giving them positive reviews, even though they seemingly have glaring
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:25:01.100]  Problems in terms of just is it actually useful and is it actually a good product? I think it's just general excitement of
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.900]  Holy crap, you can have a computer
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:09.340]  On your wrist. Yeah, it's a technological achievement. It really is right. I mean just you know, you and I are
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:15.100]  If not identically aged we're very close in age you go back to the 90s and tell
[01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:21.120]  Jason snell and john gruber that you're going to have a unix computer running on your wrist in the year 2014
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.980]  And i'm gonna i'm thinking holy shit. We're having jet cars and jet packs too, right?
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:29.260]  I mean that's crazy because a unix computer in you know
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.740]  1993 was
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:34.860]  Like a room. Yeah, it was like a refrigerator
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.380]  i'm imagining like uh
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:42.700]  Like uh, one of those wrist things that like space ghost had that's like the side like doubles the size of your wrist
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:45.100]  It's like that's what I would think. It's like well, it's going to be huge
[01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:49.580]  And why would you put that on your wrist not thinking, you know, how how could it be? These are mainframes
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:55.580]  These are like more computer than than a computer and you're going to have that in my in your pocket or on your wrist
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.420]  That's crazy talk
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:02.700]  And so just because you can build it. It's cool that you can but just because you can't doesn't mean that
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.660]  That's actually a good form factor for that and it's exact same
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:10.140]  As thinking the nano and the and the tick tock and the lunatic. I mean showed that right?
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:13.020]  It's like you could do it. It's not that good, but you could do it
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:20.940]  Right, and it's exact same thing of why didn't the original iphone run the mac os where you drag little windows around?
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.660]  And you have a file menu, you know a menu bar at the top
[01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:28.140]  it would have worked at some level conceptually, but it it
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.420]  Definitely would have been a you know would have been a bad idea. Yeah
[01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:35.660]  I mean we would have bought them or we would have reviewed them and it might have been some cool things you could do with
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:40.620]  It i'm sure they would have you know scaled the things up. It wouldn't have been like you're trying to touch a tiny little
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.500]  20 pixel thing at the top
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.060]  But it you know, it just wasn't the right interaction model
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:49.740]  I just can't help but think but that's where the wearables are but everybody else is
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:54.860]  is stuck thinking that they should make a tiny modern cell phone on your wrist and
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.620]  Nobody would want you to you don't want to you don't want a phone that small
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:05.180]  Right. Well, I mean, yeah, I think I think no no sane person would want a phone that small in fact
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:09.420]  I think that's actually a strong argument. I wrote a piece about this a while ago that the idea that um,
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:15.020]  I don't want I don't want something on my wrist to be a phone right like I don't I don't think it's the right place for
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:18.380]  A phone I I wouldn't if you could say you don't need to carry your iphone around anymore
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.540]  I'm going to strap this thing to your wrist and it's your iphone
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:26.620]  I don't think I would want that because it's so it would have to be so small that the way you interacted with it would be
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:33.100]  Difficult and you know, this is why bigger phones are more popular and the rumor is that apple's going to have larger phones
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:40.780]  So what goes on your wrist, you know is it it's that real estate is great, but it's different and and I don't want it to be
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:46.140]  The same interaction because it's not the same. It's not only in a different place in my body
[01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:49.740]  It's it's strapped to my wrist. So i've got to hold my arm in a certain way to get to it
[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:57.260]  Which also means it's one-handed operation because I can't bend my other hand back and it's tiny so it's not
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:02.620]  You know, the rules don't apply even though it's convenient to say hey, it follows the same rules as your phone
[01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.340]  It's not the same place. So the rules should not apply. It's a different device
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:09.340]  Yeah
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.900]  Uh, let's come back to that idea of a big ass iphone
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:16.540]  But at first I want to tell you about our third sponsor and start good friends at hover
[01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.680]  Hover is the domain name registrar
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:22.380]  that doesn't suck
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.340]  and
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.340]  these guys
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:30.860]  I I repeat it every time but it's such a scummy industry and it's it's
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:37.660]  It's like going into the bad part of town. Usually when you go to a domain name registrar hover has been around forever
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:41.740]  They've always just been an honest company. They may not be the cheapest
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:46.300]  Yeah, i'm sure you could go somewhere else and register domain name for less. Uh,
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:50.860]  That's not what they're trying to be. They're trying to be the best and they've been in business for a long time
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:59.820]  And they have so many great features the best one the best thing that they have on my opinion is
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:04.940]  Their customer service and what they call valet transfers
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.940]  They make it easy to manage all your domains in one place
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:12.700]  And so let's say you've been registering domain names like a dummy
[01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:19.340]  Since the mid 90s every time you have a goofy idea for a domain name. I'm not looking at anybody in particular
[01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:25.820]  That sounds familiar to me. Yeah, it probably sounds familiar to a lot of you who are listening right and you've got them registered
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:30.700]  All over the place and every time they come up for renewal and you get the email anything. Oh my god
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.020]  I've had that thing since 1998, but it's still such a funny domain. I better keep it, right?
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:39.520]  It's only 15 bucks or whatever for a couple years day, but they're all over the place and you've got them registered
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.980]  at you know three different places and some of them you don't even like because they're
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.700]  the bad businesses and you go to the website and it's terrible what you can do is you go to hover
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:55.600]  and you sign up at hover and you just give them your information for the places where you have your domain names registered
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.440]  and they'll take care of everything in terms of moving them over and even if you haven't hooked up and they're in use and you
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:07.360]  Have it pointed to a silly, you know single-purpose website where you're making a joke for one of your friends or something like that
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.280]  It's not just moving the domain name into your name and putting it at hover
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:17.120]  They'll take care of everything with updating dns and getting it all pointed the right way so that everything is just seamless
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.880]  And then when the dns updates all of a sudden your domains are registered at hover
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.760]  And all of your sites just keep working and these guys that they know this like I I
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.560]  every time I have to do anything related to dns, I panic because
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.360]  It's so easy to screw up because I don't deal with it on a regular basis
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.040]  Whereas that's all hover does is deal with domain names
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.920]  amazing
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:48.320]  Amazing stuff and it here's the best thing you do if you can find somebody find one of your friends who has a domain name
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.600]  Somebody find one of your friends who has domains at hover
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:59.040]  They will tell you I they'll say you're nuts if you don't move over because it's it's that good. I have 15 domains at hover now
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:05.280]  I might have a problem how many of them in actual use? Oh, well if you can't read I
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.040]  I have a lot of them redirecting where you know
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:10.960]  You buy one and you're like, oh but I could get the.co and I could get this alternate spelling and I could have them
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.040]  All redirect and all of that and a couple that like you said are the jokes where it's like, oh, how could I not?
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:23.760]  We did this in the 200th episode of the incomparable a guy said that wrote in he said we hit him in the butter zone
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.720]  And we just just started laughing and we we that we went with that joke for a long time
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.360]  And I realized I could register the butter zone
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.080]  Right. So I did
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:41.060]  See that's what you can do now with these wacky new top level domains is instead of going to butterzone.com
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:47.220]  Butterzone.com now the entire domain is part of the joke and there's no superfluous non-joke part of the domain
[01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:49.060]  No, it's a hundred percent pure stupid joke
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:54.980]  Oh and they've got all those and that and they're totally on board that I I probably should mention that that they're you know
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:56.980]  with all these goofy new
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.060]  top level domains
[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.660]  You can do that. Uh, you know, I think I think there's a marco coffee
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:06.500]  That everybody should check out probably registered through hover
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:11.700]  All sorts of stuff like that use this code. Here's the code for the month. It's chowder
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:17.300]  Ch ow der that's that's their in joke for daring fireball readers
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:21.620]  And go to hover.com and find out more of my thanks to hover
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:28.500]  So I would smoke so much smoke where there's fire
[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:35.380]  Yep, the thing with two iPhones 4.7 and 5.5 inches. There's still a lot of people out there who are skeptical of it
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:38.340]  I don't know for a fact anything. Nobody tells me anything
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:45.540]  I'm telling you it's got to be true because somebody would have leaked don't don't expect a 5.5 inch iPhone by now
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:49.220]  If there wasn't one coming I agree. There's too much. It's like what we said about um,
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.100]  A couple of these topics earlier that you know, apple
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.660]  apple doesn't leak all this stuff they and they don't like that it leaks but one thing apple does do
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:04.340]  And and you know, you know this and I know this and certainly like the times and the journal
[01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:10.980]  Know this is apple does leak to manage expectations because they are in risk of
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:14.660]  Risk of being harmed if people go into an event
[01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:20.580]  Expecting things that are totally not going to happen because then they'll be disappointed. And so sometimes you will see
[01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:26.900]  These stories where it'll be like look it's they're not going to do this or or what we saw was look
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.380]  It's probably not going to be out until next year right just like don't get don't get your hopes up that it's going to ship
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.340]  Next week. It's probably not going to be out until next year. And I feel like since they haven't said that like you said
[01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:38.980]  They haven't said no. No, there's no bigger iPhone. It's not going to happen
[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:44.180]  That it's probably going to happen because they probably the the buzz is so large
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:47.780]  Probably somebody would have batted it down if it was totally untrue
[01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:53.380]  Especially at this point days before yeah, like and that's why I think there's a bunch
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:57.140]  you know, there does seem to be a spurt of stuff coming out like
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:34:01.620]  Brian x chen it is might be the thing you're talking about. He had a piece in the new york times yesterday
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.300]  Where among other things
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.300]  He said that the new bigger iphones have a
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:15.620]  One-handed mode right which is the thing I made fun of on the samsung galaxy note a year ago
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:19.540]  Which was you know, well, how did in the world do you use these giant phones?
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:23.620]  With when you're only holding it in one hand and
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.140]  You know, the samsung galaxy note had a thing. I forget how you engaged it
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:33.300]  But then all of a sudden it just put like the equivalent of like a regular four-inch phone in the the lower
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.240]  Right corner of the phone and I presume you could also put it in the lower left if you're left-handed
[01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.460]  But then it just you know, and then all the other there's like a big l-shaped
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:50.580]  Letter boxing around it. I have no idea chen does not describe the one-handed mode
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:54.580]  chen does not describe the one-handed mode of
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:35:02.100]  the the new iphone, but I would not be surprised at all if that's true because 5.5 inch phones are
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.580]  ridiculous as
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:06.260]  Phones as we know
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:08.260]  You know i've used
[01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:12.580]  The 5.5 inch or something very close to a 5.5 inch nokia
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:16.900]  When I was at build i've said this before it is a fascinating device
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:22.500]  It is, you know, it seems very intriguing. I think an apple iphone that was that size will sell
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:28.740]  Huge, I don't think a majority of people want that though. I think the people who do are gonna love it
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:33.700]  but one thing there's just no if ands or buts about it, you know, like when um
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:42.740]  When the iphone grew from 3.5 to 4 inches, which was minimal change in size compared to what we're talking about with 5.5 inches
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:45.380]  5.5 inches, um
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:51.300]  There was all sorts of stuff in the event talking about the features in the os that help you so that you know
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:56.820]  Yes, now it's harder to navigate but we have this edge gesture where you can swipe back from the left to go back
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.020]  So you don't have to hit that back button all the way up in the top corner
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.620]  like
[01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:04.500]  There's no way to to mitigate this with
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:09.140]  You know little software tricks like that if you have a 5.5 inch display on your phone
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:15.140]  Even if all of the surrounding area or it was minimized to the most possible degree
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.700]  It's still too big to use in one hand
[01:36:18.020 --> 01:36:22.900]  You have to hold it in one hand and use it in the other and there's no way around it for many people
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:28.580]  That's not that's I I that what I'm I don't think it's a deal breaker. Obviously if apple shipping it they don't either
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.600]  Um, it doesn't mean they shouldn't build the device. It just means in the world of trade-offs
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.760]  People are willing to have x y and z bigger video
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:45.080]  Games that are bigger better battery life, which I want to come back to in a second. Um,
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:52.360]  And they're willing to give up i'm able to use the phone in one hand or if chen is right and there's a mode
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:58.040]  They're willing to invoke what I think is good. Even if apple does it it's gonna be silly sure
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.240]  It's gonna be like what direction are you tilted and it's like oh now it's suddenly this app is smaller and now you can
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:06.360]  Now you can reach the although. I don't know. I don't I don't
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:13.640]  Think about it from an ipad's perspective. I don't I don't worry about not being able to use my ipad in one hand
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:19.320]  Yeah, but you don't walk around the city with it. I know but I mean, but this is a big device
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:23.160]  I mean, yeah, I get that I get that you you there's more need for it than there is on an ipad
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.000]  But i've got an ipad mini and I sometimes I think there is not you know
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.400]  This is an interesting intersection between this very large iphone and the very small ipad
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:36.360]  Where they're well, let me put it. Yeah, let me put it to you this way if brian chen hadn't written that I wouldn't have brought
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.880]  up a one-handed mode
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.720]  With you right on this show because it wouldn't have because it's such a silly thing to me
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:45.880]  That it's such a silly notion to me that it wouldn't have even occurred to me, but he wrote it
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:50.920]  He says is if you know, he doesn't say he's seen it, but he says, you know sources familiar with the matter
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.560]  say that it's going to have it and
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.720]  so
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.680]  Given that and i'm not saying that means it's true. I'm just saying
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:04.120]  You know, it's the new york times and brian x chen. I mean, you know, I have some issues with brian x chen, but
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:11.480]  His his his reporting when he says the source says x is excellent, you know, it's it's typical times quality
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.320]  So like I said, it's not a done deal
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.800]  i'm sure there's some kind of wiggle room out where it could be something else entirely and it was mistaken as a
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:26.120]  One-handed mode but or they tried it and it didn't you know, right
[01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:30.760]  And go or it didn't make it into the final version, but I would not be surprised at all having
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.360]  Played with one of these devices. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did it, you know if there's some kind of thing
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.880]  Maybe it's just in the control center and you flick up from the bottom and there's a new button you can hit and it shrinks
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.880]  The screen to the lower right corner
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.400]  I don't know. I think it would be silly but I wouldn't be surprised if they did it
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.960]  Because these phones are ridiculously big compared to
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.240]  What we're used to so if you've built your usage, you know, here's how I typically use my phone. I have
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:03.000]  Often using it while holding it in the same device you're using it with you're not going to be able to do that with the new
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.960]  device, I think that's that's where it comes into into
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:14.120]  Being an issue because for me I think about large device and I think this is basically the smallest ipad we can
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.280]  Put in your pocket
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.160]  right
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:24.360]  Put in your pocket, right? Um, not the biggest iphone and that's not true. Although um, I saw on twitter. Um,
[01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:32.120]  Today that steve trout and smith who likes to poke around in xcode and find weird things seems to suggest that
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.260]  If you're if you're using a screen size like that and you're in landscape
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.280]  It actually uses ipad resources, which is really interesting
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.280]  Like it's just big enough that you might be able to use an ipad view
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:52.540]  And um, of course then you're then you're almost certainly not doing it one-handed if you're if you're tilting it sideways
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:58.200]  Um, but I don't know. I it's a funny. It's a funny intersection because like I said, I really love my ipad mini
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:04.120]  Um, and I wonder sometimes about could I get away with one device if it was bigger than my iphone
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.240]  But smaller than my mini would it be good enough that I wouldn't need to
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.080]  Or would it be just bad on both counts? I don't know that that come back that comes right back to that
[01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:20.620]  Right back to that wwdc session that i've been recommending people. I think it's session 216, which is building adaptive layouts
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:25.900]  Which is apple's terminology for flexible layouts or responsive layouts, but in their terminology
[01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:30.460]  They don't call them phone width or tablet width. They call it like regular width
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:33.900]  compact width regular height compact height
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:41.740]  Um, and so like an ipad is like regular width regular height, like you can show the full interface a phone
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:48.540]  Is regular height so you can put like a big scrolling list, but it's called a compact width
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:56.700]  A regular iphone like an iphone today, even when you turn it in landscape is still a compact width
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.180]  Like it's not a specific number of pixels or points. It just says
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.500]  it just says like um
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:09.660]  A compact width even held horizontally just means hey mail
[01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:16.620]  If you're showing a list just show one list at a time and don't show the list side by side with the content
[01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.300]  um
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:25.120]  Whereas what he's saying and that's very interesting to me would be that just the 5.5 inch iphone if you hold it horizontally
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.640]  When you're in mail, you'll suddenly see a list of messages taking like the first third and when you select one
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:36.400]  You'll see the message on the right right like an ipad right or that settings will have a list on the left side
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:39.440]  And then the pane on the right instead of it being something you enter into
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:46.880]  Right, and if you think about that, I I believe that and not just because he's he's a great twitter accountant. He's very very astute
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.880]  Hacker in the best sense of hacker in terms of it's
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.160]  Sluicing those things out of the beta x codes and stuff
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.980]  But I believe it because I think that's the message apple has been preaching especially this year at wwdc
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.920]  Is to stop thinking about iphone apps and ipad apps
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:11.040]  and so don't think of the 5.5 inch iphone as just a big iphone or
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.120]  Perhaps and there's I have so many people on twitter, you know twitter and email who think hey, maybe it's not an iphone at all
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.400]  maybe it's a
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.600]  uh ipad nano and it'll run ipad apps
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.400]  Well, no, it's too small to run ipad apps
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.040]  it you know, it's just if you really really, you know, take an ipad app and just
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.880]  Shrink it to 5.5 inches and print it out on a piece of paper. You'll see immediately that everything is too small to touch
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.700]  But it totally makes sense to me that if you held it sideways
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:46.800]  That you could sort of give it an ipad ish layout if not it but not by shrinking
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.720]  by shrinking
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.120]  The ipad interface exactly. You know what? I mean? Yep. It's it's just hey
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.560]  use one third of the screen for the list the other two-thirds of the screen for the content and
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.880]  Figure it out dynamically based on how many points there are how big the things should be
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:07.520]  Well, it's like totally believe it's like a response of html breakpoint where you're basically the os is saying look
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:13.440]  Yeah, we say that this device is big enough that it can handle two two things at once and then the apps go. All right
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:18.000]  Yeah, i'll i'll put that up there then because the apps are already thinking about sort of like when is it too small?
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.240]  I mean ios developers already are thinking of this when is it too small? When is it too big?
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:28.240]  I've got this one design for ipads and one for iphones and it's not that unreasonable to think but it's an interesting idea
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.640]  Because then you've got this this phone that's sort of like a phone when it's being held in one direction
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:38.640]  And sort of like an ipad when it's held in another direction and I I do I wonder about the the market for this
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:45.200]  Device because when I talk to people who've written about or or or use um fablets
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.360]  This is what comes up a lot of the time is people like it because they don't really care that it's huge
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.080]  They don't really use it as a phone. Uh, you know a
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.680]  That word again a you know, hello. How's it going? How are the yankees doing? Right, right?
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:03.520]  Because you do and admittedly let's just get out of the way you look ridiculous talking on one of these
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.240]  But if you always talk on your phone using a headset or you know
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:08.240]  Like I I never hold my phone to my ear
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:12.560]  Anyway, i've always got headphones in and so it doesn't matter and if you got a bluetooth thing
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.360]  It doesn't matter and then you otherwise you've got the cellular connected internet thing and it's bigger
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.920]  So this so the screen is bigger and you can see well stuff and don't just don't even underestimate the fact that you know
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.960]  What if you're only on the phone for two minutes who cares if you look ridiculous?
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.520]  You know get used to it because it's like I said, I think it was with hockenberry last week. I was like, you know
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:35.840]  People do i've gotten over making fun of them, but people do look ridiculous
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.320]  Using an ipad as a camera, but guess what?
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:45.120]  There's like probably two million people right now as we speak using an ipad somewhere in the world as a camera and get over it
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.520]  This is what they do, you know? Yeah, because they're they're
[01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:51.760]  It's the tool that's at hand and it works for them and it fits into their lives
[01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:55.040]  I mean, it's hard to talk about hockenberry about any of this stuff because you know
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.000]  He's so huge that this would be a nicely dainty phone for him
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:02.320]  Yeah, he's finally gonna know what we've thought. He's gonna I think he's gonna be so happy
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.720]  He's gonna be like, oh my god. This is what it's been like for you guys
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:10.880]  Yeah, because right the current phone he like just kind of holds between two fingers and it's like well
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.440]  it's like the current phone for him is like what we were talking about using the
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.040]  The ipod man. Oh, yeah, that's right. And it's
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.360]  How do you get your big meaty fingers on this thing? So yeah, he'll be happy
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:28.720]  You know, I was certainly a skeptic, you know at first when the android phones got super big
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.560]  um
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.560]  Because it didn't I didn't see the appeal
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.560]  um, but you know, I turned around and even when I wrote my iphone
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.560]  5 review two years ago
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.520]  I said look the big bigger phones are here to stay because I was skeptical
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:45.120]  Even when I had it and reviewed it of the change from 3.5 to 4
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.560]  But clearly, you know, there's desire for it i'm still a little
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:59.840]  Interested in why they went to two bigger sizes rather than keeping the four in size and having one bigger size
[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:05.600]  But I think I think there's a question about what if this is true what happens next year because I do wonder if at some point
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:14.160]  Uh, they abandon the smaller size the five size or do they keep that size around and and upgrade that size?
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:16.800]  with better hardware on the inside and sort of end up with
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.480]  Because I think we're going to end up with three sizes because they'll keep around some version of the five as their third product
[01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:28.160]  That's the question is do is that a viable size going forward because that would be kind of nice if they said no
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.760]  We're going to keep that size around and it's never going to be our biggest newest hottest thing
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:36.160]  But we'll we'll keep it around with the previous year's specs or whatever put into it
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.840]  And we've got three sizes now not two and the old model but three iphone sizes, right?
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.360]  Even though there doesn't seem to be one new one of that size coming this right, but they don't necessarily need to do that
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.280]  I mean they could put the 5s
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.680]  Keep it keep it around and it's perfectly good or put a colorful shell on it and it's the 5
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:58.000]  S c or whatever. I mean they could totally do that if they wanted to or just keep the 5c
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:03.920]  right, but I do think I i'm predicting that the message on stage tuesday is going to be
[01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:09.360]  4.7 is better than 4.0 for the size that you're used to now, right?
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:12.560]  And you're going to think it's big at first but trust us you'll get used to it
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.880]  And this is the right size and you know
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:20.160]  we've we've done it now because we can build bigger screens and we have bigger batteries and that
[01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:23.760]  Whether it's true or not. We won't know until we you know get to use them, but
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:28.400]  They're gonna say I think they're gonna pitch the 4.7 is you know, yes, it's bigger
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:34.000]  But it's bigger only in good ways right and then they're gonna say the 5.5 is an altogether different experience
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:39.440]  It's for people and they'll tell a story about who it's for and you gotta get you gotta credit a company like samsung
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:42.640]  And like I can't believe i'm saying that but but follow me here, you know, apple
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.400]  Apple is a company that picks its spot and they they looked at the bell curve and said this is the right size phone
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:51.200]  This is the right size phone. This is like if we could only make one
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.080]  This is the one because this is gonna fit best
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:00.240]  And what samsung did because this is what samsung does is they made a phone like every size possible
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.960]  right just to see
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:10.640]  What would happen and one of the things they discovered it's like a scientist like looking for a a planet like an exoplanet, right?
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:16.640]  Where where you're looking at data and you're trying to find some signal in the noise and I feel like what what samsung did
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.120]  Was look at that chart and say well, okay people like phones
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.520]  There's a bump around where the iphone is and there's a bump above it people do like the bigger screens
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:28.800]  And then there's this weird thing that happened over here with the note
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:35.360]  Which is there's another market for that and it's not as big a market as that smaller phone. It's not it's a weird
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.920]  Market, it's more of a niche, but it's a it's a big niche. It's bigger than we thought and you know
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.240]  That is something that maybe you know until somebody tried it. Nobody would know and and to samsung's credit with the note
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.720]  They tried it and they found it out and and it's led everybody else to realize
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:49:00.080]  Oh, you know what? It's weird and not what we thought but some people just want to have the huge phone and and and and so apple
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.440]  uh going into that market doesn't necessarily mean
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.160]  It's uh apple's failure because I do think apple strategy all along was like look we're going to pick the size and then later
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.360]  we'll deal with spreading out the product line, but it is uh, at least in part because
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.520]  um, samsung went there and uncovered this market that was unexpected and um,
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.280]  You know apple because apple's already got the ipad and the ipad mini apple's not in a bad position to to try that
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.840]  Now that they are spreading it out. They would never make that their only phone but but adding it in
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.520]  It's just it's none of us looked at that. I mean we all laughed at the note, right?
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.520]  It's like why would you do this and it turns out some it works for some people
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:42.960]  So here we are but so full credit to samsung for you know
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.000]  Doing the old t-shirt cannon just covering the whole landscape and figuring it out
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.880]  They certainly they certainly had the first big ones that were hits. Um, but I remember noting
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.680]  I don't know three years ago
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.640]  When when a lot of android phones started going past the five inch mark, right?
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.240]  Right because in between four and five was bigger than the iphone
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:09.920]  But I I played with those devices and yeah, you noticed that it was bigger, but it didn't seem huge
[01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:15.440]  And then five to me is the marker where once you're past five, that's a really big device
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:18.160]  um
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:23.840]  And a bunch of android phones went over there and they and the thing that I always know is that this they didn't have
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.520]  Four inch models too. They only had the big ones
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.240]  And I believed them my theory then and I still think it was true at the time
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:37.760]  Was that for a lot of them they did it because it was the only way they could get a reasonable battery life
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:42.240]  That they made this and the screens weren't super high res either, you know
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.920]  They made them big and they weren't super high res. I mean they weren't necessarily bad
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:53.360]  But it it just didn't seem to be a lot. I I just the fact that they didn't have iphone sized ones
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:51:01.280]  Even though the iphone was by far and still is the most popular size smartphone or phone if i'm going to follow my own advice
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:02.480]  um
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.800]  It just seemed to me that they had to go big and the reason I could think that they had to go big is
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.800]  That they needed the battery
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.640]  But then I think a side effect of that as android evolved to to software wise, you know
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.440]  Take advantage of that because the other thing too the first ones they just blew the android interface up
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:26.320]  It was just you know an interface that was kind of designed for the original size androids which were about the iphone size
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.000]  And they just blew it up
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:34.560]  But and I think that might be too where samsung does I can't believe i'm saying it does deserve the credit where I think that
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:39.360]  The reason like the note was popular was that the note had software that was meant to
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.320]  Be on a 5.5 inch screen have the it had their all their crazy stylus stuff, right?
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:49.280]  Because they stuck a stylus on it right and it hit it hit a segment of the market
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.760]  That wanted it and it was a different segment, you know, and it's a totally reasonable
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:57.680]  So I do think factor one is yes, there are some people
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:04.080]  Side enough of them that it's a a market worth going after who really and truly want a bigger phone
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.960]  For whatever the reason doesn't matter whether it's for games whether it's because they watch a lot of tv
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:12.640]  You know video youtube on the phone and undeniably if you're watching
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:18.560]  Youtube or baseball games in our case on a phone the bigger the screen the better no doubt about it
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:22.000]  Maybe it's like big businesses also have come to them and said, you know
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.880]  we want to buy units for all of our people who are in the field and we want it to be big and
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:31.920]  Full-featured because we're not going to get them a tab. We want them out there without a tablet without a laptop
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.760]  They're going to have one and we want it to be bigger and apple listens to those guys and says oh wow
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:42.160]  There's a sale opportunity there too. I don't know it almost doesn't matter why you can almost just abstract it and say look
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:47.840]  there's a bunch of people who want a bigger screen for these reasons and so they get the bigger screen and
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:54.480]  Secondarily, and I think this is huge. I I would not be surprised if this is a big part of the message on
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:53:01.040]  Tuesday, is that making the phone that big yes, there's all sorts of other trade-offs with one-handed use etc, etc
[01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.200]  But all of a sudden you've got this enormous room to put a battery
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.360]  Right. Oh, yeah, and so there's there's like a battery team at apple, right?
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:12.960]  And you know that these guys and they've even been featured in the videos, you know
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.880]  Like when they've talked about the reasons why they've stopped making replaceable batteries and macbooks
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:18.880]  and stuff like that and about
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:25.520]  Taking every single bit of space that they can get to, you know, put more battery in there and smarter batteries
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:26.960]  um
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.200]  There is a team at apple that works on, you know, iphone batteries and when they I think when they were told okay
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:38.000]  Here's how big we're going to make this this phone. They were like, oh my god, that's so beautiful, right?
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.000]  Well, this is the greatest day of my life
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.200]  I feel like those guys are doing an algebra problem and have been from the beginning that they've been solving for
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:50.960]  What apple considers sort of like optimal battery life and that that if you've noticed over the years with the iphone the battery life
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:58.000]  doesn't change very much and obviously the capacity changes a lot and the the energy consumption of the device changes a lot
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:02.320]  But in the end what they quote as battery life doesn't change very much
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.680]  And so it's very clear to me that they're they're solving for that battery life
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:12.400]  Like that's what the number we want to hit that's acceptable battery life and people who really use and abuse their phones say it's not enough
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:16.480]  It's not enough and i've got to have a backup battery or I got to put it in a case, but apple's like
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:19.760]  Decided this is this is what we can fit
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:26.080]  Uh as a balance that works for us with these new phones being larger and especially the very large one
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:29.920]  That's one of my questions is is this do those battery guys?
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:37.520]  Say finally we can do we can we can also address this other issue, which is if you want your iphone to last for two days
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.000]  Uh, or a day and a half or whatever it is twice what it can now
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:44.720]  This model will be able to do that
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:47.280]  That's what I and I think that's I don't know if it's going to be twice
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.600]  But I do think it's going to be something like hey this bigger fun. Maybe they won't tell us how much
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.160]  This particular number it's not going to be another 10 hour battery, right? Presumably, right?
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.160]  No, I and I think so. I think the 4.7 inch one will come out with
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:06.800]  With iphone as we know it like battery life. They'll solve for that number again, right and the five
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.440]  Will use the same amount of energy for everything else because I think it's going to have the same cpu same camera
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  the same everything else
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:19.440]  Except this bigger screen, which I also expect to be
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.040]  Even higher resolution and so I and I I think they can do that and have it only consume
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:26.880]  um
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.880]  Maybe like 20 more power
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.880]  Maybe 30 more power than the 4.7 inch one's screen
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.360]  But they're going to have way more than 20 or 30 percent more room for battery
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.160]  Right because the way more just the volume when you do the math of volume of one of these devices and you add that much
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:48.160]  Screen, I mean it doesn't seem like a lot but when the other dimensions are so small you add that extra screen and the volume
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.160]  Is just vastly larger
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:57.280]  Right and so when people have said, you know, like in disputing my projections on the the displays of the two phones
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.920]  Well, if the one goes 3x the other one has to go 3x
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:06.160]  And I think one of the big reasons that it can't because you can find a 3x resolution for the four
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.320]  That would solve all the other problems
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:14.720]  I brought up about the tap target sizes and the scaling factors and showing more content. You can definitely do it. The problem is
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.280]  That one would take 20 more power and they don't have more room for the battery and have no more
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.760]  0 percent more room for the battery
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.920]  And I think they'll maybe they'll get there eventually, you know, just through the way that everything gets more efficient over time
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.920]  But I feel like right out of the gate side by side
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.880]  One of the main features of the bigger the 5.5 inch iPhone is going to be amazing battery life
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.480]  At least amazing by the standards of iPhones as we know them
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.920]  And so I think that actually is going to create a second class of people who want the 5.5 inch
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.640]  I agree first class first class is who we said before people who want the bigger screen
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.200]  Even if they had the same battery life even side by side, they both get 10 hours of battery life
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  Well a whole bunch of people want the 5.5
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.920]  But I think the second class is if it gets 18 hours of battery life instead of 10. Yep
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.520]  There will be people who get it and they'll say damn this thing is big. I don't like this
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:14.960]  This is big but wow
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:20.720]  I need this battery life because they live on their phones right and they'll be willing to put up with it and that might be
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:24.160]  Why they're putting in like a one-handed mode?
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.160]  right because there's I think there's to me just
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:36.960]  You know sucking all these last-minute rumors in that to me makes sense that maybe there's a one-handed mode only on the 5.5 inch phone
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.240]  I don't think the 4.7 inch phone will need it. I think they're gonna make maybe even if this is all true
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:45.680]  They'll even say the 4.7 inch phone doesn't need it and we know it's bigger
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:50.080]  We know it's a little harder to use with one hand, but you could definitely still do it the 5.5 inch one
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.040]  You can't and if that's what you want to do, here's how you do it
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:59.200]  But I think the battery life is gonna draw people in who otherwise would never have bought the 5.5 inch one
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:02.160]  Yeah, I think I think you're right. I think that's gonna be part of the story
[01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:08.480]  It's like you want more screen you want bigger battery life all these things we have a model for you now here it is and
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.680]  That may also speak to those that that business scenario of you know
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:14.160]  I've got somebody out on the road and I want to set them send them
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.120]  There with one device and you know and it's got 17 hour battery on top of it
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:25.760]  So this is it you take this out in the field you whatever you are cable repairman or yeah, yeah, whoever oil
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:31.760]  Industry guy or whatever those you know, those those enterprises exist. So that's another market for it
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:36.960]  I agree because otherwise if all that they're selling as well, you know bigger screen, whatever it's less competitive
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:45.120]  whatever it's less compelling but you know, there are the battery is one of the very easy bits of math to do and say well
[01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:51.040]  You're gonna have more room for battery and the components are not going to be larger. So, of course, there's going to be more battery
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:59.440]  Yeah, I think that that one device angle is a huge part of the the five point whatever inch phone craze
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:04.400]  You know that it's for people who don't want to have a tablet and a thing or don't even want to take a notebook
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.800]  You know a MacBook and a phone with them. They you know, maybe
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:13.280]  you know, maybe it's not the only computing device in their life, but maybe it's a
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.040]  desktop computer somewhere sitting on a desk and a
[01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:24.880]  5.5 inch phone and that's it. And if you're there away from the desk, you know where they can run Photoshop
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:30.320]  You know or Xcode or something like that that truly needs still needs like a real Mac
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:35.680]  Everything else one device, right? And I think that's exactly what this device is supposed to be
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:40.480]  I mean, it's great if you're somebody like like us who's got an iPhone and an iPad and a laptop
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:46.480]  But I do talk to people who who say I'm not gonna have a tablet and a phone, right?
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:49.600]  Especially since the tablet isn't isn't subsidized
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:56.560]  So they've got an iPad but it's an iPad 2 and they don't know when they're gonna replace it and all but they get a new phone every other year
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:05.440]  Right. So for them, this is a better deal potentially if it can can fulfill what they would use a tablet for
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:11.520]  Enough for them to get by without needing the tablet and it could it's possible
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.400]  Yeah, yeah
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:16.800]  and I think it you know in terms of any kind of skepticism because ah
[02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:24.720]  But this what you guys are trying to tell me that Apple's gonna make it easier for someone to not buy both an iPhone and an iPad
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:30.400]  That doesn't make any sense. Of course, they want them there, you know, their capitalist company
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:36.800]  I think it just gets back to that whole lack of fear of cannibalization in Apple where
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.800]  As long as you're talking about not buying a second Apple product, but you're still buying an Apple product
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:44.640]  we your
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:50.240]  Double thumbs up from Tim Cook to you as opposed to somebody who's buying a Samsung
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:57.340]  Galaxy, whatever that's five point five inches because that's when it's a problem when it's not an Apple device
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:00.300]  I also think there's the confidence in knowing that this this is a niche
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:07.580]  Market, this is this is not the mainstream that they're gonna sell more of the smaller phones and they're gonna sell more iPads
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:09.020]  Then you know
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.020]  They're not gonna that the most common
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:15.820]  Scenario is not gonna be everybody stops buying iPads and small iPhones and buys a giant iPhone
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:20.780]  They know they know that's not gonna happen. And so this audience is not being served by them right now
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:26.860]  We're not being served well by them, right? And I think that they have confidence knowing, you know from decades
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.580]  You know multiple decades of the Mac
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:35.340]  That a wide range of form factors and price ranges is just fine
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:42.020]  Yeah, and doesn't necessarily cannibalize anything, you know that the fact that there is an eight hundred and ninety nine dollar MacBook Air
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:44.100]  Which is an excellent computer
[02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:46.100]  it doesn't mean that the
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:48.460]  27-inch iMac is going away
[02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:48.940]  well
[02:01:48.940 --> 02:01:54.220]  and actually it's something that brings up to is I don't know what they're gonna name these things but I
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:58.980]  I've started to think of the iPhone and think of it a little bit like the
[02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:05.780]  The Mac which is I'm not entirely sure that they won't just say these are the iPhone 6 or whatever and that there's a big
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:10.380]  One and a small one. I mean, I'm not a hundred percent convinced that's true, but I've had people tell me
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:14.300]  Well, of course, they're gonna have different names and I think well MacBook Air comes in two sizes
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:18.340]  MacBook Pro comes in two sizes iMac comes in two sizes
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:26.140]  The iPhone could come in two sizes without them calling one of them iPhone mini or iPhone huge and it would be fine
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:29.380]  It's the new iPhone and you can get the big one or the small one. I
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:32.060]  Don't know whether they'll do that or not, but they could
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:37.700]  Yeah, I think the and it's it's funny too cuz I'm terrible at predicting the names. I am so bad
[02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:40.580]  I guess I should go on a record and make a prediction but I
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:43.260]  if I had to my prediction would be that the
[02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:46.060]  4.7 inch one would be called the iPhone air
[02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:48.140]  or
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:50.820]  iPhone 6 air but that to me is already a mouthful
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:56.180]  Yeah, so I say drop the numbers and say iPhone air and the big one is the iPhone Pro, huh?
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.900]  And I I don't like it
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:02.860]  Well, I don't like it in a couple reasons though
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:08.540]  Because one reason I don't like it is I do think they're gonna have the same performance. Yeah, like a8 performance
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:13.420]  And does that make sense to have Aaron Pro the Pro somehow feels like it ought to be faster
[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:20.380]  But I don't know but I I just feel Pro because they've used it before and it's more expensive
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:24.960]  It sounds like it should be more expensive. Yeah, I don't know if the iPhone can be proud that you're right
[02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:30.220]  Maybe well like the thing I can't see them doing is picking some adjective. That means big no
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:34.100]  No, that doesn't it doesn't I mean I joked about iPhone huge, but it's a terrible
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:37.900]  I mean you can't know if I had if I had to make a bet
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:42.360]  I would probably bet that they're just gonna call them the iPhone 6 and there's two models, right?
[02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:44.540]  But it wouldn't what size do you want?
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:44.740]  Yeah
[02:03:44.740 --> 02:03:51.220]  but it wouldn't shock me if if it was the iPhone 6 and the iPhone air or if it was no but because they're never gonna
[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:55.980]  Prioritize the big one because the big ones the niche product. So it'll be the iPhone 6 or air and then I
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:58.980]  Just have a hard time. I I think the best
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:04.740]  Pro they could do but I'm inclined to just guess that they're gonna say there's two iPhone sixes
[02:04:04.740 --> 02:04:06.740]  Which one do you want big one at a little one?
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:12.500]  And then well and the other thing I've seen people say that the big one will be called the iPhone air
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:16.420]  But I think they're they're myopic doesn't make their only doesn't make it
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:21.180]  Well, they're looking at the they're looking at the iPads
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:24.680]  Where right the bigger iPad is the air that's true
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:32.120]  right, but the other one has a name called the mini which puts it in order and the air is really kind of
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:34.680]  It's sort of an in joke or not in joke
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:40.680]  but it's like a reference to all previous iPads where it's so much lighter than the iPad used to be and
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:44.880]  They're never gonna call the mainstream iPhone the iPhone mini. That's kind of crazy
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:51.840]  No, right and they can't call a one that's four point seven inches the mini because bigger it's bigger way bigger
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:59.280]  Significantly, but maybe not way bigger but significantly bigger than any iPhone ever made so they can't say here's this new four point seven inch screen
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:03.460]  It's significantly bigger. It has wait a million more pixels and all this
[02:05:03.980 --> 02:05:09.480]  Shows all this here's how much more content you see and it's called the mini. No doesn't make it happen. I
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.280]  Have one more sponsor to read now when I want to get back to that
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:16.400]  This thing about us me and you know in the name, right?
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.700]  All right. Our last sponsor of the day is our good friends at
[02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:21.380]  a transporter
[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:23.220]  from connected data
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.220]  So would you like your own private cloud that lets you secure?
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:33.700]  Least or and share files in a way that is completely private and resistant to governmental snooping or
[02:05:34.420 --> 02:05:40.240]  To any other sort of unfortunate things that can happen through the public cloud services
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.700]  Which may or may not have been publicized recently
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:49.620]  That's what file transporter is you buy a file transporter from them or more than one?
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:53.980]  It's a device that comes to your home. It has a hard drive built into it
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:58.980]  you plug it in you put it on your Wi-Fi you install software on your Mac and
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:05.500]  all of a sudden you have a Dropbox like folder on your Mac that shows the contents of that device and
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:10.300]  you put something in the folder and it goes on the device and it's on your hard drive too and
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:12.460]  You can then
[02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:18.780]  log into a different computer log into your transporter account and the same files show up there and
[02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:25.140]  Then you could buy a second device and you could put it in a different location and you use the same account and the same
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:28.620]  Files will go from here to there to there
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:34.220]  But it's only there the data is only on if you have one file transporter
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:39.260]  That's the only place where your data is other than on your Macs that you log into your Macs
[02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.020]  If you have a second one
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:47.340]  it'll sync between the two the only thing they go through the cloud and their servers for is the
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:54.860]  Negotiation to poke holes through the set up appear to peer to poke through the router. They don't have any
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:07:03.340]  Kind of storage in the cloud for your stuff. Your stuff is only searched stored on the devices that you hold in your hand
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.180]  Big difference from
[02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:10.780]  Cloud based services really really appealing to many people
[02:07:11.620 --> 02:07:12.740]  and
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:18.300]  If it appeals to you, I encourage you check this out because I don't know of any other way to do this
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:23.940]  Then file transporter I have one here works like a charm
[02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:29.340]  Really good stuff they have two ways to get one
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:33.980]  The regular file transporter comes with a built-in
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:38.740]  Hard disk they have 500 gigabyte 1 terabyte 2 terabyte capacities
[02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:45.020]  if you buy one and want to buy one of those use this code TTS like the talk show TTS 10 and
[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:48.760]  You'll save 10% off your purchase
[02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:56.500]  The other way to do it is you can buy the transporter sync. That's the one that's like a little Apple TV size puck and
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:00.340]  That one you just take a USB drive any USB drive
[02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:05.400]  You already have big hard drive sitting around you want to buy your own hard drives you just buy your own hard drives and plug
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.740]  It in by USB. So that's a cheaper gadget
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:10.820]  Because you're supplying your own hard drive
[02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:15.460]  You could save 20 bucks when you buy one of those with this code TTS
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:17.300]  20
[02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:23.020]  All orders using either of those codes get free shipping. So use those codes
[02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:26.060]  By the one you want. Here's where you go file
[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:28.740]  transporter store
[02:08:28.740 --> 02:08:30.740]  calm
[02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:36.860]  Www.file transporter store.com and remember those codes TTS 10 and
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:39.900]  TTS 20
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:43.180]  So wrapping up the show you ever been going a long time, but there's lots to talk about
[02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:43.820]  But here's the thing
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:50.060]  I am inundated this week more than any other previous Apple event with people who think that I've already got a watch
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:52.540]  I've already got
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:56.620]  I've already got an iPhone how it works folks it
[02:08:56.620 --> 02:09:00.260]  To mine. I certainly has never worked that way with me
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:05.460]  it's certainly never worked that way with anybody who I know like my friends like you in the industry and
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:14.060]  It's also to my knowledge never worked that way for anybody not before they announce it not before they announce it
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:20.020]  That they just don't do that now like, you know that why they don't they you know
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:22.660]  The whole point of the announcement is they don't want anybody including us
[02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:29.980]  To see it. And in fact, the reason they invite us to the event is that they want us to see it for the first time
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:37.100]  Specifically the way that they're going to do it, right whether it's going to be projected on a screen
[02:09:37.100 --> 02:09:43.040]  Or it's going to come out of a pedestal in the middle of the floor like the I think there was that the iPhone 5
[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:46.560]  Yeah, they've used that trick a couple of times. All right, but you know
[02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.660]  Whatever it is
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:55.020]  Smoke, whatever. It's great. But I know and I don't know a lot about how they prep the keynotes
[02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:58.100]  I don't know, you know, they're very secretive just about the whole process
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:01.540]  but I do know that they go out like Phil Schiller and
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:06.180]  Everybody else who's there will go out to like seats in the room and like do it again
[02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:10.580]  And I want to see what it's like from here, you know, and then when Steve Jobs was was around
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:12.900]  you know that he would go out he would go out and sit in the audience and
[02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:17.860]  See, you know that that's how we find out this stuff. You know, we don't
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:23.060]  We definitely don't know the names and I think my track record over the years of predicting
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.920]  Product names should should prove that
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:31.500]  And if we did know we wouldn't be able to make predictions, right? That's true. That's true
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:34.380]  And the fact that we do make predictions shows how little we know
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:42.060]  Right, and if somebody whispers something to me who's not you know feeding it to me officially in any fish official capacity, which is always
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:44.820]  accompanied by
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:46.300]  Oh
[02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:52.100]  What would you call the non-disclosure agreement right like when you do get an embargo or an NDA, right?
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:55.300]  I don't know, you know, I read I'd try to skim over it
[02:10:55.300 --> 02:11:02.060]  But like when we do get like a review unit before after it's been announced always after right? It's been announced
[02:11:02.540 --> 02:11:09.420]  But before it's available in stores, it's there's a thing that says here, you know, and like for example, you know the
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:14.380]  Dude, usually it's like the last couple years. There's an iPhone event on a Tuesday and
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:21.420]  People who get reviewing it you sign a thing and it says the embargo is until
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:27.740]  6 p.m. Pacific the next Wednesday and then the fact that at 601
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:31.220]  Pacific the next Wednesday, there's
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:38.820]  Everybody's story gets posted. Yep, right. That's not a coincidence. That's because it's everybody has agreed to that, you know and
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:47.220]  Nobody knows anything before that and nobody is allowed to publish anything after they know it before that date. It's
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.660]  It works. It's it's a lot more obvious how it works
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:55.820]  And you think there is no secret cabal of people who are filled in before the event
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:02.560]  No, because then what you'd get is you'd get your David Pogue or Walt Mossberg or whatever writing a story about the product
[02:12:03.180 --> 02:12:08.340]  The moment the product got announced and that doesn't happen. They I mean back like when that that
[02:12:08.860 --> 02:12:14.220]  The iMac with the flat panel screen and the arm got a leaked by Time magazine, right?
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:17.460]  I mean that they used to do it back then but they don't they don't do it anymore
[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:19.460]  They haven't done it for more than a decade
[02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:21.540]  right, and I do think
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:27.200]  You know and and part of it is just their their go-to market strategy
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.340]  I mean and you know, my eyes are open. I mean, I know that that's part of it. Is that if
[02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:37.940]  The thing is announced on a Tuesday and then the embargo date is eight days later on a Wednesday
[02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:41.660]  And then the thing actually goes on sale two days later Friday
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:48.700]  that that's all according to the schedule of what they think maximizes interest in the people who on Friday will
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:56.160]  Go and and you know fork stuff over exactly, but I I also do think though that part of that too though is is
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:03.100]  That they really do want reviewers to have to spend a week. Yeah ice before they write it
[02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:09.700]  Yeah that they don't want reviewer, you know, they they wouldn't want you to write a review to race, you know
[02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:14.140]  Okay, you can hear here's your here's your new iPhone. You can write your review whenever you want
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:20.580]  I don't think they would do that happened to me with the first iPad and that was the worst because they announced that and then
[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:26.700]  They did their event saying it was gonna ship and there were embargo reviews that dropped and I wasn't part of that
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.540]  But then I got one
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:35.700]  Basically the day the embargo reviews dropped or the next day and I said is there any embargo and they're like no
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:41.180]  and it was the worst because I could literally write about it immediately, but I hadn't spent any time with it and
[02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:47.900]  Right, and I that's awful because you feel time pressure and yet you can't actually invest the time or you have to invest the time
[02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:50.680]  While everybody is shouting at you to get your story done
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:55.940]  So the luxury of having eight days to think about this product is great as a writer
[02:13:55.940 --> 02:13:59.660]  But it also means as Apple that you were you know
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:04.160]  These writers that you've hand selected are going to be writing about it
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:07.620]  you know, they're gonna have time to think about it and not they're not gonna do a
[02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:12.900]  A cheap job on it. They're gonna they're gonna like put a lot of effort into it
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:18.700]  All right, and it's not like within your case that the boss was breathing down your neck like you've got to publish it
[02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:25.680]  But you it's just the simple pressure that you know that Mac world's readers are coming to the site and that they're
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:27.320]  reloading the home page
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:29.720]  Like I can't wait to see what they have to say about 15
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.100]  You know 15 people got it and wrote their reviews and I wasn't in that group
[02:14:33.100 --> 02:14:38.580]  But now I'm in a group of a very small number of people who have the iPad before it's out
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:46.060]  And so I've got something that nobody except for that first wave of 10 people has has gotten their hands on
[02:14:46.100 --> 02:14:51.580]  So I need to do something with that. But what is that and I have no no restrictions whatsoever
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:54.020]  So literally I could just be like do to do to do here
[02:14:54.020 --> 02:15:00.740]  I am on my iPad like live update for two days and nobody wants to read that but you have to make very difficult
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:07.100]  Decisions then and it's certainly a lot easier to just say I've got eight days to worry about what I'm gonna write
[02:15:07.460 --> 02:15:12.980]  Yeah, it's hard enough to do a good review in eight days, but it's it's I I couldn't write a
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:17.980]  Review in the way that I try to write reviews in one or two days
[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:22.940]  I like I think back to the original iPhone where I you know, it was I didn't get anything
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:28.220]  I think only three or four that was back in the days when only the the newt the four newspaper guys got the review units
[02:15:28.220 --> 02:15:30.220]  Right. I think it was Steven Levy
[02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:36.260]  At big pogue and Mossberg, I guess Levy wasn't at a newspaper news week, but he was on the list
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:38.840]  He knew everybody from covering the iPod. Yeah
[02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:46.940]  Right, and it was still the sort of Steve Jobs is you know, if it's not print, it's not really real and Newsweek, right?
[02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:51.760]  I mean Steven Levy is you know, it he's a special case because he's
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:57.660]  Awesome and has been around for so long but but hey the last few years when I haven't had it in advance
[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.020]  I mean I've had I've made a little agreement with myself
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:05.900]  Like I I get the phone on the Friday or the Thursday night before the Friday sometimes
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.760]  But you know, I get it. I get it basically when people get it
[02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.900]  And you know, my reviews wouldn't run into like Tuesday or Wednesday. I would basically say I'm gonna take the weekend
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:16.620]  I'm gonna use it. I'm gonna write
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:22.180]  I'm gonna give it some time because there's no point all the reviews are that that were coming out the day of
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:27.560]  Already came out two days before so I can't beat them and I don't want to write a slapdash
[02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:32.140]  One day review. There's no point in that. So let me take my time and
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:39.060]  The people who care about getting the depth later will will care because I've already missed the weekend
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:42.120]  And so I'm and I'm not gonna write a crappy review
[02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:47.940]  Yeah, I remember it's like so the first iPhone, you know, I certainly didn't have anything in advance
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:53.860]  I just got in line literally waited in line with everybody all day long at the King of Prussia Mall here in Philly and
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:02.400]  Got home at night had terrible problems activating it it felt like I was ready to die
[02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:08.940]  And then just banged out my initial thoughts, you know, like, you know, wow
[02:17:08.940 --> 02:17:12.000]  That's I can't believe they're using comic sans in the notes app, you know
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.380]  I mean I was excited and I think I had some interesting first observations
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:19.420]  But it was more or less like I was publishing my notes. It wasn't that I was writing an article. I
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:26.100]  Just published my notes because I couldn't like I had to write something. I felt not just because I was so excited
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:26.900]  That's actually nothing
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:31.380]  That's actually a really good technique and sometimes I do that too where it's like let me give you my notes of like first
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:35.900]  Impressions, but it's not my review. I'm I still need to think about it. But here's some stuff
[02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:39.260]  I noticed and then you move away I guess yeah, I guess what I'm trying to yeah
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:41.380]  It's one of those things where it's only used to me
[02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:47.500]  The only two interesting ways to do it is really really here's my notes and my first impressions or here's something
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.980]  I've taken at least a week to sort of
[02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:52.860]  Let it permeate totally
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:57.820]  What do you think of the event venue moving to?
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.980]  De Anza College, whatever the Flint Center Center. I've never been there. I've never been there ever been there
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:07.440]  I didn't go to the iMac event when they held it there when they introduced the first iMac
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:13.800]  Yeah, I was all before my time as you know before you've daring fireball was even existed
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:16.720]  and it's mysterious big
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:21.440]  Mystery box out front. Nobody even knows what it is. Nobody even knows if it's a building
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:25.440]  I mean some people think it's like it like just scaffolding to cover what's under yeah
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:32.160]  I I think this is I mean people love the Apple Kremlin ology, you know, everybody loves that but I don't know
[02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.400]  I I think one reason is that finding event venues is hard
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:40.560]  in the conference center stuff tends to get booked
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:42.960]  sometimes years in advance
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:49.200]  So they may have looked for a good Moscone West time and just not found one or and Yerba Buena theaters too small
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.480]  I think they want they really wanted to invite a larger crowd
[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:55.960]  We've there have been some reports about like some fashion industry people invited to it's like at some point
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:58.060]  They're gonna run out of space for the for the press
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:19:03.400]  if and if they can't get Moscone West the number of venues in the Bay Area that can that can fit that are
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:05.400]  limited
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:11.320]  And then I also know from talking to people at Apple that they've always you know
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.680]  They're based in Cupertino it anytime you do an event in San Francisco
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.680]  There's a lot of overhead in
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.840]  People coming up to the city and you got to get hotel rooms and they're in the city for days at the venue before hand
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:27.680]  Right because their hours their hours their pre-event hours are so crazy. They can't afford the back and forth
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:33.200]  Yeah, cuz it's Lee. What is about an hour? It's about an hour from if you get catch traffic. Well, yeah
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.760]  Yeah, but I mean, yeah, unless you're going through like exactly at the commute. It's the hour ish between them
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.000]  So you're not shuttling back up and down especially since a lot of times the the night before the event. They're they're late
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:44.680]  Locking it all down
[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:52.060]  And so you've got all of your people who are setting up the venue and are gonna be participating are off-site
[02:19:52.680 --> 02:20:00.120]  far away and that's you know, it's something that they they do with WWDC for instance and any other event they do up in
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:01.920]  the city but definitely
[02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:08.560]  It's an added bit of a pain that I think they would rather not do and I'm pretty sure that they're constructing an event space
[02:20:08.560 --> 02:20:13.880]  In the new campus that will allow them to just do the events on campus because town hall is too small, too
[02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:15.920]  so I think yeah, I think it was close and
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:18.440]  it's big and
[02:20:18.440 --> 02:20:24.720]  Then the structure my guess is like literally it was close and big but it didn't have room for hands-on area
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:27.520]  Briefing rooms something like that and they're like, you know what?
[02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:31.000]  It's better for us to rent this and build a temporary structure than it is to go somewhere else
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.360]  So let's just do it
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:37.240]  Well, cuz remember the one two years ago that was in San Jose, California theater, right?
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:40.440]  Two events there because they did the u2
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.320]  color iPod
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:47.220]  Yeah, I know I I wasn't going to events at that time. So I missed that one
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:54.160]  That was a beautiful theater, California theater in San Jose is beautiful hands-on area was totally a nightmare
[02:20:55.160 --> 02:21:00.080]  Exactly. That's exactly where I was going. The hands-on area was like going up into your parents attic
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:06.680]  Well, imagine just hundreds of people in a space that was like barely big enough for you to go buy some jujubes at the counter
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:12.240]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was. It was like here's where they're usually just selling popcorn and you know, yeah
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:15.580]  It didn't it didn't it was it was a nice venue
[02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:20.720]  but there was Apple always likes to have one hands-on area so that the press can
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:26.320]  Get their hands on the stuff and take pictures with Tim Cook coming out and looking at the new stuff
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:31.920]  And then they also like to have briefing areas where they can meet with a press and that's where you you know
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:34.040]  If you're getting an advanced unit, that's where you'll pick it up
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.160]  and
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:41.880]  You know, that's a big checklist of items and I think there's very few venues like Moscone West will do it
[02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:49.320]  But my guess is that Moscone West wasn't available or I don't think have they ever just had a pure product introduction at Moscone
[02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:51.520]  I can't recall my time
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:55.960]  I think they have I think they have done it where they've literally just taken it for the day
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:02.640]  But but it's a big conference space and they're never gonna County. So it's very difficult to get space and something like that, right?
[02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:09.480]  So yeah, I think it's I think that that's what I think it's I'm gonna go with a nice simple Occam's razor
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:15.760]  Explanation that they picked the venue because it has a lot of seats and they do want to invite more people
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:21.720]  I mean they could they could have taken it to like where the San Jose Sharks players like a giant arena of Apple
[02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:27.360]  No, see, but they could in theory they could but I think they wouldn't because they wouldn't like the the no
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:32.280]  No, it's totally true. But that's the difficulty in finding a venue. That's like the right size for them
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:40.440]  That's like conference space and not sporting arena. And and then I think the big white box is a big white
[02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:42.520]  temporary
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:46.840]  Hands-on area because if they've invited more people there's gonna be a lot more
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:51.600]  You know need for a big one and the last time I tried it in the theater with a tiny little thing
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:53.640]  It was actually a very unpleasant hands-on
[02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.980]  I just that's I don't think there's any so many people that can get into the Flint Center, too
[02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:00.840]  So it makes it even worse that like now you've got this big venue
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:01.320]  Okay
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.320]  But now you really need a big hands-on area or you're gonna have members of the press waiting for hours
[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:13.040]  To get through the doors by the you know get admitted by the fire marshal to get into a space, right?
[02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:17.920]  And so you've got a you know, the math works as soon as the venue gets bigger the hands-on area has to get bigger
[02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:18.560]  like town hall
[02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:23.080]  they use the little piano lounge across the way and that's a tight fit because
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:27.700]  Yeah town hall is small. The piano lounge is also small and it doesn't fit
[02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:33.920]  Yeah, that's not that pleasant either just in term and that's you know with the overflow crowd, you know
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:39.880]  You know take however many people and fit in town hall. They maybe invite two more. Yeah, and
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:44.640]  And that's it's just already channel call. Yeah, so I think that's what it is
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:48.000]  I think it's a hands-on area and maybe they also have some like temporary
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:50.960]  Briefing rooms or something in there. Yeah
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:58.480]  Yeah, probably and and maybe they have some stuff to demo that does take more physical space home kit
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:00.400]  stuff carplay, you know
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:05.760]  Car play and you know and that all fits in I don't think it's super mysterious though
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:11.720]  You know, I don't I don't think that they've built like a full-scale home, you know, so I've seen people speculating that
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:17.360]  I mean, that's crazy. I they don't need to do that. They did maybe they have some couches and whatever, you know
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.200]  It I agree with you. I think there's the Occam's razor
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:28.360]  Explanation is the best which is this was a venue they could get and the one thing it didn't have was space for
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:34.040]  Hands-on stuff so, you know and when you're playing with in Apple's League
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:39.920]  and you're shopping around for venues you look at the cost of setting up a temporary structure for a week and
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.320]  Pencil it in and maybe that's actually as ridiculous as it seems. Maybe that's the best deal
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:48.680]  Yeah, that's exactly what I think exactly now
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.240]  Now we'll embarrass ourselves
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:53.520]  Yeah, people are listening back
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:57.920]  They didn't realize they built an entire house under there and it was full of wearable devices, right?
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:01.960]  But I can't wait I can't wait because the next time I'm going to see you in two days
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:04.800]  Let you know less than two days. I will see you
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:12.040]  I will almost always run into you in the morning outside the event venue and and if they've uncovered it and it's something else
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:17.160]  We could just look at each other. We won't even need to talk. They'll just hide our heads and change. Yep, exactly, right
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.540]  We'll utter a silent apology to talk show listeners and right
[02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:25.200]  I'll have to have you right back on as the next episodes guests so that we
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:28.440]  Apologize, right? What went wrong? Yep
[02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:34.960]  Jason self, thank you so much for your time. Thanks for having me. I it was a lot of fun. It's great to be on
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.040]  God, you know, I just I your voice is like butter on a podcast a
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:46.920]  Podcast that needs butter. Hopefully well, you know, you know you do a lot of pod. I do you I may have a problem
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:53.680]  You and Renee you guys get a lot of podcasts and plus you've got overcast in your dock
[02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:55.680]  So you're listening to a lot of puns. Yes
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:00.760]  But I hear your voice in my headphones a lot and I usually don't get to talk back to it and it's it's
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:25.880]  And I usually don't get to talk back to it. And it's it's it's been a pleasure. Likewise. I'll see you Tuesday morning. I'll see you Tuesday
