[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Hello there. Hello.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  How was the Yankee game?
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  It was
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  Emotional and then it was extraordinarily disappointing.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  And because I was at the Yankee game today,
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.000]  I'm probably going to sound like I've taken a chainsmoking.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  Well, you know, they can set up the special events,
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.000]  but they can't usually can't fix the outcome.
[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  No, you know,
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  I'm not going to go all baseball.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  We've got tons and tons of nerd stuff to talk about,
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  but you know it was bad that I don't even know why I haven't,
[00:40.000 --> 00:42.000]  because it's funny when you go to a game sometimes you don't,
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  you know, like the cell phone reception's bad,
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.000]  because there's 48,000 people all trying to use the same network.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  So I didn't follow the Twitter.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  I didn't follow any of the Yankee beatwriters.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  I don't know what the explanation is, but
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  the Yankees designated hitter today was Stephen Drew,
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  who's hitting 160 and has five home runs on the ceiling.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  They like picked them out of like off waivers like three weeks ago.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  And they never pinch it for me.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  They got to the end of the game.
[01:11.000 --> 01:12.000]  They had a man on first.
[01:12.000 --> 01:14.000]  They're down by two and Drew is up again.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  And there's nobody on the bench.
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  And this is after the roster expansion.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  That's how that's how bad the Yankees have done.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  That reminds me as a fan of an Ashley team.
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  This happens a lot when national league teams.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  Again, yes, we're talking about baseball.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  When the Ashley teams try to play in the American League sometimes,
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  they're like, they're designated hitter is just some guy.
[01:35.000 --> 01:37.000]  So literally the fourth outfielder,
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  because they don't have a designated hitter.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  So they're like, I don't know, this guy.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.000]  But there's like designated,
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  a classic designated hitter is David Ortiz from the Red Sox.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  He's a great guy who's always going to try to knock the hide off the bond.
[01:52.000 --> 01:53.000]  Just hit it hard.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  And probably a good hitter, but at least also a power hitter.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  Right.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  But in theory, though, you could put anybody there,
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  like you could put each hero there.
[02:01.000 --> 02:02.000]  And he's not a power hitter.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  But if you had an, you know, you already had.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  I believe he's not your ninth best hitter.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.000]  Right.
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  It's like the one.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  It's just so bad.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  If the New York Yankees this year were the Minnesota Twins
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.000]  or the Cleveland Indians or name any other team from, you know,
[02:20.000 --> 02:21.000]  some are in the middle of the country.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  No offense to those teams.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  I'm just saying a team that's not a perennial powerhouse.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  And they had this record and they had this lineup
[02:28.000 --> 02:29.000]  and these starting pitchers.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  And nobody would be paying any attention to them all.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  It would be a curiosity that they're theoretically still in the wildcard race.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  But nobody would even know.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  There wouldn't be like nightly updates on ESPN about where they are in the wildcard race.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  It's just because of the Yankees.
[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  And because there's one particular guy on the roster named Derek Jeter.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.000]  Right.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Which was, I mean, that's kind of the point of, of, of today.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  So, you know, but it's true.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  They're, they're not, they're one of those teams.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  I noticed that the Padres are like six games out or something in the wildcard.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  And it's like the technically in it still kind of category.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  People aren't really paying attention.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  But there's something magical could happen, but probably won't, but could.
[03:09.000 --> 03:12.000]  Yeah. Yeah, probably not.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  I'm a little worried.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  I got a little worried by the end of the game that it's because I think they're five games over 500.
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  And I actually think that that's a remarkable achievement given what's happened to them.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  They've had four out of their five starting pitchers on opening day.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  Had like season ending injuries or almost season ending injuries.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  Pineda was out, I don't know, four months.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  Well, it's remarkable that the team with four out of their five starting pictures having season ending
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  would possibly career ending in the case of CC Sibathia injuries is five games over 500.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  That's remarkable.
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  But here's the thing I, the takeaway I came from today where I was, I left the Yankee Stadium very depressed.
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.000]  And my thought is, everybody's hoping that Jeter at least gets to finish the season, maybe chasing down a wildcard.
[03:54.000 --> 04:01.000]  My fear is that he's going to finish the season chasing down the first ever losing season that he's had as a Yankee.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  It could happen, but they, you know, that again, they could be, you know, sometimes again, it depends on what your expectations are.
[04:08.000 --> 04:16.000]  I remember that there was a period in the early 2000s when the Giants were, I think they played like five or six years
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  where they had like three games where they were eliminated.
[04:19.000 --> 04:26.000]  And most of those years, you know, the Giants have, I think, never won the division two years in a row, ever.
[04:26.000 --> 04:32.000]  But there was something good about that that they, they would get eliminated the last week of the season.
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  And even if they didn't win the division of the wildcard, they, they weren't playing meaningless games to late September.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  And I realized that's in some ways a low bar, but I do kind of like that.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  The idea that you're always around and maybe some years you fall short and your five games out or whatever at the end.
[04:48.000 --> 04:59.000]  But, you know, when, when that all sort of fell apart and there were a couple of years there where they were out in like the end of August, it felt really strange because that's the thing you get used to is, you know, at least we're in it.
[04:59.000 --> 05:05.000]  We might not make it, but we're in it till almost it's the end of the, you know, it's the football season.
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.000]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  Yeah.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  I actually, that was actually one of the reasons I think as a boy that I became a Dallas Cowboys fan.
[05:11.000 --> 05:23.000]  And one of my favorite things about my, the Tom Landry era Dallas Cowboys was that I believe the number is 20 that they had 20 consecutive winning seasons where they won at least nine out of the 16 games.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  Right.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  And during that era, clearly the dominant team of that era was the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[05:28.000 --> 05:38.000]  The Steelers, I don't think, you know, the, the Cowboys I think took one from the Steelers, but the Steelers beat the Cowboys more than the, the, you know, the other way around and they won four in a row.
[05:38.000 --> 05:52.000]  And, you know, you, you could argue then that afterwards that the 49ers supplanted the Cowboys, the, the Joe Montana era 49ers and literally in one game, you know, there was like a passing of the torch with the catch.
[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  But the thing about that, that 20 consecutive winning seasons to me is that's, that's an incredible thing.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  You know, that's like an amazing consistency.
[06:01.000 --> 06:08.000]  And I think with Jeter, I, and again, I'm just talking off the cuff here, but I believe, and at one point I know it was true.
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.000]  Don't count last year because he only played 17 years because of the ankle.
[06:11.000 --> 06:17.000]  But in all the, all the seasons he said, full seasons with the Yankees, he's, he's only played one meaningless game.
[06:17.000 --> 06:24.000]  One time the last, and it was the last ever game at Yankee Stadium, the old Yankee Stadium.
[06:24.000 --> 06:25.000]  So it wasn't even meaningless.
[06:25.000 --> 06:32.000]  It was that that was the one game where they were now they're technically out of the playoffs, but it was the last game at the house that Ruth felt.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  So you could argue that it wasn't meaningless.
[06:34.000 --> 06:43.000]  It was actually very emotional and Jeter gave a speech to a completely sold out, completely, you know, emotional crowd.
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  That's the magic of, yeah, I think there's, I think there's something we said for being in it.
[06:49.000 --> 07:02.000]  And, and like I said, that was a great era for the Giants when they, when you could count on, on maybe one hand, the number of meaningless games that they played over, of course, like four or five years.
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  And they didn't win.
[07:03.000 --> 07:06.000]  Actually, you know, they got to the World Series one of those years and the rest of them.
[07:06.000 --> 07:08.000]  I think they, they went to playoffs once and the rest of them.
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  They didn't even make the playoffs, but it was that thing of like you weren't playing out the string.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  You were, you were, the games were meaningful and even if you ended up on the wrong side of them, they were meaningful.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  And that, I know that sounds strange for, especially if you're like, well, a championship is the only thing that'll, that'll do.
[07:21.000 --> 07:30.000]  But there is something to going to a game and saying, hey, maybe something magical could happen here versus like literally these are two teams that are going nowhere and don't care anymore.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Yeah.
[07:31.000 --> 07:32.000]  That's the worst.
[07:32.000 --> 07:33.000]  It's just absolute.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's the Astros playing the Padres and, yeah.
[07:36.000 --> 07:43.000]  But it's, you know, that's baseball, you know, and that's, that's, you know, it's a sport where, and, you know, we can get into complaints about the wild card and everything.
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.000]  But it's still, even with the wild card and even with the expansion of the wild card, it's still a sport we're just making it to the postseason special.
[07:49.000 --> 07:56.000]  I can't, I can't, I can't fathom the sports like the NBA where it's almost hard not to make the playoffs.
[07:56.000 --> 08:01.000]  Yeah, where it's just about seating and like clearing out the absolute drags.
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  Right.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  And then you all play, you know, then, then you're in a tournament.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  You might as well, there's that one year where I think the NHL came back from a strike and they literally just did a tournament.
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  Yeah, I do remember that.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  It's like we give up.
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  Who needs a season?
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Oh, anyway, busy weekend.
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  It's gonna be huge.
[08:19.000 --> 08:21.000]  I don't even know where to start.
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  I think it's, so we're recording Sunday night.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  We're going to error this tomorrow.
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  People will be listening on Monday.
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  I think this is probably one of those episodes where people won't, won't wait around.
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  If you did, and you waited around, then you're listening to it after the fact.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  But those of you listening on Monday, the end of September 2014.
[08:41.000 --> 08:51.000]  We're talking the prelude to Apple's big, well, we don't know what event, but we can make some pretty good guesses.
[08:51.000 --> 09:01.000]  It's gone for everybody thought it was going to be an iPhone event and maybe something else to it's quickly zeroed into iPhones and,
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  quote unquote, a wearable.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.000]  Right.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  Which is funny, because this is the event we always think of as the iPhone event.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  And the iPhone is Apple's biggest product.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  And this is by any measure.
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  And I can only look at, like, I know what the mackerel traffic is like for the last few years.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  And people talk about, oh, Apple events are big.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  The iPhone event is of a scale.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  In terms of just general interest on the web, that is beyond any other Apple event of the year.
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  The iPhone event always pins the needle in a way that an iPad event or a WWDC keynote,
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  just doesn't.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And so it's fascinating that everybody's suddenly, like, talking about the wearable thing,
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  because without it, this would still be the biggest Apple event of the year.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  Yes, that's absolutely true.
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.000]  And I think what's weird about that, I was just talking offline with Dave off the show,
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  not on the show, but with my friend Dave Whiskis about this over the weekend.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  And we were talking about with this, the rumors that there's going to be a wearable announcement.
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  Call it the watch or whatever kind of thing it is.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.000]  It doesn't really matter.
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  But the rumor is that they're going to announce it.
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  And then it won't, it may not ship right away.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  It may not even ship in calendar 2014.
[10:18.000 --> 10:21.000]  It might just be for whatever reason.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  And we got to speculating, well, why would they pre-announced something if it wasn't ready to go on sale yet.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  And in 2007, when the only time they really, I can remember them ever doing that,
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  like a significant lead time, was with the original iPhone.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.000]  Yeah.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  Yeah.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  Yeah.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  Whether that was the Macworld Expo in January and it didn't ship to July.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  Or was it June 27th?
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  It was summer.
[10:45.000 --> 10:48.000]  It was, and it was late June, if it was June.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.000]  I think it was like June 28th.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  And to June.
[10:50.000 --> 10:51.000]  Right.
[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  This is why we need a chat room.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Because of course, there's somebody out there who is, you know, going.
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  I remember that because my family and I were going to summer camp and we'd made the reservations like a year in advance.
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  And I got the iPhone the day we were supposed to leave for summer camp.
[11:03.000 --> 11:05.000]  And so I reviewed the iPhone in a tent.
[11:05.000 --> 11:07.000]  I, you know what's funny?
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  I, I went with Amy and, and her, some of her family to the shore in.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  We are my family.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  My family, I always goes to Jersey Shore.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  This was Ocean City, Maryland, where I'd never even been before the next day.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  Like I had stayed up all night and wrote like a first thought.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  And then we went to the shore.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  And I was, I have to, I think I, I try to be a good, you know, vacationer.
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  You know, don't, don't stay, you know, attached to the internet and, you know, the stuff I usually do when I'm with my family.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  But with a brand new iPhone, it was, it was impossible.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  It was impossible to think of anything other than the iPhone that was in my hand.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I had a, we, and we had no cell service at the, at the camp.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  So I had to actually, I had to drive like 40 minutes down the mountain side to, to test like the phone part of it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  But, but it was definitely summer.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.000]  It was one of those things that like Apple was ruining every, every buddy's summer vacation because that was late June and yeah.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  Yeah. And if you were going to extend like a weekend trip to like the 4th of July, it was right smack dab there.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  Yeah, but that's six months, six full months between.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  I remember your review.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  When you say you had no cell service, you don't mean like, it was like one bar, whatever.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  It was like, no surface.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  You know, the little thing that says no surface.
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  Right. Didn't even have the AT&T look.
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.000]  No, no, it was a complete, complete empty void.
[12:27.000 --> 12:38.000]  And so yeah, I went down the mountain about 25 minutes and sat pulled over by the side of the road basically when I had like a bar and made a couple of calls and did some data.
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  Just, it was ridiculous.
[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  But that was, that was how I can always remember that it was summer vacation right around the end of June, beginning of July.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  And, and that was despite the fact that the event was Mack World Expo.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  So that was early January.
[12:49.000 --> 12:50.000]  So there's a huge process.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  But that allowed them to keep it secret, right?
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  Which I think is the scenario here with this wearable is that we all know.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  I mean, not to get into more anecdotes, but like, I remember you went to New York.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  I was, since I'm in California, I went to Cupertino, but they did those briefings for mountain lion.
[13:05.000 --> 13:06.000]  Yes.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  And everybody walked into those briefings and basically was like, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  Because there have been no rumors about it that there was going to be a new version of OS 10 that soon.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  And I remember running into MGC glare afterward.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  And we looked at each other in both kind of mouth.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  Oh my God, right?
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  And that's because, you know, Cupertino is pretty locked down.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And so the iPhone was pretty locked down because it wasn't in the supply chain yet.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  And so many of these leaks like about the iPhone 6 come from the supply chain.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  And this wearable isn't in the supply chain yet.
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  And people talk about FCC approvals, leaking things.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  And that may be true, but also like, if you announce it early enough, it's not outside Cupertino.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  And maybe, you know, some theoretical parts are.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  But the whole product is not in production.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  And that means they can make that splash.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  You can only do that once.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.000]  Right.
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  Yeah, that's exactly the point that I was making over the weekend.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.000]  And privately is that Steve Jobs, and this is what was thrown in my face was,
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  well, Steve Jobs said in 2007 that the reason they were pre announcing the iPhone was FCC.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  They didn't want to have it come out through FCC regulations.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  They're going to announce it now.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  They're going to put it through the regulatory process.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  They're going to put it through the carrier testing process with singular.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  And that would spoil the secret.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  And they wanted to show it to us now.
[14:24.000 --> 14:25.000]  And it's not quite finished.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  Software wise, but we'll be ready in six months.
[14:29.000 --> 14:35.000]  And that that wouldn't apply to a wearable because a wearable wouldn't need to get all the same regulatory stuff that a cell phone was.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  Which I don't know is true actually.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  I think maybe it does if it has, I don't know what the regulations are.
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  I think it's got radios in it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  It has to get some sort of process.
[14:44.000 --> 14:51.000]  Yeah, if it has, you know, this NFC or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or it has to have some kind of connectivity presumably.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  But I think it's more than that though.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  See, here's, I think there's a huge difference between 2014 and 2007,
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  which is in 2007.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  As big a deal as Steve Jobs' keynotes were to guys like me and you,
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  people who listen to this show, people who read Mac world and they're in fireball.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  Right.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  We still hung on keynotes, right?
[15:10.000 --> 15:17.000]  We got up and gotten line to get in the keynotes at WWDC or we'd, you know, listen to the live feed and stuff like that.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  Yeah.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  But it was not that many people compared to today.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  And there was no, even all of the speculation,
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  and there were so many rumor sites, there were tons, always have been Apple rumor sites.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  And Apple rumor sites have always been trying to, you know, get the goods on upcoming stuff.
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  But there was nothing like the market of speculation for, for new iPhones and this pressure.
[15:39.000 --> 15:46.000]  And I think it's, you know, it's clearly financial pressure that there's money exchanging hands to get these
[15:46.000 --> 15:53.000]  prototypes and mockups and shell casings and screens and home screen buttons.
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  And, you know, everything has leaked.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  I'm not saying that we know everything that the phone's going to do,
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  but at least the parts have all leaked.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  I mean, there'll be updates somebody will find literally like,
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  here's the volume buttons of the new iPhone.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  Yeah.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  And, you know, in the last couple of years,
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  the first couple of years when that started happening, everybody was like,
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  ah, it's got to be fake, fake, fake.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  And it ends up, it's like, yeah, that, you know, that was actually right.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Well, the supply chain just, I mean,
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  I think the economics of, of the people working in the supply chain,
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  which is almost entirely in Asia, almost entirely in China.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  You know, there are so many people involved and, you know,
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  culturally, it doesn't take that much for somebody who's not being paid very much
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.000]  to get paid a bribe basically to slide one of the 15 samples they've got to somebody else.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  And I think that's how business gets done.
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  I mean, I really, I'm trying not to judge this because I think by their,
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  their cultural standards, it's not that big a deal that's sort of how business gets done.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  And how competition happens.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  But from Apple's perspective, it's, you know, antithetical to what they want to do.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Right. And so they have to do.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  And they can't do it now.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  They see they can't pre-enounce the iPhone.
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.000]  Let's just say, I've been avoiding the term, the iPhone 6 because I don't know what Apple's going to call it.
[17:08.000 --> 17:14.000]  And I, you know, that they, I certainly didn't predict that they would stop numbering iPads, right?
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  They said iPad, iPad 2, and then they just went back to iPad.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  Right. New iPad.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  And then iPad Air and iPad Mini.
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.000]  So I'm, you know, they've stuck with this numbering and then stick an S after the number system for a while,
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.000]  but I am not making any predictions as to name.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  But I'll just say iPhone 6 as short hand.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  Yeah, short hand.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  They couldn't, they can't announce the iPhone 6, 6 months in advance to avoid these supply chain links,
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  be leaks because they have to avoid the Osborne effect.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  Exactly.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  Even the iPad was a two month window between announced and ship.
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  It's same deal because they weren't cannibalizing some other product when they did it,
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  but now that once that product starts, once the clock starts ticking,
[17:58.000 --> 18:04.000]  then you've got a, you got to ship it fast because nobody's buying it between the day you announce and the day you ship it.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  Right. Because so, for example, and I'm sure I've spoken to Apple store employees
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  and people who've worked at Apple stores, you know, have written to me during a firewall,
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  that people come in all the time and they're like, Hey, I hear there's a new iPhone coming out.
[18:17.000 --> 18:18.000]  It's going to be bigger. What do you get?
[18:18.000 --> 18:21.000]  And they can honestly say, we don't know anything about it.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  They don't tell us stuff like that. We don't know.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  Here's the iPhones we have today. I can tell you all about them.
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.000]  If they pre announce it in June and then somebody comes in in July and says,
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  I hear there's going to be a big iPhone coming out.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  I'd like, that sounds interesting to me. To be honest, they would have to say,
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  yeah, you're right. It's, you know, we've pre announced that it's coming in September.
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  I'll lay away plan for you. Yeah. We'll see you then.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  And they can't do that. You know, so I think, and as big as the iPod was,
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.000]  and I often win a money's podcast, I often start mixing up my iPod's and pads,
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  but the iPod, really, the music player.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  As big as it was and as much as it kind of made Apple,
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  the household company outside the Mac community, you know,
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  that it became a decade ago, you know,
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.000]  we all used to make jokes when Apple first started opening retail stores,
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  and you'd be walking through the mall and you'd hear a kid say,
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  mom, I want to go to the iPod store. Right.
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.000]  I mean, I heard that several times from, you know, not from the same kid.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  The iPod was nothing like the iPhone.
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.000]  I, there was no, no market like this for,
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  oh my God, here's the pre release, you know, screen of the new iPod,
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  or the, here's the, here's the new circle rocker.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  What do we call that? What was that thing called?
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  The click wheel? Yeah, the click wheel.
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  Yeah, you know, the people, even people who think they follow this stuff,
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  don't always understand the scale of the iPhone that like,
[19:55.000 --> 19:59.000]  I think, okay, this is going to be wrong, but like I think your,
[19:59.000 --> 20:05.000]  your run of the mill brand new iPhone model probably sells more than the entire iPod line has ever sold.
[20:05.000 --> 20:07.000]  Probably in just a couple of months. I mean,
[20:07.000 --> 20:10.000]  the scale is, it's not even the same number scale.
[20:10.000 --> 20:17.000]  The iPhone is so much more popular a product than even the iPod was in its heyday.
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  Yeah, it's just unfathomable and this pressure is to, and you know, like from that,
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  I think it's largely from, it's not from the,
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  I think, I don't think it's from the rumor sites,
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  the people who publish these leaks.
[20:33.000 --> 20:40.000]  I don't think that the money that they get from the page views that come in from the reports
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  comes close to covering the sort of,
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  I know it's like you, I don't want to pass judgment,
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  but effectively the bribery that's going on and theft in some cases.
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.000]  It's the, I think it's the case makers.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  Yeah.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  Because there, there's so much pressure to get your case to market and Apple
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.000]  isn't going to tell them the measurements of the new phone until it's out.
[21:05.000 --> 21:09.000]  And yeah, and I get, I mean, we see,
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  there are cases like for the new iPhone that are being,
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  I get PR sometimes from people who say,
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  we've got the new iPhone case weeks before the new iPhone has even been announced because they're confident.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  And in that business, I think there's this feeling like,
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  if I can make 5,000 silicone cases based on these dimensions that I think are accurate,
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  and I can ship them into the channel in advance,
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  then the data that phone drops will be there.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  And if, and somebody's going to be there and it better be us,
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  because if we wait to make sure it's right,
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  somebody is going to beat us to the punch.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  And so they're motivated to get it right,
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  and I'm sure there are times when they don't get it right,
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.000]  if they gamble because if their intel is right,
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.000]  and the mold that they've made based entirely on parts and hearsay and whatever,
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  if it fits, then they can immediately ship it to the channel and sell those
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  and strike while the iron is hot.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  And so they're motivated to do it.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  And, you know, at the other one,
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  I linked them up last week.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.000]  I think their name is Feld and Vos.
[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  The heck is it? It's this, I think they're Russian.
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  Feld and Voc, V-O-L-K.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  Go to Feldvoc.com, F-E-L-D-V-O-L-K.com,
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  and they don't make cases.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  What they do is they take iPhone 5-S's, I guess, new ones,
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.000]  anodize the aluminum to new colors.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  They cut the back and put in like actual,
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  not like a wood case.
[22:38.000 --> 22:41.000]  They actually put like a wood panel in the back,
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  or, you know, like a flower pattern.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  And they take out the volume buttons and replace them
[22:46.000 --> 22:51.000]  with 18-karat gold volume and silence rocker buttons.
[22:51.000 --> 22:57.000]  And sell them, resell them for like $9,000.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I heard from people, and I'd never heard of them before.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  I mean, it just seems crazy.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  But apparently it's a big thing like in Moscow,
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  like all the oligarchs are into these things
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  that it's like a culture, you know, where these crazy billionaire
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  Russians want people to know they have $10,000 iPhones.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  But isn't that better than that crazy luxury?
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  I can't even remember the name of it, but you know,
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  virtue.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  Virtue, right.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  I mean, this is like a competitor to that,
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  where it's like it's a real iPhone, but we've actually
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  taken the parts.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  But again, there's that, you've got then you really want
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  to know what the shape of the parts are in advance.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  So you can start working on it.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  Right. And they had a super high quality video.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  Sure.
[23:39.000 --> 23:40.000]  They made like a commercial.
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  Because their clients really want the new iPhone when it
[23:43.000 --> 23:44.000]  comes out, right?
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Exactly.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  Which is they've got to have their molds done in advance,
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  even though that's impossible.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Right.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  So right.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  Supply chain is a logical place to go.
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  I also think perhaps that there are competitors, you know,
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Apple's competitors want to know what they're doing.
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.000]  And so they're paying.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.000]  Yeah.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  But all of the stuff then eventually it just sort of leaks around
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.000]  the edges.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  And you end up with these YouTube videos that are like
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  somebody speaking not in English, posted on a YouTube site,
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.000]  or even like on Chinese social network.
[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  There was an iPhone 6 video on one of the Chinese social
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  networks that got reposted to YouTube.
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  And, you know, yeah, it's not Mac rumors
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  paying these people.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  It's not Mark German isn't paying these people.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  It's the people paying like who are much more closely
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  attached to the supply chain.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  And they just, they really, there's a business advantage
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  to knowing in advance.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  And it's crazy.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  It's, it's really kind of nutty.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  Yeah.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  It does.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  It does with iPhones with gold volume rockers.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  Yeah.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  Let me take a sponsor break on a comeback.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  But the point I want to come back to you, I want to tell you in
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  advance, because I often forget by the time I get to the
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  end of a sponsor break, though, is that most of them don't
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  turn on.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  But then all of a sudden, like in the last two days, we're starting
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  to see one, like you said, there's like apparently a fully
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  moving 4.7 inch one that actually turns on and runs iOS 8, which
[25:05.000 --> 25:06.000]  is crazy.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Right.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  But I'm going to tell you about our friends at igloo.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  Long time sponsors of the show.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  igloo is the intranet that you'll actually like.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And they have a super exciting release that's brand new.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  It's called unicorn.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  We've talked about their unicorn update on the show before.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  It has a ton of new features, but the best is integrated task
[25:31.000 --> 25:36.000]  management that will change how you stay on track with your work.
[25:36.000 --> 25:40.000]  igloo tasks can be assigned in different ways, depending on the
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  way on the work you're doing.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  One of the coolest ways to use tasks is creating them directly
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  on your content.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  So you're requesting updates on a graphic that somebody on your
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  team is working on, or a text correction in a Word document.
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  You create these tasks right on your content in the igloo interface.
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  And then when the designer goes to update the graphic and they go
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  through igloo to get to it, the task, what you want changed, is
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  right there on the same page.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  So when you're viewing content, even if it's a blog, if it's an
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  event, a forum topic, inside your igloo, the tasks are all
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  right there.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  So the stuff that you need to be done is right there attached to
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  whatever it is, wherever you go in the igloo system.
[26:23.000 --> 26:24.000]  So find out more.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  It's a great stuff.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  All the other stuff about igloo is all still true.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  All sorts of great templates to choose from.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  The fact that it runs, it's your private internet that you get to
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  run.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  The fact that you get to start for free, for up to 10 people, and
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  just use it.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Unlimited time.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  This is it.
[26:47.000 --> 26:54.000]  That's it.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  Great, great internet.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  And now they're really with this task stuff, really making it into a
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  project management system for your small teams and organizations.
[27:06.000 --> 27:09.000]  So my thanks to that.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  So in the past, we've seen these leaks come out.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  And then they always, I think there was one about a week or two ago
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  that at least turned on to the point where it showed the
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  connector iTunes.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  Right.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  Right.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  And it was funny because somebody then took like screenshots of
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  that and like kind of estimated the measurement of the graphic
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  because the graphic had like letterboxing at the top and bottom.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  And a rough estimation is that it was, it might be very, very close to
[27:41.000 --> 27:46.000]  the size that I predicted a few weeks ago, which I think makes
[27:46.000 --> 27:47.000]  sense.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  In other words, it's the same pixel perinches, the iPhone 5
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  and 5S, but just they just cut it to 4.7 inches.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  Right.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  But now there's ones coming out that are actually fully operational
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  Death Stars.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  Yeah.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  I mean, I don't know enough about the production cycle, but I
[28:03.000 --> 28:06.000]  would imagine very late in the game, they're producing, first off
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  they're producing like test units.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  You know, there was a story about how iPhone shipments were already
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  filling planes going from China to North America.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  So, you know, at some point they're making them.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  They haven't announced them yet, but they've got to get them here
[28:21.000 --> 28:24.000]  and they're and around the world assuming that they're going to
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  drop them in a lot of countries in a couple of weeks.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  They've got to start shipping them now.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  So once that, I mean, then the genie's completely out of the
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  bottle and it's got to be a lot easier to to plug something
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  off the production line.
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  And there's probably an earlier wave that are like the production
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  models to see if the process works and if the quality level is high
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  enough and those probably leak.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  So there's probably a life cycle and I never thought of it this way
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  of life cycle leaks where, you know, it starts with all the
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  suppliers and then the end it's the assembly and then it's
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  then it starts to be working models.
[28:56.000 --> 28:57.000]  Yeah.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  I think I think they must be making the real ones by now.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  Yeah.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  They've got to be given the volumes.
[29:02.000 --> 29:04.000]  I mean, we were talking about how huge the iPhone volume is.
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  How much demand there is on day one.
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  Right.
[29:07.000 --> 29:08.000]  Then they've got to be making it.
[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  And that's why when I saw that story about about how, you know,
[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  there are already lots of Apple shipments coming from China that it's
[29:15.000 --> 29:18.000]  got, you know, it's completely believable because they've
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  got, you know, let's assume that in less than two weeks they're
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  going to be on sale.
[29:22.000 --> 29:24.000]  They're going to want to fill the channel with as many as
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  they can possibly make.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  And so yeah, they're making them now.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  We don't even know what they are yet.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  Right.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  But they're making them and shipping them.
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.000]  The story I saw, I'm sure you saw the same one, is that they're
[29:34.000 --> 29:39.000]  actually at right now, they've consumed like a majority share of all
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  shipping capacity coming out of China.
[29:41.000 --> 29:42.000]  Right.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.000]  Right.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  The Apple Apple is literally like filling the channel and not,
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  it's not like its channel.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  It's like the shipping channel from China to the US on planes.
[29:51.000 --> 29:52.000]  It's crazy.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  Yeah.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  There's only so many planes.
[29:54.000 --> 29:55.000]  They're not going to, they can't.
[29:55.000 --> 29:58.000]  It's not the sort of thing that you can buy more.
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.000]  Right.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  And it wouldn't make sense for the shipping industry to have enough
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  planes to meet this particular demand.
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Right.
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  And then any other 47 weeks of the year, they're sitting a
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  nerd, you know, airplane hangers, that's, you know.
[30:14.000 --> 30:15.000]  Right.
[30:15.000 --> 30:18.000]  Also, I wonder sometimes about like a build order, because
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  sometimes you know you order an Apple's website and you can
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  actually see it get shipped to you, that you'd actually, if
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.000]  that's going to be an option, you want to ship these early,
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.000]  these are the ones that are going to retail.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  And that at some point if they turn on pre-orders, those
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.000]  would be shipping from China, let's say.
[30:34.000 --> 30:35.000]  Right.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  But you know, you now, now is the time to fill the, the channel
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  with the ones that are just in the standard, standard
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  configs or maybe they're all standard configs and they've
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  got every single one possible.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  But you know, they're, what they're doing is they're filling,
[30:48.000 --> 30:50.000]  they're filling warehouses, they're filling capacity.
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  And, and we know that Apple usually can sell every single
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  one that they've got.
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  Sometimes people are angriest when they can't get the model
[30:58.000 --> 30:59.000]  they want.
[30:59.000 --> 31:00.000]  So it makes sense.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  But it's mind boggling.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  Again, we talked about the scale of iPhones and how it's hard
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  to understand just how huge the iPhone is.
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  And I think this fits into wearable expectations and how I
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  think people expect more than, than it can possibly deliver
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.000]  because it's never going to be, I think, an iPhone.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  Like, the iPhone is enormous, so enormous that we could take
[31:19.000 --> 31:23.000]  every bit of shipping capacity from China to the US and Apple
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  is doing it.
[31:24.000 --> 31:24.000]  Right.
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  And I don't know that there's any product that they could make that
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.000]  would, that that there's no other product that I can imagine that
[31:31.000 --> 31:32.000]  that that would happen for.
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  No, there's no other product category.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  I mean, this is, this is, this is, there've been some really
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.000]  nice pieces written about this.
[31:38.000 --> 31:42.000]  But it's this idea that, you know, somebody actually said you
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  could write the disappointment story like six months ago about
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  the wearable, no matter what it is, because people are going
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  to say, if the expectation is that it's literally another
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  category like the iPhone, that's not going to happen because
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  there's no product category like the iPhone.
[31:57.000 --> 32:00.000]  The smartphones in general are enormous.
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.000]  This, this huge class, it's a, it's a shift in how the world
[32:04.000 --> 32:05.000]  uses technology.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  And, you know, and, and with Apple's product line, you can
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  see the iPhone is just dwarfs everything else they do.
[32:11.000 --> 32:12.000]  And that's not going to change.
[32:12.000 --> 32:15.000]  There's not going to be another category in the next year or
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  two that supplant it or match it even because it's, it's just
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  completely out of scale because there's such demand for, for
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  smartphones.
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.000]  Yeah.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  I, and I think it plays into, I haven't written it up, but I,
[32:28.000 --> 32:31.000]  maybe it will, but a lot of times I talk about it on the show
[32:31.000 --> 32:32.000]  and then I don't write it.
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  But I've been thinking for months now about, and I, for years
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  I've been bothered by the whole smartphone versus phone
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  distinction and that it's so misleading and that, you know,
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  there's a lot of people's percentage increase in smartphones.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  Versus like how many more they're selling you over year versus
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  their share of the smartphone market.
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  And they're very misleading things because the smartphone
[32:59.000 --> 33:03.000]  market is even though Apple's iPhone business has been growing
[33:03.000 --> 33:05.000]  steadily every single year.
[33:05.000 --> 33:09.000]  The smartphone market has grown even faster overall.
[33:09.000 --> 33:11.000]  And that's simply because all phones are turning into
[33:11.000 --> 33:15.000]  smartphones at a ridiculous rate because it's getting so
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  cheap to make something that would qualify as a smartphone.
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  Right.
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.000]  And it's really just this bizarre distinction to me.
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's like, it's like a distinction between phones with black
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  and white screens and color screens.
[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  Like my, you know, my first cell phone had a black and white
[33:32.000 --> 33:37.000]  screen and eventually even the cheap $15 candy bar
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  phones had color screens because eventually the color screen
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  was so cheap that, you know, that they could do that.
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  It didn't make sense to talk about somebody's share of the
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  color phone market.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  Even though for a while, those phones were more expensive and
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.000]  thus more profitable because, you know, for a year or two,
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  they were like an exotic crazy thing.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  Like, look, the crazy little Java game I play on my phone
[33:59.000 --> 34:00.000]  is in color now.
[34:00.000 --> 34:01.000]  Right.
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  What were those members of some of those games like the
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  quicks or whatever?
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  Oh, yeah.
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  I had one of those that was on like a Sony Ericsson where
[34:08.000 --> 34:09.000]  it was terrible.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  I had a, I had a bowling game that was like my go-to bowling
[34:13.000 --> 34:13.000]  game.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  I had a bowling game on my old Nokia.
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  You know, and, and Horace did you and others who were more
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  analysts, you know, more rigorous statistically than I am.
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  The number, the number guys.
[34:26.000 --> 34:27.000]  Right.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  Have explained it, you know, in painstaking detail that it's,
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  you know, it is interesting that, that the smartphone market,
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  the percentage of all phones sold that are smartphones is growing
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  faster than any one company's share of that market.
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.000]  But really, like to me, it's just, we should just start calling
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  them phones and that a phone is a thing that's a computer in
[34:48.000 --> 34:49.000]  your pocket.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  So my daughter, when my daughter went to middle school,
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  we got her a phone and it's a, and it's not a smartphone.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  And, and yet I think by the standards of maybe four or
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.000]  five years before that, if not less, it would have been
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.000]  considered like a super featured phone because it doesn't,
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  I think it doesn't have data, but it has a full blackberry
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  style texting keyboard.
[35:12.000 --> 35:13.000]  I mean, it's not just like numbers.
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  It's got a whole, you know, quality keyboard on it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  And it's got a color screen.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  And it's got, I think you can install, I think it might even
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  have some software you can set up or install.
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  And, and it's not a smartphone as we consider it, but it's
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  not that far off.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  And that was three years ago.
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  So I would imagine, and she's, you know, we're going to
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  end up putting her on our plan and giving her my old iPhone
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  five, I think.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  But, but you know, so when my son starts middle school next
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  year, I mean, at one point is that phone, at some point very
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  soon, it is just easier for all concerned.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  If that is, you know, if the, the foot cheap phone they
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  offer for kids is the cheapest Android phone that they've
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  got, rather than some weird, just having to maintain some
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  other platform of these dumb phones.
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.000]  At some point, they'll just give up, at least in, in, in
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  the US and, and some other, the, of the richer countries.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  And at that point, there won't be anything that is in the
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  smartphone.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.000]  Yeah.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  And it, so there's like two interesting things to fall
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  out of that.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  The first is that if you go back to 2007 and you think about
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.000]  the iPhone and the name iPhone, that it undersold the device
[36:23.000 --> 36:26.000]  vastly, because it really wasn't a phone.
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  It was a computer, an internet connected computer in your
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  pants.
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  And it was amazing.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.000]  And it happened to also work on the standard cell phone
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  network and make and place at phone calls and let you,
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  you know, for example, one of the key features of that
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  first one, huge part of the demo was visual voicemail.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Because, and, and what did that do?
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  It let you deal with your voicemail, the way modern graphical
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  computers deal with messages, right?
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.000]  And so at first calling it a phone or the phone or the iPhone
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  was really selling it short because it wasn't what we thought
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  of as a phone.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  It was, it really truly was what we think of what we then
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  thought of as a personal computer.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  Whereas now, low these seven years later, when we say
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.000]  phone, we mean, we don't mean a device that's just for phone
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  calls.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  We mean a computer, right?
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  Right.
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.000]  If you say, I let, if somebody says you get, you know, you
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  arrive at a restaurant, you've a group of friends and you,
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  you took an Uber and you get out.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  And somebody says, oh, I left my phone in the car.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  You know what they left in the car?
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.000]  They didn't leave a cell phone.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  They left like an iPhone or some an Android.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  Whatever it was, it has apps and stuff, you know?
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  Yep.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Nobody, when they say I left my phone in the car means they left
[37:43.000 --> 37:46.000]  a device that only makes phone calls and text messages.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  Well, and as land lines die, the whole concept of anything
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  else a phone could be just disappears.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  And, and phone is not perhaps the best term to use for these
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  devices, but I kind of feel like it's the one that it's, you know,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  one of those cases where the word evolves to mean something
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  completely different, but because it's supplanting the thing that
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  it, it took its name from and that's what we'll call it.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  And at some point, people are going to be like, this is weird.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  Why do we call it a phone?
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  And somebody's going to say, well, actually, let me tell you
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  this for the 20th century and the phone.
[38:15.000 --> 38:16.000]  And that's where it came from.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  People be like, wow, I don't even, you know, why, why would you do
[38:19.000 --> 38:20.000]  that?
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  And the answer is, well, it was a series of small steps.
[38:23.000 --> 38:26.000]  And at no point did somebody say this isn't a phone anymore because
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  we had to explain what it was to people who, who their entire
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  frame of reference was the concept of a phone.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  Because, you know, I mean, talking on the phone is like one of
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  the least interesting things that I do on my iPhone,
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  and least common.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  It's the least pleasant.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  It's the only thing.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  It's the only one.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  It's the only one.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  It's the only one.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  It's the only one.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  It's the only one.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's the only one.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  It's the only one.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's the only one.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  It's why is the phone app even in my dock on my iPhone?
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  I never have it.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  I have it out of my dock.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.000]  My dock.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Yeah, I took it out.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  My dock is messages, Vesper.
[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  There's an ad.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  Safari and tweetbot.
[39:00.000 --> 39:01.000]  That's honest though.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Vesper really is in my, in my dock.
[39:03.000 --> 39:07.000]  I have mail Safari, Twitterific, and overcast in my dock.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  Very close.
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  Vesper, Vesper's down there, but it's not in the dock.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  Yeah.
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  But yeah, I yanked the phone out because, because frankly, if
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  somebody calls me, I don't need to watch the app.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.000]  And if I call somebody, I know where it is, and I call
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  people so seldomly.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  But yeah, so I feel like the name is going to be phone now.
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  And I doubt it will ever change.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  We'll just call them phones.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  Right.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  But phone doesn't mean what it meant.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  It's the way language evolves.
[39:31.000 --> 39:37.000]  It evolves in ways that the, what computer is a terrible
[39:37.000 --> 39:38.000]  word too.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  Yeah.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.000]  Think about it.
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  Yeah, true.
[39:41.000 --> 39:42.000]  True.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  True.
[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  Very true.
[39:44.000 --> 39:49.000]  And like dictionaries is prescriptivism versus descriptivism.
[39:49.000 --> 39:50.000]  Right.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  Whereas should a dictionary presribe, here is how you should use
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  all of the words.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  Yeah.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Because here is what they mean.
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.000]  Or should it describe, here is what people mean when they use
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  these words.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  And in some cases, you know, maybe, you know, with italics,
[40:07.000 --> 40:12.000]  say this is an, this is informal, you know, or this is slang.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  But you're just describing the use of the words.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  And sometimes those informal uses of the words are used so
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  much that they become a new sense of the word.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  And I think that's where we are with phone where maybe for the
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  first couple of years calling the iPhone a phone would, in
[40:29.000 --> 40:33.000]  dictionary terms, be informal, you know, and people who knew what
[40:33.000 --> 40:34.000]  you were talking about would get it.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  But I think we're at the point now where it's like time to add
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  a new number to what does phone mean and, you know, a new
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  integer and like meaning number four.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  Right.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  Pocket computers that is connected to cellular networks and
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.000]  Wi-Fi and can install apps.
[40:53.000 --> 40:53.000]  Right.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  Because it's, it feels like the ship is sailed.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  We're not going to suddenly say, okay, everybody,
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  stop on January 1st.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  We're going to stop calling them phones.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  And we're going to call them, you know, communicators.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  Right.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  And the prescriptivist will fight it tooth and nail all the
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.000]  way down.
[41:09.000 --> 41:10.000]  Sure.
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  But it doesn't matter.
[41:11.000 --> 41:12.000]  That's the language is like water.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  It's like trying to stop running water with your hands.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  It's going to happen anyway.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  But the point of all the point of this, the whole reason this
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  inspired it is your point about how big the iPhone is in the
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  phone market is, is that the phone is the, and thinking of it as
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.000]  a phone.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  Not thinking of as a smartphone, but just going to phone,
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  meaning a cell phone is the only thing I can think of on the
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  planet, where almost everybody who could have one does or
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  will have one.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  Yes.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  You could argue that it will be the first piece of high
[41:45.000 --> 41:51.000]  technology that will be in the possession of, I don't know,
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  90% of the human beings on Earth.
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  Because you look at the way this technology is spreading in
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  parts of the world that are not traditionally high tech
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  societies, places that are poorer, like Africa as a really great
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  example, where we've already seen like wireless technology leap
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  over wired technology because you don't need the infrastructure
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  that you used to need.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  And the internet at some point will be their experience
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  with the internet will be in a phone screen, not on a computer,
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  but in a phone screen, because that is a device that is going to
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.000]  be cheap enough to reach them, going to be able to attach via
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  wireless network that is going to be available.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  And as a result, we'll be more transformative as a whole.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  I mean, we can think about how the internet's changed all of our
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  lives and computers and all of that.
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  But for like the average human being on planet Earth, the phone
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  is going to be the thing that is transformative because it's
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  going to reach way more people.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  Yeah.
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.000]  And I think it's really, I think it was on pace for that before
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  2007, but when it was just voice and texting.
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  Right. Then it was a phone.
[43:01.000 --> 43:02.000]  Not a phone phone.
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  And I think it was already on pace to, you know, if there's seven
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  billion people on the planet, and I don't know, I might be missing
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  the mark on how many people are very elderly or babies
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  or very, very, very truly, truly poor.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  But let's say five billion of them could have a cell phone.
[43:26.000 --> 43:29.000]  It's getting very close to the point where that's true.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  You know, where there's billions of cell phones in use,
[43:32.000 --> 43:33.000]  and everybody's going to have one.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  And everybody, because of the nature of the thing that you're
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  banging it around in your pocket, even if you take care of it,
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  you know, every couple of years you're going to get a new one.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  Right.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  It's not going to be like your, you know, like TV sets where
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  people buy TV sets and use them for 15, 20 years.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.000]  Right.
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.000]  Like maybe eventually, but they're way too long.
[43:54.000 --> 43:55.000]  Well, not now.
[43:55.000 --> 43:56.000]  Right.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  Not right now.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  Not in the year, you know, the world we live in wherever year,
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  there's a new iPhone, you know, so the size of this market is,
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  I truly wonder if it even really occurred to Apple, you know,
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  in 2005, 2006, and to run up to the iPhone.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  Just how big the potential is there.
[44:14.000 --> 44:15.000]  I don't know.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  I mean, on one level, I think they had the vision of how this
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  was a big deal and this was going to make a difference.
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.000]  But you'd have to really be, you'd have to buy in all the
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  way to really believe like this is the future.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  And I don't know.
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  I kind of feel like that was so far away at that point that
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  they couldn't really, you know, you could, you could maybe
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  dream it, but you couldn't really see it.
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  And now you can see it.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  But back then it was more like, imagine what would happen if
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  we could pack all this stuff in there.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  And then the world saw that and said, Oh, well, this is it.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  And now every device in this class follows their lead.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  And now the world is changing because that was a moment where
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  like you said, you know, sure, we could have said five
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  billion people are going to have phones.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  But what it would have meant was they can call somebody.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  And now it's they can be on the internet with that device.
[45:01.000 --> 45:02.000]  I still think it's interesting.
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  And I remember this this clearly is that in that initial
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.000]  keynote Steve Jobs, he gave goals for what they wanted.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  And he said, we would like, you know, with by a year from now,
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  we would like to have one percent of the phone market.
[45:15.000 --> 45:16.000]  Right.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  And it was, and that's what he said.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  He didn't say one percent of the smartphone market.
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.000]  He said one percent of the cell phone market.
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  And that's one area where I truly think that Apple and
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  Steve Jobs clearly got it because what was then called a
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  quote unquote smartphone was not the Apple had no interest
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  in that whatsoever.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  They saw that as it was just as much garbage as the plain
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  old non smart phones that came before it.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  You know, it wasn't worth thinking about it was worth thinking
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  about just plain phones because a phone is something everybody
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  will have and everybody only has one.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  Well, and so the real question is with with the wearable stuff.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  Is that what they're thinking?
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  Which I think I think is the right thing to think, which is not
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.000]  how do we get how do we address the smartwatch market?
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  Right.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  But thinking can you think of something bigger that is more
[46:09.000 --> 46:14.000]  addressable than than because you know, I have a pebble.
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  And I actually wear it most days.
[46:16.000 --> 46:17.000]  I think it's about that.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  I have seen you wearing your pebble.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  And I think it's fine.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  I like the notifications on my wrist because it means I can ignore
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  a lot of notifications that I would otherwise take on my phone.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  But you know, it feels like I used to have a palm trio, right?
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  And I think you might have had one too.
[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  It feels like that.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  It feels like a thing that's cool and interesting,
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  but it's a kind of a hack.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  And in hindsight is going to be seen as the thing that happened
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  before the real thing.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  I didn't have a trio.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  I had the handspring box.
[46:43.000 --> 46:44.000]  Well, the visor.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  So I was before it even had internet.
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  Right.
[46:48.000 --> 46:49.000]  But I was real into it.
[46:49.000 --> 46:50.000]  I did.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  I gave it like a full year where I was taking all my notes on it
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and syncing my stuff over.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  I forget how we see it.
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.000]  Fereal.
[46:59.000 --> 47:00.000]  Yeah.
[47:00.000 --> 47:01.000]  I think it was like a serial cable.
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  Yeah.
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  So I mean, the pebble feels like that to me.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  It feels like it reminds me of my trio where it's like,
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  cool at the time.
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  But I'm under no illusion that this is the end product of this
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  category because it's not.
[47:15.000 --> 47:16.000]  It's an early adopter.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  Let's experiment.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.000]  And it's exactly the kind of product that Apple would
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  never make because it's not really a product for regular people.
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  It's a product for people like me who want to try it out
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  and think about what this might mean.
[47:29.000 --> 47:32.000]  And it's cool new tech.
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  But it's just not good enough.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  And the trio is kind of like that.
[47:36.000 --> 47:37.000]  It's really good enough.
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  It was a weird.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  It was a PDA attached to a cell phone.
[47:40.000 --> 47:41.000]  Yeah.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  And it was not good enough.
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.000]  You know, but it was ahead of its time.
[47:43.000 --> 47:44.000]  It was a way.
[47:44.000 --> 47:45.000]  Oh, definitely.
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.000]  It was the cutting edge.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  It was just a happen first.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  Right.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  Somebody had to think of it first before you could get there.
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.000]  Yeah.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  Exactly.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  Well, let's take a break.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  Let me take a break.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  And we'll come back to that question of how big and where I
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  think the wearable thing is going.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  But let me tell you about our second sponsor.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  And it's our good friends at Fracture.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  F-R-A-C-T-U-R-E.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Fracture.
[48:11.000 --> 48:17.000]  I feel like with my voice, I'm not enunciating that clearly.
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  Here's what Fracture does.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  They respond to a while back.
[48:20.000 --> 48:21.000]  Maybe you remember them.
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  You send them your picture.
[48:23.000 --> 48:28.000]  They print it super high quality on glass.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  And then they ship that right to you.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  It's not a picture framed in glass.
[48:33.000 --> 48:37.000]  It is a piece of glass with the picture printed right on it.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  The best way I can describe it is that difference between like
[48:41.000 --> 48:44.000]  the old iPhones when it looked like a touch, you know,
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  there was this piece of glass over the screen.
[48:46.000 --> 48:49.000]  And then when the iPhone 4 came out and it looked like the
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  pixels were actually on the screen and that they, you know,
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  it wasn't two pieces laminated together.
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  It was like one piece.
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  That's what they do at Fracture.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  They actually print the photo on the glass.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  And it's a really cool effect.
[49:02.000 --> 49:05.000]  It looks so much better than a picture underneath glass.
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Very, very cool.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  They have all sorts of sizes available.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.000]  Everything from little small things for your desk to big things
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  that you can put on a wall.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  They ship them to you in a really cool thing.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  And you don't even need to frame them.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  The picture itself can be hung right on the wall.
[49:22.000 --> 49:23.000]  And it just looks cool.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  It's just this piece of glass that is a photo that you can just
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.000]  hang on a wall and they look great without a frame.
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  You don't need to put a frame around them.
[49:31.000 --> 49:34.000]  You take the whole thing, what you buy, what they ship to you.
[49:34.000 --> 49:35.000]  You just open the box.
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  You can put it right in the wall.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  And it looks great.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  Great idea for gifts.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  I am totally going to steal this idea from Marco Armin,
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  who on last week's ATP mentioned that every time he
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  makes a new app, before he sells it to somebody else,
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  he celebrates by getting the app's icon five by five
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  fracture and then he hangs them up on his wall.
[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  So anybody out there who's like a developer, great idea.
[50:02.000 --> 50:03.000]  And it looks great.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  I have seen them on Marco's wall.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  They look beautiful.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  So you don't, you know, that's sort of an edge case,
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  but it looks great even if it's not a photo.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  It's just really, really great.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  We have a bunch of them here in the house and there's some
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  of my favorite pictures.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Where do you go to find out more?
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  Easy.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  Their website is fractureme.com.
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.000]  Fractureme.com. And if you use this code, the talk show,
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  you save 5% off any order.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  Just boom, you just save money.
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  The talk show.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  Go to fractureme, send a couple pictures,
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  get a couple back, see what I mean.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  And then like by Christmas, you'll be ordering everybody
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  in your family fracture pictures.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  It's a great service.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  Back to the show.
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  So how big is the wearable market?
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  I don't know. I honestly don't because here's what I think.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  I think if anything, if it's big, it might be sort of the opposite
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.000]  of the iPhone where the iPhone has been this like,
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  here's one new iPhone a year.
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  Here's the iPhone for the next year.
[51:09.000 --> 51:15.000]  If the wearable thing is big, I think it could be like,
[51:15.000 --> 51:18.000]  there's 15 different wearables from Apple to choose from.
[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  And maybe collectively, they're pretty big
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  and have a range in prices, but that it might,
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  so for example, just think about the old iPods,
[51:29.000 --> 51:33.000]  when the iPods were big and there were four or five of them.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  There was a little nano sized thing,
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  a little clip on thing that didn't even have a screen.
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  There was like the main regular one that was sort of mid-sized
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  and then there was the big one,
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  and they still have that lineup.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  We just don't get excited about them anymore.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  Right.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  But it could be that sort of thing.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  And you know, one or two of them are watches
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  and one or two of them are something else's and who knows?
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  Yeah, I don't really know what to think about this market either.
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  Other than the caution that it's not going to be the size of the phone market
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  because nothing is.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  And the feeling like it's going to be an accessory.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Like it feels to me like this is a device.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  You know, if there is something on your wrist,
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  it's a device that's meant to work with the iPhone
[52:13.000 --> 52:16.000]  and that actually makes it logically part of the iPhone event
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.000]  to talk about it that the iPhone is the center.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  You know, it's a little bit like the old digital hub story
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  that Steve Jobs told back in 2000,
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  except the center of the hub now is the iPhone.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  The iPhone is with you all the time.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  It's got the high speed connection.
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  And then you can have something like this,
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  whether it's one sensor that's on your wrist
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  or whether it's a constellation of different things
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  on your body and in your house and wherever else.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  And they all, you know, talk to your iPhone
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  and your iPhone collects the data
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  and relays things to the internet and all of that.
[52:47.000 --> 52:51.000]  But, you know, it doesn't feel like, you know, again,
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  it feels like it's about accessories.
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  It's about adding on, not about a category
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  that is breaking, I don't know, entirely new ground.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  You know, it's hard to even think about this
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  because it's so intertwined.
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  It's technology and it's fashion.
[53:08.000 --> 53:13.000]  And I do think it's going to rely on the iPhone
[53:13.000 --> 53:14.000]  to some degree.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  So this is the question of like,
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  how many of these are going to be sold?
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  How often is a person expected to buy one of these?
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  If you buy something and put it on your wrist
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  are you expecting to have it there for a year, two years,
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.000]  five years?
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  I don't know.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  Yeah, and, you know, it's funny.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  I've, in the same way that I've avoided
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  using the phrase iPhone 6,
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  or I've tried to, you know, wherever practical.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  I've avoided, I certainly avoid,
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  I think I've never used the word I watch.
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  Yeah.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  And I've tried to avoid calling it a watch.
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  I've been calling it a wearable.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  And I knew, you know, I know for a fact
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  that they're working on, you know, some sort of wearable stuff
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  for a while, but I didn't know any more than that
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  and I didn't want to assume watch.
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  And I heard some people say it's a watch
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  and I thought, all right, that's a possibility.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  And obviously there's a lot of companies
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  in the last 12 months that have been active
[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  making, you know, smart watches.
[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  But all that said, it seems like in the run-up to this event,
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  there's suddenly a lot more smoke, you know, in terms of,
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  you know, my triangulating these rumors,
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  I often just subscribe to you.
[54:21.000 --> 54:24.000]  If there's enough smoke, there's got to be some sort of fire.
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  And there's an awful lot of smoke specifically
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  that it's a watch, or two watches, I guess,
[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  is actually, you know, I think Nick Bolton,
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  I think from the New York Times has said that.
[54:34.000 --> 54:35.000]  Or was it Brian Chen?
[54:35.000 --> 54:38.000]  Yeah, it looks like we're at the point now where it's,
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  it's, it's leaks and counter leaks.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  And that some of this is about Apple,
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  this late in the game, it's also about Apple trying
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  to set expectations.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  So I think, I think definitely there's so much smoke here
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  that there's no way there isn't fire of some kind.
[54:53.000 --> 54:56.000]  But if it really is a watch,
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  and I think that's still, even right now, you know,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  and like I said, there's a lot of people who are listening
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  to this podcast, possibly after the event.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  So enjoy.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  As you and I are speaking on Sunday night,
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  yeah, we don't know.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  I still think if it's a watch,
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  boy, the word watch has so many expectations.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  Like people buy a watch,
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  they do not expect to replace a watch every two years.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  I mean, people buy a watch and they expect that thing to last.
[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  And if it's expensive, they really expect it to last.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  You know, and there was a leak,
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  I forget who had it that somebody said that Apple's considering
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  a $400 price point.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  And that makes me laugh in one way,
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  and it makes me think, hmm, and another,
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  because if it's true that it's $400,
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  or they're thinking about $400,
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  then I think it's not an accessory, right?
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  I think $400, you're in the range of something that's sort
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  of got to stand on its own.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  I don't know.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  I don't know.
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  It depends on what accessory means.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  I mean, it may just be to get on the internet
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  and things like that, it really needs to talk to a phone
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  or a Wi-Fi connection or something,
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  and not be its own little cell phone.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  But yeah, it's more than an impulse buy.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  At $400, you really have high expectations
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  of what that device is going to do.
[56:11.000 --> 56:12.000]  The part that made me laugh, though,
[56:12.000 --> 56:18.000]  was the 2010 Wall Street Journal story about Apple's tablet efforts
[56:18.000 --> 56:21.000]  that said that they're considering a $9,000, $99.
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  That's where my thought went to,
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  which is it almost feels like an attempt to set the bar high,
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  so when the real price is revealed,
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  everybody is relieved.
[56:31.000 --> 56:35.000]  Well, I remember at the iPod, there I did it.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  The iPad intro, original iPad intro.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  And they are like, you know, the whole spiel, you know,
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  it's got to fit between this and this.
[56:43.000 --> 56:44.000]  There has to be a reason for it.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  It has to be better than anything that this.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  And it all made sense, and they showed it,
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  and it was like, wow, that looks great.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  You know, I cannot wait to see this stuff.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  This looks super exciting.
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  This looks really cool.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  And the whole time I was thinking,
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  it's got to be $999.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Look at it. It's like a Mac, you know,
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  and it's super thin.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  And I know that making it that thin is expensive, right?
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  It's like, this thing is cooler than any MacBook.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  It may not be faster than it because I know it's running arm,
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  but it's cooler than any MacBook.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.000]  It's got to be $9.99.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  And then when they, you know,
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  the starting price was $4.99,
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  I remember that room, it was,
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  it was easily the biggest moment,
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  the most exciting moment of that event
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  had nothing to do with the actual iPad.
[57:27.000 --> 57:30.000]  Even though there was lots that was exciting about it,
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  and lots of it, most of it had been completely secret.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  But when they dropped that price,
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  it was jaw dry.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  I mean, people gasped.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  And not just because the device was cool,
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  but because that $9.99 number had come out
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  and the Wall Street Journal ran it.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  Yeah, everybody was doing those, you know,
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  beard scratching.
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  You know, well, what does it mean?
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  It will people buy it for $9.99.
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.000]  And that was like, yeah, it was all framed around that price.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  And that's exactly where my mind went with
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  with this wearable rumor.
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.000]  Is that a real price or is that the price that gets out there
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  so that when they announced that it's really $300,
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  instead of saying, wow, $300 is a little pricey,
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.000]  you say, oh my God, I can't believe it's only $300.
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  I don't know whether that's true or not,
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  but it has that feel to it, right?
[58:17.000 --> 58:18.000]  Right.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  Or even, you know, $199, you know,
[58:20.000 --> 58:23.000]  but certainly it's like, wow, people are going to get in line for it.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  Because, you know, electronics aside and the gadgetry
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  and all the health sensors and stuff presumably
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  that the thing has.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  But Fitbits don't cost that much, you know,
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.000]  I mean, there's not, you can't buy like a Rolex for $199.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  But you can buy what most people will consider
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  a pretty nice watch for $199.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  Yes.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  It's, again, it's not jewelry, it's not true luxury,
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  it's mass market luxury.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  It's like a sweet spot.
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.000]  I actually have a watch in my Amazon shopping cart
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  and because I was thinking of replacing my old watch
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  and it looks pretty nice in its 30 bucks.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  And then my wife actually instead bought me a watch
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.000]  for our anniversary at like Macy's or something.
[59:08.000 --> 59:10.000]  And it's a very nice watch,
[59:10.000 --> 59:13.000]  but it's probably $150 watch.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  It's not great.
[59:14.000 --> 59:17.000]  You know, you can go to, yeah, you go to store like Macy's
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  and you know, look at that.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  So for, you know, at those prices Apple
[59:21.000 --> 59:26.000]  could make, you know, a profitable device.
[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  But it's a lot more than most people have spent on watches,
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  you know, so it's, you know,
[59:32.000 --> 59:36.000]  so somebody who does collect, you know, Rolex or Amiga
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  or whatever watches might think,
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  well, $199, that's not really a luxury watch.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  But most people would think, wow,
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  this is gonna be the most expensive watch I've ever bought,
[59:44.000 --> 59:46.000]  but I can't wait to have it.
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  I could totally see it that way.
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  I don't, you know, I don't know.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  It's a strange, and the fact that Apple has hired
[59:54.000 --> 59:59.000]  all of these people who come from like luxury brands.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  It makes you wonder on one level
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  and yet sometimes I think we take that too literally
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  is like, you know, because on a grand scale Apple
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  is a luxury brand and that having them,
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  having them at Apple doesn't necessarily mean
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  they're making, you know, $1,000 gold smart watch.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  It doesn't follow that, that is the case.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  But it does make me wonder, you know,
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  especially since this is replaceable technology,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  this is not stuff that's gonna be valid in seven years
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  or five years maybe or four years even,
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  what this product is.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Because if it's a luxury product and it's beautiful,
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  what's its shelf life?
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  How long is a reasonable amount of time?
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I have my dad's Rolex that he bought in Switzerland
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  in the 60s, in the early 60s, and you know,
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  I've had it like cleaned and stuff,
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  but he gave it to me a few years before he died,
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  and it's beautiful, and you know,
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  it's from 50 plus years ago and works fine.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  These things are not gonna be like that,
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  even if they're great and made wonderful materials
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  and that the leather and the metal and all of that is good,
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  the electronic stuff is gonna be surpassed in a year.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  Yeah, and it won't be interesting.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  You were not gonna be able to pass that down to your son
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  and have it be interesting 50 years from now.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  No, it might be an interesting like history item,
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  but it's not gonna be something you would wear for a night out.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  Right, and think about this.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Now, circle back to the discussion we just had
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  about how the word phone has taken a new meaning,
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  and it doesn't mean, you know, to like what our parents mean.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  My dad, you know, thinks a phone is a thing
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  that's connected to the wall.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  That's how we curly-cored.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Right, and it's what he uses to talk to me about baseball.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  The same exact thing could happen to the word watch, right?
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  We're right now today a watch means this thing like you're talking about,
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  like wherever you talk about a nice watch,
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  you're talking about a thing that your dad could have bought in 1962,
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  and which is like still in perfect working order
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  and serviceable, and has enormous emotional resonance with you
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  because, you know, he's not with us anymore.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  That's right.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  No, it's for four years.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Right, so now it's a priceless artifact, right?
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  Exactly.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  The watch could take on a totally new meaning
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  that evolves past that where even it could happen quickly,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  because look how quickly it's happened with the word phone,
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  or even 10, 15 years from now, watch doesn't mean that anymore.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Watch means computer on your wrist.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Right, computer on your wrist with an expectation that it's collecting data
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  about your health and it's telling you when something important is happening,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  and yeah, it could do that.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  I think that's what makes this story so fascinating
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  because, again, we're looking at something where we've seen some companies try this,
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  and they've done some interesting things.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  They're definitely interesting.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  The pieces are all there for something interesting,
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  but there's one, the question of how you mix them together,
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  and two, is that thing then something that people actually want?
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  Because I talked to a lot of people who say they don't wear a watch
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  or they stopped or they never wore a watch,
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  and so what do you have?
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Is Apple trying to motivate people to strap something on their wrist
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  and what's the value you get out of doing that?
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Well, to me, that's a super interesting question
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  because is it better for you to be a watch wearer already?
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And an Apple just has to convince you to get their watch
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  and replace yours with theirs, or is it better if you're not
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  and you've got an open wrist?
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  Watch doesn't mean anything to you.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  You've got an open wrist.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  They don't even have to convince you that the Apple watch
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  is better than your fossil watch that you've been wearing for a while
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  or the Rolex that you're wearing, you know, that costs 10 times more.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  If you have an open wrist, maybe it's a wide open thing
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  because it's solving an entirely different problem.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  It's, you know, your fossil watch or your Movado or your Omega
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  is primarily just telling you the time.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And maybe that's not even what the watch does.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Like, that's one of the things I wonder, like all these other smart watches
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  start with the idea that by default you just look at the screen
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  or like with the pebble you have to turn it on.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Right.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  The pebble's always on.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Right, it is always on.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  But you have to do something to make it light up if it's...
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Right, if it's dark.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Right.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  But primarily the first thing it's doing is telling you the time.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Yep.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  And what if that wasn't the baseline?
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Right.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  What if that's not the baseline?
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  What if it's not like that?
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  You know, and there's rumors that it has that this Apple thing has a color screen
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  and that it's going to run apps and that's probably running, you know, iOS.
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  And there's no way, there's no way Apple's going to do a black and white.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  No way.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  It's impossible.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  So if it has a display, it must be a color display.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And all these other ones, like the Moto 360, you know, came out this week
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  or shipped this week finally.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Right.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  And the other Android Wear phones have come out.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  And their default watch faces are skeuomorphic representations of what we traditionally think
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  of as fine watches.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  Right.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  And at least in pictures, they look like...
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Wow, that does look like a real watch.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  It's kind of interesting.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  That looks nice.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  People say they look nice.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  To me, they don't look nice.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  But, and, you know, and I think I've still not seen an Android Wear one in person.
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  But I'm pretty sure if I saw it in person.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  I would think it looks like a nice watch in a way that like the iPhone calculator used
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  to look like a nice, bronze calculator.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  It didn't look like a nice bronze calculator.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  It was, you know, just a piece of glass and I had like the buttons on it.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  It might have been a cool...
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  It was a cool...
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  I thought it was a cool way to make a calculator app for the iPhone.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  But it never would have interested me and fascinated me like if somebody said,
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  hey, by the way, I've got this 1972 bronze calculator that was my dad.
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  And that I would think, ooh, look at that.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:22.000]  See, it's the uncanny valley where you're trying to be a thing to simulate a thing.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Right.
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  So hard that it ends up being weird.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  The pebbles like this too.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  The pebble faces that I use are not at all attempting to look like real watches.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  There's like the one with the words.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  And there's the one with like a little animated face on it.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  But like a cartoon character face.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  But they're not like the...
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  They're actual like this looks like a real watch face.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Those are awful.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  I can't even look at them because they hurt my eyes because they are aping a real watch.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  And they're fighting against...
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  They're fighting against what the pebble is good at.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  And fighting it in a direction where one of the things the pebble is good at is unlike a lot of these things,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  pebble actually gets reasonable battery life.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Right.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  You know, you can wear it for a couple days at least.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  I can get six days out of it.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  Right.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Which is way better than all these other ones.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  Right.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  And part of the reason they can do that is that they have this really low resolution.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  I think it's like 160 by 160 e-ink display.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Yeah.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  So it's never going to be able to look pretty in a way that a watch looks pretty.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  But then, you know, they just use like the words or something like that.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  Right.
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And those look good.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  But when they...
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  And yeah, it's not a very good display.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  But they still try to ape like a watch with hands.
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  And it looks terrible.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  And I think that...
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:42.000]  I think that's an interesting point of what Apple tries to do
[1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  is not trying to make it look like you'd mistake it for a Swiss watch.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Right.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  But it's a new...
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  And this would be a very Apple thing to do with...
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  It's a new thing that you put on your wrist.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  And it might even tell you the time.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  But it's not trying to be mistaken for a Rolex, right?
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  It's just not what it's trying to do.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Right.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Like imagine 2007.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Steve Jobs says, here's the iPhone.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He takes it out of his pocket.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  The crowd's going nuts.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  And it would be before he turns it on.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  It looks like exactly the same.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  It's a black piece of glass.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  And he turns it on.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  And it turns to the phone dialer.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Right.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  That would have been...
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Because then that's using this thing to make it look like
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  whatever we all thought of as a phone.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  A thing with a...
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  You know...
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  zero underneath.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  A red hang up button, a green call button.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And I don't know, like a star button underneath
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  where you would hit the star button to then access,
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  you know, the other stuff.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  Yeah, or imagine that the dialer is the home screen.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  Right.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  If you press the button.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  Then it'll show you...
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  It'll slide up a thing that shows you apps.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  But like the default is dialing.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Right.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  That's exactly what I was trying to say.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Like the home screen is a phone dialer.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Because that's a phone.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And that to me is what all the smartwatches have done so far.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  Where the home screen is analog wristwatch
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  with an hour hand and a minute hand.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And they're all, you know, and the people who are praising,
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  like the Moto 360, the people who think it looks good.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And, you know, some of the Samsung ones that just came out.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  They're doing it in a skeuomorphic way.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  The, you know, aping, fine analog wristwatches,
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  which is exactly the opposite of everything Apple has done
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  software-wise in iOS 7, starting a year ago,
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  and with Yosemite coming up imminently.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Oh, and do you want to compete with those devices?
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  I mean, this is going back to your point of like,
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  is the wide open space of people who don't wear a watch
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  or don't think about watches.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  It's a better place to go to than people who love watches,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  which is an interesting idea.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  But I like the idea that, you know,
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  you don't want to compete with a Rolex
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  because you are not going to win.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  First off, you're not a Rolex.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  You're the resolution of your screen,
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  and your battery life is never going to compete with that Rolex.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  But you do have some other things going for you.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  They're not that.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  So don't be that.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  Be that.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Be the thing you are.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  Be something else.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Right.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  It's exactly right.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  And you can compete with the Rolex on what the thing looks like
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  on your wrist at a distance.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Sure.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  You know, it's that sort of thing.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Nice materials and all of that,
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  but it's not the same device and, you know,
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  you're not just trying to create a computer
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  that ends up being a watch.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  Right.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Good one.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  In the same way that every iPhone ever made,
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  especially all the ones other than the 3G and 3GS.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  But, you know, the original one
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and then back with starting with the four
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  and going through today,
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  they look like nice devices in your hand,
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  even before you turn them on.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  They're just, to me,
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  aesthetically pleasing pieces of material.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  And they can totally compete on it.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I just think when it comes to the face,
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  whatever it is,
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  whether it's a square,
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  whether it's a band-aid strip type thing,
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  or a circle,
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  I don't know.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  I don't think Apple would do a circle
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  because I think a circle is a way to skew.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  I think just having a circular screen is skeuomorphic
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  and, you know, it anchored in the world of watches.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  I mean, that's the story.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Motorola tells of how they came to a circle.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  They did like a,
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  they admit to doing like a focus group
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  where they asked children,
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  what do you think a watch looks like?
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And they said a circle.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  And they said, okay, we'll make our thing a circle.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And it's like, you're asking them what it should be
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  based on the thing you're trying to supplant, right?
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  Right.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  It's like, imagine if Apple had decided to make
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  start with the iPhone and ask children,
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  well, what does a telephone look like?
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Let's get push buttons.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Right.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  They weren't going to say it looks like the monolith
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  from 2001.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Well, this is the old faster horse thing, right?
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Which is that, you know, do you want to just,
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  is your idea of the next thing,
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  you know, a better version of the old thing
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  or is it something that's completely different?
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  And I think, I feel like, you know,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  people again who have listened to this
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  afterwards laugh and laugh,
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  but I feel like that's what Apple ideally would do
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  is throw all that away and say,
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  if we're going to do a wearable device,
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  what we're not going to do is make it
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  pretend to be the old thing.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  But instead, start from zero of like,
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  you know, having something on your body
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  has a lot of benefits.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  It's easier to glance at your wrist
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  and this is one of the reasons I like the notifications
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  in the Pebble.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  It's like people always say,
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  well, you've got your phone in your pocket.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  It's like, you know,
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  my wrist is way more accessible than my pocket.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  And women who often have to carry their phone in a bag,
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  you know, again, their wrist is way more accessible
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  than the phone that's tucked away in the bag.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  So that's a benefit and being on your body
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  and being able to do things like read your heart rate
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  and since your movements,
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  all of that is an advantage to being on there.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  So start with the advantages of why you'd
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  want to be on somebody's wrist
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  rather than start with a watch.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Never underestimate how much
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  the stuff that you've just gotten used to
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  is actually a huge pain in the ass.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  I'm sure when indoor plumbing came,
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  you know, that there were people who were like,
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  oh my God, put a thing I'm going to
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  crap in right in my house.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  No way.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  You're going to put water pipes all throughout the house
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  and drains.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Do you realize how much harder it's going to be
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  to make a house when you do that?
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Right, exactly.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  And then, you know, it's, of course,
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  you don't want to go out and have a little dirty box
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  in your backyard to go to the bathroom.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Very few outhouses anymore.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  Yeah, very few outhouses anymore.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  And, you know, that's one thing,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  I was just talking to somebody on Twitter
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  just like a random reader who's like,
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  hey, if the watch has NFC
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  and admit, you know, everybody's excited about this stuff.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  If, you know, he was like,
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  I know it's a big if,
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  but just go with me.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  If the watch has NFC
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  and is part of this payments thing,
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  then it's got to have touch IT too, right?
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And my answer was no.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  I think it definitely wouldn't have touch ID
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  because touch ID would be ugly
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  because it's got to be, you know,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  reasonably fingertip-sized.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And there's nowhere on a watch
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  to put a fingertip-sized thing
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  that's just for you to put your finger on.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  Right.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  And it's already touching your skin.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  And I know that's not your fingerprint
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  underneath there,
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  but my guess might just random guess.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  I don't know, but I just said
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  there's got to be some other biometric thing
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  that it could maybe do to create an ID.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Because I don't think it would have that.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  And then there were other people who like chirped in
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  and they're like, it doesn't need a touch ID
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  because you'll have your iPhone with you.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:52.000]  And that is touch ID.
[1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  So then you can just take your iPhone out
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and use that for the touch ID part.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  Well, then what's the point of having the thing on your wrist?
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Right.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  There's no point.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  Don't underestimate how much of a pain in the as it might be
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  that we'd have to take our phone out all the time.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Yep.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  Right?
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  That's, to me, the key to this, you know,
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  having the thing on your wrist.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Like all of a sudden, maybe we start using the iPhone last.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Well, yeah.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  I mean, if you wave,
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  if you imagine going up to the at the drug store
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  bottle of soda and you're, or you're like a milk jug
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  because you ran out of milk and just like waving your wrist,
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  like boop and walking out.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  And then eventually, presumably, you know, with RFID
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  just walking out.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  Right.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  And you get charged for the milk and that's it.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  Then, you know, that, yeah, that is easier
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  than pulling it out of your pocket.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  It's marginally easier, but over time,
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  even marginally easier is easier.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Right.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  And it could be, it could be.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  You know, Marco Arman linked to a site of one of these like
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  mock-up sites.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  And it was the, it was the only round watch thing
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  that I've seen that I thought I, I thought I liked.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  And I'm not saying that Apple would do it,
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:06.000]  but the one thing that intrigued me about this site is that
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  it was suggesting using the watch metaphor as user interaction.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  And what I liked about it was the idea they had actually said
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  it might not even be a touch screen.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  That if you, if you're going to have a round device,
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  you could use the ring, kind of like the click wheel.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  You could actually use the ring for navigation.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  Perhaps you push down or tap, and you can spin around.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  And then you might even have like some wheels on the side.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  I doubt that Apple would do it,
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  but I thought that was kind of an interesting idea that
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  I hadn't really thought of before, which is
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  could, could a device like this not be driven by
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  swipes and taps on a touch screen.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  But some other, you know, in this case it was spinning,
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  essentially turning a dial, turning like sort of like
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  the old iPod.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  I thought it was really, it wasn't something I thought of
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  and I thought it was really interesting.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  I kind of feel, I think like, like you do,
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  that they're much more likely to just kind of walk away
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  from the traditional watch interface and not try to make a,
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  a watch that looks like a watch, but is actually not,
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  but instead make a new thing.
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  But I thought it was an interesting idea of like the other
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  part of Apple's history, which is this kind of circular
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  navigation thing that I guess if Tony Fadell
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  were still at Apple, maybe that would be the direction.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  I don't know.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  But I wouldn't be surprised though.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Like it seems, there's a great idea in there and it may not
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  be going back to circle, but I think the right idea is
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  just because we've gotten used to this,
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  doesn't mean the next thing is still going to be this, right?
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  So we got used to the command line with our Apple twos
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  and then the Mac came out.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  And there was no command line.
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  None.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  There were no way to issue commands.
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  Mine boggles the keyboard.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  Right.
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  It truly was.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And I know that the people who are born post Macintosh
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  cannot, that you just can't fathom it.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  A computer was the thing that when you turned on,
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  you got a blinking prompt and you would type
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  computery things and they could be dangerous.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  First of all, I saw the Mac.
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  I thought, how do you write programs on this thing?
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  Right.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  Somebody tried to explain it to me.
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  I was like, I don't understand how that can be.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  It just, it doesn't make any sense how there could be programs
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  on this.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Well, that my thought when I first saw the Mac was,
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  how do you do something?
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  How do you do the things you need to do that this?
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  I was infatuated with the graphical user interface.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  But to me, it was like a game.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  It was like the interface was a game that let you play
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  computer.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  And I was like, well, when you need to do something else,
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  how do you do it?
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  If you don't have a, if there's no way to close this,
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  I want to close this and get back to the black screen.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  It has a, has a prompt.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  Yep.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  You know, and I was, right, and I remember thinking like,
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  oh my God, and what are we going to deal with those spaces
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  on the file names when you're on the command line?
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  I don't think I'd ever seen a system that had backslashes
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  at that point.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  Or if I did, I'd never learned it.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Right.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  And then, you know, there was none.
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  It's a new thing.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  And with the,
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  this is actually kind of how I feel about the iPod Nano
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  by the way right now, which is that it is a weird product
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  that does feel like it's aping.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Yeah.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  Badly.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  The iPhone.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  Yeah.
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  Because it's not iOS.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  You can swipe and tap.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  And it's, you know, when you tap things happen,
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  it's just, it's not right.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  It's, you know, here's a, here's a really great example.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  So a great example to me is the original iPod.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  And we had handheld devices and they had like navigation
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  and it was up and down, left and right.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Right.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  It was joystick style or up, down, up, down.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  And all the music players today used that.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  And the problem, the biggest problem was it had gotten
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  to the point where it was easy to have a thousand songs
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  and going up, up, up, up, up a thousand times is just no good.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  You can't do it and holding the button down.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  It just, you don't have enough control.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  So that wheel, it was genius because I had speed.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  It was, you know, it was completely under control.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  You could flick it.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  And all of a sudden you had this new thing that we'd never used
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  before, but it was really useful.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  And you could use it to navigate literally thousands of songs.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  Uh, you know, and then, you know,
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  flash forward 10 years or actually it wasn't 10 years,
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  six years.
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:16.000]  Uh, people with that.
[1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Yeah, that's my phone was only six years after the iPod.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  Six years.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  And you know, we all went in thinking that the iPhone was going
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  to be that gag slide of a click wheel with a phone on top.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:28.000]  Right.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  Uh, no.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  So yeah, I do kind of think that.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  Mano shows that like you shrink the size small enough.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  And your finger covers the screen, you know, and it's,
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  it's a problem even on an iPad.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  It's always a problem that your finger covers what it is.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  You're touching when you touch.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  But if you shrink the screen small enough,
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  you can't compensate for it, you know,
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  like on the way that the, the perfect example is the way on the,
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  the standard iPhone keyboard.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Um, do you love how I now have to refer to it?
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  Is that the standard iPhone keyboard?
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  When you type a key, it shows you what you typed above your finger.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  It flashes up.
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  Right.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  And that's an affordance for the fact that you can't see which one you're touching
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  because it's underneath your, your thumb or your finger.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  On something the size of a watch, there's no way to afford that
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  because your thumb covers over half of it.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  Exactly.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  So I would not be surprised at all, even if it has a very nice color display
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  that it is not a touch screen because I don't know that touch is right at all
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  for something that's not.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  Especially if it's small and especially if there's a, you know,
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  a version that, that women would want to wear or people with smaller
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  wrists would want to wear.
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  At that point, you either get these devices that are huge
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  or you get something that's smaller and there's no,
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  there's no touch target left.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  At least, at least touch in the sense of tapping objects on a screen.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  I mean, it's possible that you could do something with touch that is,
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  you know, swiping up and down on the side or something like that as a,
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  as a movement, but it's not the same as like, I am going, I see a thing
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  and I'm going to touch it with my finger and then it'll do something.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  Below a certain size, you just can't do it.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  And the Nano is sort of there where it's almost pointless to navigate
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  because you can really only touch on one.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Maybe there's a couple things, but it's like, with the point.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Think about the previous generation Nano, the one that was turned into a watch
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  with the TikTok and stuff like that.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  And which I've mentioned before on the show that if you're a smartwatch,
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  actual smartwatch doesn't look better than a,
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  than a previous generation iPod Nano, which wasn't designed to be a watch.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Right.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  On the TikTok, which was a Kickstarter project,
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  then you've got a serious problem because that wasn't meant to be a watch.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  And some of these smartwatches don't look as good as my three-year-old Nano on a TikTok.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Right.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  But on that size touchscreen, it's a real problem.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  I never know what to do.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  Yeah, they've got like two buttons, or four buttons you can tap,
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  but it's just, and the swipe area is very small.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  Right.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  And it's a nice try at unifying your product line if you're Apple
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  and saying, look, people are used to this, so we'll do it.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  But it is not, if you were designing that in a vacuum,
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  you would not design it that way, because it doesn't fit right.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  And so I wonder about that.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  Whether it's something like what Marco showed me,
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  that is this, it's circular, and the ring is like the click wheel,
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  or it's something that is a rectangular, and you're not expecting to touch on the screen.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  But there's some other interaction.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  I don't know.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  It's an interesting, interesting problem, and it will be interesting to see
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  whether Apple leans on the side of a new interaction,
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  or whether they try to make it feel as iPhone-like as possible.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  I just can't help coming back to the idea that what's happened is
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  everybody in the industry has gotten the ability to make these.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  I've, I'm just going to call them iPhone-like devices.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  Right.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  And everything post-PC that we've had, Android, Windows Phone,
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  whatever you want to call the OS.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And there's, you know, I'm not saying they're all copies,
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  I'm just saying, no, they're all derivative of this idea of a touch screen,
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  and a Unix-like operating system running on a real computer under the hood,
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  and a real operating system on top where you can put apps and stuff like that.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  And we've gotten to the point where everybody can make one now
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  that is small enough to be called a watch.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  And maybe not a small watch.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  In fact, all of these things are kind of huge by the standard of watches,
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  but we can make them like Dick Tracy's watch size,
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  which is a remarkable achievement.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  And I think that all of the enthusiasm you do see on sites that are reviewing them
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  and giving them positive reviews, even though they seemingly have glaring problems
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  in terms of just, is it actually useful and is it actually a good product?
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I think it's just general excitement of holy crap you can have a computer on your wrist.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  Yeah, it's a technological achievement, it really is.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Right, right.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  I mean, just, you know, you and I are, if not identically aged, we're very close in age,
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  you go back to the 90s until Jason Snell and John Gruber
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  that you're going to have a Unix computer running on your wrist in the year 2014.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  And I'm going to, I'm thinking, holy shit, we're having jet cars and jet packs too, right?
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  I mean, that's crazy, because a Unix computer in 1993 was like a room.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  It was like a refrigerator.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  I'm imagining like, like one of those wrist things that like space ghost had.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  It's like, it's like doubles the size of your wrist.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  It's like, that's what I would think.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  It's like, well, it's going to be huge.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  And why would you put that on your wrist?
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Not thinking, you know, how could it be?
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  These are mainframes.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  These are like more computer than a computer.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  And you're going to have that in my, in your pocket or on your wrist.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  That's crazy talk.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  And so just because you can build it, it's cool that you can't,
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  but just because you can't, doesn't mean that that's actually a good form factor for that.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  And it's the exact same as thinking.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  The nano and the TikTok and the lunatic.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  I mean, showed that, right?
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  It's like, you could do it.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  It's not that good, but you could do it.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Right.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  And it's the exact same thing of why didn't the original iPhone run the Mac OS,
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  where you drag little windows around and you have a file menu,
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  you know, a menu bar at the top.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  It would have worked at some level conceptually,
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  but it definitely would have been, you know, would have been a bad idea.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  I mean, we would have bought them or we would have reviewed them.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And it might have been some cool things you could do it.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  And I'm sure they would have, you know, scaled the things up.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  It wouldn't have been like you're trying to touch a tiny little,
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  20 pixel thing at the top.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  But, you know, it just wasn't the right interaction model.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  Because can't help but think, but that's where the wearables are.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  But everybody else is, is stuck thinking that they should make a tiny,
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  modern cell phone on your wrist and nobody would want to,
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  you don't want to, you don't want to phone that small.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  Right.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  I think, I think no, no sane person would want a phone that small.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  In fact, I think that's actually a strong argument.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  I wrote a piece about this a while ago that the idea that, um,
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  I don't want, I don't want something on my wrist to be a phone.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Right.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  Like, I don't think it's the right place for a phone.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  I wouldn't, if you could say you don't need to carry your iPhone around anymore.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  I'm going to strap this thing to your wrist and it's your iPhone.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  I don't think I would want that because it's so, it would have to be so small
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  that the way you interacted with it would be difficult.
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And, you know, this is why bigger phones are more popular in the room,
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  whereas that Apple's going to have larger phones.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  So what goes on your wrist, you know, is, it's, it's,
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  that real estate is great, but it's different.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  And, and I don't want it to be the same interaction because it's not the same.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  It's not only in a different place on my body, it's, it's strapped to my wrist.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  So I've got to hold my arm in a certain way to get to it.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Which also means it's one-handed operation because I can't bend my other hand back.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  And it's tiny.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  So it's not, you know, the rules don't apply.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Even though it's convenient to say, hey, it falls the same rules as your phone,
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  it's not the same place.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  So the rules should not apply.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  It's a different device.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  Yeah.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Let's come back to that idea of a big-ass iPhone.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  But at first, I want to tell you about our third sponsor and start good friends at Hover.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  Hover is the domain name registrar that doesn't suck.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  And these guys, I, I, I repeat it every time, but it's such a scummy industry.
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  And it's, it's, it's like going into the bad part of town.
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  Usually when you go to a domain name registrar.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Hover has been around forever.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  They've always just been an honest company.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  They may not be the cheapest.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  I'm sure you could go somewhere else and register a domain name for less.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  That's not what they're trying to be.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  They're trying to be the best.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  And they've been in business for a long time.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  And they have so many great features.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  The best one, the best thing that they have, on my opinion, is their customer service.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  And what they call valetransfer.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  They make it easy to manage all your domains in one place.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  And so let's say you've been registering domain names like a dummy since the mid 90s.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  Every time you have a goofy idea for a domain name.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  I'm not looking at anybody in particular.
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  That sounds familiar to me.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Yeah, it sounds familiar to a lot of you who are listening, right?
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  And you've got them registered all over the place.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  And every time they come up for renewal and you get the email and you think,
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  oh my God, I've had that thing since 1998, but it's still such a funny domain.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.000]  I better keep it, right?
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  It's only 15 bucks or whatever for a couple years.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  But they're all over the place and you've got them registered at three different places.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  And some of them you don't even like because they're the bad businesses.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  And you go to the website and it's terrible.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  What you can do is you go to hover and you sign up at hover.
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  And you just give them your information for the places where you have your domain names registered.
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  And they'll take care of everything in terms of moving them over.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  And even if you haven't hooked up and they're in use and you have it pointed to a silly,
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  you know, single purpose website where you're making a joke for one of your friends or something like that.
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  It's not just moving the domain name into your name and putting it at hover.
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  They'll take care of everything with updating DNS and getting it all pointed the right way so that everything is just seamless.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:24.000]  And then when the DNS updates, all of a sudden your domains are registered at hover.
[1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  And all of your sites just keep working.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  And these guys that they know this, like I every time I have to do anything related to DNS,
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  I panic because it's so easy to screw up.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  Because I don't deal with it on a regular basis.
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  Whereas that's all hover does is deal with domain names.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  Amazing, amazing stuff.
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  And here's the best thing you do.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  If you can find somebody, find one of your friends who has domains at hover.
[1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  They will tell you, they'll say you're not if you don't move over because it's that good.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  I have 15 domains at hover now.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  Am I having a problem?
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  How many of them it actually is?
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  Well, if you can't read, I have a lot of them redirecting where you buy one.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  But I could get the.co and I could get this alternate spelling and I could have them all redirect and all of that.
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  And a couple that, like you said, are the jokes where it's like, oh, how could I not?
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  We did this in a 200th episode of the incomparable a guy said that wrote in.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  He said we hit him in the butter zone.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  And we just started laughing.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  And we went with that joke for a long time.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  And I realized I could register the butter dot zone.
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:34.000]  Right.
[1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  So I did.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  See, that's what you can do now with these wacky new top level domains.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.000]  Instead of going to butterzone.com, now the entire domain is part of the joke.
[1:31:44.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  And there's no superfluous non joke part of the domain name.
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  No, it's 100% pure stupid joke.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  Oh, and they've got all those.
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  And they're totally on board that I probably should mention that.
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  With all these goofy new top level domains, you can do that.
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  And I think that I think there's a Marco dot coffee that everybody should check out.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  Probably registered through hover, all sorts of stuff like that.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  Use this code.
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  Here's the code for the month.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  It's a chowder.
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  C-H-O-W-D-E-R.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  That's their in joke for daring fireball readers.
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  And go to hover.com and find out more.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  My thanks to Oliver.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  So I would smoke so much smoke where there's fire.
[1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  The thing with two iPhones, 4.7 and 5.5 inches.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  And there's still a lot of people out there who are skeptical of it.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  I don't know for a fact anything.
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  Nobody tells me anything.
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  I'm telling you it's got to be true because somebody would have leaked.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  Don't don't expect a 5.5 inch iPhone by now if there wasn't one coming.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  I agree.
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  There's too much.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.000]  It's like what we said about a couple of these topics earlier.
[1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:58.000]  Apple doesn't leak all this stuff, and they don't like that it leaks.
[1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  But one thing Apple does do.
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:06.000]  And you know this, and I know this, and certainly like the times in the journal know this,
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  is Apple does leak to manage expectations because they are in risk of being harmed
[1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  if people go into an event expecting things that are totally not going to happen
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  because then they'll be disappointed.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  So sometimes you will see these stories where it'll be like,
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  look, they're not going to do this.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  Or what we saw was, look, it's probably not going to be out until next year.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Just like, don't get your hopes up that it's going to ship next week.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  It's probably not going to be out until next year.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  And I feel like since they haven't said that, like you said, they haven't said no, no,
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  there's no bigger iPhone.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  It's not going to happen that it's probably going to happen because they probably,
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  the buzz is so large, probably somebody would have batted it down if it was totally untrue.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  Especially at this point, days before.
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  And that's why I think there's a bunch, you know, that does seem to be a spurt of stuff coming out.
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  Like Brian X Chen, it might be the thing you're talking about.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  He had a piece in the New York Times yesterday, where among other things,
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  he said that the new bigger iPhones have a one-handed mode,
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  which is a thing I made fun of on the Samsung Galaxy Note a year ago,
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  which was, you know, well, how did in the world do you use these giant phones
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  when you're only holding it in one hand?
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  And, you know, the Samsung Galaxy Note had a thing.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  I forget how you engaged it, but then all of a sudden it just put like the equivalent
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  of like a regular four-inch phone in the lower right corner of the phone.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  And I presume you could also put it in the lower left if you're left-handed.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  But then it just, you know, and then all the other, there's like a big L-shaped letterboxing around it.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I have no idea, Chen does not describe the one-handed mode of the new iPhone.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  But I would not be surprised at all if that's true,
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  because 5.5-inch phones are ridiculous, as phones, as we know, you know.
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  I've used the 5.5-inch or something very close to a 5.5-inch Nokia when I was build.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  I've said this before.
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  It is a fascinating device.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  It is, you know, it seems very intriguing.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  I think an Apple iPhone that was that size will sell huge.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  I don't think a majority of people want that, though.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  I think the people who do are going to love it.
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  But one thing, there's just no if-answer butts about it, you know, like when,
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  when the iPhone grew from 3.5 to 4 inches, which was minimal change in size compared to what we're talking about with 5.5 inches.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  There was all sorts of stuff in the event talking about the features in the OS that help you so that, you know, yes, now it's harder to navigate,
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  but we have this edge gesture where you can swipe back from the left to go back,
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  so you don't have to hit that back button all the way up in the top corner.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  Like, there's no way to mitigate this with, you know, a little software tricks like that.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  If you have a 5.5-inch display on your phone, even if all of the surrounding area is minimized to the most possible degree,
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  it's still too big to use in one hand.
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  You have to hold it in one hand and use it in the other, and there's no way around it.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  For many people, that's not it.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  That's what I don't think it's a deal breaker.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Obviously, if Apple's shipping it, they don't either.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  It doesn't mean they shouldn't build the device.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  It just means in the world of trade-offs, people are willing to have X, Y, and Z bigger video, games that are bigger,
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  better battery life, which I want to come back to in a second, and they're willing to give up.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  I'm able to use the phone in one hand.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Or, if Chen is right and there's a mode, they're willing to invoke what I think is good.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  Even if Apple does it, it's going to be silly.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Sure, it's going to be like what direction are you tilted, and it's like,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  oh, now it's suddenly this app is smaller, and now you can reach the...
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  Although, I don't know, I don't think about it from an iPad's perspective.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  I don't worry about not being able to use my iPad in one hand.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Yeah, but you don't walk around the city with it.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  I know, but this is a big device.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  I get that there's more need for it than there is on an iPad,
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  but I've got an iPad mini, and sometimes I think there is not...
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  This is an interesting intersection between this very large iPhone and the very small iPad.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Well, let me put it this way.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  If Brian Chen hadn't written that, I wouldn't have brought up a one-handed mode with you on this show.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Because it's such a silly thing to me that it's such a silly notion to me that it wouldn't have even occurred to me.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  But he wrote it.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  He doesn't say he's seen it, but he says sources familiar with the matter say that it's going to have it.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  So, given that, and I'm not saying that means it's true,
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  I'm just saying, you know, it's the New York Times and Brian X Chen.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  I mean, I have some issues with Brian X Chen, but his reporting when he says the source says X is excellent.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  It's typical times quality.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  So, like I said, it's not a done deal.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  I'm sure there's some kind of wiggle room out where it could be something else entirely.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  And it was mistaken as a one-handed mode.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Or they tried it and it didn't go...
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  It didn't make it into the final version.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  But I would not be surprised at all.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Having played with one of these devices, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they did it.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  You know, if there's some kind of thing, maybe it's just in a control center.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  And you flick up from the bottom, and there's a new button you can hit,
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  and it shrinks the screen to the lower right corner.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  I don't know.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  I think it would be silly, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did it.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Because these phones are ridiculously big compared to what we're used to.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  So, if you've built your usage, you know, here's how I typically use my phone.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  Often using it while holding it in the same device you're using it with,
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  you're not going to be able to do that with the new device.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  Right. I think that's where it comes into being an issue.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Because for me, I think about large device, and I think this is basically the smallest iPad we can put in your pocket.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  Right.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  Not the biggest iPhone.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And that's not true.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Although I saw on Twitter today that Steve Troughton Smith,
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  who likes to poke around in Xcode and find weird things,
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  seems to suggest that if you're using a screen size like that and you're in landscape,
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  it actually uses iPad resources, which is really interesting.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Like it's just big enough that you might be able to use an iPad view.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  And of course, then you're then you're almost certainly not doing it one-handed if you're tilting it sideways.
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  But I don't know.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  It's a funny intersection.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Because like I said, I really love my iPad mini.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  And I wonder sometimes about could I get away with one device if it was bigger than my iPhone,
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  but smaller than my mini, would it be good enough that I wouldn't need to?
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  Or would it be just bad on both counts? I don't know.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  That comes right back to that WWDC session that I've been recommending people want to think it's session 216,
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  which is building adaptive layout, which is Apple's terminology for flexible layouts or responsive layouts.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  But in their terminology, they don't call them phone width or tablet width.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  They call it like regular width, compact width, regular height, compact height.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  And so like an iPad is like regular width, regular height.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Like you can show the full interface.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  A phone is regular height.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  So you can put like a big scrolling list, but it's called a compact width.
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  A regular iPhone, like an iPhone today, even when you turn it in landscape is still a compact width.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Like it's not a specific number of pixels or points.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  It just says like a compact width even held horizontally just means, hey, mail.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  If you're showing a list, just show one list at a time and don't show the list side by side with the content.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  Whereas what he's saying, and that's very interesting to me, would be that just the 5.5 inch iPhone,
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  if you hold it horizontally, when you're in mail, you'll suddenly see a list of messages taking like the first third.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  And when you select one, you'll see the message on the right, like an iPad.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  Right.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  And that's where that settings will have a list on the left side and then the pain on the right, instead of it being something you enter into.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  Right.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  And if you think about that, I believe that.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  And not just because he's a great Twitter account.
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  He's very, very astute hacker in the best sense of hacker in terms of it's losing those things out of the beta X codes and stuff.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  But I believe it because I think that's the message Apple has been preaching, especially this year at WWDC, is to stop thinking about iPhone apps and iPad apps.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  And so don't think of the 5.5 inch iPhone as just a big iPhone or perhaps, and there's so many people on Twitter and email who think,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  hey, maybe it's not an iPhone at all, maybe it's an iPad Nano and it'll run iPad apps.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Well, no, it's too small to run iPad apps.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  It's just, if you really, really take an iPad app and just shrink it to 5.5 inches and print it out on a piece of paper, you'll see immediately that everything is too small to touch.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  But it totally makes sense to me that if you held it sideways, that you could sort of give it an iPad-ish layout, if not, but not by shrinking the iPad interface exactly.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  You know what I mean?
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  It's just, hey, use one third of the screen for the list, the other two thirds of the screen for the content and figure it out dynamically based on how many points or how big the thing should be.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  Well, it's like totally believe it.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  It's like a response of HTML breakpoint where you're basically the OS is saying, look, we say that this device is big enough that it can handle two things at once.
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:18.000]  And then the apps go, all right, I'll put that up there then, because the apps are already thinking about sort of like when is it too small?
[1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  I mean, iOS developers already are thinking of this.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  When is it too small?
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  When is it too big?
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  I've got this one design for iPads and one for iPhones, and it's not that unreasonable to think.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  But it's an interesting idea, because then you've got this phone that's sort of like a phone when it's being held in one direction and sort of like an iPad when it's held in another direction.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  And I do, I wonder about the market for this device, because when I talk to people who've written about or use fablets, this is what comes up a lot of the time, is people like it because they don't really care that it's huge, they don't really use it as a phone.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  You know, that word again, a, you know, hello, how's it going, how are the Yankees doing?
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Right, because you do, and immediately, let's just get out of the way you look ridiculous talking on one of these.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  But if you always talk on your phone using a headset or, you know, like I never hold my phone to my ear anyway, I've always got headphones in.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  And so it doesn't matter.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  And if you've got a Bluetooth thing, it doesn't matter.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  And then otherwise you've got the cellular connected internet thing, and it's bigger so the screen is bigger and you can see all stuff.
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  And don't, just don't even underestimate the fact that, you know what?
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  If you're only on the phone for two minutes, who cares if you look ridiculous, you know, get used to it.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Because it's like I said, I think it was with a Hockingberry last week.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  I was like, you know, people do, I've gotten over making fun of them, but people do look ridiculous using an iPad as a camera.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  But guess what?
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  There's like probably two million people right now as we speak using an iPad somewhere in the world as a camera.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  And get over it.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  That's just what they do, you know?
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  Yeah, because they're, it's the tool that's at hand, and it works for them and it fits into their lives.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  And it's hard to talk about Hockingberry about any of this stuff because, you know, it's huge that this would be a nicely dainty phone for him.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Yeah, he's finally going to know what we thought he's going to be so happy.
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  He's going to be like, oh my God, this has been like for you guys.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  Yeah, because right the current phone, he like just kind of holds between two fingers.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  And it's like, what does this look like?
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  It's like, the current phone for him is like what we were talking about using the the iPod nammer.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  And you get your big, meaty fingers on this thing.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  So yeah, he'll be.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  No, you know, I was certainly a skeptic, you know, at first when the Android phones got super big.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  Because it didn't, I didn't see the appeal.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  But, you know, I turned around and they even when I wrote my iPhone five review two years ago, I said,
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  look, the big bigger phones are here to stay because I was skeptical, even when I had it and reviewed it of the change from 3.5 to 4.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Yeah.
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  But clearly, you know, there's desire for it.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:46:00.000]  I'm still a little interested in why they went to two bigger sizes rather than keeping the four in size and having one bigger size.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  Well, I think I think there's a question about what if this is true, what happens next year because I do wonder if at some point.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  They abandon the smaller size, the five size, or do they keep that size around and upgrade that size with better hardware on the inside and sort of end up with.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  Because I think we're going to end up with three sizes because they'll keep around some version of the five as their third product.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  That's the question is, is that a viable size going forward?
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  Because that would be kind of nice if they said, no, we're going to keep that size around and it's never going to be our biggest newest hottest thing.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  We'll keep it around with the previous year specs or whatever, put into it and we've got three sizes now.
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  Not two and the old model, but three iPhone sizes.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  Right.
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  Even though there doesn't seem to be one new one of that size coming this year.
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  But I don't necessarily need to do that.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  I mean, they could put five S and keep it around and it's perfectly good or put a colorful shell on it.
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  And it's the five SC or whatever.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  I mean, they could totally do that if they wanted to or just keep the five C.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  But I do think I'm predicting that the message on stage Tuesday is going to be 4.7 is better than 4.0 for the size that you're used to now.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  And you're going to think it's big at first, but trust us, you'll get used to it.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  And this is the right size.
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  And we've done it now because we can build bigger screens and we have bigger batteries.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  And that whether it's true or not, we won't know until we get to use them.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  But they're going to say, I think they're going to pitch the 4.7 as, you know, yes, it's bigger, but a bigger only in good ways.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  And then they're going to say the 5.5 is an altogether different experience.
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  It's for people and they'll tell a story about who it's for.
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  And you got to credit a company like Samsung.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  I can't believe I'm saying it, but follow me here.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Apple is a company that picks its spot.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  And they looked at the bell curve and said, this is the right size phone.
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  This is like if we could only make one, this is the one because this is going to fit best.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  And what Samsung did because this is what Samsung does is they made a phone like every size possible.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  Just to see what would happen.
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  And one of the things they discovered, it's like a scientist like looking for a planet, like an exoplanet, right?
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Where you're looking at data and you're trying to find some signal in the noise.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  And I feel like what what Samsung did was look at that chart and say, well, okay, people like phones,
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  there's a bump around where the iPhone is and there's a bump above it.
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  People do like the bigger screens.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  And then there's this weird thing that happened over here with the note, which is there's another market for that.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  And it's not as big a market as that smaller phone.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  It's not.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  It's a weird market.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  It's more of a niche, but it's a big niche.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  It's bigger than we thought.
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  And that is something that maybe, you know, until somebody tried it, nobody would know.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  And to Samsung's credit with the note, they tried it and they found it out.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  And it's led everybody else to realize, oh, you know what?
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  It's weird and not what we thought, but some people just want to have the huge phone.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  And so Apple going into that market doesn't necessarily mean it's Apple's failure,
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  because I do think Apple strategy all along was like, look, we're going to pick the size.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  And then later we'll deal with spreading out the product line.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  It is, at least in part, because Samsung went there and uncovered this market that was unexpected.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  And, you know, Apple, because Apple's already got the iPad and the iPad mini,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Apple's not in a bad position to try that now that they are spreading it out.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  They would never make that their only phone, but adding it in.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  It's just, none of us looked at that.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  I mean, we all laughed at the note, right?
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  It's like, why would you do this?
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And it turns out some, it works for some people.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  So here we are.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  It's a full credit to Samsung for, you know, doing the old t-shirt canon,
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  just covering the whole landscape and figuring it out.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  Well, they certainly, they certainly had the first big ones that were hit.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  But I remember noting, I don't know, three years ago,
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  when a lot of Android phones started going past the five-inch mark, right?
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Because in between four and five was bigger than the iPhone,
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  but I played with those devices.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  And yeah, you noticed it was bigger, but it didn't seem huge.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  And then five to me is the marker where once you're past five,
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  that's a really big device.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  And a bunch of Android phones went over there.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  And the thing that I always noticed is that they didn't have four-inch models too.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  They only had the big ones.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  And I believed that my theory then,
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  and I still think it was true at the time,
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  was that for a lot of them, they did it because it was the only way
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  they could get a reasonable battery life.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And the screens weren't super high-res either.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  They made them big, and they weren't super high-res.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  I mean, they weren't necessarily bad.
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  But it just didn't seem to be a lot.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I just, the fact that they didn't have iPhone-sized ones,
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  even though the iPhone was by far and still is the most popular size,
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  smartphone or phone, if I'm going to follow my own advice.
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  It just seemed to me that they had to go big.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  And the reason I could think that they had to go big is that they needed the battery.
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  But then I think a side effect of that, as Android evolved to software-wise,
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  you know, take advantage of that.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  Because the other thing too, the first ones, they just blew the Android interface up.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  It was just, you know, an interface that was kind of designed for the original size
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Android's, which were about the iPhone size.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  And they just blew it up.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  And I think that might be too, where Samsung does,
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  I can't believe I'm saying it, does deserve the credit where I think that the reason like the note was popular
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  was that the note had software that was meant to be on a 5.5-inch screen.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Right, it had their older crazy stylist stuff, right?
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Because they stuck a stylist on it.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Right, and it hit a segment of the market that wanted it.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  And it was a different segment, you know, and it's a totally reasonable thing.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  So I do think factor one is, yes, there are some people.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  Side enough of them that it's a market worth going after,
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  who really and truly want a bigger phone for whatever the reason doesn't matter.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Whether it's for games, whether it's because they watch a lot of TV, you know, video,
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  YouTube on the phone.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  And undeniably, if you're watching YouTube or baseball games, in our case, on a phone,
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  the bigger the screen, the better.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  No doubt about it.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  Maybe it's like big businesses also have come to them and said,
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  you know, we want to buy units for all of our people who are in the field.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  And we want it to be big and full featured because we're not going to get them a tablet.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  We want them out there without a tablet, without a laptop.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  They're going to have one and we want it to be bigger.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  And Apple listens to those guys and says, oh, wow, there's a sale opportunity there too.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  I don't know.
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  It almost doesn't matter why you can almost just subtract it and say,
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  look, there's a bunch of people who want a bigger screen for these reasons.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  And so they get the bigger screen.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  And secondarily, and I think this is huge.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  I would not be surprised if this is a big part of the message on Tuesday,
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  is that making the phone that big.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Yes, there's all sorts of other tradeoffs with one-handed use, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  But all of a sudden, you've got this enormous room to put a battery.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  And so there's like a battery team at Apple.
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  And you know that these guys, and they've even been featured in the videos.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  You know, like when they've talked about the reasons why they've stopped making
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  replaceable batteries and MacBooks and stuff like that.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  And taking every single bit of space that they can get to put more battery in there
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  and smarter batteries.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  There is a team at Apple that works on iPhone batteries.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  And when they were told, okay, here's how big we're going to make this phone.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  They were like, oh my god, that's so beautiful.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  Right.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Well, this is the greatest day of my life.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  I feel like those guys are doing an algebra problem and have been from the beginning
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  that they've been solving for what Apple considers sort of like optimal battery life.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  And that that if you've noticed over the years with the iPhone,
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  the battery life doesn't change very much.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  And obviously the capacity changes a lot.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  And the energy consumption of the device changes a lot.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  But in the end, what they quote as battery life doesn't change very much.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  And so it's very clear to me that they're, they're solving for that battery life.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  Like that's what the number we want to hit.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  That's acceptable battery life.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  And people who really use and abuse their phones say it's not enough.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  And I've got to have a backup battery or I've got to put it in a case.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  Apple's like decided this is, this is what we can fit as a balance that works for us.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  With these new phones being larger and especially the very large one,
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  that's one of my questions is, is this, do those battery guys say,
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  finally we can do, we can, we can also address this other issue, which is,
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  if you want your iPhone to last for two days or a day and a half or whatever it is,
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  twice what it can now, this model will be able to do that.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  That's what, and I think that's, I don't know if it's going to be twice,
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  but I do think it's going to be something like, hey, this bigger,
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  maybe they won't tell us how much this particular number.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  But it's not going to be another 10 hour battery, right?
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  Presumably.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  Right. No, and I think, so I think the 4.7 inch one will come out with iPhone
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  as we know it like battery life.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Right.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  They'll solve for that number again.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Right.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  And the five will use the same amount of energy for everything else
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  because I think it's going to have the same CPU, same camera,
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  same everything else, except this bigger screen,
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  which I also expect to be even higher resolution.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  And so I think they can do that and have it only consume,
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  maybe like 20% more of power, maybe 30% more power,
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  then the 4.7 inch ones screen.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  But they're going to have way more than 20 or 30% more room for battery.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Right.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Because the way more.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  Just the volume, when you do the math of volume of one of these devices,
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  and you add that much screen, I mean, it doesn't seem like a lot,
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  but when the other dimensions are so small,
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  you add that extra screen, and the volume is just vastly larger.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Right.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  And so when people have said, you know, like,
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  and disputing my projections on the displays of the two phones,
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  well, if the one goes 3x, the other one has to go 3x.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  And I think one of the big reasons that it can't,
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  because you can find a 3x resolution for the 4 that would solve all the other problems
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  I brought up about the tap target sizes and the scaling factors
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  and showing more content, you can definitely do it.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  The problem is that one would take 20% more power.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  And then I'll have more room for the battery.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And to have no more 0% more room for the battery.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And I think, though, maybe they'll get there eventually,
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  you know, just through the way that everything gets more efficient over time.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  But I feel like right out of the gate, side by side,
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  one of the main features of the bigger the 5.5-inch iPhone
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  is going to be amazing battery life, at least amazing by the standards of iPhones as we know them.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  And so I think that actually is going to create a second class of people
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  who want the 5.5-inch iPhone.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  I agree.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  First class is who we said before.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  People who want the bigger screen, even if they had the same battery life.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  Even side by side, they both get 10 hours of battery life.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  Well, a whole bunch of people want the 5.5.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  But I think the second class is if it gets 18 hours of battery life instead of 10.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  Yep.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  There will be people who get it and they'll say, damn, this thing is big.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  I don't like this.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  This is big.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  But wow, I need this battery life because they live on their phones.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  And they'll be willing to put up with it.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  And that might be why they're putting in like a one-handed mode, right?
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  Because there's I think there's to me just, you know,
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  sucking all these last minute rumors in, that to me makes sense
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  that maybe there's a one-handed mode only on the 5.5-inch phone.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  I don't think the 4.7-inch phone will need it.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  I think they're going to maybe even if this is all true,
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  they'll even say the 4.7-inch phone doesn't need it.
[1:57:46.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  And we know it's bigger.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  We know it's a little harder to use with one hand, but you could definitely still do it.
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  The 5.5-inch one, you can't.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:54.000]  And if that's what you want to do, here's how you do it.
[1:57:54.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  But I think the battery life is going to draw people in who otherwise
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  would never have bought the 5.5-inch one.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  I think that's going to be part of the story.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  It's like, you want more screen, you want bigger battery life,
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  all these things, we have a model for you now.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Here it is.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  And that may also speak to that business scenario.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  I've got somebody out on the road and I want to send them there with one device.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And it's got 17-hour battery on top of it.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  So this is it.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  You take this out in the field, you, whatever you are,
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  cable repairman, or whoever, oil industry guy,
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  or whatever those enterprises exist.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  So that's another market for it.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  Because otherwise, if all that they're selling is well,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  bigger screen, whatever, it's less compelling.
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  But the battery is one of the very easy bits of math to do
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  and say, well, you're going to have more room for battery.
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  And the components are not going to be larger.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  So of course, there's going to be more battery.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Yeah, I think that that one device angle
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  is a huge part of the five point whatever inch phone
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  craze, that it's for people who don't want to have a tablet
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:06.000]  or don't even want to take a notebook, a MacBook
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  and a phone with them.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  Maybe it's not the only computing device in their life,
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  but maybe it's a desktop computer somewhere sitting on a desk
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  and a five point five inch phone, and that's it.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  And if you're, they're away from the desk,
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  you know, where they can run Photoshop, you know, or Xcode
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  or something like that, that truly needs,
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  still needs like a real Mac.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  Everything else, one device.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  Right.
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  And I think that's exactly what this device is supposed to be.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  I mean, it's great if you're somebody like us
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  who's got an iPhone and iPad and a laptop.
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  But I do talk to people who say,
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  I'm not going to have a tablet and a phone, right?
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:51.000]  Especially since the tablet isn't, isn't subsidized.
[1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  So they've got an iPad, but it's an iPad too.
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  And they don't know when they're going to replace it and all,
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  but they get a new phone every other year, right?
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  So for them, this is a better deal potentially.
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  If it can fulfill what they would use a tablet for,
[2:00:07.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  enough for them to get by without needing the tablet,
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  and it could.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  It's possible.
[2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Yeah.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  And I think it, you know, in terms of any kind of skepticism
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:21.000]  because, ah, but this, what you guys are trying to tell me
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  that Apple's going to make it easier for someone
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  to not buy both an iPhone and an iPad.
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  That doesn't make any sense.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  Of course, they want them to, you know,
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  they're a capitalist company.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  I think it just gets back to that whole lack of fear
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  of cannibalization in Apple,
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  where as long as you're talking about not buying
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  a second Apple product, but you're still buying
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  an Apple product, you're double thumbs up from Tim Cook to you.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  As opposed to somebody who's buying a Samsung Galaxy,
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  whatever, that's 5.5 inches because that's when it's a problem,
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  when it's not an Apple device.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:59.000]  I also think there's the confidence in knowing
[2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  that this is a niche market.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  This is not the mainstream.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  They're going to sell more of the smaller phones
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  and they're going to sell more iPads.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  They're not going to, the most common scenario
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  is not going to be, everybody stops buying iPads
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  and small iPhones and buys some giant iPhone.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  They know that's not going to happen.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  And so this audience is not being served by them right now
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  or it will not be served well by them.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:25.000]  Right. And I think that they have confidence
[2:01:25.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  from decades, you know, multiple decades of the Mac
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  that a wide range of form factors and price ranges
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  is just fine and doesn't necessarily cannibalize anything.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  You know, that the fact that there is an $899 MacBook Air
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  which is an excellent computer.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  Doesn't mean that the 27 inch iMac is going away.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  Well, and actually something that brings up too
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  is I don't know what they're going to name these things,
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  but I've started to think of the iPhone
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  and think of it a little bit like the Mac,
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  which is I'm not entirely sure that they won't just say
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  these are the iPhone 6 or whatever,
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:07.000]  and that there's a big one and a small one.
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  I mean, I'm not 100% convinced that's true,
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  but I've had people tell me, well, of course
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  they're going to have different names.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  And I think, well, MacBook Air comes in two sizes.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  MacBook Pro comes in two sizes.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  iMac comes in two sizes.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:21.000]  The iPhone could come in two sizes
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.000]  without them calling one of them iPhone mini or iPhone huge.
[2:02:25.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  And it would be fine.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  It's the new iPhone and you can get the big one of the small one.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  I don't know whether they'll do that or not, but they could.
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  Yeah, I think the, and it's funny too,
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  I'm terrible at predicting the names.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  I am so bad.
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  I guess I should go on a record and make a prediction,
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  but if I had to, my prediction would be
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  that the 4.7 inch one would be called the iPhone Air,
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  or iPhone 6 Air, but that to me is already a mouthful.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:53.000]  So I say drop the numbers and say iPhone Air,
[2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  and the big one is the iPhone Pro.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  Ah, and I don't like it.
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.000]  I don't like it in a couple of reasons, though,
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  because one reason I don't like it is I do think
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  they're going to have the same performance,
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  like a performance.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  And does that make sense to have Air and Pro
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  that pro somehow feels like it ought to be faster?
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  But I don't know.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  But I just feel pro because they've used it before,
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  and it's more expensive.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  It sounds like it should be more expensive.
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  Yeah, I don't know if the iPhone can be pro.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  Maybe.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Well, the thing I can't see them doing is picking
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  some adjective that means big.
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  No, no, it doesn't.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  It doesn't.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  I mean, I joked about iPhone huge, but it's a terrible.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  I mean, you can't.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  No, if I had to make a bet,
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  I would probably bet that they're just going to call them
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  the iPhone 6 and there's two models.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  Right.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  But it wouldn't.
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  What size do you want?
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Yeah, but it wouldn't shock me if it was the iPhone 6
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  and the iPhone Air, or if it was.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  No, but because they're never going to prioritize the big one
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:53.000]  because the big ones, the niche products,
[2:03:53.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  it would be the iPhone 6 or Air.
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  And then I just have a hard time.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  I think the best pro they could do,
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  but I'm inclined to just guess that they're going to say
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  there's two iPhone 6's, which one do you want?
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  Big one of the little one.
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  And then well, and the other thing I've seen people say
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  that the big one will be called the iPhone Air,
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  but I think they're myopic because they're only.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  Doesn't make it easy.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  Doesn't make it.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  What you're looking at,
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  what they're looking at, they're looking at the iPad's
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  where the bigger iPad is the Air.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  That's true.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Right.
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  But the other one has a name called the mini,
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  which puts it in order.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  And the Air is really kind of, it's sort of an in joke
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  or not in joke, but it's like a reference to all previous iPads
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  where it's so much lighter than the iPad used to be.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  And they're never going to call the mainstream iPhone,
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  the iPhone mini.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  That's kind of crazy.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  No.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  And they can't call one that's 4.7 inches the mini
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  because it's bigger, it's bigger, it's way bigger,
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  it's significantly bigger, maybe not way bigger,
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  but significantly bigger than any iPhone ever made.
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  Right.
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  So they can't say, here's this new 4.7 inch screen,
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  it's significantly bigger, it has a million more pixels
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  and all this shows all this,
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  here's how much more content you see, and it's called the mini.
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:09.000]  No.
[2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Doesn't make it happen.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  I have one more sponsor to read.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  Now I want to get back to that,
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  this thing about us, me and you know in the name.
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  All right.
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  Our last sponsor of the day is our good friends at Transporter
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:23.000]  from connected data.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  So would you like your own private cloud
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  that lets you secure least store and share files
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  in a way that is completely private and resistant
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  to governmental snooping or to any sort of unfortunate things
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  that can happen through the public cloud services,
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  which may or may not have been publicized recently.
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  That's what file Transporter is.
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  You buy a file Transporter from them or more than one.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  It's a device that comes to your home.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  It has a hard drive built into it.
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  You plug it in, you put it on your Wi-Fi,
[2:05:57.000 --> 2:05:59.000]  you install software on your Mac,
[2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  and all of a sudden you have a Dropbox-like folder
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  on your Mac that shows the contents of that device.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  And you put something in the folder and it goes on the device
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  and it's on your hard drive too.
[2:06:11.000 --> 2:06:15.000]  And you can then log into a different computer,
[2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  log into your Transporter account,
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:19.000]  and the same files show up there.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.000]  And then you could buy a second device
[2:06:21.000 --> 2:06:23.000]  and you could put it in a different location
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:25.000]  and you use the same account.
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  And the same files will go from here to there to there.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  But it's only there.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  The data is only on, if you have one file Transporter,
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  that's the only place where your data is
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  other than on your Macs that you log into, your Macs.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  If you have a second one, it'll sync between the two.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:45.000]  The only thing they go through the cloud
[2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  and their servers for is the negotiation to poke holes
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  to set up a peer to peer to poke through the router.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  They don't have any kind of storage in the cloud for your stuff.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  Your stuff is only stored on the devices that you hold in your hand.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  Big difference from cloud-based services.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Really, really appealing to many people.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  And if it appeals to you, I encourage you to check this out
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  because I don't know of any other way to do this
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  than file transporter.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  I have one here.
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  It works like a charm.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Really good stuff.
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  They have two ways to get one.
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:35.000]  The regular file transporter comes with a built-in hard disk.
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  They have 500 gigabyte, one terabyte, two terabyte capacities.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  If you buy one of those, use this code TTS, like the talk show,
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  TTS 10, and you'll save 10% off your purchase.
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  The other way to do it is you can buy the transporter sync.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  That's the one that's like a little Apple TV-sized puck.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  And that one, you just take a USB drive, any USB drive.
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  You already have big hard drive sitting around.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  You want to buy your own hard drives.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  You just buy your own hard drives and plug it in by USB.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  So that's a cheaper gadget because you're supplying your own hard drive.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:17.000]  You can save 20 bucks when you buy one of those with this code TTS 20.
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:21.000]  All orders using either of those codes get free shipping.
[2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  So use those codes.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  Buy the one you want.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  Here's where you go, file transporterstore.com.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  www.filetransporterstore.com.
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  And remember those codes, TTS 10, and TTS 20.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:41.000]  So wrapping up the show.
[2:08:41.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  We've been going a long time, but there's lots to talk about.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  But here's the thing.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  I am inundated this week, more than any other previous Apple event,
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  with people who think that I've already got a watch.
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  I've already got an iPhone.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  That's not how it works, folks.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  I certainly has never worked that way with me.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  It's certainly never worked that way with anybody who I know,
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  like my friends like you and the industry.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  And it's also, to my knowledge, never worked that way for anybody.
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  No, not before they announce it.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  Not before they announce it.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  They just don't do that.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  Like, you know, the whole point of the announcement
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  is they don't want anybody including us to see it.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  And in fact, the reason they invite us to the event
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  is that they want us to see it for the first time,
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  specifically the way that they're going to do it,
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  whether it's going to be projected on a screen,
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  or it's going to come out of a pedestal in the middle of the floor.
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  I think that was at the iPhone 5.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  Yeah, they've used that trick a couple of times.
[2:09:45.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Right.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  But, you know, whatever it is, they're smoke, whatever.
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  Right, but I know, and I don't know a lot about how they prep the keynotes.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  I don't know, you know, they're very secretive just about the whole process,
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  but I do know that they go out like Phil Schiller and everybody else who's there.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  We'll go out to like seats in the room and like do it again.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  And I want to see what it's like from here, you know,
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  and then when Steve Jobs was, was around, you know,
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  that he would go out. He would go out and sit in the audience
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  and see, you know, that that's how we find out this stuff, you know.
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  We definitely don't know the names.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  And I think my track record over the years of predicting product names
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  should prove that.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  And if we did know, we wouldn't be able to make predictions.
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  Right, that's true.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  That's true.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  And the fact that we do make predictions shows how little we know.
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  Right.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  And if somebody whispers something to me who's not, you know,
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  feeding it to me officially on any official capacity,
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  which is always accompanied by, what would you call it,
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  the non-disclosure agreement. Right.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  Like when you do get embargo or an NDA.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Right. I don't know, you know, I read it.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  I try to skim over it. But like when we do get like a review unit
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  before, after it's been announced, always after.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  Right.
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  It's been announced.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  But before it's available in stores, it's, there's a thing that says
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  here, you know, and like for example, you know, the,
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  usually it's like the last couple of years, there's a iPhone event on
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  Wednesday, and people who get reviewing it, you sign a thing.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  And it says the embargo is until 6 p.m. Pacific the next
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  Wednesday. And then the fact that at 601 Pacific,
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  the next Wednesday, there's 30 stories.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  Yeah, everybody gets posted. Yep.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  Right. That's not a coincidence.
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  That's because it's everybody has agreed to that, you know,
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  and nobody knows anything before that.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  And nobody is allowed to publish anything after they know it before
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  that date.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  It's, it, it works.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  It's, it's a lot more obvious how it works than you think.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  There is no secret cabal of people who are filled in before the event.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  No, because then what you'd get is you'd get your David
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Pogue or Walt Mossberger, whatever, writing a story about the
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  product, the moment the product got announced.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  And that doesn't happen.
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  I mean, back like when that, that, the iMac with the flat panel
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  screen in the arm got a leaked by Time magazine, right?
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  I mean, that, they used to do it back then, but they don't,
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  they don't do it anymore.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  They haven't done it for more than a decade.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  Right. And I do think, you know, and, and part of it is just
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  their, their go-to market strategy.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  I mean, you know, my eyes are open.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  I mean, I know that that's part of it is that if the thing is
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  announced on a Tuesday, and then the embargo date is eight days later on
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  a Wednesday, and then the thing actually goes on sale two days later
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  Friday, that that's all according to the schedule of what they think
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  maximizes interest in the people who on Friday will go and,
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  and, you know, fork stuff over.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  Exactly.
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  But I also do think though that part of that too, though, is,
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  is that they really do want reviewers to have to spend a week
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.000]  with the device before they write it.
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Yeah.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  That they don't want reviewer, you know, they, they wouldn't want you to write
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  a review to, to race, you know, okay, you can hear, here's your, here's your
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:15.000]  new iPhone, you can write your review whenever you want.
[2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  I don't think they would do that.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  That happened to me with the first iPad, and that was the worst, because
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  they announced that, and then they did their event saying it was
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  going to ship.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:27.000]  And there were embargo reviews that dropped, and I wasn't part of that,
[2:13:27.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  but then I got one basically the day the embargo reviews dropped
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  or the next day, and I said, is there any embargo, and they're like,
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  no, and it was the worst, because I could literally write about it
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:41.000]  immediately, but I hadn't spent any time with it.
[2:13:41.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  Right.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  And I, that's awful, because you feel time pressure, and yet you can't actually
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  invest the time, or you have to invest the time while everybody is shouting
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  at you to get your story done.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  So the luxury of having eight days to think about this product is great
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  as a writer, but it also means, as Apple, that you were, you know,
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  these writers that you've hand selected are going to be writing about it.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  They're going to have time to think about it, and they're not going to do a
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  cheap job on it.
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  They're going to, they're going to, like, put a lot of effort into it.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  Right.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:17.000]  And it's not like within your case that the boss was breathing down your neck,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  like, if you got to publish it.
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  But you, it's just the simple pressure that you know that Macworld's
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  readers are coming to the site, and that they're reloading the home page,
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  like, I can't wait to see what they have to say about it.
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  And 15, you know, 15 people got it and wrote their reviews, and I wasn't
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  in that group, but now I'm in a group of a very small number of people who
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  have the iPad before it's out.
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  And so I've got something that nobody except for that first wave of 10 people
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  has, has gotten their hands on.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  So I, I need to do something with that.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  But what is that?
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  And I have no, no restrictions whatsoever.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  So literally I could just be like, doo, doo, doo, doo, here I am on my iPad,
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  like live update for two days, and nobody wants to read that.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  But you have to make very difficult decisions then, and it's certainly
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  a lot easier to just say, I've got eight days to worry about what I'm going to write.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Yeah, it's hard enough to do a good review in eight days, but it's,
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:18.000]  I couldn't write a review in a way that I try to write reviews in one or two days.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Like, I think back to the original iPhone, right, you know,
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  it was, I didn't get anything.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  I think only three or four, that was back in the days when only the,
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  the four newspaper guys have to review in it, right?
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  I think it was Stephen Levy at big, poke and mosque work.
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  I guess Levy wasn't at a newspaper.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Newsweek, but he was on the list.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  He knew everybody from covering the iPod.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Yeah.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:40.000]  Right.
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  And it was still the sort of Steve Jobs is, you know, if you're,
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  it's not print, it's not really real and Newsweek.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  Right.
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  I mean, Stephen Levy is, you know,
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  it's a special case because he's awesome and has been around for so long.
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Right.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  But, but the last few years when I haven't had it in advance,
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  I mean, I've, I've made a little agreement with myself like I,
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  I get the phone on the Friday or the Thursday night before the Friday sometimes,
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  but, you know, I get it, I get it basically when people get it.
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  And, you know, my reviews wouldn't run until like Tuesday or Wednesday.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:15.000]  I would basically say I'm going to take the weekend.
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  I'm going to use it.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  I'm going to write.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  I'm going to give it some time because there's no point, all the reviews are that,
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  that we're coming up the day of already came out two days before.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  So I can't beat them.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  And I don't want to write a slap dash one day review.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  There's no point in that.
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  So let me take my time.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  And the people who care about getting the depth later will,
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  will care because I've already missed the weekend.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  And so, and I'm not going to write, write a crappy review.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:43.000]  Yeah.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  Yeah. I remember, it's like, so the first iPhone, you know, I certainly didn't have anything in advance.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  I just got in line, literally waited in line with everybody all day long at the King of Prussian Mall here in Philly.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  And got home at night, had terrible problems activating it.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  It felt like I was ready to die.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:09.000]  And then just banged out my initial thoughts, you know, like, you know, wow,
[2:17:09.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  that's, I can't believe they're using Comic Sans in the notes app, you know,
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  I mean, I was excited.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  And I think I had some interesting first observations.
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  But it was more or less like I was publishing my notes.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  It wasn't that I was writing an article.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  I just published my notes because I couldn't, like, I had to write something.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  I felt not just because I was so excited.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Yeah, that's actually nothing.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  That's actually a really good technique.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  And sometimes I do that too, where it's like, let me give you my notes of, like, first impressions.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  But it's not my review.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  I still need to think about it.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:36.000]  But here's some stuff I noticed.
[2:17:36.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  And then you move.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  Right.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.000]  I guess, yeah, I guess what I'm trying to, yeah, it's one of those things where it's only used,
[2:17:41.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  to me, the only two interesting ways to do it is really, really, here's my notes and my first impressions.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  Or here's something I've taken at least a week to sort of let it permeate.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  Yeah.
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  Totally.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  What do you think of the event venue moving to, to answer college, whatever this,
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  I've never been there.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  I've never been there.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.000]  I didn't go to the iMac event when they held it there.
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  When they introduced the first iMac.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  Yeah, I was all before my time is, you know, before during Fireball was even existed.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And it's mysterious big mystery box up front.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  Nobody even knows what it is.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:21.000]  Nobody even knows if it's a building.
[2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  I mean, some people think it's like, just scaffolding the cover of what's under it.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Yeah, I think this is, I mean, people love the Apple Creme analogy, you know, everybody loves that.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  But I don't know.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  I think one reason is that finding event venues is hard.
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  In the conference center stuff tends to get booked sometimes years in advance.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  So they may have looked for a good Moscone West time and just not found one.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And you're a boy and a theater is too small.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  I think they really wanted to invite a larger crowd.
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  We've, there have been some reports about like fashion industry people invited to.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  It's like at some point they're going to run out of space for the, for the press.
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  And if they can't get Moscone West, the number of venues in the Bay Area that can fit that are limited.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  And then I also know from talking to people at Apple that they've always, you know, they're based in Cupertino.
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  At any time you do an event in San Francisco, there's a lot of overhead in people coming up to the city and you got to get hotel rooms.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  And they're in the city for days at the venue beforehand.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  Right.
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  Because their hours, their hours, their pre-event hours are so crazy.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  They can't afford the back and forth.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  Yeah.
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  Because what is about an hour?
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  It's about an hour.
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  If you get catch traffic well.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  Yeah.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Yeah.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:36.000]  But I mean, yeah.
[2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  Unless you're going through like exactly at the commute, it's the hour-ish between them.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  So you're not shuttling back up and down, especially since a lot of times the night before the event, they're late.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Right.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  Locking it all down.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  Right.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  And so you've got all of your people who are setting up the venue and are going to be participating are off site far away.
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  And that's, you know, it's something that they do with WWDC for instance and any other event they do up in the city.
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  But definitely it's an added bit of a pain that I think they would rather not do.
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  And I'm pretty sure that they're constructing an event space in the new campus that will allow them to just do the events on campus.
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Because town hall is too small too.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  So I think it was close and it's big.
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  And then the structure, my guess is like literally it was close and big, but it didn't have room for hands-on area, briefing rooms, something like that.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  And they're like, you know what?
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  It's better for us to rent this and build a temporary structure than it is to go somewhere else.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  So let's just do it.
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  Well, because remember the one two years ago that was in San Jose.
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  Yeah, the California theater.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  Right.
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  They've done two events there because they did the U2 color iPod.
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  See, I know I wasn't going to events at that time.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  So I missed that one.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  That was a beautiful theater.
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  California theater at San Jose is beautiful.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  A hands-on area was totally a nightmare.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  Exactly.
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  That's exactly what was going.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  The hands-on area was like going up into your parent's attic.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  Well, imagine there's hundreds of people in a space that was like barely big enough for you to go buy some jujubis at the counter.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  It was like here's where they're usually just selling popcorn and you know.
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  Yeah, it didn't it didn't it was it was a nice venue, but there was Apple always likes to have one hands-on area.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  So that the press can get their hands on the stuff and take pictures with Tim Cook coming out and looking at the new stuff.
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  And then they also like to have briefing areas where they can meet with a press.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  And that's where you know, if you're getting an advance unit, that's where you pick it up.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  And you know, that's a big checklist of items.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  And I think there's very few venues like Moscone West will do it.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  But my guess is that Moscone West wasn't available.
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  Or I don't think they ever just had a pure product introduction.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  I can't recall it.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  I think they have.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  I think they have done it where they've literally just taken it for the day.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  But it's a big conference space and they're working on Moscone.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  So it's very difficult to get space and something like that.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  So, yeah, I think it's, I think that that's what I think it's, I'm going to go with a nice simple,
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  Occam's razor explanation that they pick the venue because it has a lot of seats.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:16.000]  And they do want to invite more people.
[2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  Yeah, I mean, they could have taken it to like where the San Jose sharks players.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  Like that giant arena of Apple.
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  No, see, but in theory, they could.
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  But I think they wouldn't because they wouldn't like the acoustic.
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  No, no, it's totally true.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  But that's the difficulty in finding a venue that's like the right size for them.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  That's like conference space and not sporting arena.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  And then I think the big white box is a big white temporary hands on area.
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  Because if they've invited more people, there's going to be a lot more, you know, need for a big one.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  And the last time I tried it in the theater with the tiny little thing, it was actually a very unpleasant hands on.
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  I just, I don't think there's so many people that can get into the Flint Center too.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  So it makes it even worse that like now you've got this big venue.
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  Okay, but then you really need a big hands on area.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  Or you're going to have members of the press waiting for hours to get through the doors by the, you know, get admitted by the fire marshal to get into a space.
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  Right.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  And so you've got a, you know, the math works, as soon as the venue gets bigger, the hands on area has to get bigger.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  Like town hall, they use the little piano lounge across the way.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:28.000]  And that's a tight fit because the town hall is small, the piano lounge is also small and it doesn't fit.
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  Yeah, that's not that pleasant either just in terms.
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  And that's, you know, with the overflow crowd, you know, you know, take however many people and fit in town hall, they may be invited to more.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Yeah.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  And that's, it's just already a couple of people.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  Yeah.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  So I think that's what it is.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  I think it's a hands on there.
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:50.000]  And maybe they also have some like temporary briefing rooms or something in there.
[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:52.000]  Yeah, yeah, probably.
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  And, and maybe they have some stuff to demo that does take more physical space home kit stuff.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  Car play.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  Car play.
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  And, you know, and that all fits in.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  I don't think it's super mysterious though, you know, I don't, I don't think that they've built like a full scale home.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  You know, so I've seen people speculate in that.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  I mean, that's crazy.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  They don't need to do that.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  They did maybe they have some couches and whatever, you know, it.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  I agree with you. I think there's the Occam's razor.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Uh, explanation is the best, which is this was a venue they could get.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  And the one thing it didn't have was space for hands on stuff.
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  So, you know, and when you're playing with, uh, in Apple's league, um, and you're shopping around for venues, you look at the cost of setting up a temporary structure for a week.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  And pencil it in and maybe that's actually as ridiculous as it seems.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  Maybe that's the best deal.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  That's exactly what I think exactly.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  Now, we'll embarrass ourselves.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  Yeah.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  People are listening back.
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:57.000]  They didn't realize they built an entire house under there and it was full of wearable devices.
[2:24:57.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  Right.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:24:59.000]  But I can't wait.
[2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  I can't wait.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  Cause the next time I'm going to see you in two days, you know, less than two days, I will see you.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  I will almost always run into you in the morning outside the event venue.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  Yep.
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  And if they've uncovered it and something else, we could just look at each other.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  We won't even need to talk.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:16.000]  I'll just hide our heads and change.
[2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Yep, exactly right.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  We'll utter a silent apology to talk show listeners.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  Right.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  I'll have to have you right back on as the next episodes guess so that we can apologize.
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  Right.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  What went wrong?
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  Yep.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  Jason Selle, thank you so much for your time.
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  Thanks for having me.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  It was a lot of fun.
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  It's great to be on.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  God, you know, I just, your voice is like butter on a podcast.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  A podcast that needs butter, hopefully.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  Well, you know, you know, you do a lot of podcasts.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  I do.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  I may have a problem.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  You and Renee, you guys get a lot of podcasts.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And plus, you've got overcast in your doc.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  So you're listening to a lot of podcasts.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  But I hear your voice in my headphones a lot.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  And I usually don't get to talk back to it.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  And it's, it's been a pleasure.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Likewise.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  I'll see you Tuesday morning.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  I'll see you Tuesday.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  Thank you.
