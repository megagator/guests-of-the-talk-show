[00:00.000 --> 00:01.120]  Is it cold up there?
[00:01.120 --> 00:07.520]  Yeah, damn cold. It was like minus 27 today, which is minus 16 for you guys. It's cold.
[00:07.520 --> 00:13.200]  Like, when it gets double-digit cold, the scale doesn't matter at that point. It's cold.
[00:13.200 --> 00:16.800]  When it gets to the point where the Celsius and Fahrenheit numbers converge?
[00:16.800 --> 00:19.280]  Yeah, yeah. You're in trouble. You're in real trouble.
[00:19.280 --> 00:19.780]  Yeah.
[00:21.440 --> 00:24.320]  Kelvin starts looking. Is that, like, the real number? Yeah.
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.040]  So I get...
[00:27.040 --> 00:30.000]  It's one of the reasons I wanted to have you on. You haven't been on in a while. You're a good
[00:30.000 --> 00:34.400]  friend. I have stuff I want to talk to you about. But I also thought, this is great. I will have
[00:34.400 --> 00:41.440]  Guy on, and he's up there in Canada, and therefore I will not be tempted to complain about how cold
[00:41.440 --> 00:42.480]  it is in Philadelphia.
[00:43.680 --> 00:45.920]  It's probably pretty cold. What's it down there?
[00:45.920 --> 00:48.400]  It's 27 as we speak, but it has been...
[00:48.400 --> 00:49.760]  Oh, that's not so bad.
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.560]  That's Fahrenheit, of course, but it has been down in the teens,
[00:54.560 --> 00:57.200]  and I think it was, like, 13 when I woke up this morning.
[00:58.080 --> 01:02.720]  And just outside the city, like, an hour, my dad said it was 9. That's really cold.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.560]  That is... that's, yeah, legit pretty cold. It's funny, because you... I don't know if you want
[01:08.560 --> 01:12.080]  to go behind the curtain on this, but it's Saturday, and you texted me this morning,
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.560]  like, hey, dummy, you're doing it on a good day. And I'm like, well, between COVID and
[01:17.440 --> 01:22.640]  the heat death of the universe outside, no, I'm staying in. So more than happy to chat
[01:22.640 --> 01:25.840]  with you about whatever the hell comes up. How are you being, man? What have you been up to?
[01:25.840 --> 01:28.400]  Because it has been a while. When's the last time we spoke?
[01:28.400 --> 01:31.840]  Well, we speak a lot, but I think the last time you were on the show,
[01:31.840 --> 01:37.360]  at least according to Skype, which ridiculously I'm still using, that was November 2019,
[01:37.360 --> 01:40.080]  but I think we did a Star Wars show somewhere in there.
[01:40.080 --> 01:45.600]  I feel like we did, yeah. Yeah. And yeah, we text a lot, and I don't know.
[01:45.600 --> 01:48.800]  I don't like speaking on the phone, and you're one of the few people that I do,
[01:48.800 --> 01:51.840]  and it's every few months kind of thing. Like, it's pretty rare.
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.920]  But one thing I realized, I got engaged, and I haven't spoken to you about that.
[01:55.920 --> 01:56.560]  Congratulations.
[01:57.200 --> 02:04.320]  Yeah. Let's just air all of her personal stuff on your show. Yeah, she's awesome. Amanda,
[02:04.320 --> 02:08.480]  if you know her. So yeah, that's some personal news. Anyway, good catching up.
[02:08.480 --> 02:11.440]  You didn't ask my opinion in advance, but I approve.
[02:11.440 --> 02:14.960]  I don't know what I... Honestly, I can't imagine you not approving.
[02:14.960 --> 02:18.000]  If anything, you'd call her up and be like, look, you may want to think this one over.
[02:18.000 --> 02:23.600]  Yeah, well, let me see here. I don't know when the hell you were on. Anyway.
[02:23.600 --> 02:26.640]  It was a while. Yeah, because we get together with Syracuse every now and then and have a
[02:27.200 --> 02:32.000]  holiday party. Well, we have a holiday party, and Jon suffers with us as we talk Star Wars.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.840]  Well, he's either in a permanent holiday party, or he's never in a holiday party.
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.480]  I think he sort of has his own state of enlightenment.
[02:40.480 --> 02:43.280]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I don't mean that in a negative way.
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.280]  Sometimes we tie one arm while talking about Star Wars.
[02:47.280 --> 02:50.400]  Are you a fan of the movie Heat?
[02:51.200 --> 02:55.040]  I think we've spoken about this before. I think the first time I watched it,
[02:55.040 --> 02:58.800]  it turned me off for some reason. Al Pacino goes over the top a lot.
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.440]  Keeps me sharp on the edge where I got to be. Like, I made fun of that. It was so intense
[03:03.440 --> 03:07.760]  and like a little over the top. I have since revisited it a few times, and I love it.
[03:07.760 --> 03:12.480]  It's a great movie. It's worth everybody fawning over it, for sure.
[03:12.480 --> 03:14.960]  I don't know what my initial thing was. It could have just been,
[03:14.960 --> 03:20.720]  you know, to be contrarian in some way, but I don't think so. I just think it hit me.
[03:20.720 --> 03:23.360]  Sometimes, you know, I don't write headspace to watch a certain type of movie.
[03:23.360 --> 03:29.120]  Yes, absolutely. And it's totally different than it is to me. One of the biggest differences
[03:29.680 --> 03:36.000]  between reading a novel or even a comic book and reading like a serious graphic novel or a movie,
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.600]  because a movie you start and you go right through. And if you're not in the right mood,
[03:39.600 --> 03:42.880]  it's no good. Whereas if you start reading a book that you thought was going to be good and
[03:42.880 --> 03:46.800]  you get a couple of pages in and you're just not in the right space, you just go do something else
[03:46.800 --> 03:50.320]  and then you pick up the book the next day and maybe now you're in the mood for it. Whereas
[03:50.320 --> 03:54.880]  a movie could really turn you off. And especially when you see it in a theater, because you've got
[03:54.880 --> 03:58.960]  no chance to pause, right? But you go out on a date or you go with some buddies. Like,
[03:58.960 --> 04:05.040]  I was definitely in college when heat came out, 1995, and I could see that. I had a really good
[04:05.040 --> 04:12.320]  friend in college who, and we were easily upper 90 percentile copacetic on movies we liked and
[04:12.320 --> 04:19.360]  disliked. At least 95%, right? 19 out of 20 movies. We were either thumbs uping or thumbs
[04:19.360 --> 04:24.960]  downing the exact same movies and wildly disagreed on heat. He was like, I cannot believe that movie
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.240]  was terrible, interminable, didn't like it. And. Wait, this was you thinking that or your friend?
[04:30.240 --> 04:33.040]  No, my friend, my friend Don. And I couldn't believe it. Cause I thought,
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.600]  did I just see the best movie I've ever seen in my life?
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.760]  Yeah. Yeah. I think my reaction was that it was, so I saw it in the cinema too. I think
[04:41.760 --> 04:47.680]  somehow something tweaked me in one of the earlier scenes with Pacino, who I respect a lot,
[04:47.680 --> 04:53.440]  but you got to admit he's a big actor, a big presence in the scene. And I think once that
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.080]  was in my head, things started to go downhill a little bit. Once you've killed Juan, you may not
[04:58.080 --> 05:00.400]  may as well just go keep killing them all. He says in the movie?
[05:00.400 --> 05:05.840]  Yeah. It's when the shooting starts in late, they're like, well, once you've popped one guard,
[05:05.840 --> 05:10.160]  they just keep, they get into a massive gunfight because, you know, whatever. You're up for one,
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.960]  you may as well just go for it. And I think what I loved or what I was, what was happening to me
[05:14.960 --> 05:19.600]  in the movie was that it is incredibly well-made. It is a beautiful movie. It's tense. It's awesome.
[05:20.160 --> 05:24.960]  And I felt a bit like Pacino was a Muppet. And he's obviously not, I've seen it since,
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.840]  but I think something in my head just got twigged such that his little, little
[05:31.120 --> 05:38.080]  semantic tics just were heightened for me. And so I went away, but I felt the same thing about
[05:38.080 --> 05:42.880]  Fight Club, which I have again, since we visited, cause I know Amy loves it. I remember having this
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.680]  conversation with Amy and she, I don't know if it was her advance, like whoever, people talking
[05:47.680 --> 05:53.920]  into going to see it again and it is great. I like it again. So I don't know. It's sometimes,
[05:53.920 --> 05:57.440]  like you're saying, the way you consume media depends on sort of the preconditions,
[05:57.440 --> 06:01.360]  like your starting point rather than the actual thing that you're trying to experience.
[06:01.360 --> 06:07.280]  Yeah. The one thing I read, well, a couple of points on Heat, I would say that
[06:07.840 --> 06:15.200]  Pacino and De Niro, roughly the same age, came to be celebrated actors in the seventies,
[06:15.200 --> 06:22.800]  in the same era, worked with a bunch of the same directors and just were both in The Godfather II,
[06:22.800 --> 06:27.680]  but of course never had scenes together because De Niro played young, what's the name of the
[06:27.680 --> 06:33.040]  Godfather himself? The old Corleone? Don Corleone. Yeah, but what the hell was his name? Michael?
[06:33.040 --> 06:36.480]  No, what was Don Corleone? Well, whatever, he played the same character.
[06:36.480 --> 06:44.000]  Speaking of Syracuse, he is furious at us right now. Sorry, John. Yeah.
[06:45.680 --> 06:52.640]  But he was playing young Don Corleone in the turn of the century and Pacino, of course,
[06:52.640 --> 06:56.480]  is Michael Corleone in the fifties, so of course they had no scenes together.
[06:56.480 --> 06:59.360]  Vito Corleone, of course, was the name. Vito. Thank you.
[06:59.360 --> 07:05.760]  His young Vito. And they both played throughout their whole careers, crazily,
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.120]  widely different characters, incredible actors. Part of the beauty of Heat is they were still
[07:11.120 --> 07:15.920]  at the peak of their careers and now they're finally going to be on screen together.
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.160]  But one big difference between the two, and I think everybody agrees, is that
[07:20.160 --> 07:27.360]  Pacino went in a certain direction where he's, in the later decades of his career,
[07:27.360 --> 07:31.920]  seems to always be playing some variation on the Al Pacino guy. And it's a guy who
[07:31.920 --> 07:38.960]  nobody else can play, but anybody who can do, like a comedian who can do impressions,
[07:38.960 --> 07:43.600]  can do an Al Pacino, right? And his character in Heat is along those lines.
[07:43.600 --> 07:48.800]  Give me what you got! It could be, yeah, I think that could be it. Like, he is being
[07:48.800 --> 07:54.640]  the most Al Pacino Al Pacino can be. Right, whereas De Niro is totally into this
[07:54.640 --> 08:02.400]  Neil McCauley character who is very different. And it's one of the things that is, one of the
[08:02.400 --> 08:06.800]  things I'm going to is that there's a ringer, the rewatchables podcast that Bill Simmons does,
[08:06.800 --> 08:11.760]  where they just, you know, same thing that we do with Star Wars sometimes is talk for three hours
[08:11.760 --> 08:17.760]  about a two-hour movie. And he brought up, he had one, he's actually done it three times with Heat,
[08:17.760 --> 08:22.240]  but in the third one, he mentioned that a month before Heat came out, Casino came out.
[08:22.240 --> 08:27.840]  And just coincidentally, another big famous movie that stood up to the test of time,
[08:27.840 --> 08:32.640]  Robert De Niro's in it, totally different character. It's okay. You can see that,
[08:32.640 --> 08:36.240]  you know, you can look at him and say, yeah, he looks like Robert De Niro, but
[08:36.240 --> 08:40.560]  holy moly, what a different character. Whereas Al Pacino, you don't really get that, but it's,
[08:40.560 --> 08:46.880]  it, I don't know, I feel that his Vincent Hanna, the detective in Heat, it works. It's like the,
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.240]  it does, but I could see why if you're not in the mood for it, you may not be in the mood.
[08:50.240 --> 08:56.240]  The proximity to Casino may have affected my, I can't remember, I don't know, 95, who knows
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.880]  what the hell was going on in my head, but the proximity to Casino may well have adjusted my
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.400]  expectations for the movie. And that's why he tweaked me a little bit out of it. Sorry,
[09:04.400 --> 09:07.360]  I'll cut you off though. No, that's all right. Well, Heat's on my mind because the other day,
[09:07.360 --> 09:14.320]  last week, I was just scrolling through Twitter and I saw a tweet from Michael Mann, who I don't
[09:14.320 --> 09:19.600]  even recall following. He's not a very frequent Twitterer, but at some point over the years,
[09:19.600 --> 09:23.360]  I'm sure that maybe there's some API to look it up when the hell I first followed
[09:23.360 --> 09:27.440]  at Michael Mann on Twitter, but it seriously might've been like 10 years ago or more,
[09:27.440 --> 09:31.840]  but there was a tweet from Michael Mann and it just said Heat 2 coming in August,
[09:31.840 --> 09:38.480]  and it was a video trailer. And I'm like, what? Whoa. And I like, I couldn't think of a better
[09:38.480 --> 09:43.120]  word. I, as I wrote, when I linked to it on Daring Fireball, I almost plotzed. I got my
[09:43.120 --> 09:49.040]  mind almost popped. And I was like, how is that even possible? And it's not a movie. It's a novel
[09:49.040 --> 09:56.720]  and it's with these co-written with Meg Gardner. It's a novel that is both a prequel and sequel,
[09:56.720 --> 10:01.280]  like half of it takes place 10 years before Heat, half takes place 10 years after.
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.640]  And I'll read it. I don't care. I love the movie so much. And Michael Mann has never done a novel
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.280]  before. So I'm interested to see what he does. And I can so totally see once I think about it,
[10:11.280 --> 10:16.880]  how he wouldn't make a sequel or prequel to it because he'd have to recast roles and maybe you
[10:16.880 --> 10:20.480]  wouldn't want to. Of course, and I don't want to go into Star Wars here and talk about recasting
[10:20.480 --> 10:24.960]  Obi-Wan Kenobi as a young actor and it's, but I could see why he wouldn't want to do it with
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.600]  any of the characters from Heat. You don't want to cast somebody else as Neil McCauley.
[10:29.600 --> 10:32.400]  I don't think you can. I don't think you can.
[10:32.400 --> 10:36.560]  So you could do it in a novel. You could do it in a novel, what you couldn't do on screen.
[10:36.560 --> 10:41.840]  But anyway, the other thing is I think if you try to recast them in order to tell the story,
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.680]  you would be constrained. I think it's an artificial constraint. If you don't recast them,
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.320]  then you're artificially constrained to using them as they are now at that stage in life,
[10:52.320 --> 10:55.840]  which is maybe not the story he wants to tell. So at least by doing it in a book, he can tell
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.080]  whatever story he wants, regardless of the availability of actors or fleshing out the
[11:00.080 --> 11:04.480]  world in a visual way, because he just has to write the actual story he wants. Because it's
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.040]  a very self-contained sort of story. How do you approach that without just making it feel like
[11:09.040 --> 11:12.400]  you're going back to the wealth a little bit? Yeah, I don't know. I'm intrigued. We can talk
[11:12.400 --> 11:17.360]  about it. It's put a pin in it and talk about it at the end of the show, the Star Wars stuff.
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.880]  But Ewan McGregor as young Obi-Wan Kenobi to me was very well cast. And whatever people want to
[11:24.880 --> 11:31.360]  say about the prequel trilogy, which I'm a much bigger fan of, as you and I reiterated
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.600]  numerous times on this show on our Star Wars Holiday Spectaculars, than most people of our
[11:35.600 --> 11:41.040]  generation who seem to give them two thumbs down and hold their nose. I enjoy them for what they
[11:41.040 --> 11:46.800]  are. But to me, one of the highlights throughout all three of them is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan
[11:46.800 --> 11:54.000]  Kenobi. Not that this makes a lot of sense, but he made Kenobi my favorite character, to be honest.
[11:54.000 --> 11:58.720]  He's cool. He's cool in the original trilogy. He's this wise old guy. He knows what he's doing.
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.640]  He gets cut down. He comes back from beyond the grave. That's pretty badass. He gives Luke a
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.400]  little bit of a mindfuck, which is weird. The whole thing where he's lying to him is just kind
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.080]  of weird and makes him interesting. But yeah, Ewan McGregor actually held those movies together
[12:14.080 --> 12:20.240]  for me a bit. I don't think that they're great films, the prequel trilogy, but there's world
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.000]  building and stuff to commend them and things that I like about them. Some of the production
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.640]  design is wonderful. The music's pretty cool. There's cool things about them that I think is,
[12:29.360 --> 12:32.400]  I don't want to say it's hipster to just discover them, but it's too easy to just
[12:32.400 --> 12:37.360]  hate on them. There's interesting stuff there. Take the good stuff, leave the bad and get on
[12:37.360 --> 12:40.720]  with life. All right, here's where I'm going. I'm going to ask you a question and I'll put you on
[12:40.720 --> 12:44.880]  the spot because you haven't prepped, but can you think off the top of your head of any other
[12:44.880 --> 12:52.800]  casting of the same character with a new actor to make the character decades younger or older
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.880]  that you could think of that you were fond of? I have one in mind that was sublime.
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.920]  I do. I've got a couple just immediately. The first one I don't think counts, but it's Spider-Man,
[13:01.920 --> 13:08.080]  the various Spider-Men. This works pretty well, but they're different characters. I don't know
[13:08.080 --> 13:11.520]  if you've seen the most recent one, but maybe I won't get into that, do you?
[13:11.520 --> 13:14.080]  I have not. I have not seen the most recent Spider-Man.
[13:14.080 --> 13:17.040]  Anyway, Bond is good. I really like Daniel Craig as Bond.
[13:17.040 --> 13:21.920]  Yeah, but I'm thinking more that Ewan McGregor,
[13:21.920 --> 13:28.320]  as the same character that Alec Guinness played, or as mentioned before, Robert De Niro playing
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.800]  a young Vito Corleone instead of Marlon Brando. I can't think of one that got de-aged.
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.400]  Honestly, if it was just you and me sitting in a bar, I would waste five minutes trying to do this,
[13:38.400 --> 13:41.600]  but let's move on for the sake of the show. All right, I'm going to tell you who I'm
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.040]  thinking of, and it's a tragedy because we died tragically young, but River Phoenix as young
[13:47.040 --> 14:00.000]  Indiana Jones was unbelievable to me. I remember going to see that movie and had done the best I
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.120]  could at a young age. I forget what year it came out, but I was in high school or very early high
[14:05.120 --> 14:10.320]  school, and it was hard to do the full media block out that I try to do now for movies because TV
[14:10.320 --> 14:18.240]  commercials were unskippable. So I think I knew that he was in it, I guess, but it opens with the
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.440]  sort of hoodwink where there's a guy who you think is Indiana Jones because he's got a leather jacket
[14:23.440 --> 14:30.400]  and a fedora and it's not. But then once you see River Phoenix as young Indiana Jones, he's not
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.080]  just young Indiana Jones, he is totally credible as young Harrison Ford and has the ticks and
[14:36.080 --> 14:44.240]  mannerisms and stuff down in a way that to me, I love Robert De Niro as young Vito Corleone, but
[14:45.520 --> 14:51.120]  as much as I love those scenes in The Godfather II, I never really buy that he's the same,
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.880]  that he is Marlon Brando. I can buy that he's Vito Corleone, but he's not Marlon Brando,
[14:56.880 --> 15:02.000]  whereas River Phoenix to me felt like he was Harrison Ford. Do you think maybe it's because
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.280]  Brando is so Brando in that role? It's big and it's meaty and his mannerisms are very specific
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.320]  to him. I think if De Niro tried to pull it off, it seemed like an impression, which is definitely
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.040]  what you want to avoid. But yeah, River Phoenix killed it. Again, man, when did he pass?
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.800]  PAUL Like 91 or something like that?
[15:20.800 --> 15:21.920]  BRIAN Yeah, it was shocking.
[15:21.920 --> 15:27.200]  PAUL Yeah. Anyway, very sad. Anyway, here's where I'm going with this to bring it back home to us
[15:27.200 --> 15:32.080]  talking about podcasts, is I got excited about Heat. I linked to this novel that's coming out
[15:32.080 --> 15:38.800]  and a couple of people on Twitter pointed me toward this rewatchables episode, which was just
[15:38.800 --> 15:43.920]  a couple months ago in November. It was the third time Bill Simmons had done a rewatchables about
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.200]  Heat. But what made this one in November special was that his guest was Michael Mann himself.
[15:49.200 --> 15:56.560]  PAUL Oh, wow. BRIAN And I was like, oh, I got to get that, definitely. And so I go to overcast and
[15:56.560 --> 16:03.200]  go to the rewatchables, which I don't subscribe to ordinarily. And they only have the most 16 most
[16:03.200 --> 16:09.600]  recent episodes, which goes to the end of November. So it might be like 17 episodes ago was the one
[16:09.600 --> 16:15.120]  that I wanted. If not 17, it must have been 18, as I missed it by the week. And I'm like, whoa,
[16:15.120 --> 16:19.840]  that's weird. And there's a web page for the episode. But now that the whole ringer network
[16:19.840 --> 16:27.840]  was bought by Spotify, the only player on the web page is the Spotify player,
[16:27.840 --> 16:33.440]  which means you could listen to it on the web page without being a Spotify customer or anything.
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.480]  But there's no other way to get a download. Of course, I nerded out a little and actually looked
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.240]  at the RSS feed source code. And that's how I know that there's 16 episodes. But I actually went into
[16:44.240 --> 16:51.120]  the web inspector to look at the Spotify player to see if it was a wrapper around an HTML audio
[16:51.120 --> 16:58.000]  element. And then I could just find it. And it's not. It's like Spotify either purposefully to
[16:59.360 --> 17:07.360]  actually defeat the ability to do this, or through completely 1000% over engineering,
[17:07.360 --> 17:15.840]  seems to load episodes, not through MPPEG3 files and one little snippet at a time.
[17:15.840 --> 17:21.280]  And there is no there even in the dynamic ad insertion purposes. I don't know it's but it's
[17:21.280 --> 17:30.960]  there's no easy way to do it. So I just resorted to brute force, which is I set up a machine and
[17:30.960 --> 17:37.440]  used audio hijack. I can't remember the last time I had to use audio hijack to get a podcast.
[17:38.080 --> 17:43.840]  But I just played the Spotify thing on their web page and use audio hijack to rip it and
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.880]  then uploaded it to overcast as a uploaded file, which worked just fine. I'm halfway through.
[17:48.880 --> 17:53.360]  And it's remarkable. But now here I am telling everybody, if you want to listen to it and you
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.160]  don't use Spotify, you've got to just use audio hijack, I guess to rip it.
[17:58.160 --> 18:04.720]  Well, it worked for a while. When was that? Years ago, early 2000s.
[18:04.720 --> 18:06.320]  Oh, man, that's like when I met you.
[18:06.320 --> 18:11.040]  2000s, I got out of the game business and into max software stuff. Yeah, around 2004.
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.000]  The app that I wrote for them was called Radio Shift. And the notion was that like,
[18:16.000 --> 18:21.200]  not everything was podcast. So it would go and spin up a process in the background and connect
[18:21.200 --> 18:27.200]  to your Windows Media audio file or whatever, like, however weird set of things that we needed
[18:27.200 --> 18:32.080]  to do in order to download something off the radio. And often it was like broadcast
[18:32.080 --> 18:34.800]  live at a certain time. Like it was just the radio fields.
[18:34.800 --> 18:36.720]  Yeah, that was real common back then.
[18:36.720 --> 18:41.440]  Yeah, yeah. And it would go and record them and put them into iTunes as podcast episodes.
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.960]  So I'm amused that you're turning back to audio hijack to do a thing that I actually
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.360]  wrote for them way back in the day. That app got, A, limited use, B, everybody does podcast now,
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.520]  except, I guess, somehow this Spotify weirdness. But yeah, and also it broke my heart because
[18:57.520 --> 19:02.400]  invariably a lot of this, it was support heavy for sure, just because it's so many weird feeds
[19:02.400 --> 19:08.560]  and like Windows Media was big at the time. And to get that properly done, you needed a
[19:08.560 --> 19:12.400]  QuickTime plugin that was also screwed up and it would block the whole stack anyway. A whole bunch
[19:12.400 --> 19:17.040]  of weird and wonderful, annoying stuff. Anyway, great, great company. Those guys are awesome.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.600]  And obviously also a fan of the show.
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.480]  So it's like on the one hand, yeah, Rogue Amoeba is great stuff. And Audio Hijack is
[19:24.480 --> 19:26.720]  just a tremendous tool for doing something like that.
[19:26.720 --> 19:27.120]  Exactly.
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.200]  And you just get like a full fidelity MP3 file and it couldn't be easier. But it makes me feel
[19:33.200 --> 19:39.520]  a little guilty complaining about the fact that the Ringer's podcasts have gone to this sort of,
[19:39.520 --> 19:45.440]  you can listen to all the recent episodes, like a regular podcast using whatever podcast player
[19:45.440 --> 19:51.040]  you want. But if you want any of the archive stuff, you've got to be a Spotify user or
[19:51.040 --> 19:55.040]  sit there and listen to it on a webpage player, which it's like, who wants to do that with an
[19:55.040 --> 19:58.240]  hour and a half podcast? I mean, I guess if you're working and you're listening to podcasts,
[19:58.240 --> 20:03.200]  that's fine. But I'm always listening to podcasts while I'm like walking around doing errands or
[20:03.200 --> 20:07.440]  just chores around the house or something like that. But it made me feel guilty complaining
[20:07.440 --> 20:12.480]  about it because there's a bunch of old episodes of my show that aren't in the feed because of
[20:12.480 --> 20:17.840]  when I first started doing this show on my own and I was at Mule and it's like, I don't know,
[20:17.840 --> 20:24.640]  just like a year or two of episodes. I have them, but they're not in the feed right now. And I feel
[20:24.640 --> 20:29.520]  it's one of those terrible things that I've procrastinated on for literally years. And
[20:29.520 --> 20:35.040]  now I'm motivated to fix it. But in the best episode in that bunch of missing ones is the
[20:35.040 --> 20:40.400]  interview I had with Rian Johnson. Oh man, you're hurting me. You're hurting me. The best one in
[20:40.400 --> 20:46.000]  that set of episodes is the one that we did live on stage at WWDC. Scotty, Scott Simpson was there,
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.760]  Amy was there, Paul was there. That's the best one. But sure, Rian Johnson. You know what though?
[20:52.800 --> 20:56.480]  I have not annoyed with you, but I'd be like, man, I wish I could get that because I've wanted
[20:56.480 --> 21:02.240]  to be listened to that one. It's Adam Lisagor or Powell and Rian Johnson. And that was great. And
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.720]  obviously I haven't heard it in years. Talking about Johnson's Looper, which is one of my
[21:06.720 --> 21:10.480]  favorite time travel movies of all time. Time travel movies, I don't want to go on the whole
[21:10.480 --> 21:16.160]  side. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. Time travel movies are either awesome or utterly
[21:16.160 --> 21:20.560]  terrible. It's almost like impossible to make a mediocre time travel movie.
[21:22.240 --> 21:26.160]  I have very strong opinions about every one and Looper is one of the good ones. But I'm
[21:26.160 --> 21:30.320]  going to fix this. I swear to God, I have all the stuff to do it and I'm going to make it happen.
[21:30.320 --> 21:40.960]  But the other sidetrack, which is nerdy, really nerdy, is that as magical as RSS has been for
[21:40.960 --> 21:48.000]  podcasts, and I wrote about this recently where people were talking about RSS readers and the sort
[21:48.000 --> 21:58.400]  of gestalt out there is RSS readers were a fad 15, 20 years ago amongst the sort of early blogging
[21:58.400 --> 22:03.360]  nerd set. And then when everybody went to Google Reader because it synced and it was the best way
[22:03.360 --> 22:08.160]  to do it. And then Google just said, you know what, we're not interested in this anymore.
[22:08.160 --> 22:13.120]  Google Reader, they pulled the plug and then all of a sudden people stopped reading RSS feeds and
[22:13.120 --> 22:18.720]  RSS is quote unquote dead except for a niche, blah, blah, blah. Whereas it's actually more
[22:18.720 --> 22:24.640]  popular than it's ever been because 99% of all podcasts anybody listened to come through RSS
[22:24.640 --> 22:28.560]  feeds, right? There's Spotify and a few other things that are doing their own proprietary stuff,
[22:28.560 --> 22:31.680]  but even Spotify makes a lot of their shows available as RSS feeds.
[22:32.240 --> 22:37.200]  It's one of those things where the technology becomes such a substrate that it stops being
[22:37.200 --> 22:42.640]  considered the technology and just is considered the thing that's there. Like electricity in the
[22:42.640 --> 22:46.560]  wall, like nobody's obviously the power can go out, but nobody spends a lot of time each day
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.440]  thinking about what a marvel of technology it is when you turn your light switch on.
[22:51.440 --> 22:56.480]  And RSS is like that, it's the carrier platform and it's built on top of HTTP, which again,
[22:56.480 --> 23:00.720]  most people don't think about or TCP IP, which nobody really thinks about until,
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.640]  well, nobody really thinks about the way TCP IP and DNS and all that works until Facebook locks
[23:06.640 --> 23:10.480]  themselves out of their offices or something crazy. But yeah, RSS is very much like that. It's
[23:10.480 --> 23:16.480]  like a fundamental underlying thing that delivers podcasts, which are huge. And it does so because,
[23:16.480 --> 23:21.520]  I know you're aware of it just as a general broad thing, an RSS file is basically like a little bit
[23:21.520 --> 23:26.720]  of a header and just a list of entries about what each effectively episode is going to be.
[23:26.720 --> 23:31.360]  But they don't need to be episodes. They can be in case you block your link list or your articles.
[23:31.360 --> 23:34.560]  Do you put your full? Guess what I don't do? I don't use RSS anymore.
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.720]  You could read every word I write through the Daring Fireball RSS feed.
[23:38.720 --> 23:40.960]  At one point you didn't, right? It used to be like a blurb.
[23:40.960 --> 23:46.320]  Yeah, but that was a long time ago. And the long story short on that is that my idea was
[23:46.320 --> 23:52.400]  well, if I put the full content in, how do people see the ads? And I was experimenting with ads in
[23:52.400 --> 23:56.560]  the early days. And then I thought, well, wait, I could charge people for the full RSS feeds.
[23:56.560 --> 24:03.360]  And so I had a membership thing 2004, which is way before anybody had these memberships that
[24:03.360 --> 24:07.440]  are now very popular and very successful for people and subscription only newsletters and
[24:07.440 --> 24:13.440]  stuff. And the idea was for free, you could get the feed and it would have just the synopsis of
[24:13.440 --> 24:16.960]  an article and then you would just know it's something new. And then you double click it in
[24:16.960 --> 24:21.840]  your feed reader and go read it at my website. And that's when I started posting the link list
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.680]  posts, the short posts, like for the first two years during Fireball, they didn't exist.
[24:25.680 --> 24:32.560]  And I started posting those and I put them in the feed, but they were delayed by 24 hours.
[24:32.560 --> 24:37.280]  And so the idea was if you were a member, you'd get them right away. And if you were not a member,
[24:37.280 --> 24:42.320]  you got them 24 hours after they were posted. And that got annoying really quickly to me
[24:42.320 --> 24:46.560]  because there was sometimes I, a lot of stuff I post has no relevance to breaking news,
[24:46.560 --> 24:51.760]  but when it does, I want it to be out there. It was crazy that it was, here's my hot take.
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.400]  And the way that I might've written about it was as though it had just been announced.
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.960]  Apple just announced whatever. And I'm writing about it the next day, like it's breaking news,
[25:00.960 --> 25:05.280]  you know, to somebody who's subscribed to the free feed. But anyway, the long story short is that
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.280]  none of that membership stuff worked with Google Reader because Google Reader
[25:09.280 --> 25:17.920]  was... Because they wanted to index it once and serve it to all 25,000 or 50,000 subscribers.
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.720]  Whereas a membership feed has to, for 50, you know, let's say I had a thousand members at the
[25:22.720 --> 25:26.960]  time, would have to be indexed a thousand times and it didn't work. And I thought, well, what can
[25:26.960 --> 25:31.920]  I do to make these people happy? And I thought, well, what if I sold weekly sponsorships? Well,
[25:31.920 --> 25:35.600]  guess what? That's turned into my career. I think that's fascinating though, right? Like you,
[25:35.600 --> 25:38.960]  and don't take this the wrong way. Well, whatever. I don't really care if you do, because you're not
[25:38.960 --> 25:43.040]  going to be that mad at me. You stumbled backwards into it. Like I think you didn't stumble back,
[25:43.040 --> 25:49.040]  but you sat down, you considered the business model and you tried to implement it with linked
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.600]  lists that's a day late because I want to provide... Like you came at it from providing
[25:53.600 --> 25:59.920]  value in ways that you can monetize rather than just being like, okay, here's all of this stuff
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.480]  and I'll sell some ads on top. Like effective, are they native ads? I guess they're native ads.
[26:04.480 --> 26:08.160]  I guess they're native ads. They're in the same format, right? Yeah. I'm never quite clear on what
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.800]  the distinction is between a native ad and a... Because it's not like you run ads that are not
[26:12.800 --> 26:14.960]  pretty clearly delineated as being ads, right?
[26:14.960 --> 26:19.520]  Right. No, and that was the thing is that people who were trying to put ads in RSS feeds were
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.800]  putting like graphic ads at the bottom of each post and it sucked. Nobody wanted to see that.
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.960]  And so the idea that the actual post itself would be the sponsored content, but only once a week,
[26:30.960 --> 26:38.160]  so it wasn't annoying and it would give it a cache because it was like, it wasn't... As opposed to
[26:39.760 --> 26:47.120]  10 ads for one 10th the price, it's one ad for 10x the price. And then there's only 52 spots a year.
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.840]  And it's really hard to stuff Punch the Monkey in an RSS feed. And at the time,
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.720]  those were the kind of ads that were pretty prevalent in 2004.
[26:54.720 --> 26:58.240]  It's actually quite a while ago. It's quite a while ago at this time. It might've been like
[26:58.240 --> 27:02.880]  2014 or something like that, but I gave a talk at the XOXO conference in Portland.
[27:03.600 --> 27:07.040]  So if you want an hour long version of how I stumbled backwards into the
[27:08.080 --> 27:12.720]  revenue thing at Daring Fireball, you could watch that talk. I will put it in the show notes. I just
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.000]  made a note. But the weird... Here's the weird thing about RSS for an ongoing long running
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.600]  podcast is an RSS feed is just a single XML file. It starts and then it ends and that's it. And
[27:27.600 --> 27:36.160]  there's no mechanism built into the concept of RSS for paging, for lack of a better term. And paging
[27:36.160 --> 27:44.320]  to me has been damaging to the collective psyche of the world where you don't think about it now,
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.440]  but so much... All the social media we use like Twitter and Instagram and whatever else you wanna
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.680]  say, you never get to the bottom. There is no bottom. When you scroll to the bottom of the view,
[27:53.680 --> 27:58.480]  it just loads the next bunch of them. I remember sitting with you in... Not Shields,
[27:58.480 --> 28:04.800]  it was someplace in San Francisco, Irish Bank maybe? Probably. Playing with a build of Buzz's
[28:04.800 --> 28:11.360]  Twitter app. What was it called? There was... This is Buzz Anderson. And who did he work with? Was
[28:11.360 --> 28:16.000]  it Nevin? Yeah, it was Nevin. It was Buzz and Nevin who built... Nevin Murgen who's at
[28:16.000 --> 28:20.640]  Panic Now and Buzz Anderson. I don't know what he's up to now, but probably still being a rocker.
[28:20.640 --> 28:26.720]  Birdhouse. Birdhouse. No, no. Birdfeed. Birdfeed. Birdhouse was Adam's thing.
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.200]  That was Adam Lisagor's thing. When we tweeted so carefully that you might want to
[28:33.200 --> 28:38.960]  carefully construct your tweets over the course of a day or two, you'd use Birdhouse. I used to
[28:38.960 --> 28:42.560]  always get them confused even though they were both on my home screen in the early days of the
[28:42.560 --> 28:48.800]  phone. Birdhouse was just for crafting drafts of tweets because we tweeted so carefully.
[28:48.800 --> 28:53.040]  And Birdfeed was one of the first breakthrough third-party Twitter clients.
[28:53.040 --> 28:56.800]  I had the infinite scroll thing, which I was like, that is exactly... I remember sitting
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.760]  with you and being like, this is how it should work. This just makes the most sense.
[28:59.760 --> 29:06.080]  Because the other ones, including the official Twitter way of accessing Twitter on an iPhone,
[29:06.080 --> 29:12.480]  was to go to m dot... On the web, go to m.Twitter.com. And in some ways that was perfect
[29:12.480 --> 29:18.400]  because m.Twitter.com didn't even show user avatars. It just had names because we were
[29:18.400 --> 29:25.520]  on iPhones, which were on AT&T's Edge network, which had the bandwidth of tapping your finger
[29:25.520 --> 29:30.480]  on a stretched out piece of string. The cool thing about Twitter was that it
[29:30.480 --> 29:37.600]  predates the iPhone. It's coincident in that the original thing was just text messages.
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.160]  Yeah. It was meant that you could... The character limit originally came... The 140
[29:42.160 --> 29:49.680]  character limit came from the 160 character limit of SMS. And I forget if there was something magic
[29:49.680 --> 29:55.520]  about the 20 extra characters or if they just thought we should reserve 20 characters in case
[29:55.520 --> 30:00.720]  we need them being Twitter for our own... I forget if they actually did something with them or not,
[30:00.720 --> 30:06.240]  but SMS at the time was limited to 160 characters. It might still be. And the fact that you can send
[30:06.240 --> 30:10.480]  an SMS that is... I have a feeling it's... Yeah. It's a bunch of connection codes that string
[30:10.480 --> 30:16.320]  stuff together. Yeah. It strings like multiple ones together. But I think one actual SMS message
[30:16.320 --> 30:22.400]  by definition is limited to 160. And it's probably not characters. It's almost certainly bytes.
[30:22.400 --> 30:29.040]  Yeah. I forget exactly how it works, but it piggybacks on just cell data stuff. I can't
[30:29.040 --> 30:34.720]  remember. I don't want to be making it up to software. There's unused bits of cell data
[30:34.720 --> 30:38.720]  packages and they end up abusing those in a way to be able to get SMS messages.
[30:38.720 --> 30:43.520]  Yeah. But Twitter was built... And the idea was... Well, of course, most of the time you'll read this
[30:43.520 --> 30:48.480]  stuff on the web, on twitter.com, but you'll send your updates while you're out and about
[30:48.480 --> 30:51.840]  getting a sandwich or whatever from your T9 phone.
[30:51.840 --> 30:57.600]  Yeah. Which is a brilliant idea, right? That's smart. Legitimately smart. And I know Twitter
[30:57.600 --> 31:02.640]  descended into a hellhole, but mostly the whole world has. But that's still a really cool idea.
[31:02.640 --> 31:08.160]  And the fact that they are... Their longevity for a social media platform is pretty remarkable,
[31:08.160 --> 31:13.120]  I think. Yeah. But the thing I was getting at with RSS is we have a show that goes for hundreds
[31:13.120 --> 31:19.520]  and hundreds of episodes. The only way to make them all of the archive available to regular
[31:19.520 --> 31:26.400]  open podcast players is to include every episode you've ever done in the RSS feed. Now, the RSS
[31:26.400 --> 31:30.720]  feed, again, I don't want to get too technical here, but you don't include the actual audio
[31:30.720 --> 31:36.640]  file. The entry in the RSS feed is just text. And one of the entries is an enclosure element,
[31:36.640 --> 31:42.640]  and it points to a URL where the audio is. They don't download all the audio or not even close,
[31:42.640 --> 31:46.720]  but they do parse the whole feed. So they have a whole list of the episodes. And if you just...
[31:46.720 --> 31:51.600]  So if you... Let's say I fix my RSS feed and get every single episode that I've done with
[31:51.600 --> 31:55.520]  this version of the talk show back in there, and you want to go listen to the Rian Johnson
[31:55.520 --> 32:00.800]  episode, you could just scroll down to episode 87 or whatever it was, and it'll be grayed out
[32:00.800 --> 32:05.760]  in your podcast player, tap it and say download, and it'll download the audio for it on the fly
[32:05.760 --> 32:12.880]  without downloading the 300 episodes in between that one and this one. I'm looking at ATP. Now,
[32:12.880 --> 32:17.360]  ATP for a while, I was... Because I only do three episodes a month and they do one...
[32:17.360 --> 32:23.680]  They do 52 a year every year like clockwork. They long since passed me. I think this episode
[32:23.680 --> 32:30.800]  you and I are doing is 335 of the talk show. They're up to 466 on ATP. And I just looked at
[32:30.800 --> 32:40.640]  their feed and lo and behold, there are 466 item elements in their RSS feed. So even for a weekly
[32:40.640 --> 32:46.240]  show, it's tenable and with zip compression, it's not that big of a download. But I would imagine
[32:46.240 --> 32:50.720]  that... I don't even know. I actually... I'm sure Marco would know. I could probably have him on
[32:50.720 --> 32:56.080]  and talk. But let's say somebody does a daily podcast. At some point, it becomes untenable
[32:56.080 --> 33:01.680]  to have an RSS feed that contains every single... After 10 years, it doesn't... There's a scaling
[33:01.680 --> 33:07.600]  point where it's like, hey, I don't know, 4,000 items in the RSS feed, it's getting out of control.
[33:07.600 --> 33:11.520]  But then how else does a podcast player listen to the old episodes? Anyway, let me take a break
[33:11.520 --> 33:17.680]  here and thank our first sponsor, brand new sponsor. Oh boy. Hey, 90% of coffee that you
[33:17.680 --> 33:22.880]  could buy at your local grocery store, it's actually stale. You've heard that right. The
[33:22.880 --> 33:27.920]  coffee you know and think you love needs an upgrade. Instead of rebuying the same old,
[33:27.920 --> 33:35.200]  same old, let Trade Coffee send you something freshly roasted that you are literally
[33:35.200 --> 33:42.000]  guaranteed to love. Trade Coffee sells the freshest roasted and ethically sourced beans

[34:22.880 --> 34:26.800]  I will verify this. I don't know if I'm a coffee nerd or not, but I am a bit fussy about it and I
[34:26.800 --> 34:32.560]  can absolutely verify that it is the truth that roasted coffee is not like something that stays
[34:32.560 --> 34:36.960]  good on the shelf forever. It's not like a bag of potato chips or something like that. It gets
[34:36.960 --> 34:44.000]  old quick. You want fresh, freshly roasted coffee and doing it with a subscription service is,
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.440]  in my opinion, the way to go. Trade Coffee is excellent. It really is. So here's the deal.

[35:25.280 --> 35:29.600]  I've got a cup of coffee right here. I wanted to have you on. One of the other reasons I thought
[35:29.600 --> 35:35.280]  to have you on was the video game stuff. Microsoft has announced their intention to buy Activision
[35:35.280 --> 35:43.760]  Blizzard for $69 billion. I can't help but think it's $68.7 billion. And I know it is totally
[35:43.760 --> 35:53.040]  juvenile to laugh about $69, but it really seems to me like if it was $67.8 billion instead of $68.7,
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.400]  everybody would be calling it $68 billion deal. But it seems like most of the major news sites
[35:58.400 --> 36:05.600]  talking about it are going with $68.7. I say official, the editor's desk, Daring Fireball slash
[36:05.600 --> 36:11.760]  the talk show. It's $69 billion. Yeah, I'm with you. $69 billion for Activision and Blizzard.
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.840]  You guys had a great discussion about this on Dithering, by the way. Oh, well, thank you very
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.040]  much. Yeah, I'm amazed you pulled that off. That is a good show. A tight 15 minutes is...
[36:21.040 --> 36:25.840]  I don't know if you've noticed, dude, we're 48 minutes into this. Yeah, I know. Three ditherings.
[36:25.840 --> 36:33.760]  We've done one ad read, and I swear to God, listeners at home, this is the top thing that's
[36:33.760 --> 36:38.240]  on our list of things to talk about. But yeah, good job on Dithering. Whatever. That's my advert.
[36:38.240 --> 36:41.680]  Go listen to that if you can. I guess maybe summarize that. Summarize what you and Ben
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.160]  talked about. I don't remember. I have podcast amnesia, but I remember what I wrote about it
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.320]  more than what we talked about, because I really do forget what I talk about on podcasts. But
[36:50.320 --> 36:56.560]  basically, to me, it solidifies the preeminent, honestly, preeminent place, at least financially,
[36:56.560 --> 37:02.560]  but probably in time too, which is why it's so preeminent financially in pop culture,
[37:02.560 --> 37:10.640]  where video games are, right? And older people tend to, and probably among even people like in
[37:10.640 --> 37:16.560]  our generation, Gen Xers who are listening to the show, this show, we grew up in the video game era.
[37:16.560 --> 37:23.760]  So even though we're now the middle-aged adults in the prime of our lives, supposedly,
[37:23.760 --> 37:28.560]  lots of us play video games and spend lots of money on video games. It's not like when
[37:28.560 --> 37:35.440]  we were kids and older people really dismissed video games as junk, right? Like the way in,
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.920]  comic books are the same way, right? Nobody took comic books seriously, or almost nobody serious
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.880]  took comic books seriously. And now our generation grew up with that, and we take comic books super
[37:44.880 --> 37:50.080]  seriously. Like we treat it as a full-fledged form of literature and art. Games, comic book,
[37:50.640 --> 37:56.800]  Star Wars, that kind of thing, they evolve. And it's, I think once you can go to the bank with
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.520]  a big sack of money, people start paying attention, which is ugly, but true. Yeah, there was,
[38:02.480 --> 38:10.080]  not sad, it's sad that Roger Ebert died too young, but one of the last things I remember
[38:10.080 --> 38:19.600]  about Roger Ebert before he died was that he was in a long-running public debate over the question
[38:19.600 --> 38:28.320]  of, are video games art, or can they be art? And he was on the side of no, which to me is clearly
[38:28.320 --> 38:35.440]  wrong. And Roger Ebert is another one of those people who I have definitely had over a 90%
[38:35.440 --> 38:41.520]  agreement rate with him on movies. Maybe not quite 95%, but at least nine out of ten times
[38:41.520 --> 38:48.080]  his thumbs up or thumbs down for a movie I saw, I agreed with. But man, and I'm not that I'm not
[38:48.080 --> 38:53.040]  a big video game person anymore. I was when I was younger, I'm obsessed with them, and it's somehow,
[38:54.080 --> 39:00.320]  it's just something that I've let slip by for lack of time or anything. It takes a lot of time.
[39:00.320 --> 39:05.520]  There's just an investment in time that gets fleeting as you grow up. But even as somebody who
[39:05.520 --> 39:11.120]  as an adult does not really spend much time at all playing video games or staying up to date on the
[39:11.120 --> 39:17.200]  industry, man, I just knew he was wrong. And it was always wrong. Pac-Man was art. You cannot,
[39:17.200 --> 39:22.400]  it doesn't have to be Breath of the Wild or something like that to say, well, this video
[39:22.400 --> 39:28.240]  game is art. I'm saying video games have been art from the beginning. Asteroids was art. It was like
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.640]  that. Yeah, I agree. And I know we share the sensibility because not to give anything away,
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.360]  but we're always talking about dumb old projects and stuff that we enjoy. And this comes up all
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.080]  the time. So I'm well aware that one of the guys that I actually, I met through Rogue Amoeba and I
[39:42.080 --> 39:46.800]  worked with on Death Revenge, which is a rhythm game for early iPhone. This guy, Mark Johns,
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.320]  was one of the correspondents with Ebert going back and forth about whether video games are art
[39:52.320 --> 39:57.040]  or not. And he shared a couple of private emails with me. I agree with you. I think Ebert got it
[39:57.040 --> 40:03.600]  wrong. And that's okay. I kind of like that he got it wrong. There's a value to the consistency
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.880]  of his viewpoint. And you don't need, you don't need everybody from, I don't want to say previous
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.960]  generation, but like everybody that is more accustomed to one way of doing things to buy
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.520]  into the new way of doing things. It doesn't diminish their opinion on their preferred form
[40:19.520 --> 40:26.000]  of art. Scorsese, another guy who I'm positive we both just think the world of, complained about
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.160]  superhero movies. And good for him because guess what? They're not casino that we were just talking
[40:30.160 --> 40:33.680]  about. They're not good fellas. Like they are a different thing. They were fundamentally a
[40:33.680 --> 40:41.200]  different thing. Now, does that make them any less of an art form or any less of a film or
[40:41.200 --> 40:44.400]  any more than is Pac-Man less of a game than something that has a strong narrative?
[40:44.400 --> 40:52.560]  Yeah, Scorsese, and you know what? He dismisses wrong. I feel Ebert was dismissive of video games
[40:52.560 --> 40:57.840]  and Scorsese wasn't dismissive of them so much, but said that they weren't cinema. They were
[40:57.840 --> 41:03.600]  theme park attractions. Yeah, something like that. I forget, but yeah. And just to be clear,
[41:03.600 --> 41:10.960]  I am perfectly sympathetic to his point of view. Not for me. I talk to molten Dan Martin every week
[41:10.960 --> 41:16.080]  about silly superhero stuff. I enjoyed it a lot. And I'm perfectly fine with him having the
[41:16.080 --> 41:21.600]  opinion that, look, this is not high cinema. Sure. I don't even disagree with him. I just
[41:21.600 --> 41:27.600]  don't think that the point of everything needs to be what you find valuable in a form of art.
[41:27.600 --> 41:33.760]  Yeah. Although I would say things have less artistic value than others. And I, for example,
[41:34.320 --> 41:41.120]  am not a fan of the Justice League and you don't have to argue about the Joss Whedon version
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.960]  or the Snyder cut. I sat through the whole Snyder cut, but it took me, I watched it like it was an
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.400]  HBO series, but it was like, it was like a 10 parter for me. I was like, Oh my God, I'm going
[41:52.400 --> 41:58.240]  to sleep again. Time for bed. 20 more minutes. Clearly though, an enormous amount of artistic
[41:58.240 --> 42:05.840]  effort went into it. It just wasn't to my liking. I'm also not nearly as big a fan in the Marvel
[42:05.840 --> 42:12.080]  side. The ones with the Avengers, I'm less a fan of. To me, it is theme park attraction-y.
[42:12.080 --> 42:18.240]  It's bombastic. And holy crap, do I love the Iron Man movies. Oh my God. It's like,
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.520]  you cannot tell me that those are not really good movies. Iron Man one is a swear to God,
[42:23.520 --> 42:28.080]  good movie. That is just a good film. I feel like, I don't know, maybe you watched it or not,
[42:28.080 --> 42:33.120]  but I do feel like you could have a conversation with Ebert about it when it came out about,
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.240]  Hey, this is an actual, how do you feel about this? Sure. He flies around and the end final
[42:38.240 --> 42:44.720]  act is I'm going to fight a bigger version of me and win, but it's a legit good movie. And
[42:45.760 --> 42:53.440]  also Robert Downer Jr. getting to play, what was his name? Roger from Mad Men. Roger from Mad Men
[42:53.440 --> 43:00.560]  reads like a, well, actually that's his dad. John Slattery is Roger from Mad Men plays old man
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.880]  Stark. I forget his name. How perfect is that? Yeah. That really makes sense. It's yeah.
[43:04.880 --> 43:10.000]  Roger from Mad Men gets a suit of armor, basically. It's an interesting tangent because
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.760]  you and I are the perfect generation to know that superhero movies were deemed unfilmable
[43:18.800 --> 43:25.280]  until Richard Donner's Superman, which was the only exception. It was the only hit superhero
[43:25.280 --> 43:29.840]  movie of our entire childhood. That is a legitimately good film. That is a film from
[43:29.840 --> 43:36.080]  78, I believe. 78, I believe, or 79. Like the year after Star Wars, like very contemporary of that
[43:36.800 --> 43:43.440]  legitimately great 1970s film. Like the seventies were amazing for film and you get, oh, whatever,
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.200]  Mean Streets and a bunch of crazy stuff. You get Star Wars, you get Jaws and you get the Superman
[43:49.200 --> 43:56.240]  movie, which was incredible. Like mind-bloringly incredible. It still is. He doesn't fight anybody.
[43:56.240 --> 44:00.240]  He just saves lives, which is awesome. Still goosebumps with from the theme song.
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.080]  I know, you know, John Williams, of course, is celebrated composer of our lifetimes,
[44:06.080 --> 44:10.960]  especially for blockbuster type movies and Star Wars and Indiana Jones and ET and literally name
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.480]  any Spielberg movie. And he's done the theme, but man, Superman might be the best, at least the most
[44:16.480 --> 44:20.720]  perfect. It's just unbelievable. But other than Superman, it was like the exception that proved
[44:20.720 --> 44:26.800]  the rule and that the studio really screwed Richard Donner over. And I don't want to go on a huge side
[44:26.800 --> 44:33.440]  tangent, but the reason that the sequels went downhill very quickly was that the producers
[44:33.440 --> 44:38.800]  did not agree with Richard Donner. And most of Superman II was actually shot by Richard Donner
[44:38.800 --> 44:45.600]  as part of Superman I, but the parts that weren't were not, they don't really gel together. Superman
[44:45.600 --> 44:52.720]  III started to get silly. I believe that's where Richard Pryor came in. And it's hard to go wrong
[44:52.720 --> 45:00.480]  with Richard Pryor, but they did. I don't know how you make a bad movie or an unfunny movie with
[45:00.480 --> 45:05.760]  Richard Pryor, but they managed it. But Superman I disproved it. But the big problem was special
[45:05.760 --> 45:12.960]  effects, right? And it's like, so Star Wars was obviously super special effects driven,
[45:12.960 --> 45:19.760]  but it was almost like Star Wars, not even almost, I think it's by definition,
[45:20.640 --> 45:25.200]  it's like they figured out things they could do. There's the computer-driven
[45:25.200 --> 45:30.960]  spaceship stuff that Kubrick pioneered with Douglas Trumbull for 2001 that made
[45:31.520 --> 45:37.600]  spaceships look real. And they used the same techniques and Douglas Trumbull and the same
[45:37.600 --> 45:45.360]  people even to make like Star Destroyers look real in 1977. But then the other things, there just
[45:45.360 --> 45:52.480]  wasn't a lot in the Jedis that you saw, you only saw it too, right? Darth Vader and Obi-Wan as an
[45:52.480 --> 45:58.080]  old man. And neither of them really did anything special effects driven, right? The Jedi mind trick
[45:58.080 --> 46:03.440]  didn't involve effects. It just, you just... No, it was the land speed that was like Vaseline
[46:03.440 --> 46:07.760]  on the land. A bunch of rotoscoping for the blades, I believe, are like shining lights
[46:07.760 --> 46:12.400]  on these weird rotating rods. So just, I want to get back to man weird. But I'm just saying
[46:12.400 --> 46:18.240]  that they limited, Star Wars limited what was technically impossible, what was fantastic to
[46:18.240 --> 46:25.120]  what they could film reasonably. Whereas if you want to make a Spider-Man movie in 1977,
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.360]  everybody already knows what Spider-Man is supposed to be able to do. And if you can't
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.720]  shoot that with the special effects of the time, it's not going to work. It's like the Batman 66
[46:34.720 --> 46:38.640]  when he's walking up the wall and they've tilted the camera sideways. Right. You had to go campy
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.920]  as opposed to making it serious. Right. Oh wait, just a man is killing me because I know Todd's
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.840]  listening. The Trumbull stuff was, you said computer-controlled graphics were all like this.
[46:47.840 --> 46:54.560]  The notion is that you've got a camera on a stepper motor and you've got your model on a
[46:54.560 --> 46:58.960]  motor and the computers would step and move the camera and take a photo and then step and move the
[46:58.960 --> 47:04.400]  camera for the model and the camera movements. And that would give you a TIE fighter flying by or
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.520]  like the Millennium Falcon or the Star Destroyer sort of moving. Right. So the computer control
[47:09.520 --> 47:14.720]  was not, it wasn't computer-generated in a way, but it was used to drive motors that moved big,
[47:14.720 --> 47:20.480]  physical, heavy things. In a way that doing it. It was reproducible. Right. And it was reproducible
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.200]  and you couldn't do it by hand. It was too painstaking. And the reason it needed to be
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.080]  reproducible was that the lights on the Star Destroyer were done in a separate past than the
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.080]  actual paint job on the Star Destroyer. Like they would, I don't know if they turn the lights off,
[47:34.080 --> 47:38.960]  but they would film the Star Destroyer doing one move or camera pan over Star Destroyer.
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.560]  Then they would turn all the lights off and just light up the little lights, little in the model,
[47:44.560 --> 47:48.640]  and then film that and then composite them one on top of each other so that it would look like
[47:48.640 --> 47:52.880]  the lights were giving a glow, which is why it needed to be so reproducible all the time,
[47:52.880 --> 47:57.360]  because otherwise you couldn't stick in those special effects. Anyway, there you go.
[47:57.360 --> 47:59.520]  Can I tell you, I'll just tell you that. I hope I got that right.
[48:00.080 --> 48:03.600]  I've mentioned this. I know that I don't want to, again, I don't want to go off on a tangent, but
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.400]  I know that I've, I know that I've mentioned this on our Star Wars spectaculars before,
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.600]  but I have a very vivid memory of going to see Star Wars in the theater the first time
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.360]  with my dad. And it was just me and my dad must've been 1977. And, but it was already in our
[48:21.360 --> 48:27.840]  neighborhood movie theater. So Star Wars had been out for a while. It wasn't like May of 1977, but
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.240]  we went to see it because of what they do with movies. Then it was, there'd be like first run
[48:32.240 --> 48:37.440]  movie theaters and then like second run, which would come out like months later. And I wanted
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.880]  to go, that's all I could think about. And my dad took me to see it. And my dad was, wasn't like
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.280]  begrudging, but I could tell he didn't think he was going to like it that he thought it was going
[48:47.280 --> 48:52.800]  to be like the Flash Gordon shit that he saw when he was younger. Understandably so. Why would he
[48:52.800 --> 48:58.560]  not think that? All he knew, it was a kid's movie about Ray guns and, and spaceships. And we go to
[48:58.560 --> 49:03.920]  the movie theater and we get our popcorn and we get our seats. And a very vivid memory of being,
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.560]  even though I was very young is the opening shot, which I believe I would hold up as
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.720]  perhaps the greatest opening shot in any movie ever made is the blockade runner going and the
[49:14.720 --> 49:18.560]  lasers and then all of a sudden this spaceship. You already think it's big. You're like, wow,
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.440]  that's cool. And then, oh, you have no idea what's coming. Right. Which was wonderfully parodied by
[49:23.440 --> 49:30.000]  Mel Brooks's Spaceballs. Yeah. Right. But it's just unbelievable because it looks so real and
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.760]  it's so big and conveys this and conveys, you don't, they don't have to tell you which ship
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.560]  is the good guy and which is the bad guy just by the shape of the ships and the size of the ships.
[49:40.560 --> 49:44.800]  It's cinematic. One thing that I think is underappreciated is that like the laser
[49:44.800 --> 49:49.680]  blasts just miss like there. Yep. Yep. Yep. Cause it gives you the sense of scale of like,
[49:49.680 --> 49:54.560]  well, they're trying to hit it, but it's like, everything's so big that it's not like a direct
[49:54.560 --> 50:00.720]  beam and you're going to cut it open. It's just this big mass of metal moving through space with
[50:00.720 --> 50:05.360]  just chaos going around. It feels like a world war II movie where flat cannons are just going off as
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.480]  the bombs are coming in. I remember my dad and he was on my left. This is how vividly I remember it.
[50:10.480 --> 50:16.080]  He's on my left. And he put his hand on my, like my knee, gave it a squeeze and looked at me and
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.960]  said, Hey, that's awesome. This is the real deal. And then my dad loved it. He absolutely loved it,
[50:20.960 --> 50:25.440]  took it to see me again. But it was that opening shot. It was the various, the reality of it. It
[50:25.440 --> 50:29.920]  was like, okay, this is no kidding around. But I know it's a very long tangent there, but it's the
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.760]  way media, new media comes in. Like when movies were new, they were dismissed as nonsense and
[50:35.760 --> 50:40.640]  anybody serious would read novels. But like when novels were new, you can find people on Twitter,
[50:40.640 --> 50:46.800]  like when novels became like a personal, something that literacy was widespread enough and book
[50:46.800 --> 50:54.320]  printing was cheap enough that, that people could buy their own novels or like all of Dickens' stuff
[50:54.320 --> 51:02.080]  came out serially. It was chapter by chapter and you'd buy it. But it was high and snooty.
[51:02.080 --> 51:06.880]  People would be like, well, this is, this is just rotting the brains of the proletariat. It's,
[51:06.880 --> 51:10.960]  and every new thing that comes out and then TV comes out and the movie industry dismisses it.
[51:10.960 --> 51:15.040]  Nobody wants to watch stuff on a tiny little glass tube in their house when they could go
[51:15.040 --> 51:19.360]  to the movie theater and see a giant technicolor picture or whatever. And that's exactly the
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.800]  dismissiveness of video games, right? That a film critic of, I would say the preeminent film critic
[51:24.800 --> 51:30.240]  of the 20th century, Roger Ebert, are certainly up there on the short list. And without question,
[51:30.240 --> 51:35.920]  the most popular because he actually brought movie criticism to TV with Gene Siskel, it was
[51:35.920 --> 51:44.800]  person who is too focused on the previous medium being instinctively dismissive of the new medium.
[51:44.800 --> 51:50.960]  But inevitably the new medium grows dwarf the old one. And that's the thing about the $69 billion
[51:50.960 --> 51:55.440]  price tag for it. Just one, one. That was a long road, man, but man, you brought it back.
[51:56.080 --> 52:02.240]  And the comparison is, I mentioned this, is that when Disney bought Lucasfilm 10 years
[52:02.240 --> 52:10.720]  ago or 11 years ago, it was for $4 billion or $5 billion. And it has been brought to my attention
[52:10.720 --> 52:16.400]  that George Lucas did not exactly shop it around. He had, when he decided, you know what,
[52:16.960 --> 52:24.560]  I'm 68 or 69, however old he was at the time and thought, I, you know, there needs to be another
[52:24.560 --> 52:30.480]  trilogy. I don't have it in me. He had a, at the time, still, I'm sure she must not be that old,
[52:30.480 --> 52:36.800]  but he had a young daughter, knew firsthand how long a trilogy would take him to do. He's like,
[52:36.800 --> 52:40.960]  you know what? I should walk away from this now and sell it. He more or less had it in mind to
[52:40.960 --> 52:48.240]  sell to Disney as the long-term steward of this franchise. That would clearly, 10, 11 years ago,
[52:48.240 --> 52:55.280]  it was obvious Star Wars is going to be relevant pop culture-wise long past George Lucas being
[52:55.280 --> 53:00.320]  alive. Even if George Lucas lives to be 102, it's still going to be a thing.
[53:00.320 --> 53:02.640]  Steve McLaughlin Star Wars is a cultural phenomenon at this point.
[53:02.640 --> 53:06.960]  Chris Swenor Quite possibly could have gotten a higher price tag than what Disney paid. He was
[53:06.960 --> 53:12.800]  going to sell to Disney. They were like, how about 4 billion? But even if he had said, I will sell
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.800]  this to the highest bidder, I don't think he was going to get, it's not like he shortchanged
[53:16.800 --> 53:17.360]  himself.
[53:17.360 --> 53:23.840]  Steve McLaughlin No. Well, first of all, I, you will never catch me saying 4 billion for anything
[53:23.840 --> 53:28.160]  that's being shortchanged. I guess I should if I'm being like financial analyst dude or business
[53:28.160 --> 53:35.280]  but yeah, no, 4 billion. Great, great thing. Also, I think he legitimately respected the work
[53:36.320 --> 53:37.360]  that Disney Company did.
[53:37.360 --> 53:42.000]  Chris Swenor Oh, well, and especially, I know when, I actually went searching for it and
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.960]  couldn't find good articles. But when it happened, I remember him saying that one of the things he
[53:46.960 --> 53:55.840]  really respected was how much Disney, even in 2013, or 2011, 2012, how much respect the Disney
[53:55.840 --> 54:05.600]  Company still had for stuff that Disney had made in 1930, 1940, 1950, and that that's why he felt
[54:05.600 --> 54:09.040]  like this, this is the best hands, my work, this creation could be in.
[54:09.040 --> 54:11.680]  Steve McLaughlin There was some negative stuff like that with the internal copyright
[54:11.680 --> 54:18.400]  extensions and all kinds of weird stuff. So that's not always great. But along those lines,
[54:18.400 --> 54:26.160]  and this sort of tangently connected, would Steve Jobs have sold next to Sun?
[54:26.160 --> 54:29.840]  Chris Swenor Right, no, probably not. Well, I don't know. I do think though that there was
[54:29.840 --> 54:33.280]  Steve McLaughlin I think he was very happy to Jedi Mind, just to bring it all together.
[54:33.280 --> 54:33.520]  Chris Swenor Yeah.
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.640]  Steve McLaughlin I was happy to, I think he was pretty, probably pretty happy to Jedi
[54:36.640 --> 54:41.520]  Mind trick the Apple board into having them buy him back rather than going, working for
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.440]  Scott McNeely. Was it Scott McNeely? I almost said Scott McNulty.
[54:45.440 --> 54:45.600]  Chris Swenor No.
[54:45.600 --> 54:47.760]  Steve McLaughlin Steve Jobs working for Scott McNulty would be awesome.
[54:47.760 --> 54:50.720]  Chris Swenor God, I hope Scott McNulty listens.
[54:50.720 --> 54:52.000]  Steve McLaughlin I hope so, yeah.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  Chris Swenor No, Scott McNeely, you're right. No, I thought you were going to go with Pixar,
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.840]  where he sold to Disney. But I do think that the difference between Lucas selling Lucasfilm to
[55:01.840 --> 55:07.920]  Disney and Jobs selling Pixar to Disney was that Jobs extracted every dollar he could. Even if
[55:07.920 --> 55:14.800]  there wasn't really a great Plan B, I think Plan B would have been to keep Pixar independent, right?
[55:14.800 --> 55:18.000]  And the gun that was to Pixar's head. Chris Swenor I don't think it was going to go
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.600]  to Geffen or whatever those guys were. Steve McLaughlin
[55:19.600 --> 55:21.520]  No, DreamWorks or whatever. Chris Swenor DreamWorks, yeah.
[55:21.520 --> 55:26.880]  Steve McLaughlin But the gun that was to Pixar's head, the leverage Disney had over them was that
[55:26.880 --> 55:35.680]  Disney owned the IP for the pictures they'd already made. So if Pixar hadn't either maintained
[55:37.280 --> 55:41.520]  two different companies, but like a permanent relationship going forward or,
[55:41.520 --> 55:46.640]  all right, we'll just sell ourselves and become a subsidiary of Disney. Disney would have been the
[55:46.640 --> 55:51.680]  one who had the rights to Toy Story and to Monsters, Inc. and whatever else. And Pixar
[55:51.680 --> 55:57.600]  would have had to go with all of their own IP afterwards, you know. So there was, it wasn't
[55:57.600 --> 55:58.720]  completely... Steve McLaughlin
[55:58.720 --> 56:01.680]  You think they had him a little over a barrel? Chris Swenor
[56:01.680 --> 56:03.360]  But I don't even know if he would be fighting it.
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.760]  Steve McLaughlin But it wasn't the easy sell that Lucasfilm
[56:07.760 --> 56:15.120]  to Disney was. And I also think you don't have to, as a distant outsider like we are, you could
[56:15.120 --> 56:19.760]  easily see the personality difference between George Lucas and Steve Jobs in that way, right?
[56:19.760 --> 56:20.800]  Chris Swenor Yeah, a little bit.
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  That must be a fascinating room to be in. Steve McLaughlin
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.040]  And I don't think Jobs ever gave two craps about his own personal
[56:29.040 --> 56:32.400]  wealth other than just being comfortable. But he was...
[56:32.400 --> 56:33.040]  Chris Swenor He was going to be fine.
[56:33.040 --> 56:35.120]  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, he was never in a race to be
[56:35.120 --> 56:39.120]  richer than Bill Gates or if he were still around, Jeff Bezos.
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.360]  Chris Swenor I do think he may have
[56:42.560 --> 56:46.240]  actually redefined success to be whatever he was doing rather than whatever they were doing.
[56:47.280 --> 56:49.600]  I don't think he cared. He was like, I'm rich. What do I care?
[56:49.600 --> 56:50.800]  Steve McLaughlin And like one of the last...
[56:50.800 --> 56:52.560]  Chris Swenor I don't need to go to space. I'm fine.
[56:52.560 --> 56:54.960]  Steve McLaughlin One of the last things he built or created
[56:54.960 --> 57:02.000]  before he passed was a $500 million mega yacht. It wasn't like he was hurting for money. But he
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.720]  wasn't in a race to accumulate wealth. But I just feel that there was an edge to Steve Jobs where
[57:06.720 --> 57:11.520]  he did not want to get... he did not want... if Disney was going to buy Pixar and it was inevitable,
[57:11.520 --> 57:18.160]  they were going to get every goddamn 50 cents worth of value for it that they deserved, right?
[57:18.160 --> 57:22.880]  Chris Swenor So getting back to the actual topic at hand,
[57:22.880 --> 57:33.200]  this Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing, clearly the 69 billion dollar value is a testament to
[57:34.800 --> 57:41.040]  I guess the cultural share that video games have in our world today, at least the Western world.
[57:41.040 --> 57:45.600]  It is the biggest purchase Microsoft ever made, which is weird, right? If you thought
[57:45.600 --> 57:53.440]  that Microsoft's big money splash would be on video games back in the 90s or even 2000s,
[57:53.440 --> 57:54.960]  I don't think I would have believed it. Steve McLaughlin
[57:54.960 --> 58:02.480]  Even after they started like with Xbox, right? Where they were... it's let's say pre-Xbox gaming
[58:02.480 --> 58:08.880]  or you wouldn't... we never... in the 90s even, we never spoke of gaming PCs because I think...
[58:08.880 --> 58:14.800]  and again, I don't want to go too far in technical weeds, but everything was so CPU driven
[58:15.600 --> 58:22.480]  that there was better PCs and slower PCs and if anything that a PC that was faster would be
[58:22.480 --> 58:29.280]  better for games and a PC that was slower would be worse for games. And PCs were always had a more
[58:29.280 --> 58:38.480]  vibrant game market than the Mac, even 80s, 90s, but it wasn't a huge thing and it certainly
[58:38.480 --> 58:44.160]  seemed incidental to Microsoft's interest. Microsoft was making money just selling the
[58:44.160 --> 58:50.400]  operating systems and themselves selling Office and stuff like, you know, Office, let's just say
[58:50.400 --> 58:57.200]  Office, whereas the Xbox, the original Xbox in 1999 or 2000 or whatever seemed to be the first
[58:57.200 --> 59:01.360]  time where they were like, okay, let's see what we can do if we actually focus on games.
[59:01.360 --> 59:04.080]  Steve McLaughlin So the thing about Microsoft...
[59:04.080 --> 59:08.160]  Steve McLaughlin But you would never think even then, even with... but not to interrupt you,
[59:08.160 --> 59:13.920]  I'm sorry, but I agree with you, though, that even then with Xbox where they were like... and
[59:13.920 --> 59:18.320]  the Xbox wasn't like a quiet little thing. It was a huge focus. They... I think they introduced it
[59:18.320 --> 59:24.160]  like CES and it was... they promoted it as heavily as they could, but you would have never thought at
[59:24.160 --> 59:29.200]  the time that their biggest, biggest acquisition would be a video game studio. It would have been
[59:29.200 --> 59:35.520]  bananas, even after they came out with Xbox. Steve McLaughlin I agree. So back then,
[59:35.520 --> 59:41.680]  Microsoft was just... I think the antitrust thing just settled. It was around that era where they
[59:41.680 --> 59:46.560]  had been castigated. Think about it, castigated? Man, I don't know why I'm asking you to pronounce
[59:46.560 --> 59:49.440]  something. That's the dumbest... Steve McLaughlin I know that one, castigated.
[59:49.440 --> 59:52.640]  Steve McLaughlin Castigated, thank you. Yeah, they've been castigated by the courts. I didn't
[59:52.640 --> 01:00:00.080]  like Microsoft growing up. I mean, they got the DOS deal in a weird, not shady, but somebody that
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.520]  happened to be out of the office and they got the contract for DOS. They did a lot of really shady
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:14.160]  stuff back then that involved charging people like Dell or Gateway per Intel CPU sold, like per PC
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.560]  sold, even if Windows didn't run on it because somebody was going to pirate Windows and stick it
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:27.520]  on their PC. And which really precluded stuff like BOS taking off or expanding the market for
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.880]  alternative operating systems. They've only suffered from that. Go ahead.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.880]  Yeah, that was your baby. Well, it wasn't just... they might've said that it was a piracy type
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.920]  thing, but you know, I think that they did... Steve McLaughlin No, it's rent-seeking. It's
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.880]  rent-seeking on a PC platform. That was it. I think their public excuse for the contracts,
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.200]  which was basically if you wanted to license... let's say you're Dell and you want to sell some
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:58.080]  Dell computers pre-installed with Windows, which obviously Dell wanted to do because an awful lot
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.120]  of people wanted to buy a Dell computer, take it out of the box, turn it on and boot into Windows.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.680]  Steve McLaughlin Yeah, most people, except me at the time, but sure. Yes, definitely.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.880]  Steve McLaughlin But Microsoft's licensing terms were if you want to sell any computers with
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.720]  Windows pre-installed and pre-licensed, you have to buy a Windows license for every single PC you
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.360]  sell. And they said it was like a piracy thing because they're like... because if you sell them
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:28.800]  blank, literally like a PC with no operating system installed, which sounds ridiculous now.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.520]  Steve McLaughlin Linux wasn't as much of a thing then. It's like... it's not even now. It is,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:39.600]  obviously, but then they said it was a constant joke. Guess what? Late 90s, very much a joke.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.760]  That was not an avenue for success. But in the other big difference that's really hard,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.720]  if you didn't live through it, it's hard to remember how viable it was, was that there...
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.960]  it really was an era where every couple years there might be a new operating system that would
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.320]  take over. And things like in the 90s... Steve McLaughlin Back in the 80s, like mid-80s,
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.240]  90s, definitely. We had... remember Amiga? That was awesome. I'm not saying that should go on
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.320]  and everything, but... That was a great OS. A lot of great things from Mac OS and...
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.280]  They could do things that other computers couldn't do, like the video toaster for Amiga
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.120]  was editing digital video at a time when other computers, including the Mac, admittedly couldn't
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.960]  even play video at all. Literally. QuickTime didn't even exist. It was a time rich with...
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.840]  I don't even like the word innovation, but with new applications, and I don't mean applications
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:38.560]  in the way we do a.app, but just like, how can we take what we now know about making chips
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:42.800]  and making software and come up with weird and crazy ideas? And some of them were fascinating,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.680]  like Mac OS, the classic Mac OS, was predicated upon having a single user, like a single user,
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:53.440]  a single address space, and we're just going to do this awesome thing. And that made a lot of sense
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.960]  until it didn't, right? Like we discovered, evolutionary, that that didn't work out.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:03.520]  Windows cloned it. To say the least. Well... No, but it was true. It came out okay.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.280]  Obviously, it came out okay. They're like a, what, $3 trillion business at this point. But,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.120]  you know, Windows was saying, oh, that's not a bad idea. Let's copy it. By the time they got NT,
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:18.640]  they got some like serious OS people in there that were like Unix equivalent OS makers. And
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.680]  ultimately, like, things managed to converge to where we are now. But there was a time
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.400]  where everything felt like a fertile field of just, hey, who knows what the hell is going on?
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.000]  Like, B didn't even believe in window title bars that extended the length of the window,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:42.320]  which looked really fucking cool. I love that look. And the more I think about it, I'm like,
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:49.440]  that is just a, that's a nightmare. Like, why would I want my, if my notes to John
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:54.320]  were just the middle finger emoji, I could not drag that into a round. It's tiny.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.520]  I think they, I think they might've had a minimum width if it was a really
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.320]  short length. It was small. People were trying new and interesting stuff all the time. And that's,
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.920]  I think that's a great place to be in. And as you're enjoying that vibe and things start
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.800]  to get constrained, I think generally you, you feel that the world, not the world, but
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.080]  the technology world you're invested in is closing in around you. And I think that
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:25.200]  is echoed by classic Mac OS people making the transition to AppKit and Cocoa and stuff. And I
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:31.200]  think that Mac people as we transition to more of an iOS model are similarly dealing with that.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.080]  This has nothing to do with Activision and Microsoft, but.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:43.280]  Well, but it speaks, I do think though, it's an interesting tangent and very talk showy
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:51.840]  to just say it, even in the year 2000, after the DOJ problems, after the X-Box was announced,
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:57.280]  to say, if you would have told somebody then in the year 2022, Microsoft is still
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.680]  one of the two biggest companies in the world. You'd say, yeah,
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:06.400]  I believe that because you'd think the future is bright for a company that they weren't like,
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:11.040]  and you might say, I think at the time, I literally think at the time, if it wasn't Microsoft,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.520]  Exxon might've been the biggest market company in the world. And you'd say like a fossil fuel
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.920]  company like Exxon has fallen way down on the list by the year 2022. You'd say, yeah,
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.120]  that makes sense. And not like in any kind of, yeah, but not in any kind of
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:32.880]  Greenpeace left-wing super environmentalism perspective, just it seemed inevitable, right?
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:39.920]  It doesn't make any sense to anybody, even if you're, in my opinion, on the wrong side of
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:46.000]  where we should be policy-wise on fossil fuels and worrying collectively about climate change,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.360]  et cetera. You can't be a serious person and think that a hundred years from now,
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.280]  vehicles are going to be running by burning fossil fuels. At some point they're going away,
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:02.880]  whereas what Microsoft was doing, and literally their name, they're focused on software,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:10.880]  it certainly seemed like it had a bright, no end on the horizon to where software is going to be
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:17.040]  relevant. You'd say, okay, sure. I'm sure Microsoft will be very relevant. And to hear that in 2022,
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:21.440]  they're still one of the biggest most profitable and successful companies in the world.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.200]  No surprise to me, but if you found out their biggest acquisition by far,
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:34.720]  like by over 2x, was a video game studio, you would be like, what? I don't know that adds up
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:40.640]  to me, my perspective on where the world was going 20 years ago, even though at the time I
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.920]  was a video game fan, literally bought, I think the last console I bought for myself before I
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:51.760]  became a father and let my kid pick the consoles was the original Xbox.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:59.120]  Yeah. Was that, oh my God, this was another fucking tangent. Was that
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.160]  difficult for you? Because there's just from old Mac people and myself, although I wasn't
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.920]  a Mac person back in the nineties, there's an animosity towards Microsoft. Like they were doing
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:16.240]  shitty shit that was not that cool. I think when Microsoft invested, I don't know what it was, like
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.480]  $85 in Mac, like it was such a building amount. I think it was like 180 million.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.600]  I think it was 150, but it was nothing. It was so tiny. And just backstory on that,
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:34.720]  Windows media stuff had used a lot of QuickTime based code and there was a bunch of lawsuits
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.640]  going on and it was basically like, okay, how about you give us a bunch of money and pretend
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:43.840]  that you, not pretend, but agree to keep doing Office and we'll just call it quits and move on.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:48.400]  And Steve has to get up there and be like, hey, look, from Apple to win, Microsoft doesn't have
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:54.160]  to lose, which is one of the most familiar things he's ever said. I know, I know. Which is great.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.640]  That was great guidance. That's amazing. And guess what? Look at the world today,
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.000]  number one and number two in market cap, Apple and Microsoft, I believe.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.640]  Yeah. Whatever the animosity is. It actually was true. It was not difficult for me.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:17.920]  And I know, I think we mentioned it. Syracuse, I believe, has never owned an Xbox because,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.400]  and I believe that he erred on the side of distaste for them.
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.520]  I think he's still a bit about buying Halo. Like they bought Budgie.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.160]  Remember, that was a real thumb in the eye.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.800]  Oh yeah. Because, well, Marathon was the last game, the last 3D shooter I was good at.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:42.720]  Which really dates me. But I was really good at Marathon and I was really into it. But yeah,
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.280]  them buying Budgie hurt as a Mac user because Halo, I believe, was going to date, was,
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:52.960]  before they bought them, was going to be a Mac exclusive, but it was going to debut on the Mac.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.640]  Yeah. It was a showcase of the power of Macs, right? The power PC plus, I think,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.480]  ATI cards at the time, like ATI whatever, H128, something like that.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:10.160]  Yeah. Here's my story on console. So, I never liked the NES. And I never thought the games
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:16.960]  were that great. I was never into the classic, original 8-bit NES Mario. I was never good at it.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.680]  Never thought the graphics were that good. And I so despised that sharp corner rectangular controller
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.800]  that, obviously, I never owned one, but some of my friends did. And I felt like I couldn't play for
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.720]  more than 15 minutes without my hands hurting. And I was, you know, like 14 at the time. And so,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.480]  my whole body was made out of rubber. I was like, who makes a controller like this? It was bananas
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:46.640]  how uncomfortable it was. In college, I was an enormous, I was a Sega Genesis maniac and
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:54.480]  loved the Genesis. But it was just like Mac versus PC, where it's Sega on one side and Nintendo on
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.480]  the other. And I was on Team Sega and totally skipped the Super NES for the same reason.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:09.360]  And then in 1996 or 97 or so, bought the Nintendo 64 because there was no Nintendo or Sega rival at
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.800]  the time. Again, I wasn't religious about it. I was like open-minded. It was like, I'd been
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.320]  not on the Team Nintendo, but Nintendo 64 looked so cool. And actually, my roommate was the same
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.480]  guy who I was talking about. The guy who didn't like Heat, but I liked Heat. But we bought a
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.880]  Nintendo 64. And I guess this was actually the last 3D shooter I was good at was Goldeneye.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.600]  The Nintendo 64, James Bond. You went out on top, man. That is a good game.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.840]  The greatest, it's the two greatest moments of my video game playing life. I will tell them to.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:52.480]  In 1990... No, I forget who. We'd mix it up. But 1992, my sophomore year of college,
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.880]  I had a Mac LC that came with this crappy keyboard. I forget what it was called,
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.960]  but it was a real turd of a keyboard. And my arch rival for John Madden football on Sega Genesis
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:12.240]  was a guy who had an SE30, which is what I should have bought instead of the LC. But the SE30
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.680]  came with the Apple Extended Keyboard 2, which is still to this day my favorite keyboard ever made.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.200]  And we made a bet. And we were arch rivals. I played with the Houston Oilers,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.280]  who in real world were not a great football team, but they had a quarterback named Warren Moon,
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:34.640]  who in Madden football had unbelievable stats. And my friend, I actually forget his name,
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.680]  but he played as the Eagles, who had this incredible defense. I had the team with this
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.480]  unbelievable superhuman quarterback. He had a team with this incredible defense. And
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:54.800]  we played one game, winner takes all. Either I get his keyboard, or if I lost, I pay him $100 cash.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.080]  And you might think, wait for a keyboard. But those keyboards were like $200 retail.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.720]  And so he could use his computer, I would give him my keyboard. I won the game, got the keyboard,
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.560]  and wound up using that keyboard until 2006 or 2007 or something like that. All the early years,
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.480]  every word ever written on Daring Fireball in the early years, written on that keyboard that I won
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.440]  in a 1992 game of John Madden football on Sega Genesis. My second greatest moment...
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:23.680]  Man, I did not know that. I knew you loved that keyboard.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.480]  Oh, and it was a good game.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.520]  I didn't know the origin story of it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.600]  Oh, it was a great...
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.880]  Man, that's like taking your sword from a defeated enemy or something.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.520]  Oh, it was like I had him the whole game. It wasn't a blowout, but I was never...
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.560]  He never got within threatening distance, and he knew it. So the whole fourth quarter,
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.240]  he knew he was going to lose. It was terrible.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:42.640]  Was he doing...
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.680]  And then the other one was...
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.640]  I don't know, man.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.520]  Again, tangent.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.520]  Crazy long bong moves, like just...
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.720]  No, well...
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.400]  Did he play by the book, or did he be like, I'm losing it, I got to do something decisive?
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.960]  No, I think his only chance to have come back would have been to get a turnover. He would have
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.720]  had to come in and sack the quarterback, get a fumble, and pick it up and run it in. And I just...
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.120]  I kept scoring, and he couldn't catch up. That was great. But then maybe my better moment was
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.960]  playing Goldeneye with my then roommate. And for the longest time... Now, did you have Goldeneye?
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.080]  Did you have a Nintendo 64?
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:21.200]  I would go over to my buddy Casey's house and play Goldeneye. I would rent one. I would enjoy it.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:24.960]  But I was programming games at that point, I think.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:26.400]  Poorly.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.880]  But my thing was programming rather than playing.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.840]  Goldeneye was amazing. It was a recreation of the Goldeneye movie on Nintendo 64,
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:43.280]  only on Nintendo 64. And in the one-player mode was you playing as James Bond and more or less
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.040]  going through all the missions of the movie. And it looked great. And the one-player mode
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:51.520]  was fantastic and would have been well worth the price of the cartridge by itself. But the
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.120]  two-player mode was unbelievable. Now, because it was a Nintendo game and there was no networking at
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:02.080]  the time, you played split-screen. It was, I think, jeez, top-bottom? Four.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.680]  I think it was top-bottom, not left.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.480]  It was top-bottom, and then cut down to four. Here's the thing.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.480]  Oh, it did go four.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.400]  Except, you know what? I was watching this at 2.30 in the morning the other day when I might
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.080]  have been having a holiday party, so I didn't text you. But I watched a YouTuber about the creation,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.840]  like, the development of Goldeneye, and the multiplayer was jammed in at the last minute.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.840]  Oh, I believe it. I'm writing in Showtope. YouTube Goldeneye.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.560]  I'm going to look up the link. It's in my YouTube history.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.840]  It kind of felt like...
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.400]  You need to watch it. Honestly, if we're having this discussion, it is remarkable how cool
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:44.240]  you can add just weird little features that come in at the last minute that really make it.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.800]  Because that game is famous for the multiplayer.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.960]  Right. Well, and it ties into the Madden story, because Madden was multiplayer on the same screen,
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:59.440]  too. And they had these features in Madden where you would want to be deceptive. You could watch
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.160]  which plays the guy you were playing against were picking. And we had both, if you were an
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.960]  obsessive player, you knew the whole playbook, and you knew all the plays. And so they let you,
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:15.040]  like, as each successive year, there'd be like one year where the multiplayer was like,
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.000]  oh, this is a big problem, because everybody can see what their opponent picks. And they let it be
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:28.240]  that you could keep cycling through the plays after you made your selection, and it wouldn't
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:35.600]  beep and tell you which one you picked. If I was playing you, and I get to the play I want to call,
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.000]  and I hit the button that says, this is the one I'm going to run, or the defense I'm going to run,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.120]  but then I can keep picking plays for a couple more seconds and cycle through them. So you don't
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.120]  know which one I picked. You can't count the clicks, so it's like one, two, three, four,
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:53.680]  and yeah, that's awesome. And you would know how to get to the one you wanted very quickly and go
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.120]  very fast, and it worked out. But the GoldenEye was so interesting where you're playing split
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.120]  screen with somebody, and you can see where they are because you could just look at the other half
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.720]  of the screen. But they could do the same to you, so it was fair. It was very weird. But
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.520]  my roommate and I were dead even players for the longest time, and we loved playing. We played
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.560]  like every day, and we were like 50-50, and something happened over there. And it was
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:25.200]  definitely summer, as the story will indicate. It was summer, and somehow something clicked,
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:31.360]  and I got like a fraction of a second better than my roommate. And no matter what happened,
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:37.040]  I started winning every match. And even when it was like he'd see me, and he'd be going to shoot
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:42.880]  me in the head, and boom, I got him in the head, and he's dead every time. And for months and
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.400]  months, we were like dead even, and all of a sudden, he could not beat me every time. And I
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:53.920]  don't know, all of a sudden, one time, he got so frustrated, he ripped the controller out of the
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.520]  thing and threw it over his head. And it was summer. We had the window open because it was hot,
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.400]  and it sailed out the window, and we lived on the third floor, and it just went right out the window
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:12.000]  and shattered on the sidewalk. And it was the most satisfying victory. I mean, he didn't
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.520]  purposefully throw it out the window, but it literally, by accident, went out the window,
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:26.160]  shattered. And it was comical, it was a moment of levity, and then we just, he had a car, I didn't,
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:31.920]  we just got in the car and drove down to Walmart and bought another controller, because he was
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.320]  because he was like being a, like a gambling addict. It's, you just busted, and you get your
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.240]  car, you go to the bank, get some more money out of the ATM and go back to the casino. It's like,
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.080]  well, let's go get another controller. Okay. Anyway, so I had an intention.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:52.240]  Wait, then there's a negativity there, right? There's a, is gaming valued so highly because
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.320]  it is a gambling form, and is subscription to gaming a part of that parcel? I don't,
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.800]  maybe you want it to have more fun. Honestly, I would laugh at you all day about dumb video
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:11.440]  game stories, but it's a $69 billion valuation because video games have become a form of
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.720]  feedback that gamblers get that is now being subsumed in a subscription model.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:26.560]  I, I worry a lot about the pay to win games. And that's part of, part of Microsoft's purchase is
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:31.200]  not just like the Call of Duty and stuff like that, but they get King, which has Candy Crush,
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.320]  and Candy Crush is about as close as you can get to a slot machine without being a slot machine.
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.960]  Yeah, the thing goes where it ended up being the same way too. Yeah.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:44.080]  But I don't feel the same way about a subscription. I know, and World of Warcraft
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.200]  is the big subscription service that, that Microsoft will get, assuming the Activision
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.640]  thing goes through, and it's 15 bucks a month. But you can't, if you, the more you get into it,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.520]  it's still 15 bucks a month. It's a time sink that you might be able to spend an unhealthy
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.200]  amount of time playing, but you can't spend more than $15 a month, which isn't that bad.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.000]  Alright, let's take a break. I'm going to take a break here and thank our next sponsor. It's our

[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.440]  Where were we? What were we talking about?
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.960]  Here's the thing. We've talked a little bit, well, we've talked around the fact that 69 billion for
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:21.520]  Activision Blizzard is a whole bunch of money. At the same time, it feels like you're buying
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:30.160]  some diamonds surrounded by shit that is on fire on your doorstep, right? The doorstep is that it's
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:34.320]  been delivered to you in a way in that, guess what? The stock prices have to amount of money
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.640]  amount of money you might've thought about doing. By the way, Ben Thompson does a much better and
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:44.960]  more mature take on this stuff. But basically the bag is on fire. There's some diamonds in there,
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.880]  and there's a bunch of shit around it. Choose your own adventure from there effectively.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:56.240]  Well, obviously there's a nice selection of IP, very popular games that have proven to be popular
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.480]  for a longterm. Obviously there's a lot of talent at the game design and engineering
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:08.960]  level. And the problems, the cultural problems, the lawsuit they have from the state of California,
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:15.360]  which Ben and I have emphasized, it's bad enough if it's individual lawsuits, like some employee
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:24.160]  who feels legitimately was slighted or subjected to bad behavior. You can buy your way out of a
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.800]  problem like that by settling a lawsuit. Whereas when the state of California is coming after you,
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:34.480]  it's not good, to say the least. And yet there still are a successful, proud company,
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:41.920]  and how do you get out of it? To me, it is. And I do feel like Microsoft knew it. This is my take,
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.960]  is Microsoft knew it. It's like, where else are they going to go? Their way out is to sell. Their
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.680]  stock is depressed because of these scandals, legitimately. And that's not, this isn't like
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:57.520]  Microsoft of old, where they sandbagged the company, but it was an opportunity for Microsoft
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:05.280]  to buy somebody who they might've wanted to buy anyway at full price a year ago. And now you can
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:13.440]  get them at 50 or 40% discount. To his great credit, Ben calls out the, I'm kind of black on
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:21.840]  his name, because they elevated him too. Phil Spencer. Phil Spencer. Thank you. I had Phil
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.560]  Spencer in my mind and not the same people. But he's been elevated. His title is now CEO
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:32.000]  of gaming at Microsoft. That's how Siri, and again, the $69 billion price tag shows how serious
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:37.440]  Microsoft is as a whole. And the fact that they've given Phil Spencer the title of CEO of gaming.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:45.200]  But is that even a separate business unit? I guess. CEO is some made up name anyway.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:51.840]  But it is interesting that everybody is spinning this in a quote unquote metaverse context.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:57.680]  And it's just a word people are saying right now. But it is from an actual,
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:05.440]  hey, what are the practical implications? It is interesting that Xbox doesn't really have a VR
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:12.320]  story at the moment. As opposed to PlayStation, which does, there is an actual PlayStation
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.200]  headset that you can buy and hook up to your PlayStation and play VR games. And Xbox doesn't
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.840]  have it, but Microsoft does, right? With the HoloLens project, which has been high profile
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:26.720]  and it's very high fidelity. So obviously that needs to come together, right? Like the part of
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:33.760]  Microsoft working on HoloLens and the part that is spending $69 billion to buy Activision Blizzard
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:41.040]  need to get together. I suppose where... First of all, I don't necessarily think that the
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:48.320]  headlines that are calling out this as a, for lack of a better term, a metaverse play, I don't think
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:56.000]  this is necessarily reactionary to Facebook's moves. I do think that, yeah, I think Microsoft
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:03.360]  wanted to buy this company at maybe full price. And once it got to half price, somebody could
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.240]  walk into a room and be like, look, we were considering this kind of move earlier. It's
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:16.240]  half price now. Let's just do it. That said, the metaverse angle, which keeps coming up,
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:24.720]  is one of delivery, which is the eyewear, the mask and face, the immersion aspect of it.
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.120]  The other side of that is making servers that can hold that many people interacting in that
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:41.600]  many ways. And that is a different problem than Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.640]  anything that's gone before. It's a real time non-deterministic, by which I mean there's a
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:55.920]  lot of UDP traffic often going on there. You never know exactly where a character is at
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.160]  any given time and you need to interpolate and make it all work out. What we were talking about
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  Golda Meir, although that was all working on one machine, a multiplayer aspect is very
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:12.720]  difficult to coordinate and very different from a single viewer sort of perspective.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:19.520]  And if you think about Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or anything like that, or RSS
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:24.720]  feeds like we were talking about earlier, is that they are a series of sequential events.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:37.040]  And the truth is that in, I'll just say metaverse, in a massively multiplayer online
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:44.080]  game is that events can come in that happened prior to the current timestamp. And you need
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:49.760]  to reconcile that kind of stuff. And that is a more interesting avenue towards metaversy
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:57.120]  stuff than I think how fast you, well, the fact that Activision Blizzard doesn't have
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:05.040]  presentation hardware or software tuned to doing so does not make them ineligible to
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:10.720]  be a great piece in an ongoing multiplayer world, right? Like you need to reconcile so
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:15.840]  many things on the internet to make things appear normal. And they've got, what is it,
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.960]  15 years of doing? I can't even remember when will the Warcraft launch, but they're
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.520]  good.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.800]  I hate to keep singing Ben Thompson's praises on this show.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.000]  Yeah, me too. I don't like that guy.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.840]  Alas, his interview with Phil Spencer the day after was amazing. And the one thing I
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:36.080]  forgot to mention on Dithering, but I will just say here, I might mention the next time
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:41.920]  we do Dithering is it's a fantastic example where he does these interviews that are available
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:48.560]  to his Stratechery subscribers. You can read it as a transcript or listen to it as a podcast.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.000]  And listening to it was so much more interesting to me than reading the transcript would have
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.640]  been because you could sense a certain ebullence in Phil Spencer's voice. He was in a good
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.840]  mood after this deal was announced. And I know it's not approved.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.560]  He should be.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:08.960]  But I found it very interesting to just listen to his tone. And when Ben asked him about
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.240]  the VR question, I thought his answer, it did not seem to me like one way to look at
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:20.800]  it is, okay, if you don't have a story about X, then you deflect. And a perfect example
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:27.040]  of that would be back when Apple announced the color iPods that you could hook up to
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.520]  your photo library. So in addition to just showing album art and color, you could put
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:38.240]  your photos on your iPod. And literally after the keynote where they announced Dithering,
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.360]  the first question Steve Jobs was asked by somebody in the media who got to see him in
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.960]  the hands-on areas, hey, what about video? This iPod photo or whatever they called it
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:55.440]  didn't play video. And they were obviously thinking about it because they were renting
[01:28:55.440 --> 01:29:00.800]  TV shows and stuff on iTunes at the time. And a year later, they came out with an iPod
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:06.080]  that played video. But Jobs deflected and said, ah, nobody wants to watch video on a
[01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:11.120]  screen this size. It was a total deflection. And Jobs was the master of it. You could
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:17.680]  write a whole book about times that Steve Jobs was asked about X because Apple didn't
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.960]  have X yet. And he said, ah, nobody wants to do X. And then a year later, Apple comes
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.760]  out and acts like they invented X, whatever it was.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:31.280]  Well, I'm completely positive that his rationale is like, nobody wants to do X. And he
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:36.080]  didn't finish the sentence at the end of the sentence because it sucks.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:36.880]  Phil Spencer's...
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:44.560]  Hang on a second. One of the three prongs of the iPhone, I was about to say iPod, the
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:53.360]  iPhone introduction was widescreen iPod. Is that really, is that a stool that you
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.280]  want to sit on these days? Probably not.
[01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.040]  I know. But at the time, if you wanted to watch an episode, I'm thinking,
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.280]  at the time, Lost was a big hit. You could only watch it on the tiny two-inch iPod
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.320]  screen. And so the idea that it would be a three and a half inch diagonal widescreen,
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.320]  it really was a big deal.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:17.440]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's a reason David Lynch is never going to do anything for
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.160]  Apple TV.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:23.120]  I know that I was just watching that part of the keynote again, too, because I think
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:26.880]  we just hit the 15th anniversary or something, and everybody was watching it. And
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:31.280]  there's the... It's just such... We can't say it as many times. It's the canonical
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.960]  Apple keynote. It's the one that everybody was always waiting for. They're never
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:40.240]  going to reproduce it. And that it's not three products, it's one product. Are you
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.880]  getting it? It was a fantastic way of presenting it. But the widescreen video
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.760]  iPod was actually an appealing product. If it had been its own product, it would have
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.520]  been a huge deal.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.360]  I do think that, but I have to feel... Well, given hindsight, I feel like that was
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:59.120]  shoehorned in to make a rule of threes, never a thing, rather than...
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:06.480]  But it is like thinking back to, I don't know, 1989, and somebody at Apple saying,
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.360]  the Mac 2, whatever the first one was, can do color.
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.760]  It was.
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.760]  You have to admit, if you'd been a Mac user for five years, the fact that it could
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:22.080]  do color, even if it was limited to 16 colors, was a big step up, because
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.480]  previously every pixel was either black or white, and that was it. But in
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.280]  hindsight, it does not seem like something to brag about. A widescreen video
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.200]  iPod does not seem like a bragging point, but at the time, it seemed like a big
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:35.360]  deal.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.720]  So, Spencer.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:40.720]  The thing that got me about Spencer's answer about the metaverse in VR was him
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.080]  more... I didn't think it was deflecting. I thought it was actually very
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.960]  insightful, and it makes me think, oh man, he is the right person to have as the
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:55.040]  CEO of gaming at a company like Microsoft, was basically... I'm paraphrasing
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.440]  a lot here, but basically, hey, screens are screens, and VR screens and headsets
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.000]  are awesome, and they're great, and we're looking at them. TVs, monitors,
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:08.960]  phones, tablets, they're all screens, and the metaverse is all of that. You
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.680]  might be on any of those screens at any given point, or no screen, and still be
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:19.680]  participating in some other way. I thought that was super insightful. I
[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:24.240]  really do. There's nothing magic about a VR headset. It is obviously different,
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:32.640]  but it's only different in the way that a giant 70-inch TV is different than a
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.680]  four-inch phone.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:36.640]  So, yeah.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:41.280]  To underscore something that you said earlier, Microsoft is all about
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.280]  software, right? And he specifically says that hardware that you're running
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:51.600]  on is not really relevant. And the doubling down of like, it's not Windows
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.480]  everywhere, it's Microsoft everywhere. And if that is what they call xCloud,
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.840]  which I find hilariously Microsoft named, like I've come... I honestly have,
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.720]  I swear to God, I've come to admire Microsoft in the past 10-ish years,
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:10.480]  kind of thing. I really do. Their naming has always been hilariously bad,
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:14.240]  and I find that sort of charming. Like, I've come around and I'm like, okay,
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.680]  xCloud. I get it. I get it.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:22.320]  The funniest to me was back when we were doing Vesper, and Azure was
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:26.000]  Windows Azure. It had nothing to do with Windows. Nothing!
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.480]  They don't know how to name anything. They have no idea. And like, xCloud is
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:36.720]  okay, I see you took Apple's thing and stuck an x in it. And Xbox is a
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.040]  horrible... Do you know what a great name is? PlayStation. That is an
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:44.880]  amazing... That's a good name. What do you want to do here? You want to play
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:50.320]  stuff? DVDs, Blu-rays, games. You got it. Not a problem. The Nintendo
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:57.120]  Entertainment System, equally, okay, nerdy, but any more nerdy than VHS,
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.240]  right? Like video home.
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.320]  Switch is a great name.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.520]  Switch is a great name.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.360]  The Wii was pulled out of nothing, but it worked. It was memorable.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.760]  The charm to it that they can get away with shit like that.
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:15.440]  Sony, 90% of their stuff is named like the XDS 757, but when they come
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.040]  up with a hit name, like Trinitron, it was like, oh man. Because if you
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.880]  didn't have a Trinitron display, your display was crap. You knew it was...
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:27.440]  It helps that it was good stuff and cool name.
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.400]  Walkman, man, Walkman.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.320]  Walkman is honestly, I swear to God, that's probably the...
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.640]  That's got to be in the top five things ever produced in 100 years.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.600]  Yeah, no idea where they came up with it.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:47.920]  Well, we've got the atom bomb, so that's not good. But in terms of a
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.320]  consumer product, Walkman is pretty revolutionary.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.920]  Yeah, and I don't know why. It sounds good. It was memorable. And rather
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.920]  than focus on anything related to sound or audio or music, it was the fact
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.760]  that you could walk around. That was the thing. It was like they keyed in
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.080]  on the actual thing that was different from everything that came before.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.080]  Do you think they were riffing off Pac-Man?
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.960]  No, I don't think so. But it's hard to say because it did come after, but I
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.880]  don't think. But it would be interesting to know.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.380]  Anyway.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.400]  All right, let me take a break here. Thank our third and final sponsor,
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.080]  and we'll head into the homestretch. It's our good friends at Memberful.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:36.000]  Hey, you can monetize your passion with memberships. It allows you as a
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.760]  creator to build a sustainable, recurring revenue. It is the easiest
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.920]  way to sell memberships to your audience, and it is used by some of the
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.720]  biggest creators on the web. And Memberful has everything you need to
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.840]  run a membership program, including custom branding. Your brand is out in
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:59.040]  front, not Memberful. Gift subscriptions, Apple Pay, free trials,
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.080]  private podcasts just for your members. They make it easy to do that and
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.480]  tons more, and they seamlessly integrate with the tools that you already
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.880]  use, things like WordPress. You have full control and ownership of your
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.160]  audience. If you ever want to move away from Memberful, you can take your
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.760]  audience with you. They're confident. They're not trying to lock you in.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.040]  They're confident that you're going to want to stay with Memberful, and
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.320]  they make it possible to move the whole thing away if you want to. You're
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.240]  not locked in. They have a world-class support team that is ready to help
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.680]  you simplify your memberships and grow your revenue, because they only
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:38.640]  make money when you make money by building your membership system. And
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.280]  you can get started for free with no credit card required up front. It's a
[01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.520]  great system used by some of my favorite friends. Literally, my friends
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:54.400]  use it. Jason Snell at Six Colors, the whole crew at Relay.fm, a bunch
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.360]  of podcasts, just absolutely terrific. I'm subscribed to more Memberful
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.960]  subscriptions than I probably want to even know about, because I just love
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.800]  the creators who use it. Here's where you go to find out more. If you
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:13.760]  want to get started and monetize your audience, go to memberful, M-E-M-B-E-R-F-U-L,
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:21.040]  memberful.com slash talk show. Today, that's memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.760]  Any of the podcasts you do on the old Memberful?
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.840]  Do you know what? I was about to interject, because I didn't know if you
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.400]  wanted my colleagues. Pull a Merlin. What happened? Did you fall down?
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.160]  No, I got so excited about your sponsor that I managed to knock my microphone
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.800]  off my desk. So I do a podcast on The Incomparable called Biff, which is
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:46.800]  about superheroes. And yeah, The Incomparable uses Memberful. And the
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:52.640]  way that it works is that subscribers can basically vote on the shows that
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.080]  they want to listen to and donate a portion of their money to. And at least
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.920]  that's the way that The Incomparable does it. And it's great. It's been
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.480]  working out wonderfully. To be perfectly honest, I do not see that money. I
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.520]  don't take any of that money. I don't. Well, because I'm in Canada, it's a
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.720]  huge pain in the ass. And for a while I was at Apple and I didn't know how
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.880]  that was going to work and whatever. I just, I didn't feel like having to
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:25.680]  deal with that. Guess what, John, if you want to drink, hit up malts and
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:28.880]  just say it's on Guy's tab, it's probably going to work out for you.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.720]  But yeah, as far as I know, everything's been going great and it has, it's
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.280]  a tricky problem to solve because I think what we're, and it's a little
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.160]  bit weird because the Microsoft Activision Blizzard thing is going
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.520]  into subscription stuff and I think a lot more stuff is going into
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:53.680]  subscription stuff and I want to disassociate this from that. But a
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:39:00.080]  company or a sort of approach that allows a broader audience to
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:05.200]  participate in a subscription model is worthwhile, I think. Not necessarily
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.240]  because I don't necessarily think that everything you're going to do is
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.920]  going to make any money, and that's fine. But being able to participate
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.440]  in an economy where you can make subscription money, I think is
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.560]  valuable in some way. And it's a weird shift.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.760]  Well, I'll just say this, like, I kind of want to pivot out of a work
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.360]  thing or like an ad thing here and into, obviously you run a
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.560]  subscription site, Ben Webb's run a subscription site. A lot of people
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:39.200]  do. ATP has subscribers. There's a lot of stuff like that. I think,
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.600]  and I realize this is a sponsor and I don't necessarily want to
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:48.240]  associate the two, but OnlyFans has come up based on subscription
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.160]  stuff. I think Twitter has a lot of attachment due to subscribing to
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:58.560]  a certain point of view. And it's an interesting perspective on value,
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:03.040]  right? It's value over time versus value through like an item.
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:08.720]  Well, I know that there's a lot of people who are resistant to the
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.800]  trend towards subscriptions for everything. I get it. And I think it's
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.240]  always hard to move something to subscriptions. Again, the sponsor
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:18.720]  read for Memberful is over, but we can talk about it because it does
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:24.960]  play into the game. It really does. And to me, my mindset, and I say
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.680]  this, I've got dithering, which is entirely subscription based, and
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:32.480]  it's doing very well. It's very popular. Seems more popular than way
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.720]  more popular than like the minimum. Hey, if it gets to this point, we'll
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.120]  call it a success. It's higher than that, which is great. And I enjoy
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:44.560]  doing it. And I think it's a fair price. But the stuff I do at Daring
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:48.880]  Fireball is non-subscription now. Even though I mentioned before, I was
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.320]  doing subscription stuff back in 2004. Maybe I'll bring it back in some
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.840]  form. I've been thinking about it. I like the idea though that everything
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:01.360]  I do at Daring Fireball, every single word I write in every single second
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.000]  of this podcast is free for anybody without a subscription. I enjoy that
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.840]  too. And the sponsorship stuff has made that financially more than
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:16.960]  feasible. But I like this. When I was a kid, here's the thing I want to
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.360]  point out. I just want to say when I was a kid, the only people who had
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:24.480]  subscriptions were huge institutions. Like in even like the local
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.320]  newspaper in Reading, Pennsylvania, where I grew up, it was the biggest
[01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:33.760]  political force or social force in the county. The local newspaper was a
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:38.240]  big deal. Everybody I knew had a subscription to the paper and the
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.760]  cable company. That's it. And the phone, you subscribe effectively to
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.600]  telephone service. AT&T, they're literally so big that they were the
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:50.560]  last monopoly truly busted up by the federal government. That's who had
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.880]  subscriptions. It's a great business. It's so great now that anybody can
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.400]  do it for three bucks a month or five bucks a month or something like
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.800]  that. And it's easy to unsubscribe. The difference between the old days
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.000]  was nobody could really unsubscribe from the phone service because who
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.440]  could afford to not have a telephone.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.360]  Right. And I guess that, well, a few things about that, but that actually
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.440]  brings us to our next topic.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:15.920]  It does.
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:22.400]  It does. Yeah. People believe that subscriptions are bad, but
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:30.160]  inherently it is a vote of confidence month by month. And I think where I
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:35.360]  want to take this conversation is to Netflix, where the sky is falling.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.120]  Is that where you thought we were going to go?
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.240]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:46.160]  Even in the article that I read, C901, was that this feels more so, I
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.920]  guess, background, Netflix dropped, what, 40 some odd percent over the
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.480]  past X weeks. It was bad.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.800]  Yeah, since November, yeah. Their stock has dropped like 40 percent.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.440]  It felt precipitous because, guess what, everybody was signing up for
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.320]  Netflix and post-hunts. Another thing, I guess, we can talk about. And the
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:09.040]  notion is that, well, Netflix, the sky is falling, was a headline on CNN.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.240]  And no, it's not. No, it's not.
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:18.160]  Because their subscriber base only grew 9 percent. And I get it. I'm not
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.240]  making light of the fact that if everybody was investing in Microsoft in
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.120]  October, thinking it was going to be 20 percent and it's only 9 percent
[01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:30.640]  growth instead of 20, that is a disappointment and therefore the stock
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.400]  price will drop as a result. I get it.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.280]  You said Microsoft, you meant Netflix.
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.080]  I meant Netflix, but I meant, yeah.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.360]  Yeah. Who cares? It doesn't matter. Because here's the thing. If you read
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.440]  that article, the notion is, well, eventually everybody's going to tap out
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.160]  of people to subscribe. It's like, yeah. I don't know if you've noticed the
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:55.280]  planet. There's a limit. There's a limit here. That's right.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:02.800]  Right. And 220 million subscribers and growing, even if more slowly than
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  previously expected. I don't know anybody who is, ah, Netflix, I'm going
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.840]  to cancel.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.800]  It's insane.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:14.640]  It's a really good business from a company. And I say this, I have a
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:18.880]  friend or two who work there, but I have the utmost respect for them. I
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:23.520]  think they have a great strategy. I think their software is excellent,
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.080]  which really to me counts for something. And a lot of others, I'll just
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.280]  name it because I don't know anybody who works at Hulu, but something
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.760]  happened to our, we have a shared family Hulu account. And you know how
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:39.360]  all these streaming services let you set up like family profiles so like
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:44.640]  Amy, John, and Jonas can each have like their own history and shared,
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.960]  remember where you took off. And so I'm not watching what Jonas was just
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.640]  watching or whatever. Well, whatever happened, I'm the owner of the Hulu
[01:44:52.640 --> 01:45:00.640]  account and my username is blank. It is the less than symbol, lowercase
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:06.320]  B-L-A-N-K, greater than symbol. And there's nothing I can do to change it.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.320]  There, I cannot fix it. Can't make it say John, can't delete it because
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.560]  it's the master. I guess I could cancel. Something happened. So there's
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:16.320]  John. No, I didn't do it.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.200]  That does not seem even a joke that you would do.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.320]  No, but who cares? I don't care. What do I care?
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.480]  You're doing blowfield 69420.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.240]  It's not I've written a book and it's going into the Library of Congress
[01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.880]  for history under the name blank. It's my name in our shared family Hulu
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.960]  account. But it just speaks to the quality of Hulu's software, which is
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:43.680]  honestly not great. And from a user experience perspective to remembering
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:48.240]  and being able to change your username, Netflix is great. And they have great
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:52.480]  exclusive content and a great library of shared content. Amy and I are
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:57.360]  actually mowing through Seinfeld, which I haven't watched since it was on.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.760]  And they spent a fortune to get the exclusive streaming rights to Seinfeld
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:07.200]  recently. Money well spent. It's great. I wouldn't think, I've never given
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:12.000]  two thoughts to canceling our Netflix subscription. And I complained, and
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.360]  you can complain about little details like that you have to spend, you have
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:20.240]  to be on their premium plan, which is 20 bucks a month to get 4K. And
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.760]  otherwise at 15 bucks a month, you're stuck at 1080p. And their $10 plan
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:30.800]  ridiculously is only 480p. I think that I complain about. That's nobody
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.640]  should be getting 480p video.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.160]  Do you think they're doing the same sort of miscalculation that you did
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.120]  earlier when you were like, well, the linked list items happen 24 hours
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:43.760]  later?
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.280]  Yeah, I think a little.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.040]  They're trying to like, yeah, we can monetize this. Is it a detriment to
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:49.440]  do that?
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:54.000]  I think a little bit. But on their plus side, one of the things Netflix
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.840]  has to me spearheaded is a sort of open-mindedness about, okay, this
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:06.960]  account, this one paid account that has a credit card on file and that
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:13.280]  every 30 days or once a month, the charge goes through. It has an email
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.280]  and it has a password and more than one person can technically, if they
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:22.800]  know the password, use that to watch Netflix. They've never policed that
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:28.480]  and tried to cut down on, defined it. And all they do is make sure that
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:32.640]  concurrently there's a limit on the basic plan. Maybe it's one device and
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:37.280]  on the mid range plan, it's two or three. I forget. But it's generous
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:42.480]  enough that to me, nobody who's using it in any reasonable way runs into
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.200]  the limit.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:50.560]  So I think that sort of underscores the first sort of Apple approach to
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.880]  this, which is, well, reasonably you're getting your money, right? Like
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:00.160]  we have sold your songs to iTunes and reasonably everything's going
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:07.920]  okay. And I think it gets back to a little bit of sort of, well, I don't
[01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:15.440]  know. I honestly don't know. But Adobe felt like they were, okay, guess
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  what? Fine. Use Photoshop or Illustrator. We don't like it, but we're
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:26.320]  not going to be adamantly so opposed to it. There is value in sharing,
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:30.720]  right? There's a reason everybody plays Woodle and it has to do with
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.440]  just that cute little share button that is like, innocuously. Hey, guess
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.840]  what? Here's how I did on my last game. It doesn't reveal the result.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:44.800]  There's one result a day, which makes everybody be able to compare
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.480]  each other's, I don't know, baseline, like their guesses. You can see
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:55.680]  somebody else's Woodle puzzle laid out before you and be like, eh, I get
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.080]  where they're going from. And that is an incredibly great hook.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:06.560]  To me, it goes broader and I'm not, I'm pro capitalism. I really am, but
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:09.840]  with limits. It's like everything in moderation. And to me, the secret
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.920]  to a well-balanced society is a balance between lowercase S socialism
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.560]  to keep everybody at a reasonable, every single person at a reasonable
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.120]  level of wellbeing and taking care of them. Nobody dies just for being
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:30.000]  there. Or nobody goes hungry or nobody should not have a warm, safe
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:33.280]  roof over their head. I really do believe that. And there's countries
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.360]  around the world that, you know, and everybody, some people here in the
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:40.880]  United States, I won't say which side of the political spectrum, but one
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.480]  side of the political spectrum really looks as though it's a hellish
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.040]  nightmare living in like Scandinavian countries. And in fact, they're,
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.800]  they both, they really do manage an incredible balance of social programs
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:00.240]  to keep everybody at a certain pretty good, minimal level of wellbeing and
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.880]  truly a capitalist economy. It's, it is definitely possible. You can
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.000]  argue about where the balance is, but there's a balance to be found. And
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.440]  we were talking about, I don't know, I don't know, Mad Men, George is
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:18.640]  pretty hot. No, but what I'm saying is I do think though, that taking it
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.680]  too far is the idea that you never actually look at, let's just say
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:27.040]  Netflix is one of the biggest companies in the world at this point by
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.240]  Market Cap. They're a very large, successful company, but at a certain
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.160]  point, you, why can't you look at a company like that and say what they
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.800]  have is a very nice, sustainable business with a bright future ahead
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.280]  and growth is not, doesn't have to be the only thing we look at, right?
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.680]  So this is the thing is that's my point is, and that's where the sky is
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:51.920]  falling. CNN business take on Netflix really got under my skin. I
[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.360]  agree. Why can't you say Netflix is big enough that if their business
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:59.600]  is focused on providing top-notch streaming entertainment over the
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:04.160]  internet, that they're big enough and yes, you want to make sure they
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:08.560]  keep going and it's shrinking would obviously be bad, but as long as
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.000]  they're not shrinking this, they're clearly tops, right? They've got
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.720]  twice the subscriber base of Disney Plus. That's Disney. The old
[01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:21.680]  argument about, hey, Netflix is in a race to become HBO faster than HBO
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:25.920]  can become Netflix. Well, Netflix obviously won that race and I think
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:30.560]  HBO is doing a pretty good job with HBO Max. HBO I don't think is dying.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:34.720]  I think they're managing this transition well, but Netflix clearly
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:40.800]  eclipsed them. They're the number one thing of this sort. How is that
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.440]  not a good place to be? And we get, instead we get the sky is falling
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.440]  because their quarterly growth was 9%. Okay. Is this, am I setting you
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.680]  off? Have I triggered you? Have you triggered me? Well, you haven't
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:00.320]  mentioned anything about Fahrenheit for the past three hours, so you're
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.480]  okay. You're doing okay. Here's the thing. Wall Street is all about
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:09.120]  investment and it should be. That's the job. The job is to invest in
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:15.200]  things that are going to grow and hopefully return reward. That's fine.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:24.480]  The problem in my view comes when a company meets their maturity and
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:30.000]  that they have addressed the problem at hand and there is no more growth
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:39.280]  to be had. If you sell win like wing sockets of a certain diameter and
[01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.960]  you are the best at it and everybody buys your wing sockets, there's only
[01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:46.480]  going to be so many wing sockets in the world that need to be sold.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.720]  And that's going to tank the stock price because it's not going to grow
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:53:00.240]  anymore, which is fine because investment, the word invest means like
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:08.240]  I'm going to give some money and I hope that it's going to grow. You're
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:11.360]  planting a seed and you're hoping that a tree grows. Once the tree is
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.120]  growing and you're like, what the fuck? You're not reaching the moon.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.760]  It's like, yeah, yeah. A tree's never going to reach the moon. There's a
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:23.520]  limit. There's a limit to the number of people that are going to subscribe
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:27.200]  to Netflix or anything else on the planet, whatever you're making. There
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.400]  are only so many people and they're only going to buy so many iPhones.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:37.760]  And ultimately, when, you know, something like Netflix hits a
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:44.800]  subscriber max, is the world falling down on them? No. The world has
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:49.200]  embraced them. They're a part of the world now. Why is that bad?
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:53.680]  I don't understand. You and I have gone off on a tangent or two so far
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:59.440]  this episode, but it does tie together where one of Netflix's, they're
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:03.120]  explicit, they've already launched it, but they're moving into video
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:08.240]  games as part of your Netflix subscription. And it ties into our
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:15.120]  discussion that video games overall have eclipsed the rest of the
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.000]  entertainment complex in terms of where people are spending their time
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.360]  and their money. Netflix seems to have a plan to look at that. And to
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:30.080]  me, again, I don't invest in individual stocks because of what I do. I
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.440]  don't think it's appropriate. If I were, though, Netflix would be a
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.880]  company that I would seriously consider putting money into as an
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:39.760]  individual company because I believe in what they're doing. I think they
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:43.120]  have a great product already. I think they have good leadership. I think
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:48.080]  they have good talent in the company. It just seems like a great
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.360]  company. And I think that looking at video games next as a long-term
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:57.040]  thing, something that you have to think this is not going to show up in
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:55:01.520]  the next three months as a major change, but they're looking at it now
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.640]  in a serious way. And they're still under executive leadership. I know
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.160]  Reed Hastings was there. I think Ted Sarandos was too, but if not,
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.000]  certainly Hastings was, they're still under the same management that
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.280]  managed the transition from Netflix being a company that sent you DVDs
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.600]  and Blu-rays in the mail, which is bananas, right? The company-
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:27.120]  I honestly believe, I swear to God, I'm not even joking, Reed Hastings
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.520]  deserves to be out there with, I don't know, like Gates, Jobs.
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:38.480]  They figured out a- in the world where watching movies at home meant
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:43.200]  spinning laser discs, they figured out a tremendous business model.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.720]  That's adorable that you thought it was laser discs, man.
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:45.680]  Well, you know what I mean though?
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.800]  Laser discs.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.600]  Well, I don't mean laser discs in the capital-
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:51.280]  Oh, discs read by a laser.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:55.600]  Sure. Yeah, like actual DVDs and Blu-rays are fundamentally discs that
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:00.720]  are read by a laser. So I meant capital L, lowercase D, or lowercase L,
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:06.400]  lowercase D laser discs. They figured out a great business model that
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:10.880]  made me, as a user of the old send them in- send them to me in the mail
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.760]  and I'll mail them back to you and you'll send me the next movie at the
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:19.120]  top of my list to a completely digital over-the-wire streaming service.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.800]  They managed it amazingly well. They had that brief hiccup where they
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.120]  were going to rename the mail-in thing to a different name and I forget-
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.520]  what was the name? I forget. It was awful.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:30.400]  I don't know.
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.600]  Farty McFartron.
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:35.520]  But basically their idea at the time, they weren't going to give the future
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:40.880]  of the company the bad name. They wanted to say Netflix, the great name,
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:44.480]  is going to be the future, which is all over the network, and we're going
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:49.440]  to give our legacy mail-your-discs-around thing a goofy name. And people
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:53.360]  freaked out because people- most people couldn't see that the future was
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:56.560]  clearly the streaming thing, whereas they knew it. And I feel they have a
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.560]  plan to continue growing in the future. It's a video game. It's not going
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.760]  to show up in three months. Give them a break. This is ridiculous.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:11.280]  Right. Also, Netflix. What a great name. Just in contrast to the Microsoft
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:14.080]  X cloud. What does that mean? I don't know.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:15.120]  Netflix names of all time.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:20.800]  Is that like, now you support Excel formulas on Google Docs? I don't know.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.200]  I have no idea. I really don't know.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:23.680]  All right.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.240]  I get it.
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:25.920]  Go ahead.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.560]  Homestretch. Right before we recorded that.
[01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:29.680]  Homestretch. Man, are you kidding me?
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:37.120]  I linked to Apple's new ad, Everyone But Jon Hamm. And it's a fantastic
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:40.560]  commercial. Sometimes I feel bad linking to Apple commercials because I
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:42.960]  think, hey, I'm not getting paid to show Apple commercials. Maybe I
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:47.440]  shouldn't be showing it. But it's like, it's a great ad. And I love Jon Hamm.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.080]  And I think people know this, or longtime listeners know, that you and I
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:59.680]  had a years-long thing where, as long distance pals, we would watch new
[01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:04.800]  episodes of Mad Men as they aired together, simultaneous, a couple of
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:08.720]  hundred miles apart. And then we would text each other throughout the show.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:13.520]  It's the whole thing that SharePlay is trying to do now has automated.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:20.000]  And here's the thing I recall. I don't even know. It turns out, so this
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.920]  whole green bubble thing came up. And I'm like, wait a second. I recall
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:29.440]  this with a good friend of mine. I think it was costing like 75 cents a pop.
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.120]  Which is...
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:35.680]  I think iMessage came into play quickly enough, but we started when we
[01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:40.400]  were SMSing each other to do it. And it definitely, it cost us more to send
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:44.800]  our text messages throughout the show than it did to rent the shows on, or
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.560]  buy them on iTunes or whatever. Because the other thing we did, we
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:56.400]  would get them on iTunes. And at the time, iTunes would have new episodes
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:02.240]  of Mad Men 24 hours after they aired on AMC. But the AMC ones, they were
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:09.120]  no good because they had commercials. And I would rather wait 24 hours and
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.720]  pay money than watch the quote unquote free version that came with my
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:16.800]  cable subscription on AMC and skip the commercials. Because it was just,
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.480]  it's too cinematic to spoil with commercials. But then we would both
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:25.120]  spend all of our Mondays like off the internet to avoid any spoilers from
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:26.640]  what had happened on Mad Men.
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:32.320]  Well, here's the thing. Here is where it cemented a little bit was that I
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:38.720]  would avoid Monday entirely. And then I would just start tweeting Mad Men
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:42.880]  quotes. Like we talked about Birdhouse previously, where you would, you'd
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:47.040]  want to workshop a tweet in your own head kind of thing. And then I just
[01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:51.040]  started tweeting, fuck it. I'm just, I'm going to watch Mad Men and just
[01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:56.000]  tweet out quotes. And you were watching them around the same time. And then
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:00.320]  it got, well, let's just do this in private. And so we started texting
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:03.280]  each other and I swear to God, it must've been within three or four
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:07.840]  months. I didn't know Amy that well then, because these days she would
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:11.680]  have just called me up and given me shit. But it was like, look, you're
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:19.520]  costing us a significant amount of money, basically to comment on Mad Men.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:23.840]  And it's not, and John's hung over every Tuesday morning.
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:28.000]  Yeah, Monday is not the weekend.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:36.720]  I swear to God, man, I stopped for the show, but I woke up on it on the
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:41.280]  outside porch with my neighbor walking down with her young daughter and
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:45.440]  a half-drunk glass of Martini in my head. I'm like, oh, hey, how's it
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.520]  going? At like 6 a.m. while they were going to the school. That was,
[02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:51.120]  that was not great.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:58.000]  Roger, Roger taking the stairs after oysters and martinis.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.840]  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Got a little bit too involved with that.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.440]  But anyway, it's a great ad. And my point, I linked to it right before
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:09.280]  we started recording the show, but to me, there's a huge kernel of truth
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:13.680]  to that Apple ad. The gist of the Apple ad, I don't want to, you catch
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.760]  on quick, but the gist of it is John Hamm is in an ad for Apple TV Plus
[02:01:17.760 --> 02:01:21.280]  talking about all these other stars who are in these Apple original
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.520]  content things, and none of them are John Hamm and why not? Hey, Apple,
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:29.280]  what have I ever done to piss you off? And to me, it gets to a point
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.600]  that to me has been lost, which is that Apple slowly but surely, and
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:38.320]  to me, and I know the word quietly gets overused, but quietly is
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:42.640]  building a nice little library of original content that you can only
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:47.280]  get on Apple TV Plus. And the original knock against Apple TV Plus
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:51.040]  was, hey, they've got like three shows and one movie, who the hell is
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:54.480]  going to spend $5 a month on that? But at the meantime, Apple was
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:58.080]  giving away Apple TV Plus subscriptions to anybody who bought like
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:01.360]  anything over a couple hundred bucks from Apple. They weren't really
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:05.120]  trying to get people to pay for it for the first year or two. And I
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.720]  don't feel like the news media as a whole has ever revisited their
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:14.880]  Apple TV Plus is not going anywhere because they don't have enough
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.800]  original content. Whereas it's a very typical Apple mindset where
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:24.000]  they're, okay, sure, we're not going to spend $69 billion to buy an
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.880]  enormous library of pre-existing content, but we'll build our own.
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:32.320]  And next thing you know, five years have gone by and they've got like
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:38.800]  a hundred original movies and shows. So I remember texting the ATP
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:44.080]  fellows, I don't know, a couple of years ago about this. Apple has a
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:50.560]  lot of money, took a lot of money and they've got taste, right? And if
[02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:54.400]  CBS or anybody wants to compete with the amount of money that Apple's
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.680]  just going to keep spending year after year, they're going to get
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:01.920]  there. And here's the thing, they're not making shit. It's all pretty
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.480]  good. Not always to my taste, but again, I'm like, okay, I see where
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.160]  your money went. Fine.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.400]  The other thing that set off first impressions was the Valley of the App
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:19.680]  Show, whatever that was called, and Carpool Karaoke. And too many
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.160]  people...
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:26.240]  Do you mind if I spoil what your original plan was? Your name is
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:27.520]  original plan wise?
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:30.640]  I don't remember. I guess you can say it. We'll beep it out if I don't
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:38.320]  like it. Are you going to do a show just about dunking on Planet of the
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:38.880]  Apps?
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.680]  Oh, yeah, that was true. That was true.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.640]  I forget what it was called because it had a great name.
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:49.280]  Oh, we did. Yeah, we did. We had an idea. We were together probably in
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:52.320]  Vegas and we're making fun of the Planet of the App Show. And we had
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.240]  the idea that my wife and I would do a podcast every night after an
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:58.640]  episode of the show, dunking on it.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.160]  Yeah, like a just watch, like a recap thing that would just dunk on it.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.920]  And the thing is, it wasn't even good enough to dunk on.
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:09.600]  No, that was why we didn't do it. That was ultimately why we didn't do
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.360]  it. God, that would have been good. I wish it was worse so we could have
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:13.680]  done it.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.280]  It wouldn't have been because you didn't have the material to do it
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:17.600]  with.
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.440]  Or better. I wish it had been slightly... It's like the Alan Key thing
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.560]  that the Macintosh was the first computer good enough to criticize.
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.200]  It wasn't even good enough to criticize. I wish it had been better so
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.480]  that we could have dunked on it.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:33.760]  Yeah, that would have been a good show.
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.160]  Anyway, I think streaming is good. I think Netflix deserves to be on top
[02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:41.360]  and I don't think people should be saying the sky is falling for them.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.480]  Maybe. What do you say? You and I have gone on long enough. I don't think
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:47.760]  we... I don't think we... I've got it on my list of things to talk about
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:50.640]  the Book of Boba Fett. Maybe we should do a Star Wars Spectacular and
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.800]  talk about it once the season's over. All right, guys, it's good to have
[02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:58.480]  you on. So you're on the Biff podcast that's on the Incomparable Network.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:01.200]  Is that the only regular podcast you're on at the moment?
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.160]  I am. Yeah, I used to do a Devo podcast, so it was probably more
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:10.800]  relevant to your fans. And honestly, I think it's a historical document
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.760]  worth checking out. But yeah, if you want to hear me be dumb with John
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:21.520]  Molt. Honestly, wouldn't you like to talk to Molt every week?
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.960]  Oh, I could do. I could talk to Molt any day of the week.
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:32.400]  Right. Yeah. Okay. And my good friend, Donmar, who I feel like I'm
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:37.200]  violently underplaying here, but, you know, in contrast to Molt's.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:44.880]  Yeah. This has been a lot of fun and I swear to God, nobody's going to
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:48.240]  like this episode. This is not going to be fun.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:52.560]  Well, I enjoyed it. Thank you, Guy. I did, too. Love you, man.
