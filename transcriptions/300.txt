[00:00.960 --> 00:06.620]  Screw episode 100 never market episode 200 forget about it
[00:07.680 --> 00:14.800]  Yeah, 400 in the future. We'll see. I don't want to speak to the future 300. Yeah, it's a hollow
[00:14.800 --> 00:16.800]  It's a holiday party
[00:16.840 --> 00:18.840]  You know, we should clear a couple things up
[00:19.200 --> 00:25.960]  You were still in the midst of a holiday party and and I am very disappointed in all of your listeners who think that I was
[00:25.960 --> 00:27.520]  also participating
[00:27.520 --> 00:32.360]  In the holiday party at the same time, which says a lot about I guess how I conduct myself, you know
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.360]  So so four years ago
[00:38.240 --> 00:41.880]  the day after the election you and I recorded an episode and I
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.960]  was I was in the midst of a holiday party and I I
[00:47.600 --> 00:52.400]  Perhaps I did you wrong. I you know, maybe we should straighten this out before we get to current events
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.920]  I perhaps I owe you an apology nothing. You owe me nothing. What had happened was that there had been an election that had not
[01:00.240 --> 01:06.320]  Say the least not turned out the way that we expected and like a lot of people we were a little bit fitful and needed
[01:06.320 --> 01:09.320]  To get some get some ideas and emotions up. I
[01:11.760 --> 01:16.300]  And and we did and the service you'd been up all night
[01:16.300 --> 01:22.300]  Kind of well up up, you know is a is a is a weird word
[01:22.300 --> 01:27.660]  Like I was inclined probably like, oh, I hear arm over the arm of the couch. I
[01:29.180 --> 01:36.140]  Will so so going into this I I and I you know, you and I didn't talk extensively about having a
[01:36.780 --> 01:40.620]  Redux holiday party, but but you know, it was on the table
[01:40.620 --> 01:42.180]  We'd you know, just enough, you know
[01:42.180 --> 01:47.220]  Like you and I get along well enough and we know each other well enough that it's sort of like that
[01:48.340 --> 01:55.820]  That Michelangelo painting where God and Michael or Adam whatever his name is are just just a touch of a finger
[01:55.820 --> 02:00.980]  You know, I mean like the slightest touch. Yeah, just the tip you and I, you know, it's like it was on the table
[02:00.980 --> 02:02.420]  Let's see
[02:02.420 --> 02:07.060]  but as with so many things whether as rational as one likes to think one is I
[02:07.060 --> 02:13.140]  Still have big Ben. I'm sure we'll talk about this. I I have not a lot of my brain has I think been
[02:13.380 --> 02:18.740]  Pathways have been a little bit rewired and I have been superstitious about a lot of things. I
[02:19.540 --> 02:27.060]  Me too, and we didn't even our fingertips touched and we did not even to say need to say that we're being superstitious because a
[02:27.300 --> 02:30.580]  Superstitious person knows not to even mention that they're superstitious
[02:30.580 --> 02:37.860]  All right, and a not superstitious person doesn't even want to admit and that the superstition is creeping up
[02:37.860 --> 02:43.460]  So for example on that front I I have some very negative
[02:45.300 --> 02:48.260]  Associations with mr. Steve Kornacki
[02:50.740 --> 02:57.700]  Steve Steve Kornacki should come with a trigger warning now for those who don't know Steve Kornacki is is the
[02:57.700 --> 03:05.140]  Msnbc personality who's in charge of their this is now I'm not making this up that they're big board big board
[03:05.140 --> 03:07.140]  It's different the magic board
[03:07.300 --> 03:08.820]  right
[03:08.820 --> 03:10.820]  and
[03:10.820 --> 03:17.700]  He is sort of the funnel point between their decision desk
[03:18.100 --> 03:20.100]  Now those are people who are off camera
[03:21.460 --> 03:23.460]  Probably in a basement
[03:23.460 --> 03:29.060]  Well, there's a phrase there's a phrase that we did we don't use in journalism anymore, but let's just call it a wall you get a wall
[03:29.860 --> 03:32.100]  between the advertisers and
[03:32.740 --> 03:36.900]  There's there's walls between advertisers opinion news and in this case
[03:37.060 --> 03:41.060]  There's somebody sitting in some kind of underground bunker probably an assault mine
[03:41.700 --> 03:48.420]  Somewhere in the in the West who will be the team that decides when a call is called, right?
[03:48.420 --> 03:50.420]  Is that kind of the rough idea?
[03:50.420 --> 03:56.180]  All right numbers come in projections get made and Kornacki is the interface
[03:56.580 --> 04:03.860]  To the public of what the network is going to going to say and it's it was Kornacki who was delivering the news
[04:03.860 --> 04:10.660]  Four years ago where I knew and i'm a i'm a junkie on this, you know, I really am. I I really I
[04:11.220 --> 04:13.220]  Get you're watching webcams, right?
[04:13.220 --> 04:15.220]  Yeah, i'm you know, i'm the guy
[04:15.860 --> 04:17.300]  You know like
[04:17.300 --> 04:22.980]  For me on election night. It's sort of like being the baseball fan who's not even really watching the game
[04:22.980 --> 04:24.580]  He's mostly watching, you know
[04:24.580 --> 04:28.180]  You you come in you buy the score book and you take your pen and you're keeping score
[04:28.180 --> 04:33.780]  The score book is more important to me than the game, you know, and i'm i'm watching it and four years ago
[04:33.780 --> 04:37.540]  I just you know, Florida went bad and it was like, ooh
[04:37.700 --> 04:43.140]  And then they started talking about exit polls that were bad and then North Carolina
[04:43.140 --> 04:49.300]  Went bad and then I I just poured myself like a pint glass of vodka and you know lights went out
[04:49.300 --> 04:51.300]  Yeah, and like there was that funnel though
[04:52.180 --> 04:54.180]  You know everything starts out with you know
[04:54.180 --> 04:59.940]  the the world of dreams and somebody just needs to get to 270 and as we've certainly seen over the last three four days you do get
[04:59.940 --> 05:04.100]  To a certain point where and you know, what? Can we stop saying vote?
[05:04.100 --> 05:07.460]  Why don't we say ballots vote is not a plural noun stop doing that
[05:07.460 --> 05:10.740]  But anyway, i'm gonna go find more votes. I'm gonna go find more votes. I'm gonna go find more votes
[05:10.740 --> 05:14.020]  But anyway, I'm gonna go find more votes. I'm gonna go find more votes. I'm gonna go find more votes. I'm gonna go find more votes so
[05:14.020 --> 05:18.820]  There's you we talked about this last time I think but you get to like Michigan and that, you know
[05:18.900 --> 05:23.860]  Big funnel is suddenly getting more and more narrow and so Michigan, I don't know
[05:23.940 --> 05:27.220]  It's not looking very good and you give all down to this county and you remember at one point
[05:27.300 --> 05:30.500]  This is when I felt when I was really just ready to get the pint glass
[05:30.820 --> 05:33.220]  Was when we finally got down to like, well, there's just we think
[05:33.220 --> 05:39.460]  there might be one county with a few like there may be a box of votes
[05:39.460 --> 05:44.700]  somewhere and we were just clinging to hope the entire time as that funnel
[05:44.700 --> 05:49.580]  continued to narrow everywhere and it must be said on top of which you know
[05:49.580 --> 05:54.060]  sure maybe we're idiots but like I the whole thing seemed so implausible for a
[05:54.060 --> 05:57.860]  million reasons including our friend at South by Southwest there were so many
[05:57.860 --> 06:02.060]  reasons to think there are so many reasons to think that everything was
[06:02.060 --> 06:06.980]  gonna be fine and they got narrower and narrower and narrower and then you know
[06:06.980 --> 06:12.260]  like you say cornet keys the the khaki interface he's the one who's gonna bring
[06:12.260 --> 06:19.180]  that to us and yeah so I I had it in mind I and I you know and as you know
[06:19.180 --> 06:23.460]  October was when it got real cuz October you know the whole month of October was
[06:23.460 --> 06:27.820]  hey the election is coming you know this is when it went from who I can't wait to
[06:27.820 --> 06:33.220]  try to vote this guy out to all right here we are and it got real up and down
[06:33.220 --> 06:39.900]  it's all along the way and a certain letter was all right posted I you don't
[06:39.900 --> 06:43.140]  have to make a reservation you don't have to call up and get a ballroom you
[06:43.140 --> 06:46.780]  know you're not you're not reserving anything I'm just picking which channel
[06:46.780 --> 06:51.260]  I'm gonna put on TV sure but I started thinking what am I gonna do am I gonna
[06:51.260 --> 06:56.260]  am I gonna do cornet key or more you know MSNBC like a big boy or am I gonna
[06:56.260 --> 07:01.740]  go somewhere else because I got bad associations and I I I'll tell you like
[07:01.740 --> 07:06.620]  2018 with the midterm election I didn't watch MSNBC and it was for that reason I
[07:06.620 --> 07:10.980]  just had I had a bad taste and not that I hold it against him personally it's
[07:10.980 --> 07:15.540]  it's a bad taste my wife my beloved wife when she was there I believe around six
[07:15.540 --> 07:22.420]  or seven years old had a spaghetti dinner and and got a little bit touch of
[07:22.420 --> 07:25.740]  the food poisoning perhaps you know it happens you know you're six you know you
[07:25.740 --> 07:31.060]  get sick filthy filthy fingers yeah it hasn't had a taste for spaghetti with
[07:31.060 --> 07:36.740]  red sauce over is that a fact very deeply she's very intelligent she's
[07:36.740 --> 07:40.980]  she's been to law school but she does she feels things very deeply including
[07:40.980 --> 07:45.820]  one must imagine your feelings about spaghetti yeah yeah yeah I mean now you
[07:45.820 --> 07:49.580]  can tell what time John I mean I had my friends and I made a drink of we had a
[07:49.580 --> 07:54.940]  handle of Jack Daniels and a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew and and that was
[07:54.940 --> 07:58.260]  the thing that we made into drinks and drank and I could not even I could not
[07:58.260 --> 08:03.420]  see a label I could not smell the smell I could not for years and years and
[08:03.420 --> 08:08.060]  years this is basic human psychology this thing made me very sad I don't want
[08:08.060 --> 08:12.940]  to feel that feeling again and I was it now was it the Mountain Dew that that or
[08:12.940 --> 08:18.020]  the Jack Daniels that kills you but it's also I mean it's the Mountain Dew it was
[08:18.020 --> 08:22.740]  Mountain Dew you blame them you blame the Dew yeah huh well I'm not saying
[08:22.740 --> 08:25.620]  that that's what made you sick I'm saying though that you couldn't go so
[08:25.620 --> 08:28.500]  for example you go to a movie theater you can order a Mountain Dew at the
[08:28.500 --> 08:33.060]  movie theater you cannot order at a 64 ounce some relationships are so toxic
[08:33.060 --> 08:36.860]  it's not that any wolf shirt both people are assholes but it's when you get to to
[08:36.860 --> 08:40.380]  differently polarized assholes that come together you know it's they call it
[08:40.380 --> 08:44.260]  synergy like 2 plus 2 equals 35 kind of situation you don't you don't want to
[08:44.260 --> 08:48.940]  miss those yeah yeah you know you eat a plate of spaghetti you get you get a
[08:48.940 --> 08:52.140]  little ill afterwards you feel bad in your stomach maybe for the rest of your
[08:52.140 --> 08:54.780]  life you never have a taste for spaghetti with red sauce now she'll eat
[08:54.780 --> 08:59.500]  spaghetti with like a garlic sauce you know what you have an alfredo or like
[08:59.500 --> 09:04.380]  sure she loves an alfredo sure love saying okay that you know I do I get it
[09:04.380 --> 09:09.900]  yeah and she'll eat and she'll eat red sauce on say any you know rigatoni or
[09:09.900 --> 09:14.380]  you know what have you you know anything except the specific you know because you
[09:14.380 --> 09:19.500]  have that association that was Steve Kornacki for me but I this year I
[09:19.500 --> 09:22.580]  thought you know what I'm putting on the big boy pants no superstition let's go
[09:22.580 --> 09:26.220]  with it let's yeah let's go back you know it was you know you got it you got
[09:26.220 --> 09:34.940]  a you got a face fax I watched the MSNBC I believe I watched for 72 hours um yeah
[09:34.940 --> 09:38.540]  yeah I mean like but it's you know there's the not not to beat this to
[09:38.540 --> 09:42.220]  death but I've heard a lot of people talk about this which was and then you
[09:42.220 --> 09:47.100]  know something I put in our notes here to talk about is this ongoing equally
[09:47.100 --> 09:52.580]  unpleasant cocktail of anhedonia and madness that so many of us have felt so
[09:52.580 --> 09:59.620]  like that night in 2016 I it was so difficult to there was a kind of
[09:59.620 --> 10:02.740]  cognitive dissonance or like certainly at least like an emotional kind of
[10:02.740 --> 10:06.780]  dissonance where you're saying how is this happening and by the time on this
[10:06.780 --> 10:11.380]  recent Tuesday night as we record this is Friday November 6th in the afternoon
[10:11.380 --> 10:18.300]  John's time and but there was that sense of like oh man like you know I talked
[10:18.300 --> 10:21.180]  about with my kid I said you know here's the thing about Florida there's a lot
[10:21.180 --> 10:25.140]  about Florida that's special believe me I grew up there it's America's Wang but
[10:25.140 --> 10:27.620]  there are certain things that are special about Florida in an election
[10:27.620 --> 10:31.820]  including that they have the early votes they count the early votes early there's
[10:31.820 --> 10:35.100]  all kinds of things and basically what it came down to was in one estimation I
[10:35.100 --> 10:41.340]  read that basically Trump had to get Florida to win plus or minus and that by
[10:41.340 --> 10:45.780]  would be nice to get Florida to win but to take it even further down the the as
[10:45.780 --> 10:48.500]  the you know there's all the pathways there's some wonderful graphics for this
[10:48.500 --> 10:51.660]  like there's an interactive graphic on once a New York Times where you can like
[10:51.660 --> 10:54.540]  see what different scenarios indicate but what I said to her was you know
[10:54.540 --> 10:58.420]  here's the thing if we might know by seven o'clock if this thing's in the bag
[10:58.420 --> 11:05.140]  where a situation in which they're able to say okay Florida is very much too
[11:05.140 --> 11:09.180]  close to call too early to call but boy if Florida looks good for Biden it's not
[11:09.180 --> 11:13.380]  game over but you know it's basically if Trump's playing Gallagher he's on his
[11:13.380 --> 11:20.180]  last dude and so basically if Biden wins Florida he's something like 90% likely
[11:20.180 --> 11:24.740]  to win not also because Florida is a bellwether for places like you know
[11:24.740 --> 11:30.500]  other southern states if Trump wins Florida it's only a one in three for the
[11:30.500 --> 11:34.460]  whole Shigella but that's still it's a big difference it's what there's a big
[11:34.460 --> 11:39.060]  difference between no and everything but now and so that's we're hanging our
[11:39.060 --> 11:43.620]  hopes and guess what Kornacki's up there he's looking real good and it becomes
[11:43.620 --> 11:46.980]  clear it's not gonna be Florida and what does that do John now I'm bringing up
[11:46.980 --> 11:52.200]  biscuity all over the place yeah yep again again really how is this even
[11:52.200 --> 11:59.020]  close I feel like I'm taking crazy pills it's there there was the easy way and
[11:59.020 --> 12:04.380]  there was the hard way and the the easy way was Florida goes Biden again not
[12:04.380 --> 12:09.140]  over over but literally almost impossible not just because of Florida's
[12:09.140 --> 12:15.020]  29 electoral votes but because if it's it's like this if then cascading if then
[12:15.020 --> 12:21.420]  statement of public sentiment and that's exactly why I knew to break out the
[12:21.420 --> 12:26.740]  pint glass of vodka so early four years ago was there were a couple of if then
[12:26.740 --> 12:31.140]  statements and I just remember North Carolina being it because North Carolina
[12:31.140 --> 12:33.860]  and again this year it looks like Trump's gonna win North Carolina we've
[12:33.860 --> 12:39.380]  recalibrated our thoughts on North Carolina but Obama had won it twice it
[12:39.380 --> 12:42.940]  was ordered us to still need to learn there's more than one quote-unquote
[12:42.940 --> 12:47.380]  Latino person we know that that's the thing we're gonna need to really sit
[12:47.380 --> 12:53.620]  with right saying saying the Latino vote is a little bit like saying the plaid
[12:53.620 --> 12:59.020]  shirt group right it's like it's not really it's not it's not really super
[12:59.020 --> 13:01.900]  useful in terms of understanding that that group of folks and maybe it's a
[13:01.900 --> 13:05.440]  little bit insulting whether you're Latino or wear a plaid shirt not super
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.500]  useful right and we blew that a little bit and now we'll know that hopefully
[13:09.500 --> 13:13.340]  we'll work on that but yeah that that's when the feelings start welling up and
[13:13.340 --> 13:17.060]  got a little tight and I had a feeling I very rarely have because of all my
[13:17.060 --> 13:21.620]  various disabilities as a person as a human I rarely feel like oh my gosh I
[13:21.620 --> 13:26.260]  wonder if I'm having a cardiac event and I've gotten several bloops on my watch
[13:26.260 --> 13:31.180]  to let me know that my heart was was a little bit accelerated but you know did
[13:31.180 --> 13:34.980]  you do you agree though I mean that's there is that feeling of like I cannot
[13:34.980 --> 13:38.820]  handle a here we go again situation I've been dreading this for four years my
[13:38.820 --> 13:44.140]  combination of anhedonia and madness is really dragging me down emotionally I
[13:44.140 --> 13:48.620]  would love tonight to be the phrase that I wrote down here is that we could have
[13:48.620 --> 13:53.900]  really used a clean break clean break decisive victory no problems with being
[13:53.900 --> 13:58.900]  able to say these eight votes in this box shouldn't be counted if it had been
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.980]  a decisive victory we gave ourselves it's like the sand said less that's the
[14:02.980 --> 14:08.020]  hope that kills you that's what we were hoping for and when it didn't happen you
[14:08.020 --> 14:14.820]  can't help but be a little bummed I I've made some personal changes this year and
[14:14.820 --> 14:20.340]  one of them is I I've gotten diligent about my email and I've stuck with it
[14:20.340 --> 14:24.260]  all year and this is a big change you know from someone who's finished most
[14:24.260 --> 14:31.820]  years in the whole 10 15 20 thousand unread emails one of them is I figured
[14:31.820 --> 14:37.180]  out I'd I have to and I'll name the company I'll name them it's it's a
[14:37.180 --> 14:42.260]  company called Google they run it they run a service called gmail that I back
[14:42.260 --> 14:48.020]  several of my email accounts from and I thinking I need to move but anyway
[14:48.020 --> 14:53.940]  that's neither here nor there but the fact is every day I have about a grand
[14:53.940 --> 15:00.420]  total of very consistent which is nice about 50 to 70 spams a day in these are
[15:00.420 --> 15:06.740]  in this band will you be claiming your Bitcoin well I know but I don't know for
[15:06.740 --> 15:11.740]  them to crack that a lot of those and the word Bitcoin and the obviously not
[15:11.740 --> 15:15.660]  correct version of my name that's used in this particular email address that's
[15:15.660 --> 15:20.660]  also that they can't correct no matter what I do no matter who I add to my
[15:20.660 --> 15:25.780]  address book and what I flag is not spam there's at least two or three non spams
[15:25.780 --> 15:31.540]  in my spam every day so I go through every day it actually feels very 19 like
[15:31.540 --> 15:36.340]  99 maybe 2000 yeah that feels very 2002 back when you really you would get like
[15:36.340 --> 15:40.160]  in some like fast mail or spam said if you get a Bayesian thing going but you
[15:40.160 --> 15:45.300]  still have to like check in to make sure you know yeah all I'm saying is it where
[15:45.300 --> 15:50.580]  I'm going with this is that I eyeball all of my spam about 50 to 60 spams a
[15:50.580 --> 15:53.980]  day it's just part of my habit I have it it's it I've ingrained it's like making
[15:53.980 --> 15:58.700]  coffee right it's I'm okay it's good but I like fun I feel good about finding the
[15:58.700 --> 16:03.780]  ones that are in there and oh you're like Oscar Schindler but for mail that's
[16:03.780 --> 16:09.900]  cool so sometimes I find once it's a little freaky and election day Tuesday
[16:09.900 --> 16:15.300]  I'm going through my spam you know and it I don't know about you but during the
[16:15.300 --> 16:23.940]  day on Tuesday I found a lot of busy work I'll put a little bit of sauce on
[16:23.940 --> 16:27.980]  that taco I found myself various times through this past week going you're
[16:27.980 --> 16:34.180]  sending an email to me right now really you know I I'm here I make a lot of
[16:34.180 --> 16:40.260]  playlists and I I rearranged the dorm fridge here at my office I find a lot of

[16:48.660 --> 16:52.420]  became we're sort of the Zen garden yeah yeah but here's the thing here's where
[16:52.420 --> 16:55.900]  I'm going yeah one every once in a while you if you look at your spam every day
[16:55.900 --> 16:59.500]  every once in a while you get one with the subject that it makes you double
[16:59.500 --> 17:05.540]  take right because it's not about boner pills or oh they send you a lot yeah I
[17:05.540 --> 17:08.300]  don't know if you've looked at your spam lady but boy oh boy you get a lot of

[17:20.100 --> 17:25.940]  that yeah well and one just jumps out of me the subject was will you have a heart
[17:25.940 --> 17:35.040]  attack all caps tonight I thought to myself what do you know this could be a
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.660]  Blumhouse film that sounds like the beginning of a very good low-budget
[17:38.660 --> 17:43.460]  horror film I I even clicked on that one just to double check that it wasn't some
[17:43.460 --> 17:48.540]  kind of you know good man from the future who who might know something I
[17:48.540 --> 17:57.980]  didn't know yeah exactly read this spam email oh god we've got to write this
[17:57.980 --> 18:03.940]  extra but here's what I got looks like yesterday and this is the it's from it's
[18:03.940 --> 18:08.020]  from it's from the user name is dribbling of urine it's dribbling of
[18:08.020 --> 18:13.380]  urine at option point dot buzz and what they're saying here is press this anus
[18:13.380 --> 18:17.900]  pressure point to shrink inflamed prostate overnight yeah that's a good
[18:17.900 --> 18:21.340]  one the truth is out they say for 5,000 years the Chinese all this a little
[18:21.340 --> 18:27.100]  racist have kept this acupressure trick locked and sealed but you see the best
[18:27.100 --> 18:31.100]  stuff did and that gave it did that okay now did that make you superstitious did
[18:31.100 --> 18:35.540]  you think okay is this future me is this like me with a strap-on beard from a
[18:35.540 --> 18:38.740]  different time but I can't let myself know that because I know I wouldn't
[18:38.740 --> 18:41.540]  believe it you know I'm saying you played that game you have you know
[18:41.540 --> 18:44.600]  protocol with your wife about how to know whether you've been face-offed you
[18:44.600 --> 18:48.500]  must have thought about you must have thought about at their various times how
[18:48.500 --> 18:53.620]  would I convince myself from a different time that it's me and I yeah I think I
[18:53.620 --> 18:57.020]  don't think you were at liberty to tell people that Merlin I think you just
[18:57.020 --> 19:02.100]  broke some of our upset gun oh no did I break face-off protocol well you know
[19:02.100 --> 19:05.700]  it's all right I feel like our protocol okay well maybe I maybe ask some
[19:05.700 --> 19:09.700]  questions for you right now because I have some concerns yeah how much of the
[19:09.700 --> 19:17.300]  day how much of the day could you eat a peach don't ever think it anyway I
[19:17.300 --> 19:24.980]  watched the kornacki I watched MSNBC I got I got the bad feeling so my friend
[19:24.980 --> 19:30.740]  Ben Thompson and I do a show the dithering we do it three nights a week
[19:30.740 --> 19:37.860]  or you know it's we do it at 10 p.m. Sunday Tuesday Thursday my time that's
[19:37.860 --> 19:42.980]  in the morning Ben's time over there in Taiwan and then the show comes out for
[19:42.980 --> 19:46.660]  listeners of the show on Monday Wednesday Friday mornings it's been
[19:46.660 --> 19:51.580]  great success we have a lot of fun with it 15 minutes an episode but it occurred
[19:51.580 --> 19:54.980]  to me last week hadn't really thought about it you know this is our first year
[19:54.980 --> 19:59.140]  we started this thing I think back around a April or so you know and then
[19:59.140 --> 20:02.940]  you you you go through your year your year has patterns it just never really
[20:02.940 --> 20:06.420]  occurred to me you know you think about things like Christmas and other major
[20:06.420 --> 20:10.060]  holidays you know like Thanksgiving we're not gonna record Thanksgiving
[20:10.060 --> 20:12.580]  night you know we're not going anywhere on Thanksgiving I don't know if you
[20:12.580 --> 20:18.300]  heard there's a pandemic hmm but election night what am I what are we
[20:18.300 --> 20:21.620]  gonna do how do we record and we thought I said that I said Ben what do we do
[20:21.620 --> 20:25.540]  what I mean there's a very good chance that come 10 p.m. Eastern Time we all
[20:25.540 --> 20:31.460]  have literally have no idea what who's the winner how do you do a show if you
[20:31.460 --> 20:35.180]  don't know the winner and he's like don't worry about it this and that that
[20:35.180 --> 20:39.060]  seems to me like a John Gruber thing to say it felt like Ben was stepping into
[20:39.060 --> 20:43.260]  the role that I would usually play yeah which is don't worry about it it'll all
[20:43.260 --> 20:48.780]  work out yeah so we record right on time Benson and I at 10 o'clock at night I'm
[20:48.780 --> 20:53.860]  starting to feel bad and and this way I was at a low point and Ben was like
[20:53.860 --> 20:57.380]  don't worry about it it'll be good we got so we have time for you seven for me
[20:57.380 --> 21:02.240]  that's relatively early in the world unless we got the Florida dunk which we
[21:02.240 --> 21:06.660]  didn't so Florida was Florida had already gone south right bad real bad
[21:06.660 --> 21:13.180]  and and maybe the only saving grace was that it was this whole big demographic
[21:13.180 --> 21:19.580]  shift in South Florida from Cuban Americans and other Latin Americans
[21:19.580 --> 21:26.420]  Latinos when you're waiting for the pool or the polling locations to close in the
[21:26.420 --> 21:31.980]  central time zone part of the panhandle that's not going to be your richest
[21:31.980 --> 21:38.060]  source of big wins for mr. Biden well we as somebody who's from who's lived in
[21:38.060 --> 21:42.380]  Tallahassee I'm just yeah I've been to what color County and I have a pretty
[21:42.380 --> 21:49.140]  good don't you love do you love I love as a citizen of this great nation I love
[21:49.140 --> 21:54.220]  how every four years you learn some great County names I first of all I
[21:54.220 --> 21:58.460]  know I didn't never think about the cab County Georgia I would call it to Kalb
[21:58.460 --> 22:02.300]  County but now of course I know that because you got John King up there and
[22:02.300 --> 22:06.100]  John King you know I don't know if I he's real good at what he does but boy
[22:06.100 --> 22:10.060]  he just seems he seems a little bit annoyed all the time he's gonna go over
[22:10.060 --> 22:13.460]  it again and again oh yeah well I love seeing all this blue on there but that's
[22:13.460 --> 22:17.180]  okay all right all right pump the brakes John I'm gonna tell you who John I
[22:17.180 --> 22:20.360]  learned so much about geography I'm no corn ackee corn ackee man as we
[22:20.360 --> 22:23.500]  stipulated four years ago the man the man's monster
[22:23.500 --> 22:30.460]  arithmetic arithmetic alone let alone geography like I mean I don't know how
[22:30.460 --> 22:37.380]  he does it and stays so cheerful John King is the CNN corn ackee yep now
[22:37.380 --> 22:45.180]  here's the difference John King is on TV all the time the other 364 days a year
[22:45.180 --> 22:48.780]  yeah it's the other White House White House reporter correspondent I feel it
[22:48.780 --> 22:52.220]  yes Christ was a corporal maybe the Clinton corn ackee I don't know what the
[22:52.220 --> 22:56.020]  hell corn ackee does between elections I'm sure whatever he does he earns every
[22:56.020 --> 23:00.300]  penny of it but corn ackee this is this is what corn ackee was born to do he's
[23:00.300 --> 23:04.340]  he's deployed he's best deployed sometimes he sits in like when that one
[23:04.340 --> 23:09.340]  what's his name the dingaling guy I got fired from MSNBC corn ackee did a great
[23:09.340 --> 23:13.900]  job sitting in for him for a while but no I think they mostly keep him in some
[23:13.900 --> 23:17.380]  kind of like what we do in shadows coffin mothballs they but they deploy
[23:17.380 --> 23:21.300]  corn ackee very they unleash the corn ackee they've got to deploy him very
[23:21.300 --> 23:27.260]  carefully you know he's like a gremlin you know who is that ding-a-ling got
[23:27.260 --> 23:32.820]  fired I was uh was that the Chris Chris Chris Matthews yeah Chris Matthews
[23:32.820 --> 23:38.180]  that's right like has always had outstanding Fred Willard energy he's
[23:38.180 --> 23:42.620]  always very yeah so I always wanted to love Chris Matthews because Chris
[23:42.620 --> 23:47.060]  Matthews is from the Philadelphia area and he talks like a Philly guy and he
[23:47.060 --> 23:51.100]  knows the Philly local poly he would have been so great if he hadn't been
[23:51.100 --> 23:57.100]  such a ding-a-ling yeah I know this would have been his year so anybody who
[23:57.100 --> 24:01.380]  wants to keep dunking on Chris Chris Matthews just know that Chris Matthews
[24:01.380 --> 24:06.340]  knows yeah that this year when it all came down to the Philadelphia area the
[24:06.340 --> 24:10.620]  city and the region this was his year this was the year Chris Matthews was
[24:10.620 --> 24:14.960]  meant to be on TV and he ding-a-ling did up real good you don't know Matthew's
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.020]  too hard he's gonna he's gonna throw a D battery at you that's where he's from
[24:19.020 --> 24:27.220]  take that Pete Rose Wow Wow John King from CNN I think he's alright at his
[24:27.220 --> 24:31.200]  day-to-day job not a big CNN guy me I'm not really a cable news guy to tell you
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.340]  the truth but that's like saying you're not really a doctor's office guy but
[24:36.340 --> 24:41.640]  when Johnny wants to be there but like you say you know what and you know what
[24:41.640 --> 24:45.580]  that's not bad because the and then you know you know our good friend Mike
[24:45.580 --> 24:51.500]  Davidson he's got a luxurious beard by the way really right up there with
[24:51.500 --> 24:56.020]  Letterman Letterman and Mike Davidson neck-and-neck for Trump era beard growth
[24:56.020 --> 24:59.760]  but Mike Davidson had a quote the other night I don't might have been Wednesday
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.020]  night you know literally 24 hours you know into this and he was at one point
[25:04.020 --> 25:10.740]  at NBC right yeah he was at a start he's news guy he's startup guy and I know a
[25:10.740 --> 25:14.740]  bunch of people from when he was at NBC and now like for example Tiff is now
[25:14.740 --> 25:18.580]  working at the New York Times doing graphic stuff but that's a fun group to
[25:18.580 --> 25:23.700]  have drinks with the the the tweet was basically I'll paraphrase because I'm
[25:23.700 --> 25:26.980]  not gonna bother to look it up but the tweet was basically hey you know how
[25:26.980 --> 25:30.460]  you're watching cable news non-stop right now just know that millions of your
[25:30.460 --> 25:35.420]  fellow Americans watch this all day every day I've been I've been through
[25:35.420 --> 25:42.220]  it I had to really make at the strong advising of my shrink I really had to
[25:42.220 --> 25:46.820]  cut back because I was all the way in on the Rachel Maddow like we had to throw
[25:46.820 --> 25:50.380]  out the script tonight oh what's going on with rush the craziest and like I was
[25:50.380 --> 25:54.700]  I was there because because why because what we know about cognitive biases
[25:54.700 --> 25:58.200]  which is that in order for me to not feel like I'm taking crazy pills I have
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.500]  to hear somebody say out loud the things that are in my brain is that wholesome
[26:02.500 --> 26:08.460]  in the end it was not wholesome and but as I told you this morning one reason
[26:08.460 --> 26:11.520]  you need to catch me up in a minute on what's happening right now because I'm
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.940]  as I talked to my shrink this morning he's like you still staying off social
[26:13.940 --> 26:20.380]  media I'm like um I could say yes but you know I think the evidence is out
[26:20.380 --> 26:27.360]  there that I'm not doing the best job at that right now um but so oh no you're
[26:27.360 --> 26:30.420]  after you're absolutely right and this is this could get us into a million
[26:30.420 --> 26:36.140]  different things about what we each feed our brain with all day long and like it
[26:36.140 --> 26:40.820]  when we sit here going I I still can't believe like I said to my family over
[26:40.820 --> 26:44.540]  and over there's two things I say over and over I can't believe I said I say I
[26:44.540 --> 26:48.140]  just want him to be sad I don't want to go to jail everybody wants to go to jail
[26:48.140 --> 26:51.060]  I just want Donald Trump to be sad that's all I care about I wouldn't I
[26:51.060 --> 26:57.140]  want him to be sad and I want to I want to not feel crazy about what I think I
[26:57.140 --> 27:01.860]  understand in the world and of course the irony is that over on the other side
[27:01.860 --> 27:06.620]  all of the other sides everybody else is also thinking the same thing those
[27:06.620 --> 27:11.940]  people outside praying and bowing in red hats in front of the vote count last
[27:11.940 --> 27:15.300]  night did you see that in the video that yeah I did that down in Arizona right
[27:15.300 --> 27:19.820]  holy mackerel if that's not a cult it'll do for now but they're thinking the same
[27:19.820 --> 27:23.540]  thing it's just about a different thing from a different POV we're all wondering
[27:23.540 --> 27:27.740]  why everybody we feel crazy because everybody else seems crazy it's never
[27:27.740 --> 27:31.340]  been clearer that that's not going away anytime soon all right let's take a
[27:31.340 --> 27:37.020]  break oh yeah and uh let me thank our first sponsor it's our good friends at
[27:37.020 --> 27:44.220]  Mac Weldon is this a bit this is not a bit this is legit this is on the
[27:44.220 --> 27:49.220]  schedule this this is out of my doing look Mac it's a premium alright it's a
[27:49.220 --> 27:52.740]  premium men's essential brand uh-huh they believe in smart designs quality
[27:52.740 --> 27:57.660]  fabrics they sell things underwear socks hoodies underwear polos I think I said
[27:57.660 --> 28:01.020]  underwear twice but that's what they started with yeah active shorts I don't
[28:01.020 --> 28:03.660]  even know what the difference between the inactive shorts and active shorts
[28:03.660 --> 28:08.940]  are but they say it's gonna be the best underwear socks and hoodies and more I
[28:08.940 --> 28:13.740]  would I would love a pass at that edit because I think it elides the fact that
[28:13.740 --> 28:17.540]  their stuff is actually insanely great I am wearing three articles of Mac
[28:17.540 --> 28:24.300]  Weldon right now I love it I love huge I love their undershirts the clothes
[28:24.300 --> 28:27.740]  you've got the stuff you've got the stuff you don't need to say and more
[28:27.740 --> 28:30.820]  they got the underpants you want to get the shirts you want why are we still
[28:30.820 --> 28:36.540]  talking about this you ever make a common-sense realization later in life
[28:36.540 --> 28:40.820]  and it's the dumbest thing but you realize that you'll never get those
[28:40.820 --> 28:46.740]  decades back mm-hmm for me is the idea of the v-neck undershirt interesting
[28:46.740 --> 28:51.980]  because do you wear a necktie most of the time you go out let's say you and
[28:51.980 --> 28:57.460]  lady or in a family maybe you're going out to a nicer dinner you know hit on
[28:57.460 --> 29:06.780]  cable news or in front of a flag for a Twitter icon I'm sure my feet don't fit
[29:06.780 --> 29:12.140]  into shoes anymore a lot has happened collared shirt top button undone yeah
[29:12.140 --> 29:16.420]  that's me I'm not putting that I'm not buttoning that top but what do you put
[29:16.420 --> 29:20.660]  underneath you put a regular t-shirt on you got the t-shirt sticking up over the
[29:20.660 --> 29:24.980]  shirt you put a v-neck t-shirt on that's what the v-neck is for I don't know I
[29:24.980 --> 29:30.300]  wait a minute that's what the v-neck is for yeah the v-neck is so that you can
[29:30.300 --> 29:34.340]  wear a collared shirt yeah undo the top button like a normal human being who's
[29:34.340 --> 29:37.780]  not a poindexter and you don't see an undershirt underneath so you're telling
[29:37.780 --> 29:42.940]  me I wear one of my normal crew tech eight crew neck 18-hour tees that I get
[29:42.940 --> 29:46.700]  from Mac weldon I wear that with a crew neck I'm looking like stork from animal
[29:46.700 --> 29:52.300]  house you're telling you all right you're sweet I I get a v-neck and now I
[29:52.300 --> 29:55.740]  can have that top button open I leave that open for Elijah you look like look
[29:55.740 --> 29:59.100]  good is what you're telling me you look like a cool guy who doesn't even need an
[29:59.100 --> 30:04.740]  undershirt as a v-neck guy and now I wonder yeah because nobody see I wear
[30:04.740 --> 30:09.060]  the v-neck undershirts uh-huh when you're never gonna see it it's cuz I got
[30:09.060 --> 30:13.420]  it it's a literal undershirt anyway okay they've got those I swear by them they
[30:13.420 --> 30:18.100]  are fantastic also swear to God the v-neck I've been wearing these v-neck
[30:18.100 --> 30:20.980]  undershirts from them for years since you've been hearing me talk about Mac
[30:20.980 --> 30:24.980]  welding they all look brand-new I don't know how that's possible because in
[30:24.980 --> 30:27.700]  theory the reason I'm wearing an undershirt is I tend to destroy them
[30:27.700 --> 30:32.020]  well yeah you get those yellow pits but but the other thing we learned about you
[30:32.020 --> 30:35.580]  know from from Chris Anderson you get what's called the long tail I love the
[30:35.580 --> 30:39.700]  ability to tuck in that shirt and have it stay tuck it's not cute doesn't need
[30:39.700 --> 30:43.620]  to be its own whole brand no offense in this case you buy a t-shirt like a
[30:43.620 --> 30:48.940]  gentleman you put it on you tuck it in it's not going anywhere V or crew no
[30:48.940 --> 30:53.460]  yeah you get your press anyway I but I blew decades in my life thinking I was
[30:53.460 --> 30:57.220]  not a crew John John there's things we know and there's things that we know no
[30:57.220 --> 31:02.060]  it's like when people say to you like oh yeah when your wife bugs you about you
[31:02.060 --> 31:05.820]  know replacing the timing belt because it'd be real expensive if it breaks you
[31:05.820 --> 31:09.540]  know that's true but it isn't so it breaks you go you know no that's true
[31:09.540 --> 31:15.220]  and to me that sounds like your v-neck revelation yeah just great stuff they've
[31:15.220 --> 31:19.140]  got advanced technology fabrics I don't know what anything about fabric
[31:19.140 --> 31:24.580]  technology but they you know the air knit X dry near warm knit it's silver oh
[31:24.580 --> 31:27.880]  the silver stuff that's our friend Marco loves it because he can get sweaty as
[31:27.880 --> 31:30.700]  hell it doesn't make you stink it's good stuff they're not they're not I'm
[31:30.700 --> 31:33.940]  wearing that I think it's called the war I'm wearing the kind of I don't say
[31:33.940 --> 31:37.140]  waffle knit I don't know if that's a brand name I'm wearing their um their
[31:37.140 --> 31:42.500]  their black waffle knit shirt right now over a daring fireball shirt because I'm
[31:42.500 --> 31:45.860]  that guy but I also have some other items of Mack Weldon around right now
[31:45.860 --> 31:49.260]  also I just got I forget what did I I don't have it handy but I got there

[34:21.020 --> 34:24.660]  these slippers are we blew it cuz we talked about it on an episode of your
[34:24.660 --> 34:28.980]  podcast the talk show and then and then what happened John they sold out and we
[34:28.980 --> 34:33.900]  couldn't get them and I didn't have much years at this point I didn't have a
[34:33.900 --> 34:39.740]  spare pair and guess what happened in 2020 I never needed anything but
[34:39.740 --> 34:45.460]  slippers I wore the damn things out I haven't worn anything all year except
[34:45.460 --> 34:52.220]  for Mack Weldon slippers and when it got warm enough some flip-flops and and now
[34:52.220 --> 34:57.300]  I'm back to the slippers they're worn out but I've been I they came back into
[34:57.300 --> 35:03.140]  stock the man we had it we had an exchange because I received a forgive
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.300]  me I don't know the person I forget who said this but somebody on Twitter said
[35:05.300 --> 35:10.780]  hey FYI the slippers are back in stock and I immediately I ran my daughter over
[35:10.780 --> 35:14.620]  and I ran straight to the computer to text you and say John it's go time turn
[35:14.620 --> 35:18.300]  your key sir they're back in stock they're back in stock and then what did
[35:18.300 --> 35:25.620]  you see you said you just I ordered I've already gotten two pairs now I opened
[35:25.620 --> 35:33.660]  mine on the air yeah well you know and this is eventually coming I opened them
[35:33.660 --> 35:39.060]  just to examine them just to make sure it was all right here I got I got a
[35:39.060 --> 35:44.580]  utility knife cutting open you know they say you can pull on the ripcord I don't
[35:44.580 --> 35:48.340]  like that I don't like that it feels sloppy to me oh look at these I tried a
[35:48.340 --> 35:52.860]  different color this time I think these are called charcoal I got oh look at
[35:52.860 --> 35:57.540]  that they're in a bag in a bag I love a bag and oh look at that bag and then I
[35:57.540 --> 36:00.780]  got them here you could take that bag you can put that bag right in the
[36:00.780 --> 36:03.980]  suitcase you know what I mean you know if you if you don't like the bag you
[36:03.980 --> 36:10.300]  keep it and they oh anyway I'm doing it right now right now as we speak on the
[36:10.300 --> 36:15.900]  air I've just taken off my old my old slippers I've got my brand new ones
[36:15.900 --> 36:19.820]  mint John this feels important hmm all right here they go now here's the thing
[36:19.820 --> 36:24.580]  here's why I like the Mack Weldon slipper they've got a back a back on
[36:24.580 --> 36:28.940]  the heel now it's not one of those monsters that wears them like a scuff
[36:28.940 --> 36:37.860]  you can do that or you could have some dignity but there I thing is I had to be
[36:37.860 --> 36:43.420]  raped my statue as Donner because she wore them to the park one time look at
[36:43.420 --> 36:47.340]  these oh they're so handsome and John you know what I love these are inside
[36:47.340 --> 36:51.420]  shoes these are inside shoes I only wear these inside that's the thing I might
[36:51.420 --> 36:54.940]  like go to the garage to get toilet paper one of those occasions where my
[36:54.940 --> 37:00.760]  sweatpants fall down around my ankles but but but the Mack Weldon charcoal
[37:00.760 --> 37:05.060]  slipper stand oh these are handsome but they're rugged that's the thing it's not
[37:05.060 --> 37:11.500]  insubstantial they're closer to a shoe in terms of in terms of structure if you
[37:11.500 --> 37:14.940]  needed to run out if somebody if you had them on you're in the house and
[37:14.940 --> 37:19.660]  something happened you need to leave you you could leave and it would be hours
[37:19.660 --> 37:23.700]  like some kind of family emergency type situation oh you're saying Nicolas Cage
[37:23.700 --> 37:29.020]  breaks in you're John whatever I see it would it might be you wouldn't realize
[37:29.020 --> 37:34.260]  until the incident was over holy crap I left with my slippers on as opposed to a
[37:34.260 --> 37:37.780]  typical slipper as soon as you leave the house it'd be like leaving without your
[37:37.780 --> 37:41.260]  pants how great how great is you're running in flip-flops John be honest oh
[37:41.260 --> 37:45.940]  and flip-flops I wouldn't run see that I know it's I'm too old I can't take a
[37:45.940 --> 37:51.580]  fall at this age oh my god we're so brittle hollow bones yeah oh I've got
[37:51.580 --> 37:55.260]  these new slippers on I've been saving them now we never really efficient this
[37:55.260 --> 37:59.460]  is another one of those things where we just sort of the fingertips touched we
[37:59.460 --> 38:04.460]  didn't mean we didn't have a lot of exchanges about this I think I could
[38:04.460 --> 38:08.060]  just know through through intuition it's it's time now what would we have done if
[38:08.060 --> 38:12.500]  the election had turned out bad again would we have would we still have done
[38:12.500 --> 38:23.740]  let's not get over our skis I'm not sure they get you I'm not sure that this had
[38:23.740 --> 38:29.540]  it up in my mind it was like well Biden's seems like he's gonna win we'll
[38:29.540 --> 38:36.260]  do another show and we'll we'll put new slippers on yeah it didn't need to be
[38:36.260 --> 38:41.900]  said it was it was intuitively obvious I can I just tell you now I I'm telling
[38:41.900 --> 38:47.060]  you right now these I don't want to malign them I I'm I love these slippers
[38:47.060 --> 38:49.820]  I want every I want to sell out I want them because I've already stocked up
[38:49.820 --> 38:54.540]  myself so it's a okay go buy as many pairs as you want you're not robbing me
[38:54.540 --> 39:00.260]  of them I'm set for the for the year I don't want to imply that their slippers
[39:00.260 --> 39:05.300]  don't last what I'm saying is I wore the hell out of these slippers in the time
[39:05.300 --> 39:11.620]  since I bought them I mean I'm very sad it's like I say about the Apple TV
[39:11.620 --> 39:15.660]  it works great as long as you never use it if you're using the slippers there
[39:15.660 --> 39:20.100]  will be wearing tear this is not a problem with Mac or Weldon it's it's
[39:20.100 --> 39:22.820]  just that you you love them so much you love them too much it's like a lot like
[39:22.820 --> 39:28.020]  a beloved you know yeah like a stuffy and when I want fresh ones when I'm
[39:28.020 --> 39:31.500]  working when I'm writing when that when the juices are blowing in yeah and the
[39:31.500 --> 39:35.000]  words are coming out mm-hmm I'm on the balls of my I'm I said I don't have a
[39:35.000 --> 39:39.940]  standing desk you know come on come on I'm on the balls of my feet though I
[39:39.940 --> 39:46.100]  think it a heart attack like a man so when you're quote-unquote working yeah
[39:46.100 --> 39:51.020]  but I might be it might look like I'm sitting and I am sitting but I'm on the
[39:51.020 --> 39:55.180]  balls of my feet and my feet are moving you know I'm I'm wearing the slippers
[39:55.180 --> 40:04.380]  down as sitting okay yeah I went out when I'm writing I think I'm not quite
[40:04.380 --> 40:08.660]  sure what I look like but I think what it's really going I might sit there and
[40:08.660 --> 40:12.540]  be in the flow for a full 45 minutes but not if somebody were observing me they
[40:12.540 --> 40:16.580]  would say that's a man who needs to go to the bathroom oh I see that there's a
[40:16.580 --> 40:21.060]  kind of urgency that you haven't a nervous energy yes coming out yes right
[40:21.060 --> 40:24.340]  I know I know I know that I know the feeling I used to write I understand
[40:24.340 --> 40:30.980]  yeah yeah well you know it's hard on slippers it's true it's true yeah well
[40:30.980 --> 40:35.820]  it's occupational hazard you know what his lungs were to my grandfather the
[40:35.820 --> 40:46.020]  coal miner the slippers art to me oh it's okay dad I hope he's looking down
[40:46.020 --> 40:54.580]  and enjoying my sophisticated contextual take on poop and boner jokes yeah I got
[40:54.580 --> 40:56.900]  to get you out of this spot are you gonna are you gonna bring me because we
[40:56.900 --> 41:00.140]  can't go all day today now you're gonna bring me up to speed on where we are now
[41:00.140 --> 41:03.100]  I was talking to my here's where we're about social media bring me up to speed
[41:03.100 --> 41:11.180]  as of 12 12 p.m. Pacific time on Friday November 6 where are we right now you're
[41:11.180 --> 41:15.220]  feeling good but like tell me what's still on the title I'm it's a lock it's
[41:15.220 --> 41:20.340]  done I'm telling you I'm Merlin I'm not trying to spoil anything I'm telling you
[41:20.340 --> 41:25.820]  the networks the networks are only being they're gracious they're more gracious
[41:25.820 --> 41:30.980]  than me it's all over it's over and partly because if you call this too
[41:30.980 --> 41:35.500]  early and then you have to like like that's what Fox is dealing with now is
[41:35.500 --> 41:40.700]  they they got in front of this I guess decision desk HQ is now saying that but
[41:40.700 --> 41:43.500]  this is your bit tell me where tell me where we are now here's where we are
[41:43.500 --> 41:47.980]  here's where we are in none of this is official by the way I mean you could you
[41:47.980 --> 41:51.940]  know what what's the reddest state in in the country I don't know Arkansas maybe
[41:51.940 --> 41:57.320]  Mississippi Alabama one of those states you know where Trump won by 30 or 40
[41:57.320 --> 42:02.000]  percent and and maybe you know you could take some blue states you know you know
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.100]  we know not we know it all along this would come down to a handful of states
[42:06.100 --> 42:11.480]  and be none of those are official right it did New Jersey until the the results
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.820]  are certified but I have found some solace in a BBC graphic that's been
[42:15.820 --> 42:20.420]  going around which was to say for this person to win they will need in this
[42:20.420 --> 42:24.340]  case let's say the the vice president is going to need two of these states or
[42:24.340 --> 42:29.020]  Pennsylvania and for the current president it was that I think he was
[42:29.020 --> 42:33.940]  gonna meet two or three of these states and Pennsylvania right and he's not
[42:33.940 --> 42:37.740]  gonna get Pennsylvania because Pennsylvania you know there are votes
[42:37.740 --> 42:42.700]  still to be counted the official tally already has Joe Biden in the lead and
[42:42.700 --> 42:47.520]  the votes coming in very much and as we learn this from Kornacki the votes
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.980]  coming out they're all in his favor decidedly preposterously so and and
[42:51.980 --> 42:54.860]  there are people who aren't paying attention who think well that sounds
[42:54.860 --> 42:58.900]  crooked and it has nothing to do with crookedness it has to do with the fact
[42:58.900 --> 43:06.340]  that people who listen to the president and did what he told them to do yeah
[43:06.340 --> 43:13.820]  voted in person instead of using mail-in ballots and people who didn't believe a
[43:13.820 --> 43:20.260]  word out of his mouth and were genuinely concerned about this the
[43:20.260 --> 43:25.180]  epidemiological aspects of leaving and going in person and and trusted the
[43:25.180 --> 43:28.460]  state that hey you know we've got mail-in balloting this is the first
[43:28.460 --> 43:32.140]  presidential election where the state of Pennsylvania had it they did this but
[43:32.140 --> 43:36.660]  brand the laws of Pennsylvania they've had a routine before but this is their
[43:36.660 --> 43:43.380]  first absentee but not all right and the laws were such that they can take the
[43:43.380 --> 43:48.580]  envelopes stack them in a box but they can't start couldn't start opening them
[43:48.580 --> 43:52.040]  until mention one more thing here because I think it's I think it's
[43:52.040 --> 43:55.600]  salient to this point and of course as we all know once everything starts
[43:55.600 --> 43:58.740]  seeming related that's when you know that you're crazy why are we so bad at
[43:58.740 --> 44:01.260]  COVID there's a million reasons we're bad at COVID but one of the reasons
[44:01.260 --> 44:05.180]  we're bad at COVID is America hates subtlety and one bit of subtlety that's
[44:05.180 --> 44:08.420]  valuable and I think anybody with any sense goes well there's real different
[44:08.420 --> 44:11.500]  things going on in real different places here's some more subtleties that suck
[44:11.500 --> 44:17.100]  deaths lag cases in a way that can be tracked we know that this particular
[44:17.100 --> 44:20.700]  county with this particular makeup is going to have a very different thing I'm
[44:20.700 --> 44:24.580]  just saying that one reason we suck at COVID is there's not one COVID there's
[44:24.580 --> 44:27.540]  also not one election we like to say there's one election but there's a lot
[44:27.540 --> 44:30.980]  of different elections it's something that is controlled at a state and lower
[44:30.980 --> 44:34.220]  level but on top of all of that and I learned this from our board Kornacki is
[44:34.220 --> 44:39.560]  is that the way the votes are counted the order in which well first of all the
[44:39.560 --> 44:43.780]  kinds of votes obviously you've got some in-person you've got you got the early
[44:43.780 --> 44:47.540]  late in the late earlys you've got the mail-ins you've got the overseas ones
[44:47.540 --> 44:51.020]  but every part of what's making this so frustrating for everybody I think
[44:51.020 --> 44:55.980]  understandably is the order in which those votes are counted differs
[44:55.980 --> 45:01.160]  especially from state to state so if you count in person in in one of the
[45:01.160 --> 45:04.540]  western states a red state early well yeah that's gonna look like a huge what
[45:04.540 --> 45:07.300]  they call I guess a red Mirage it's gonna look like things are great for
[45:07.300 --> 45:10.780]  Trump when the later votes come in that we're mail-in especially in a case like
[45:10.780 --> 45:13.980]  Pennsylvania well guess what that turns around but that's not the same
[45:13.980 --> 45:17.580]  everywhere Georgia there's a different you know I think don't you think that's
[45:17.580 --> 45:20.940]  part of what makes people crazy is not understanding yeah which kinds of votes
[45:20.940 --> 45:27.340]  are being counted tonight yeah yeah absolutely it feels fishy because how
[45:27.340 --> 45:32.900]  could how could our big wet boy lose such a six hundred thousand vote
[45:32.900 --> 45:36.300]  quote-unquote lead and like a lot of people have said you know I'm not in the
[45:36.300 --> 45:39.780]  sports ball like you are but I mean it's a little like saying like you know in
[45:39.780 --> 45:42.420]  the same way that the president likes to say well if you don't count New York
[45:42.420 --> 45:47.140]  covered went great and again it's sort of like saying well you know um the
[45:47.140 --> 45:51.500]  first the first two innings were very positive for our team so why would we
[45:51.500 --> 45:58.660]  finish the game yeah think about it imagine you know you're shooting but
[45:58.660 --> 46:02.580]  you're playing basketball and and the rules are such that your your whole
[46:02.580 --> 46:07.280]  school can play the game but the rules are such that we're gonna play your team
[46:07.280 --> 46:12.340]  only gets to have the ninth graders come out for the first half and then in the
[46:12.340 --> 46:16.140]  second half you can have the seniors and the juniors come out well they're a lot
[46:16.140 --> 46:20.780]  better at basketball Mariano Rivera come out in the first inning but for some
[46:20.780 --> 46:24.660]  reason he's playing shortstop and no one knows why you know it's it there's
[46:24.660 --> 46:27.500]  nothing crooked about it they knew it was going to happen and now that Biden
[46:27.500 --> 46:31.660]  already has the lead as we record it there's no it's no mathematical chance
[46:31.660 --> 46:34.820]  they can call it it's they might have called it while we're while we're
[46:34.820 --> 46:37.380]  recording this show officially as we're recording right now looks like there was
[46:37.380 --> 46:41.940]  a Georgia Secretary of State thing I'm sorry I'm not letting you finish tell me
[46:41.940 --> 46:47.140]  okay you you're confident confident I want to know what is the basis not that
[46:47.140 --> 46:51.980]  I disagree I want to be cheered up here what is the basis for your confidence
[46:51.980 --> 46:57.700]  momentarily for the sake of our of your audience let's set aside yeah the utter
[46:57.700 --> 47:00.980]  conflagration we will be going through for the next six weeks let's set that
[47:00.980 --> 47:05.660]  aside what makes you feel good right now on November 6th so I feel great because
[47:05.660 --> 47:10.860]  the states that have already been called by every single news organization up and
[47:10.860 --> 47:16.220]  down the political spectrum have Biden at over 200 like 253 electoral votes you
[47:16.220 --> 47:22.900]  need 270 to win Pennsylvania is worth 20 he's taken as of this morning the
[47:22.900 --> 47:28.840]  official count has him in the lead most of the votes that are left are mail-in
[47:28.840 --> 47:35.460]  votes that have been running 80 to 20 give or take in Biden's favor in other
[47:35.460 --> 47:39.460]  words four out of every five of these are for Biden one out of every five and
[47:39.460 --> 47:43.020]  this is this is different so there's a part of you that thinks well I mean like
[47:43.020 --> 47:46.300]  I know enough about this kind of stuff to say well just because you got heads
[47:46.300 --> 47:51.940]  four times in a row does not mean that you will get heads 17,000 times in a row
[47:51.940 --> 47:57.540]  but if you're getting says our boy Steve says you're getting 13,000 votes counted
[47:57.540 --> 48:03.420]  roughly per hour and that trend line the percentage of how that's going actually
[48:03.420 --> 48:07.820]  continues to go up along the way that's a pretty good indication and agile right
[48:07.820 --> 48:11.220]  they call this yesterday's weather like if it was 60 degrees yesterday it's not
[48:11.220 --> 48:19.580]  going to be 50,000 degrees tomorrow I agree so anyway Pennsylvania is it it
[48:19.580 --> 48:26.540]  it's it's a lock it is it has if you knew what to look at I thought it's a
[48:26.540 --> 48:31.740]  shoe and I felt I felt like Pennsylvania was a lock for a while
[48:31.740 --> 48:37.540]  Joe Biden is a very superstitious politician he's been in Paul I don't
[48:37.540 --> 48:40.900]  know if you've heard this somebody has told me numerous times he's been in
[48:40.900 --> 48:49.740]  politics for 47 years 47 years I notoriously and and you know I love the
[48:49.740 --> 48:53.060]  state of Delaware Delaware you know you know originally was sort of the
[48:53.060 --> 48:56.500]  southeast extension of Pennsylvania it's a very Pennsylvania southeast
[48:56.500 --> 49:00.300]  Pennsylvania likes there was like it's sort of like a like Shelbyville type
[49:00.300 --> 49:05.380]  situation where people didn't like the the userius credit card laws of yeah I
[49:05.380 --> 49:09.780]  think yes yeah marched out okay yeah something like that but you know
[49:09.780 --> 49:13.860]  culturally extraordinarily similar to southeast Pennsylvania almost identical
[49:13.860 --> 49:19.020]  Joe Biden had been the senator there for a long long long time you know early
[49:19.020 --> 49:23.820]  70s you know never never took it for granted he's one of those guys never
[49:23.820 --> 49:27.580]  ever you know he was a lock he was a lock to get reelected I don't even know
[49:27.580 --> 49:32.100]  if anybody ran against him never ever counted it you know it doing the same
[49:32.100 --> 49:36.580]  they've they've already launched their transition website a superstitious
[49:36.580 --> 49:41.380]  70-some year old man you know right they've already launched every every
[49:41.380 --> 49:45.300]  time we learn something and this is not conspiratorial but every time we learn
[49:45.300 --> 49:49.940]  something based on polling it is reasonable so sorry every time we learn
[49:49.940 --> 49:54.700]  something based on public polling I think it is also reasonable to assume
[49:54.700 --> 49:59.180]  that that public information will also sit alongside what people call
[49:59.180 --> 50:05.200]  internals like internal polls where they might have the ability to do stuff with
[50:05.200 --> 50:07.860]  data that we don't have and have access to things that we don't have now on the
[50:07.860 --> 50:12.540]  one hand you can use that to convince the president that you know that he that
[50:12.540 --> 50:17.500]  he is the I don't know the the Emperor of Japan probably based on certain kinds
[50:17.500 --> 50:22.580]  of polling data but if you have insight that shows a trend line in your internal
[50:22.580 --> 50:26.540]  polls don't you imagine that must that must be something a big part of the last
[50:26.540 --> 50:32.220]  couple days for them it is a very big part of it so that Pennsylvania does it
[50:32.220 --> 50:36.180]  if Pennsylvania is the only of the states that haven't been called quote
[50:36.180 --> 50:40.900]  unquote called Pennsylvania alone put Biden over the top and Pennsylvania is
[50:40.900 --> 50:47.180]  a lock and nobody gets that 20 as we've known all along for the slog anyway once
[50:47.180 --> 50:52.100]  he gets that 20 the the game is over there are not enough points to be put on
[50:52.100 --> 50:57.460]  the board for the president right but in addition to that Nevada now I just
[50:57.460 --> 50:59.860]  learned how to pronounce that this week I thought it was in the bottom should be
[50:59.860 --> 51:06.540]  watching I look yeah yeah so it's Nevada Nevada is closer than polls had
[51:06.540 --> 51:10.460]  suggested but polls polls are just like betting lines and sports you know what I
[51:10.460 --> 51:13.900]  mean they tell you that the Patriots are favored by seven points and the Patriots
[51:13.900 --> 51:20.060]  don't wind up only winning by one maybe they lose the game gamblers you would
[51:20.060 --> 51:23.140]  know this because you're not a gambler but people who gamble have never been
[51:23.140 --> 51:27.200]  been guilty of you know wishful or magical thinking no because there's
[51:27.200 --> 51:32.500]  such there's such raw data machines in terms of exactly yeah but anyway so like
[51:32.500 --> 51:36.860]  predicted org is fun but I would not look to that especially knowing what I
[51:36.860 --> 51:40.460]  know from election profit makers that the maga chuds have gone in there and
[51:40.460 --> 51:45.020]  basically bought they had bought in the previous couple weeks a ton of Trump
[51:45.020 --> 51:49.180]  stuff to try and move the needle on my tail was showing up on predicted can I
[51:49.180 --> 51:53.580]  tell you why it's wrong with predicted and I please yeah I can both tell you
[51:53.580 --> 51:57.140]  what's wrong and do a little bragging I've actually I've actually won several
[51:57.140 --> 52:03.140]  thousand dollars on predicted or this week well because I'm a gambler not that
[52:03.140 --> 52:07.540]  I would gamble but if I were and I would generate gambler you're a gentleman
[52:07.540 --> 52:11.580]  gambler all right the only bet I lost this week it was I did bet on the state
[52:11.580 --> 52:16.300]  of Florida and I lost I lost quite a few hundred did you have trouble getting so
[52:16.300 --> 52:18.820]  I'm saying all this phonetically because everything I know about predicted comes
[52:18.820 --> 52:21.660]  from the wonderful election profit makers podcast which is a podcast
[52:21.660 --> 52:25.740]  started in 2016 where three people who are wonderful go in and try to make
[52:25.740 --> 52:29.420]  money betting on the election but I've heard from them that you know the market
[52:29.420 --> 52:33.020]  gets what do they call it the contract gets saturated or like they won't
[52:33.020 --> 52:35.940]  take any more bets on a certain thing so you have to kind of come in the side
[52:35.940 --> 52:40.340]  door by saying okay will the winner of the North Carolina Democratic primary
[52:40.340 --> 52:44.980]  win or yeah well the big one is like who's gonna what's the margin for
[52:44.980 --> 52:49.300]  electoral votes I mean how many markets are you in well yeah and you can you can
[52:49.300 --> 52:53.620]  get they cap they cap you I don't know why I don't know how much of this law I
[52:53.620 --> 52:58.400]  don't know how much of this is not but they cap your individual at $850 on a
[52:58.400 --> 53:04.780]  market mm-hmm so what you can do is you could bet you can bet 850 on Biden but
[53:04.780 --> 53:09.460]  then you could also bet 850 on which party's nominee will win the
[53:09.460 --> 53:13.700]  presidency Democrat or Republican and they count that as a separate market
[53:13.700 --> 53:18.900]  just in case you know maybe maybe Joe decides that's the thing is if you're
[53:18.900 --> 53:23.460]  like a logician like there's a big difference between you know can this
[53:23.460 --> 53:27.260]  happen will this happen like how do you how do you really close those and then
[53:27.260 --> 53:30.220]  they the way that they do each of these markets is you also didn't have a very
[53:30.220 --> 53:35.620]  specifically worded thing with a date on it correct right but there yes but but
[53:35.620 --> 53:40.220]  basically where those the predicted in particular is very different from a
[53:40.220 --> 53:44.660]  typical sports book is a sports book you can go in on the Super Bowl and if you
[53:44.660 --> 53:48.260]  want to bet a million dollars now you know you're obviously not coming up
[53:48.260 --> 53:51.260]  there with cash they're gonna want to they're gonna want to meet and greet
[53:51.260 --> 53:56.260]  with the manager you know you know you're gonna be might have to sign a
[53:56.260 --> 53:59.700]  couple of papers but they'll take your bet if you would like to bet a million
[53:59.700 --> 54:07.900]  dollars on the Super Bowl oh right you can find somebody that you keep them on
[54:07.900 --> 54:12.220]  you can find a prop Joe who will take your bet on almost anything right so the
[54:12.220 --> 54:18.020]  predicted thing it gets skewed and and went way back and forth and like Tuesday
[54:18.020 --> 54:24.580]  night went way into Trump's favor and somebody who was truly like you know
[54:24.580 --> 54:29.220]  like like our friend from South by really you know it really is just
[54:29.220 --> 54:34.420]  cold-hearted doesn't even care who wins really honest to God doesn't care if
[54:34.420 --> 54:38.080]  it's Trump or Biden but just let's all count for in the model like who wins
[54:38.080 --> 54:42.060]  looking at the numbers all in the model yeah you could make a fortune you could
[54:42.060 --> 54:45.980]  have made a fortune that night because of how the the betting lines went Trump
[54:45.980 --> 54:50.100]  but you actually couldn't in the u.s. markets because you could only bet up to
[54:50.100 --> 54:53.340]  eight hundred and fifty dollars you'd have to like pick individual things like
[54:53.340 --> 54:57.860]  you can put another eight hundred and fifty on Wisconsin I love the I love
[54:57.860 --> 55:02.060]  that the simplicity of the way it's set up which is there's a contract and
[55:02.060 --> 55:06.820]  there's a dollar so basically what you do is you buy or sell at a certain point
[55:06.820 --> 55:10.860]  so it's not as simple as saying I made this bet at this time right part of what
[55:10.860 --> 55:14.620]  makes it so interesting where you can go and scoop up bargains or like you know
[55:14.620 --> 55:18.580]  choose poorly isn't that part of the fun of it is you say well Biden to win is
[55:18.580 --> 55:24.060]  selling at 61 right now maybe I can arbitrage that because I'm pretty sure
[55:24.060 --> 55:29.140]  he's gonna win right isn't that part of the fun is a little bit a little bit it
[55:29.140 --> 55:34.300]  is one of odds in some ways yeah but it's it's not it doesn't mean it would
[55:34.300 --> 55:37.820]  be a lot more fun to me if it was just simple odds because then you don't have
[55:37.820 --> 55:43.300]  to look for the arbitrage but basically anyway you're asking why do I feel good
[55:43.300 --> 55:49.180]  Pennsylvania is in a tank for Biden that puts him over 270 Arizona Arizona is a
[55:49.180 --> 55:55.100]  weird story because it Biden's gonna win but what's weird about Arizona
[55:55.100 --> 55:58.100]  Pennsylvania in a lot of ways though because of the way they're counting and
[55:58.100 --> 56:01.820]  the fact that like what started as a Biden lead has there's been attrition
[56:01.820 --> 56:05.380]  with that in the same way that Trump's lead has had attrition in Pennsylvania
[56:05.380 --> 56:10.340]  it sounds like what happened in our and again this will all get clarified in
[56:10.340 --> 56:15.340]  about two weeks and we'll just know but it sounds like Arizona and Nevada which
[56:15.340 --> 56:19.420]  again I can't get used to saying it that way but both of them seemingly were
[56:19.420 --> 56:25.500]  surprised by their number of mail-in ballots which is odd because really you
[56:25.500 --> 56:29.620]  would think anywhere where you could send a mail-in ballot this year people
[56:29.620 --> 56:33.780]  would but they were surprised by the quality saying what's the rush right
[56:33.780 --> 56:37.820]  they were overwhelmed you couldn't have anticipated this right and so they've
[56:37.820 --> 56:42.100]  taken a longer to count whereas Pennsylvania has been saying since
[56:42.100 --> 56:47.380]  before the election there is no chance no chance that they will be able to
[56:47.380 --> 56:52.020]  count anywhere close to all the votes on Election Day no chance no chance no
[56:52.020 --> 56:58.180]  chance not only not on election night but probably not till Friday and over
[56:58.180 --> 57:01.340]  Pennsylvania is an extreme example but everybody everywhere has been saying
[57:01.340 --> 57:05.380]  it's like I said like let the chicken cook as hungry as you are and as much as
[57:05.380 --> 57:09.340]  you think the chicken should be done trust me you do not want to eat this
[57:09.340 --> 57:15.420]  before it's done cooking and then everybody's like whoa no I'm hungry I'm
[57:15.420 --> 57:24.180]  hungry just nine more I'm so hungry I need some kind of decisiveness this was
[57:24.180 --> 57:31.780]  a this is a slice of dark meat right yes no no that should this be purple
[57:31.780 --> 57:37.740]  different that we talked about this that you weren't gonna eat the chicken I'm
[57:37.740 --> 57:42.660]  very proud of this state this state's handling of this election the city's
[57:42.660 --> 57:47.260]  handling of it the entire state's handling of it has been extremely I love
[57:47.260 --> 57:51.220]  that mayor it's been extremely professional and they were ready for it
[57:51.220 --> 57:56.940]  they had a facility they had people they had webcams nice high quality high def
[57:56.940 --> 58:01.460]  cameras set up to anticipate that people might want to see that how this is going
[58:01.460 --> 58:06.980]  it's all been great and they were spot-on they said probably not until
[58:06.980 --> 58:10.420]  Friday then there was some talk that maybe they would finish Thursday night
[58:10.420 --> 58:15.300]  there was a lawsuit filed by a fellow named Trump yesterday that that caught
[58:15.300 --> 58:18.700]  them up account for a top account stop account well then they had a pause for a
[58:18.700 --> 58:23.140]  little bit to wait for something but they're only Allegheny had just dipped
[58:23.140 --> 58:27.060]  early on their own right that was not that was what had they had Allegheny
[58:27.060 --> 58:31.140]  Pittsburgh had to stop because of that or because they paused a little bit
[58:31.140 --> 58:34.980]  yesterday correct yeah I forget what the reason for that was but basically
[58:34.980 --> 58:39.060]  Pennsylvania's in the bank it's not even going to be that close it really isn't
[58:39.060 --> 58:42.340]  I'm telling you it's going to be over well over a hundred thousand votes and
[58:42.340 --> 58:47.340]  about one or two percent in the margin Arizona is interesting because Arizona
[58:47.340 --> 58:51.620]  they seemed like they were overwhelmed their votes that they are counting
[58:51.620 --> 58:56.180]  aren't over you know there's no particular Biden or Trump slant to them
[58:56.180 --> 59:00.820]  they're more in that 50-50 range so that's why people want to see them all
[59:00.820 --> 59:05.340]  counted you can't just say like with the Pennsylvania votes you could say look we
[59:05.340 --> 59:09.040]  know how many there are left there's a hundred and forty thousand of them we
[59:09.040 --> 59:14.300]  know Biden has been winning 80% of the mail-in votes these kinds of votes in
[59:14.300 --> 59:18.380]  this district are training strongly this right in this district so let's just say
[59:18.380 --> 59:22.220]  for the sake of argument let's say instead of the 80% he has been getting
[59:22.220 --> 59:29.140]  which we reasonably could say let's only get the gentleman 65 he's still 65 right
[59:29.140 --> 59:33.340]  which would be a huge swing statistically he would still win that's
[59:33.340 --> 59:38.240]  where we are in Pennsylvania and that's why it seems so solid and that 80%
[59:38.240 --> 59:42.540]  projection has been super consistent from Tuesday night through now Arizona's
[59:42.540 --> 59:46.380]  more 50-50 nobody they seem like they were surprised weren't ready for the
[59:46.380 --> 59:51.640]  count but the weird thing about Arizona is that Fox News which you know I don't
[59:51.640 --> 59:54.620]  know if you've heard of them they have they're known for having a bit of a
[59:54.620 --> 59:59.060]  political slant which you wouldn't think is against the president my sense
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.060]  and they would is that they would report that I would decide is am I getting
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:08.900]  something wrong and the Associated Press which is really the sort of standard of
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:14.780]  calling a presidential race right they called Arizona Tuesday night and nobody
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.820]  here we are Friday morning nobody else has called it they're still counting
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:21.500]  votes but it really does look like they were right it is closer they probably
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.500]  shouldn't have called it they're probably they probably but every step of
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.260]  the way when they might want to say we're gonna have to take that back and
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:35.060]  if I don't know if you remember do you remember the year 2000 you 2000 oh I
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:40.060]  feel like I feel like I do that's when we leave that our clock still worked and
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:47.620]  well 2000 2000 selection actually had calls that went back and forth there
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:52.260]  were calls of Florida for gore and then I think it was NBC News and they took it
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:57.020]  back and then there was Fox Gore had already claimed if memory serves the
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.780]  the indications were gonna be that he was gonna win he had hadn't been there
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:07.580]  no was it wasn't that he had conceded to Bush and then with three had to take
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.820]  them so what happened was NBC News said gore won Florida then they said well we
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.860]  take it back no good then Fox said okay we're calling it for Bush Bush wins
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:22.180]  Florida and then a couple other networks all said well if Fox is calling it we
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.580]  should call it and literally called it because Fox called it and then Gore said
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.420]  well if they're calling it I want to do the right thing and he picked up the
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.620]  phone and called him and said that you know it looks like you won I can see the
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:37.860]  election congratulations and then you know like that 20 minutes later they
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:42.940]  were like everybody realized that it was all because one guy at Fox decided to
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.580]  call it and there was no real reason for it and it was probably way too close to
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.020]  call not that it was wrong but that it and in fact we now know it really was it
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.140]  was like you take a divisive time which all the times feel ever since then but
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:00.740]  take a divisive time and then you make that so much worse by having an eroding
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:06.900]  sense but the kind of institutional truth right but there were call backs
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.940]  there were outlets that called it took it back right that the Arizona thing
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.060]  with the AP and Fox neither of them has taken it back they've they've sort they
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:20.900]  probably shouldn't have called it but in the intervening days as the counts gone
[01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:25.300]  on it still looks good that Biden's gonna win it Nevada it looks the same
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.420]  Nevada the similarity to Pennsylvania isn't in their preparation because one
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:33.860]  of the nice things about Pennsylvania is Pennsylvania has been reporting 10,000
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:39.580]  votes another 90 minutes go by here's another 10,000 votes another 90 minutes
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.660]  go by here's 10,000 votes Nevada is is frustrating and head scratching to
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.940]  people because they kind of went radio silent for a day there where they were
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:53.500]  like memes my kid is really enjoying be like you know Nevada going out to you
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:03:00.060]  know take a powder but compounding this difficulty my wife but is okay well you
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.700]  say you say this no say like I'm pounding this and at least in the
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:06.400]  scuttlebutt the media scuttlebutt is like Fox supposedly has been like a
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.340]  little bit of you probably shouldn't have done that but on top of it all like
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.500]  there wasn't that if you were gonna call along the lines they were calling Nevada
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:19.300]  really should have been called to in both cases you know but what are you
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.580]  gonna do are you gonna be the network like I don't know how much you're
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.020]  reading like the behind-the-scenes stuff with like Ashley Parker and Annie
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.860]  Carney everybody but like apparently I don't know if you know this but the
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:34.900]  White House is a little bit little bit frustrated with Fox News right now yeah
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.460]  and if Fox was the one that ended up essentially calling the entire if you
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:44.420]  call if you call Arizona which is ending up closer than a lot of people thought
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:47.900]  it was gonna be a few days ago and on top of that you call Nevada which would
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:52.180]  I believe put the vice president over the top oh boy are you gonna be in Dutch
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:57.900]  with the wet boy yeah right here's here's the weird dichotomy of this and
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:02.820]  we should start leaning towards wrapping this up yeah but a one or two percent is
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:10.300]  not a lot of percents right so it's not a hundred thousand votes is a lot of
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:15.220]  votes it is right so this is what your friend Bay Thompson calls the law of
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:18.140]  large numbers stuff gets weird when you're talking about like bigger than
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:23.820]  ten so let's take the state of Wisconsin which was weird so the the three states
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.540]  that really screwed Hillary Clinton four years ago were Wisconsin Michigan
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:31.260]  Pennsylvania they were all considered the quote-unquote blue wall wall and
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.660]  they've been blue and presidential elections for as long as anybody could
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.620]  remember which is only like 20 years you know I mean you go back to Reagan and
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.660]  it's you know a totally different map and everybody pretends like that's
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.860]  ancient history when it's really just I mean if you don't account for all the
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:49.020]  different demographic changes over the years but basically this year everybody
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.140]  thought look if Biden can turn Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania back to Democrat
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.780]  then he wins that's it doesn't matter don't worry about any other states those
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.900]  three states and the polls said they look all look good for Biden but in this
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.260]  order Wisconsin big big big for Biden there was a poll from ABC you know ABC
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:14.300]  in Washington Post you know not like rags who said your 17-point lead you
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.900]  know which everybody thought was an outlier in the midst of a huge flare-up
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.740]  in the pandemic in Wisconsin right and and everybody thought well that makes
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.940]  sense right a terrible flare-up everybody's like oh my god this is
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:29.060]  terrible we need to change Wisconsin was big for Biden Michigan in the middle
[01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.860]  Pennsylvania who a little too close for comfort and it looks like in reality
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:38.300]  they're in reverse where Pennsylvania is going to be finished with the biggest
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:45.180]  margin for Biden Michigan in the middle and Wisconsin was razor-thin 0.3% which
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.180]  is crazy and it you hate to think the fate of the Republic maybe the fate of
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.860]  democracy maybe the fate of Western civilization all hinges on something
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:06:01.220]  like that but also 0.3% in a big state like Michigan or Wisconsin is 20,000
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.100]  votes and 20,000 votes is actually a lot of votes I just think like somebody was
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:11.260]  on TV on MSNBC was talking about like just physically how big 20,000 like if
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:16.420]  you just put them into boxes how many I remember when I very first discovered
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:19.900]  site meter when I had a blog nobody had ever heard of and I installed site meter
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.820]  on my site and the thing that I've always said I've said this in talks for
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:28.940]  years is that you know if you when you get your first visit to your website
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.360]  your website just went up a hundred percent in invisibility I mean my math
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.780]  is not great but I think that's accurate it's it's just that you know different
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:41.700]  it depends on how much we're talking about here now for somebody like like in
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.700]  something like a presidential race it doesn't that may not seem like much you
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.180]  take all these places for granted based on your model in your in your polling
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.860]  you know I'm saying and then suddenly when that funnel gets smaller and
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.220]  smaller like you know but the proportions are still important and
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:59.780]  that's really confusing to people so how the president is saying how could it be
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:04.060]  that I had a 600,000 vote lead and now that has over two days gone down to this
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:07.360]  amount that must be crooked it's like no it's not that's just the funnel is
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.460]  narrowing in a way that has the percentage of that outstanding vote
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:17.540]  account that you're getting is changing and so yeah suddenly 1200 means a lot if
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:21.740]  your lead is 1200 that is not great Bob if there's another you know several
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.620]  thousand to come in isn't that we're talking about right no that's it you
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:32.220]  know so it's good you know he's got it and Nevada probably should have been
[01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:35.020]  called with Arizona but you're right that all of a sudden they're like well
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:38.140]  we kind of called this one early and if we call both of them then it's sort of
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.240]  like we're calling the elections over and people still want to see these
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.820]  things counted and honestly I think it's great for the I think it's great for the
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.060]  country that instead of calling stuff leaning towards calling it too early
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:52.140]  they're all leaning towards calling it too late and it's one of those things
[01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.820]  it's it's you know go back to high school math it's calculus where you you
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:08:00.580]  know you're approaching from one side or the other and as time goes on we get
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.980]  closer and closer and eventually you know you you're approaching you never
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:09.060]  quite get there to the true exact that's what I call it Zeno Zeno's election
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:14.540]  mm-hmm yeah but you know it's all it is way more responsible and better for the
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:19.740]  spirit of democracy in my opinion to err on the side of let's just let them count
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:24.680]  and then we'll call it but it's gonna happen the big surprise and then again
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.660]  Pennsylvania puts Biden over the top it's over Arizona and Nevada are almost
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.100]  certainly both Biden and that puts them even further over the top and therefore
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.240]  out of the reach of any one legal dispute in any one state and then the
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.700]  grave and then providing enough pretty enough if you like cushion to say like
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.300]  hey you know Dan sinker has been having fun with this on Twitter which is like
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:50.580]  oh yeah so so here we decided to throw the election but we're gonna throw the
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:54.280]  election in a way that we don't get a majority in the Senate and we lose seats
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.740]  in the house it's a really sophisticated strategy it basically involves every
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.060]  single person in America and we were so good at it that like in some ways we're
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:06.300]  worse apart from the presidency we're worse off than we were a week ago right
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:11.900]  and that the local of strategy the local district and state-level officials like
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:17.900]  senators and Congress people who have the most to lose by actually losing the
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:22.180]  election like Democrats running for Congress who lost even though they were
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:27.420]  slightly favored to win but Biden won in the district that they would have you
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:31.940]  know worked against their own interest to favor it for Biden but not for them
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:36.260]  while they were at it cooking the books think about the conventional wisdom
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.540]  people have about like I forget what the exact mixture is but people will say
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:44.580]  like we need this party to be you know federal executive and we need this party
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.340]  so like you might say like oh yeah I really want a Democratic president but a
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.060]  Republican governor there's there's certainly that there's the part that's
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.100]  been driving me crazy all along which is do we just want to keep assuming that
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:59.000]  every vote cast by a registered Republican is for the president and the
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.020]  corollary being every well this country is a lot more complicated than that you
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.580]  got a serious coastline of Scotland problem in this country which is the
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:10.420]  more closely you measure everything the longer that coastline gets the more you
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:13.700]  learn about every single different person there's there's no way to just
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.380]  go oh where my Latino is that like that's really that's not a very sound
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.380]  strategy so I mean I can see why people would say that because our people like
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.220]  our parents voted party line whatever that party was they were all the way up
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:31.060]  and down and I believe actually in some areas perhaps even the states you can
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:35.420]  choose to vote party line you could like hit one giant novelty sized button and
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:40.740]  say give me all the red hats we had you know we had that Pennsylvania yeah for
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.420]  my lifetime and in fact that we gave it up because it was considered to favor
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.380]  Democrats I don't know if it did or not but it was considered to I guess because
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:53.260]  they think that in the big cities the people just hit the big D button for
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.080]  Democrat so what happened in Pennsylvania was we wanted mail-in
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:02.140]  balloting to be statewide and the concession was okay we'll allow mail you
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.620]  know you can just vote by mail but get rid of okay it will get rid of straight
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:11.140]  ticket voting and the Democrats jumped on it and said sure because I think the
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:15.620]  Democrats rightly so thought that that D button wasn't actually the magic
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.780]  boogeyman for electing Democrats that Republicans thought they were and it
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:24.700]  again I really hate I think we did a good job four years ago I think we're
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:28.440]  doing a good job today of not being you know we're not wearing our blue sweaters
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.500]  here on this show but it really is true it's undeniably true that at a
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:37.020]  fundamental level Democrats really do are an aptly named party at least at the
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:41.020]  moment where they really do just want more people to be able to vote and just
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:45.300]  count them just let's get more names I mean through the manatee maybe I mean
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.020]  you know you're going into history I'm talking sorry sorry sorry right now this
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.860]  is crazy is this the point John where we say use that phrase in modern times like
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.580]  that's me in modern times in modern times he's the most disruptive president
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.660]  in modern times well who else give me another one I mean like you know you're
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.400]  gonna grow over Cleveland your way out of this really you're gonna cool edge

[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.540]  are your shoes on my mask they make my mask I wear their mask why are they only
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:30.420]  made in half sizes why do your shoes stink oh are your feet ache why are your
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.700]  shoes so uncomfortable Adams fixed all the annoying things about your shoes
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:39.020]  with their model zero sneaker I believe when I first got started wearing the
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.220]  model zero sneaker it didn't have a name I believe it was sort of like Apple
[01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.860]  Watch man now we call Apple Watch series zero it was just called Apple watch I
[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:52.220]  was wearing Adams when it was just Adams now it's called the model zero it moves
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:58.020]  with you throughout the day has elastic shoelaces that don't become untied
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.620]  features an odor fighting copper thread lining you'll feel like you're walking
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:07.020]  on clouds when you wear them they are perfect for long walks they come in
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.300]  quarter sizes quarter so I'm a nine point I have their nine point seven five
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:15.700]  shoes my left foots bigger than my right I forget the exact size of but I have it
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:19.140]  written down I have it safe but I think I'm not like a very partisan very
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.780]  partisan of your feet I think I'm like an 11 11 and a half on my left all right
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:28.020]  weird flex order yeah their masks are great too I love them the madams Adams
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.780]  mask that's I will not wear other masks other masks you know they call it a
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:37.020]  muzzle and in the in the red states I let them their mask it's everybody's got
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.460]  their own opinions about this but boy every single day I have extras I've
[01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:43.700]  deployed them like I would have with pairs of scissors that will disappear I
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:47.300]  put the mask all around in all the places and there's always one one of my
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.980]  backpack one in my pocket all the time here's my favorite thing about the masks
[01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:55.660]  is we went as a country we went from can you believe we all have to wear masks
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.700]  we can't believe we all have to wear masks I thought it was weird everybody
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.340]  thought it was weird it's weird don't don't worry about that like too many
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.740]  people are still who don't want to wear masks are still hung up on my home I
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.860]  Howard Hughes I'm gonna wear it with you baby it's the weirdest thing in the
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.380]  world but my my favorite thing is who would have thought we'd all have
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:19.420]  abundance of drawers full of masks and preferences and strong preferences the
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:22.420]  way that like if you're like a dinky guy and you like all your different watches
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.340]  in your fancy little palette like oh this is gonna be my day to evening mask
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:30.580]  here's the thing I love about the Adams mask I well number one is made out of
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.660]  the same odor fighting material as the insert of their shoe and it does it
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.780]  keeps it keeps my bad breath from stinking up the mask I'm a big fan I'm a
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.980]  big promoter I've told people this just keep keep your mask by your Altoids and
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.340]  just pop a couple of mints in there before you put your mask on but what's
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.860]  nice is with the sort of odor fighting technology of the Adams mask mine mine
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.580]  keeps a minty it keeps a minty smell that's lovely I think the masks have
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.940]  really helped America understand that they are probably drinking too much
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:01.900]  coffee because then when you leave the house you realize you got the coffee
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:06.100]  breath Jon Stewart I saw John Stewart on Colbert me is that me well months ago
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.060]  that's me Joe John Stewart said I would like to apologize to everybody I've ever
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:24.140]  encountered in my life smell after you floss that's you yes yeah yeah give it
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:28.900]  here that that was the trick I for those who don't know the trick is if you ever
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.820]  want to get in a habit of flossing floss your teeth one time and then smell the
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.900]  flaws and then once you do this you'll realize oh my god I need to floss all
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.300]  the time it'll make you want to floss well that's what wearing a mask is to
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.620]  your breath anyway but the other thing I love about the Adam style for me
[01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:48.100]  personally maybe for you it's different but they're stitched down the middle and
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:53.660]  it kind of gives it a fold over the nose and mouth that keeps it you know as
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:59.180]  opposed to a one-piece that to me is always touching absolutely makes you a
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:03.100]  little bit aerodynamic like like some kind of like a like a shark yeah yeah
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.060]  well it's like you know it's like putting your hands in front of your face
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:10.220]  you know like easy easy to put on my god where are we in life that we're talking
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.140]  about there's like a given mask well and they also have sizes I know it you know
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:20.020]  turns out I've got a big fat head you know I feel like I'm going to Ted
[01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:23.300]  Kennedy style you know what I mean like we're by the end of Ted Kennedy's life
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:26.940]  oh like that he once said like like Conan O'Brien once said he said I don't
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:31.540]  have a head I have a case for a head you're thinking you think about becoming
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:34.900]  very large headed in your later life yeah get the gym blossoms and everything
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.500]  there's no question about it I happen to know you know and I'm a baseball fan and
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.340]  I happen to know that for most of my adult life I was a seven and a quarter
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:48.580]  fitted cap size seven and a quarter yeah and and then I felt like it was getting
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:51.740]  a little snug and I bought a seven and three eights and that it too was too
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:56.260]  snug and I'm up to a seven and a half so I've gone up my head is absolutely
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:17:02.140]  growing in size I it's like Adam said to Eve stand back I don't know how big this
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.780]  thing gets them so I have quite a few quite a few of my masks are way too
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:09.900]  tight they pull my ears forward I look a little comical they look a job no good

[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.940]  say to people and and if we lifted your spirits and we've heard I've you've
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.700]  seen it we didn't want to spoil it we don't want to talk about it but people
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.340]  have said that they've listened back to the show four years ago that's the
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:30.500]  nothing a person could say it's very nice it's very nice and when you and I
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:35.060]  have had that success before we did a thing at South by Southwest boy about
[01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:38.900]  that time we saw that that one guy in the bar and he was tilting at
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:43.900]  approximately six degrees and moaning oh no he was on the street is that where
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:50.020]  it was he was having some verticality issues and I don't know if that was
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:53.660]  accounted for in the past judgment I don't know me neither hakuna matata
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:57.860]  what's next John let's get out of this yeah very nice thank you to everybody
[01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:01.940]  who said that that means the world to me and and you know and I think the people
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.100]  who needed it and felt like they felt better because of it they don't need it
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.660]  this year well you know we got this but what I'm hearing so there was a first
[01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:13.940]  level sense of dread four years ago and this is this is what really had me done
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.820]  and it wasn't it wasn't in the way that I would have felt down if if Barack
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:25.140]  Obama had lost to John McCain or to Mitt Romney four years later it wasn't the
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:31.260]  way that I felt down when John Kerry did lose to George W Bush in 2004 even after
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:36.300]  what I thought was four years of some pretty crummy policy and and and you
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:42.900]  know there was a war did the you know didn't wasn't so well considered etc and
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:48.420]  so forth I felt worse four years ago hopefully worse than I'll ever feel
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.420]  after any election not because my preferred candidate didn't win but
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.220]  because I could see how this was going to go bad I could see that this was
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:04.700]  going to involve clowns being appointed to important positions that you cannot
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:09.420]  have a clown right that yeah it's like that Michael Michael Lewis book all
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.860]  these things that we thought of is really really really boring
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:17.060]  infrastructure donkey drills actually have huge impacts like you don't want
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:21.460]  somebody at energy where the nuclear things live you don't want somebody who
[01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:25.100]  doesn't know what they're doing or got in because they bought room service at a
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:31.020]  Trump hotel the guy who originally had that job Rick Perry the former governor
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.500]  of Texas didn't know what the Department of Energy did he tried hadn't he tried
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:40.780]  to see the way he tried to abolish it in some way was that him yeah dancing with
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:47.940]  stars memory serves yeah then yeah after after he got he got promoted for being
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.780]  good frames can make you look smart but it can't make you be smart he was just
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:57.580]  the more you know from Rick Perry he was the good Trump nominee for Department of
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:02.980]  Energy then he left and and you know the real you can see how this would happen
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:07.500]  and and you didn't know what it would be but a very few presidents go through
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.700]  four years without a significant crisis and the whole point of these crises is
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.460]  that you don't know what they are you don't know when it's going to be a
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:18.900]  meteoric you know coming in and you got to send Bruce Willis and the gang up
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:23.140]  there to blow it up and you don't know when it's gonna be a pandemic you know
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:26.340]  I don't want anything you know yeah there's no there's no if you don't have
[01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.780]  the interest if you don't have the fear somebody once said of the George W Bush
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.980]  he's probably the most incurious president we've ever had and boy now
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.340]  today it's not even just the ink I'm sorry I interrupted you but it's just
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:42.260]  god damn it we knew but it was also the cognitive dissonance of how could this
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.780]  happen what did I miss about my country that I could get this so wrong and I
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:49.220]  could be spending the next four years of my dick in my hand trying to figure out
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:54.140]  if I lose my goddamn mind it was it was very very difficult now when somebody
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:56.700]  like Joe like a John Kerry loses that sucks because they said some terrible
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.980]  things about him but that's more like your local minor league team not winning
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:04.180]  but this one it was more like no like this is this is not the sport you
[01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:07.900]  thought it was and you've been a fan of the wrong thing and now you're gonna be
[01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:13.100]  so confused and sad and incapable of disappearing into joy for the next four
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.620]  years if you're lucky remember that dumb thing I said at the end we both said I
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:20.460]  think we'll be fine remember that when we said that yeah that's what I regret
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:30.300]  that's a regret of mine I didn't believe you yeah well but I here's what I want
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.300]  to say here's my parting message to everybody listening is God bless you I'm
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.620]  glad you're listening I thank you for your good words before but I hear it
[01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.300]  already where people are saying well how could this be so close and they're down
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.580]  again they're already down how could this be so close how could we not take
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.500]  the Senate to how could we lose a couple of seats in the house blah blah blah I
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:57.340]  agree it there's part of me that wants to wants to you know ask certain people
[01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:01.460]  who voted a certain way what the hell are you thinking what were you thinking
[01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:07.220]  four years ago how after all of this you know there was a it was an idea four
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:12.700]  years ago that this Trump fellow he says crazy things but he's not going to do
[01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:16.540]  crazy things right that how many times you hear that right I say what are they
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:21.860]  say nicely but not seriously but not literally right he he did crazier things
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.260]  than he said that hell the stuff that he said was less crazy than the stuff that
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:31.020]  he did he didn't say he was gonna separate three-year-old kids from their
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:36.660]  parents at the border and put them into cages I mean this is crazy stuff I mean
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.660]  it really sad and and you know I'm not making light of it I'm saying that it's
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.020]  no you've really got to go back and like with all the ways we try to survive
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:49.140]  emotionally and mentally you got to go back and re-experience all those things
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:53.060]  and to find people on both sides and Adam Schlesinger from Fountains of
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:57.260]  Wayne is dead because of kovat or like the George Floyd or whatever it is you
[01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:01.300]  have to go back and walk back through each one of those like hysterically
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:06.420]  painful things that just made America into a mouth with many missing teeth
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:11.660]  it's just been brutal what I want to say to all of you who are depressed about
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:17.100]  the margin of victory is that a win is a win and there is there is there are the
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:22.660]  stakes are entirely different between sports ball and politics because
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:27.340]  politics is as real as it gets that's where kids will actually wind up in
[01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.220]  cages and and pandemics wind up spreading across the country coast to
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:37.420]  coast and killing people and making people sick and real real real things
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:41.220]  and it was sports ball there's a team in blue jerseys and there's a team in green
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:44.380]  jerseys and one of them sad and one of them is happy and that's really the
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:49.160]  ultimately all there is but the similarity with elections is the
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.900]  elections are a sport and you might be a hundred percent convinced that your team
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:58.420]  is the better team than the other team a hundred percent and that you should
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:03.340]  probably win this football game by thirty five points going away but it's
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:07.500]  the Super Bowl it's the big thing the bookies even say it the bookies have you
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:12.100]  up by two touchdowns you're gonna you're gonna run away with this game and you
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:17.340]  end up but on any given Sunday and you end up you're down it's the second half
[01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:23.740]  you're actually behind some of your fans are our porn porn whiskey right down
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:27.060]  into their eye sockets because they can't take it they think it's all over
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:34.140]  it they saw this happen before but your team sticks to the plan they
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:38.700]  marched down the field the end of the game they kick a field goal they win by
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:44.180]  three and they win that team celebrates when when that's over that field goal
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:47.740]  goes through the clock goes to zero and they're in there and they get the hand
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.100]  them the trophy there's no difference in the celebration the amount of champagne
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:56.260]  they're dunking on their heads and stuff like that you won win is a win right
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:01.420]  that's the thing this in a certain sixth sense as close as it was you'd like it
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.980]  to work better but it works you win and then do you get started and you move on
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:10.260]  you go to the next one don't give up but you keep going it's it's all good you
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:13.300]  know it's not the best but it's good there's no reason to be down nobody
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:19.100]  should be down about this this is a triumph of logic and and empathy over
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:27.340]  over the opposite whatever the opposite of the Trump I guess that's good
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:32.740]  whenever you're whenever something to think about I think that I think there's
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.660]  nothing more tragic than a failed romantic I think when you feel like your
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.100]  heart's been broken over and over it's difficult not to become the sort of
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:45.660]  person that goes online and says law nothing matters I don't know maybe it
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:50.180]  does maybe doesn't but like um the problem one problem with law nothing
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:53.660]  matters and like whatever everybody's all the same well not only is that the
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.580]  kind of thing Putin says but there might be somebody in your life for whom that
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.580]  does matter I don't want to bust a gut but like even more than four years ago
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:06.540]  I'm very attuned to what these sorts of things mean for one particular person
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:12.460]  that I care a lot about and like I don't want a model law that matters for people
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.540]  for whom it does matter that's been a huge change for me and I'm not saying I
[01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:22.180]  I mean I I do what I can I could probably do more but like it's it does
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:28.140]  matter and there's gonna be the good days and the bad days but like um don't
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.660]  cut yourself off completely not only just from the normal emotions we used to
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:35.820]  be able to enjoy for more than two seconds but like be careful about
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:42.860]  letting the world redefine your horizons as being incredibly limited and hopeless
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.100]  I'm not I'm not trying to be Pollyanna everybody needs to do this in a different
[01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:51.820]  way but like if we if we do just in some back part of our non lizard brain
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:55.660]  imagine that things could be better than they are right this minute that's still
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:58.580]  a little bit of hope you know it's like Ted lasso says it's the last of way you
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:04.180]  got a belief and I'm not saying like put on blinders but like remember that
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.980]  there's somebody in your life that you care about where it does matter and like
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:13.500]  to to go fully fully bleak hyper normalization is is not gonna not only
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.620]  is it not gonna help anybody contrary to your gut it's not gonna make you feel
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:22.740]  better and it's not gonna protect you you've got you got to put up you got to
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:28.740]  tape up that little believe sign I god damn it I love that show I would like to
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.140]  think I would like to think with this as thin as some of these margins are maybe
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:36.580]  Ted lasso had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a say in this
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:40.380]  election you know maybe a thousand votes here thousand votes well I'm like I'm
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:45.100]  not about to well only put this way episode I want to say nine which I
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:48.940]  didn't love as much as eight the first time I watched it but I came back to it
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:53.580]  and I was like you know what there's a healing power to forgiveness that really
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.860]  comes across the second time you watch that episode everybody's just forgiving
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.500]  each other left and right and I'm not saying like we're all ready to go like
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.580]  extend a hand and like have some kind of pipes of peace moment with two different
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:06.380]  Paul McCartney's I'm not saying that at all but what I am saying there's
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.300]  probably somebody in your life that could that could benefit from having a
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:13.540]  little bit of forgiveness and maybe one of those people is you you know how does
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:18.060]  it show yeah such a good show that your your statement there was so sweet I was
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.180]  gonna end with this joke and I feel like a jerk for it but I'm gonna do well
[01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:24.500]  let's each commit to a joke do it this is my one of my favorite jokes and this
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:28.620]  is who I want you I want you not to be this this is this is a joke as a Jewish
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.420]  grandmother and she's walking with her young son down to the beach and it's a
