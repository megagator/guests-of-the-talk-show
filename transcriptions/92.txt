[00:00.000 --> 00:03.400]  breaking news to see Steve Ballmer step down from the Microsoft
[00:03.400 --> 00:03.800]  port.
[00:03.900 --> 00:07.600]  I did. I did. I love him so much. So it's hard for me.
[00:07.800 --> 00:11.120]  I'm kind of happy for him, though, because I feel like he's
[00:11.120 --> 00:14.000]  already he's already got like a big new thing.
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.200]  Yeah, no, he's found he's found his next windows, you know.
[00:20.500 --> 00:24.500]  Yeah. Did you see the video of him at the like the verse opening so
[00:24.500 --> 00:28.600]  good? He's going to be such a great owner. Clipper's fans don't know
[00:28.600 --> 00:29.500]  how good they're going to get it.
[00:29.500 --> 00:32.300]  I mean, this just could have been like this probably what he
[00:32.300 --> 00:34.100]  should have been doing for 20 years.
[00:34.900 --> 00:38.800]  I do. I kind of I do kind of feel like that. I do. And I feel
[00:38.800 --> 00:44.900]  like, you know, I mean, as a Yankees fan, I'm partial to the
[00:44.900 --> 00:48.400]  bigger than life owner, like George Steinbrenner, which is
[00:48.400 --> 00:52.400]  exactly what Ballmer is, except maybe he's maybe a little a
[00:52.400 --> 01:00.400]  little bit. Believe it or not, a little bit less angry. I mean,
[01:00.800 --> 01:03.100]  the guy goes how to keep his cool, though, if you've ever seen
[01:03.100 --> 01:06.800]  the video on YouTube where he's at like a German press
[01:06.800 --> 01:11.600]  conference and somebody throws something at him. Oh, yeah,
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.500]  yeah. And he does he's completely on phase, like it doesn't
[01:15.500 --> 01:18.600]  really bother him, right? You know, and he just like keeps
[01:18.600 --> 01:22.800]  doubting Microsoft propaganda. And like, it's a really
[01:22.800 --> 01:25.000]  matter at all to him that he just got hit in the face by some
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.300]  German. Yeah.
[01:28.500 --> 01:30.400]  And I can't help it think too. I mean, number one, he's
[01:30.400 --> 01:33.500]  super competitive guy. I mean, he wants to win. This is a guy
[01:33.500 --> 01:36.000]  he didn't buy the Clippers just on the team. He wants to win
[01:36.000 --> 01:41.100]  NBA titles. Whereas the old owner, the dingbat racist guys
[01:41.100 --> 01:45.100]  Sterling, for decades, the Clippers were like a joke in the
[01:45.100 --> 01:49.000]  NBA. And they only got good in the last few years by by lock
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.500]  by a trade that nobody thought was going to be good that
[01:51.500 --> 01:55.400]  turned out to be fantastic for him. So it's great news for
[01:55.400 --> 01:58.000]  the Clippers fans because he's going to want to win. And I
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.800]  can't help but think that like his tech background is going
[02:01.800 --> 02:05.400]  to make, you know, sort of as the NBA sort of pushes in that
[02:05.400 --> 02:09.900]  moneyball direction of looking at stats and metrics that
[02:09.900 --> 02:12.200]  people didn't look at before. And I think that's one
[02:12.200 --> 02:15.300]  reason Mark Cuban's been a good owner for the Dallas Mavericks
[02:15.300 --> 02:16.500]  that they've been pretty successful.
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.500]  Now I've gotten into this like rapid thing of finding, you
[02:19.500 --> 02:22.000]  know, there was that thing that he threw a through a chair
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.100]  across a room a couple of years ago.
[02:24.400 --> 02:26.400]  Right. It was like when it when there was like a key
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.400]  employee who he wanted to he wanted to keep and the guy was
[02:29.400 --> 02:32.000]  like, you know what, I think I'm going to Google and right.
[02:32.400 --> 02:34.100]  The guy's like, you know what, there's nothing you can say
[02:34.100 --> 02:38.300]  I'm going to Google. I mean like through a chair. But to your
[02:38.300 --> 02:40.500]  point, like there's no, you know, this is a passionate
[02:40.500 --> 02:44.800]  passionate man. Yeah. And chair throwing as like a nice
[02:44.800 --> 02:47.500]  history in basketball, Bobby Bobby Knight, the old college
[02:47.500 --> 02:51.200]  coach at Indiana used to like throwing chairs at referees.
[02:51.800 --> 02:55.500]  Not sure that'll fly on the court, but I will definitely
[02:55.500 --> 02:57.800]  disappoint you for the next hour or whatever we're going
[02:57.800 --> 03:00.300]  to be talking about talking about sports.
[03:00.300 --> 03:02.900]  No, we're talking about bombers personality.
[03:03.500 --> 03:06.400]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying I can't really throw the same
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.600]  ball. No, yeah, curve ball, if you will. Is that good? Is that
[03:10.600 --> 03:14.400]  good? Can we edit in some left track there?
[03:18.400 --> 03:21.200]  And I do think I think it's kind of I there were rumors that
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.600]  he was not going to be long on the Microsoft board that, you
[03:24.600 --> 03:27.600]  know, that they did public relations wise, it's, you know,
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.200]  it was an orderly transition, but it's it's more like a
[03:33.200 --> 03:37.100]  divorce than a, you know, an amicable.
[03:38.100 --> 03:39.200]  Right. Transition.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.900]  Yeah, which is sad.
[03:43.600 --> 03:46.900]  Yeah, it kind of is because boy, he have a good run.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.900]  Yeah, a good run and, you know, that'll talk about dedication
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.700]  to a company. I mean, like, you know, that's what we're
[03:53.700 --> 03:57.200]  talking about this passion. He's he's so passionate about
[03:57.200 --> 04:01.400]  Microsoft, like if I even, you know, when he had stepped
[04:01.400 --> 04:03.700]  down or when the resignation thing happened, I was like,
[04:03.700 --> 04:06.600]  you know, that's that's a sad thing to lose for a company,
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.400]  which is like a CEO that it's just that incredibly passionate
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.600]  about about everything that comes out of that company.
[04:13.900 --> 04:17.300]  Yeah, like, you know, he was never one of these guys who, who
[04:17.300 --> 04:22.000]  was just going to be a CEO of a company and that may be
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.400]  you know, someday he would leave and go to Oracle. Another
[04:25.400 --> 04:27.900]  company, you know, right? No, that was never going to happen.
[04:27.900 --> 04:29.200]  He was a Microsoft guy.
[04:29.200 --> 04:33.000]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, as you know, I love this company. It was like
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  it he did. He really, oh, he does. I'm sure he still does.
[04:37.100 --> 04:39.500]  That's what he says in that letter. You did you read the letter
[04:39.500 --> 04:41.900]  he posted on one drive? No, I did not.
[04:42.600 --> 04:46.800]  Um, I obviously tweeted that he could have used clippies
[04:46.800 --> 04:49.000]  help to form out the letter because the letter is literally
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.200]  like dear Satya, paragraphs, Steve, like it's like really
[04:56.300 --> 04:58.300]  after all this time, you couldn't have just used one of the
[04:58.300 --> 05:03.100]  templates and word, um, I tweeted the link here, but.
[05:05.200 --> 05:08.500]  Well, you have been super busy this month. You're all, I guess
[05:08.500 --> 05:11.400]  you're always busy, but you're not one of these, uh, taken off
[05:11.400 --> 05:12.400]  for August people.
[05:12.400 --> 05:15.700]  No. And, uh, guess who, guess who's getting married right
[05:15.700 --> 05:19.300]  before or right after the iPhone launch or the rumored iPhone
[05:19.300 --> 05:19.800]  launch?
[05:20.200 --> 05:21.800]  Right, right before or right after?
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.700]  Well, uh, if things go according to rumor and speculation,
[05:27.700 --> 05:33.000]  or if they follow a historical pattern, we will see an
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.700]  announcement on Tuesday.
[05:35.100 --> 05:35.500]  September.
[05:35.500 --> 05:39.600]  Santa will get married on that Sunday on the 14th.
[05:40.100 --> 05:43.700]  And then an iPhone would probably as historically has
[05:43.700 --> 05:46.900]  happened launch the week after or the week after that. I'm
[05:46.900 --> 05:48.000]  assuming the week after.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.600]  Yeah. I thought, yeah, usually on a Friday. So I'm guessing
[05:50.600 --> 05:51.300]  the 19th.
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.900]  Yeah. So I, you know, I picked a great time to get married.
[05:56.900 --> 06:00.200]  Are you immediately, uh, well, congratulations, number one,
[06:00.200 --> 06:03.300]  but number two, are you, are you, are you immediately leaving
[06:03.300 --> 06:07.900]  on a honeymoon or no honeymoon is scheduled for a different,
[06:08.000 --> 06:11.300]  different time honeymoon is scheduled for the end of October
[06:11.300 --> 06:12.300]  beginning of November.
[06:12.800 --> 06:16.000]  All right. So your iPhone review and theory, you, your, your
[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  iPhone review could, uh, your camera pictures could be from the
[06:19.000 --> 06:22.100]  bride's perspective of the wedding. That would be kind of
[06:22.100 --> 06:29.500]  amazing. Well, yes, but you, the other bride, my, my fiance, she
[06:29.500 --> 06:35.100]  will probably murder me if I'm reviewing an iPhone during the
[06:35.100 --> 06:36.400]  week of the wedding.
[06:38.900 --> 06:43.800]  Yeah, that reminds me of the funniest thing from the summer,
[06:43.800 --> 06:47.200]  which was you were a bride's maiden in a friend's wedding, and
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.300]  you were testing the, the Android wear smartwatches. She told
[06:52.300 --> 06:55.100]  you that if you tried to wear it during the wedding, you're out.
[06:55.400 --> 06:55.900]  All right.
[06:56.100 --> 06:58.700]  Total, at totally happened, like I wore that to the rehearsal
[06:58.700 --> 07:02.700]  dinner the night before. And she was like, what is that? I was
[07:02.700 --> 07:06.700]  like, it's just my, it's my new watch. It's my new smartphone
[07:06.700 --> 07:10.100]  glued to my, to my wrist. And she's like, if you wear that
[07:10.100 --> 07:11.700]  tomorrow, so you don't even come.
[07:12.700 --> 07:15.700]  And so I, you know, yes, I had to stage a little bit of this
[07:15.700 --> 07:19.500]  of the soundbite when she was in her beautiful dress, but that
[07:19.500 --> 07:20.900]  was, that was very much a true story.
[07:21.200 --> 07:23.100]  Yeah, but anyway, congratulations.
[07:23.900 --> 07:26.600]  But you're going to go, you'll, you'll still be out for the
[07:26.600 --> 07:29.500]  event, assuming everything again, assuming every, we talk about
[07:29.500 --> 07:32.400]  it like it's a done deal. But assuming everything happens as, as
[07:32.400 --> 07:36.400]  expected, you'll be out for the event and then come back East
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.600]  later in a week. Right?
[07:38.700 --> 07:41.200]  Yeah. Yeah. If yes, exactly.
[07:41.200 --> 07:46.500]  I do think, I do think that that is going to happen that, you
[07:46.500 --> 07:50.300]  know, rumors are true. And I mean, that makes sense given the
[07:50.300 --> 07:54.400]  timing, but it is funny too of watching the rest of the
[07:54.400 --> 07:57.900]  industry line up around that because everybody I think Samsung
[07:57.900 --> 07:58.900]  has an event.
[08:00.600 --> 08:03.800]  Or I'm very busy leading up to this wedding.
[08:04.500 --> 08:05.300]  Very busy.
[08:05.500 --> 08:08.600]  I think that the Samsung one is going to be on the third. It's
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.700]  like, everybody, you know, do you want to go after do you want to
[08:10.700 --> 08:13.100]  go before? And I think most people are like, oh, we want
[08:13.100 --> 08:16.800]  Samsung has usually does this before because if out of Berlin
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.300]  is the same is the same time, you know, every year. And so they
[08:20.300 --> 08:24.300]  do the note announcement there and, you know, Sony announces some
[08:24.300 --> 08:28.700]  stuff that I'm not really sure people notice and who else does
[08:28.700 --> 08:31.400]  stuff around there. Sometimes HGC, but I guess not really this
[08:31.400 --> 08:31.800]  year.
[08:33.500 --> 08:38.500]  And then Motorola has an event like that Friday or that Thursday
[08:38.500 --> 08:41.700]  before it's that's the fourth.
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.000]  So yeah, good times.
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.200]  Yeah, and there's the added possibility that that this will
[08:47.200 --> 08:50.100]  be the event. And again, this is just speculation, but it
[08:50.100 --> 08:54.100]  could be that coincident with the iPhone Apple will have
[08:54.100 --> 08:59.100]  their wearable stuff long, long rumored, supposedly imminent
[08:59.200 --> 09:01.800]  wearable stuff if, you know, which would probably.
[09:02.800 --> 09:05.200]  Well, I don't know. It's a questionable whether that
[09:05.200 --> 09:07.500]  would come out at the same time. Maybe the reviews would be,
[09:07.500 --> 09:09.500]  you know, maybe they'd announce it then and it would come
[09:09.500 --> 09:11.800]  out at a different time, but could be a lot of stuff to
[09:11.800 --> 09:12.100]  review.
[09:12.500 --> 09:14.600]  Well, everyone jumped on something you said a couple of weeks
[09:14.600 --> 09:15.900]  ago, right? Yeah.
[09:17.300 --> 09:20.400]  And by the way, I didn't really read that as like that was
[09:20.700 --> 09:23.500]  your inside sources. And I know you kind of refuted that.
[09:24.300 --> 09:26.700]  That's because you're not stupid.
[09:27.300 --> 09:28.500]  I mean, I was cracking a joke.
[09:29.300 --> 09:32.400]  Yeah, I I would think that was not going to happen at the
[09:32.400 --> 09:35.600]  same event as the iPhone, but that said, I don't I really
[09:35.600 --> 09:38.100]  don't know much. And I think it's really hard to talk about
[09:38.100 --> 09:40.600]  some of this health kit stuff without talking about that
[09:40.600 --> 09:42.700]  product. But again, I don't really know.
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.200]  Yeah, I talked about this a little bit last week, but it's to
[09:45.200 --> 09:48.900]  me it was just just a guess trying to crack a joke about what
[09:48.900 --> 09:53.400]  if the the Moto 270 doesn't come out until after Apple announces
[09:53.400 --> 09:54.000]  their thing.
[09:55.500 --> 09:59.100]  Well, it looks like the Moto 270 will come out before and it
[09:59.100 --> 10:01.100]  will be close to $270.
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.400]  Yeah, I saw that too. And it made me laugh.
[10:04.400 --> 10:10.400]  No, when do they say that the Moto 360 is going to the rumored
[10:10.400 --> 10:11.100]  really state?
[10:12.100 --> 10:14.400]  It's like imminent. It's like cup like sometime in the next
[10:14.400 --> 10:14.900]  week or so.
[10:15.100 --> 10:19.100]  I think they are holding this event on September.
[10:20.100 --> 10:22.400]  I got to look through my inbox, but they're holding an event
[10:22.400 --> 10:26.400]  in in September in Chicago, I believe. So that's
[10:26.400 --> 10:27.100]  said and see that.
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.900]  Yeah. And then the then the pricing lead to this weekend on
[10:29.900 --> 10:34.200]  Best Buy for $250 for the Moto 270 or 360.
[10:34.200 --> 10:37.700]  I'm actually excited about this. I mean, I know a lot of
[10:37.700 --> 10:40.700]  people when I put it on at Google, I owe where people were
[10:40.700 --> 10:42.200]  saying that I was wearing a.
[10:43.300 --> 10:45.600]  What were they saying I was wearing on my on my wrist?
[10:46.100 --> 10:48.200]  Some you might have made a great joke about what I was
[10:48.200 --> 10:49.200]  wearing on my wrist.
[10:49.700 --> 10:51.500]  That's possible. I don't remember that.
[10:52.100 --> 10:54.200]  I don't know a monocle or something like that.
[10:56.100 --> 10:58.900]  But I mean, you know, it's I think it's the first smartwatch
[10:58.900 --> 11:02.500]  that comes closest to looking like a watch definitely is
[11:02.500 --> 11:06.000]  very big. The face is big and I know there's been some
[11:06.600 --> 11:10.600]  issues about how the screen isn't really fully a circle.
[11:11.400 --> 11:14.700]  But it looks cool. Definitely looks better than the than
[11:14.700 --> 11:17.200]  the two the algae and the Samsung that I've had I've
[11:17.200 --> 11:18.700]  worn throughout the summer.
[11:18.900 --> 11:23.500]  Yeah, but I still I concur with your review of the earlier to
[11:23.500 --> 11:27.500]  the where it's just highly questionable weather. I mean,
[11:27.500 --> 11:29.700]  for some people, of course, some people, you know, you can
[11:29.700 --> 11:32.100]  find some people who want everything, you know, any idea
[11:32.100 --> 11:36.100]  under the sun. But the idea of getting a buzz on your wrist
[11:36.100 --> 11:39.700]  every single time you get a notification is to me, it's it
[11:39.700 --> 11:44.000]  sounds like punishment. It is. It does it doesn't appeal to me
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.800]  and I don't have the type of job.
[11:46.500 --> 11:50.900]  And I don't think many people do where I'm always on on the
[11:50.900 --> 11:52.700]  alert for like an emergency.
[11:53.400 --> 11:56.800]  You know, I could totally see how like I don't know
[11:56.800 --> 11:59.900]  somebody who works in a hospital might want to have a watch
[11:59.900 --> 12:02.900]  that that every single time that buzz is they really do want to
[12:02.900 --> 12:05.900]  look because it could be a serious emergency. I could see
[12:05.900 --> 12:08.900]  that me. I don't need that. And when I've had my put my
[12:08.900 --> 12:13.900]  pebble hooked up to my iPhone and just moving alerts to my
[12:13.900 --> 12:17.100]  wrist, it just feels like I'm punishing myself.
[12:17.900 --> 12:20.500]  Right. And then, you know, that's one of the things I had
[12:20.700 --> 12:24.300]  spoken to Google about before the review and then obviously
[12:24.300 --> 12:27.000]  pointed out in the review is that there needs to be deeper
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.800]  customization of that. But even then, you know, you really
[12:29.800 --> 12:33.500]  wonder, do we want to be sort of fussing with that kind of
[12:33.500 --> 12:36.300]  settings type of thing? I mean, even just dealing with
[12:36.300 --> 12:40.100]  notifications on my phone is like and setting them up and
[12:40.100 --> 12:43.500]  what apps ping me when they do this or visit my retweets or
[12:43.500 --> 12:47.500]  its mentions or if it's email from this account, you know,
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.700]  that in itself is a big task to do. So it's easiest for
[12:51.700 --> 12:54.900]  these companies to just say, if it hits the front lock screen
[12:54.900 --> 12:57.000]  of your phone, then it will hit your wrist.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.400]  Yeah, but it needs to be deeper than that, but they have to
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.300]  do it in a way where it's not really completely frustrating
[13:04.300 --> 13:07.400]  to figure out how to get those things there. Yeah, of course,
[13:07.400 --> 13:09.400]  a lot of people and I would argue that a lot of people who
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.600]  own Android phones don't mind tinkering with that kind of
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.400]  stuff. But I would also say that even then that that's
[13:15.400 --> 13:16.100]  overwhelming.
[13:16.600 --> 13:21.700]  Yeah, and it's it is so true to that you get a new app and
[13:21.700 --> 13:24.800]  you launch it and you're using this new thing and it's going
[13:24.800 --> 13:27.600]  to be sending you notifications. And it just says this app
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.600]  would like to send you notifications allow or disallow. And
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.000]  then if you're one tab, you say, okay, yes, because I want
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.400]  to get these notifications. That's super easy. It's easy to
[13:36.400 --> 13:40.400]  opt in, but then everything after that in terms of fine tuning,
[13:40.500 --> 13:43.300]  you know, how much and what you get, it just always seems
[13:43.300 --> 13:47.200]  like busy work. And and it what seems like a good idea when
[13:47.200 --> 13:50.600]  you first install the app, it just sometimes can be one of
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.000]  those, you know, frog in a slow boiling pot type thing where
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  first you don't really notice. And then like a month or two
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  and you're like, why am I getting all these notifications
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  from this app? This is this is overkill. My whole right, my whole
[14:03.000 --> 14:06.000]  lock screen is dominated by these stupid notifications from
[14:06.000 --> 14:06.400]  this one.
[14:07.400 --> 14:10.400]  Yeah, I mean, I've gotten pretty good about on my iPhone
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.700]  customizing what hits the lock screen. But that was after
[14:14.700 --> 14:18.300]  quite a bit of tweaking and settings stuff.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.900]  Yeah, but I still you're right, I get like random alerts from
[14:22.900 --> 14:25.700]  apps I haven't, you know, I once downloaded for testing or
[14:25.700 --> 14:30.000]  something. And it's like, you know, do this. Like brush my
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.300]  teeth. I reviewed that Bluetooth toothbrush a couple of
[14:33.300 --> 14:37.000]  months ago. And I actually been still using the toothbrush,
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.400]  but I don't always use the app with it. Even though I said
[14:41.400 --> 14:44.800]  I was going to in my review and I really do like brushing my
[14:44.800 --> 14:47.200]  teeth, my phone in my hand, but my phone keeps reminding me
[14:47.200 --> 14:49.600]  that I haven't brushed my teeth in like a month, just like
[14:49.600 --> 14:53.500]  somewhat true. I mean, but as far as your phone is still
[14:53.500 --> 14:55.900]  like, I don't think I told that app that you should be on my
[14:55.900 --> 14:56.500]  lock screen.
[14:57.800 --> 15:00.500]  I recommend you brush your teeth at least I would say at least
[15:00.500 --> 15:04.700]  once before the wedding, use the brush your teeth. I mean, at
[15:04.700 --> 15:08.900]  least once before the Apple event. Let's let's set priorities
[15:08.900 --> 15:09.100]  here.
[15:11.600 --> 15:14.100]  I'm going to take a break here and tell everybody about our
[15:14.100 --> 15:20.500]  first sponsor, Linda dot com, L Y N D A dot com. What's
[15:20.500 --> 15:24.180]  Linda dot com? It's an easy and affordable way to help
[15:24.180 --> 15:30.700]  individuals, teams, whole organizations learn. They have high
[15:30.700 --> 15:35.100]  quality professional content videos that you can instantly
[15:35.100 --> 15:39.500]  stream thousands of courses, each of them created by experts
[15:39.500 --> 15:44.220]  on software, web development, photography, graphic design, you
[15:44.220 --> 15:47.100]  name it. If it's a creative field, they've got content to
[15:47.100 --> 15:52.260]  help you learn it. Here's how Linda dot com stands out from the
[15:52.260 --> 15:56.500]  crowd. They have fresh content. They're constantly almost on a
[15:56.500 --> 16:02.200]  daily basis. If not even on a daily basis, adding new courses,
[16:02.500 --> 16:05.820]  they work directly with industry experts and software
[16:05.820 --> 16:10.620]  developers to provide timely training. Often they have new
[16:10.700 --> 16:14.580]  updated material, the same day that major new versions of apps
[16:15.220 --> 16:18.700]  hit the market. So a new version of Adobe Lightroom hits
[16:18.860 --> 16:22.540]  guess what Linda dot com probably already has new content
[16:22.540 --> 16:26.620]  already ready to go right there on day one because the their
[16:26.620 --> 16:30.220]  experts have been following along with the beta releases. High
[16:30.220 --> 16:34.540]  quality stuff. This is a high quality video. High quality
[16:34.540 --> 16:40.060]  teachers presentations. Right. There's nothing like like the
[16:40.060 --> 16:43.060]  sort of homemade stuff that you see on YouTube courses are
[16:43.060 --> 16:46.620]  broken down in the bite size pieces so you can learn at your own
[16:46.620 --> 16:53.020]  pace and learn from start to finish on your own. Tools include
[16:53.060 --> 16:56.860]  stuff you get from Linda dot com include searchable transcripts.
[16:56.940 --> 17:00.220]  You can make playlists. You can get certificates of course
[17:00.220 --> 17:02.940]  completion, which you can publish to something like your LinkedIn
[17:02.940 --> 17:07.900]  profile. If you use LinkedIn as sort of your online resume, you
[17:07.900 --> 17:10.700]  can just show to people. Hey, look, here's the stuff that I've
[17:10.700 --> 17:14.940]  learned from Linda dot com. They have content from beginner to
[17:14.940 --> 17:18.860]  advanced all experience levels in all these different fields. And
[17:18.860 --> 17:23.060]  even at mobile apps, the mobile apps for iPhone, iPad, Android,
[17:24.900 --> 17:27.300]  let you learn wherever you are. You don't have to be at a
[17:27.300 --> 17:30.660]  computer to do it to use it. How much does it cost? Here's the
[17:30.660 --> 17:35.020]  other regular price is one low monthly fee, 25 bucks a month. And
[17:35.020 --> 17:39.380]  that gives you unlimited access to all of their video tutorials
[17:39.380 --> 17:42.580]  over a hundred thousand video tutorials. They also have premium
[17:42.580 --> 17:45.220]  plans. You can upgrade to a premium plan. That's like you
[17:45.220 --> 17:50.100]  pay. I got an annual basis. And you get a lot more. One of the
[17:50.100 --> 17:53.060]  things you get is you get offline access. You can download
[17:53.060 --> 17:57.580]  videos to your iOS and Android devices and watch them offline.
[17:57.580 --> 18:01.460]  Premium plan members also get to download project files and
[18:01.460 --> 18:04.660]  you can practice along with the instructor. So where do you go to
[18:04.660 --> 18:09.700]  find out more? Go to lynda.com, Linda with a Y slash the talk
[18:09.700 --> 18:12.500]  show. And here's what you get with you. If you use that code, you

[18:27.700 --> 18:32.580]  lynda.com for their continuing support of the show. All right,
[18:32.580 --> 18:38.140]  we're back. One of your recent pieces, I've probably the most
[18:38.140 --> 18:42.420]  recent I think was your review of the, I'm going to get the
[18:42.420 --> 18:47.420]  name wrong, the HTC one something something windows phone.
[18:47.420 --> 18:52.180]  You can do it. You can do it. It's the H, so here it's the HTC
[18:52.180 --> 19:01.700]  one parentheses M a close parentheses for windows. It's not with
[19:01.700 --> 19:06.540]  windows phone and it's not with windows phone 8.1. It is for
[19:06.540 --> 19:12.220]  windows for windows. So yes, the review did not include a review of
[19:12.220 --> 19:15.500]  the phone name as somebody, I think Renee Richie tweeted that to
[19:15.500 --> 19:20.700]  me, but it should have the gist of it is it's pretty much the
[19:20.700 --> 19:26.380]  exact same hardware as the HTC one M8 that we know from
[19:26.380 --> 19:29.660]  Android, except it's running windows phone. It's got the same size
[19:29.660 --> 19:32.700]  right. I'm looking at both of them right now. Right. And it has
[19:32.700 --> 19:36.060]  the same gimmicky well, not I shouldn't say gimmicky. It has the
[19:36.060 --> 19:40.340]  same trick with the camera where there's two cameras, one that's
[19:40.340 --> 19:43.460]  like the really the what are they called ultra pixels, the one
[19:43.460 --> 19:47.580]  that takes the main picture. And the second one that's used for
[19:47.580 --> 19:51.700]  some kind of trickery about changing the focal point, focal
[19:51.700 --> 19:56.020]  distance after you've snapped the photo. Exactly, exactly. It's
[19:56.020 --> 19:59.260]  like the depth of it collects depth information and then it's
[19:59.260 --> 20:02.900]  sort of layers it. And so you can refocus, which it doesn't
[20:02.900 --> 20:07.420]  really work all that well. But yes, exactly carbon copy of the
[20:07.420 --> 20:11.980]  Android version just running different software. All right. I saw
[20:11.980 --> 20:15.700]  you had a little back and forth with Twitter on Twitter with
[20:15.700 --> 20:21.220]  somebody from from HTC about that it was a great review, but
[20:21.220 --> 20:25.460]  the headline because the headline is what was the headline?
[20:26.180 --> 20:28.980]  Another great phone, another great phone you probably won't
[20:28.980 --> 20:34.180]  buy. Yep. Yep. Which is interesting. Yeah. I mean, and that's
[20:34.180 --> 20:36.580]  not because of the hardware. I you know, I actually said around
[20:36.580 --> 20:41.540]  I'm pretty much similar thing about the first HTC one, the M8
[20:41.540 --> 20:44.140]  that came out in March because it was the same situation with
[20:44.140 --> 20:47.580]  the HTC one last year. The Android version of the phone was
[20:47.580 --> 20:50.300]  really, really good, but nobody bought it because instead they
[20:50.300 --> 20:53.660]  listened to the marketing that they saw everywhere from Samsung
[20:53.660 --> 20:56.940]  and they bought Galaxy S5's or S4's or S3's, whatever was out
[20:56.940 --> 20:59.500]  at the time. Instead of buying the HTC one. So I think, you
[20:59.500 --> 21:02.860]  know, HTC is sort of always seems to get caught in the middle
[21:02.860 --> 21:05.180]  of these things where it's like they make really good stuff, but
[21:05.180 --> 21:09.260]  nobody really buys them whether it's because of the marketing
[21:09.260 --> 21:11.420]  or whatever. But I think that's actually changed a lot with the
[21:11.420 --> 21:14.300]  recent phone. They had a lot more stock than they had with the
[21:14.300 --> 21:17.420]  original one. They did a better job of marketing it. The
[21:17.420 --> 21:21.020]  reviews are really good. But obviously for this piece, that
[21:21.020 --> 21:25.820]  headline was really about Windows Phone because nobody has
[21:25.820 --> 21:29.420]  Windows Phone. And I'm really sorry to offend anyone who might be
[21:29.420 --> 21:32.140]  listening to this that has a Windows Phone when I say nobody. I
[21:32.140 --> 21:36.300]  don't mean nobody in the world. I mean, really the general
[21:36.300 --> 21:40.300]  public does not have Windows Phone. And for this piece, I don't
[21:40.300 --> 21:43.580]  even know how I sort of came up with the idea. But, you know,
[21:43.580 --> 21:46.940]  I went to Times Square and I wanted to do the video in Times
[21:46.940 --> 21:49.660]  Square. And then, you know, the column kind of turned into
[21:49.660 --> 21:52.780]  the same thing as the video because I sat in Times Square. We
[21:52.780 --> 21:55.580]  shot for about an hour. We took a break. We sat down. And I
[21:55.580 --> 21:58.220]  didn't see one single person with a Windows Phone.
[21:58.220 --> 22:01.740]  And you were stopping people. And I was stopping people. I mean,
[22:01.740 --> 22:04.940]  but I honestly couldn't stop that many people because most
[22:04.940 --> 22:07.740]  people have their phones out. So most people have iPhones or
[22:07.740 --> 22:10.220]  Android phones out because they're taking photos. They're
[22:10.220 --> 22:13.500]  taking selfies. I mean, it's like, you know, it's the best
[22:13.500 --> 22:17.260]  place on Earth and also the worst place on Earth. And so, you
[22:17.260 --> 22:19.100]  know, I really had to kind of find people that weren't holding
[22:19.100 --> 22:20.940]  their iPhones because I didn't want to be like, oh, do you have a
[22:20.940 --> 22:23.180]  Windows Phone when clearly they have an iPhone or they
[22:23.180 --> 22:26.620]  clearly have a Galaxy S5 or actually did see a lot of HGC
[22:26.620 --> 22:29.340]  ones? I thought, you know, all types of phones, but no Windows
[22:29.340 --> 22:33.900]  phones. Interesting. And so, you know, this piece was really
[22:33.900 --> 22:37.820]  about, and I started using the one I have had the one for about a
[22:37.820 --> 22:42.700]  week. I also have had used the Lumia icon since 8.1 came out
[22:42.700 --> 22:45.900]  and, you know, the software is really good. I really like the
[22:45.900 --> 22:48.860]  software. And at this point, there's a lot of features there
[22:48.860 --> 22:51.660]  that, you know, you certainly don't miss, you know, I didn't
[22:51.660 --> 22:54.940]  end up missing my iPhone's email apps or all these types of,
[22:54.940 --> 22:57.740]  you know, basic core apps. But, you know, so it makes you
[22:57.740 --> 22:59.980]  wonder, why don't people have this? And of course, it comes
[22:59.980 --> 23:02.380]  down to the app ecosystem. But it's, you know, to me, I
[23:02.380 --> 23:04.460]  think it's a lot more than that. And I talk about that in the
[23:04.460 --> 23:07.660]  column. I do think it's very, it's complicated. And it's,
[23:07.660 --> 23:13.980]  it's multi-faceted. My market share is not it alone. And,
[23:13.980 --> 23:16.860]  and the one thing, whenever I talk about market share, it, it
[23:16.860 --> 23:20.220]  people accuse me, people who are not like big Apple fans,
[23:20.220 --> 23:25.740]  accuse me of, or, and other people who tended right about
[23:25.740 --> 23:28.140]  stuff from the Apple perspective, of cherry picking the
[23:28.140 --> 23:31.580]  stat that, that app, you know, the only ones that matter are the
[23:31.580 --> 23:35.740]  ones where Apple's ahead. So when, when, if, if iOS isn't
[23:35.740 --> 23:39.500]  leading in market share, then we'll pick profit share. And
[23:39.500 --> 23:42.780]  now profits is all that matters. And if it were the other way
[23:42.780 --> 23:46.860]  around, that if it was, you know, like when the, the iPod's had
[23:46.860 --> 23:49.900]  a market share lead, then market share mattered. And it's not
[23:49.900 --> 23:54.380]  like the mistake that people make is, is if I say market
[23:54.380 --> 23:59.340]  share is not everything. And it's not even the most single
[23:59.340 --> 24:01.980]  most important thing, that doesn't mean that I'm saying
[24:01.980 --> 24:06.300]  market share doesn't matter at all. It does matter, obviously. Um,
[24:06.300 --> 24:10.300]  but it's not the only thing. Agreed. But the big thing, I think
[24:10.300 --> 24:14.300]  the big thing is there's like a minimum viable market share. And,
[24:14.300 --> 24:18.700]  and, you know, if the overall smartphone market is eight,
[24:18.700 --> 24:22.300]  right now somewhere around like 80% Android 12, this is worldwide,
[24:22.300 --> 24:28.540]  80% Android 12% iPhone and 2, 2.5% Windows Phone. 12%
[24:28.540 --> 24:32.460]  isn't as big enough. And there's so many hundreds of millions of
[24:32.460 --> 24:36.780]  people that's, it's a pretty big market. And 2.5 may not just
[24:36.780 --> 24:40.220]  may not be enough. Yeah. And I think, you know, what, right,
[24:40.220 --> 24:43.100]  you're right, this is the global market share. So when you, you
[24:43.100 --> 24:45.660]  also have to factor in, and this was something we're talking
[24:45.660 --> 24:48.300]  about earlier today with, with some people in the office,
[24:48.300 --> 24:53.100]  factoring in the lower end of the market and lower cost areas
[24:53.100 --> 24:56.700]  where you look at, you know, the, they were not looking at the
[24:56.700 --> 24:59.260]  top end of the market. And you're not looking at sort of these
[24:59.260 --> 25:03.020]  Halo flagship devices. And that's where, obviously,
[25:03.020 --> 25:06.380]  Android has captured a large part of the market. And that's a
[25:06.380 --> 25:09.340]  place that Microsoft has also said they've intended to go.
[25:11.340 --> 25:13.820]  And so that, that's certainly a different look at
[25:13.820 --> 25:16.540]  market share than when you look at either, you know, US or
[25:16.540 --> 25:20.300]  you look at sort of country by country. Yeah. I do think
[25:20.300 --> 25:22.860]  there's also, I, I, I've thought about this so much over
[25:22.860 --> 25:25.420]  the years because I, and I feel like every market ends up
[25:25.420 --> 25:27.980]  playing out differently, right? There's some similarities
[25:27.980 --> 25:32.140]  between this and the PC wars of the 90s between Mac and
[25:32.140 --> 25:35.740]  Windows and similarities. But there's so many other factors
[25:35.740 --> 25:39.740]  are different that it's, there's only loose similarities.
[25:39.740 --> 25:42.140]  And, and everything, every market plays out differently.
[25:42.140 --> 25:47.660]  But the one thing that I, I do think holds true in just about
[25:47.660 --> 25:51.980]  every category through the decades is that you somehow have to
[25:51.980 --> 25:55.980]  get early adopters usually have to get early adopters first.
[25:55.980 --> 25:59.740]  You've got to get some enthusiasts on board nerds, right?
[25:59.740 --> 26:03.020]  The people who listen to stuff like this show and, and who,
[26:03.020 --> 26:07.020]  who like to geek out and, and review 29 laptops or something
[26:07.020 --> 26:10.700]  like that, you have to get them first. And that's the one,
[26:10.700 --> 26:14.140]  you know, and iOS clearly has that and had it right from day
[26:14.140 --> 26:16.300]  one when people, you know, those were the people who
[26:16.300 --> 26:19.260]  lined up around the blocks in 2007 to buy it.
[26:19.260 --> 26:23.020]  Android definitely has that, you know, there's, you know, and that's the whole,
[26:23.020 --> 26:26.140]  you know, coke versus Pepsi flame wars that you see in the
[26:26.140 --> 26:29.980]  comments on, on general purpose tech review sites.
[26:29.980 --> 26:33.740]  I think that's step one of the windows from problem is that
[26:33.740 --> 26:38.220]  there aren't any of them, right? And, and I think they're,
[26:38.220 --> 26:43.580]  they are there. I just think they, I think it's still a timing
[26:43.580 --> 26:46.220]  thing, like they might have come along too late.
[26:46.220 --> 26:49.500]  Yeah, right? Because they, they, they, those people are there.
[26:49.500 --> 26:54.780]  I've heard from them today. Um, well, and again, when we say
[26:54.780 --> 26:58.060]  nobody, we don't really mean 0.0. We, right, right.
[26:58.060 --> 27:01.020]  Practically nobody, like effectively you can round down
[27:01.020 --> 27:04.620]  the zero. Yeah, you're right, you're right. Um,
[27:04.620 --> 27:09.580]  I just, I come back to a lot of it being timing. Um,
[27:09.580 --> 27:13.900]  and I think, you know, and Microsoft admits that it was timing,
[27:13.900 --> 27:16.700]  right? Um, and you know, they'll say, well, we actually were,
[27:16.700 --> 27:19.740]  we were had windows full in the idea, but then, you know,
[27:19.740 --> 27:23.900]  Android came out and stole a lot of the, the market and partners
[27:23.900 --> 27:27.340]  and et cetera. And I think, you know, part of that is,
[27:27.340 --> 27:30.940]  that by now, when we're looking at this five years or six years
[27:30.940 --> 27:34.940]  deep into this smartphone market, now finally, Microsoft is good
[27:34.940 --> 27:39.100]  enough on the platform level to be in line with the
[27:39.100 --> 27:42.860]  competition. And at this point, what does that matter?
[27:42.860 --> 27:47.100]  Right? It's not necessarily pushing ahead the smartphone
[27:47.100 --> 27:50.300]  in some radical way that I'm going to say to someone,
[27:50.300 --> 27:55.580]  no, you've got to get this phone. Right. And, you know, frankly, like,
[27:55.580 --> 27:57.900]  you know, even, I think we're starting to see with iOS and Android,
[27:57.900 --> 28:00.060]  as we see these updates coming in the next couple months,
[28:00.060 --> 28:03.660]  like there's so much feature parity, right? There's so many things
[28:03.660 --> 28:05.500]  that you can get now and one or the other,
[28:05.500 --> 28:08.460]  whether it's different keyboards or it's different notification
[28:08.460 --> 28:11.740]  customization and all of these sorts of things that, you know,
[28:11.740 --> 28:15.260]  people will argue, hold, I wonder where they got that idea from.
[28:15.260 --> 28:19.100]  You know, we're getting to that point where it's so,
[28:19.100 --> 28:22.940]  it is so relying on the apps that we have, but there's still nothing
[28:22.940 --> 28:27.020]  that has pushed smartphones so far ahead into the future. And I'm not even sure
[28:27.020 --> 28:30.300]  I can't even imagine like, I don't look at my phone and say, I mean, I look at my
[28:30.300 --> 28:33.260]  phone and say, these are the things I would want, but they're not necessarily
[28:33.260 --> 28:37.820]  radical ideas. Yeah, it's just refinement, refinement, refinement,
[28:37.820 --> 28:41.900]  you know, it's like, it's like, it's like, refinement and, and there are basic things,
[28:41.900 --> 28:45.980]  but I don't think even for basic things, I would, I would switch
[28:45.980 --> 28:49.340]  to a different platform if it didn't offer everything and more.
[28:49.340 --> 28:55.900]  Yeah. Yeah, somebody else pointed that out like post
[28:55.900 --> 28:59.820]  Google I.O. because Google I.O. was after WWDC this year. But you look at the
[28:59.820 --> 29:03.100]  checklist and there's, you know, there's 10 or 15 things
[29:03.100 --> 29:09.340]  that you could see starting around 2011 or so that these platforms needed to do,
[29:09.340 --> 29:13.660]  to get, to do more of the stuff that it was out. Everybody wanted it,
[29:13.660 --> 29:19.100]  you know, better notifications and on iOS, people wanted, you know,
[29:19.100 --> 29:22.300]  third-party keyboards and stuff like that. And you could just see that the two
[29:22.300 --> 29:25.740]  companies, you know, Google and Apple, they just had a different
[29:25.740 --> 29:29.740]  order, different priorities of which ones they were going to do first.
[29:29.740 --> 29:33.820]  And eventually they just, you know, they both checked off all of them.
[29:33.820 --> 29:37.900]  And some of them, you know, were first on Android and some were first on iOS.
[29:37.900 --> 29:40.860]  And we're getting to the point this year where they've sort of gotten to the
[29:40.860 --> 29:44.220]  bottom of that list. Not that there's nowhere for these
[29:44.220 --> 29:48.540]  things to improve, but all the big obvious ones from about four or five
[29:48.540 --> 29:51.980]  years ago, they've gotten to. Right. Right. And then, you know,
[29:51.980 --> 29:55.340]  that's one of the lines that in this, in this piece was like, you know,
[29:55.340 --> 29:58.540]  switching to Windows Phone at this point is like, just getting
[29:58.540 --> 30:01.740]  a comfortable home, you're same comfortable home in one that
[30:01.740 --> 30:04.860]  right across the street. That's basically the same thing. There's no real
[30:04.860 --> 30:07.740]  reason to switch at this point. Plus, you're not getting all those
[30:07.740 --> 30:11.900]  extras if those are important to you. If those brand new apps, if those
[30:11.900 --> 30:14.780]  updates to your apps are extremely important to you,
[30:14.780 --> 30:18.060]  there's, there's no real reason to leave where you've been so comfortable.
[30:18.060 --> 30:21.500]  Yeah. And I think if you're an enthusiast and you're kind of, you know,
[30:21.500 --> 30:23.820]  the sort of person who likes to get new apps and stuff, you know,
[30:23.820 --> 30:26.300]  follows new new companies and stuff like that,
[30:26.300 --> 30:30.620]  Windows Phone has all that stuff. You know, like, you, you pointed out
[30:30.620 --> 30:33.980]  Instagram, which is a great example where, where Instagram was iOS
[30:33.980 --> 30:37.260]  only famously for first couple of years. And then, and then the
[30:37.260 --> 30:41.180]  Android version came out and, you know, it was huge. And then it,
[30:41.180 --> 30:44.220]  you know, fueled the billion dollar acquisition by Facebook.
[30:44.220 --> 30:47.500]  And eventually, there, now there is a Windows Phone version of it,
[30:47.500 --> 30:52.300]  but it was way after even the Android version. And even now,
[30:52.300 --> 30:57.180]  it still lags because they've added these new, the latest version of Instagram
[30:57.180 --> 31:00.380]  has a bunch of new editing features that aren't in the Windows
[31:00.380 --> 31:04.220]  Phone version. Right. Right. And that's, you see that across apps,
[31:04.220 --> 31:08.700]  like my audio app, I spent like 10 minutes in the car trying to find my top
[31:08.700 --> 31:12.860]  where I usually go to find, you know, pop music. And I could not find the
[31:12.860 --> 31:16.380]  playlist in the Windows Phone app. And I'm pretty sure it's not there,
[31:16.380 --> 31:19.740]  but I gave up. And I think you said that there's, there's still not a
[31:19.740 --> 31:23.820]  lift app for Windows Phone. Yeah, all of those.
[31:23.820 --> 31:27.820]  And I know what he called it was, was late on Windows Phone. Uber,
[31:27.820 --> 31:31.900]  you know, was, and, and if you're the sort of person who wants to use stuff
[31:31.900 --> 31:34.620]  like that, like you've heard about Uber, you're traveling, you know,
[31:34.620 --> 31:38.940]  you're in San Francisco on vacation or business or something like that.
[31:38.940 --> 31:43.020]  And everybody else is using Uber. And you can't, because you're using
[31:43.020 --> 31:48.140]  Windows Phone, it's like, it's just a steady drip drop of annoyances
[31:48.140 --> 31:51.260]  of knowing that you're always going to be the last to get stuff like this.
[31:51.260 --> 31:55.420]  And, you know, circa, what is it now? It's late,
[31:55.420 --> 31:59.900]  second half of 2014. By 2015, I'm sure there will be a lift app.
[31:59.900 --> 32:02.060]  But then there's going to be something else that's new,
[32:02.060 --> 32:07.020]  that's only on iOS, it's only on Android. Totally. And that, and that's the number one
[32:07.020 --> 32:10.460]  reservation I have about the platform. But, you know, the funny thing is that I
[32:10.460 --> 32:13.740]  think maybe two years ago, we would have said, well, this is an okay platform.
[32:13.740 --> 32:18.780]  This is an okay phone, regardless for people who have not had a smartphone yet.
[32:18.780 --> 32:23.020]  It's a beginner phone. But I think we're at this point, we're in the market where
[32:23.020 --> 32:26.300]  already those people have a phone, and they probably have an iPhone,
[32:26.300 --> 32:29.420]  or they probably have a basic Android phone. And at those,
[32:29.420 --> 32:33.740]  this point, those people don't want to switch. So that's where I think so much of this was a
[32:33.740 --> 32:38.460]  timing game. And, you know, it's unfortunate for Microsoft. I mean,
[32:38.460 --> 32:41.340]  I'm not going to sit here crying for them. But it's unfortunate that they got,
[32:41.340 --> 32:45.980]  to get, got together a really good operating system so late in the game. Because there are a
[32:45.980 --> 32:49.820]  lot of things here that I actually really like now. And yes, some of them are, you know, the same
[32:49.820 --> 32:54.380]  as you'd get on others. But, you know, Cortana's a really nice blend of Siri and Google now.
[32:54.380 --> 32:59.500]  I like a lot of, I like a lot of features that they built into Cortana. I like a lot of things
[32:59.500 --> 33:03.740]  that when it comes to the customizations and the notifications and all the base, you know,
[33:03.740 --> 33:07.660]  base OS stuff, it's just, you know, how much time are you usually spending in that stuff?
[33:07.660 --> 33:12.940]  Now, the thing I noticed when I last spent some time with Windows phones was when I was at the
[33:12.940 --> 33:21.180]  build conference back in May is, and Windows phone was always better to me than Android in this
[33:21.180 --> 33:25.500]  regard. But the latest, I don't think we had eight one yet. Maybe I forget the version number,
[33:25.500 --> 33:29.740]  but we were playing with phones. I had it as yet on release version of it. So maybe it was like
[33:29.740 --> 33:36.060]  an early version of eight one. But the little animations like stretching when you get to the bottom
[33:36.060 --> 33:41.980]  of a list and the bouncing and stuff like that is so much nicer than stock Android.
[33:41.980 --> 33:45.900]  It's, it's really good. And the frame rates, I mean, just frame rates across the board,
[33:45.900 --> 33:52.220]  it's really, really snappy UI. And it's something that Microsoft has been good at for a long time.
[33:52.220 --> 33:56.540]  But it really shows. Yeah. Yeah. And I like the keyboard too. I mean,
[33:56.540 --> 34:00.780]  yeah, I will say that one thing whenever I try switching to an Android phone, and this isn't
[34:00.780 --> 34:06.140]  better or worse, is it just habit, but I find myself really struggling to type because I find the
[34:06.140 --> 34:13.260]  Android keyboard, at least the default one to be so different. Whereas Windows phone, my iOS typing
[34:13.260 --> 34:16.780]  habits, I just instantly was typing as well as I do on an iPhone.
[34:16.780 --> 34:21.660]  It's funny. You know, I, we, I think we talked about this the last time I was on my keyboard
[34:21.660 --> 34:29.260]  situation. I have, I have serious keyboard problems. And I made the switch to the iPhone keyboard
[34:29.260 --> 34:34.860]  after using Android physical, cordy keyboard on an Android phone for, for three or four years.
[34:34.860 --> 34:40.220]  And now I'm great on the iPhone. And now when I go back to my Moto X Android phone,
[34:40.220 --> 34:44.140]  I'm really bad. So I've been using Swift key, which is better. I'm actually really excited.
[34:44.140 --> 34:52.060]  I'm hoping Swift key builds a app for iOS 8. But I still, I still don't think I found the
[34:52.060 --> 34:56.940]  perfect software keyboard. That said, I'm, I'm just going to go get that new blackberry.
[34:56.940 --> 35:00.060]  That's in the shape of a square. And I think that'll solve all my problems.
[35:02.220 --> 35:05.740]  Let's hold off on that. Thank God. That's not being released during my wedding weekend.
[35:05.740 --> 35:11.420]  Thank God. Let me take a few moments here and tell everybody about our good friends at Warby
[35:11.420 --> 35:16.940]  Parker, Warby Parker provides boutique quality classically crafted eyewear
[35:16.940 --> 35:23.820]  revolutionary price points. The company was conceived as an alternative to the overpriced eyewear
[35:23.820 --> 35:29.100]  that's available today, prescription eyewear simply should not cost three, four, five hundred
[35:29.100 --> 35:35.900]  dollars. And, and the whole company is founded on the, on the idea why, why do glasses cost so
[35:35.900 --> 35:40.220]  much? Do they have to? And the answer is no. It ends up that the industry is mostly is controlled
[35:40.220 --> 35:45.180]  largely by a few large companies that have kept prices artificially high, reaping huge profits
[35:45.180 --> 35:53.260]  from customers who have no other options. So Warby Parker came into this market a few years ago
[35:53.260 --> 35:57.420]  and, and they've turned it upside down, really popular, more popular than ever before.
[35:58.380 --> 36:03.980]  What are the, what are the main points? Here's the thing. Number one, eyeglasses should not
[36:03.980 --> 36:10.540]  cost as much as an iPhone. Their prescription glasses start at just 95 bucks, including prescription
[36:10.540 --> 36:17.340]  lenses. They have a titanium collection with metal frames that starts at 145 bucks, also with the
[36:17.340 --> 36:26.460]  prescription lens. They use premium Japanese titanium, French non rocking screws, all glasses include
[36:26.460 --> 36:30.620]  anti reflective and anti glare coating. There's no additional cost because who doesn't want that
[36:30.620 --> 36:36.300]  everybody wants that? Of course you want that. All glasses include a hard case and a cleaning cloth,
[36:36.300 --> 36:41.580]  really nice case. We've got a couple of them here in the house. Really, really nice case. It's
[36:41.580 --> 36:48.220]  all high quality. The price is way lower, but you get a really, really quality set of eyeglasses.
[36:48.220 --> 36:53.900]  And they make buying glasses online easy and risk free. They have a home try on program. So you
[36:53.900 --> 36:57.980]  go online, you look at their website, find the frames you're interested in. They have some cool
[36:57.980 --> 37:02.300]  features on the website. You can use a webcam, get your picture up there, just get a basic idea of
[37:02.300 --> 37:07.660]  what the frames look like on your face. But then you pick five pairs and they just ship them to you.
[37:07.660 --> 37:10.620]  Now they don't have your prescription lenses in them yet. It's like trying them on in the store,
[37:10.620 --> 37:15.260]  but they've send five to you. You can try them on and home, get your feedback from your friends
[37:15.260 --> 37:20.940]  and family, see what people like. And you can keep them for five days before you send them back,
[37:20.940 --> 37:25.900]  get sleep on it. Look at them for a couple of days. Then you send them back. You tell them which one
[37:25.900 --> 37:32.940]  you want, if any. And when you place your order for prescription glasses, they'll get started on
[37:32.940 --> 37:38.860]  right away and you'll have them in your hands within 10 business days. In my experience, our
[37:38.860 --> 37:45.740]  experience here usually lasts. So here's another great feature about Warby. Got to mention it.
[37:45.740 --> 37:52.300]  For every pair of glasses, they sell. They distribute another pair of prescription glasses to
[37:52.300 --> 37:57.900]  someone in need around the world. For a lot of people around the world, access to prescription
[37:57.900 --> 38:03.900]  glasses is just out of reach. And Warby Parker is doing great work on a one for one basis with the
[38:03.900 --> 38:12.860]  glasses they sell to help turn that around. So where do you go to find out more? You need
[38:12.860 --> 38:26.700]  eyeglasses. Here's what you do. Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show. And you'll get your
[38:26.700 --> 38:34.700]  five try on frames. And by using that URL slash the talk show, you get three three day shipping
[38:34.700 --> 38:39.900]  on your order. Send the frames back. Choose your favorite pairs. Warby makes it completely risk free
[38:41.020 --> 38:45.580]  with that free shipping three days. So my thanks to Warby Parker and go check them out if you need
[38:45.580 --> 38:51.420]  new glasses. What's this? I did I was kind of hoping that would be out by now that we were talking
[38:51.420 --> 38:59.260]  about the the square blackberry. I know. As soon as I saw it, as soon as I saw it, my first thought
[38:59.260 --> 39:04.060]  was that's interesting. And my second thought was, oh, I can't wait to talk to Joanna about that.
[39:04.860 --> 39:09.580]  But you think maybe maybe you're over physical keyboards now, maybe your habits have finally
[39:09.580 --> 39:17.340]  switched. I mean, they had they had to, right? We have to adapt. So I had to adapt. And I'm really
[39:17.340 --> 39:23.580]  fast on my iPhone now. I'm actually really fast on Swift key to if the phone can not be so slow.
[39:23.580 --> 39:30.380]  My my the my Moto X is really slow now. But I'm really fast on my iPhone. And I'm excited about
[39:30.380 --> 39:36.780]  the iPhones predictive tech stuff with iOS 8 as well. So I mean, I can't say that I haven't done
[39:36.780 --> 39:46.060]  a typing test me versus myself on the iPhone versus an old blackberry. But that's a good idea.
[39:46.060 --> 39:53.100]  Yeah, but I there's certain parts of user interface design where it's almost more important or
[39:53.100 --> 39:57.820]  not even almost, but it is more important how fast you think you are versus how fast you really
[39:57.820 --> 40:02.300]  are. And if you feel like you're fast enough on the iPhone, that's really all that matters.
[40:02.300 --> 40:07.660]  Even if you found out that like on a stopwatch, you're still not as fast as you were on blackberry.
[40:07.660 --> 40:13.340]  Right. So a famous example of this is I might botch some of the details, but this is like a
[40:13.340 --> 40:20.940]  really old Apple story like from the 80s. And I think I got the story from Bruce talk. Well,
[40:20.940 --> 40:26.220]  I'll just call him talk. Everybody knows talk, but a human interface design guru used to be at Apple
[40:26.220 --> 40:35.260]  and now he's at the Neiman whatever group. An Apple used to use to test an awful lot of stuff
[40:35.260 --> 40:44.140]  in like with cameras and a behind glass and just test real people doing stuff. And what they found
[40:44.140 --> 40:49.900]  out is that people were way faster like let's say they wanted a print. They'd say they're making
[40:49.900 --> 40:55.820]  a new document in Mac right and then go and print it. And when they would tell some of the people
[40:55.820 --> 41:01.260]  to use the mouse and go up to file, pull it down, go down to print and tell other people to use the
[41:01.260 --> 41:08.380]  keyboard shortcuts. And they found that the mouse was using the mouse to go up to file print was
[41:08.380 --> 41:15.900]  faster than using the command P to print or file save in with the mouse was faster than command
[41:15.900 --> 41:22.780]  S. But then when they asked the users, which was faster, it was like almost unanimous that they
[41:22.780 --> 41:27.820]  said using the keyboard shortcut was faster. Because when they first had the research that said,
[41:27.820 --> 41:33.260]  hey, it's always faster to use the menu. They thought about getting rid of all the keyboard shortcuts
[41:33.260 --> 41:36.860]  and saying forget all these keyboard shortcuts will just make the user use the mouse all the time
[41:36.860 --> 41:42.700]  because it's faster. But it felt slower. And the best that they could figure it out is that
[41:42.700 --> 41:47.420]  when you when you use a keyboard shortcut, it's like two parts of your brain at once. There's
[41:47.420 --> 41:53.500]  the first part where you have to remember the what it is. Like you know you want to save this
[41:53.500 --> 42:00.540]  document and then your brain pauses and goes, all right, it's command S. Use your use your left thumb,
[42:00.540 --> 42:05.580]  put it on the command key and then you hit the S. And then you do it. This isn't true now though.
[42:05.580 --> 42:10.380]  No, well, it might be different now because people are so used to computers who knows. But the
[42:10.380 --> 42:15.980]  point is though that it ends up that people don't remember the time they spend remembering
[42:16.540 --> 42:21.740]  the keystroke. It's like that didn't happen. And so the only part that they feel like they remember
[42:21.740 --> 42:26.940]  is the actual using their fingers. There's like a blank spot there where you don't remember it.
[42:26.940 --> 42:32.060]  I think it might be for a lot of people. Maybe for power users. It's not true. It's definitely not
[42:32.060 --> 42:38.060]  the case for me. I mean, right. But I think for typical people it might be. But they still feel better.
[42:38.060 --> 42:44.940]  I guess that's the difference between learned, yeah, learned and whatever. What's the
[42:44.940 --> 42:53.180]  alert action and what becomes habit? Yeah. That's not the right word. But you know what I'm saying.
[42:53.180 --> 42:57.500]  Yeah, but command S is maybe a bad example because for a lot of us, we don't even think about it.
[42:57.500 --> 43:03.340]  Like my friend Michael Lop, the ranser and post guy. When he's writing, he just, he writes a sentence
[43:03.340 --> 43:06.620]  and then when he's thinking about what to write next, his fingers just do command S.
[43:07.900 --> 43:11.340]  Because like, you know, in the old days when computer crashes would just bring down your whole
[43:11.340 --> 43:17.020]  computer, you know, you were always one one crash away from losing what you've written.
[43:17.020 --> 43:21.580]  So there's an, I have that habit. I have that habit, but now that I work so much in
[43:21.580 --> 43:26.060]  Google Docs, I guess I've kind of killed that habit. It's, to me, it's an important thing
[43:26.060 --> 43:31.100]  like on a Mac, any Mac app, even if it's not like a file based app, if it's like some kind of
[43:31.100 --> 43:36.700]  thing where you just, it's like a library, you know, type thing. You should at least,
[43:36.700 --> 43:41.180]  even if command S doesn't do anything, don't beep or anything like that when you hit command S.
[43:41.180 --> 43:46.460]  Even if it isn't necessary, if everything you type gets saved automatically, let me hit command
[43:46.460 --> 43:52.140]  S anyway, because I feel better. Interesting. But that's, I don't think I even do it when I,
[43:52.140 --> 43:56.540]  we're going to go into Google Docs now. Yeah, I have a horrible command. But Michael Lops is like
[43:56.540 --> 44:03.100]  pathological. Michael up does command S probably like 30 times a minute. He's just type, type,
[44:03.100 --> 44:11.740]  type, type, type command S. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to have to do a typing test. I'm going to
[44:11.740 --> 44:15.660]  have to do a typing test when this, when this new BlackBerry comes out, though, who knows when
[44:15.660 --> 44:20.140]  that's happening. I do think it's a shame. This is another one of the things where it's like,
[44:20.140 --> 44:25.020]  maybe too late, but it's like, man, if only BlackBerry had come out with a phone in that form factor
[44:25.020 --> 44:31.180]  a couple of years ago, doesn't it, it's somewhere that was decent? Yeah, I mean, that's the big if.
[44:31.180 --> 44:36.620]  Yeah. But boy, form factor wise, it really looks to me like, hey, here's somebody who's not just
[44:36.620 --> 44:44.060]  trying to copy the 2007 iPhone. Right. But what I mean, and I know they've made some arguments
[44:44.060 --> 44:48.620]  that the square shape and their aspect ratio of the screen is better for like, I think it's
[44:48.620 --> 44:54.860]  Excel documents. Yeah, really. Yeah, really. That's where you're, I mean, it's right on marketing
[44:54.860 --> 45:01.500]  message for them, I guess. Um, better for Instagram. Right. That's a good point. It's a, it's a,
[45:02.220 --> 45:08.140]  it's exact square shape for an Instagram. Yeah. Sure. The camera's going to suck. Yeah, probably.
[45:08.140 --> 45:12.860]  Well, maybe I won't. I do feel like that part of the part of the irony of Instagram lagging on
[45:12.860 --> 45:18.060]  Windows phone is that Windows phone as a platform is known for having good cameras. Great cameras.
[45:18.060 --> 45:23.260]  Yeah. Like just platform wide. I mean, that's actually one of the things that's hard about this
[45:23.260 --> 45:29.500]  HTC is that you can get way better cameras on the Lumias. But I prefer the design of this HTC to
[45:29.500 --> 45:36.620]  the, the Lumia, you know, the Lumia design. Yeah. Yeah. HTC is interesting. You know, I know we're
[45:36.620 --> 45:40.700]  a little all over the map here, but HTC is an interesting company because I've said this for years
[45:40.700 --> 45:48.220]  and it sort of is, it just goes to show how, how again, you can say, I say design is very important,
[45:48.220 --> 45:52.700]  but it's not, it doesn't mean everything. Right. And there's the HTC is a great example of a company
[45:52.700 --> 45:58.780]  who I think has every year, year after year has produced better design phones than Samsung.
[45:58.780 --> 46:05.100]  Oh, yeah. And just got just gotten annihilated in the market from the start from, from the start of
[46:05.100 --> 46:09.420]  even, even if you think about when those, both of those companies were making the original Windows
[46:09.420 --> 46:17.340]  phones, you know, when you think about what was it? Was it them? What was that HTC with the slider?
[46:17.340 --> 46:24.380]  Oh, that was a really good phone. The diamond, no, it wasn't the diamond. It was in that same
[46:24.380 --> 46:33.580]  family. Yeah. Well, the thing I remember, and this, this goes back to that, that the, the sort of
[46:33.580 --> 46:39.900]  transition years when the iPhone had the modern smartphone market to itself because Android
[46:39.900 --> 46:48.780]  wasn't out yet, and Microsoft was still on Windows mobile, you know, 2007, 2008, 2009, um, HCC tilt.
[46:48.780 --> 46:56.460]  Yeah, HCC tilt. HTC back then was the world's phone. They were by far and away the number one
[46:57.740 --> 47:01.260]  Windows mobile hands maker. Yeah, that's what I was talking about. I didn't mean Windows
[47:01.260 --> 47:06.860]  when Windows mobile. Right, but they were to Windows mobile, what like Samsung is to, to Android.
[47:06.860 --> 47:11.660]  Absolutely, because they made these types of phones. They made the good keyboard at a stylus that
[47:11.660 --> 47:20.700]  came out the, um, what was the other one after the tilt? I'm losing my, my memory was the, the,
[47:20.700 --> 47:26.700]  the arrive was the Windows phone, whatever. They made great keyboards on these.
[47:27.500 --> 47:33.820]  Yeah. I think it's basically what I'm getting at here is that I really want HCC to make
[47:33.820 --> 47:41.020]  an old slide out keyboard phone with Windows phone with apps that I want to use.
[47:42.860 --> 47:48.540]  And I'll be happy. I do think there's, and you know, they've used better materials in Samsung.
[47:48.540 --> 47:53.900]  I mean, it's just, you know, the, the, there's to some degree. I mean, it's not the most important
[47:53.900 --> 48:00.220]  thing. I mean, it's, it's, it's not logical, I guess, to say how good does the phone look when
[48:00.220 --> 48:04.220]  it's not even on before you even know which operating system it is. But for something you carry
[48:04.220 --> 48:07.580]  about with you all day and that you do hold in your hand all the time, it matters, I think,
[48:07.580 --> 48:12.700]  you know, does it feel good in your hand? And HCC's phones feel way better than Samsung's.
[48:12.700 --> 48:17.660]  Oh, yeah, Samsung's are, I mean, I know now like last week they announced this one that has a little
[48:17.660 --> 48:22.780]  bit of metal on it. Yeah, just the frame, just the, um, it's almost like they're, they're like
[48:22.780 --> 48:27.900]  four years behind the, they're sort of like the iPhone 4S and 4, you know, with the metal
[48:27.900 --> 48:34.860]  outside, but the back is still plastic. Yeah, I mean, it's Samsung phones feel like
[48:36.220 --> 48:41.180]  even reviews, I cuz I read all the, you know, the reviews of these things. I don't necessarily
[48:41.180 --> 48:45.900]  link to all of them, but even from people who are big fans and, you know, like a really glowing
[48:45.900 --> 48:51.900]  review of like a new galaxy phone, it inevitably mentions, you know, kind of a cheap build quality
[48:51.900 --> 48:59.500]  feel to it. I, I don't, I haven't really read glowing reviews of the Samsung phone. Not recently,
[48:59.500 --> 49:07.740]  not recently, but I mean, it is, it, it was baffling to me how many more people, I mean, even
[49:07.740 --> 49:15.740]  appreciated the galaxy S4's design over the HCC one about two years ago, that people even,
[49:15.740 --> 49:20.140]  even when at all things that other things were equal, people are recommending the Samsung over
[49:20.140 --> 49:25.980]  the HCC. Um, and part of that was marketing, part of that might have been some of these software
[49:25.980 --> 49:30.940]  features that no one ever figured out how to use and now they're not even in the phone. Um, but
[49:30.940 --> 49:37.340]  yeah, I mean, Samsung's biggest problem to me at this point isn't hardware design. It is 100%
[49:37.340 --> 49:43.580]  software design. Um, that galaxy tab S is a really nice piece of hardware. If you can look aside,
[49:43.580 --> 49:52.140]  the, the plastic backing, the software is just a nightmare. That's the one that has two sizes.
[49:52.140 --> 49:58.060]  Yeah, two sizes exactly going head to head with the iPad mini retina and with the, with the air.
[49:58.060 --> 50:03.020]  All right, but they still still have that build quality stuff. Remember the one and it had
[50:03.020 --> 50:07.260]  done. It's really, it's thin. I mean, you know, when you look at, when you look at how thin it is and
[50:07.260 --> 50:11.900]  you think, okay, well, they had to do maybe some of this plastic tooling on the back and to make it a
[50:11.900 --> 50:18.220]  little bit lighter, that doesn't bother me as much as, as, as the software. I think part of it too,
[50:18.220 --> 50:24.140]  I do think part of it is a, it's an institutional lack of taste because even like materials
[50:24.140 --> 50:28.780]  aside, even if you say cost wise, we've got to build this out of plastic. Um, they've done things
[50:28.780 --> 50:33.020]  where they've made the, the back look like fake leather and they even have like fake stitching.
[50:33.020 --> 50:37.740]  Right. It's just tacky. So tacky. But I think another thing we're not going to discuss the
[50:37.740 --> 50:43.660]  Band-Aid back either again. We're not going there. I think another factor though is that they put
[50:43.660 --> 50:50.220]  out so many things a year, you know, that they don't just concentrate on one or two flagship new
[50:50.220 --> 50:54.940]  devices that I forget how many tablets Samsung has put out in the last calendar year. Somebody
[50:54.940 --> 51:00.220]  when they came out with the Tab S tallied them all up and it's, I did. Yeah. And I don't remember.
[51:00.220 --> 51:04.060]  I think it was like nine, nine or 10. Actually I said to my editor this morning,
[51:04.060 --> 51:09.660]  um, uh, Wilson in case he every wrist really hears this. Um, I said, oh, well, there's this Barnes
[51:09.660 --> 51:14.940]  and Noble event tomorrow and they're releasing the tab, you know, according to the rumors,
[51:14.940 --> 51:19.660]  it seems like they're releasing the tab four with, you know, some Barnes and Noble software and
[51:19.660 --> 51:23.660]  he's like, wait, the tab four, didn't we just review that? And I was like, no, we, we reviewed the
[51:23.660 --> 51:29.580]  tab S. He's like, oh, right, there's a difference. I think that when you, when they put out that many
[51:29.580 --> 51:34.700]  devices here to, you know, if they put out 10 tablets a year, I don't know that they can ever
[51:34.700 --> 51:41.020]  put enough time into getting any one of them up up to the standards that the people who've seen
[51:41.020 --> 51:48.220]  like HTC devices and Apple devices and even Nokia devices expect because it's, it's too scattered.
[51:48.220 --> 51:52.540]  Right. Well, that was the argument they made with this Tab S. They said, you know, this is,
[51:52.540 --> 51:58.460]  this is the flagship tablet, like just like the flagship phone with the Galaxy S5 or whatever,
[51:58.460 --> 52:02.060]  you know, the four, whatever that they do every year. This is the flagship tablet,
[52:03.420 --> 52:08.220]  you know, for these flagship phones, pay a little bit more attention to that. I mean, I, I imagine
[52:08.220 --> 52:13.900]  somewhere deep there, they are really working on these software issues because the reviews are
[52:13.900 --> 52:21.500]  all bashing them for it. Yeah, but it's hard though because that's, you can say we have to get
[52:21.500 --> 52:27.980]  better at software, but doing it is a different thing. And it's, you know, they've never really shown
[52:27.980 --> 52:34.060]  an aptitude for it. Right. And it makes me wonder whether they might not, you know, I don't
[52:34.060 --> 52:38.300]  know that that's what they're thinking, but I would wonder whether they're looking at, you know,
[52:38.300 --> 52:45.340]  some kind of big acquisition to get to bring in software talent that could, you know, just
[52:45.340 --> 52:51.180]  hire, figure out some, but some company that does mobile software well enough and that's sort of
[52:51.180 --> 52:55.580]  scale that they could, you know, have enough people to do it and, and bring in a new team because
[52:55.580 --> 52:59.740]  I don't think the people who are already there to have any, you know, have shown anything that
[52:59.740 --> 53:05.180]  that they're even on a path to getting where they need to be. Right. Or, or, you know, with the
[53:05.180 --> 53:09.980]  improved relations with Google and, and Google what, what they seem to be doing is really cleaning
[53:09.980 --> 53:14.380]  everything up. And I was actually going to write a piece on this a couple of months ago when the LG
[53:14.380 --> 53:20.860]  G3 came out. That phone is really clean now, you know, LG cleaned up their act there and didn't
[53:20.860 --> 53:26.620]  throw on all these types of widgets and these little buzzing things they used to have on their
[53:26.620 --> 53:30.860]  phones. They, they really did a nice job sort of cleaning the interface app. I mean, there's still
[53:30.860 --> 53:35.740]  some of it and you got to go through and delete it all, but for the most part, they've done a
[53:35.740 --> 53:40.380]  good job. And, you know, when you look at some of the other stuff that's been coming out, I mean,
[53:40.380 --> 53:45.820]  the L version of, of Android and a lot of this stuff is looking really clean and polished. You know,
[53:45.820 --> 53:50.780]  there's no reason Samsung couldn't just stick with that. Of course, they want to put their mark on
[53:50.780 --> 53:54.700]  it. But yeah, see, the problem then is that they're not differentiated. There's nothing, you know,
[53:54.700 --> 53:58.940]  they, but maybe they work closer with Google to figure out what that is for them instead of just
[53:58.940 --> 54:04.300]  making these things ugly. All right, somehow get most somehow work out of thing with Google to get
[54:04.300 --> 54:09.260]  most favored handset maker status and, I don't know, get a new version of Android first or something.
[54:09.260 --> 54:14.860]  Right. And maybe, maybe this stuff just bothers us. I have, I see a lot of people and I have
[54:14.860 --> 54:20.140]  friends with, with, with Galaxy phones and they still have the crap just sitting there. They just
[54:20.140 --> 54:24.940]  have those, those S widgets and S health widgets just sitting there on the home screen. It's like,
[54:25.580 --> 54:29.900]  you guys know you can move that, right? It doesn't bother you. Is it like looking at like a really
[54:29.900 --> 54:36.460]  ugly painting on your phone or your wall every day? It baffles me to no end. But it's true that
[54:36.460 --> 54:41.180]  I think probably most people don't even think about stuff like that. They don't see it. And if
[54:41.180 --> 54:45.260]  it registers at any level, it doesn't register at the level where they want to figure out if they
[54:45.260 --> 54:49.900]  can do something. But the problem is, is those aren't good customers because if they don't even
[54:49.900 --> 54:54.300]  care that you gave them crap where on your, this, you know, this year's LG, whatever,
[54:54.940 --> 54:59.260]  two, two years ago, two years from now or three years from now when they get a new phone,
[54:59.260 --> 55:02.460]  they're not going to have any kind of loyalty to that device. They're not going to come in and say,
[55:02.460 --> 55:07.100]  I want the new LG thing. They're just going to say, whatever, you know, if they, if they said,
[55:07.100 --> 55:10.860]  whatever, when you showed them this phone that has all this crap, they're going to go into the
[55:10.860 --> 55:16.220]  Verizon store and say, just give me whatever three years from now. And if it's not a LG, if it's a
[55:16.220 --> 55:22.380]  Samsung now or if it's an HTC, that's why they're, they're all trying to differentiate on software.
[55:22.380 --> 55:25.820]  And, and when you, the irony here is when you think about it, when you take a Windows
[55:25.820 --> 55:29.260]  phone out of the box, you don't, you don't get a cleaner experience. I mean, you do. You get,
[55:29.260 --> 55:35.020]  iOS has a, as a similar clean experience. But like, this is a, it's a really polished experience.
[55:35.020 --> 55:40.060]  There's not a lot of crap anywhere. Even if there is, it's sort of hidden below the, you know,
[55:40.060 --> 55:45.580]  main, main center tiles, it's a really clean experience. And I think an easier one for people
[55:45.580 --> 55:49.500]  out of the box. And I said that in the review this week is that, you know, I would rather teach
[55:49.500 --> 55:54.780]  someone how to use a Windows phone than an Android phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would, I have,
[55:54.780 --> 55:59.180]  everything I've seen, yeah, definitely. It's a lot, it doesn't go with, it doesn't seem like stuff
[55:59.180 --> 56:06.300]  is as nested. Right. Right. It's a lot flatter conceptually, not flat and visual, you know,
[56:06.300 --> 56:11.740]  iOS and all the, not the flat you wide design, but flat in terms of, if you're just going to map
[56:11.740 --> 56:17.580]  it out on a whiteboard, here's the, how to find things. Yeah, here's how to find things. Yeah, it's a
[56:17.580 --> 56:25.340]  lot simpler. Our next sponsor is another long time supporter of the show, our good friends at
[56:25.340 --> 56:29.420]  back place. Now you guys probably heard me talk about back place before unless you're new to the
[56:29.420 --> 56:33.900]  show. And if you are new to the show, what, what, what is wrong with you, you should be, you should
[56:33.900 --> 56:41.020]  have been listening to the show for, for months at the very least, back blaze is online backup
[56:41.580 --> 56:51.100]  unlimited, unthrottle for your Mac, you install the software, everything on your Mac,
[56:51.100 --> 56:54.860]  all of it, everything on your hard drive, everything on an external drive, you have plugged into your
[56:54.860 --> 57:03.180]  Mac, gets backed up online securely to back blaze. They're servers in the cloud. They have over 100
[57:03.180 --> 57:10.700]  petabytes of data backed up. Now I, a couple weeks ago, I asked to clarify this, a petabyte is 1,000
[57:10.700 --> 57:19.260]  terabytes. We're perhaps, you know, cement to be pedantic. It's 1,024 terabytes. So that's the
[57:19.260 --> 57:28.220]  next level up from a terabyte. They have over 100 petabytes of data backed up. Anyone, I guess,
[57:28.220 --> 57:34.460]  can back up your data. But what, what, what about getting it back? Well, back blaze has just crossed
[57:34.460 --> 57:43.500]  the 6 billion files restored mark. In other words, users of back place have restored over 6 billion
[57:43.500 --> 57:49.660]  files from their cloud based servers. You can access your data anywhere. They have an iPhone app,
[57:49.660 --> 57:56.220]  let you access and share any of your files. So while you're on the phone, you can log into back,
[57:56.220 --> 58:02.140]  open back blaze, tap, go there, navigate to any file, and you can email it to somebody. So if
[58:02.140 --> 58:05.740]  you're out and about and somebody says, hey, gaming that file, you know, it's on your Mac, you know,
[58:05.740 --> 58:11.100]  back blazes backed it up. You can get to it right from your phone, email it or whatever you want to do
[58:11.100 --> 58:17.900]  with it right from there. When you do restore, you can restore one file at a time, couple of files,
[58:17.900 --> 58:24.540]  or all your files easily with the web restore. 25% of all back blaze restores are just one file at
[58:24.540 --> 58:29.980]  a time. It's not just for computer disasters. It might just be because you want to access one
[58:29.980 --> 58:35.980]  file when you're on another machine. I always mentioned this, back blaze was founded by former
[58:35.980 --> 58:43.580]  Apple engineers. It runs a native on your Mac and on Mavericks. And here's the thing, the price
[58:43.580 --> 58:49.500]  is just unbelievable. There's no add-ons, no gimmicks, no upsells, no additional charges. It's just
[58:49.500 --> 58:56.060]  five bucks a month per computer for unlimited, unthrottle backup. You will sleep so much better,
[58:56.060 --> 59:01.740]  knowing that everything on your computer is backed up off-site out of your house, out of your office.
[59:03.660 --> 59:10.860]  You just install it and forget it until you need it. Five bucks a month. You can get a risk-free,
[59:10.860 --> 59:16.540]  no credit card required trial. Just go there. Don't give me a credit card. Just download it and
[59:16.540 --> 59:24.380]  try it out. And here's where you go. Go to backblaze.com slash daringfireball. Backblaze.com slash
[59:24.380 --> 59:29.500]  daringfireball. Really encourage everybody. If you haven't done it already, try them out.
[59:30.300 --> 59:35.340]  One of the other pieces I've seen this month, you did a piece on, I think this was probably in the
[59:36.220 --> 59:40.940]  aftermath of your mega. How many laptops did you review? 29?
[59:40.940 --> 59:47.180]  I had about 20 laptops. Windows laptops sitting at my desk.
[59:47.180 --> 59:55.820]  You did a yeoman's work. Here's all 20 laptops of right now today. It's back to school
[59:55.820 --> 1:00:00.700]  season. It's early August. People are a lot of kids are going to be buying getting new laptops.
[1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:05.740]  Here's the summary. We can talk about that in a bit. But in the aftermath of that, you also did
[1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:10.620]  a, hey, enough with the crapware piece and with advice on that. And that's like one of those things
[1:00:10.620 --> 1:00:15.260]  where it's like a long time Mac user. It's like, I can't believe that that's still a thing.
[1:00:15.260 --> 1:00:20.220]  I know. I can't believe it's still a thing. You know, I used to review PCs like one a week,
[1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:25.900]  right? And I just used to be something I like new I would be dealing with. And I guess I just,
[1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:30.220]  I thought maybe when Windows 8 came like, where were they going to put the crapware? Were they
[1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:34.940]  going to put it on the tile screens? Well, they just kept putting it on the tile screens and on the
[1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:43.980]  desktop. But yeah, it's just, you know, nothing. It could be one of the things that makes me,
[1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:49.900]  I don't know if I get more angry at the pop-ups that come up. Like if you're doing something,
[1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:54.620]  like I was writing my column and something and then like three Mac a fee or Norton pop-up ads
[1:00:54.620 --> 1:00:59.340]  come at you and you're like, you know, I already told you I'm not going to reboot the system
[1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:06.060]  or give you my email address right now. Or when you open up the laptop and you have eBay ads on
[1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:13.020]  your desktop, it's like really eBay is like at, why is that the strategy at this point?
[1:01:13.020 --> 1:01:17.980]  Why does eBay even want to be involved in that? Like I understood five years ago why eBay was on
[1:01:17.980 --> 1:01:23.180]  my debt and was doing that, right? But like now really eBay, like let's get with the times,
[1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:29.660]  like real, I just, who is really getting invested in eBay because it's sitting on their desktop?
[1:01:29.660 --> 1:01:33.660]  I've heard it said though that, you know, the reason that such a problem is that whole, that whole
[1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:40.540]  race that the race to the bottom pricing lies in the PC market. And I don't know if it was Ben Thompson
[1:01:41.180 --> 1:01:45.020]  somebody, but I've heard it said before and it makes sense intuitively at some level that
[1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:52.380]  that when you're selling a laptop for $350 or something like that, you're, you're really not making
[1:01:52.380 --> 1:01:56.540]  any money on the hardware at all. And that the only money somebody like Dell makes when they sell
[1:01:56.540 --> 1:02:04.220]  $350 laptop is whatever they get from stuff like McAfee or Norton or whoever else is in those
[1:02:04.220 --> 1:02:09.100]  things. Like the money they get from those deals is really the only money they get period.
[1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:16.140]  But, but I come back to eBay because it's eBay is fault for keeping, I mean, they must get a
[1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:20.620]  lot of traffic from these things, right? They must get, they must be, there must be some reason,
[1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:25.820]  there must be getting some return on their investment here. But I just, I think that this could be
[1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:31.100]  the problem why eBay has fallen behind some of these other retailer, retailer sites is like,
[1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:36.540]  figure out a better marketing method than spamming me as soon as I open my Windows A computer.
[1:02:36.540 --> 1:02:43.900]  Yeah, no, I think it's, it's, well, you've got a problem not just with your marketing but probably
[1:02:43.900 --> 1:02:50.300]  with your product as well. If your marketing campaign is you strategizing against your users.
[1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:53.900]  Right. You know, it doesn't matter what filtering really bothers me.
[1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:59.980]  You know, no one's opening their computer, maybe this is happening. Maybe someone is opening
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:04.380]  their computer seeing eBay and being like, you know what, I should really go sell that old
[1:03:04.380 --> 1:03:10.220]  coffee maker I have on eBay. Thank you for interrupting me in the middle of me trying to do
[1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:15.500]  something else to do that. I'm reminded of a couple years ago for a while, long while it seemed
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:22.140]  the only pop up ads I ever saw, like our pop under ads, it was, we're from Netflix.
[1:03:23.660 --> 1:03:29.740]  And that, you know, I had Safari and Chrome with built-in pop under blocking and it, you know,
[1:03:29.740 --> 1:03:34.940]  somehow and doesn't surprise me that Netflix was able to figure out, you know, was the, you know,
[1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:40.220]  a company that was smart enough to figure out loopholes through the pop under blocking.
[1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:45.260]  But it always struck me as why are they doing this? Why is Netflix of all companies, a company
[1:03:45.260 --> 1:03:49.980]  that I want to, like, that I do, like, why are they paying for these pop under ads?
[1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:53.980]  No, you're totally right. I would come back to my computer and I'd have a Netflix ad up on my screen.
[1:03:53.980 --> 1:03:58.940]  It was, they were the only ones I ever saw. Like, and, you know, on the one hand, I sort of salute
[1:03:58.940 --> 1:04:03.820]  their, their ingenuity for being the one company that was figuring out how to get around the
[1:04:03.820 --> 1:04:09.500]  built-in pop up and pop under blockers. But on the other hand, it's like, yeah, but why are they
[1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:15.100]  doing this thing that makes me think about maybe going over to Netflix and canceling my subscription?
[1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:21.020]  Right. Yeah, and that was probably before Netflix really had hit a big. I mean, I don't know.
[1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:24.540]  I don't know the last time I've seen it. No, yeah, it's been a, it's been a long time, but I,
[1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:29.420]  at the time, when I remember seeing them and being annoyed, they were still more of a disk
[1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:36.300]  service than a streaming service. But it just seemed like a very odd branding choice to associate
[1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:43.900]  themselves with a form of advertising that that browsers explicitly, that the browsers
[1:04:43.900 --> 1:04:51.420]  advertise, we block this stuff. Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, it was, it's very frustrating to
[1:04:51.420 --> 1:04:56.940]  that even on the highest and Windows laptops, you're still getting some of that, some of these
[1:04:56.940 --> 1:05:02.460]  crapware pieces. Because I'm just thinking through, I'm thinking, you know, the Acer that I talked
[1:05:02.460 --> 1:05:08.620]  about in that quick sidebar that I wrote to the laptop piece, that's a, that's a $1,300 computer. You
[1:05:08.620 --> 1:05:17.180]  can get it now for $9.99 or I think it was $8.99 at Microsoft stores. And I, I really did a lot
[1:05:17.180 --> 1:05:20.940]  of chilling there for, I mean, I've basically telling everyone, go buy your, your computers at
[1:05:20.940 --> 1:05:24.540]  Microsoft stores because A, you're getting these really good deals on them. And then B, they're
[1:05:24.540 --> 1:05:29.660]  not selling them with junk wear. So everyone buy your computers from Microsoft stores if you're in
[1:05:29.660 --> 1:05:35.340]  the market for a Windows PC. But I had gotten this one from Acer. And I mean, this is a third,
[1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:39.820]  it comes with a nice case. The box smelled good. I mean, like the whole thing is like a really
[1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:45.500]  premium package. You cannot even believe Acer made this computer. I mean, I can remember
[1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:50.060]  reviewing some of the worst, some of the worst technology that I remember reviewing came from Acer,
[1:05:50.060 --> 1:05:55.020]  like terrible laptops years ago. And so like you look at this beautiful piece of hardware,
[1:05:55.020 --> 1:06:00.780]  you open it up the thing. And then you see Norton, eBay, tons of third party apps that you're just
[1:06:00.780 --> 1:06:09.500]  like, we're, you know, I think they were from some sort of Chinese, what's a A, B word processor or
[1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:14.620]  something like that. I can't really remember the, the name of the company. But you know, like,
[1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:19.020]  you just paid really like, you paid a lot of money for a really nice computer. Why is this stuff
[1:06:19.020 --> 1:06:26.140]  still sitting here? Clearly, I'm going to agree about it. I do. Meanwhile, I think, I think it's worth
[1:06:26.140 --> 1:06:31.500]  getting angry about though. I do. Because especially, you know, especially for the ones that you
[1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:36.620]  pay a premium for, like if you're, if you're buying a two or three hundred dollar laptop,
[1:06:37.180 --> 1:06:42.140]  it still stinks that you're getting loaded with, like getting it loaded with crapware. But
[1:06:42.140 --> 1:06:47.420]  you can understand the economics of it. But again, like you said, a $999 laptop, if your laptop
[1:06:47.420 --> 1:06:52.940]  is a hundred dollars more than the entry level MacBook, that's, that's, you know, you're a new
[1:06:52.940 --> 1:06:58.620]  premium price zone. Like famously, Apple's, you know, MacBooks are started at the high end of,
[1:06:58.620 --> 1:07:03.660]  of prices. And there's really, I just can't see how it's, why are you nickel, nickel and
[1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:07.340]  diming them? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I made it, but it's exactly what you said before. It's that that's
[1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:12.060]  where many of these companies are making profit and the sales teams from Acer to Dow to all these
[1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:17.340]  are convincing these people that it's great real estate. But on a $999 laptop or a 1399 laptop
[1:07:17.340 --> 1:07:21.020]  that shouldn't be where they're making a profit. They should be able to, you know, make a profit
[1:07:21.020 --> 1:07:26.620]  selling that with a clean version of Windows. That's true. There's a question. But there,
[1:07:26.620 --> 1:07:31.180]  these are the add-ons that they're, you know, it's better for them. And then on top of it,
[1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:36.700]  they, they skin the browsers. That's another thing Acer does. Still. Yeah. Really? How do they,
[1:07:36.700 --> 1:07:41.340]  what does that mean? That means there's like a tool bra, like a toolbar that's preloaded in the
[1:07:41.340 --> 1:07:49.180]  browser, but you know, again, 1998 yet again with eBay. Wow. I mean, the eBay stuff really bothers me.
[1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:55.980]  I'm not sure why. Like maybe if it was a link to a better, I just don't do that much stuff on eBay
[1:07:55.980 --> 1:08:01.340]  anymore. Yeah. You know what? Amazon's in the, in the same business Amazon, um, I think it,
[1:08:01.340 --> 1:08:08.860]  maybe it was Toshiba preloads their app preloads and Amazon app. I don't know. Wow.
[1:08:08.860 --> 1:08:15.100]  Yeah. I should have done this more scientifically and done it. What about the Chromebooks? Now,
[1:08:15.100 --> 1:08:20.860]  Chromebooks are really low price points. You know, for the most part, I mean, you know, like the,
[1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:27.020]  the, what's the Google one, the pixel aside? Right. Um, but most of them, you know, the whole
[1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:32.780]  point of them is that they're sort of the new net books pricing wise. Are they, did they come with
[1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:40.620]  crap where? No. No. And, and Google is very strict about what these OEMs can put on.
[1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:46.460]  Are they, they are just like Android in some ways, you know, where they have sort of these
[1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:51.100]  strict guidelines. I mean, obviously, you know, they let people customize their way more
[1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:57.580]  controlled when it comes to Chromebooks. So I wonder if Microsoft can't enforce it just because of
[1:08:57.580 --> 1:09:05.740]  the remaining fallout from the 1997 antitrust stuff that they can't maybe they can't bring the
[1:09:05.740 --> 1:09:10.620]  hammer down and say you can't because I know, you know, because Ben Thompson used to work at Microsoft
[1:09:10.620 --> 1:09:16.220]  and he's, you know, been explicit about it publicly that it's a huge frustration inside the halls
[1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:24.940]  in Redmond that the windows that most people see is so junked up right from the start.
[1:09:24.940 --> 1:09:29.100]  Well, I mean, it does affect performance. There's no doubt that it affects performance.
[1:09:29.100 --> 1:09:33.340]  You know, if this was just stuff that you could just sweep away and put it in like a little
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:37.660]  folder, that's one, but this stuff affects performance. You have these things popping up.
[1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:41.100]  I, you know, one of the apps opened because it told me I had to like, you know,
[1:09:41.100 --> 1:09:46.060]  do I want to agree or whatever? And the wild tangent games, that's a whole other
[1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:49.820]  situation where if you open that up, that's running in the browser and they've got another app
[1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:56.620]  that's running. So yeah, I mean, no doubt Microsoft has been upset about this stuff forever and
[1:09:56.620 --> 1:10:01.660]  that's why they're offering it in their stores without this. Yeah. And I think that it's,
[1:10:01.660 --> 1:10:09.660]  you know, for a long time, I mean, Apple's always focused on a lot of effort on a first run
[1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:15.900]  experience on good stuff like good packaging and stuff like that. Even before you turn a device on
[1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:22.140]  that you should be already be having a good experience just opening the box. And for a long time,
[1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:25.900]  they were unique in that regard because they were sort of the wild stepchild of the industry,
[1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:30.700]  but you know, anybody who's successful, people are going to start studying what they do and
[1:10:30.700 --> 1:10:36.540]  clearly Apple's, you know, the last 10 years is the most successful gadget maker in the industry.
[1:10:37.260 --> 1:10:41.740]  And I think it's caught on and everybody is, you know, the average packaging in general,
[1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:46.460]  like you're saying that even an Acer comes with good packaging now. I think that's, I think that's,
[1:10:46.460 --> 1:10:50.460]  I think that's the Apple effect. It smells almost as good as an app as a MacBook. And yes,
[1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:55.740]  you know, this thing about laptop smells is very important. Hi, you know, I remember I used to have,
[1:10:55.740 --> 1:11:03.420]  in college, I had one of my jobs, like an internship was more or less like an IT job. And so
[1:11:03.420 --> 1:11:10.060]  sometimes I give a new, our department was getting a new shipment of computers in. I know exactly
[1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:13.820]  what you're talking about. We used to get Dell's at this place. And, you know, we'd have like
[1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:19.900]  eight boxes to open. And they did, there was like a bad smell, like a, I don't know, like an acidic
[1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:29.740]  plastic-y smell. Yeah. Um, I think there was an HP or a couple of years ago. No, no, no, no. It was
[1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:35.100]  Dell last year, where people were complaining that they're lapped, the new laptops were smelling
[1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:42.060]  like urine. I can remember that. I do remember that. And people were writing in and it had
[1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:47.580]  someone to do with like the glue or some sort of thing. Yeah, I mean, you can get a bad
[1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:52.300]  smelling laptop. I mean, mostly though, like, I have this like, I just love the smell of new
[1:11:52.300 --> 1:11:58.140]  laptop. It's like a new car, you know, I have, I'm really showing my hands here on this podcast.
[1:11:58.780 --> 1:12:04.220]  I know exactly what you mean now. I do know it. It's like a new MacBook smells really good. I mean,
[1:12:04.220 --> 1:12:10.380]  it's like, and a new MacBook Air even better. Yeah. Yeah. It's no coincidence, you know, that's
[1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:14.540]  not just by chance. It's, you know, about you caring about stuff like that and using good
[1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:20.060]  materials and not using cheap glue and. Yeah. But I do remember that like, like when we would have
[1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:25.260]  like a, hey, eight new PCs came in, we got to set them up and it was, you know, it wasn't like,
[1:12:25.260 --> 1:12:29.740]  like, you know, there's people who work with raw sewage. I mean, there are a lot worse smells
[1:12:29.740 --> 1:12:34.140]  that people have on a regular basis on their job, but it wasn't pleasant. Right. We're terrible.
[1:12:34.140 --> 1:12:38.300]  People, we sit here. We are horrible people complaining about the smell. We have to open up a
[1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:47.820]  laptop that doesn't smell good. Oh, my job is so hard. But that's interesting. It is interesting
[1:12:47.820 --> 1:12:52.460]  to me though that a Chromebooks don't have that problem. You know, and the first run experience,
[1:12:52.460 --> 1:12:57.020]  like here, I've got this new thing. I, you know, I just bought it. And that's when you're like,
[1:12:57.020 --> 1:13:02.220]  you know, it's, it's a psychological thing. First impressions really do matter. Okay, turn it on.
[1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:06.460]  Here's how I turn it on. What's the first thing I see? Am I getting broad, you know, a barrage of
[1:13:06.460 --> 1:13:13.020]  ads or am I getting a, you know, professional designers have, you know, given you this onboarding
[1:13:13.020 --> 1:13:18.940]  experience to make it pleasant. It matters. Cause that's like your first impression of the device,
[1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:25.100]  the first time you turn it on is, is like the starting point of the graph of your customer satisfaction
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:30.780]  with it. Right? It's not like you, your customer satisfaction doesn't start at zero and start
[1:13:30.780 --> 1:13:38.140]  inching up. It, it, it starts somewhere based on that first experience. Right. Or the excitement
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:42.620]  that you've got a new product and you're excited to open it. And then it's like, you know,
[1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:46.780]  is it the record scratch? Or are you, you know, is there, you know, happy music? Are you,
[1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:52.940]  are you enjoying getting this new thing? Yeah, that's a good point because when your device is,
[1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:56.780]  it's just like a brand new car. You're excited. You're excited to just go to the grocery store,
[1:13:56.780 --> 1:14:00.380]  drive to the grocery store when you have a brand new car because it's, you got a new car.
[1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:05.340]  Yeah. I mean, I open, I open phones all the time. But when I get my own new phone,
[1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:11.180]  that is a different experience. Right. I'm like, this is mine. Like this, this is going to be mine
[1:14:11.180 --> 1:14:16.940]  for however long, you know, the foreseeable future four years, many, many people keep their laptops,
[1:14:16.940 --> 1:14:20.780]  you know, all right. I think that's what it used to be. I don't know now if that's the case,
[1:14:20.780 --> 1:14:25.820]  but I think it's longer and longer. I think that's part of the problem that the PC industry is
[1:14:25.820 --> 1:14:29.900]  facing. Right. I said people are honing them longer because they're doing stuff like, you know,
[1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:33.820]  they don't feel like they need a new PC that often because they're doing so much on their tablets.
[1:14:33.820 --> 1:14:38.220]  Right. Or surfing, or they're just, you know, in the blad browser and they don't need to have
[1:14:38.220 --> 1:14:44.220]  the other power that is that they have. Yeah. But that is interesting to me, that Google enforces
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:50.060]  that pretty tight, even on these devices that are selling for as low as 250 bucks. Yeah, definitely.
[1:14:50.060 --> 1:14:55.900]  I mean, mostly also they don't, you know, the hardware is so low end. You know, when you,
[1:14:55.900 --> 1:15:03.500]  even this Acer, I have the 299 C 720, the Chromebook. I mean, this is not a nice feeling
[1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:10.780]  computer, but it's fine for the price. Yeah. I've seen it. And I know that it's the,
[1:15:11.420 --> 1:15:17.580]  I think it's one of the main ways that Chromebooks are starting to actually have an effect
[1:15:17.580 --> 1:15:23.500]  on the industry is like K-12 education. Sure. Yeah. Like at my son's school, they do have
[1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:27.900]  some iPads, but it's an awful lot of Chromebooks. And like when they do writing and stuff like that,
[1:15:29.580 --> 1:15:36.220]  it's in a Chromebook and in Google Docs. Yeah. And I can't really blame them. And it's funny
[1:15:36.220 --> 1:15:39.740]  talking to my son about it. He and his friends, they do complain about them because most of these
[1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:44.540]  kids have like Apple stuff at home. And they even complain about the things being, this isn't like,
[1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:50.860]  like my son playing to me and knowing, if anything, he would tease me. And if he, if he knew
[1:15:50.860 --> 1:15:55.260]  better, he'd tease me and tell me how much he likes the Chromebook. It's just, you know, me
[1:15:55.260 --> 1:15:59.980]  subtly gauging his opinions. I go, yeah, it's a real piece of junk, you know, like the trackpad.
[1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:06.380]  You know, and the kids are nuts. I've said this before. Kids today are nuts about things
[1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:10.220]  like frame rate because it's all from the games. And you know, even, even just using the
[1:16:10.220 --> 1:16:15.020]  Chromebook for school work, it's like he's like on terrible frame rate. Yeah. He says frame rate.
[1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:19.260]  Yeah. Oh, kids today, kids today are nuts about frame rates. And they all know,
[1:16:19.260 --> 1:16:23.260]  60, everybody knows that 60 is what you want that you want 60 frames per second.
[1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:29.740]  Um, hold on. I think, I think kids definitely know slow now because like they're like, my iPad
[1:16:29.740 --> 1:16:35.420]  doesn't do that. But do you think maybe only your kid knows the word frame rate? No, definitely not
[1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:43.100]  because they watch, they all watch, um, uh, YouTube videos nonstop of video games. Yep. And while
[1:16:43.100 --> 1:16:48.220]  they, this is, this is what kids like Minecraft, it doesn't matter whether, yeah, Minecraft,
[1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:52.140]  the, the, you know, the Arkham Batman game. It doesn't matter what games you play. What you do
[1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:57.900]  as a kid today is you start playing a video game on device A, could be your phone. And it could
[1:16:57.900 --> 1:17:05.260]  be your iPad could be, you know, like a Wii U or whatever. And then on device B, you watch videos
[1:17:05.260 --> 1:17:10.620]  of people playing the same game at the same time. And it's, you know, it's nonstop chatter about things
[1:17:10.620 --> 1:17:16.780]  like frame rate and stuff like that. It's not from like a, uh, trust me, he's not unusual. He's
[1:17:16.780 --> 1:17:23.660]  10. Oh my God. And trust me, frame rates, frame rates are a huge deal. That's so funny.
[1:17:23.660 --> 1:17:29.340]  It just, really, I, you know, I didn't even think about that. I mean, I, um, at work, the, the makeup
[1:17:29.340 --> 1:17:34.700]  artist, her daughter talks to me about Minecraft constantly. And she, and she's constantly, you know,
[1:17:34.700 --> 1:17:39.020]  timing. Oh, well, I saw this video of Minecraft and, you know, they built this and they did that.
[1:17:39.020 --> 1:17:42.940]  So I totally know what you're, I just, I, the idea that like a kid would be sitting like,
[1:17:42.940 --> 1:17:47.020]  oh, yeah, the frame rate on this Chromebook is terrible. Like the fact that a kid would be saying
[1:17:47.020 --> 1:17:51.260]  that is amazing to me. And so I thought in my head, like, oh, yeah, of course, of course,
[1:17:51.260 --> 1:17:55.820]  John's, no, but it's not, yeah, it, you would, it, that would make some degree of sense,
[1:17:55.820 --> 1:18:00.860]  but it's not, it, it isn't, it's just common. Like, uh, uh, one of the most disparaging words,
[1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:04.700]  like a fourth or fifth grader can use to describe something is, uh, laggy.
[1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:12.060]  laggy is, lagginess is a huge issue. All these kids are going to be way better reviewers than I am.
[1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:16.540]  Yeah, it's a huge deal with all the kids who are in the Minecraft, because like Minecraft is so
[1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:22.380]  extensible, you can plug in like new shaders so that you can get like totally, totally different
[1:18:22.380 --> 1:18:28.620]  graphics engine. Um, but it slows the hell down. Right. It's, it's, you know, if you're running
[1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:32.780]  it on like a MacBook Air or something like that, you get lagginess. And it's, that's, that's a,
[1:18:32.780 --> 1:18:37.180]  this is the worst thing that could possibly happen. It's horrible. But anyway, I can totally see
[1:18:37.180 --> 1:18:41.820]  why schools are loading up on these things because if I were going to put devices in the hands of
[1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:47.500]  fourth and fifth graders, um, you know, it makes it awful, a lot of sense to give them a $200
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:52.140]  thing that if they drop and needs, it needs to be replaced, you know, it's not going to crack like,
[1:18:52.140 --> 1:19:00.380]  like an iPad. Right. Hmm. Yeah. And that also, it ties into another thing that you've written
[1:19:00.380 --> 1:19:06.060]  about recently, which I wanted to mention, which is the, you did a whole thing on, um, do you still
[1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:12.620]  need that Microsoft Office? Yeah. You see the pattern here. It was, it was Microsoft August in my
[1:19:12.620 --> 1:19:17.500]  life. Um, it just happened that those topics sort of were in a good succession because I did the
[1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:24.780]  laptop piece. And obviously, you know, the piece led with recommending, um, the air. And I got a
[1:19:24.780 --> 1:19:29.980]  lot of emails from people saying, well, how am I supposed to use the air without Microsoft
[1:19:29.980 --> 1:19:33.660]  office? And so I had to write back to people and explain to them Microsoft office has been
[1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:40.300]  available for the air for a really long time. And forever. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure of
[1:19:40.300 --> 1:19:47.740]  Microsoft Excel shipped on the Mac first. It was, you know, I didn't well. And then to their credit,
[1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:52.140]  some people wrote back and said, yes, but it's a far inferior product on the Mac. And I said,
[1:19:52.140 --> 1:19:56.780]  I actually agree. I have, I use Microsoft Office on, on my Mac. And I actually run parallel
[1:19:56.780 --> 1:20:02.700]  sometimes to run, uh, Windows, I mean, Microsoft Office 365 because you get a better outlook experience,
[1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:08.140]  blah, blah, blah. Um, so it just started getting, you know, my, we thinking, okay, well, maybe
[1:20:08.140 --> 1:20:12.300]  we should do a piece right now explaining to people that maybe they don't need Microsoft office.
[1:20:13.260 --> 1:20:16.780]  And so yeah, that was, that was that piece. And then it just happened to be that,
[1:20:16.780 --> 1:20:22.300]  that Windows eight was Windows phone eight was launching on this HGC. And so every week, I feel like
[1:20:22.300 --> 1:20:27.340]  as if I've been giving a nice look at what's going on in Redmond.
[1:20:27.340 --> 1:20:33.580]  Well, and I do think that there's an interesting angle there on education where, you know,
[1:20:33.580 --> 1:20:38.460]  like in my son's school, like the lot of the stuff he does, it gets sub turned into the teacher
[1:20:38.460 --> 1:20:45.340]  by Google Docs that you don't have, um, documents. There's no, you don't save stuff to your hard
[1:20:45.340 --> 1:20:52.540]  drive and then print it out and hand it in. It's, you know, he, I don't, I'm not even sure exactly
[1:20:52.540 --> 1:20:58.060]  what the steps are that he does, but it's, you know, it's completely through the school's
[1:20:59.260 --> 1:21:06.460]  Google Docs thing, Google office thing. Yeah, I mean, I, my entire editing process is now done in,
[1:21:06.460 --> 1:21:11.580]  in Google Docs. I mean, we, when I deal with the print editors, we, we move back to, to word,
[1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:16.140]  but, um, when I deal with my direct editor, we're, we're just completely in Google Docs. And it's a
[1:21:16.140 --> 1:21:23.340]  great, I mean, I compared office or word online and Excel online and PowerPoint online to Google
[1:21:23.340 --> 1:21:29.260]  Docs and then also what Apple's been doing with, um, iCloud pages and spreadsheets and,
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:34.620]  or I mean, with numbers and keynote and, you know, all of those platforms have added really
[1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:40.540]  substantial sharing and collaboration features, but Google still has just, it's, it's really
[1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:45.820]  built into the platform. Like you can tell that that's where this was built. Like this, that was
[1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:50.380]  the main reason they built some of these features or these platforms. Like it's almost like,
[1:21:50.380 --> 1:21:54.620]  I, I, and I think this is actually true. I think Google built Google Docs so they would be able
[1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:59.580]  to collaborate on documents rather than just have something that lived in the cloud. Um,
[1:21:59.580 --> 1:22:04.300]  and it, it feels that way. Like the sharing capabilities are better than being able to comment on
[1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:09.260]  what somebody's written, being able to live edit and watch them live edit. It all works better
[1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:16.300]  still on Google stuff. Yeah. And I do think that it's a good, I think you're exactly right that it's,
[1:22:16.300 --> 1:22:22.460]  it really matters where the product started. Right. Right. So I have to say Apple, the, the new
[1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:26.140]  iCloud pages, I don't know if you've tried the sharing functionality, but they have some interesting
[1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:29.500]  stuff in there that I actually, you know, there were a couple small features. I'm like, I wish Google
[1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:34.700]  Docs had this now. Um, so, you know, they've got it, they're still playing catch up on some of the
[1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:40.380]  other things like commenting, like seeing some of that live editing. Um, but like, if I sent you my,
[1:22:40.380 --> 1:22:44.380]  my iCloud pages thing now, you don't have to log in at all. You can just create a name like
[1:22:44.380 --> 1:22:49.420]  you can just write, you know, Gruber and you can just jump into the document without having to log
[1:22:49.420 --> 1:22:54.700]  in at all. And I think that's actually a feature that Google and the, and the big thing too is that
[1:22:54.700 --> 1:23:00.140]  you don't, I mean, the whole basis of all of that sharing is that you don't have to coordinate any,
[1:23:00.140 --> 1:23:04.060]  okay, I'm going to open it now. Don't, don't make any changes on your side. Like,
[1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:10.300]  Dropbox is an amazing, amazing service, but like, if you're sharing a document between two people
[1:23:10.300 --> 1:23:16.460]  on Dropbox, like an app that's not meant, doesn't really, isn't aware of Dropbox, just open it up in
[1:23:16.460 --> 1:23:22.460]  numbers or whatever. Um, you can easily run into problems, even just with yourself, if you have it
[1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:27.260]  open on two machines at the same time, where you make changes on one side and different changes on
[1:23:27.260 --> 1:23:32.940]  the other side, and now you've, you know, you're overriding it as opposed to, um, you know,
[1:23:32.940 --> 1:23:39.340]  being in one place. Well, and having it set up, you know, Google Docs from day one, where as you type
[1:23:39.340 --> 1:23:45.900]  in the document that on your end, the keystroke show up online, right? Right. And it's, it's, um,
[1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:51.340]  meant to be used by different people at the same time and meant for that as opposed to
[1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:59.340]  the problems you can run into with apps that are rooted in a design where it's your file on your
[1:23:59.340 --> 1:24:05.820]  computer. Yeah. That's a great point. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, I mean, I was actually
[1:24:05.820 --> 1:24:09.420]  really impressed where, where Apple's gone with that. I mean, Microsoft has had a lot of these
[1:24:09.420 --> 1:24:14.300]  features, and they're getting better. Um, but the problem with, with Microsoft is they're still
[1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:19.660]  trying to bring these features to the desktop version. And it just doesn't work there. It just really
[1:24:19.660 --> 1:24:24.220]  doesn't work there. Yeah. And the other thing too, and you see it, you know, there's actually the
[1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:27.100]  same, there's actually the same problem with pages, you know, the sharing is really good in iCloud
[1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:31.980]  pages. But when you try and do it from the desktop app, it's, it's not as good. Yeah. And that's a
[1:24:31.980 --> 1:24:36.780]  real problem. I think it's a real problem because the desktop version in every other regard is better,
[1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:41.820]  you know, in terms of just, you know, like going back to lagging this and stuff like that, like,
[1:24:41.820 --> 1:24:49.420]  you know, native, um, apps run better than apps that are jury rigged through HTML and JavaScript
[1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:53.980]  and CSS. But the, you're right, though, that the sharing stuff doesn't work as well, like in terms
[1:24:53.980 --> 1:25:00.540]  of live updates and stuff that they're still like these roots of an old school, you know, your
[1:25:00.540 --> 1:25:07.580]  file saved to your hard disk mentality there. Right. But I mean, you know, when you look at the whole
[1:25:07.580 --> 1:25:13.340]  ecosystem of things, I mean, you know, as I talked about in this piece is like, you know, it
[1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:19.660]  ultimately comes down to what, what would you want to pay for? And I, and I conclude, you know,
[1:25:19.660 --> 1:25:24.940]  there's no reason to pay for office anymore if you just need the basics. And you can get those,
[1:25:24.940 --> 1:25:29.580]  and even if you prefer using the office interface, you can get all of that for free now through
[1:25:29.580 --> 1:25:36.220]  Word and Excel and PowerPoint online. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. But I do, and I
[1:25:36.220 --> 1:25:41.500]  wonder too how, how it's going to play out with, um, because it's the sort of thing like,
[1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:47.180]  it doesn't happen. Everything I try to focus on the big picture as much as I can. I think I
[1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:53.340]  do a better job than, than a lot of people who write about tech, but it's so hard to look past just
[1:25:53.340 --> 1:26:00.060]  even the next year. But it's some things take five, six, seven, 10 years. Like what happens when
[1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:06.700]  like today's 10 year olds are freshmen in college eight years from now? I think Microsoft office
[1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:11.660]  is going to seem like, you know, like using a mainframe from the 60s, like nobody's going to
[1:26:11.660 --> 1:26:18.220]  be using that. I couldn't agree more. I think, I think when you look at, well, it's, it's two things.
[1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:24.620]  One, it's the idea of installing software in, in the regards that you'd have to somehow install
[1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:30.620]  with, you know, office. Of course, now kids are really used to using apps. But I think the idea that
[1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:35.420]  kids have started to get, get used to is that they can just get that a lot, a lot of that stuff
[1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:40.060]  through the web browser. And then second of all, the idea of paying for something like that.
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:44.940]  I mean, I just, I don't think it's, I don't think it's the reality in 10 years.
[1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:50.700]  Yes. Well, and I think the other thing too is that with the file system mentality to submit
[1:26:50.700 --> 1:26:56.700]  your work to the teacher, whether it's printed or even if it was like, you know,
[1:26:56.700 --> 1:27:00.220]  I'm sure there's a lot of people who in the, you know, certainly since I've been in school,
[1:27:00.220 --> 1:27:04.460]  but who've been able to email their homework to their teachers and stuff like that. But when
[1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:08.380]  you do something like that, you're sending a copy. Doesn't matter whether it's a hard copy or
[1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:14.540]  still a digital copy, it's, okay, I've, I've sent a copy of this document as an email attachment.
[1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:19.500]  And now there's a copy of it. That, that whole, there's a bunch of different copies of it,
[1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:25.900]  mentality is. Right. It's not like the live living thing. Right. Right. Here's this, this one URL,
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:31.340]  and it's the same URL from my end as a student. It's where I go to type. And from the teachers
[1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:37.820]  end, it's just where they bring it up to read it and put their remarks. And you'd not, you know,
[1:27:37.820 --> 1:27:43.420]  the, the, the whole issue of having various versions of a document copied and, you know, who's got
[1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:48.860]  the right version. And now the teacher sent me a new copy back with, you know, with their comments,
[1:27:48.860 --> 1:27:53.020]  it's, it's craziness from, I think, from kids perspective today. Right. They're just not even
[1:27:53.020 --> 1:27:56.300]  going to get it. They're not even going to understand it. Right. And that's where, you know,
[1:27:56.300 --> 1:28:00.940]  who knows if we'll be paying for cloud storage then? I mean, if it all, all signs point to us,
[1:28:00.940 --> 1:28:04.940]  not really paying for cloud storage, even now at this point, I mean, we're paying what,
[1:28:04.940 --> 1:28:12.780]  for a terabyte of storage, $10 a month, expecting that to go down. I mean, so the, that sort of
[1:28:12.780 --> 1:28:19.020]  equation where you think, I'm not paying for the software, but I'm paying for this platform to keep
[1:28:19.020 --> 1:28:24.220]  these documents alive and not save them to my, like, as you're saying, and not saving them as a
[1:28:24.220 --> 1:28:29.820]  file. I'm not saving them as a copy seems to make more sense for the structure of these types
[1:28:29.820 --> 1:28:36.300]  of services. Yeah, which is that, you know, where Microsoft is going with this Office 365 thing.
[1:28:36.860 --> 1:28:40.700]  Yeah, I think that they see it, but I still think, even though that they see it and I think they're
[1:28:40.700 --> 1:28:46.060]  doing great work with it, um, they're still in a dangerous spot where they're, they're,
[1:28:46.060 --> 1:28:50.220]  they seem to need to, you know, financially, they need to protect the existing
[1:28:50.220 --> 1:28:54.380]  right operation than the existing business and it's in conflict with the future.
[1:28:55.020 --> 1:28:56.860]  Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:28:56.860 --> 1:29:05.020]  Hmm. No, it's, it's, it's been an interesting couple of columns to look at Microsoft and how
[1:29:05.020 --> 1:29:13.820]  they try and figure out how they form or fit into the future. Um, you know, even, even from the,
[1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:20.060]  the Windows laptop piece that I wrote, you know, when you look at, when you look at the problems
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:24.780]  and the thoughts that they had about Windows eight and where they've sort of ended up now,
[1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:30.780]  which is really kind of coming full circle back to, okay, we, we can't abandon core windows and
[1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:37.180]  we got to sort of come back to the traditional desktop and you look at all these devices that are
[1:29:37.180 --> 1:29:41.820]  supposed to be tablets that are supposed to be hybrid machines and really, I think a lot of people
[1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:49.020]  are just using them as traditional laptops. Um, you know, it's, it makes you wonder how cyclical
[1:29:49.020 --> 1:29:56.140]  some of this stuff is going to be. Yeah. Uh, let me take a last break right here, rounding out
[1:29:56.860 --> 1:30:03.980]  a, uh, group of sponsors, long time sponsors to all of them today on today's show is, uh,
[1:30:03.980 --> 1:30:09.740]  maybe the longest of long term sponsors of this show, uh, square space or good friends at
[1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:17.180]  square space. You've heard me mention them before. Um, square space makes it simple and easy
[1:30:17.180 --> 1:30:25.420]  to create and publish your own website. You sign up for square space. You pick one of their
[1:30:26.060 --> 1:30:31.660]  amazing, really attractive templates, all of which are responsive, ready to go from mobile phone
[1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:40.140]  to tablet to any size desktop display. Uh, use drag and drop to rearrange the components of the
[1:30:40.140 --> 1:30:47.900]  website, uh, get it just the way you want. Uh, and that's it. You just sign up, pick a template,
[1:30:48.140 --> 1:30:54.620]  drag and drop to customize and there you go. You've got a website could not be easier. Um,
[1:30:54.620 --> 1:31:01.340]  square space has 24 seven tech support. This is tech support that they want you to use.
[1:31:01.340 --> 1:31:06.620]  They take pride in it. I think it's maybe their most differentiating feature. Um, this isn't like
[1:31:06.620 --> 1:31:10.540]  a checklist. Like, yeah, there's somebody you can contact. No, they really, if you need help, if you
[1:31:10.540 --> 1:31:17.580]  have questions, contact them, they do it through live chat and email. No phone. Because who wants
[1:31:17.580 --> 1:31:21.820]  a phone call? I don't want to talk to anybody in the phone phone calls like like 20th century technology
[1:31:21.820 --> 1:31:28.300]  chat is way better. They'll get back to you right away and some tech support staff really know
[1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:32.940]  square space inside it out. And they really do want you to use them. They've got teams in, uh,
[1:31:32.940 --> 1:31:38.220]  uh, Dublin, Ireland, New York City, important. That's how they cover the whole, that's how they
[1:31:38.220 --> 1:31:45.740]  cover 24 seven by having teams in, uh, Europe, East Coast, US, West Coast, US. And here's the thing,
[1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:53.660]  plan start at just eight bucks a month. And if you sign up for a year, you get a free domain,
[1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:58.380]  eight bucks a month for a totally professional website. And you can do anything with the square
[1:31:58.380 --> 1:32:02.620]  space that you can make at a blog. You can use square space to publish a podcast. They've got
[1:32:02.620 --> 1:32:08.700]  built in support for that. Uh, you can create a store. You can create a gallery of your photographs
[1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:13.100]  or your artwork. Anything you might want to have a website for, they've got support for,
[1:32:14.380 --> 1:32:19.500]  including online commerce. Every, every site comes with an online store if you want it handles
[1:32:19.500 --> 1:32:27.340]  everything from, uh, security SSL, uh, to credit card, um, purchasing all sorts of stuff that's a
[1:32:27.340 --> 1:32:31.180]  huge pain in the ass. A lot of technical hurdles, if you want to roll it on your own,
[1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:38.860]  square space has it all built in. Uh, so what do you do? You can start a trial with no credit card
[1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:49.180]  required and start building your own website today. So what you do is go to squarespace.com slash
[1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:56.060]  Gruber. That's my last name, squarespace.com slash Gruber. That way you know you're coming from,
[1:32:56.060 --> 1:32:59.980]  uh, the talk show. And they'll know you're coming from there. You know, you might think,
[1:32:59.980 --> 1:33:03.100]  why does square space keep sponsoring the show? You know why? Because people like you
[1:33:04.620 --> 1:33:08.220]  go there, finally to say, hey, I do need a website. Maybe I should check out square space.
[1:33:08.220 --> 1:33:14.060]  And when they go, they use that URL or they use the code. There's a code JG when you actually
[1:33:14.060 --> 1:33:18.540]  sign up to pay after you go there, start building your website and we're ready to sign up. Use
[1:33:18.540 --> 1:33:24.140]  the code JG and you'll save 10% off your first purchase. If you do the thing where you sign up for
[1:33:24.140 --> 1:33:30.780]  you at a time, um, that could be a significant amount of money. Um, use those codes. That's how
[1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:36.060]  they know you got here from the show and people like you who do that use that code, use those URLs.
[1:33:36.060 --> 1:33:42.380]  That's how somebody like squarespace keeps coming back to support the show. Uh, so my thanks to
[1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:47.260]  Squarespace, check them out if you have any interest in building a website. Here's two more things
[1:33:47.260 --> 1:33:55.580]  I wanted to talk to you about after having gone through all those, um, laptops is first track pads.
[1:33:55.580 --> 1:34:01.740]  Like, is that still a problem on Windows PCs where the track pads are just grossly inferior to
[1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:07.900]  the MacBook ones or if they finally caught up a little bit? No, it's still it's it's it's still
[1:34:07.900 --> 1:34:13.500]  one of tech's greatest unsolved problems or mysteries. I do not understand why Windows PC
[1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:19.820]  makers cannot figure out how to make a track pad as good as apples. And it's not purely software
[1:34:19.820 --> 1:34:25.740]  because everything I've read is that when you run, it reboot your MacBook, you know, in Windows
[1:34:25.740 --> 1:34:31.820]  to boot camp. It has it's the best Windows track pad you'll ever use. Yep. Yep. I did I did a
[1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:35.820]  piece right before I left the verge a couple of years ago on why the MacBook Air was almost as
[1:34:35.820 --> 1:34:41.180]  good of an ultra book as any PC maker could make. Right. The track pad and keyboard were big part of
[1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:47.260]  it. Right. Um, you know, I even recommended in this laptop piece that just by one of these laptop,
[1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:51.340]  these windows eight laptops with the touch screen. First of all, they're just they're just like
[1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:56.620]  they're all competitive on pricing. You basically even from the $500 range, even down, you can get
[1:34:56.620 --> 1:35:00.860]  a Windows laptop with the touch screen. So just buy one with the touch screen because if you
[1:35:00.860 --> 1:35:03.820]  run into these problems with the track pad, you can reach out and touch the screen.
[1:35:03.820 --> 1:35:11.740]  It's almost like a small band aid on the problem. But, um, yeah, you know, in some places,
[1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:17.660]  it's been fixed. Like Lenovo's works better than some. Um, ASUS is I don't understand why that
[1:35:17.660 --> 1:35:25.340]  track pad is it's like trying to use sandpaper. Um, who else made a decent one? Uh,
[1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:30.620]  Acer's kind of breaks a little bit. It's just like it seems to be the last place they're
[1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:35.980]  focusing on. And it's like, that's one of them. I mean, if you can't navigate your computer,
[1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:40.300]  why do you have a computer? Yeah, it should be one of the first. I especially,
[1:35:41.580 --> 1:35:46.140]  I find, you know, because I have a desk, I still have a real keyboard and stuff at my desk where
[1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:53.180]  I try to do most of my writing. But when I'm on my MacBook Air, it's more, if anything, more than
[1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:58.540]  at my desk, it's a little bit more consumption. Yeah. And that means like needing to scroll and
[1:35:58.540 --> 1:36:02.460]  stuff like that. And if the track pad, every time the track pad gives me trouble, it's always
[1:36:02.460 --> 1:36:08.140]  annoying. You know, I can't. It's central to the experience to me. The track pad on the air,
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:13.100]  I mean, I actually now, this is an example, I have a Thunderbolt display at my desk at work.
[1:36:14.300 --> 1:36:19.340]  And, you know, some might, I think the IT guy said, well, just close your MacBook and just
[1:36:19.340 --> 1:36:24.460]  use that and we'll get you in a spare keyboard. And I said, no, I don't want to use the track pad,
[1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:30.540]  the magic track pad. And I really like my air's keyboard. So I want to use that as the home base
[1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:37.260]  and just look at the screen because I live with the track pad. I can't use a mouse.
[1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:42.220]  Yeah. Well, you know what I've seen. And I'm like you, you know, like you in Times Square just
[1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:48.300]  looking at, you know, can I find anybody using a Windows phone? When I travel, I do airports,
[1:36:48.300 --> 1:36:54.460]  I love to just look at what are people using? And on vacation, like a Disney world, what are people
[1:36:54.460 --> 1:36:58.700]  taking their pictures with when they're holding their cameras and tablets up? What kind of devices
[1:36:58.700 --> 1:37:06.860]  that I see so many people, but always with PCs almost never with a MacBook with mice with mice.
[1:37:06.860 --> 1:37:13.180]  I too. I this is like my thing too. I, I pretty much count laptops when I go in coffee shops
[1:37:13.180 --> 1:37:17.820]  and like I will just do like the mental math, like, okay, yeah, right through like, you know,
[1:37:17.820 --> 1:37:23.500]  looking at this place, 30% of the people in here are using PCs and, and they're at the,
[1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:27.740]  and then 50% are 100% of those 30% are using, are using mice.
[1:37:29.180 --> 1:37:37.820]  I saw two guys, you know, who were obviously colleagues setting up in like the hotel,
[1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:43.420]  uh, I forget where I was, but it was like in a hotel bar slash lounge, you know,
[1:37:43.420 --> 1:37:48.940]  but a relatively small table. They both had huge laptops, 15 inch PCs, you know, big,
[1:37:48.940 --> 1:37:52.620]  not, not air style ones. I know exactly what you're going to say with a tiny mouse.
[1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:58.220]  With the tiny mouse, but they were on the same table, like, um, battleship style, right,
[1:37:58.220 --> 1:38:03.740]  you know what I mean? Like the, but it was a small cocktail table with two big laptops.
[1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:08.220]  They only had like a few inches and they both had mice and they're just the, they had to pick up
[1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:12.300]  them, you know, they had to keep picking it up to move it around. And it's like a Charlie
[1:38:12.300 --> 1:38:16.220]  that one's good. Right. And I was like, wonder what they're doing. And you know, just curious
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.820]  as I went to the restaurant, I'd like look over and they were both doing something in Excel,
[1:38:19.820 --> 1:38:24.060]  or some other spreadsheet. I don't know, it's, you know, but clearly they were doing spreadsheet work,
[1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:28.940]  but they both with these huge laptops and no room on the table were using mice and I thought,
[1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:33.660]  man, that is gotta be a sign that, you know, that they've got terrible track pads.
[1:38:33.660 --> 1:38:38.620]  Right. Or it's, it's habit. Like I think people have this habit of using mice. They know how to
[1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:41.820]  use their keyboard shortcuts with their left hand and they have their right hand on the mouse.
[1:38:42.460 --> 1:38:50.380]  But I don't, I don't know why. Um, I, I, I would say if you asked most people who own a MacBook
[1:38:50.380 --> 1:38:55.820]  or a MacBook Air, like the number one thing they like about it is the touch pad, um, or the track pad.
[1:38:55.820 --> 1:39:03.820]  But, you know, this is how the other half lives. I don't know. I, I, I, I used to tackle it more when I
[1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:09.820]  would meet with companies like Synaptics who make the, the sensors and the, and the touch panels
[1:39:09.820 --> 1:39:15.180]  for the, the PCs and I actually think they do work with Apple as well. Um, and for a while they were,
[1:39:15.180 --> 1:39:21.420]  you know, I'd, I'd heard that Apple had some extra IP on certain types of touch and stuff like that.
[1:39:21.420 --> 1:39:26.380]  I, I simply think for most of these, it's just getting the hardware and the software to work better
[1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:31.900]  together. And you know, I, I thought that's why I have to, you know, I, I was upset a little bit that
[1:39:31.900 --> 1:39:36.940]  Microsoft just didn't turn the Surface Pro 3 into a laptop. Um, you know, because my biggest problem
[1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:43.100]  with that is like, you went pretty far here. You've got a really nice system, but this is not a laptop
[1:39:43.100 --> 1:39:49.100]  replacement because the keyboard and the track pad are so crappy. I mean, and, and that's this, I see
[1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:54.140]  that also in New York a lot. If I do see someone with a surface and there's one person at my local
[1:39:54.140 --> 1:40:01.980]  coffee shop and she has a surface too. And she hangs a little mouse from the side. And she, you know,
[1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:06.860]  because the, the USB ports are on, on the screen, right? So you, you have the mouse hanging from
[1:40:06.860 --> 1:40:15.100]  the side of the screen. And it's just like, this is exactly the problem right here. Like, that's
[1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:20.460]  just the photo to explain the entire review. Like, it's not as good of a laptop because the parts
[1:40:20.460 --> 1:40:26.220]  that make this a laptop, which is a keyboard and a track pad, are not as good as real laptops.
[1:40:26.220 --> 1:40:31.340]  Right. Well, and that brings me to the flip side of the same thing. The other thing I wanted to
[1:40:31.340 --> 1:40:42.140]  ask you about is the laptop devices with touch screens and Apple's explanation for why they haven't
[1:40:42.140 --> 1:40:46.860]  done that. I mean, and this is many, this is a years old explanation. I mean, Steve Jobs,
[1:40:46.860 --> 1:40:50.780]  I think was the one who delivered it. And so it's, you know, gotta be, you know, three, four years,
[1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:56.700]  is that, you know, they've tried it in ergonomically. It's unpleasant to just have to stick your
[1:40:56.700 --> 1:41:03.100]  arm out. It's, it's just a weird angle. And it's not, it's not good. And do you find that that's
[1:41:03.100 --> 1:41:07.260]  true actually using devices like say Chromebooks that have touch screens?
[1:41:07.260 --> 1:41:12.700]  And more, you know, so I, the number one PC that I did like was the Lenovo Yoga,
[1:41:12.700 --> 1:41:16.780]  which if anyone from Lenovo, I'm just going to keep saying this, like you should have called it
[1:41:16.780 --> 1:41:17.820]  the Lenovo Yoga.
[1:41:20.300 --> 1:41:25.660]  Totally. I've been calling in the video by accident. I'm sure nobody noticed,
[1:41:25.660 --> 1:41:31.340]  because, well, no, a lot of people did watch that video. I called it Lenovo twice.
[1:41:31.340 --> 1:41:34.460]  Yeah, I did hear that. I didn't hear that. I didn't go to Lenovo.
[1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:37.820]  And I was, and one of the editors like, oh, you need to rego do that. I'm like, oh, no,
[1:41:37.820 --> 1:41:41.020]  it'll notice. And it's like, you know what, even if they do notice, this is what they should have
[1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:45.340]  called it. This is what they should have called it. Either the Lenovo Yoga or just change your name
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:45.980]  to Lenovo.
[1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:54.220]  Anyway, I really like that device because it does do that flipping thing, but the, the touch screen,
[1:41:55.180 --> 1:42:01.100]  the touch screen is really nice. And so I ended up using the touch screen more when I would,
[1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:05.260]  I did do the flip thing, you know, that you flip it around and you can use it as what
[1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:09.660]  are they called it tablet or stand mode. And I, you know, I did take advantage of that. I,
[1:42:09.660 --> 1:42:15.100]  you know, it would end up just kind of surfing the bed, surfing the, uh, the web in bed and just
[1:42:15.100 --> 1:42:15.900]  do it that way.
[1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:20.860]  Isn't it weird to have in the buttons of the keyboard sticking out on the back?
[1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:25.180]  Yeah, it is weird. And this is something that like none of these have figured out. I mean,
[1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:31.900]  one of the thing pad ones, they actually, um, they go up into the, into the thing, what are they
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:33.740]  called? They like, recess?
[1:42:33.740 --> 1:42:40.620]  Yeah, they sort of recess, but like, um, yeah, I mean, they, I mean, they don't work, right? Like,
[1:42:40.620 --> 1:42:42.460]  the keyboard is disabled in that way.
[1:42:42.460 --> 1:42:47.020]  Right. Once you've folded around the keyboard board, the keystrokes don't, don't register.
[1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:51.740]  Right. And I, you know, I don't, I, I haven't used these like long enough to see if the wear
[1:42:51.740 --> 1:42:55.660]  and tear of, you know, if I were to do that at a coffee shop or if I would be doing that on an
[1:42:55.660 --> 1:43:01.500]  airplane table or a tray table, if that would be uncomfortable. Um, but, you know, when I was
[1:43:01.500 --> 1:43:07.580]  using mostly just to like surf the web in bed, I, I like the experience. And like I said,
[1:43:07.580 --> 1:43:11.980]  I would find myself reaching out to use the screen more when, let's say, the track pad wasn't working
[1:43:11.980 --> 1:43:16.300]  in internet explorer or when I'm trying to scroll down along document. And that's just an easier
[1:43:16.300 --> 1:43:22.300]  way to get through things. The thing that I've heard from, like in the email I get from,
[1:43:22.300 --> 1:43:30.060]  from readers, um, because there's been a lot more speculation growing speculation as the arm
[1:43:30.060 --> 1:43:35.420]  processors get faster and faster and they have such energy advantages over Intel processors,
[1:43:35.420 --> 1:43:41.820]  you know, speculation would Apple ever, you know, make a Mac with arm processors. And every time
[1:43:41.820 --> 1:43:46.060]  I link to something like that or speculated about it myself, I usually get a couple of emails from
[1:43:46.060 --> 1:43:51.500]  people saying, well, what if, what if it's not, what if they do switch and start making laptops
[1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:56.620]  with arm processors, but they don't run Mac OS, they run iOS, you know, that that's what a lot
[1:43:56.620 --> 1:44:03.100]  of people want is like not, not like the surface where it's a cover that you detach with the
[1:44:03.100 --> 1:44:09.660]  keyboard, but an actual like MacBook Air form factor, but it's running iOS and then, but, you know,
[1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:17.500]  and, and, um, I was just listening to eight, the accidental tech podcast, uh, that most recent
[1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:21.660]  episode and John Syracuse have pointed out on the show. First question is, well, then what's the
[1:44:21.660 --> 1:44:27.740]  input? Is there, is there, do you add a mouse? There is no mouse in iOS and, you know, do you
[1:44:27.740 --> 1:44:33.580]  have to reach out and you have to reach out and touch the screen all the time? Like how pleasant
[1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:40.220]  is that in real life to use the touchscreen while it's a true laptop form factor? Right. Well,
[1:44:40.220 --> 1:44:44.940]  I mean, part of part, like part of what I'm saying with Windows 8 is that the touchscreen is still
[1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:50.540]  very much a crutch, right? Like, it's a crutch for the trackpad issues. And it's also a crutch for
[1:44:50.540 --> 1:44:55.980]  the fact that Windows 8 was not designed, you know, they, they tried to layer on top a touch in her
[1:44:55.980 --> 1:45:01.100]  face. So one of the easiest ways to swipe through apps is just to, you know, swipe them from the
[1:45:01.100 --> 1:45:06.140]  side. And those are other situations where I find when I'm using Windows 8, I just reach out and
[1:45:06.140 --> 1:45:10.460]  use this and touch the screen. So it's definitely for me, you know, now that I'm really thinking
[1:45:10.460 --> 1:45:14.940]  about it, those are the two main times when I would use the touchscreen to scroll through things
[1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:25.020]  or to swipe in other apps from the sides. Um, yeah, I think, you know, I guess, I guess the question
[1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:35.180]  when I think about iOS, you know, I can't really imagine using it with a mouse. No, I can't,
[1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:40.700]  either. And it's really unpleasant if you, like as a developer, if you just, you can, you can do
[1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:45.740]  it. You can run iOS apps as a developer on your Mac when you're testing it. And it's horrible.
[1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:50.460]  It's really, really bad. So you know, and clicking around things on with the mouse. And I'm sure
[1:45:50.460 --> 1:45:54.940]  they could somehow make it a little better and add shortcuts so that you could, you know, two
[1:45:54.940 --> 1:45:59.500]  fingers scroll or something. Right. I don't know. But the only place you would want to do it. And
[1:45:59.500 --> 1:46:04.460]  I don't work on my iPad that much anymore. But when I used to write things on my iPad, you know,
[1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:10.460]  I guess I would want it for maneuvering through tighter menus in office or whatever.
[1:46:11.900 --> 1:46:17.740]  Well, and a mouse cursor is way easier for, it's that place. Yep. And forgetting the insertion point
[1:46:17.740 --> 1:46:21.900]  right in the middle of the word between the two letters where you want to, you know, fix a typo or
[1:46:21.900 --> 1:46:26.220]  something like that. Right. But I don't know. It just seems to me like two different universes.
[1:46:26.220 --> 1:46:30.380]  But the other thing I hear from readers a lot is that they'll say stuff like, Hey, you know, it's
[1:46:30.380 --> 1:46:35.980]  funny. I never thought that I'd like a touchscreen Mac either, but I was on vacation, you know, for
[1:46:35.980 --> 1:46:40.940]  a week. And I didn't take my Mac. I only took my iPad. And I came back to work. And I, without
[1:46:40.940 --> 1:46:46.460]  thinking, found myself reaching out and touching my screen and expecting stuff to move. It's like,
[1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:51.820]  you know, yeah, I mean, that's a real thing. I do. I understand that. But it still seems to me
[1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:55.740]  like two different worlds. It does seem like two different worlds. But there are certain places,
[1:46:55.740 --> 1:47:00.460]  I think we're describing it where there are certain apps that we feel really comfortable reaching
[1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:06.460]  out and touching the screen. Then there are the certain apps where we feel way more comfortable
[1:47:06.460 --> 1:47:14.780]  using a keyboard and touchpad or a cursor. And that's, you know, Microsoft likes to give you that
[1:47:14.780 --> 1:47:24.540]  option. But of course, Microsoft designed the operating system around touch. Yeah. And I think
[1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:30.540]  I think that's what Apple says, you know, Apple says, you know, this operating system was just not
[1:47:31.420 --> 1:47:38.060]  designed for for touch. Right. And this other one is, right. And this other one is that said,
[1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:43.580]  I'm still, you know, I mean, and that's one of the problems that sometimes have with some of the
[1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:48.460]  keyboard docs for the iPad is like, you start to want to do more. And I wrote that piece a couple
[1:47:48.460 --> 1:47:53.180]  months ago. And we talked about it, which was like tablets for work that when you attach a keyboard
[1:47:53.180 --> 1:48:00.620]  to a tablet, you start to want to do more. And sometimes that wasn't designed for that. Right. Like
[1:48:00.620 --> 1:48:07.100]  if I attach a keyboard to my iPad, I start to want to be able to multitask better. I start to want
[1:48:07.100 --> 1:48:12.700]  to be able to type and do keyboard shortcuts and easily swipe up on the, on some sort of trackpad
[1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:21.980]  to get to something versus, you know, the opposite, which is, you know, when you're, when you don't
[1:48:21.980 --> 1:48:25.660]  have the keyboard, you, you sort of feel more limited, but you're not trying to do more.
[1:48:26.620 --> 1:48:30.140]  I think that about brings us to anything else you wanted to talk about this week, anything else
[1:48:30.140 --> 1:48:36.220]  on your mind? Anything else on my mind? I don't know. I've got an ice bucket challenge to do.
[1:48:36.220 --> 1:48:42.300]  Oh, I saw that. I've been, I've been, you know, I have to say I was for, you know, you're like sort
[1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:47.980]  of like, I'm the last person to be picked for the gym class team, you know, because I hadn't been
[1:48:47.980 --> 1:48:53.260]  tagged in the ice bucket challenge. But I also had like two weeks to sit back and watch it. I
[1:48:53.260 --> 1:48:58.460]  what I thought was very stupid videos. So I'm not really sure what I'm going to do with this.
[1:48:59.420 --> 1:49:05.340]  I saw something about that. This is this, I can't imagine there's anybody who hasn't seen this yet,
[1:49:05.340 --> 1:49:12.220]  but it's for ALS, the AKA Lou Gehrig disease. And I've seen some people and not people who are
[1:49:12.220 --> 1:49:18.140]  trying to be cynical, but people who are like, you know, is the point to raise money or those is
[1:49:18.140 --> 1:49:24.380]  the point to make these goofy videos. But I saw somebody say that they've raised like this,
[1:49:24.380 --> 1:49:28.700]  they do, it's like an annual campaign to raise money for ALS and that this year's campaign is
[1:49:28.700 --> 1:49:35.100]  something, it's already like 10 times more money than they raised in 2013. So it is,
[1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:41.260]  you know, it is in fact proving to be incredibly successful from their perspective as a fundraising
[1:49:41.260 --> 1:49:45.500]  thing. Well, the thing that really confused me, you know, early on in the week or was the end of
[1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:50.300]  last week, which was like, okay, the celebrities were getting in on the game. And, you know,
[1:49:50.300 --> 1:49:55.100]  from the start, from what I'd understood from Facebook videos that I'd watched for my friends,
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:49:59.980]  it was like either or, right? Either you dump this on your head or you give the money.
[1:49:59.980 --> 1:50:05.660]  Yeah, yeah. And I think that's what's what's making some people like, hey, shouldn't Tim Cook
[1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:10.140]  instead of dumping ice on his head, shouldn't he give the money? But he said that he gave the money.
[1:50:10.140 --> 1:50:14.140]  Yeah, I think what most people, I think everybody who cares enough to actually make a video and
[1:50:14.140 --> 1:50:18.940]  dump the ice water on their head is also giving money. And then I had tweeted last Friday or
[1:50:18.940 --> 1:50:25.820]  something like, why is no one dumping money on their head? And then finally of all people,
[1:50:25.820 --> 1:50:39.740]  what's his name, dump some money on his head? Charlie Sheen. So, you know, I guess I could dump
[1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:44.700]  money on my head, but I don't really have that much money. We're going to get 100 singles.
[1:50:44.700 --> 1:50:49.420]  Does anyone know a strip club I can go to? I'm sure somebody does. I think you could just go to the
[1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:57.180]  bank though. Okay, well, now I'm sharing too much. Yeah, I think that's all I have here to discuss.
[1:50:57.180 --> 1:51:02.540]  A bucket of ice, ice water singles. Yeah. Or then no one's done that.
[1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:11.020]  Wet money. Yeah, wet money. All right, well, thank you Joanna. Everybody can
[1:51:11.020 --> 1:51:20.140]  follow you on Twitter at at Joanna Stern and everybody can read your weekly columns and watch your
[1:51:20.140 --> 1:51:27.100]  excellent excellent videos at the Wall Street Journal. Thank you. Yes. Is there a special special URL or
[1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:37.820]  just like what's the homepage of the? W s J D dot com. W s J D dot com. Yeah, really. And great
[1:51:37.820 --> 1:51:41.980]  where the videos are my favorite part. I don't know. I'm glad to hear that. Yeah, no, we put a lot of
[1:51:41.980 --> 1:51:46.700]  effort into those. So yeah, I do think that's weird. You know, I was thinking about that before I cut
[1:51:46.700 --> 1:51:54.060]  your short. I before I cut the show. I do think it's weird and you're at the center of it of the way
[1:51:54.060 --> 1:52:00.860]  that the established publicate or not even publication media brands. There's this incredible
[1:52:00.860 --> 1:52:06.620]  convergence between writing and TV. Yeah, it used to be totally different. I mean, because you're
[1:52:06.620 --> 1:52:11.900]  pre prior gig to the Wall Street Journal was ABC. I mean, which is as, you know, old school TV as
[1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:19.740]  you can get, right. But the video work, you know, in the verge certainly raised the bar on the
[1:52:19.740 --> 1:52:23.900]  quality of that. And you were there at the outset, you know, when they started that, but they
[1:52:23.900 --> 1:52:30.620]  they really raised the bar on the quality of the video work that that went along with print or not
[1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:35.740]  print, but written stuff that was, you know, detailed in as long as it ever was. But there's this
[1:52:35.740 --> 1:52:41.500]  incredible convergence going on. And I feel like I'm left behind on that. Well, you can put video on
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:47.740]  your site. I could. I don't know. I guess I'm making up for it with podcasts. Right. Yeah. I mean,
[1:52:47.740 --> 1:52:52.700]  you know, and it's not something I feel like I have figured out in every week, I'm trying to try
[1:52:52.700 --> 1:52:57.260]  new things though. There's, you know, obviously restrictions on time and, you know, how long people
[1:52:57.260 --> 1:53:01.260]  will watch a video for and what kind of things are more visual than what you can put into print.
[1:53:01.260 --> 1:53:06.540]  I mean, it's, I don't think anyone's really mastered it yet. Um, but it's a fun time to play around
[1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:11.420]  with it for sure. Um, and they're letting me do some fun stuff. So I'm okay with it. Well,
[1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:16.060]  and the production value is just excellent. I mean, it doesn't seem like, oh, here's newspaper
[1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:22.540]  people doing video. It's, you know, top tier. This could be on any TV broadcast quality video.
[1:53:22.540 --> 1:53:28.140]  Yeah. My, my producer, um, Drew Evans, who will never listen to this because he, well,
[1:53:28.140 --> 1:53:31.740]  maybe he will, maybe we'll get him to listen to this. I'm trying to get him on Twitter. Um,
[1:53:31.740 --> 1:53:37.740]  but he's, he's amazing. He's really, really good. He's right. There's no, you know, no compromise,
[1:53:37.740 --> 1:53:42.540]  no, well, we're just doing a video as an extra type thing. It's, you know, we expect this to be as
[1:53:42.540 --> 1:53:46.380]  excellent as the writing, which, you know, in the Wall Street Journal has always been known for,
[1:53:47.340 --> 1:53:53.420]  uh, you know, just, you know, no holds barred excellent writing quality. Yeah. I mean, he's,
[1:53:53.420 --> 1:53:59.900]  he's amazing. And I mean, it's, it's fun to be able to have a producer and the producer with
[1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:03.660]  skills that can actually kind of just make certain things happen, which is really cool too.
[1:54:04.460 --> 1:54:11.900]  Um, yeah. So, well, keep up the good work. Thank you very much. W s j d dot com and, uh, hopefully
[1:54:11.900 --> 1:54:16.060]  I'll see you in a couple of weeks. You mean, for, for my big day, which is the iPhone launch, right?
[1:54:16.780 --> 1:54:21.100]  Exactly. The most important thing going on for you in September. And then followed by the launch
[1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:27.180]  of the square blackberry. Exactly. All right. God, I hope you have one of those with you.
[1:54:28.140 --> 1:54:32.380]  Oh, that would be amazing. Oh, my God. Or maybe I'll just turn down, you know, I don't know if
[1:54:32.380 --> 1:54:36.620]  I'll be invited to the Apple event. But if I am invited, you know, maybe I'll have to turn it down
[1:54:36.620 --> 1:54:41.340]  if there's a blackberry about that day. That would be, that would be just like blackberry,
[1:54:41.340 --> 1:54:54.780]  just schedule it on the same day. Oh, totally. Totally.
