[00:00.000 --> 00:05.200]  René, I feel like before we get to yesterday's event, which was, am I correct? Was that yesterday?
[00:06.800 --> 00:10.160]  Yes, I think I had to do I had to look at the calendar. But yes, it was.
[00:10.160 --> 00:16.160]  Before we get there, which I haven't done a show since last week when the Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers
[00:16.160 --> 00:20.640]  issued a ruling in the epic Apple case. And I do not want to spend a lot of time on this because
[00:20.640 --> 00:27.040]  I do not have a lot of insight to add. But I will say that the very most curious thing about it is
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.560]  how incredibly wide ranging the interpretations of the injunction against Apple are.
[00:34.160 --> 00:35.760]  From the companies and from the pundits.
[00:36.400 --> 00:40.480]  So it's a short one page injunction. It's that that whole thing about,
[00:40.480 --> 00:42.880]  you know, blah, blah, blah, and metadata buttons.
[00:44.640 --> 00:48.320]  People aren't quite sure what the hell a metadata button is, which isn't what she meant.
[00:48.320 --> 00:58.800]  No. There's the I guess on the one side is I will throw Nilay Patel under the bus and he's,
[00:59.520 --> 01:05.280]  he had a piece of The Verge with a sort of maximalist interpretation of it,
[01:05.280 --> 01:12.000]  which is that if you're if they're not, if Apple is no longer allowed to prohibit companies from
[01:12.000 --> 01:21.680]  directing users to external payment methods with buttons, then the button that they're not allowed
[01:21.680 --> 01:27.040]  to prohibit could be an in app payment button that processes credit cards right in the app,
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.320]  which if you only look at the injunction isn't crazy at all. I know Nilay is he's a friend. He's
[01:34.320 --> 01:42.560]  a frequent guest on the show. He's also former attorney. You know, I happen to think, though,
[01:42.560 --> 01:47.440]  that he's all wet on this interpretation. And again, the injunction taken of it by itself,
[01:47.440 --> 01:55.200]  the one page injunction, very ambiguously worded, really kind of odd. But it was delivered as part
[01:55.200 --> 02:01.360]  and parcel with the 158 page, I believe ruling. Yeah, which is a good read. Did you read it?
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.520]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I got more I skimmed it more than read it. But I think I got all the
[02:05.520 --> 02:10.240]  salient points. I always think I'm going to read these things. And then I do you have to skim at
[02:10.240 --> 02:15.920]  some point, but it's it is very good. And I think you know, I know that it's sort of like file this
[02:15.920 --> 02:26.160]  under duh. But it is a very good and fair and comprehensive overview of the whole debate. The
[02:26.160 --> 02:31.520]  whole thing about the whole way the app Apple's App Store works. All of epics various complaints
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.280]  about the way that the App Store actually works. It is a terrific layperson's overview.
[02:38.480 --> 02:44.880]  Comprehensive, fair, accurate, very well organized to which is, you know, and you know what that's
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.680]  like, you know, writing scripts for videos and writing articles. I mean, 158 pages,
[02:51.680 --> 02:57.680]  effectively, it's a small book. It's very well organized, which is very difficult. But I think
[02:57.680 --> 03:03.600]  when you read the ruling, it's very and having followed along with the trial. And again, I didn't
[03:03.600 --> 03:08.160]  watch the trial every day, because that just seemed like madness. But watching the reading
[03:08.160 --> 03:16.000]  the nightly recaps back in May. It was very, very clear that she was casting a legal stink eye on
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.080]  Apple's anti steering provisions. Yes, specific. Yes. She was really smart, like Judge Gonzalez,
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.680]  she's sort of what you hope for you always have these nightmares that you're going to get a
[03:27.680 --> 03:30.800]  completely tech illiterate judge is not going to know what they're doing and make sort of
[03:30.800 --> 03:35.120]  arbitrary decisions that are terrible for everybody. But throughout the entire trial
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.880]  from the way she threw shade at the lawyers at the witnesses at everybody and sort of drove into the
[03:40.880 --> 03:46.400]  heart of every matter I thought was very impressive. Yeah, so I you know, and I think this controversy
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.000]  over metadata buttons here is the phrase I have it now in front of me, they're permanently
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.120]  restrained and enjoined does Apple from prohibiting developers from one other calls,
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.680]  including in their apps and their metadata. I think there should be like a colon there like
[04:03.680 --> 04:11.040]  an implied colon in their apps and their metadata colon buttons, external links or other calls to
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.120]  action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms in addition to in app purchasing,
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.760]  which is capitalized. And she says in a footnote elsewhere, that capitalized in app purchasing is
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.600]  Apple's IAP system. Yeah. And to communicating with customers through points of contact obtained
[04:29.600 --> 04:34.800]  voluntarily. In other words, they can email customers if they get permission to have their
[04:34.800 --> 04:40.240]  email, which, again, clearly using Apple's App Store guidelines as the basis for that phrasing.
[04:40.240 --> 04:47.120]  Right. My interpretation of this, again, I'm not a lawyer, but in the context of the ruling is it
[04:47.120 --> 04:55.680]  is just steering provisions. And so yes, if it comes to pass in this in Apple doesn't appeal
[04:55.680 --> 05:05.040]  this and it comes into action, it would allow any and all apps to tell users, hey, in addition to
[05:05.040 --> 05:11.840]  our in app purchasing, which goes through Apple and Apple gets their 30% or 15%, you could go to
[05:11.840 --> 05:20.000]  our website and sign up for 999 instead of 1299 or whatever the price difference may be. Or even
[05:20.000 --> 05:26.640]  if it's a game like the Fortnite technique would be not that you can do what they did.
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.600]  Like Nilay is saying Nilay's argument is that like what Fortnite did would now be legal because
[05:31.600 --> 05:35.600]  Fortnite if for people who don't remember this seems you know, it was only up for a couple days
[05:35.600 --> 05:41.280]  it was easy to miss. But Fortnite didn't replace in app purchasing with their own purchasing system.
[05:41.280 --> 05:49.280]  They left them both in it with the so called hotfix you know, paying that enabled this version
[05:49.280 --> 05:55.040]  of Fortnite. And specifically, they did that because they wanted to prove the point that
[05:55.040 --> 06:03.280]  given the choice, many users would choose to save 20% by using epics own payment processing
[06:03.280 --> 06:08.960]  instead of apples processing. Part of their stunt was to put them side by side not to
[06:08.960 --> 06:13.360]  completely remove apples in app purchasing and replace it with their own. But that I
[06:13.360 --> 06:16.080]  believe would still not be allowed under this injunction.
[06:16.080 --> 06:22.080]  It's going to be interesting to see because epic has already appealed and a lot of this
[06:22.080 --> 06:26.080]  is going to be tested whether it's right or wrong people test different scenarios. And
[06:26.080 --> 06:29.760]  it also is an American ruling and apples and international customer and we saw how they
[06:29.760 --> 06:34.640]  reacted to the Japanese the previous Japanese ruling but by making a sort of a global change,
[06:34.640 --> 06:39.680]  but we haven't seen any indication of how they'll respond to this. But my favorite summation of all
[06:39.680 --> 06:44.960]  of this was early on it was Stephen Warwick who was covering it for iMore and future for months
[06:44.960 --> 06:49.760]  and he just said, to sum up epic games is one after being defeated in court, Apple be forced
[06:49.760 --> 06:53.760]  to make massive sweeping get very minor changes that will change absolutely everything and yet
[06:53.760 --> 06:57.920]  nothing for developers and will cost the company it's huge App Store cash cow that is actually
[06:57.920 --> 07:02.000]  very tiny. Epic Games plans to appeal against this victory and Apple has welcomed the courts
[07:02.000 --> 07:02.800]  ruling against it.
[07:02.800 --> 07:08.080]  John Greenewald That is pretty good. I have to have to add that to the show notes. Was
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.440]  that a tweet? Did he get that all in?
[07:09.440 --> 07:16.240]  Trenton Larkin Yes. Yeah, two tweets. That's actually pretty good for a tweet. I do think
[07:16.240 --> 07:21.040]  if Nilay is correct, then this is far more sweeping than we're thinking. It's also with
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.080]  certainty far more sweeping than Apple is thinking. I was part of a press event press
[07:26.080 --> 07:32.480]  call Friday afternoon after this was, you know, on bet there was an on the on the record statement
[07:32.480 --> 07:41.040]  from Kate Adams, the chief legal officer at Apple. And then a fairly substantial Q&A period
[07:42.160 --> 07:48.240]  that was off the record on background with people from Apple and they clearly see that
[07:48.960 --> 07:54.960]  see this as steering only. Yes. And you know, and people and I think some of the reaction
[07:54.960 --> 08:02.960]  out there is like, like me tweeting that and a few other media people who were on the call
[08:02.960 --> 08:07.360]  tweeting that just saying not saying, you know, this is my legal opinion, just Apple
[08:07.360 --> 08:12.000]  doesn't think that that's what it means. The knee jerk reaction against that was well,
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.160]  of course, Apple's going to spin it their way. But there's I don't understand what the
[08:18.160 --> 08:26.240]  thinking is there because it's not like they're going to spin Judge Gonzalez Rogers, right? Like,
[08:26.240 --> 08:31.760]  if Judge Gonzalez Rogers really meant you have to allow all third party apps to do their own
[08:31.760 --> 08:39.200]  payment processing in app for digital goods purchased in the app. Apple telling the press
[08:39.920 --> 08:44.960]  the day that the ruling came out that that's not how they see it, not only doesn't help them at
[08:44.960 --> 08:54.400]  all, it hurts them. Because if they're trying to set expectations for, let's just say investors,
[08:54.400 --> 09:01.520]  right, it does no good for them to have, let's say, an eight week period, initially after the
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.760]  ruling where people like, oh, it only means anti steering, because that's what Apple thinks.
[09:05.760 --> 09:10.480]  And then, you know, they go to get clarification before Gonzalez Rogers, and she's like, no,
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.560]  no, I meant something else entirely, which is much worse for the company. Well, then that's,
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.040]  that's bad for Apple. This does, there is no, there is no advantage to spinning this
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.440]  in any way. The judge won't care what Twitter's hot takes are, right? Not one little bit.
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.920]  The other thing that I thought was very telling was that Epic, Epic's lawyers and CEO Tim Sweeney
[09:31.920 --> 09:36.800]  interpreted it the exact same way as Apple too, that they got their pants taken from them on
[09:36.800 --> 09:42.480]  every single issue except the steering, which Epic itself didn't really care about. Like,
[09:42.480 --> 09:48.480]  I don't think being able to tell people, I think it's better than nothing, you know, from Epic or
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.400]  any other game makers perspective to say, you can go to epic.com or Fortnite.com, whatever their
[09:54.400 --> 10:00.960]  website is, and buy V bucks there at a lower price. But if you can't process them in the game,
[10:00.960 --> 10:04.880]  you remove the ability to, let's be frank, impulse purchases, right?
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.840]  Right. And they also didn't say anything about the, a lot of these hot takes didn't address the
[10:09.840 --> 10:13.520]  previous part about, well, Tim Cook said it, but the judge also didn't say anything about Apple
[10:13.520 --> 10:17.600]  not being able to collect commissions, whether you're using your own in-app purchase or even
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.080]  collecting money outside the app store. None of that was, it was specifically ruled out by this
[10:22.080 --> 10:29.600]  either. Right. And that was a curious part of Tim Cook's testimony, which I don't think went very
[10:29.600 --> 10:36.640]  well, to be honest, but maybe went well legally. I think publicity wise, it went pretty poorly,
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.240]  maybe legally wise, he made good points. And he obviously was sticking to a script of
[10:43.600 --> 10:49.040]  a talking point about the legal right of a company, even if they have a monopoly and
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.360]  are deemed to have a monopoly, they still have a right to profit from their own intellectual
[10:53.360 --> 11:00.720]  property, which he emphasized over and over again. And that to me gets to the core of what Apple was
[11:00.720 --> 11:06.800]  concerned about and why Apple posited this as a resounding victory is that Apple, I think,
[11:06.800 --> 11:15.040]  was most concerned about being deemed a monopoly. And that changes, again, monopolies aren't illegal,
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.000]  but then all of a sudden the laws, that's the big lesson I remember learning 20 some years ago from
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.720]  the Microsoft case. You grow up thinking monopolies are illegal or something, or just plain bad,
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.760]  but it's just a different set of laws apply when you're deemed to have a monopoly. And it's very
[11:31.760 --> 11:37.360]  clear that that was what Apple was concerned about. And their initial statements about this
[11:37.360 --> 11:44.720]  were about how she very clearly said that this is not a monopoly under state or federal law in
[11:44.720 --> 11:51.040]  California. And the Japan Fair Trade Commission thing said the same thing, that other than this
[11:51.040 --> 11:56.160]  issues of anti-steering provisions for quote unquote reader apps, we don't see anything that's
[11:56.160 --> 12:00.800]  a monopolist or anti-competitive behavior at Apple. And she clearly drew her own market
[12:00.800 --> 12:04.400]  definition, which I thought was great, too, because the other ones were way too far in
[12:04.400 --> 12:11.040]  either extreme. Yeah, yeah. And she said for the purposes of this case, that the market was,
[12:11.680 --> 12:15.760]  wait, actually, I forget what it was, mobile gaming? Yeah, mobile gaming. Yeah. Which applies
[12:15.760 --> 12:19.360]  definitely to Android. Does it apply to the Switch? Like a lot of this is very curious to me.
[12:19.360 --> 12:22.400]  Yeah, I think it does apply to the Switch because she was the one, remember, she's the one who
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.880]  brought it up where it was something with, you know, she like embarrassed one of Epic's lawyers
[12:26.880 --> 12:30.400]  at one point during the thing where she was like, yeah, but I could play on my Switch on the, you
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.880]  know, he's like, you can't play the PC version of Fortnite while you're on the bus. And she goes,
[12:34.880 --> 12:37.280]  well, I can play it on the Switch. And he was like, Oh, yes.
[12:38.640 --> 12:40.560]  Yeah, he was rather battered and abused.
[12:41.520 --> 12:44.640]  So we shall see. And the reason I don't want to belabor this too much is I,
[12:45.280 --> 12:49.920]  there's no point, right? It's like, we'll find out soon enough. But I do think it's very instructive
[12:49.920 --> 12:54.400]  that Epic's lawyers interpreted it the same way that Apple's did, which was that they lost
[12:54.400 --> 13:01.760]  everything except the anti steering, not in app purchases. And it is why they're feeling right.
[13:03.280 --> 13:07.760]  And the argument that well, of course, Apple's going to spin it in the most favorable way for
[13:07.760 --> 13:13.360]  Apple. Well, then wouldn't those same people think epic would spin it in the most beneficial way to
[13:13.360 --> 13:18.160]  epic? No, they spun it the exact same way, which was that the only thing that should change if the
[13:18.160 --> 13:23.600]  injunction stands is the anti searing stuff, which is the number one point I've been hammering for
[13:23.600 --> 13:27.440]  years about the App Store. Yeah, and what's interesting to me too, is that I think a lot
[13:27.440 --> 13:32.160]  of times we get trapped in the 10% of Twitter, which is very, very loud, but it's not at all
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.400]  representative of any mainstream sentiment at all. Even when you talk about developers,
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.120]  even indie developers that we know, they're not a uni mine. You see a whole bunch of different
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.200]  reactions from people who really want sideloading to developers who think it's going to increase
[13:45.200 --> 13:48.240]  piracy to people who really want alternate payments to people who think it's going to
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.120]  increase fraud. They see different value propositions in the App Store and by no means
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.960]  were they all aligned behind Tim epic or Spotify or DHH or any of the people who I consider much
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.240]  more like online firebrands around some of this. And when you look at customers, we just we really
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.320]  care about the experience. It doesn't matter what epic thinks or what Apple thinks. I'm not going
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.120]  to be happy to like and easily buy my comic books and ebooks and everything else with one button
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.720]  tap and iOS because everything else is just a crappy experience. I do think I know that the
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.000]  epic thing is more fireworksy because there's lots, you know, we have this debate over just
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  what the injunction means and the and the difference in interpretation is not subtle.
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.560]  That's it's a very significant difference. I think though, that if you take the drama away,
[14:36.560 --> 14:41.840]  what Apple did with the Japan Fair Trade Commission is more interesting. And it was a
[14:41.840 --> 14:48.000]  no drama thing. There was very little publicity. It seemed mutually respectful on both sides.
[14:48.880 --> 14:53.760]  I've said this, I said this on dithering, that I thought Phil Schiller statement in the press
[14:53.760 --> 14:59.040]  release announcing it was was very interesting and super respectful of the process. And I think
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.800]  that what Apple and Schiller truly appreciated is that it was no drama and the Japan Fair Trade
[15:04.800 --> 15:14.960]  Commission was very serious and it's very serious business. But it it the fact is Apple agreed to
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.480]  bend on something and you can argue that making it only for quote unquote reader apps, which is
[15:20.480 --> 15:28.640]  sort of an arbitrary category that Apple defines. It still is significant to me because it's the
[15:28.640 --> 15:35.280]  first time Apple's bent in that direction at all. It's the first sign we have that Apple is like,
[15:35.280 --> 15:43.200]  hey, maybe we should backtrack a little bit on on the maximalist perspective of how much money
[15:43.840 --> 15:48.480]  and rent we can seek from in app purchasing and subscriptions in the App Store.
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.600]  Yeah, absolutely. And I think again, like they're playing the long game on all of this. And it
[15:55.600 --> 16:00.400]  really is, I don't want to dunk on V bucks because they have zero marginal cost. And people just
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.280]  throw money at them. It's a fortune with that returns almost no value, except for some enjoyment
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.120]  at the time. But that's where all the money is. That's where all the money is for Apple. And
[16:09.120 --> 16:13.760]  that's why Google regulates games on on the Play Store in the exact same way that Apple does on
[16:13.760 --> 16:18.960]  iOS. And that's the part that I think is going to get not not reader apps, like for books, or for
[16:18.960 --> 16:22.400]  movies, or for all those things. But games is going to be the big financial battleground.
[16:22.400 --> 16:27.920]  Right. And they're already not making a cent from Netflix anymore, other than old grandfathered
[16:27.920 --> 16:32.960]  accounts that didn't sign up. I mean, but people forget that when in the early days, Netflix was
[16:32.960 --> 16:37.920]  allowing people to sign up through in app purchasing subscriptions. And Apple at the time
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.440]  was publishing like top earning apps lists, stuff that they've gotten away from, I think for
[16:43.440 --> 16:47.520]  competitive reasons, you know that they don't want to let people know who's who's making the most
[16:47.520 --> 16:56.720]  money. But for years, Netflix was the top grossing app in the App Store. And then even after Netflix
[16:56.720 --> 17:02.560]  stopped taking signups, they still were because of all the users who were already in on that system
[17:02.560 --> 17:09.840]  paying 15% to Netflix. We take them for a nebula. Now you can you can buy a nebula subscription in
[17:09.840 --> 17:18.480]  app on iOS. There you go. It's it lots of people do it. It's advantageous to a certain to a certain
[17:18.480 --> 17:23.040]  class of customer, they value the convenience of it, having all their subscriptions in one place,
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.960]  being able to easily terminate subscriptions, which is not always the case with New York Times
[17:26.960 --> 17:31.920]  or Washington Post or Wall Street Journal, those things. So it has it adds value for some people.
[17:31.920 --> 17:36.240]  Right. But let's say take Kindle, for example, Apple doesn't make any money from Kindle,
[17:36.240 --> 17:40.800]  they haven't, you know, very early on for like a year or so Kindle was able to have like a web view
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.720]  in their app, and people could buy books in the Kindle. And Apple, I think because Apple had
[17:46.720 --> 17:56.160]  approached the whole App Store from a TV and a video and music store viewpoint, where you buy
[17:56.960 --> 18:03.120]  shows and movies and songs and albums, and you download them and you can use them.
[18:03.120 --> 18:10.960]  And that is sort of also the traditional way of buying apps and games, right? Did you say this
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.480]  game is $4.99, you pay $4.99, and then you download it, and then it's yours to keep and you
[18:16.480 --> 18:23.840]  play it. And they just hadn't foreseen the rise of in app purchasing and subscriptions and how
[18:23.840 --> 18:30.240]  different it made the App Store than the iTunes store. But
[18:30.240 --> 18:35.120]  Well, all those reader apps are aggregators, like they aggregate comic books or books or music or
[18:35.120 --> 18:39.200]  something, but then the App Store aggregates apps as all the App Store is is a major aggregator.
[18:39.200 --> 18:42.800]  And there's very little room in the profit margin for two aggregators for digital goods.
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.520]  Right. So they're already not making money from Kindle because you can't buy Kindle apps. And so
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.400]  if Kindle can just link out and send you, you know, maybe you have to leave the app and go to Safari,
[18:52.400 --> 18:57.200]  but you can quick buy, you know, buy stuff. And it'll have like a callback URL that will take
[18:57.200 --> 19:02.080]  you back to where you were in the app or something like that. That's it. It's all meaningless,
[19:02.080 --> 19:08.000]  honestly, it's not going to materially affect Apple's finances at all. The game stuff would
[19:08.000 --> 19:11.520]  I mean, the and what that was some of the interesting stuff from the trial is from the
[19:11.520 --> 19:21.440]  findings of fact that 70% of Apple's revenue on the App Store is games. And 98% of in app purchases
[19:21.440 --> 19:27.360]  are for games, which I think and I've said that it only makes sense if that's literally in app
[19:27.360 --> 19:35.040]  purchases, not subscriptions, you know, like a one time loot box or an emote or whatever they call
[19:35.040 --> 19:42.880]  the things in Fortnite, you know, you spend five bucks, get a new costume. 98% are games, but then
[19:42.880 --> 19:47.360]  I think like, well, what else can you buy in app purchase? I mean, I know that there are, you know,
[19:47.360 --> 19:51.600]  Jay Haynes Yeah, no, that's it. Like, we found out early on with the App Store that people would
[19:51.600 --> 19:56.560]  not pay $5 for a game, but they would pay 50 bucks to have a nicer looking farm, or to get their f1
[19:56.560 --> 20:01.200]  racer back on the track faster. We'll pay for instant and ego gratification. And that's it.
[20:01.200 --> 20:05.760]  And they've turned into massive casino like businesses to harvest all of that from us.
[20:05.760 --> 20:10.000]  Yeah, it's amazing. And the Fortnite, you know, the other thing from the the court case and just
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.960]  seeing epics financials, they, you know, clearly, they're they struck gold with the idea of
[20:14.960 --> 20:20.720]  Fortnite. I mean, it's in hindsight, it's kind of nutty to make a triple A caliber game that you
[20:20.720 --> 20:28.320]  just let everybody download and play for free. And kudos to them for the fact that it wasn't
[20:28.320 --> 20:34.960]  pay to win, right? You could if you if you're a kid with no money, you get your no competitive
[20:34.960 --> 20:40.240]  disadvantage to playing against an adult with a full time job who can spend whatever they want
[20:40.240 --> 20:45.760]  on stuff. All they get are costumes and dance moves competitively. You're completely on even
[20:45.760 --> 20:52.320]  ground. And it turns out that super lucrative like I think that the I think I'm not a gaming expert,
[20:52.320 --> 20:59.120]  but I feel like in the early days of in app purchases, it was pay to win. And pay to just
[20:59.120 --> 21:05.120]  look good is actually Yeah, more lucrative. Yeah, no, absolutely. The only the only thing
[21:05.120 --> 21:08.720]  I want to take a little bit away from Fortnite there. I mean, they definitely packaged it really
[21:08.720 --> 21:12.640]  well. And they're very good at making partnerships with Marvel and Star Wars and things like that.
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.000]  But they had a game and then they saw pub G and they integrated all of that into their game was
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.800]  very successful. Now they just integrated among us into their game. Very successful, but you know,
[21:22.800 --> 21:27.120]  to complete didn't didn't even bother to talk to the indie developer. And they famously just
[21:27.120 --> 21:31.600]  straight up stole a bunch of dance moves in the beginning. Now they have creator agreements, but
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.400]  they for someone who takes the moral high ground as often as Tim epic there. They were built on a
[21:36.400 --> 21:45.920]  lot of external ideas. Right? That's a lot lots of copying versus rip off is in the eye of the
[21:45.920 --> 21:51.680]  beholder all around. Yeah. Well, they didn't copy forward. I think it's like the goal of everything.
[21:51.680 --> 21:55.600]  They're more like copy paste. Right. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first

[23:28.000 --> 23:35.600]  yesterday, California streaming. What'd you think? You know, I think it was good. I liked that they
[23:35.600 --> 23:40.160]  actually took it outside of Apple park because after, you know, to use your term two seasons
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.080]  or at least one and a half seasons of the Apple event show, it was nice to see them go outside
[23:44.080 --> 23:50.800]  for a, for a minute. I think that was the thinking. I know a lot of people like what is with all this
[23:50.800 --> 23:56.400]  pro California stuff. It's like, it was almost like the opening was like a promotional video
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.520]  for the state of California tourism board. It was beautiful undeniably, but does it,
[24:01.520 --> 24:07.760]  did it belong in an Apple event? And I kind of feel like I don't really feel it served any other
[24:07.760 --> 24:15.840]  strategic point other than they wanted a theme for this episode of the show and they wanted,
[24:15.840 --> 24:23.120]  you know, they, I honestly, I think everybody's surprised at this point. It, that, that there's,
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.480]  that we're still in a situation where these things have to be virtual. Yeah. You know,
[24:28.480 --> 24:33.840]  certainly the way things were looking up in May and June, it seemed likely to me at that point
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.120]  that, that we might be back to regular in-person events by September. Obviously the Delta variant
[24:39.120 --> 24:46.960]  had other things to say as well as vaccine resistance for lack of a better term. Resistance,
[24:46.960 --> 24:54.320]  like political resistance, not medical resistance. And they needed a theme. I think you're right.
[24:54.320 --> 25:04.080]  You know, they've kind of used up Apple park as a backdrop. So get out, go around the state and
[25:04.080 --> 25:10.800]  shoot in pretty areas. I thought that the the Cayenne Drant segment for, for the introduction
[25:10.800 --> 25:18.000]  of the iPhone 13 and 13 mini in particular was amazing at the turns out that's the San Diego
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.200]  symphony. They're outdoor. I guess you call it an amphitheater. Yeah. But I thought the thing that
[25:25.200 --> 25:31.440]  number one, it was striking. It's a very beautiful outdoor theater, but I also thought that it struck
[25:31.440 --> 25:38.000]  the perfect balance of being an attractive cinematic backdrop for Cayenne Drants to
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.680]  introduce these two phones, but also the thousands of empty seats in front of her and her being alone
[25:45.680 --> 25:52.480]  on stage emphasize the, we get it. We're still in weird times and we can't have thousands of people
[25:53.520 --> 25:58.160]  see this live. Yeah. And it was also kind of interesting to have it all centered around
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.640]  California the same day as the recall election was happening in California. Yeah, that was
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.040]  interesting because California really was in the news. And I thought, did they think about that
[26:07.040 --> 26:10.480]  or no? It doesn't seem like something Apple would think about, but it also doesn't seem like
[26:10.480 --> 26:14.800]  something Apple would be ignorant of. Everybody knew this recall election was coming up and the
[26:14.800 --> 26:21.680]  date has been sent for months. I think that the unlikelihood of that is that it was, it turns out
[26:21.680 --> 26:28.800]  that the recall was a big failure and Governor Gavin Newsom held on by any count a landslide.
[26:29.360 --> 26:34.240]  But that wasn't so clear in the polling leading up. I mean, in the last couple of weeks,
[26:34.240 --> 26:41.600]  it seemed pretty clear and the polling was sort of held back by one goofy poll a couple months ago
[26:41.600 --> 26:47.280]  that really skewed the average of polls. But it doesn't seem like something Apple would want to
[26:47.280 --> 26:51.840]  bet on. Right? Like, you know, politics, absolutely. Politics are funny nowadays,
[26:51.840 --> 26:59.600]  things happen fast. So I don't know. I thought that was interesting. What else? High level
[26:59.600 --> 27:05.520]  overview? Well, I mean, this, this is their big event. And last year, they couldn't do the iPhone
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.040]  in September, they had to hold off till October. So we famously got Apple Watch and iPad. And going
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.280]  into this, it was sort of unclear. I mean, a lot of people thought it was going to be Apple iPhone
[27:15.280 --> 27:20.480]  and Apple Watch, but Apple's done iPads, at least the base level iPad for the last few September's
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.040]  in a row. So I think they've gotten a really good package of things together. And I was just left
[27:25.040 --> 27:28.800]  to wonder, you know, we have Macs in October, I'm sort of going through and checking things off the
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.600]  list to see what's still on the list. Right. But I like the way that they move the little cards
[27:33.600 --> 27:37.360]  around to plan out this event. I thought it ended up being a really solid hour and a bit.
[27:38.240 --> 27:43.600]  What is left on the list? Macs? Obviously, we still have a whole bunch of Macs that have never
[27:43.600 --> 27:50.000]  moved to Apple Silicon. We have the, you know, just what does that mean? Apple Silicon wise?
[27:50.000 --> 27:57.280]  A, what like would a Apple Silicon MacBook Pro, 16 inch MacBook Pro look like? Who knows? Maybe
[27:57.280 --> 28:03.680]  iMac Pros too? You know, 27. Who knows what else is on the agenda for the rest of the year. But
[28:03.680 --> 28:10.240]  also, you know, are are we going to see M2 chips, M1x chips? What is the Silicon? What is the actual
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.240]  Silicon story? Something has to get so confused. Like people get so confused with that. And they
[28:16.240 --> 28:22.000]  think that Apple can't announce like an M1x after the A15 comes out. And this is the same Apple
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.200]  that announced an A12z iPad Pro after A13 shipped. Right. None of the stuff works. I think the way
[28:27.200 --> 28:33.280]  that people presume it does. So like the M1x just means more cores and extended core version of the
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.640]  M1 where M2 isn't going to be like per core, it'll be more powerful, but it won't have anywhere
[28:38.640 --> 28:43.760]  nearly the amount of cores. So that'll be like the new MacBook Air chip. And then M1x will be the
[28:43.760 --> 28:49.280]  Pro chip. And it will be an M2x eventually if Apple sticks to pattern. Yeah, so we'll see.
[28:49.280 --> 28:54.640]  That's definitely coming. I guess people have been thinking that there'd be updated AirPods 3.
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.440]  I think a lot of people thought they would come yesterday. Meaning the room according to the
[28:59.440 --> 29:03.920]  rumor. And you know, we can get into this. But you know, yes, maybe you don't want to take too
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.760]  much stock in according to the rumors this year. But according to the rumors, they would be new,
[29:10.560 --> 29:20.480]  no adjective AirPods that look more like the AirPods Pro. Don't have noise canceling,
[29:20.480 --> 29:28.560]  but do have a more compact, shorter stemmed appearance. That's obviously the sort of product
[29:28.560 --> 29:35.920]  that's not going to be a tent pole in an event. But it's also the sort of product that is either
[29:35.920 --> 29:41.760]  to me either going to make it in time for the holiday season or forget it. Let's do it in
[29:41.760 --> 29:46.640]  January or February. Let's go into the holiday season with the AirPods that we already have
[29:47.280 --> 29:51.360]  and know how to make and sell in massive quantities because that's, you know,
[29:51.360 --> 29:58.320]  that's just a humongous stocking stuffer type present. So there's no, you know,
[29:58.320 --> 30:01.520]  correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think AirPods have been in a keynote since the original,
[30:01.520 --> 30:06.720]  like the AirPods 2, AirPods Pro. I don't even think AirPods Max where any of those were in
[30:06.720 --> 30:11.760]  a keynote. Yeah, I don't think so. So it might just be a Mac only event because I don't think
[30:11.760 --> 30:17.680]  they're going to update the, they already updated the iPad Pros earlier in the year.
[30:17.680 --> 30:22.960]  I don't think any of the other iPads are long in the tooth, right? The iPad Air is still pretty
[30:22.960 --> 30:28.240]  fresh with the home, you know, touch ID on the home button that the iPad Mini is sort of
[30:28.240 --> 30:33.280]  following in the footsteps of. So what else even is there? It's, you know, maybe so I'm thinking
[30:33.280 --> 30:39.600]  in October Mac event, maybe they tuck in AirPods or something like that. Because they do stuff like
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.640]  that. Like they'll, they'll have like, remember last year when they did the HomePod Minis as a
[30:44.640 --> 30:51.200]  sort of like a segment of the show. But they did a whole event last November with three with the
[30:51.200 --> 30:56.320]  iMac, the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini, telling the M1 story, of course, but they'll tell
[30:56.320 --> 31:00.640]  the M1X story. And then they'll have these 14 inch, the 16 inch and you know, that's, that's
[31:00.640 --> 31:06.240]  a pretty decent event. Yeah, maybe the M1X Mac Mini. Yeah, something like that. Who knows? You
[31:06.240 --> 31:12.720]  know, but in the meantime, we've got what was announced yesterday. Yeah, I think we've got
[31:12.720 --> 31:18.320]  announced yesterday. I thought that the other thing at a higher level, you know, Tim Cook
[31:18.320 --> 31:26.320]  opened up and the first thing that was mentioned was the the fall TV Plus schedule. And to me,
[31:26.320 --> 31:36.560]  TV Plus is, is a lot like Apple Watch, where it's like the, when Apple Watch first came out,
[31:36.560 --> 31:42.000]  people, so many people were like, well, this is a dud. This isn't selling well. This is not,
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.200]  this is, you know, they can't make new products without Steve Jobs. This is why everybody said
[31:47.200 --> 31:55.040]  we were right. Steve Jobs is irreplaceable. And then like a year or two goes by and nobody ever
[31:55.040 --> 31:59.280]  really stops to think like, hey, this is a smash hit product. I see Apple Watches everywhere and
[31:59.280 --> 32:06.000]  they're making bongo revenue selling them. TV Plus maybe isn't going to be that big a deal
[32:06.000 --> 32:12.720]  financially, but they're very, very serious about it. And I feel like everybody's, instead of the
[32:12.720 --> 32:17.520]  way that the Apple Watch looked like it wasn't a big hit compared to, let's just even leave the
[32:17.520 --> 32:24.640]  iPhone out of it, but let's just say the iPad, which had these crazy go-go years in 2010,
[32:24.640 --> 32:33.040]  2011, 2012, because they were filling this completely unsaturated market of demand for
[32:33.040 --> 32:40.400]  tablet-sized computers. It was just a massive, massive hit and then had these weird years where
[32:40.400 --> 32:44.800]  they went from selling like 20 million a quarter to 10 million a quarter. And everybody was like,
[32:44.800 --> 32:48.000]  what's wrong? What's wrong? And I think in hindsight, it was just, well, people are still
[32:48.000 --> 32:54.160]  using their old iPads, right? The early years were inflated. Apple Watch didn't take off in a
[32:54.160 --> 32:59.520]  huge way like that. It's been just like a slow, steady, look, every year it gets better. Every
[32:59.520 --> 33:05.200]  year they add features. Every year they clarify their focus on what Apple Watch is actually good
[33:05.200 --> 33:12.080]  for, notifications and fitness. And more and more people start buying their first Apple Watch and
[33:12.080 --> 33:17.760]  it becomes a hit. The problem for TV Plus is that everybody's comparing it against companies like
[33:17.760 --> 33:23.920]  Netflix and Disney Plus, Hulu, anybody like that. And you can say, well, the numbers are smaller
[33:23.920 --> 33:29.760]  for TV Plus subscription than, everybody's smaller than Netflix, but it's not as big as Disney Plus,
[33:29.760 --> 33:36.640]  not as big as HBO Max. But for those companies that's existential, there is no business for
[33:36.640 --> 33:42.320]  Netflix other than selling Netflix subscriptions. And Disney, of course, has a much wider
[33:44.000 --> 33:52.160]  corporate domain, theme parks and cruise ships and ESPN and all sorts of other,
[33:52.160 --> 34:01.200]  you know, big, big conglomerate. But their bread and butter is entertaining families with classic
[34:01.200 --> 34:07.040]  characters. And that's what Disney Plus is chock full of Marvel and Star Wars and all the, you
[34:07.040 --> 34:14.560]  know, Mickey and Friends type stuff. It is a side hustle for Apple, but that's therefore they're
[34:14.560 --> 34:18.240]  approaching it that way, right? Like they're, you know, and that's the big knock is, well,
[34:18.240 --> 34:21.440]  why would I say if I'm only going to sign up for one, why would I sign up for TV Plus,
[34:21.440 --> 34:26.800]  but they don't even have a big library of stuff? Like I could sign up for Netflix and I can watch
[34:26.800 --> 34:35.360]  it 24 hours a day and I've fallen behind, right? Like you go watch Netflix for 24 hours and they
[34:35.360 --> 34:39.440]  can release so much new stuff that you've actually fallen behind on how much stuff is in their
[34:39.440 --> 34:45.120]  library. That's, they don't need to do that, right? And it's never been the goal. They're
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.720]  much more focused like the HBO of old where it's like, look, you could pay a premium and you can
[34:50.720 --> 34:59.600]  get these, a shorter list of high quality shows. I thought the fall lineup looked pretty good. I
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.400]  thought that Finch show with Tom Hanks, I didn't even hear about that one. That looked amazing.
[35:04.400 --> 35:05.200]  The robot?
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.520]  Yeah, I think it goes back to something you've mentioned several times before. And that is like,
[35:09.520 --> 35:13.920]  people have a hard time taking Apple executives at their word, even though they're amongst the
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.480]  most plainspoken executives I've ever encountered at any company ever, they really often do just
[35:18.480 --> 35:23.840]  tell you what's on their mind. And I think when you look at Apple, at TV plus through that lens,
[35:23.840 --> 35:28.560]  Apple, they want to have content, obviously they want to offer services on top of the iPhone as a
[35:28.560 --> 35:33.120]  platform. They want to make the value of their ecosystem greater so that people, you know,
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.560]  cynically they extract more value per customer that way, but they also provide more value for
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.800]  per customer. And that's increasingly important as iPhones become more, I don't want to say
[35:42.800 --> 35:48.880]  commodity items, but reach saturation and become more like tools. But also they have money and they
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.520]  want to tell great stories that they think aren't being told. And so they're willing to put some of
[35:53.520 --> 35:59.600]  that money behind those stories. And I think you can see that in where like Disney plus has Marvel
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.440]  and star Wars and the magic kingdom and all these brands. But if you like star Trek or DC comics,
[36:05.440 --> 36:10.400]  they have nothing for you. And the opposite is true of Warner brothers and Netflix has, you know,
[36:10.400 --> 36:16.000]  a bunch of variety stuff, but it's not sort of HBO level variety stuff. And I think Apple's got
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.280]  the, not just the desire, but the money to put new original programming on, which is interesting to
[36:21.280 --> 36:26.800]  people like us, who've been missing that as HBO has gotten more and more Warnerized. And I think
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.120]  Apple is super happy to do it. It just increases value for them and for us. And I think it's really
[36:31.120 --> 36:36.320]  no more complicated than that. Yeah. And you know, and they're really, you know, they're getting
[36:36.320 --> 36:41.200]  there, right. And it's, we're not, they're not going to debut by focusing on original content
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.280]  and not buying libraries of existing content to fill it up. It has to be a slow, you can't just
[36:47.280 --> 36:55.680]  debut with 50 shows, you know but they're starting to pick up the other categories of shows that they
[36:55.680 --> 37:02.240]  haven't had. Jon Stewart is a huge get right. Cause HBO has John Oliver and Bill Maher who do
[37:02.240 --> 37:10.160]  the sort of political comedy type thing. Netflix famously has sort of taken over the market for
[37:10.160 --> 37:14.480]  comedy specials. They don't really have shows like the John Oliver type thing.
[37:14.480 --> 37:17.440]  Chelsea Handler for a while, but they don't seem to have invested much in it.
[37:17.440 --> 37:22.640]  Yeah. And it didn't really stick. It was, and it was, I think she was doing, it was like,
[37:22.640 --> 37:28.400]  they weren't quite sure how to do it on, in a streaming format. Like what's worked for
[37:28.400 --> 37:33.680]  John Oliver and Bill Maher is a once a week format. Whereas Chelsea Handler was more of
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.720]  a nightly format, like a traditional talk show. But you know, it's, you try stuff, you know,
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.240]  who knows, maybe the new Jon Stewart show won't be any good. I don't, I mean, I'm looking forward
[37:42.240 --> 37:46.880]  to it, but I trust the guy, but you never know. It certainly is the type of show that Apple TV
[37:46.880 --> 37:52.320]  Plus hasn't had before. But the same with foundation, like the big sweeping space opera
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.760]  coming out too. They're, they're sort of filling the different genres as they go.
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.960]  Right. Classic material, a true, I haven't read it since I was a teenager,
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.160]  but I remember loving it. Yeah. But with, you know, a top level cast, super high level
[38:06.160 --> 38:12.640]  production values. So, I mean, I guess for all mankind, sort of, was that already? Which is one
[38:12.640 --> 38:15.360]  of my favorite things. Yeah, I could have put that in alternate history genre, but this is sort of
[38:15.360 --> 38:21.760]  like, like Battlestar or Star Wars or Dune or. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Let's say with spaceships
[38:21.760 --> 38:27.040]  that bear no bearing to reality. Interstellar space.
[38:29.280 --> 38:34.240]  But, and then compare and contrast with Fitness Plus, which I think is in, you know,
[38:34.240 --> 38:38.720]  those are the two services that Apple gave time to yesterday. And of course it makes sense to
[38:38.720 --> 38:44.480]  do Fitness Plus because they've, you know, it squeezed into the watch overall segment.
[38:44.480 --> 38:50.320]  It's a watch service. Right. It literally is a fitness service that presumes, the one thing that
[38:50.320 --> 38:56.480]  that service presumes is that everybody has an Apple watch who's using it. But it is interesting
[38:56.480 --> 39:03.040]  to me. It must be, and I know they, you know, they must have 30 or 40 trainers now and, you know,
[39:03.040 --> 39:10.800]  Peloton is obviously the market leader in that category where it's, it is sort of personality
[39:10.800 --> 39:15.680]  driven, you know, it's, it is, it's like podcasts sort of, it's like, but instead of listening to
[39:15.680 --> 39:22.480]  two lazy guys like me and you talk about technology and whatever else, it's people who
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.240]  are actually helping you break a sweat and, and do things. But people get into, it's not just like,
[39:28.240 --> 39:35.280]  show me anything that is spin. They, they have favorite trainers and they enjoy the music that
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.280]  they have. They enjoy their personalities and that, on the flip side, there's others who they
[39:39.280 --> 39:43.120]  don't like. And it's very personal. It's almost like the eighties with like Richard Simmons and
[39:43.120 --> 39:49.840]  Jane Fonda. Those fitness shows. Yeah. Right. But it is effectively though, it is shows,
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.560]  right? And it, you know, it makes sense that it's a standalone separate service from TV Plus,
[39:54.560 --> 40:03.600]  but effectively it's, it's video shows. But it must be so much, however good these trainers are
[40:03.600 --> 40:10.240]  and however many of them are, it must be so much cheaper to produce than all of the big budget TV
[40:10.240 --> 40:16.560]  Plus stuff, you know, like Foundation and paying Jennifer Aniston for the morning show and...
[40:18.400 --> 40:25.840]  See. Right. And even if you just look at Ted Lasso, which, you know, isn't like sci-fi level
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.120]  of special effects, there's a lot of special effects, like to make stadiums look full and
[40:31.120 --> 40:36.720]  stuff like that. You know, make it look like an actual soccer match took place at Wembley Stadium.
[40:36.720 --> 40:41.200]  You know, that's expensive and just, you know, we've, they've already built the studio and they
[40:41.200 --> 40:45.440]  can just, you know, show it in the studio. It's so much cheaper to produce, but it costs more.
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.240]  It's 10 bucks a month instead of five bucks a month. Yeah. I think because fitness is one
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.040]  of those niches where there's certain categories like finance, adult entertainment, fitness,
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.680]  where people are willing to just pay more for content than they are in, you know, for news or
[40:59.680 --> 41:03.840]  for other sorts of entertainment. Right. It's like, you're not, it's a lot, a lot of entertainment
[41:03.840 --> 41:11.920]  works that way. Right. Like when you go to see the new Avengers movie that had a $300 million budget,
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.960]  the box office ticket price is exactly the same as when you go to see the art house movie
[41:16.960 --> 41:22.960]  that was shot for $50,000. You know, it's still... Even like, not to derail us completely,
[41:22.960 --> 41:27.200]  but when you see what some influencers who quickly migrated to OnlyFans, making millions
[41:27.200 --> 41:32.080]  of dollars a month for essentially three or four snapshots and just realize your definition of
[41:32.080 --> 41:36.800]  how, of what it costs to make content and what you can earn from content. And what people are
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.040]  willing to pay for it. Right. Exactly. Yes. The other, and I know that TV Plus is not a new
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.240]  initiative and Fitness Plus, yes, it's only nine months old, but I think it's something that
[41:48.240 --> 41:54.720]  they'd been planning for years. And it was a natural parlay from the fitness and health
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.880]  credentials and enthusiasm they've built up among Apple Watch users. And it fits in with
[42:00.880 --> 42:09.280]  the overall push towards our big area of growth for the company is services. But so I'm not
[42:09.280 --> 42:17.120]  saying it's... Putting them in the event yesterday had anything to do with the legal and regulatory
[42:17.120 --> 42:25.040]  and just generally bad PR surrounding the App Store and Apple's services revenues garnered
[42:25.040 --> 42:32.480]  through the 30 to 15% cut they take through the App Store. I think that even if somehow
[42:32.480 --> 42:39.360]  in late 2021, those weren't hot button issues worldwide, they still would have been talking
[42:39.360 --> 42:42.880]  about TV Plus and Fitness Plus, but what stuck out to me, so I'm not saying that's why they were
[42:42.880 --> 42:50.240]  emphasizing this show, but it stuck out to me in that context, that those are much better services
[42:50.240 --> 42:56.480]  for Apple to be making money for. Not me as a financial advisor or investment advisor, but as
[42:56.480 --> 43:04.320]  a critic and observer of the company, because it's their own services, right? They're not seeking
[43:04.320 --> 43:12.960]  rent on Peloton to get 30% of signups from Peloton, and they're not seeking rent by taking 30% of in
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.840]  app purchases from Disney Plus. They're making their own thing, and they're getting all the
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.880]  revenue, and that, to me, is much healthier for the company's culture.
[43:23.520 --> 43:26.640]  Yeah, no, I think that's true. I'm going to push back on the term rent. I think the term
[43:26.640 --> 43:31.760]  rent-like tax is a huge underservice to the value of infrastructure, which is something that a lot
[43:31.760 --> 43:35.440]  of people pay routinely for, including the companies that call it rent-seeking or taxing
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.200]  when it happens to be Apple doing it. But I think Apple had... I don't want to say a problem,
[43:39.200 --> 43:43.520]  but they had a concern because they'd famously promised investors to double services revenue by,
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.640]  I think it was 2020, and a large portion of their services revenue is in-app payments from games on
[43:48.640 --> 43:52.880]  the App Store. And so it was very difficult to see them doing anything that would derail that
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.280]  promise, because that would be a massive hit for them on Wall Street. But I think it's also telling
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.360]  they didn't renew that promise after they hit it. They didn't say, we're going to do it again.
[44:01.360 --> 44:06.800]  And I think that is giving them the breathing room to realign how they earn services income,
[44:06.800 --> 44:11.280]  because hardware margins... Apple had really good margins this year, this last quarter,
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.200]  last quarter, but their hardware margins, because they're using more expensive components,
[44:15.200 --> 44:20.080]  haven't been the same as they were in previous years. And services margins are enormous,
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.920]  software margins are enormous. And I think building this out lets them take a lot of
[44:23.920 --> 44:28.880]  the pressure off relying on App Store in-app purchase, especially game in-app purchase revenue.
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.680]  Yeah, and I didn't mean anything negative by rent. I rented most of my adult life,
[44:33.680 --> 44:42.240]  and I got a good deal. I paid a landlord what we agreed upon, and I got a house to live in.
[44:42.240 --> 44:45.440]  That's true. I think some people use it disparagingly as a way of saying that
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.680]  Apple is trying to steal something in a way that they haven't earned.
[44:49.680 --> 44:59.760]  I get it. And I think that they have earned it. I'm not an absolutist. I'm not as anti-Apple's
[44:59.760 --> 45:08.640]  App Store revenue as a lot of people on our, in your and my sphere are. But I just don't think,
[45:08.640 --> 45:13.040]  and it's not like I think it's illegal. It's not that I think it's even immoral. I just think that
[45:13.040 --> 45:19.600]  it is sort of like financial junk food. And it's like resting, you know, you've already built this
[45:19.600 --> 45:24.800]  thing, which is great. And it is, you know, well, I'm not gonna... Apple calls it a financial
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.160]  miracle. I don't know if it's a miracle, but it is certainly a financial...
[45:28.160 --> 45:29.440]  There's no divinity involved.
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.680]  It's certainly a financial success story. And they deserve to earn some money from it.
[45:36.800 --> 45:40.800]  But I just don't think it's healthy for the company to be looking for ways. And there were
[45:40.800 --> 45:49.200]  signs last year or over the last year and a half of App Store reviewers seemingly looking for
[45:49.840 --> 45:57.920]  companies that were doing, you know, getting signups on the web and being told you need,
[45:57.920 --> 46:01.440]  you can keep doing that, but you need to add in app purchase for this too.
[46:02.240 --> 46:02.480]  And...
[46:02.480 --> 46:05.760]  Yeah, it was trying to meet those, that app, that services revenue doubling goal,
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.480]  which I think was unhealthy for them. But also to your point, it all, to me, it's like,
[46:10.480 --> 46:13.760]  yes, they built all this. They deserve something. The judge said they deserve something,
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.400]  but it just feels like the way they're going about it is so outdated. It's so 2009, 2010.
[46:18.960 --> 46:24.080]  It's just so much better for them to be growing the services revenue based on their own services.
[46:24.080 --> 46:31.520]  And it's just, it's a better outlook. And it's, to me, even if it's less profitable, I mean,
[46:31.520 --> 46:35.680]  and that there may be like with TV Plus, and I don't even know how they break it apart, you know,
[46:35.680 --> 46:40.480]  because presumably what they would like most people to do is sign up for Apple One,
[46:41.280 --> 46:49.600]  where it's a lot harder to say how much of Apple One is Apple TV Plus and how much of it is iCloud
[46:49.600 --> 46:56.640]  storage and how much of it is the other stuff that you can get. It's just good, right? And Amazon
[46:56.640 --> 47:01.760]  has sort of led the way on that, where it's like, look, just sign up for Amazon Prime and we'll
[47:01.760 --> 47:06.080]  give you all sorts of good stuff. We'll give you expedited shipping and we'll give you discounts.
[47:06.080 --> 47:11.520]  And here, you could just have all these TV shows here. We'll just share it here. Here you go.
[47:11.520 --> 47:18.080]  Here's movies and TV shows. And just sign up, just sign up, be loyal, keep signing up. I think
[47:18.080 --> 47:24.240]  Apple wants that. I think having your own original content that you own and control is good for them.
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.480]  I don't know. I just thought that that was, it just stuck out to me in a way that it might not
[47:30.480 --> 47:35.840]  have a year ago. Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. All right, let's take another break here and

[49:15.920 --> 49:20.960]  with pre-portioned ingredients that ensure you won't spend money on excess food that winds up
[49:20.960 --> 49:24.640]  going in the trash. If you just need a little bit of sour cream for the recipe, they give you
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.880]  a little bit of sour cream. You don't end up with a 16-ounce container of sour cream that you're
[49:28.880 --> 49:34.880]  going to spoon out a little bit for. It's really, really convenient. And it's also got a lot of
[49:34.880 --> 49:40.080]  flexibility. Food preferences, plan size, like how many members are in your household, that sort of
[49:40.080 --> 49:44.160]  thing, or skip a week whenever you need to. Like if you're going away or just have other plans,

[50:37.680 --> 50:42.880]  way. The funny thing about going the other way was, did you notice this? That with the iPad mini,
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.560]  they didn't talk about the chip. Yeah. Yeah. And they didn't talk about the chip for the watch
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.200]  either. So I wasn't sure what reason we're talking about the various chips that's for.
[50:53.200 --> 50:56.800]  So maybe we should go in the order. They went actually, let's take it back. Let's go. Let's
[50:56.800 --> 51:02.560]  do it in their order. They didn't talk about the iPad mini chip because it was the A15 and they
[51:02.560 --> 51:09.280]  wanted to save the let's tell you all about the A15 for the iPhone 13 segment. It's kind of
[51:09.280 --> 51:19.360]  interesting because the iPad mini actually has the five core GPU variant that on the iPhones 13
[51:19.360 --> 51:24.560]  is only in the pro models. The regular 13 and 13 mini have four core GPUs.
[51:25.360 --> 51:30.640]  It's a really nice device, the iPad mini. Yeah. And that's an interesting choice because it's
[51:30.640 --> 51:36.640]  easy to see that Apple needs a little bit more power in the iPhone pros because of
[51:36.640 --> 51:41.600]  pro res and cinematic video and some of the other stuff we're going to be talking about promotion.
[51:41.600 --> 51:46.240]  But the, the iPad mini, the iPad air, which is basically what the iPad mini is a shrunken down
[51:46.240 --> 51:51.360]  version of just, it hasn't the A14, which was essentially the exact same chip four core,
[51:51.360 --> 51:55.040]  four GPU core version of this chip. So obviously they're giving it a little bit more graphical
[51:56.560 --> 52:06.000]  and I'm not sure why yet. I don't know either. It might be maybe just because the iPad mini
[52:06.000 --> 52:12.400]  is sort of on a unique, seemingly its entire history from the beginning until now on a unique
[52:12.400 --> 52:18.720]  schedule where it, it's always been in the lineup. There's a certain contingent of people in use
[52:18.720 --> 52:24.640]  cases who want that small size. Maybe it's kids playing games. Apple mentioned doctors who have
[52:24.640 --> 52:30.640]  lab coat pockets that are sized for the iPad mini and a bigger iPad would just be just heavy in a
[52:30.640 --> 52:37.600]  lab coat pocket pilots and, and particularly pilots and smaller airplane cockpits where
[52:37.600 --> 52:44.720]  every single space saving decision is that can be made is made. But it doesn't get up, it doesn't
[52:44.720 --> 52:49.760]  get updated every year and never has gotten updated every year, but when it does get refreshed
[52:49.760 --> 52:57.200]  tends to be refreshed to about as high spec as you could reasonably expect for a $500 iPad.
[52:57.200 --> 53:00.880]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yes. And I guess because of that they,
[53:00.880 --> 53:04.160]  they want to give it the latest silicon so that it'll stay useful. We'll get updates for as long
[53:04.160 --> 53:07.760]  as possible when you do buy it. Right. I don't know when they're going to update the iPad Air,
[53:07.760 --> 53:13.440]  but I would wager fairly heavily that they'll update the iPad Air before they update the iPad
[53:13.440 --> 53:19.920]  mini again. I think the last iPad mini, the one that just got obviated by the one released
[53:19.920 --> 53:26.000]  yesterday or announced yesterday had the A12. So it's sort of look, you know, if we, I don't know,
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.720]  it doesn't really matter going back historically past that, but you know, it's like in every three
[53:30.720 --> 53:35.760]  year up upgrade update, they were announced together like the iPad mini and the iPad Air
[53:35.760 --> 53:39.920]  had that new design and then they were updating it without almost barely not mentioning the iPad
[53:39.920 --> 53:44.880]  mini after a while. And then when the AirPods 2 came out right before Apple did the very first
[53:44.880 --> 53:49.040]  services event where they announced TV plus, they put a bunch of products out and press releases.
[53:49.040 --> 53:53.600]  And one was the new iPad Air and the new iPad mini. But then last year they only updated the
[53:53.600 --> 53:56.960]  Air and then now this year they're doing the mini. So there seems like they're out of sync
[53:56.960 --> 54:01.920]  for the first time. Yeah. The other thing that stuck out to me was that the volume buttons are
[54:01.920 --> 54:06.720]  on the top, which I'm not even sure if we should call it the top, you know, is it the top or is it
[54:06.720 --> 54:12.720]  the left-hand side if you hold it sideways? Opposite the port. Right. Opposite the port.
[54:12.720 --> 54:16.720]  Yeah. I guess, I guess that's what you, what you could call it. It's funny because like people
[54:16.720 --> 54:21.200]  were wondering, well, Apple make a smaller pencil and they didn't, they just moved the buttons.
[54:21.200 --> 54:27.680]  Yeah. Well, there are no buttons though on the, I have, well, I guess there are actually,
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.560]  yeah, that is where the volume buttons are. Huh? They're on the right. Hmm. I guess that might be
[54:32.560 --> 54:36.880]  why they did it. Because their smart keyboard would block them on the other side, but there's
[54:36.880 --> 54:40.960]  no smart keyboard or smart connector on the iPad mini. I guess Apple didn't want to make a teeny
[54:40.960 --> 54:49.200]  tiny magic keyboard. There is, it's little funny things like this that you and I noticed, but it's
[54:49.200 --> 54:58.960]  like, even after all these years of being, having the job of obsessively devoting time to whichever
[54:58.960 --> 55:04.160]  minute details of design that we see fit, I still think of things, you know, like it's always been
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.000]  a little weird. I still think it's a little weird that the iPhone is one of the only phones on the
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  market with a mute toggle. I love it. And I don't know though, if that's just because I've been
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.800]  using an iPhone for 14 years and so I don't know what I would do without it. I do not want to turn
[55:20.800 --> 55:28.000]  the screen on and fish around in control center to mute it. I still wish that the iPad had it.
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.080]  Remember the iPad had the mute switch and then they made a system setting that you could change
[55:34.080 --> 55:41.440]  the mute switch to be a rotation lock. And I remember thinking, I kind of, I get why they
[55:41.440 --> 55:46.720]  don't add two toggles, but I kind of wish I had both. I like muting it with the switch, but I also
[55:46.720 --> 55:53.040]  like the rotation lock for reading in bed and not having the screen rotate. And then they just got
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.560]  rid of the switch entirely and you have to do it all through control center. And it's, you know,
[55:56.560 --> 56:02.080]  it's not the biggest pain in the butt, but like when my iPad is on my bedside and it's ping,
[56:02.080 --> 56:09.920]  ping, ping, and it's like, ah, I can't just like clumsily find a switch and flick it. I have to
[56:09.920 --> 56:14.880]  like pick it up, have to look at control center, have to remember exactly. Well, you can hold down
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.800]  volume down and if you hold down long enough, it'll mute. But by that time you'd probably hit
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.720]  mute anyway by the time you've realized that it's muted. So it's one of those counterintuitive
[56:22.720 --> 56:26.480]  things. Can you do it when it's locked? I don't know that you can't. I'm trying it right now.
[56:26.480 --> 56:30.640]  I have an iPad in my hand. Oh, maybe not when it's locked. Yeah. Maybe only when you're using it.
[56:30.640 --> 56:35.040]  Yeah. I think you have to, I don't know if it's no, but you can just wake the screen and it'll
[56:35.040 --> 56:40.080]  do it. Oh, that's it. That's a good tip. Yeah, that's a good, I learned some, although it did,
[56:40.080 --> 56:47.600]  nope, it unlocked. It's cry curse you face ID. I don't know if you might be able to, but it still
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.200]  is interesting to me. But the other thing that's interesting to me is that the phone has always had
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.080]  the volume buttons. When you're holding the phone with the camera at the top and the port at the
[56:56.080 --> 57:03.120]  bottom, the volume buttons are on the left and on the iPad, they're on the right. But I guess it
[57:03.120 --> 57:09.760]  has my thinking is it has something to do with the way Apple presumes you would put the laptop
[57:09.760 --> 57:16.000]  in horizontal mode while in a keyboard. Yeah. Right. And in fact, with the modern ones that have
[57:16.880 --> 57:21.040]  the smart connector, you know, you kind of have to do it that way because the camera
[57:21.040 --> 57:27.680]  would, therefore the camera would still be at the top. And if you put the volume buttons on
[57:27.680 --> 57:31.520]  the other side, you wouldn't be able to access the volume buttons while it was mounted in the
[57:31.520 --> 57:38.480]  keyboard. But then they didn't have space for it if they were going to have the pencil be on
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.560]  that side where it kind of has to be, because even though they don't have a smart keyboard for the
[57:42.560 --> 57:49.600]  iPad mini, you can buy keyboard, little tiny, tiny finger keyboards for it. And you'd want the pencil
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.960]  to still be on top. And that takes up space from the camera being in landscape mode, which a lot
[57:54.960 --> 58:00.480]  of us want as well. Right. So much room in there. Right. Right. So therefore the buttons had to move
[58:00.480 --> 58:05.040]  and there they are. And Apple doesn't like to explain decisions like that, but I think we
[58:05.040 --> 58:13.280]  just backwards engineered it. I don't have much more to say about it. The new iPad also, I mean,
[58:13.280 --> 58:16.800]  you know, what are you going to say? You know, it's the low end. The one thing that struck me
[58:16.800 --> 58:21.680]  was that they emphasized repeatedly that it's their best selling, most popular iPad. And maybe
[58:21.680 --> 58:29.600]  they do that every time they update it. But it's sort of a weird flex because it, it's so clearly
[58:29.600 --> 58:35.920]  is the most popular only because of its low price. Yeah. I mean, a weird flex for Apple, like who's
[58:35.920 --> 58:43.840]  not really known for flexing about affordable prices. I mean, the MacBook Air, they talk about
[58:43.840 --> 58:47.840]  it that way, but you never hear them talk about like the iPhone SE is their most popular phone.
[58:47.840 --> 58:53.280]  I don't think it is the third most popular, but it'd be a weird flex anyway. It does speak though
[58:53.280 --> 58:57.120]  to the difference. And I know that at the high end, you know, you can configure MacBook Pros
[58:57.120 --> 59:02.240]  that cost $5,000. And so there's, you know, there's clearly a high end for MacBook Pros,
[59:02.240 --> 59:11.040]  that's far beyond even the biggest, most expensive iPad Pro, but at the levels that people typically
[59:11.040 --> 59:20.240]  spend for MacBooks or iPad Pros, the prices are fairly similar, especially when you, if you bake
[59:20.240 --> 59:25.520]  in the cost of a magic keyboard, right. And if anything, maybe the iPad Pros are more expensive.
[59:25.520 --> 59:34.000]  Whereas the MacBook Air has that magic $999 price point and really good configurations for very
[59:34.000 --> 59:42.000]  typical people at around $1,200. And that's just way more expensive than a pretty good iPad for
[59:42.000 --> 59:49.040]  most people that starts at like $329. Yeah, no, absolutely. And it really is that like,
[59:49.040 --> 59:52.320]  I've called it the most, like the best deal in tech for a long time. But if you're looking just
[59:52.320 --> 59:56.560]  to get into an iPad, getting one for $329, especially one that has the, like, it doesn't
[59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.800]  have high end specs. And they're very clever about what they compromise on like the camera quality.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.960]  And there's no laminated display. And it's things that would drive me personally up the wall. But
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.960]  it's things that a lot of people just do not care about. Right. Try explaining to a lot of
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.280]  those people what promotion does. Yes, try taking it away from my teenage son. And, you know,
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:21.280]  he's very excited about promotion on the iPhones 13. Awesome. Well, he notices though, he's got
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:26.400]  young healthy eyes and an eye for graphics. And he notices that, you know, and is actually
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.440]  frustrated that like his Macbook doesn't have it, you know, that the only device that has it is
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.160]  an iPad Pro. But I don't have much more to say about it. I guess I'm not surprised. I guess you
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:44.080]  and I talk about this every time. But the mini got USB-C, the regular iPad did not. Spoiler looking
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.960]  ahead a segment or two on this show, the iPhones 13, including the Pros do not have USB-C. People
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:59.280]  don't get it. But it's, you know, it seems pretty clear that the iPhone 10 marked the effectively
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:06.400]  2.0 era of the basic concept face ID instead of touch ID round corners, no home button on the
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:13.440]  front instead of flick, flick up from the top or from the bottom gesture system. And the iPads have
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.000]  had a similar re reckoning to remove the home button from the front face go to the all screen
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.960]  display as Apple likes to call it. And with those iPads, they go to USB-C when they make that
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:33.760]  transition, because they're being positioned as somewhat more like computers, right? I mean,
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.520]  and it's like people will never let Apple forget that commercial they made, where it was like,
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.000]  what's a what's a computer? And it's like, it's a commercial. It wasn't meant as like a
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.080]  scientific argument. Yeah, it was meant to be thought provoking, and it certainly succeeded.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.560]  Right. It's like with did you see the thing where AOC went to the Met Gala and she was
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.400]  addressed that said tax the rich. And people were like, does she not know that rich people do pay
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.640]  taxes? And it's like, are you serious? I mean, like, whatever you say, not know that rich people
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:09.120]  are at the Met Gala. Right. And it's like, yeah, she knows. She knows. Tax the rich doesn't mean
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.000]  that she thinks that the rich people aren't charged any taxes. It's come on. Nobody was trying
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.880]  to argue that the iPad Pro is not a computer. Luckily, Nicki Minaj took all the heat off of
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:30.560]  AOC. Yeah, yeah. I don't even want to go there. Either. But that was bizarre. Yes, I thought it
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:36.480]  was a joke that they said Tucker Carlson on Fox News went deep on the Nicki Minaj's cousins,
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:43.040]  friends testicles swelling from the COVID vaccine story. I thought that I thought that was a joke.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.480]  And it turns out no, that was actually that was actually what his show was about.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:50.080]  We don't have Fox News here. So I only know him from CNN. So I'm really out of touch those
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.920]  those damn cousins, cousins, friends. You really couldn't make it up. My cousins, friends, doctor
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:03.360]  says this. Anything else on the on the iPads? I don't really have much. No, I just think a lot
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.680]  of people or some people at least were confused why the iPad mini had better specs than the the
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.640]  iPad, even though the iPad is bigger or why the iPad mini. But I think Apple clearly positions it
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.400]  as a not like the top tier device, but as a good midpoint device. And they don't see small as being
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.840]  cheap. They see they see small as being a feature. So they charge for it accordingly. Yeah, it's
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:31.280]  and you know, the iPhone 13 and 12 mini sort of throw that off because they are $100 cheaper than
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:37.920]  the non mini corresponding versions. And there, there is an argument to be had that well, a bigger
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:43.520]  screen is a more expensive component, blah, blah, blah, but the mini has always been a sort of
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.720]  not premium product like iPad pros, but
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.920]  like mid tier, it's yeah, it's a mini iPad Air, not the mini iPad, nothing.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.840]  Yeah. And in some ways you do, you know, you can be expected to pay a premium for miniaturization.
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.960]  I thought it was pretty cool that like, holster type thing that the pilot had the mini strapped
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:08.320]  to his legs that they show. It's like people will pay a premium for that to have, you know,
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:09.600]  they're, you know,
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:14.560]  I think the iPad nothing is like the iPhone se and the the iPad mini is like the iPhone mini and
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.160]  the iPad Air is like the iPhone, the iPhone 13 should be the iPhone 13 Air and then it would
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:18.720]  all make sense.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.480]  Yes, I agree. At least that's the way you should think about them in your head as being
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:32.480]  the equivalent of each other. Apple watch series seven. Boy, I filed some claim chowder on this one.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.320]  You didn't get the new flat design.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.600]  What a weird, can you think of an example where more, so there's Gurman, Ming-Chi Kuo,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:52.720]  and then YouTube sensation and teen heartthrob, John Prosser all had this seemingly independently,
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  not based on each other's reporting, but all had it as a flat side design that basically like the
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:05.760]  way that the iPhone 11 was rounded and sort of pill shaped on the sides and then the iPhone 12
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.800]  and now 13 have flat sides like the iPad pros that the watch would be making a similar move
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:21.360]  in form factor to flat sides this year. Prosser had it back in May. Gurman reiterated it last
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.960]  month. And then Ming-Chi Kuo reiterated it on Friday, just like three days, three or
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.320]  four days before the event. It's a very strange thing to get wrong.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.360]  And the only possible explanation I've seen is that, you know, sometimes Apple has more
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.960]  audacious and more conservative prototypes. And if something goes wrong with the more
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.880]  audacious one, they switch to the more conservative one. And when you heard rumblings
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.200]  about the Apple Watch having complications in manufacturing, they pulled that they pulled
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.880]  that lever. But that was certainly have happened way before. Right. It didn't happen when the
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:06:01.200]  when the rumors of the the production problems in August hit that that decision was made a while
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:08.000]  ago. Now, at what point might such a design have been in the running on the whiteboard?
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.360]  Or I guess at the time on the zoom call for the 2021 watch? I don't know. But it would have been
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:19.440]  like a year ago. I think I have heard from somebody who heard from somebody that the
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:26.480]  design is legit. But whether it was ever intended, whether it ever will ship, don't know. But it was
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:35.360]  definitely never intended for 2021. It was a 2022 thing. Which is interesting. And I think it speaks
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:41.920]  to the sort of sources who leak these sort of things like the people in Cupertino who work in
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.120]  Apple Watch product marketing, and engineering, who know exactly all of the technical details
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:56.560]  of the this year's Apple Watch Series seven are not the type of people who leak these things.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.040]  And the people who do leak these things are people who like, well, I know I have these CAD files,
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:06.880]  and I have a code name, but I have no idea when or if you know what what level of prototype this is,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.400]  when or if Apple intends to ship it. But they have a CAD file they could leak and then someone
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.720]  like Prosser can commission renders based on the CAD files and you can see what they would look
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.400]  like. What else? The only thing that was interesting to me is like, you know, years and
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.200]  years ago, you and I and John Pachowski and even Gurman and Jim Dalrymple, we would have like
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:30.640]  conversation about this stuff with no animosity, no acrimony, none of that. But now, at least when
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.280]  I look at Twitter, all of the leaked people are just clawing at each other constantly. And it's
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.720]  kind of sad. Yeah, I keep score on the claim chatter, not to be a jerk about it, but I think
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:45.840]  it's worth remembering what people's track records are. And I think also, like one of the big issues
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.680]  this year is that Mark Gurman famously started a newsletter, and he tweets, and he's very careful
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.200]  what he puts in Bloomberg, like what he puts in Bloomberg, he calls it a report. And he lists out
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.640]  all this stuff. But what he puts in Twitter and his newsletter are sometimes completely
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:04.480]  framed as opinions or as guesses. And yet people reblog them or promote them or video them as if
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:10.480]  they're the same betting as his reports, which is proven not to be the case there. Like if you and
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:17.840]  I are spitballing, we have guesses or opinions. Right. And he will often, too, just sort of
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:23.280]  spitball ideas like we do. But like, you know, here's what three products I think would be
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:30.320]  announced together. I think, for example, I think he just spitballed that the September event would
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:39.440]  be iPhones and the watch and October would be iPads and Macs. And they did the iPads yesterday.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.640]  But when he spitballed that, he wasn't saying that's what I've heard. That's what sources say
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.240]  my plan is. He was just thinking it through and thought that would be a logical way to group the
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:56.400]  products together. Right. But you are right that people don't parse the inside baseball sort of
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:05.360]  what is what has a Bloomberg News byline. And, of course, Bloomberg's typical sourcing where every
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.680]  single paragraph includes according to the sources who declined to put their names on because they
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.840]  don't have permission to talk about them yet or whatever that, you know, boilerplate they put into
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.040]  every claim. But that's why they put those. We can say that it's sort of is a stilted way of
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:26.400]  reporting. But they're the reason they insist on it internally is to assert that this is why we're
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:33.280]  putting it in a report that sources who do know told us this was true. And then there's another
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.640]  assertion in the next paragraph. And we're going to say that it's from those people, same sources.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:46.480]  I thought that the watch to the flat side watch rumor it it never I mean, who knows because
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:55.120]  renders they could be totally legit cat files with with the dimensions exactly correct. And just the
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.600]  result of the leaker renders. They never it never looked right to me. It doesn't sit right with me.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.000]  There's something about it. That's like, Hmm, I don't know. It doesn't seem as physically
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:13.520]  appealing to me as the pill shaped classic Apple Watch. And like bad feng shui. Yeah, like but
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.560]  like but yeah, it's hard to even it's ineffable. It's hard to even quite say sometimes when you're
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.160]  looking at two fonts, it's it's sometimes you can't even say why you like one was more aerial
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.760]  than Yeah, no that but I thought I'd still think it's interesting. And it would be such a total
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:38.160]  180 is that the industrial design of series zero through series three. And then with series four,
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:44.880]  they redesigned that's when they resized them and instead of 36 and 40 went to 38 and 42
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:52.480]  millimeters is that how they went? I think so. Right. So yeah. But they got it got rounder,
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:11:00.080]  it got more organic, more round, less of a rectangle, like a round rect and more of a
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:07.520]  complicated 360 degrees all the way around elliptical shape, super lips or whatever.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.920]  Yeah, so it would be weird to me if they then went flat. But you know, like I said, I've heard
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.560]  that maybe that's a legit design. I don't know if it's credible or not, but didn't happen. What we
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:22.720]  did get is a bigger screen and faster battery charging 33% faster battery charging if you use
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:30.880]  a USB C to Apple Watch charger. Yes, not a big deal. Not a big upgrade. Not bad. Now.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.920]  It's a different market though. Like with the iPhone, it's such a saturated market. And the
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.480]  upgrade cycles are three, four or five years out now. But most people even most iPhone owners still
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.960]  don't have an Apple Watch and Apple's less concerned about Apple Watch upgrade. I mean,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.480]  they'll take your money regardless. But they're less concerned about Apple Watch upgrades than
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.800]  they are of just getting people into the Apple Watch to begin with. So I think they're just
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.680]  constantly chipping away at roadblocks and adding features that they think will appeal so that more
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:01.440]  and more people end up getting their first Apple Watch at this point. Yeah. And the other thing
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.720]  they didn't spend a lot of time talking about it, but they did talk about some durability
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.400]  improvements to the front facing crystal, which I believe only pertains to the aluminum models,
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.360]  the ones that use the ion glass or whatever they call it, not the sapphire that's on the
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.760]  steel and titanium ones. Yeah, the ion exchange glass. But that's the sort of thing that
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:31.840]  it shows that Apple sees these and they know people are using them for fitness. I have friends
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:37.520]  who are into rock climbing and are still really were looking for they want that rumor. Remember,
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:41.920]  Gurman had the rumor earlier this year of the Apple Watch. What did he call it? Expedition
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:51.360]  rugged? Yeah, the ruggedized version or Explorer. Explorer would be weird because that to me would
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:58.000]  be a code name, not a product name because Rolex famously has the Explorer and Explorer II. That
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.600]  was like the watch that was first taken to the top of Mount Everest. I can't see them using
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.960]  Explorer, but whatever. The idea would be like a G-Shock type Apple Watch. And I know there's
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.680]  demand for that. There's definitely demand for that because there's people who just it doesn't
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.600]  matter what you say about how rugged the glass is. It's still glass and rock climbing in particular.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.960]  Rocks are pretty hard. Or people still use garments because the garment is just they do have
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.360]  ruggedized versions and Apple doesn't. Right. I linked to it. I remember it was when I was a kid.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.480]  When Casio first came out with the G-Shock, the commercial, the iconic commercial was they
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:40.400]  strapped it to a hockey puck and had a hockey player slapshot it past the goalie and then show
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.640]  that the watch was unharmed. I wouldn't do that with an Apple Watch. I mean, it's just not that
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.960]  type. So there's a market for that. This isn't that. But it just shows though the idea that they
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:57.600]  would even re-engineer the way the crystal is made. It's thicker. And then there's some talk
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.680]  on the web pages about how it connects to the aluminum frame, that it's just more and more
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:10.800]  durable all across the board, like less likely to crack and less likely to like pop off. That just
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.280]  shows though that Apple knows people spending four or five hundred dollars on an Apple Watch.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.680]  It's still a four hundred dollar watch. That's way more than most people spend on a watch. And
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.720]  they expect it to last for years. Yeah. And that commercial when you feel the person falling off
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.760]  the bike and just slamming the watch into the ground. That was a wincing moment for me.
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.880]  The biggest disappointment to me watch-wise yesterday is that the entry model is still
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.960]  the Series 3. Yeah. Same. Because it's like, oh man, that thing is long in the tooth. And
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.280]  even just for sympathizing with my developer friends who look forward to the day of no longer
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:57.760]  supporting the old original sharp cornered display for two sizes of watch. Because the Series 3 is
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:05.200]  the one of the old original form factor with the old original purely rectangular screen. And Series
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:12.560]  4 is when they started with the round racks for the display. Significantly bigger display. And
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.760]  just nicer. It would be such a nicer baseline. I was thinking like, often it's based entirely on
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.760]  differentiation. And I was thinking when they and they wanted the Apple Watch Series 3 because it
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.640]  doesn't look like the more expensive Apple Watch. But now that the most expensive Apple Watch has
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.280]  a new design, I was hoping that they would push down the previous Apple Watch 4 design. You maybe
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:36.560]  move the SE to the low end, which is what the iPhone SE is. And then have maybe like a Series 4
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:43.520]  or Series 5 somewhere in the middle ground. Also because selfishly that's the cap point for
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.720]  updates. And if Apple's selling a brand new Apple Watch Series 3, that's going to keep watchOS bound
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.840]  to that device for at least a few years. And maybe that costs us a few things over time. Right.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:59.280]  No, it might. That's exactly the sort of thing I was thinking. But I get it. And I know that that's
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.160]  sort of how pricing works. And it's not dastardly, but you can say starting at $199 and then you go
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:12.320]  in the store and start looking at them. And when you're looking at them, it's true of any sort of
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:17.200]  watches, but it's absolutely the case with like mechanical watches too. You cannot judge by
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.480]  photos. You have to see it on your wrist. You have to look at it in real at the real size.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:28.400]  And, you know, you look at the Series 3 compared to even the Apple Watch SE and it's like, oh,
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.960]  I do see. Oh, that is nicer. Huh? Well, all right. I was already going to spend $200. Why
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.920]  don't I spend $300? It's that cheap microwave that you go to the store for and end up buying
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.680]  the nicer microwave. It doesn't look like a piece of crap. But I'm also sure they have data that
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.680]  shows that there is a segment of the customer base that is parents or children, the people who
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.600]  are doing family setups, that they just want the lowest viable product for an Apple Watch.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:59.440]  Yeah, no, no, I'm sure they do sell the Series 3 too. But it's the biggest disappointment to
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.560]  me just because not because I want to buy the cheapest Apple Watch, but I just like the idea
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:11.040]  of getting everybody at Series 4 or later. Yeah. Anything else on that watch or fitness?
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.600]  I guess overall, we're gonna have to wait and see because the watches aren't coming out. You know,
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.640]  famously last year, we got the watch before the iPhone, now we're getting the iPhone before the
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.160]  watch. So sort of like getting the shuttlecraft without the Starship. And I want it's one of
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.360]  those products where I really want to get it in my hands and try it out and see what palpable
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.400]  differences are really in it. Yeah, that is interesting. And later this fall, it leaves
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.600]  them an awful lot of leeway. Yeah, I guess with manufacturing problems and with the chip shortages
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.760]  and just the way COVID is still screwing up the whole world. They don't know. So why not leave it
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.240]  as vague as possible? I would guess, just based on previous years where items were late, that we're
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:58.880]  talking mid to late October. Maybe with like reviews going out in mid-October and pre-orders
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:04.240]  third week of October and shipping at the end of October-ish schedule, but I have no idea.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.440]  Because they're hot items for the holidays and they're going to want to make sure that
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.280]  they're available to order. Yeah, it's exactly like I said with the AirPods. You know it's a
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:19.520]  huge holiday item. And Jeff Williams's team is directly overseeing, let's get these out as soon
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:23.360]  as we can. They're not like, ah, la-di-da, later this fall, I've got all of them.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.920]  I'm going to take like, why aren't you on a plane? Yeah, exactly. There's probably quite a
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.360]  few people who got the, why aren't you on a plane already regarding this? Because the clock is
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:39.680]  ticking. We talk about it all every year. But a lot of people like to get their Christmas shopping
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:45.040]  out of the way or as early as possible. So it does make a difference. When the person
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:49.040]  who owns the product is also the COO, you have very little safety margin in there for your
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:55.600]  inactivity. Let me thank our third and final sponsor of the episode. Another product I truly
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.920]  love. I would tell people to buy this even if they weren't sponsoring the show, but they are
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:05.760]  sponsoring the show. And that's Away. Whether it's a trip to the corner store, a weekend away,
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:10.320]  or an extended stay with friends and family, we're all navigating the current reality of travel.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:16.480]  But no matter your destination or style, Away's suitcases, bags, and accessories all come in a
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:21.840]  variety of colors, sizes, and materials to suit your needs and inspire your future travels. All
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.880]  of Away's suitcases are designed to last a lifetime with durable exteriors that can withstand
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:32.160]  even the roughest of baggage handlers. Every suitcase comes with an interior organization
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:37.360]  system that includes a built-in compression pad to help you pack more. I love the compression pad.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.320]  You put your shirts behind it, cinch it up, and they stay wrinkle-free or about as wrinkle-free
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.680]  as you could ever expect a shirt to stay in a suitcase that you could possibly imagine.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.800]  They also have a hidden and removable laundry bag that separates your dirty clothes from your clean
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.560]  clothes as you're going about your vacation or your business trip or whatever the hell you're
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:03.520]  doing. They've got four 360-degree spinner wheels that guarantee the smoothest roll. They're great
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.080]  wheels. And their suitcases are available in different materials like polycarbonate,
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:14.400]  aluminum, and durable nylon in a variety of colors and sizes. Their products are designed
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:19.520]  to last a lifetime. If any part of your suitcase breaks, Away's standout customer service team
[01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:25.200]  will arrange to have it fixed or replaced. And this is how confident they are in it. 100-day

[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.800]  All right, iPhone 13. I guess no surprises. Any surprises?
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:32.160]  No, I don't think there were any big surprises. I mean, either because there were, not just because
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:37.040]  there were leaks, but also because Apple, we've now got, what is it, 12 previous,
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.960]  14 previous models to base Apple's release strategy or cadence at.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:50.000]  Right. I am happy that it turned out to be true. I believe the rumors were all over the place on
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.640]  this, though, too, whether the pro cameras would all would both be the same, both sizes. Last year
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:06.800]  was the first time since the Plus era, circa six, seven, eight, that the smaller pro tier phone had
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:14.320]  a lesser camera system than the big Pro Max, which was a heartbreaker for me. I actually wound up,
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.560]  I didn't even buy the 12 Pro. I bought the iPhone 12 with just two lenses. Turned out to be a pretty
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.640]  good bet because I bought it at a time when COVID was already not good. I knew that it was going to
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.800]  be bad all winter long. And I thought, so therefore I'll only really have the summer where I'll be
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.200]  going anywhere. Probably took less photos, fewer photos last year than any other year.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:44.080]  This year, though, 13 Pro, 13 Pro Max, exact same camera systems. And the 13 and 13 mini have the
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:50.080]  same cameras as each other. Yes. And they all have sensor shift on the wide angles now, not just the
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:56.960]  Max, which is really nice. Right, right. Everybody's got sensor shift on the wide angle, which is the
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:03.440]  it's still, it screws me up because it's the one X. And I think wide angle is the one that 0.5 X,
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:09.040]  but that's ultra wide. Like I kind of wish it was instead of calling it wide and ultra wide,
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:17.520]  they called the 0.5 wide called the one X normal or regular and called the telephoto, telephoto,
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:24.720]  but whatever. I tried to stick in it to the numeric X modifiers. They're just going by the
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:30.240]  effect of millimeter numbers, I guess. Right. There are, it is true though that it's not the,
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:38.880]  the, oh, and the telephoto now goes to 3.0 X. So that's pretty good. Like in, in terms of like,
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:44.800]  where is Apple making progress year over year and where are they clearly devoting
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.440]  their engineering resources? It's the camera, right? I mean, I don't even know what I'm going
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.120]  to do from, for a review this year, because my lead last year was, was entirely that they could
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.800]  just call it the Apple camera. It's way more of a camera than a phone. Screw pans. You know,
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:06.880]  you could just go to Disney, right? It's the camera, you know, and I don't, I didn't stop
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.800]  watch it, but if you combine both Kayan Drance's iPhone 13 introduction with JAWS' 13 Pro
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.840]  introduction, it clearly, most of the time was spent talking about camera stuff, both video and
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:25.200]  still, and with the new cinematic mode for video. So what do you think, just going back to the
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.640]  telephoto for a minute, they went previously, it was effective 52 millimeter for the iPhone Pro Max
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:37.040]  last year, they went up to 65. Now they've gone up to 77, like an effective 77 millimeters,
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.800]  but at the same time, they've gone from, I think it was 2.0 to 2.4 and now 2.8. So they're going
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.560]  longer, but they're not, but they're also going slower at the same time. Right. With the aperture.
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.880]  Yeah. And that's just sort of the nature of going to longer lenses. I mean, you know,
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.320]  this better than I do with your racket with YouTube, but well, but you go to longer fixed
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.040]  lenses and they get slower. The aperture numbers go up as the widest that they get.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.920]  I think there's a lot that goes into it, but clearly part of it is that the Pro
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.120]  models are the only ones with the LIDAR and that's used for night mode, portrait photography,
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:22.960]  and for faster autofocus in low light. So the things that would be worse because the maximum
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:29.040]  aperture is a larger number are being helped through the computational photography and with
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:34.720]  the help of the LIDAR and the sensor shift and also there's all sorts of other things they're
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:40.960]  doing to compensate. Putting all the numbers aside, it doesn't seem like it's getting worse
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:46.160]  to take low light pictures with the telephoto lens. In fact, it's probably getting better,
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.240]  even though the aperture is going up. Yeah, I think that's very true. I think they've
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.920]  always been making smart trade-offs and now they have a bit of the same thing that Google's getting
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.800]  criticized for. And that is they're sticking with 12 megapixel sensors and using computational
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.120]  technology to get past those where other phone cameras are doing these massive 108 megapixel
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.920]  sensors and pixel binning them down. But they're, they're clearly making trade-offs that generate
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:15.280]  the sort of imagery that they want. Right. They're not going to re-ignite the megapixel sensor war
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.120]  from the early years of digital photography. They increased the size of the pixels again this year,
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.560]  right? I mean, that was one of the things and they've been adamant. They didn't even mention
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.640]  it really, but I mean, like from the years when Phil Schiller was doing the camera segment
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:35.360]  introductions, that's more important to getting overall better images than more pixels. Bigger
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:41.440]  pixels is better than more pixels. More light. At a certain point, you know, there's obviously
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:45.680]  a certain point where you, if it was only one or two megapixels, that's not big enough to blow up.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.640]  12 megapixels is pretty big, especially when you consider that it's in a frigging phone.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.240]  And I say this as somebody who wants pixel binning and I want a periscope zoom because I feel like
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.320]  big zoom is the last thing that a traditional camera does that an iPhone still can't do.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:10.160]  But that's, to go from 2.0 with a 52 millimeter equivalent in one year at 2.5 and then now 3.0
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:18.800]  and it's in the smaller 6.1 inch 13 pro, that's pretty good two year over year improvement.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.120]  I look forward to it. You know, it's nice. I've missed having the telephoto lens. Like I said,
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.680]  I didn't miss it as much as I would, I think most years because I didn't travel for most of the year
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.080]  and even when we could travel, I didn't travel much. But I look forward to it for next year.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.320]  I love it. I use it a lot because the natural bokeh you can get off the telephoto without
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:41.280]  even using portrait mode is really nice. Yeah, it really is. And you get that you get more of
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:46.160]  that with a longer lens. Yeah, I do think the other thing that's worth pointing out and Apple
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:53.120]  isn't going to emphasize because they don't want to throw their very nice iPhone 13 and 13 mini
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:28:00.960]  under the bus, but it's not just that the pros have a 3x telephoto lens that the other two don't
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:11.040]  have. The pro models have better 1x and better 0.5x lenses as well. And that's not something
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.520]  Apple points out. Like I said, they're not going to throw one of them under the bus, but
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.520]  it's a pretty significant difference. Yeah, the light capture capabilities on the wide angle are
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.200]  way better. And for the first time, they have focus pixels, which is what Apple calls phase
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.720]  adjust focus. For some reason, right, they have focus pixels in the ultra wide angle,
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:33.360]  which means it can do things that the previous ones couldn't like the macro mode that they've
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:41.280]  introduced, right. So macro mode is pro only. And that's because it uses the 0.5 x lens,
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:48.080]  even though I believe the process of doing it is in the camera app, you pick one x,
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.000]  and then you bring the camera really close to a subject two centimeters is really, really close.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:03.760]  And it will switch to using the 0.5 x ultra wide camera, but you're still in 1x mode in the camera
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:08.880]  in terms of the perspective, you know, in the field of view, but it's to get that close and
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:16.080]  to focus that close, they need to switch to the other camera. And only the pros have an ultra wide
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:22.320]  ultra wide that supports autofocus. And Apple calls it autofocus. But like you said, it's not
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.120]  that's, you know, it's not what you traditionally think of as autofocus. But it definitely has a
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:32.880]  better focusing system. Yeah, I think at the 0.5, one, two x, or three x thing is confusing,
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.120]  because I think people actually think they relate to the cameras, where they really just relate to
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:41.440]  the punch in level. And then behind the scenes, Apple will use whichever camera it needs to get
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.280]  the job done, depending on lightning and all these other conditions. Yeah, ever since they've switched
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.680]  to two camera lenses, the in low light, they will occasionally when you when you think in the UI,
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:57.440]  you're using two x, it just means if it's sufficiently low light that the two x camera
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:02.160]  can't get a good image for the same reason we were just talking about a couple of minutes ago that
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:10.720]  that the longer lenses have less, worse low light capabilities, they'll use the one x camera and
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:15.680]  just digitally zoom to two x and just know that they're going to get a better result. And you
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:20.160]  don't have to worry about it as a user, you just tap the button and do it. It's an implementation
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:30.400]  detail. I am a little interested about I have to say personally, it's it's like a very, very low
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:40.720]  grade OCD, where I like to shoot at exactly 0.5, one point x or two point x or now, you know, next
[01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:49.760]  year 3.0 x, like, I don't like dialing into 2.7 or 2.3. And knowing that it's digital zoom, but I
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:56.480]  think I have to get over that, right? Because now, there is, like, it's great that you can get
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:03.360]  optical zoom up to a 77 millimeter field of view in traditional 35 millimeter photography, what
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:10.080]  they're calling 3.0 x, and that's totally optical from the camera. But it's also the case that the
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:19.600]  two x 52 ish 50 ish traditional standard lens, what photographers call a normal lens, because
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:26.720]  it's like that perspective, supposedly is the closest to human vision, where it doesn't feel
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.320]  wide, and it doesn't feel tele, it just feels totally natural. That's a very good field of
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:36.880]  view, like the compression, like 13 millimeters, you look like Dolby, the house elf, right at
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.560]  120, you look flat, right? And if 50, you look, you expect to look, yeah, normal is it's an
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:51.920]  interesting adjective for it. But it's now to get that normal field of view at 2.0 x in the camera
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:32:02.000]  app, it would be, I presume, using the 1.0 wide angle lens and digitally zooming 2x. Yeah, I
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.240]  think it'll be fine. And I shouldn't worry about it. It'll look fine. The compression will be
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.280]  different. But like, you'll have to be a camera nerd to really notice it, you know, that you're
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.400]  just cropping from the 1.0 view. But it's overall, it's a win. It's good.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:17.360]  Jared Polin 80 millimeters is a very popular portrait.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:22.960]  Yeah, yeah. 85 is often Yeah, 85. And, you know, and they just work out to these equivalents,
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:32.160]  like 77. It's very close. What else was a big camera feature? The cinematic mode? Yeah. Looks
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:38.000]  amazing. Will it work as well as they say? I don't know. But I mean, they're especially with camera
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.440]  stuff. They've never exaggerated, right? Like they've, year after year, what they say iPhone
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:51.120]  cameras can do, they've done pretty good. I mean, we can quibble about them selectively picking
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:57.680]  portrait examples, especially in the early years of portrait mode, that did a much better job
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:04.160]  occluding people's curly hair, then you could get not wearing glasses, not seeing reflections.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.320]  Right, right. glasses were a big problem for years, probably still are to some degree,
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:15.680]  but they've gotten better at it. So I would guess that cinematic mode video will have some things
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.600]  like that. But it's it is super cool that you can edit all of it after the fact. So if it misses
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:29.040]  that sort of, hey, the the subject turned around to look at this other person, rack the focus to
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:35.440]  focus on the other person. If, if the software if the AI doesn't do that, exactly the way you
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:41.200]  thought that it would, you can fix it in post, you know, like with no with no sacrifice other than
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:47.040]  the time it takes you to to go into the editing mode and tweak it. And just the thing like the
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.040]  thing that always impresses me about Apple is a lot of this is just based completely on the power
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:55.280]  of their silicon, which is why they can do these things. And they almost always insist like I think
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.000]  night mode is the biggest exception. They insist on doing this stuff in real time. And we've talked
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.640]  before that I was shocked when I did when I use other camera phones, and depth effect like portrait
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:09.120]  mode was applied as a filter after the photo was taken, where with Apple, you've always just seen
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.200]  it in the viewfinder, you've pressed the button, and it's captured that picture. And here, they're
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.360]  not just applying depth effect to the live frame, but they're measuring the frames before and
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.440]  afterwards, so that the like the book is not changing in between every frame, which would be
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.840]  a horrible look, they're trying to maintain a consistency between them. And the pipeline for
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:30.480]  that and the pipeline for ProRes, at least according to what JAWS was saying during the
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.720]  keynote was it's it's everything from the Apple neural engine to the GPU to the controller for the
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:41.360]  storage, everything has been optimized to take this huge amount of data, which is still limited
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.960]  to 1080p 30 because it's just so much data, and they're crunching it in real time and then adding
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.880]  that as data you can edit into the video files to me is just amazingly impressive and really pays
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.520]  off that investment in the silicon they've been making. Yeah, it seems like the downside to
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:05.120]  cinematic mode is that it's 1080, not 4k. And maximum frame rate of 30 frames per second. It's
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.640]  not clear to me whether it's going to support 24 frames per second. It seems like some of the
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:16.160]  material I've read just says 1080 30 frames per second. Yeah, that would, that's a little weird
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.280]  to me that they literally call it cinematic mode and wouldn't let you shoot 24 frames per second,
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:27.280]  which everybody, most people seem to agree is the most cinematic frame rate. But already
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.960]  tons of complaints on Twitter about that. It was like the first thing that video, the video
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:37.760]  Twitter went crazy about. But for whatever reason, that's really never been clear to me,
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:41.280]  even though I've spoken to people who would know, and it's one of those things, you bring it up,
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.360]  and they totally give you they look you in the eye, and they know that it's a good question.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:51.840]  And then the words coming out of their mouth don't really answer the question. Yeah, but they've
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.120]  they've always supported 24 frames per second at 4k, ever since they've started supporting 4k
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:05.360]  video, but they've never supported 24 frames per second at 1080. I don't understand that,
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.280]  like that, to me is two different things that shouldn't be tied together. Like,
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:18.480]  yeah, why not, if I'm like, shooting something, or if I know I'm low on space, or I'm going to
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:25.600]  shoot tons and tons of video footage, just fill up a 512 gigabyte phone with video footage. So I
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:32.080]  want to shoot 1080. So I can get the most on the phone as possible. Why not let me shoot 24 frames
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:37.760]  per second, because that's the sort of thing you can't fix in post. I mean, you can I mean,
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.400]  you know more about this to me, but you can shoot 30 frames per second and down sample to 24. But
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:50.000]  it it comes out weird, right? Yeah, I mean, like, that's, it's a whole long story. Like I shoot in
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.120]  60 for B roll, because 60 you can divide into 24 or 30, depending on what you need. But otherwise,
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:59.680]  you've got to use one of those things like Final Cut Pro's frame filler, basically optical frame
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.320]  filler, which goes in and tries to recalculate the frames based on the rate. It's super easy to me,
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.080]  it's like I would, I would make a conspiracy theory that Marquez Brownlee got to them and
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:12.320]  convince them to do 30 frames per second, but there's no way he'd shoot in 1080p. So that just
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:16.800]  throws that whole conspiracy theory out the window. Yeah, I would have almost been less
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:22.000]  surprised if they only supported one and only one combination of resolution and frame rate,
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.960]  I would have been less surprised if it was 24 frames per second than 30. Even though I guess
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.040]  about maybe I'm wrong, because 30 is like the broadcast standard. But if you just think about
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:35.920]  it, 24 is more common for movies, and 30 is more common for TV, but only because American TVs ran
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:42.080]  at 60 hertz, that 30 was easily divisible. Right. So let's see if they do a software update for
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.480]  that. But I can't help but wonder if, I don't know, there's some kind of decision inside Apple
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:54.080]  that 1080 never drops to 24, and only 4k does. But it's obvious that the cinematic mode is so
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:01.360]  it processor intensive, or not just processor chip intensive, right? That it's it's computationally
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.160]  expensive, that that's why it's limited to 1080 instead of 4k, that they, you know, it's,
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.600]  that's as much as they can do in real time. I wonder if it's just really simple in that
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.320]  movies aren't 1080p movies need to be bigger than that. And so they have the 24 frames per second
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:22.880]  for 4k. But television is, at least in North America, it's 30 frames per second. So there's
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:27.840]  no 24 frames per second television. So they just pegged 720p and 1080 at 30 frames per second.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:32.560]  Yeah, I don't know, we'll see. That's, that's my only disappointment on that. But I expect to see
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.520]  a lot of this. I hope it I hope it works mostly as good as they say, if it works exactly as well
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:43.440]  as they say, I'm gonna love it. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. We shall see.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.480]  And it's also like, you can manually adjust what you want the like, you can rack focus,
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.600]  basically, you can manually pick what you want, but it'll also detect eyes
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.720]  and focus on whatever the closest set of eyes are. And if those eyes look away,
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:58.320]  it'll go to the next closest set of eyes. And if a closer set of eyes comes back in,
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.720]  it'll then shift to those automatically for you. And like you said, you can change it in post. But
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.520]  if if that's basically what you want, if you want like the the standard cinematography rules
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.040]  of Hollywood implementation, they've given you that automatically. Yeah.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:19.680]  Anything else camera wise? Like the one thing that that irks me in the entire coverage is like Apple
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:24.800]  family, like you said, they didn't talk about the A15 at all with the iPad mini, they didn't mention
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.360]  the processor for the Apple Watch. And they didn't even spend very much time on the A15 compared to
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.640]  what they spent on the A14, like twice last year. And I think that led some people to believe that
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.360]  the A15 was somehow under impressive. And there were some substack articles saying that Apple's
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.600]  hit a wall that there's been this mass exodus of talent, that they're no longer improving their
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:49.200]  processors. And it was stupefying to me because it was it was based off such a flimsy supposition.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.400]  And completely weird thinking, because as far as I can tell, it's going to be a completely normal
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.640]  year. Like they're not getting the massive benefits of a process shrink like they got last year
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:02.800]  when they went to five nanometers. But it'll be and I say this with like no actual knowledge of
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.040]  the chip. I don't I don't have it to test at this point. But like it'll be like the 10% increase
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.040]  that Apple typically gets on a processor. But they're thinking is so far beyond just the cores
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.080]  now. There's only so much you can do with pure cores with the same process given the thermal
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.720]  envelope of the device without having to spike the battery like all these constraints that they
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.320]  have. But what they can do with the with the extra features like the non big core features
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.960]  is limitless. And we're seeing so much of that with cinematic video, which is that whole new
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:38.960]  pipeline and ProRes, which is really a lot of heavy computational work to optimize for in a
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:43.600]  chipset. And we're getting all of that, like all the stuff the neural engine is doing. We've got
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.880]  new encode decode blocks, ProRes encode decode blocks, they've made a dedicated always on
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:53.840]  coprocessor for your fingers so that it will be able to adjust promotion, not just based on the
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.880]  content, but the actual interactivity of your finger at the instant it's doing it. There's all
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.280]  these things in the A15. But there's all these articles and hot takes popping up about how
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.160]  Apple's hit a wall with processors. Nice. I had to get that off my chest.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.200]  And it's it's true, though, right? Who knows? Maybe it is disappointing performance was I don't
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:17.520]  know yet either. I have yet to touch an iPhone 13 of any kind. Oh, so who knows? And it is true.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.400]  Like I saw that substack article. And I guess I take him as word that there have been a lot of
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.520]  great chip engineers who've left Apple for other companies, you know, and that's that happens,
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:34.880]  right? That people leave for other, you know, so who knows? But it seems to me like what Apple knows
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:42.400]  is nobody is talking about their iPhone being slow. Like it's things aren't slow on your iPad.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.560]  And so bragging about the CPU being 100 and you know, 1.3 times faster, whatever the number
[01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:53.600]  turns out to be. That doesn't mean anything to people if they don't feel that they're 1.0
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.960]  speed. That's the baseline is anything but fast with Apple's thinking about our
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.240]  effects of the chip, right? Like you said, like promotion, I mean, so I don't even know how this
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:10.080]  is possible. But I was looking at the battery life spec. So battery life is up across the board for
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:16.960]  all of the iPhone 13. And it's a super big deal for the 13 mini, right? Everybody agrees the
[01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:23.760]  biggest the biggest knock about the 13 mini or 12. Mini was a battery life. You know, for the
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:29.360]  obviously it had a smaller battery because it's a smaller device. And the I forget what factor they
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.200]  say it's up by but it is significant. I think it's like 1.5 hours 1.5 five for the bigger ones,
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:41.280]  right? Yeah, 2.5 for the bigger ones of actual real daily use. And that's one thing talking to
[01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:47.520]  some people yesterday at Apple that they emphasize is that they never quite know how to talk about
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.280]  battery life because you can run certain tests and you know, but what they're trying to do is
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:59.840]  they're trying to say with those numbers that they quoted is they mean real people really using the
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.440]  iPhone in a way like them like the people at Apple who've been testing these iPhone 13 models over
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:11.920]  the summer, when they had them in their pocket as their daily driver. This is how much longer the
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.360]  battery lasted before the phone was dead in typical in their typical use. That is significant
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:23.440]  an hour and a half is pretty good for the mini two and a half is really good for the other ones. I
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:26.720]  don't know if you saw the optimized settings like when you when you look at the actual page when
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.640]  it's optimized tasks like streaming video like when things are hitting the the accelerator
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.840]  blocks. It's hours and hours of extra video watching and video like that was ridiculous
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:41.680]  amounts more. Yeah, the compare page which I always love. Yeah, like the iPhone apple.com slash
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:46.240]  iPhone slash compare and you can pick up to three I always wish you could pick four or more I'd like
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:51.200]  to pick more but it's great for just looking to try to spot the differences between them.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:58.320]  The video max is like 813 and 15 hours more than last year's program. They quote video playback,
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:02.720]  which is a fair comparison, right? Like let's say you're going on a transpacific flight and
[01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:09.600]  you're going to watch movies on your phone the whole time. The pro max 13 pro max is up to 28
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:20.160]  hours, the 13 pro 22 hours, the 1319 hours and the 13 mini 17 hours. Now the thing I don't remember
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:24.800]  what last year's numbers were and I didn't I ran out of research time before we started recording.
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:33.280]  But I find it fascinating that the 13 Pro has three hours longer 22 versus 19 than the same
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:40.000]  sized iPhone 13. When they have the L shaped battery, which gives them a little bit more juice,
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.800]  and it's the same physical form factor, you know, same width, height and depth. But there was a lot
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:54.320]  of speculation that with the pro models getting promotion going to 120 hertz on the display,
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.800]  that I remember seeing a couple articles speculating that the 13 Pro might get worse
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:06.560]  battery life. Yeah, then the 13. And in fact, it's not just equivalent, it's better. One of the
[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.880]  reasons that's certainly true is because of the way promotion works. I don't know, do you know if
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.200]  Android phones with high refresh rates, do they dynamically adjust? Or if you're in high frame
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.160]  rate, you're always 120 hertz. So this is like this whole thing that I think has been vastly
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:25.280]  underreported, because like just doing 120 hertz is not a problem. It's been a lot of the early
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.680]  ones that did it, they had to lower the resolution, because it really did hit battery life, or it
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.520]  would destroy their color management, or it would they would have to change when the brightness level
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:37.600]  changed because they couldn't handle it. Like it was it was a deeply compromised solution.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.520]  The panels Apple using now the process they're using now is similar to what Samsung used for
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:46.960]  the last version of the note. And the most recent galaxy s I think it's the 21. And that's the LTPO
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:53.360]  OLED and LTPO. It's the same thing as Ixo was for LCD. That's when the iPad Pro got promotion. So
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:46:00.240]  that allows it to do all of this stuff much more energy efficiently. And so this, I guess the best
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.080]  way to describe it is the previous implementations were either not very good, or they were at such
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.320]  small scale that they could supply the LTPO panels for it. This is the first time that you'd be able
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.440]  to do it at Apple scale. Right. So it's it's really, you know, the only explanation for the
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:19.520]  13 Pro getting noticeably better battery life than the regular 13 is that it has a bigger battery
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:24.960]  again this year, just like last year. And it can get those numbers for video playback. Because if
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:29.760]  you're watching a movie that again, to bring up frame rate, if it's 24 or 30 frames per second,
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.840]  the screen will dynamically adjust to 24 or 30 hertz so that it's only updating for each frame
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:41.440]  of the video. It doesn't, you know, there's no point to doing it faster. So I thought that
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.960]  dropping you off to an encode block, so you're not lighting up the entire processor the whole time.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.800]  Right. I thought that you know, and that's the sort of thing Apple is putting the chips towards,
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:58.400]  right. And it's like cinematic mode didn't just come out of the software team for the camera app
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:02.720]  when they do features like that. And I've spoken to them, I haven't spoken to anybody on the camera
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:09.040]  team about cinematic mode, but I've spoken to them about portrait mode before that that portrait
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.720]  mode for still photos was designed hand in hand with the ISP team, you know, to have an image.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.080]  So that they could do it live, you know, that it really is I know, like you said, sometimes people
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.720]  don't think that that Apple executives are speaking as plainly as they can. But like,
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.200]  when JAWS talked about that, it really is true that the these features, it's like,
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.960]  we would like to be able to make do the equivalent of portrait mode for video,
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:39.760]  but that it would, you know, it, it's more than just finding a face, it would be, you know,
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:45.360]  being able to rack focus and do it do all this. They've been talking to the chip team for years
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:50.400]  about how can we make that happen so that we can do it in real time, and not affect battery life.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:57.680]  So battery life improvements is a much bigger selling point to almost everybody than being
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:05.360]  able to say that the CPU runs 1.3 times faster and can compute, you know, whatever it is you
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.240]  think you need the CPU to run faster for and I'm not downplay, you know, CPUs need to be faster,
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:13.600]  you know, and JavaScript is slow is a slow programming language. And we all run lots of
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.440]  JavaScript. You know, I like faster CPUs, too, but it just isn't a compelling selling point. So I'm
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:25.120]  not surprised they didn't brag about it, even if there were numbers that would assuage the fears
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.800]  of people who think the A15 is no faster than the A14. The thing that I find interesting to do is
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:34.080]  like marketing will absolutely talk about the speed of the processor. But when you talk to
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.280]  the silicon team, they almost never mentioned speed like they don't mention performance.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.080]  And when you talk to them to they'll almost downplay it, they'll say like, you know,
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.080]  if we had to lose a little bit of frequency to gain a lot of battery life, we'll make that
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:50.720]  trade every day of the week and three times on Sunday, because I think they had this revelation
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.840]  early on, that efficiency creates performance, the more efficiently they can do these things,
[01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.080]  the better the performance. And to your point, I think we're a lot of other companies have made
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.680]  mistakes. It's like, we want faster JavaScript, do we need to make the entire CPU faster? Can we
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:11.040]  have an efficiency core that does that? Can we have a dedicated Java rendering IP on the chip
[01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:15.600]  that takes that away from the CPU, so we can do it way faster, which is what they've been doing.
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.600]  When people talk about Apple's obsessed with performance, they aren't the performance is
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:22.000]  almost a side effect, which makes it even more ludicrous to me.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.040]  John Greenewald I'm trying to think what else before we wrap up,
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:30.720]  whether to talk about the colors, starlight, apparently, again, I haven't seen one in person,
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.880]  but it's it looks silver to me on screen. What I've been told is that it is silver with a touch
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:43.040]  of gold. But perhaps not quite champagne, like champagne would be a description that
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:50.400]  implies too much gold. Midnight, as you might guess from midnight blue is not just a pure black
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:57.680]  or very deep gray. It has a touch of indigo, which is a fancy way of saying blue. I think
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:05.920]  from judging anecdotally from friends and spouses, Sierra blue is going to be a very popular color
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:10.800]  this year. Yeah, yeah, I was joking. Does this mean the iPhone 14 is going to be high Sierra blue?
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.760]  John Greenewald Sierra blue, that would be funny.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.560]  John Greenewald Yeah, also the the the red product
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:20.800]  red this year looks like a little deeper red and blue, the regular blue looks a little more teal.
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.200]  So there every year they seem to refresh the colors slightly.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.880]  John Greenewald Yeah, it seems like blue is a big color this
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:34.080]  year. Even also if we dial back to the watch, it's maybe I'm reading into this. Maybe maybe
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:40.080]  it's something they could have done before. But they just weren't they didn't feel you know,
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.760]  they have we've talked about you and I have talked about this where they have like a color
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:48.880]  team who figures out what the yes, what the popular colors of the moment trend wise are.
[01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:54.400]  But it seems like the green Apple Watch is such a deep green.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:03.840]  I think Tim Cook was wearing it in his interview with iJustine on YouTube. Yeah. And it at first
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:10.960]  looked black. It's such a deep, like olive green. It seems to me like they've really up to their
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:19.040]  game on being able to anodize aluminum in very rich colors. So as opposed to the early years,
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:25.200]  where even like space wasn't all that dark, you know, and the gold was just sort of a gold tint,
[01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:29.280]  and everything was just sort of silver with a tint. Now they've got these colors and the product
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:36.640]  red really pops. I mean, that is like, yes, a really deep red and the green really seems deep
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:40.960]  too. And the blue, all of these colors seem very blue. Now, maybe that's just trend wise. Maybe
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:47.280]  they could have done this a few years ago. But at the time, they felt that fainter tinted colors
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:53.200]  were called for and rich almost pastel for a couple years. Yeah, very much so. Whereas this
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:56.800]  year, they're very, very vibrant, except for the pink. You didn't get a hot pink this year. No,
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:01.200]  kind of a subdued pink. No, which was funny, too. Because I thought that doesn't seem right to me.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:05.520]  And then I realized that I was judging it based on a mock up from like Mac rumors where somebody
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.920]  said they're going to be pink. I would pay Mac rumors money. I would pay a subscription fee
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:18.960]  per month to get a version that never shows me speculative mock ups of products. I don't want
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:22.960]  to see them. It's like I somehow... You should get Arnold Kim on the phone right now.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:29.280]  I somehow thought that they're like sort of Hello Kitty pink phone, which I'm not even saying Apple
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:32.320]  wouldn't make. It might be super popular, but it wasn't what they shipped, you know.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.880]  But somehow... The holograms edition. Somehow it infected my head and I thought it was real.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:40.560]  And I was like, I thought that was going to be more vibrant. And I'm like, oh, that's just a
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.280]  mock up. Or like the matte black iPhone everybody was drooling about. And they got really angry
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:49.120]  that it wasn't at the event. Yeah. Well, what happened to that? I don't know. It seems like
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:55.760]  people... Colors are another one of those things that to me speaks to where in the pipeline leaks
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.520]  come from. They come from like the CAD stage and don't come from the product marketing stage.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:06.880]  And colors are always... I would say that was probably the thing that the rumors
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.640]  were the most off on, other than the flat sided Apple watch.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.440]  Yeah. And the people who know what the final products are and not the people who leak,
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.800]  those are people like in the product marketing. Those are the deep Apple people.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.560]  No plastic wrap this year on the phones. Apparently they just come in cardboard boxes
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:29.280]  that are not sealed. You just lift them up and that they're going to save 600 million tons of
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.920]  plastic, which seems bananas to me, right? Because I feel like with all the review units I got last
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.000]  year, I got like four review units and then I bought a phone and my wife bought a phone. So
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.840]  we had like six new iPhones and it doesn't feel like you could ever get to 600 million tons with
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.320]  the plastic wrap, but it adds up, obviously. Well, you know, the ASMR people are going to be
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.480]  so angry at Apple right now. Oh yeah. Because it's nothing. There's got to be nothing to
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:59.360]  crinkle. Oh no, maybe, maybe there's a screen cover. I bet they've got a screen cover. I don't
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:02.080]  know. Or maybe they can just get some aluminum foil and crinkle that in the background.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:08.080]  The other thing I guess we would be remiss not to mention is that they've bumped up the Mac,
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:14.720]  the minimum storage even on, and this is the best part. I love it that it's true for the iPhone 13
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:24.000]  non-pro. 128 gigabytes to start, 256, 512, and then the pro models come in a whopping one terabyte
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:31.840]  size, which for the Pro Max costs $1,600. Moving the minimum storage from 64 to 128 is great.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:37.120]  And I would have, not following rumors, I just would have bet against it because I would have
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:44.000]  thought maybe next year. Famously, Apple held on to the 16 gigabyte minimum size for ridiculous
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.160]  ridiculously long to mine. Well, they do it until it becomes too, until the people stop
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:52.000]  manufacturing the smaller sizes enough that it becomes more expensive to make smaller sizes.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.520]  You think that's what it is? I thought maybe that's usually how it works. I was giving them
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:00.560]  credit for being generous, but it is nice that it compared to year over year, you get double
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:05.760]  the storage for the same starting prices for all of these phones. Which seems like when you,
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:08.800]  if you talk to somebody on the supply side who goes through this stuff, there are a lot of
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.600]  volume purchasers like an enterprise and other places that just want the cheapest iPhone. They
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:17.520]  use them as web front ends. They do not care at all about what's on board in terms of specs.
[01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:22.400]  All they are for salespeople or other people to like logistics on the road. And if Apple made 16
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.120]  gigabyte one, they would still buy that as long as it was cheaper. I do think though, the nice
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:32.480]  thing about going to 128 baseline storage is that I think for an awful lot of people, the majority
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.560]  of people, that is a fine size. And that's rarely the case for an Apple product that the entry model
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:46.480]  storage is enough storage to recommend. But even if you're shooting recreationally 4k video,
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.160]  you could go pretty long, especially with iCloud photos to keep your whole library in the cloud.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.640]  But you could take a whole week long vacation and shoot lots and lots of 4k video and you'd still
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:02.080]  have room to spare on 128 gigabytes, which is to me is great. You do lose the ProRes 4k at 128
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:06.240]  gigabytes though, just because the bit rate and file size are too big. But I don't think people
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:12.080]  using ProRes are going to go for 128. No, right? No way. Yeah. If you're, if you know what ProRes
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:17.920]  is, and yet have made a reasoned decision that you would like to shoot it, there is no way you
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:24.480]  also know that 128 gigabytes is going to vanish in like a minute or two. And like what you said,
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:29.600]  like the one terabyte iPhone $1600. There are going to be a bunch of articles written about how
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:35.280]  crazy it is that there is 100 $1600 iPhone a terabyte, the people who are buying that
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.000]  are not paying that is being charged to clients. It's being paid by their studios. It is it is
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.480]  cheap for a video camera that can do what the iPhone can do. Because video cameras cost thousands
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.000]  and thousands of dollars. So it's a complete inversion of what a lot of people expect the
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:54.400]  market to be. I think that there is an enthusiast level people like us, who have it in their head
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:58.960]  that they're they love the iPhone. And it's this thing they splurge on every year for themselves.
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:05.200]  And they really do want to get the best one. Like I said, like lowercase OCD, like a small
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  grade OCD that it'll eat in the back of some people's minds that they've only only got 256
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.040]  when 512 and now one terabyte are available. But the truth is, they've increased these
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:24.560]  for professional purposes to a point that people don't need. I only have 256 gigabytes. I mean,
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:30.400]  it's it. Yeah. And it does not. I forgot, I'm trying to look up how much storage I have,
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.320]  you need to shoot a lot of progress to justify a terabyte iPhone. And when you're shooting that
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:38.720]  much progress, you don't have to justify a terabyte. Yeah, live on the show. I'm calculating
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:44.960]  my iPhone 12 storage after like, I'll do the same 11 months. Boy, the other rumor that didn't pay
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.880]  remember there was so much ink spilt about how Apple is gonna have to hike the price of the
[01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:54.880]  iPhone 13. Oh, yeah, MC was right doing it. And Apple bakes the stuff in like so far ahead. And
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.200]  they buy so many premium device chips from like, that was just never gonna happen. But it got so
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:04.400]  much airplay. Yeah, if anything comes out of that, that's that's like a years down the line thing.
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.840]  That's the next process. That's like four or three nanometer problem. Yeah, iPhone storage 104
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:17.600]  gigabytes of 256 gigabytes used mostly apps, some photos, because I have iCloud photos on and so
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.960]  it doesn't keep my photo library there. And I've got well over half my storage available if I want
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.040]  to leave for vacation and start shooting 4k video right now. So I have 508 gigabytes out of 512
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.640]  available and I use my iPhone a lot. It's just all on iCloud is all it doesn't stay on the local
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:41.360]  device. Right? So really, at the starting price 128 I guess I wouldn't I wouldn't I guess I
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.840]  wouldn't buy that for myself, but I buy 256. But I would encourage like my most of my family members
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:49.600]  that 128 is probably fine for them. And anybody can check. So
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.360]  yeah, I mean, I think there's it's counterintuitive, because a lot of people assume
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.440]  that we're becoming more of a digital society and we're accumulating more stuff. But we're becoming
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:01.840]  an online digital society where we're streaming more and more stuff, tick talking, Instagramming,
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:05.920]  YouTube being more and more stuff, which doesn't take up a lot of local storage. So I think it's
[01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:11.440]  on on some people aren't using as much as they used to use. Yeah. Anything else as we wrap up?
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:16.480]  I will say, I think that the only thing I can think of, well, the only thing I can think of is,
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:24.160]  again, to touch on rumors, which is maybe not accurate at all. The rumor is that next year,
[01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:29.120]  they're going to drop the mini from the lineup of new phones. So let's just presume for the sake of
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:34.720]  argument that we're talking about the iPhones 14, that they would drop the mini and have the two
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:45.360]  and have the two tiers would be 6.1 and 6.7. And so instead of having only the consumer level one
[01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:52.480]  has a mini there is no mini Pro and only the pro tier one has a max sized phone, they would both
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:58.240]  there'd be one phone that 6.1 one phone that 6.7 or maybe those numbers are slightly different one
[01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:05.280]  big ass phone, one regular sized phone for consumers, same sizes for pro. I think there's
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.000]  two interesting things about that. I think that I'm still holding out hope and people who don't
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:13.760]  like the mini people who think the mini is a failure, you know, tell me that it's just
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:18.720]  wishful thinking. But I still think that as people can actually see it in stores, and now that the
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:23.200]  word might get out that the battery life is better, that the mini might become more popular
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:28.400]  than it apparently was last year. That doesn't mean though that that their plans aren't already locked
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.880]  in their plans are probably close to locked in at this point for a year from now. But I think the
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.880]  more interesting part of that is that they would no longer be charging $1,100 to start for the big
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:45.040]  ass size. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I think they're like, right. Like the smartphone market has matured at
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:48.320]  this point. So you got to start treating it like the car market, which means that you start creating
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:52.800]  segmented products to appeal to different types of users. And it was absolutely worth the experiment
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:57.760]  because the original iPhone SE was both smaller and less expensive. And then this time they split
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:03.360]  those two. So the SE2 was less expensive and the mini was smaller, but basically the same price as
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.080]  a full-fledged iPhone. And it turned out that that's not enough of a market. Like when you
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.680]  put those two things together, they're a big market. When you take them apart, there's a lot
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.480]  of people who buy a cheap iPhone, but I think it's mostly, I don't want to say US centric, but
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.720]  for a lot of people in the rest of the world, the phone is their primary computer and it behooves
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.880]  them to have a bigger screen to get more done with. But I think it was a unique intersection
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:30.000]  where tech Twitter, tech YouTube, people who work in human interface design and at Apple really
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.360]  love that form factor. And so they, they decided to test it. Yeah. And I look at the pricing and
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:44.960]  you can see exactly where the iPhone 14, not pro max would fit in right. The iPhone 13 starts at
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:51.040]  $800 and that's ignoring the $29 carrier thing that you have to pay, but let's just call it,
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:57.760]  let's just go with Apple's price and call it $800. The 13 pro is not $900. It's a thousand
[02:01:57.760 --> 02:02:04.960]  dollars. So there's that $100 more than the regular 13 or a hundred dollars less than the
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:15.120]  smaller 13 pro price point, just waiting for a big giant ass consumer grade iPhone 14 that I think
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.800]  would prove phenomenally popular and all of the arguments about how many fussy people like John
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.560]  Moltz just love the mini. I think in the mass market, we all have to face facts. People love
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:31.120]  big ass phones and they don't care about some, but some of these people don't really care about
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:36.800]  fancy pro cameras. You know what they like a big screen, big screen. If Moltz would Jamie Maddox
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.080]  himself into 50 million people, he wouldn't have this problem. He's just not committed.
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:45.760]  Renee, I think if it was any other year, like if next year was any normal year,
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.360]  I think they would drop the price of the regular iPhone a hundred bucks to take it back down to
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:55.840]  pre 5g pre OLED levels and then slide the bigger screen one into like on top of that. So you get
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.280]  like a little bit of price relief on the iPhone. But I think because components are going to
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.080]  continue to go up, it's going to be exactly what you just said it's going to be. Well,
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:07.280]  the other thing I expect as years go on is I expect even more segmentation and camera features
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.320]  between the pro and non pro versions. And so that's why I kind of feel like there's room
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:17.440]  for that gap where it's like, wait, why would I buy the regular 13 pro when I could get a bigger
[02:03:17.440 --> 02:03:23.440]  screen for less? And it's literally the pro features, you know, and some investors were
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.440]  so cranky that the price didn't go up. They were so hoping that Apple would test upward
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:32.720]  elasticity on the pricing again. Yeah, I think there's an awful lot of other people who are
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.600]  just just happy that they didn't. And those are the absolutely those are the people out there
[02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:42.000]  who've already queued up their pre orders for Friday and have like one button to click and
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.320]  are ready to charge their phones. They're like, No, no, I'm good. I'm good with not testing
[02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.800]  upwards, upwards of higher, higher starting prices. Anyway, Renee, thank you so much for
