[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  We're in luck though, Dan, I mean it's, we've been, we've both been in this
[00:03.200 --> 00:07.360]  racket a long time, and in the years since Macworld,
[00:07.360 --> 00:12.240]  rest in peace, pour one out for old Macworld, January announcements
[00:12.240 --> 00:16.800]  have been few and far between. It's usually sort of a dead zone before
[00:16.800 --> 00:19.680]  spring, which I think honestly is one of the
[00:19.680 --> 00:22.640]  reasons, one of the, yeah, Apple was not going to stick with
[00:22.640 --> 00:24.880]  Macworld Expo for long anyway, they want to,
[00:24.880 --> 00:31.520]  they were shifting from a, we're one of many companies
[00:31.520 --> 00:35.360]  in, in this industry, and we do things that normal companies
[00:35.360 --> 00:43.440]  in this industry do to, we're Apple. Right? Yeah, my, my favorite story about
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.400]  the year we were at Macworld Expo when Apple had pulled out,
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.400]  I was actually doing a talk on the show floor with our pals,
[00:50.400 --> 00:54.960]  Paul Kvass's John Moltz, and a guy stopped us after our, after our little
[00:54.960 --> 00:58.000]  talk on the floor, and he was from Germany, and he asked us
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.800]  where the Apple booth was, and we're like, sorry, bad news, and in
[01:02.800 --> 01:05.600]  the year since, I think Paul ad-libbed this, but he had the,
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.400]  but I have flown all the way from Germany to see the Apple booth.
[01:10.400 --> 01:13.760]  He just looked very forlorn, he was, we were like, sorry to break it to you,
[01:13.760 --> 01:17.760]  there's an Apple store, you can walk there, it's pretty much the same thing.
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.240]  It was very sad, sad but funny at the same time.
[01:22.240 --> 01:26.000]  Apple, you know, who knows, we might still get some springtime announcements.
[01:26.000 --> 01:30.560]  In recent years, there's often been something in the March-April
[01:30.560 --> 01:35.200]  time frame, you know, and, and because they don't have these
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.320]  set in stone conferences like Macworld to worry about, they,
[01:40.320 --> 01:43.360]  you know, they just announce them when they're ready, and if it's, you know, the
[01:43.360 --> 01:46.160]  last week of March, or it's the second week of April, it
[01:46.160 --> 01:50.320]  doesn't matter, there's no tradition. Really, the only two things that seem to
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.360]  be on a dead set annual schedule are WWDC,
[01:55.360 --> 01:59.120]  somewhere in, like, with a starting date on a
[01:59.120 --> 02:04.080]  Monday with single digits in June, right, might be the first Monday, might be the
[02:04.080 --> 02:07.600]  second Monday, but it probably starts with a single digit,
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.920]  and an iPhone event in, like, the first Tuesday after Labor Day
[02:13.920 --> 02:17.120]  in September, roughly, you know, one of those first
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.280]  Tuesdays in September, and everything else has some float that's
[02:21.280 --> 02:26.080]  based on their schedule, but I can't help but think that when
[02:26.080 --> 02:29.680]  they did pull the pull on, pull the plug on Macworld, or their
[02:29.680 --> 02:33.680]  participation in Macworld, January is just never a good month for Apple.
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.040]  It just, it's just not, you know, why, why in the world would you come out with new
[02:37.040 --> 02:40.560]  stuff in January? On the whole, right, because you
[02:40.560 --> 02:45.280]  want to get it out for the holidays, else you don't want to spend your holidays
[02:45.280 --> 02:47.520]  preparing getting something out, but here we are.
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.840]  Right, yeah, well, it was weird, too, because, I mean, also in the past, like, you know,
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.400]  Macworld and CES always collided, like, and that was kind of weird, and it felt
[02:56.400 --> 02:59.920]  like maybe, yeah, you want to be it, like, be in the
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.040]  CES time frame, but they weren't usually at CES, or even if they were,
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.200]  they weren't doing anything official there,
[03:05.200 --> 03:08.320]  and, you know, as you said, like, you don't want to
[03:08.320 --> 03:11.600]  do stuff after the holiday quarter. This one is a little weird, too, because, like,
[03:11.600 --> 03:15.440]  the, the supposition around it seems to be that they wanted to do it in the fall.
[03:15.440 --> 03:19.120]  Yeah. Like, that it just wasn't ready to go, so
[03:19.120 --> 03:22.080]  they pushed it off to, you know, the next best time, I guess, when
[03:22.080 --> 03:24.000]  they're, whenever they're ready to ship in the
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.480]  quantities they need to, which was January. Yeah, I pointed out, I think I
[03:28.480 --> 03:31.280]  might have been first, and I'm never first for anything anymore, but
[03:31.280 --> 03:38.400]  that the URL for the event video had, like, two 2022s
[03:38.400 --> 03:44.240]  in it. Somebody else once, somebody else would have noticed that
[03:44.240 --> 03:47.760]  anyway, but once the internet was off to the races on
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.640]  that, some people looked at the, those AR
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.520]  widgets. I don't know what we call, what do we call those things? Whenever they
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.520]  come out with a new product, and there's, like,
[03:57.520 --> 04:02.640]  hey, you know, you can pretend you have, is there a word? Yeah, I don't know, but
[04:02.640 --> 04:04.960]  it's, like, they, they make little, when they make new,
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.160]  you know, it's like a tradition they've been doing for several years now. It's
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.520]  not just, like, oh, it's because the headset's imminent, but for several years
[04:11.520 --> 04:14.720]  they have a new product. They'll put these, they'll make these AR
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.560]  models of the thing, whatever it is, and then you can use your
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.800]  phone and project it onto a tabletop in front of you, and anyway, somebody,
[04:22.800 --> 04:25.920]  you know, poked around those AR models and,
[04:25.920 --> 04:29.520]  or scenes, maybe they, you'd call them AR scenes, but it's really more, that sounds
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.720]  right, but it's not really a scene. It's, like, putting a virtual object in front of
[04:32.720 --> 04:35.920]  you. Yeah, anyway, they were compiled, if
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.640]  that's the right verb, in, like, October 11th, and
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.720]  people who look at such things snooping for details
[04:44.720 --> 04:51.680]  claim that almost inevitably those AR models' final compilation date is
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.920]  within, like, the final week of the event or when they come out,
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.640]  which leads, you know, you know, and it is interesting. Anyway, the
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.240]  products we're talking about are the new
[05:04.240 --> 05:12.560]  M2 MacBook Pros, the real MacBook Pros, 14 and 16 inch, with the M2 Pro and M2
[05:12.560 --> 05:19.040]  Max chips and the M2 Mac Minis, which aren't quite
[05:19.040 --> 05:22.480]  limited to the Pro and Max, because there's also
[05:22.480 --> 05:27.760]  the just plain M2 Mac Mini. It's all, it's not confusing when you lay
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.240]  it out. It's a little confusing to talk about,
[05:30.240 --> 05:36.560]  and, yeah, yeah, well, and HomePod second generation, which
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.560]  will, and HomePods, yeah, right, so everybody knew, everybody knew
[05:40.560 --> 05:45.280]  that the MacBook Pros were going to move to the M2.
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.200]  I, you know, that was money in the bank. I think that the first
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.240]  14 and 16 inch M1 Pro and Max MacBook Pros were so well received
[05:54.240 --> 06:00.080]  and were a hardware refresh, it's unsurprising that they are true
[06:00.080 --> 06:04.320]  speed bumps in the classical sense where it's almost impossible to tell them
[06:04.320 --> 06:07.920]  apart other than by booting them up and going
[06:07.920 --> 06:11.040]  to about this Mac to see what the hell chip is inside.
[06:11.040 --> 06:16.640]  The Mac Mini was more, a little bit more of a question mark, right,
[06:16.640 --> 06:19.040]  because,
[06:20.480 --> 06:24.240]  you know, the Intel one was hanging around there for a little while. I mean,
[06:24.240 --> 06:27.200]  they had that M1, and so it seemed logical, obviously,
[06:27.200 --> 06:29.680]  that you get an M2, but then the question was,
[06:29.680 --> 06:33.280]  why is there an Intel still? What are you doing with that?
[06:33.280 --> 06:36.560]  Right, and it's, you know, this is why it's fun to have a podcast in this space,
[06:36.560 --> 06:39.360]  because it gave us plenty to talk about, but the basic thinking
[06:39.360 --> 06:43.520]  is, okay, the old way, and there's a, you know, very clear
[06:43.520 --> 06:47.040]  division between old and new, which is for going from Intel
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.920]  to Apple Silicon, the old Intel way, at the very end, it was only for, like,
[06:51.920 --> 06:56.320]  maybe the last three years, two years of the product life, but they
[06:56.320 --> 07:00.560]  effectively had two versions of the Mac Mini,
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.000]  which I would describe, they didn't call it the Mac Mini Pro,
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.120]  but I'll say with a lowercase p, not as a product name, but just as an adjective,
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.360]  there was the Pro version with four USB ports, or Thunderbolt ports,
[07:13.360 --> 07:18.000]  whatever the hell they are, and the lower end version with only two
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.080]  ports, and at the end of the Intel era, they were all, they were easily
[07:22.080 --> 07:25.440]  discerned, because the higher end ones with four
[07:25.440 --> 07:30.000]  ports were space gray, and lower end ones were silver, aluminum,
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.760]  same footprint, but more ports, and a cooler space, in my
[07:33.760 --> 07:39.440]  opinion, cooler space, great color, and if you're a man, and at lots and
[07:39.440 --> 07:42.560]  lots of, you know, there's lots of people who just buy a Mac Mini
[07:42.560 --> 07:46.640]  as a consumer, and hook it up to a display, and it's there, that's their
[07:46.640 --> 07:50.160]  desktop Mac, and then, you know, as Apple is now very happy
[07:50.160 --> 07:57.440]  to point out, there's lots of professional uses of the Mac Mini,
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.120]  audio and video production, and the Mac Mini
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.240]  co-location with companies like Mac Stadium,
[08:04.240 --> 08:07.440]  who are not sponsoring this episode, but have sponsored my show for years and
[08:07.440 --> 08:10.240]  years, great company, where you might have lots
[08:10.240 --> 08:14.240]  and lots of Mac Minis together, I can't help but think the color coding
[08:14.240 --> 08:18.080]  was a nice something, you know, a nice little way of
[08:18.080 --> 08:20.800]  knowing what you're looking at, if you're looking at like three or four of them,
[08:20.800 --> 08:27.440]  or a dozen of them altogether. Yeah, yeah, well, I think it hits the
[08:27.440 --> 08:29.920]  nail on the head, which is that essentially it was two products, and I
[08:29.920 --> 08:33.440]  think that's, the through line has continued, you know,
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.040]  now to the M2 and M2 Pro variants, that it's
[08:37.040 --> 08:39.920]  essentially like your low-cost intro level computer, which is what the
[08:39.920 --> 08:43.600]  Mac Mini was originally introduced as, when they, you know, came out with it
[08:43.600 --> 08:47.600]  almost 20 years ago, was like, hey, we need to convert PC users,
[08:47.600 --> 08:50.960]  here's a cheap, which was at the time kind of, I think,
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.280]  unprecedented for Apple, like, let's make a cheap
[08:55.280 --> 08:58.320]  entry-level computer, and not say it's cheap in terms of the way it's put
[08:58.320 --> 09:02.880]  together, but like, it's at a low cost, which is not a market that
[09:02.880 --> 09:06.320]  Apple traditionally played in, they were not competing with a $500 Dell
[09:06.320 --> 09:09.520]  that you bought, they were playing in the $1,000 plus space,
[09:09.520 --> 09:12.640]  and so, you know, they cut their costs by not having it, doesn't have a display,
[09:12.640 --> 09:15.760]  doesn't come with a keyboard, doesn't come with a pointy device of any kind,
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.440]  and so, you know, that was always sort of like, hey, you claim Macs are too
[09:19.440 --> 09:22.880]  expensive, well, here's one for, you know, 500 bucks that you can get. Yeah, use it
[09:22.880 --> 09:24.960]  with whatever keyboard you have laying around, or
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.200]  buy a cheap third-party keyboard if you want, or whatever.
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.640]  Yeah, I guess, you know, we now know the answer,
[09:32.640 --> 09:39.120]  so we're working backwards, but it was an open question with the existence of
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.880]  the Mac Studio from last year, whether they ever would do the more
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.280]  pro-tier Mac Mini again, because the M1 version
[09:49.280 --> 09:52.320]  had no pro variant, it only had a two-port
[09:52.320 --> 09:56.640]  version, it came, you know, the specs ranged a little bit within the M1
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.080]  range, but, you know, only up to wherever the M1
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.640]  went without being the M1 Pro, or whatever, and I guess the question
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.480]  was, does the Mac Studio start right above that, and that's why,
[10:12.480 --> 10:18.480]  or were they going to do this? Well, they, you know, obviously wanted to. Why they
[10:18.480 --> 10:23.600]  didn't have a four-port version in the M1 generation is one of
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.160]  those things we'll never get an answer to, but...
[10:28.160 --> 10:31.280]  Yeah, I feel like they fell prey to timing a little bit on that one, just
[10:31.280 --> 10:35.840]  because the M1 Mini came out at the same time when the M1 debuted, right? It was
[10:35.840 --> 10:38.160]  the first one with the Air to make the transition,
[10:38.160 --> 10:42.000]  so they obviously didn't have the M1 Pro ready to go at that point, that didn't
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.760]  happen for another nine months. Right, and I...
[10:45.760 --> 10:49.200]  Yeah, mid-stream is weird to change it, too.
[10:49.200 --> 10:53.440]  And I wonder, you know, and again, this is one of those things Apple never makes
[10:53.440 --> 10:57.520]  excuses about everything that happened during COVID, or even the continuing to
[10:57.520 --> 11:00.960]  this day supply chain repercussions of that
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.600]  whole stretch. Was that, if COVID hadn't happened, might
[11:05.600 --> 11:12.240]  there have been a M1 Pro Mac Mini when
[11:12.240 --> 11:16.880]  the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros were first introduced
[11:16.880 --> 11:23.160]  a year after the M1 Mac Mini, maybe? You know, I just wonder if their
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.040]  prioritization of, we're only going to make so many of
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.800]  these M2 Pro chips, we've got to allocate them all to the
[11:30.800 --> 11:34.080]  MacBook Pros. The MacBook Pro is, you know,
[11:34.080 --> 11:37.520]  Apple loves the Mac Mini more than they've ever loved it in its entire
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.360]  existence, but clearly, but let's face it, the MacBook...
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.720]  It's not the MacBook Pro! It's not the MacBook Pro! That's like the flagship,
[11:44.720 --> 11:49.040]  right? Right, the flagship Macs are the MacBook Pros, the real ones, the 14 and
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.960]  16-inch, and the fly, and the the tried and true
[11:52.960 --> 11:56.960]  single most important Mac in the world is the MacBook Air.
[11:56.960 --> 12:01.200]  Everything after that is second fiddle at best, even if it's
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.280]  getting love, so I don't know. It, you know, the one, the other thing Apple
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.600]  definitely has always done is they hold spots in the lineup when
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.400]  they want to come back to them, even when it gets awkward, so
[12:14.400 --> 12:18.720]  I thought that continuing to sell the Intel 4-port
[12:18.720 --> 12:22.640]  Mac Mini up until these machines came out,
[12:22.640 --> 12:26.240]  I thought it was more of a sign that they were going to
[12:26.240 --> 12:30.880]  eventually fill that spot in with a Mac Mini with Apple Silicon, which is what
[12:30.880 --> 12:35.040]  they've done, and not about,
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.080]  we need something, we need to keep selling something
[12:38.080 --> 12:42.800]  Intel-based that's not crazy expensive like the Mac
[12:42.800 --> 12:49.920]  Pro. Something in that price range for our pro people who have,
[12:49.920 --> 12:54.800]  for whatever reason, they need Intel, you know, that they're, it's scientific
[12:54.800 --> 13:00.160]  computing, and they're using Intel compilers, or just they need to
[13:00.160 --> 13:03.920]  plug and play with an Intel
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.680]  workflow that they've already got, who knows? I, you know,
[13:07.680 --> 13:10.720]  I think it was a nice side effect. I think it's primarily just that they
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.800]  wanted to hold the spot, and they always wanted to fill it with Apple Silicon.
[13:14.800 --> 13:18.320]  Yeah, yeah, I mean if they just, if they had been moving to something else, you
[13:18.320 --> 13:20.720]  know, like the Mac Studio or something, I think they would have had no qualms
[13:20.720 --> 13:23.600]  about just discontinuing that Intel Mac Mini. I think they just
[13:23.600 --> 13:25.360]  would have been like, see, here's the Mac Mini,
[13:25.360 --> 13:28.800]  it's an M1, that's it, and people would have been like, I guess that's the
[13:28.800 --> 13:30.880]  writing's on the wall for that higher-end
[13:30.880 --> 13:35.040]  Mac Mini, and I don't think they have so much nostalgia, I don't know, nostalgia's not
[13:35.040 --> 13:38.240]  quite the right term, but I don't think Apple cares enough about
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.920]  Intel, like, to want to leave one around just for that,
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.440]  you know, safety's sake, or what have you. I don't think they, they really care. I
[13:45.440 --> 13:48.560]  think they want it to be an all-in on Apple Silicon, obviously, and, you know,
[13:48.560 --> 13:51.600]  that's what we're seeing now, with the exception, the asterisk of
[13:51.600 --> 13:55.520]  Mac Pro. So having that there, I think you're totally right, was like a
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.960]  placeholder for, this is coming, it's just not, it's not
[13:58.960 --> 14:03.120]  ready yet. And it, but it was weird too, because it left this weird gap
[14:03.120 --> 14:06.240]  in the lineup when the Mac Studio did come out, right, because
[14:06.240 --> 14:09.760]  you could buy an M1, and it would be, you know, I think it
[14:09.760 --> 14:12.960]  went up in the, what, close to a thousand, if you sort of maxed out your M1 Mac
[14:12.960 --> 14:17.040]  Mini, or whatever, maybe slightly over, and then it was like, you got to go all the
[14:17.040 --> 14:20.400]  way to the Mac Studio, which is two grand, you know, for a base-level
[14:20.400 --> 14:23.600]  configuration, and everyone's like, well, you know, if I want something better than
[14:23.600 --> 14:26.160]  an M1, but I don't want to drop two thousand
[14:26.160 --> 14:31.280]  dollars on a M1 Mac, Mac Studio, there's nothing, there's nothing in that
[14:31.280 --> 14:34.720]  area at all in Apple Silicon, which will always felt weird, and it felt like
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.560]  another compelling reason that there would be a higher-end Mac Mini, is
[14:38.560 --> 14:43.760]  just to bridge that slightly. Yeah, I thought so too. So you wrote
[14:43.760 --> 14:48.000]  for Six Colors, the, you handled the Mac Mini, Jason Snell
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.440]  handled the MacBook Pro, how would you summarize your review of
[14:51.440 --> 14:55.360]  the Mac Mini? I think what the most important thing
[14:55.360 --> 14:57.840]  about the Mac Mini is, kind of like you described the MacBook
[14:57.840 --> 15:02.320]  Pro as a speed bump, this is exactly what you, we kind of expected, right?
[15:02.320 --> 15:05.760]  Like we said, the Mac Mini is two products, it's that lower-end Mac, but
[15:05.760 --> 15:08.720]  it's also this pro-level Mac, and of course, the ones they sent out to
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.960]  reviewers were the M2 Pros, which is on my desk here, so, you know,
[15:12.960 --> 15:18.480]  it's an attempt to sort of provide a professional-level desktop
[15:18.480 --> 15:21.840]  that is somewhere in between, usually you need something more than an
[15:21.840 --> 15:25.840]  vanilla M2, and nothing, not as much as a Mac Studio,
[15:25.840 --> 15:29.120]  but the Mac, you know, unlike the Mac Studio, the Mac Mini has been around so
[15:29.120 --> 15:32.000]  long that Apple's gotten really good, right? Like they, they know
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.160]  what this device is, they know what this product is,
[15:34.160 --> 15:39.360]  they've made it for over 20 years, and it's not going to surprise you, right, in
[15:39.360 --> 15:42.320]  terms of what it's offering, right? The specs are pretty
[15:42.320 --> 15:46.240]  much, you know, exactly what we expected, but it
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.440]  delivers on all of that, and I will say the, it really impressed
[15:49.440 --> 15:55.040]  me, the performance of the M2 Pro. I have an M1 Air, that's what I was
[15:55.040 --> 15:57.520]  using as sort of my daily driver before this,
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.440]  and, you know, the M2 Pro kind of knocks its socks off in a bunch of different
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.200]  directions, and then I think one of the, you know, it
[16:05.200 --> 16:08.560]  does it in not only handily, but also super quietly,
[16:08.560 --> 16:10.800]  that's the thing that, if that really impressed me about this,
[16:10.800 --> 16:14.640]  is like, I was running tests where I was like, you know, getting all the CPUs,
[16:14.640 --> 16:17.920]  all the performance cores, you know, maxing them out, whatever, running graphics
[16:17.920 --> 16:20.160]  tests, I swear I never heard the fan on this
[16:20.160 --> 16:24.640]  thing, it is so quiet, it's, it's kind of bananas that they, like, I
[16:24.640 --> 16:27.600]  checked at one point and downloaded an app, I'm like, there is a fan in this,
[16:27.600 --> 16:31.920]  right? Like, let me make sure. One of my,
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.280]  one of my favorite reviews was iJustine's on YouTube,
[16:37.280 --> 16:42.080]  and she, I don't have it handy, but she invited a friend of hers who's a,
[16:42.080 --> 16:47.920]  out in Los Angeles, a professional colorist, color grading expert for video,
[16:47.920 --> 16:51.840]  and they were grading
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.360]  4k or 8k footage, I don't know, but it might have been 8k footage,
[16:55.360 --> 17:01.600]  and very, very, just, just a stressful, stressful test, and
[17:01.600 --> 17:06.080]  watching some of the video pros like her and MKBHD
[17:06.080 --> 17:10.560]  is, for me, a great way of getting practical feedback from people who
[17:10.560 --> 17:17.120]  really push machines in ways that typically would engage fans
[17:17.120 --> 17:20.640]  without artificial benchmarks, and it was, the funniest part of the video was
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.080]  her and her friend after they'd went through it, and they were impressed by
[17:24.080 --> 17:26.640]  the performance, they weren't waiting for anything,
[17:26.640 --> 17:30.240]  and then they were, like, trying to figure out if the fans were on.
[17:30.240 --> 17:34.720]  That's, yeah, right, yeah, and the guy was like, I think it is, and she's like, no,
[17:34.720 --> 17:37.680]  that's the key light, and he, like, listen, he's like, oh, you're
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.880]  right, you know, they had, like, a light in front of their studio, and he's like,
[17:40.880 --> 17:43.520]  yeah, it's up there, that's the light, and he's like, yeah, I don't think it's,
[17:43.520 --> 17:46.480]  it's like, you don't know, and it's like, you think, well, it's, I don't know, it's
[17:46.480 --> 17:51.520]  got to be, we were just, we were just crushing this thing.
[17:51.520 --> 17:55.360]  I put my Apple Watch, like, the decibel meter up to the back of it to see if it
[17:55.360 --> 17:57.360]  would make a difference, couldn't tell it, and I had the same thing where I'm
[17:57.360 --> 17:59.520]  listening, like, okay, I hear something, it's like, no, that's my
[17:59.520 --> 18:02.240]  synology in the corner, like, it's not even,
[18:02.240 --> 18:05.920]  it's not even coming from this area. It's,
[18:05.920 --> 18:09.440]  it's good. I do think, you know, I think that your M1
[18:09.440 --> 18:14.320]  Air is probably, I would define as the baseline, that would be, like, the 1.0
[18:14.320 --> 18:21.280]  or the squared is a zero on, you know, the, the
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.280]  rating scale for Apple Silicon, that's the baseline for Apple Silicon, it's a
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.640]  great machine, and we're, you know, to me, it's impressive
[18:28.640 --> 18:32.400]  that as much as we raved about the just plain
[18:32.400 --> 18:37.840]  non-pro M1 Macs from 2020 and to 2020, and how,
[18:37.840 --> 18:42.480]  what a breakthrough they were in performance, and
[18:42.480 --> 18:48.800]  the ways that you really can see, you could feel and measure the
[18:48.800 --> 18:53.040]  benefits of unified memory architecture, and
[18:53.040 --> 18:58.960]  that having this memory that is shared is not, it's an advantage as opposed to
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.120]  being the cheaping out in the back Intel days
[19:03.120 --> 19:07.280]  with integrated graphics, that when you're doing these things that
[19:07.280 --> 19:10.560]  are video intensive, being able to share the same memory
[19:10.560 --> 19:17.200]  is just, you're just, the computer isn't doing the shuffling between cache
[19:17.200 --> 19:22.720]  and this memory and that memory that had to be done before, it's just there,
[19:22.720 --> 19:25.920]  it's all on a fast bus, everything that you'd want to be fast
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.240]  in production, not just artificial benchmarks, but in actual production
[19:30.240 --> 19:34.320]  doing real things that you really do, man, you're just not waiting for it,
[19:34.320 --> 19:40.720]  and now here we are, and we're already like, yeah, I can see how slow those were.
[19:40.720 --> 19:43.840]  Well, it's funny too, the RAM thing particularly, I think for long time,
[19:43.840 --> 19:47.280]  you know, computer users, Mac users, like you and me, like,
[19:47.280 --> 19:50.640]  our, the conventional wisdom for so long was like, you know, you buy as much RAM as
[19:50.640 --> 19:53.600]  you can afford, and I feel like this has thrown me for a
[19:53.600 --> 19:57.120]  bit of a loop in the modern era when I'm actually speccing out machines like,
[19:57.120 --> 20:00.160]  do I really need 32 gigs? I mean, the 16 gigs
[20:00.160 --> 20:03.680]  are pretty good, and with the unified memory architecture, it really
[20:03.680 --> 20:06.880]  doesn't feel like I'm running out of memory all the time or running into that
[20:06.880 --> 20:10.240]  as the ceiling, and I struggle with it because it is
[20:10.240 --> 20:14.000]  still expensive, right? You're spending a few hundred bucks to go up in RAM costs,
[20:14.000 --> 20:17.600]  and you're like, oh, is it worth it? I just, it has kind of
[20:17.600 --> 20:21.120]  thrown for a loop this, you know, my conventional wisdom for
[20:21.120 --> 20:24.480]  buying Macs, and, you know, I guess we shouldn't be
[20:24.480 --> 20:27.520]  surprised to see the year-over-year improvements. We've seen them, you know,
[20:27.520 --> 20:32.160]  with the iPad and the iPhone for the last decade-plus, like, you know,
[20:32.160 --> 20:35.360]  Apple just continually every year comes out with a chip that's just a little bit
[20:35.360 --> 20:38.320]  faster, and, you know, it seems like the Mac is kind of on
[20:38.320 --> 20:42.000]  the same trajectory, like, yep, that M1, you know, the M1 from
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.800]  Intel is a huge jump, right? That's night and day, but, you know,
[20:46.800 --> 20:49.840]  little incremental improvements year over year, and
[20:49.840 --> 20:54.080]  all the other stuff they've added in, right, the improved memory bandwidth,
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.200]  a big neural engine, you know, graphics cores
[20:57.200 --> 21:02.080]  out the wazoo, basically, like, all that stuff has has added up,
[21:02.080 --> 21:05.200]  and so, yeah, I mean, it is kind of wild that, you know, a
[21:05.200 --> 21:08.800]  couple years later it was in the, yeah, the M1's old hat.
[21:08.800 --> 21:14.080]  It's time for the M2. I think, you know, it's very safe to say, and I know
[21:14.080 --> 21:18.560]  some people, I'm not going to name names, but there are
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.800]  reviewers and commentators out there who always
[21:22.800 --> 21:26.800]  poo-poo speed bumps, because they're not exciting, right? There's some people who
[21:26.800 --> 21:31.440]  whose brains are wired up to only get excited
[21:31.440 --> 21:38.160]  with the dopamine hit that comes from an altogether new design, but I think
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.040]  speed, I've always thought that speed bumps are
[21:41.040 --> 21:44.320]  great, because they're, or at least they are
[21:44.320 --> 21:48.400]  when you're, you've got a hardware foundation that you're happy with, and
[21:48.400 --> 21:53.120]  I think, you know, what it's, for what it is, the Mac Mini,
[21:53.120 --> 21:56.800]  there's pretty simple hardware to describe. It's, you know, small footprint,
[21:56.800 --> 22:00.080]  small height, and, you know, fewer or more ports,
[22:00.080 --> 22:03.920]  depending on how much you pay. I think the 14 and 16 inch MacBook
[22:03.920 --> 22:08.960]  Pros are fantastic. I bought last year the, or the end of, very
[22:08.960 --> 22:15.360]  end of the year before, whenever, the 14 inch M1
[22:15.360 --> 22:22.480]  MacBook Pro, and I, same as you, I did. My pet thing is, yes, buy as much
[22:22.480 --> 22:27.440]  RAM as I need, and my main RAM need is my terrible, terrible
[22:27.440 --> 22:33.600]  Safari tab hoarding problem, where I literally have, and I know this bothers
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.840]  some people who are habitual tab tidiers,
[22:37.840 --> 22:42.880]  literally hundreds of open Safari tabs at a time, and Safari deals with that
[22:42.880 --> 22:47.200]  far better, in my experience, than any Chrome-based browser,
[22:47.200 --> 22:50.560]  not to get into a Safari versus Chrome argument, but Safari does a very good
[22:50.560 --> 22:56.640]  job of keeping background tabs from running amuck CPU-wise, but
[22:56.640 --> 23:02.400]  the RAM adds up, and I do hunt for those tabs. I keep them
[23:02.400 --> 23:08.160]  open for a reason, and it's like, with the old days, when I was swapping,
[23:08.160 --> 23:11.920]  because I'd run out of real memory because of all my tabs, and I'd go to a
[23:11.920 --> 23:15.520]  tab that had been swapped out, then you'd get the beach ball for a
[23:15.520 --> 23:18.960]  second, or, you know, or even if the beach ball didn't appear, it just took a while
[23:18.960 --> 23:23.440]  for that tab to come forward, whereas now it's just instantaneous. I did buy mine
[23:23.440 --> 23:28.240]  with the full, last year's maximum, 64 gigs of RAM.
[23:28.240 --> 23:31.920]  I have checked every so often. I was going to say, have they made enough RAM
[23:31.920 --> 23:37.520]  for that many Safari tabs? No, they have, and I've also noticed, and I will say
[23:37.520 --> 23:41.120]  this as a, you know, as a compliment, as somebody
[23:41.120 --> 23:45.520]  who's known, you know, and openly criticizes
[23:45.520 --> 23:50.160]  the reliability of Apple's software on a regular basis, that
[23:50.160 --> 23:57.840]  with macOS, the later versions of macOS 12,
[23:57.840 --> 24:02.400]  and all of that, I switched to Ventura on my real Mac, the one I work on,
[24:02.400 --> 24:07.360]  when 13.1 came out. I kind of think I could have gone with 13.0, and I
[24:07.360 --> 24:11.040]  wouldn't have been unhappy. It's just that I'm a little conservative,
[24:11.040 --> 24:14.480]  just because you can't go backwards easily,
[24:14.480 --> 24:18.000]  and I just, it literally depends on it. But I,
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.680]  just a couple, I don't know, a week or two ago, or probably
[24:21.680 --> 24:25.040]  about a week ago, I checked, and my uptime was like
[24:25.040 --> 24:28.880]  29 days. I hadn't restarted my Mac in 29 days.
[24:28.880 --> 24:35.120]  Didn't notice, went to activity monitor, and still swap. Was it zero? Like, it still
[24:35.120 --> 24:38.640]  hadn't swapped any memory at all, with hundreds of tabs
[24:38.640 --> 24:42.320]  open for 29 days. So 64 is obvious. That's pretty
[24:42.320 --> 24:44.720]  impressive. Well, and the other thing that's really nice
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.440]  about that is, it's the, you know, out of RAM,
[24:49.440 --> 24:53.440]  CPU, and GPU, RAM's the one where I know that I can use it.
[24:53.440 --> 24:56.880]  So now that this year's new models go up to 96,
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.400]  I have no temptation, because I couldn't, if I couldn't
[25:00.400 --> 25:06.880]  swap at all in a month with 64, I guess 64 is enough for me.
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.960]  So yeah, that's good logic. I don't think, I guess the other thing
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.520]  that I always, I try to concentrate in reviews, I know you do too,
[25:15.520 --> 25:22.160]  is knowing that most, almost every product that Apple makes is
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.880]  not really intended for the owners of the previous generation one
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.680]  to immediately upgrade to. And that's part of the thing where their products
[25:31.680 --> 25:34.640]  are not super low priced. They're, you know, widely
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.080]  regarded as premium priced, but when you buy
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.280]  a $400 Apple Watch, you're supposed to get
[25:41.280 --> 25:44.400]  several years of life out of it. It's a $400
[25:44.400 --> 25:48.880]  watch. Most people, most Apple Watch users have never bought a watch,
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.560]  probably even half the price of their Apple Watch. It's
[25:52.560 --> 25:55.680]  expensive for a watch by most people's standards,
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.040]  so it should last years and years. You're not supposed to compare
[25:59.040 --> 26:03.600]  the Series 7 to the Series 8, other than just showing what is,
[26:03.600 --> 26:06.800]  you know, it's interesting to see what the year-over-year improvements are, but
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.640]  that's not really the buying guide part. The buying guide is more for people who
[26:10.640 --> 26:16.160]  own like a Series 4 or Series 5, right? MacBook Pro, if you bought a
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.880]  four or five thousand dollar M1 MacBook Pro with lots of RAM and
[26:20.880 --> 26:25.360]  maybe the extra SSD and whatever else, you're supposed to get
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.000]  more than a year or 18 months out of it, for sure.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.000]  Like, I love getting a Mac set up just the way I like it and then using it for
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.320]  years and not having to worry about upgrading
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.480]  this or that. So, you know, are M1 MacBook Pro users
[26:40.480 --> 26:43.360]  going to want to upgrade to this? Almost certainly not,
[26:43.360 --> 26:50.080]  unless you know you do. Unless you know that a 30% difference in GPU is going to
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.240]  save you noticeable time because you're doing
[26:54.240 --> 26:57.920]  8K video exports on a regular basis that peg
[26:57.920 --> 27:01.600]  all of the GPUs, or as best that the software you're using can,
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.600]  and a 30% improvement would be noticeable.
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.080]  Yeah, I mean, and I think I was in some ways really well situated for dealing
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.640]  with the the mini in particularly because I was,
[27:12.640 --> 27:19.280]  I had a 5K iMac, an Intel 2017 model that basically went belly up
[27:19.280 --> 27:23.520]  over last summer, and so I was left with just my air, which is the reason it was
[27:23.520 --> 27:26.400]  sort of my only computer for a while there, and so I'd been in the market
[27:26.400 --> 27:29.520]  already. I was like, well, I know, you know, I've got my Intel iMac. I'm
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.400]  gonna replace this with Apple Silicon, obviously, like, because it's only a
[27:32.400 --> 27:36.000]  matter of time, and I found myself thinking, well, the
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.160]  all the Apple authors in the iMac department
[27:38.160 --> 27:42.720]  is an M1, and they're not seemingly making a larger version
[27:42.720 --> 27:46.640]  anytime soon, so it seems like the Mac Mini or Mac
[27:46.640 --> 27:51.280]  Studio is something that I am, you know, really well situated to
[27:51.280 --> 27:54.800]  review because that's probably what I'm going to end up replacing with, and so
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.520]  comparing the M2 Pro Mac Mini with stuff that I was doing
[27:59.520 --> 28:03.280]  on my iMac, like you said, you get that multi-year benefit. Not only is it, like,
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.040]  five, six years newer, but it's also got the transition
[28:07.040 --> 28:10.880]  from Intel to Apple Silicon. If you're coming from an Intel
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.720]  computer to the Apple Silicon, it is, it is just bananas. Like,
[28:14.720 --> 28:18.160]  the biggest test that kind of blew me away on the M2 Pro Mini was
[28:18.160 --> 28:21.840]  I did some video streaming stuff, not a lot, but I used, like, OBS, and I've used
[28:21.840 --> 28:24.800]  Ecamm Live to do some video streaming for our, uh,
[28:24.800 --> 28:28.160]  we do an actual Play D&D podcast over at The Incomparable,
[28:28.160 --> 28:31.760]  and I handle a lot of the streaming on that, and running that on my Intel iMac
[28:31.760 --> 28:38.640]  was painful. It, OBS was not well, uh, you know, customer, like, it wasn't
[28:38.640 --> 28:42.320]  really taking advantage of all the Apple frameworks that were
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.160]  available. I don't think the hardware, like, encoding a video or anything ever
[28:46.160 --> 28:50.320]  really worked. Um, they were actually using the wrong
[28:50.320 --> 28:54.160]  framework for display capture stuff. Apple had to check in a code fix for
[28:54.160 --> 28:57.040]  them, which is my favorite bit. They went, like,
[28:57.040 --> 28:59.360]  you know, like, get up, and they're like, yeah, guys, you're not supposed to be
[28:59.360 --> 29:01.760]  using this. That's why your frame rates suck.
[29:01.760 --> 29:06.480]  Um, so I finally, I switched to Ecamm Live because, you know, those guys, they know
[29:06.480 --> 29:09.200]  what they're doing. They're Mac guys, right? Like, everything is optimized. Ran on
[29:09.200 --> 29:12.640]  Apple Silicon Native, all that, uh, and I was pretty happy with that, but
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.960]  for this test, I downloaded OBS to do some light streaming just to test it out,
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.600]  and I went through and, like, set it all up, and I'm, you know, running,
[29:21.600 --> 29:26.320]  streaming, like, uh, playing, like, a game for my PS5 via the app on my Mac,
[29:26.320 --> 29:30.160]  and I'm streaming that, and I'm streaming continuity camera from my iPhone,
[29:30.160 --> 29:33.520]  and the CPU meter down at the bottom is at
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.560]  5%, and I'm like, what the hell? This would heal my iMac. It would just
[29:40.560 --> 29:43.200]  leave it chugging along, and I would have terrible
[29:43.200 --> 29:46.720]  performance, and this was incredibly smooth, and you got the feeling
[29:46.720 --> 29:50.800]  that Apple really spent some time, like, you know, game streaming is kind of a
[29:50.800 --> 29:53.840]  niche audience, but it's something that shows off performance well, and I think
[29:53.840 --> 29:56.880]  Apple spent the time to try and make sure that something like OBS, which is
[29:56.880 --> 29:59.360]  one of the sort of standards in the industry,
[29:59.360 --> 30:03.840]  works well on Apple Silicon, and it does. I mean, it still looks
[30:03.840 --> 30:06.960]  kind of crappy because it's an open source app that's cross-platform,
[30:06.960 --> 30:12.960]  but it performs really nicely on a M2 Pro, so that, that to me was kind of the
[30:12.960 --> 30:15.680]  moment that I was like, all right, this can handle pretty much
[30:15.680 --> 30:21.440]  anything I can throw at it. You pointed out in your review, what I
[30:21.440 --> 30:25.840]  alluded to earlier, that they still have not brought back Space Gray.
[30:25.840 --> 30:30.560]  You can get, as you said, you can get your Mac Mini in a wide range of specs,
[30:30.560 --> 30:35.360]  but you can get it in and any color you want, so long as the color is silver.
[30:35.360 --> 30:39.520]  I find that a little disappointing, especially since
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.880]  they have so few colors in the Mac lineup
[30:42.880 --> 30:47.280]  already, you know, and everybody, you know, Midnight was exciting. Midnight is the
[30:47.280 --> 30:49.840]  most, the Midnight MacBook Air is the most
[30:49.840 --> 30:53.680]  exciting new Mac color in a long time, and that's not saying much, because
[30:53.680 --> 30:58.880]  that's a pretty, pretty close to dark gray blue,
[30:58.880 --> 31:03.920]  the Midnight. Yeah, but the iMac, why the iMac has great colors.
[31:03.920 --> 31:08.560]  The iMac has great colors, right. I'll just say that's great colors, and
[31:08.560 --> 31:11.920]  there's a lot of people who would like to see that spread throughout
[31:11.920 --> 31:18.320]  more Macs, you know, is the Mac Mini going to get iMac style
[31:18.320 --> 31:22.080]  colors? Why not? I don't know, but at the very least though,
[31:22.080 --> 31:25.360]  going, it not only didn't get any fun colors, like,
[31:25.360 --> 31:31.680]  you know, red, yellow, green type pink colors, it actually lost Space Gray,
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.480]  like, which is really pretty sad. I don't know.
[31:36.480 --> 31:40.480]  Yeah, I mean, that was one of my my few dings, I think, on them. The other
[31:40.480 --> 31:44.000]  one being the Mac Studio showed that Apple was
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.120]  willing to sort of mar the design of their
[31:47.120 --> 31:50.000]  beautiful hardware by putting ports on the front, which I think
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.280]  everybody was a big fan of, and it disappoints me
[31:53.280 --> 31:56.800]  that the Mac Mini did not follow in that. I could have used just one,
[31:56.800 --> 31:59.840]  you know, Thunderbolt or even a USB-C port on the front, like,
[31:59.840 --> 32:03.680]  I was testing out that feature they rolled out, where the security keys,
[32:03.680 --> 32:07.520]  hardware security keys for your Apple ID, and I'm like, I've got one of these
[32:07.520 --> 32:11.680]  Yubico keys, and I'm like, I gotta go behind the computer to, like,
[32:11.680 --> 32:14.800]  plug this in? This is super annoying, like, I don't
[32:14.800 --> 32:18.480]  understand why you aren't willing to put, even on just the M2 Pro version, like,
[32:18.480 --> 32:23.120]  stick a port on the front there. It kind of, that drives me a little nuts.
[32:23.120 --> 32:27.760]  Yeah, especially since, like you said, the Studio,
[32:27.760 --> 32:34.160]  you don't have to even be a Mac user, let alone a sort of Mac pundit
[32:34.160 --> 32:38.560]  reviewer to look at the two and say, oh, that's like the big
[32:38.560 --> 32:42.240]  brother and that's the little brother, you know, that's, this is the big version,
[32:42.240 --> 32:47.760]  big tall version of the Mini. They're obviously
[32:47.760 --> 32:51.360]  from the same company at a, you know, instantaneous, you could, you know, they,
[32:51.360 --> 32:55.120]  they're, they're siblings, and so that sort of,
[32:55.120 --> 32:58.640]  yeah, okay, for years we've avoided putting ports on the front,
[32:58.640 --> 33:01.920]  you know, and the argument against ports on the front is,
[33:01.920 --> 33:05.280]  I can't see how it's anything other than aesthetic.
[33:05.280 --> 33:09.520]  The people who buy a Mac Mini, it's not really a showcase device,
[33:09.520 --> 33:12.960]  and it's so practical to have easy access
[33:12.960 --> 33:17.120]  to the front case, you know, for plugging in, and then, you know, that's the whole
[33:17.120 --> 33:20.080]  point of anything. It's the whole point of
[33:20.080 --> 33:23.440]  Thunderbolt in these ports, is that you can,
[33:23.440 --> 33:30.800]  you can have a literally mini form factor and expand it, and you can
[33:30.800 --> 33:35.520]  have additional SSD storage, or if you want to go even bigger, you
[33:35.520 --> 33:39.120]  know, some kind of, still use the spinning hard disk to get,
[33:39.120 --> 33:42.800]  you know, enormous capacity.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.920]  Cameras, right, plugging in a camera or plugging
[33:45.920 --> 33:49.840]  a card reader in so you can read photos from a camera,
[33:49.840 --> 33:53.040]  and it's like, there's a lot of people who shoot photos with
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.080]  cameras that use cards and they need to connect it,
[33:56.080 --> 34:01.440]  and it's not like, oh, one time I got a new keyboard after three years, I need to
[34:01.440 --> 34:06.480]  reach around the back and plug it in. It's something they do every day, so.
[34:06.480 --> 34:09.760]  Yeah, right, and the aesthetics thing doesn't even hold up then, because like,
[34:09.760 --> 34:12.640]  if you're sticking a card reader on it, it's like, I've already marred your
[34:12.640 --> 34:15.600]  perfect setup by having a card reader hanging off of it,
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.280]  so you might as well at least let me do it easily. I don't know,
[34:19.280 --> 34:22.400]  it strikes me as strange. I understand, like, they've got the whole, you know,
[34:22.400 --> 34:25.120]  machine tooling process down, and they don't,
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.040]  you know, stick in a couple more holes in the case or wiring those ports at the
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.040]  front. I'm sure it's an added cost, but, you know, if you're going to at
[34:33.040 --> 34:35.680]  least offer ones that have, you know, four
[34:35.680 --> 34:38.080]  Thunderbolt ports instead of just two or whatever,
[34:38.080 --> 34:41.360]  it feels like it wouldn't be a huge stretch to
[34:41.360 --> 34:45.440]  at least offer something that's a little more accessible, but I guess they are,
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.120]  they are committed to that being a pro level lecture. If you want parts in the
[34:49.120 --> 34:54.480]  front, that's two thousand dollars. Yeah, whether you need that performance
[34:54.480 --> 34:56.800]  or not, or whether it's in your budget or not, it's,
[34:56.800 --> 35:00.240]  you know, and so there's a lot of people who, if the Mini really suits their
[35:00.240 --> 35:03.840]  needs, they'll just put up with reaching around the back every single
[35:03.840 --> 35:08.320]  time they need to get the card or whatever.
[35:08.320 --> 35:13.920]  I do think from Apple's messaging, and this is where we get into
[35:13.920 --> 35:18.560]  the Kremlinology part of it,
[35:18.560 --> 35:24.000]  seems to me, you know, one of going from the old Intel era to this era,
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.120]  obviously we're still waiting to hear the Mac Pro story,
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.400]  right, and, you know, we know it's coming because they went out of their way and
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.000]  in a very unusual edit, yeah, John Ternus finished the studio
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.880]  announcement last year with, we've got one more to go.
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.960]  Something I think obviously went wrong from their original
[35:42.960 --> 35:46.960]  plan because they did say it would, the whole transition would only take two
[35:46.960 --> 35:49.200]  years, and it's obviously going to take three
[35:49.200 --> 35:51.440]  years.
[35:51.440 --> 35:56.880]  And I guess, and, you know, without delving into rumors of what the Mac Pro
[35:56.880 --> 36:00.560]  is going to be too much, it's, you know, I think more or less
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.720]  it just skipped the M1 generation. It would be shocking if it came out with an
[36:04.720 --> 36:10.320]  M1 Ultra or M1 Extreme, then that's the Mac Pro at this point, you know, almost,
[36:10.320 --> 36:15.040]  you know, it just skipped the M1. I guess it's going to come out with an M2
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.640]  something, I don't know what they're going to call the chip,
[36:18.640 --> 36:24.880]  but the other computer from the Intel era that
[36:24.880 --> 36:30.240]  people, so the people who love it, love it, is the 27-inch iMac
[36:30.240 --> 36:36.080]  and didn't make it. They, you know, they call the 24-inch M1
[36:36.080 --> 36:40.160]  iMacs just the iMacs. There's no other name to them. I mean,
[36:40.160 --> 36:43.280]  obviously they could come, they could come out with a 27-inch model and it
[36:43.280 --> 36:48.160]  would be like the MacBook Pros. You'd get the iMac in two sizes, 24 or 27.
[36:48.160 --> 36:51.520]  I would be surprised if they do that. I mean, it wouldn't be shocking. I know it
[36:51.520 --> 36:56.720]  would make some people happy, but reading between the lines of Apple's
[36:56.720 --> 37:01.360]  marketing material and the briefings that we were offered
[37:01.360 --> 37:05.120]  as reviewers, you know, which are off the record, I
[37:05.120 --> 37:10.160]  can't quote them, but reading between the lines of what
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.120]  they said, it seems like they're steering people to think of a Mac
[37:15.120 --> 37:21.360]  Mini connected to a Mac Studio display as the new
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.720]  lot, you know, larger than the iMac, 24 inches,
[37:24.720 --> 37:32.000]  5K display. That's the answer. And honestly, I know there are people who
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.720]  love those iMacs. I owned and used the heck out of a 2014
[37:36.720 --> 37:40.480]  5K iMac and it was, I loved it. It was just one, you know,
[37:40.480 --> 37:43.440]  probably my favorite into, definitely my favorite Intel era
[37:43.440 --> 37:50.400]  desktop, but I actually like this better because I still feel bad about the
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.200]  fact that my 2014
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.440]  iMac is just sitting in a box now because the display
[37:59.440 --> 38:03.280]  is still fantastic. It is absolutely, you know, I don't want to use a
[38:03.280 --> 38:07.760]  2014 Intel computer at all, but the display is
[38:07.760 --> 38:11.120]  fantastic. I'd still have bought the Mac Studio
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.400]  last year display because I wanted the nano
[38:14.400 --> 38:18.560]  texture and I, but it's a real weird shame that I
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.360]  wasn't able to use my 5K gorgeous display
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.400]  just as a display. I'm looking, I'm looking at my 27 inch from 2017. It's on
[38:28.400 --> 38:30.800]  the floor in my office because I haven't figured out what to
[38:30.800 --> 38:32.720]  do with it, but I have the same feeling because it's like,
[38:32.720 --> 38:36.800]  for a while there, we had that hit of the target display mode where you could use
[38:36.800 --> 38:40.880]  an iMac as a display. It was a very small window where they let you do that
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.400]  and it does feel like a shame because I'm sitting here thinking like, I mean, the
[38:44.400 --> 38:48.320]  panel is basically the same in the studio display as in this iMac.
[38:48.320 --> 38:50.560]  Like, I went out and spent a lot of money and,
[38:50.560 --> 38:54.320]  you know, had to buy another thing to duplicate that where it would have been
[38:54.320 --> 38:57.280]  nice if I could have just plugged this Mac Mini into that iMac and been done
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.040]  with it, but yeah, it's not, I guess that's just too expensive to do
[39:03.040 --> 39:08.000]  as a piece of technology. I mean, I don't know, it struck me as strange
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.440]  as well and, I mean, you could see even in the the press releases when they talked
[39:11.440 --> 39:15.600]  about the M2 Pro Mac Mini and the announcement press release they put out,
[39:15.600 --> 39:19.840]  they compared it to a 27 inch Intel iMac like as a performance thing.
[39:19.840 --> 39:23.280]  Like, clearly that's the, yeah, yeah, this is how we're positioning this.
[39:23.280 --> 39:28.080]  So, I can't argue with it and I agree. I like the idea that at least when I,
[39:28.080 --> 39:31.760]  you know, if I buy an M2 Pro Mac Mini and I use it for a few years,
[39:31.760 --> 39:35.280]  I can swap it out and keep the display. That's assuming they haven't made, you
[39:35.280 --> 39:38.800]  know, another fancy new display, but I'm sure this one will keep working for the
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.560]  interim. So, I'm invested now and it does raise the price too, right, like
[39:42.560 --> 39:45.600]  buying a Mac Mini and an Apple Studio display.
[39:45.600 --> 39:48.400]  If you're buying an M2 Pro and a Mac Mini, so you're talking a couple
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.040]  thousand dollars, twenty five hundred dollars, which is, I guess, around the
[39:51.040 --> 39:55.120]  price you paid for a 27 inch iMac, but it, you know, hopefully the investment pays
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.480]  out a little bit longer and you can keep these hardware sort of rotating
[39:58.480 --> 40:02.480]  through. Yeah, but I don't think it's any exaggeration. I know it's, in our racket
[40:02.480 --> 40:05.840]  it's pretty hard to say blank is going to still be useful in 10 years, but I
[40:05.840 --> 40:09.840]  think a Mac Studio display you buy now is very likely to be a very good
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.120]  credible display 10 years from now. And so, who knows how many Mac Minis you
[40:15.120 --> 40:20.400]  might upgrade between now and then and you're saving, you know,
[40:20.400 --> 40:23.520]  tremendous amount of money by just plugging it back into the Mac Studio
[40:23.520 --> 40:27.920]  display you already own. And it's not just, it is
[40:27.920 --> 40:32.800]  environmentally sound, right? Not to be making all these displays that you,
[40:32.800 --> 40:36.480]  you know, just put in your basement like mine or put on your office floor like
[40:36.480 --> 40:41.200]  yours. But it's just more cost effective
[40:41.200 --> 40:46.080]  to think of the display as a modular part of your desktop. And I
[40:46.080 --> 40:49.040]  know, you know, people who really, really love the
[40:49.040 --> 40:54.000]  all-in-one don't want to hear it, but to me that's a better solution. I
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.120]  don't think they're ever going to come back with a bigger iMac again.
[40:57.120 --> 41:02.160]  I wonder, I guess rumors say there's going to be M2
[41:02.160 --> 41:06.080]  iMacs. I wonder, I don't know, I guess I've seen some rumors that say the iMac
[41:06.080 --> 41:10.320]  might wait till the M3. I wonder about the iMac period, whether
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.000]  or not it, you know, it has a future. Is all-in-one,
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.360]  does it really make sense for a desktop anymore? I'm not sure that it does.
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.640]  Well, I think there's still a niche there, right? Because, I mean,
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.400]  and this is evidenced by the fact that the iMac, like the Mac Mini, was an M1
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.560]  only machine, right? There's never an M1 Pro
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.480]  variant, and it doesn't, we don't know whether there will be one in the future,
[41:32.480 --> 41:36.320]  but that really firmly put it in the consumer level camp, right? This is not,
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.000]  you can't even spec up an M1 iMac to be like, hey, I want to, I just want an M1
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.080]  iMac with some more juice. Like, nope, that's what you got. So I
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.120]  think that kind of will tell us to a certain degree if
[41:47.120 --> 41:50.640]  Apple decides, whenever does the next version of the iMac, to
[41:50.640 --> 41:54.240]  say, okay, we also offer an M1 Pro, or no, it's still, or a
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.880]  pro level chip, or whatever generation we're on, or it's still just the vanilla,
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.080]  you know, base level chip. I think that's a pretty good indication of where the
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.160]  future of that product might be. The other reading between the lines thing
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.760]  that I detected that I'm very intrigued by is, to me,
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.920]  and again, this is all gut feeling. I can't prove it. I don't, my notes from, I
[42:17.920 --> 42:23.760]  have all my notes from 15 years of briefings with Apple people, but my
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.480]  notes aren't proof of it. But it feels to me like Apple themselves
[42:28.480 --> 42:31.520]  represent, you know, product marketing folks in the Mac division are talking
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.640]  about games on the Mac more than ever, ever in my career.
[42:36.640 --> 42:40.960]  You'd have to predate my writing during Fireball and having press access to
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.720]  Apple. I don't, but maybe even going back
[42:44.720 --> 42:47.920]  forever that maybe they're talking about games
[42:47.920 --> 42:51.520]  and these are good for games. Since at least Steve Jobs
[42:51.520 --> 42:54.720]  came on stage to talk about Halo back, yeah, Macworld Expo,
[42:54.720 --> 43:00.960]  yeah, 2000 or whatever. You know, the gaming thing, you know, I've played
[43:00.960 --> 43:06.320]  a lot of games on the Mac and other various platforms. I've built gaming PCs.
[43:06.320 --> 43:08.560]  I have a, I think I have every major console
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.160]  currently. So I, you know, I've played a lot of games
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.720]  and the gaming on the Mac problem has always been this, this tough,
[43:16.720 --> 43:20.560]  weird nut to crack. I think the fundamental issue for me is that Apple
[43:20.560 --> 43:25.200]  does not, as much as they talk up gaming, they don't really get it. When Steve
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.040]  Jobs would talk about the iPod and he would talk about music, you
[43:29.040 --> 43:32.400]  could tell that Steve felt personally passionate about music,
[43:32.400 --> 43:36.400]  right? He was into music. That was a product that, like, I think
[43:36.400 --> 43:39.120]  really resonated with something in the soul
[43:39.120 --> 43:42.320]  of Apple and of the way that he saw the business going.
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.120]  Then you could tell, like, when he would talk about, like, buying TV shows or
[43:45.120 --> 43:48.160]  renting movies, he's like, yeah, it's fine. He doesn't, he doesn't really care. It's
[43:48.160 --> 43:50.320]  like a, it's like a box to check. And I think
[43:50.320 --> 43:54.000]  gaming is a thing that, despite the fact that, you know, there are so many gamers
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.440]  out there and everybody of a certain age now, including, I
[43:57.440 --> 44:00.880]  assume, majority of people who work in Apple in many of the roles, at least
[44:00.880 --> 44:04.720]  below the C-level, are gamers or have played games in
[44:04.720 --> 44:07.840]  their lifetime. But you never got the sense from a cultural standpoint that
[44:07.840 --> 44:12.240]  they really got it. Like, yeah,
[44:12.240 --> 44:15.520]  I think there's always a little degree of snobbery around it, like,
[44:15.520 --> 44:19.520]  only in games. That's fine if you want to. And it's not because these machines are
[44:19.520 --> 44:22.960]  not very capable gaming machines. If the
[44:22.960 --> 44:26.080]  developers spend the time working with the tools that Apple
[44:26.080 --> 44:28.720]  provides, and, you know, they showed off a few games
[44:28.720 --> 44:31.680]  during their keynote, little keynote video,
[44:31.680 --> 44:35.600]  they run really well. I ran the Resident Evil Village,
[44:35.600 --> 44:38.720]  which has been really optimized to work with Metal and all that,
[44:38.720 --> 44:43.520]  and it looks great, honestly. Like, I put it up against a console, no problem.
[44:43.520 --> 44:47.280]  But the issue is that there aren't that many, like, that's one title
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.200]  among hundreds, right? If not more. And it's just that most game
[44:53.200 --> 44:56.960]  developers are not spending the time investing in the tools that Apple is
[44:56.960 --> 45:00.400]  offering. They want to build stuff that works on the PCs and
[45:00.400 --> 45:03.760]  works on consoles. And if you were a gamer, even if you were
[45:03.760 --> 45:07.200]  a diehard, you know, Mac user and a gamer for the last 20
[45:07.200 --> 45:10.240]  years, at a certain point you probably gave up,
[45:10.240 --> 45:13.040]  right? It was just like, it's just too much. It's too much trouble. Like, there's
[45:13.040 --> 45:15.920]  not enough stuff, and I can't get it. You probably went to a console or maybe
[45:15.920 --> 45:18.400]  built a gaming PC, and I think then you end up with this
[45:18.400 --> 45:20.640]  chicken and egg problem, which is like, there's not enough games,
[45:20.640 --> 45:23.520]  right? Because there's not enough demand, but there's not enough demand because
[45:23.520 --> 45:26.640]  everybody left the platform. So it's tough, and I think Apple wants to get out
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.000]  of it, but it's a really hard nut to crack. Yeah, it's a real, it really is a
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.880]  chicken and egg problem. Let's see, there's the Resident Evil,
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.040]  what's it called? Resident Evil Blank Village, and the other one there,
[45:37.040 --> 45:41.440]  which was written by Antony Johnston, who you may know, who's a frequent
[45:41.440 --> 45:44.480]  incomparable panelist, he did the, he wrote the script for that one.
[45:44.480 --> 45:49.360]  Huh, I did not know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he won some awards for it too, I
[45:49.360 --> 45:52.160]  think, so. I started playing it, I only got through,
[45:52.160 --> 45:54.720]  I don't do horror games, really, I only got through, like,
[45:54.720 --> 45:58.000]  oh, I hate it, you made me go into it, like, I,
[45:58.000 --> 46:01.760]  I had to go, like, a creepy cabin. I didn't even see a zombie, John, I went to a creepy
[46:01.760 --> 46:05.760]  cabin. I was like, I'm done. I used to play a lot more games, never
[46:05.760 --> 46:08.880]  liked horror games for that reason. I do watch horror movies, I've said this
[46:08.880 --> 46:12.640]  before, my family and I, we, we, my wife and son like them much more than I
[46:12.640 --> 46:16.400]  do. I'm, I'm, I'm not embarrassed to admit, I, I, I get,
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.240]  I get really creeped out, and I, I could, I don't like watching them by
[46:20.240 --> 46:23.680]  myself for sure, I wouldn't do it, and, but that's what playing a video game is
[46:23.680 --> 46:26.560]  like, right? You don't play a video game with your family. It's immersive, dude.
[46:26.560 --> 46:30.640]  But it's like, I need, I need my son and my wife next to me on the couch so I can,
[46:30.640 --> 46:35.120]  like, grab, I need, I need somebody to, to squeeze a hand or something, you know,
[46:35.120 --> 46:38.000]  uh, I really do. Played in daylight too, let me tell you,
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.720]  otherwise. What's the other one that they're talking up, I think it's No Man's
[46:40.720 --> 46:43.520]  Sky? No Man's Sky, but here's the thing with
[46:43.520 --> 46:45.440]  No Man's Sky, and I've played that game on my,
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.640]  I want to say on my Xbox, like, it's, it's not
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.880]  new, it's several years old at this point, and it's, it's a game that iterated, like,
[46:52.880 --> 46:55.600]  they've, they've come out with updates to it and stuff like that,
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.000]  and it's still a very demanding game, but it's also, I want to say it's like 2006,
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.880]  yeah, maybe, maybe a little later, but it's not
[47:02.880 --> 47:07.600]  new. Right, it's demanding, it's open world, I mean, literally open worlds,
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.120]  right, the whole idea is it's like a galaxy full of planets, and they're,
[47:11.120 --> 47:16.560]  each planet is different, and, um, the demos I saw of it, it looks
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.280]  visually impressive on the Apple Silicon, but No Man's Sky
[47:21.280 --> 47:25.200]  is all, my understanding, this is very much informed by my son, who's, you
[47:25.200 --> 47:30.000]  know, very much a real gamer, um, that No Man's Sky is a very odd game,
[47:30.000 --> 47:33.920]  it's just sort of on its own in the industry, it's not like a
[47:33.920 --> 47:37.440]  typical AAA title, it's sort of, they're, they've been marching to the
[47:37.440 --> 47:42.560]  beat of their own drummer forever, had sort of a rocky launch, you
[47:42.560 --> 47:44.800]  know, it's, like many games, took longer to launch
[47:44.800 --> 47:49.600]  than they wanted to, launched in a sort of incomplete shape,
[47:49.600 --> 47:53.360]  and maybe left a poor first impression because of that,
[47:53.360 --> 47:56.960]  but kept, have spent, you know, non-stop for those
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.200]  five or six years, you know, iterating and improving on it,
[48:01.200 --> 48:04.640]  but they're out on their own, and so it's not surprising to me that
[48:04.640 --> 48:09.040]  because they're different than the typical PC
[48:09.040 --> 48:12.640]  and console AAA titles, that they've also got
[48:12.640 --> 48:19.440]  a source code base and backend engine that is amenable to this,
[48:19.440 --> 48:23.760]  whereas the, the problem with so many AAA titles,
[48:23.760 --> 48:28.480]  the chicken and egg problem, is that these, like, Unity and, what's the other
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.400]  one, uh, the big game engine, Unreal, right, the
[48:32.400 --> 48:37.280]  Epic one, are just in, and yes, they have a story,
[48:37.280 --> 48:40.880]  there's a path, because they, you know, you can make these games and they run on
[48:40.880 --> 48:43.520]  iPhones, and because, yeah, because the iPhone is
[48:43.520 --> 48:48.080]  this huge market, so there's a path, but when it comes to desktop type
[48:48.080 --> 48:52.320]  hardware, the tooling is all, is all based on the
[48:52.320 --> 48:56.000]  Intel world, including, if not even more important
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.320]  than, certainly more important than CPU, I
[48:58.320 --> 49:03.840]  shouldn't even speculate, the GPU world of GPU, yeah, you know, Nvidia
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.600]  video cards, uh, which is a different world, and
[49:07.600 --> 49:14.000]  also, unfortunately for Apple, Apple Silicon has a much stronger
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.120]  lead, just
[49:17.360 --> 49:24.160]  objectively, by any measure, over the Intel and, uh,
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.800]  the whole x86 world CPU wise, than the Apple Silicon GPUs do,
[49:30.800 --> 49:33.840]  versus the state of the art from Nvidia, where,
[49:33.840 --> 49:40.480]  okay, Apple's, I think, clearly leads on performance per watt, but Nvidia
[49:40.480 --> 49:46.320]  clearly leads on performance, period, who cares how hot it is, get a liquid cooling
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.160]  system, and, you know, make, make your neighbor's
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.640]  lights blink when you're pegging all the GPU cores, um,
[49:54.640 --> 49:58.080]  Apple doesn't have an answer for that yet, and therefore,
[49:58.080 --> 50:01.760]  you know, and one of the things that pegs video cards are games,
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.280]  right, so if you're writing a game to squeeze out
[50:05.280 --> 50:08.720]  the best possible graphics at the highest
[50:08.720 --> 50:13.440]  possible frame rates, that there's a reason that your tooling
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.840]  was optimized for that world, and it doesn't, there is no way to just, oh, just
[50:17.840 --> 50:21.600]  flip a switch and spit out a version for Apple Silicon.
[50:21.600 --> 50:24.560]  Right, yeah, yeah, that's always been the challenge, right, back in the days of
[50:24.560 --> 50:27.360]  DirectX and stuff, when Microsoft had really sort of
[50:27.360 --> 50:30.960]  invested in, like, let's sort of build this out, this architecture, and make it,
[50:30.960 --> 50:34.400]  uh, interesting gaming, I mean, I think you're also, the point about, like,
[50:34.400 --> 50:38.000]  games being something that really challenges the GPU, I'd argue they're,
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.200]  they're the thing that, you know, most people is going to encounter, right, like,
[50:43.200 --> 50:47.760]  there are other uses that will, like, peg a GPU, but, like, for the average
[50:47.760 --> 50:53.280]  Mac user slash, you know, computer user, the amount of GPUs that's in the, in any
[50:53.280 --> 50:57.120]  Apple Silicon chip is overkill. Zillions more people are playing
[50:57.120 --> 51:01.440]  video games that, that, uh, press their desktop PC
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.080]  GPU compared to how many people whose video export needs
[51:06.080 --> 51:09.680]  are doing the same. It's, right, orders several,
[51:09.680 --> 51:13.200]  several, if not many, orders of magnitude difference,
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.960]  but it's interesting to me that Apple seems to care, and I don't think it's a
[51:16.960 --> 51:20.080]  passing fad, I've just, just, over the last couple
[51:20.080 --> 51:23.360]  years, I've just heard,
[51:23.680 --> 51:28.080]  just here and there, you know, and just sort of offhand, off the record remarks
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.360]  of people at Apple who've, you know, heard me talking on my
[51:31.360 --> 51:34.720]  podcast that I have a, had, or still have a teenager, I guess he
[51:34.720 --> 51:39.840]  still is a teenager, he's 19, uh, a teenage son in my family who
[51:39.840 --> 51:44.080]  still wanted a gaming PC, and, you know, and people at Apple who
[51:44.080 --> 51:47.760]  found that curious and wanted to know more about it, but I think that also
[51:47.760 --> 51:50.560]  speaks to what you said about that there's a lot of people at Apple who
[51:50.560 --> 51:52.960]  just are, that whole world is so foreign to them,
[51:52.960 --> 51:55.440]  whereas there's a lot of other people, I'm sure
[51:55.440 --> 51:58.880]  there's thousands and thousands of people listening to this episode of the
[51:58.880 --> 52:03.200]  show who are gaming enthusiasts who know, they don't
[52:03.200 --> 52:06.400]  need me to explain why my teenage son wanted a gaming PC.
[52:06.400 --> 52:09.520]  They're like, of course he did! Right, I mean, yeah, yeah,
[52:09.520 --> 52:13.840]  I mean, you look at, you look at the, you know, Apple executive bio page, and you
[52:13.840 --> 52:16.480]  try to figure out, okay, which one of these people is a gamer?
[52:16.480 --> 52:19.520]  It's not Tim Cook, it's not Jeff Williams, right? Like,
[52:19.520 --> 52:23.360]  the feeling, I don't know, maybe Schiller played some games in his day, probably,
[52:23.360 --> 52:26.560]  but I think probably not recently. You know, Schiller might be the one, because
[52:26.560 --> 52:30.480]  Schiller, wasn't there a story? Like, like racing games? Yeah, no, and that he,
[52:30.480 --> 52:33.600]  somehow it, I forget how this came out, it wasn't like a, but
[52:33.600 --> 52:40.320]  he's got, like, uh, some kind of, like, uh, like a Formula One simulator, like a
[52:40.320 --> 52:44.720]  dedicated setup, like, with a, like a, like a car seat and a car
[52:44.720 --> 52:48.160]  steering wheel, and like a wraparound display, you know,
[52:48.160 --> 52:53.200]  which has almost certainly got a PC under the hood somewhere. Right,
[52:53.200 --> 52:56.960]  right, yeah. So maybe he's the answer. Yeah, all right, yeah, I guess, I guess,
[52:56.960 --> 52:59.280]  like, you need, that's what you need, you need somebody in there who's going to
[52:59.280 --> 53:02.880]  take, like, as the evangelist for gaming. I'd love to see it, because the Mac,
[53:02.880 --> 53:07.120]  well, and the other thing, too, is I think, you know, Apple's been so successful in
[53:07.120 --> 53:10.160]  so many ways, but they're at their best, like anybody, when they're the,
[53:10.160 --> 53:13.520]  upstart, and they've got something to prove, and there's somebody who's clearly
[53:13.520 --> 53:19.600]  ahead of them, right? So, you know, an Apple that's focused on
[53:19.600 --> 53:23.120]  trying to make the Mac relevant to desktop gaming is an
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.560]  Apple I like, not just, not because I personally foresee myself, therefore,
[53:26.560 --> 53:30.240]  getting back into desktop gaming, but I just think it's good for Apple to see
[53:30.240 --> 53:34.480]  where it's behind and to try to, try to attack it. One last thing on
[53:34.480 --> 53:40.560]  these M2 Macs from this month is the,
[53:40.560 --> 53:46.560]  the wah-wah, sad trombone, sad news, is this thing about the slower SSDs
[53:46.560 --> 53:52.000]  compared to the preceding model at the same storage or price.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.040]  I forget which ones, it's like, at the lowest,
[53:55.040 --> 53:58.560]  you may be correct me with details if you know them off the top of your head,
[53:58.560 --> 54:01.920]  but basically, it's like, if you get, like, the 512
[54:01.920 --> 54:09.360]  gigabyte one, it used to be two 256 gigabyte SSDs on the board,
[54:09.360 --> 54:12.400]  you don't know, you know, you wouldn't know that, you never look at it, right, but
[54:12.400 --> 54:17.520]  that's how it's implemented, and now it's just one 512
[54:17.520 --> 54:23.680]  SSD, and you get performance advantages from having two
[54:23.680 --> 54:27.360]  of them that can work in parallel, and you could be
[54:27.360 --> 54:30.560]  reading from one while writing to the other, and
[54:30.560 --> 54:37.840]  basically, there are first disk-intensive tests, the new ones might be at the lower
[54:37.840 --> 54:41.040]  end slower than the old ones, and some people,
[54:41.040 --> 54:44.880]  I take this as a, well, that sucks, that's unfortunate, but I'm sure
[54:44.880 --> 54:48.000]  that Apple knew that, and I'm sure there's good reasons for the
[54:48.000 --> 54:53.360]  total cost of goods for the device, and it's only true for these lower-end
[54:53.360 --> 54:56.880]  storage models, and it sucks if you're on a budget and you
[54:56.880 --> 54:59.600]  want the disk speed, but your budget is capped,
[54:59.600 --> 55:03.200]  and now you've got to choose between, like, finding an
[55:03.200 --> 55:07.920]  old M1 one that's still available to buy somewhere
[55:07.920 --> 55:13.600]  to get slightly better SSD performance, or having to take a downgrade in SSD
[55:13.600 --> 55:15.600]  performance compared to the first generation
[55:15.600 --> 55:20.480]  of these Mac Minis, but it doesn't affect the people who are buying, like, the one
[55:20.480 --> 55:24.000]  terabyte and over ones, which I think are more typical for people who
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.840]  care at all about their SSD. Right, yeah, that's, I mean, that's the kind
[55:29.840 --> 55:32.560]  of the nut of this, I mean, there's a couple things happening here, one of
[55:32.560 --> 55:35.680]  which is, you know, I was listening to Jason Snell
[55:35.680 --> 55:41.200]  and Mike Hurley talking about this, and, you know, saying that if Apple had
[55:41.200 --> 55:44.000]  just said, this is fast SSD and this is a faster
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.280]  SSD, no, there would be no issue, right, like, they know,
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.720]  and, you know, it was going to come out because people are going to benchmark
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.480]  this. It didn't come out immediately because,
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.000]  as we mentioned earlier, the reviewers got the M2 Pros,
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.600]  but I don't think anybody got the M2 Pro with the base level sort of
[55:59.600 --> 56:03.840]  wrong, but I think most of us got ones that were kicked up a bit,
[56:03.840 --> 56:07.200]  and so, you know, obviously it's not going to show up until, like, people start
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.120]  getting them. Two, is it that big a deal? Like you
[56:11.120 --> 56:14.080]  said, it's really for disk intensive tests. I think the best analogy you could
[56:14.080 --> 56:17.520]  come up with is if you bought a car and, like, the advertiser said, this car
[56:17.520 --> 56:20.720]  would go 150 miles an hour, or top out on 50 miles an hour, and you
[56:20.720 --> 56:25.200]  got, it's like, it only goes to 120, which is, you know, a difference, right?
[56:25.200 --> 56:27.680]  You paid for it thinking it would go to that higher speed,
[56:27.680 --> 56:31.680]  but you're also not going to be driving even 120 miles per hour, much less 150
[56:31.680 --> 56:34.960]  miles per hour, unless you're doing, like, some serious specialized
[56:34.960 --> 56:39.280]  racing or something like that, so it both is something they should have
[56:39.280 --> 56:43.120]  disclosed and a real world performance. It's probably not going to matter for
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.040]  most people, but that is frustrating because it feels like an unforced error.
[56:47.040 --> 56:50.560]  Like, Apple, you mentioned this thing's got, you know, 200 megabits per
[56:50.560 --> 56:53.280]  second, I don't remember, the memory bandwidth, right? You're giving the
[56:53.280 --> 56:55.600]  feature and saying the, you know, the pros got twice as much
[56:55.600 --> 56:59.040]  as the vanilla M2. You could have just added a line in specs and then nobody
[56:59.040 --> 57:02.720]  would have cared. Yeah, and I think that's the thing that
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.600]  gets lost in the criticism. It sucks. It's a minor, like I said, a little
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.600]  sad trombone. Sorry, I'm sure Apple wishes it weren't so,
[57:11.600 --> 57:15.920]  but we're still talking about overall fast SSD performance
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.000]  anyway, that the slowest SSD Apple sells in any of these Apple Silicon Macs,
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.280]  Alfred is a very good IO for reading and writing,
[57:23.280 --> 57:29.040]  and at those price points, it's almost, it's going to be extraordinarily
[57:29.040 --> 57:31.440]  rare that anybody who owns one is going to notice,
[57:31.440 --> 57:35.520]  I think, so I don't think it's a big deal, but worth mentioning.
[57:35.520 --> 57:38.560]  All right, let me take a break here. Thank our first sponsor of the show. It is our

[59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.880]  to the talk show. Home pods. Home pod two. I got
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:09.680]  review units last week. The reviews dropped I believe as we list as this
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.960]  show will air this morning. The reviews are supposed to
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.320]  drop on Tuesday the 31st.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.080]  More interest. I have more to say about the weird two-year gap
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.760]  between the old one being discontinued and no longer being for sale than the
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.240]  new ones. The new ones are the home pods back
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.800]  you know. I don't know what else to say about it
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.560]  other than I'm delighted as a as a home pod fan and someone who's
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:44.720]  was terribly upset that they discontinued them.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.160]  To my ears they sound as good or better. I know that some people looked at the
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.120]  tech specs and I think the old ones had seven
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.440]  tweeters and the new ones only had five and the old ones had more microphones and
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.360]  the new ones have fewer. To me it's the sound quality is as good
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.120]  or better. I think counting tweeters as a measure of audio quality is
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.360]  a fool's errand. Really it's just ridiculous.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.280]  I think it's like it's like counting megapixels as you're
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.680]  yes exactly you know yeah and maybe even worse though right it's like at least
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.480]  with megapixels there's some technical argument there's like
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.320]  there's a chance right if you really are shooting a photo that you want to blow
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.920]  up to billboard size the megapixels might matter in some way
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.840]  but yeah I would say with the tweeter count you I
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:40.160]  think it's possible that a someone with audio file style
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.680]  hearing which I don't have or taste might decide
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.800]  I wouldn't be surprised when I read these reviews that some people
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.320]  say I mean who knows I would maybe they're gonna say it doesn't sound as
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.760]  good to me they sound as good and I have got several pairs of OG
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.040]  home pods here that I've played mine against
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.320]  seems to sound the same to me at the volumes that
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.760]  any reasonable volume I would use in my house
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:07.360]  um I wouldn't be surprised if people say they sound better
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:10.800]  you know that Apple's audio wizards their hardware
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.560]  speaker team has made it sound better um it seems to me this is something that
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.880]  is impossible to put your finger on could easily be the placebo effect
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.080]  it seems to me that Siri responsiveness is
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.520]  in fact better than on the OG home pods that it's you know some combination of
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.840]  upgrading to the s7 chip yeah
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.280]  yeah I'm not I'm not sure it could be worse right um
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.480]  I say as somebody with a stereo pair of original home pods in my office and I've
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:44.720]  got a home pod mini downstairs and I oh man the number of times I've asked
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.680]  these home pods to do something and they just completely misinterpret it I mean I
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.480]  don't think any nobody has ever I think really thrown
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.760]  shade on Apple for the sound quality of the home pod right like that was not the
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.360]  problem with gen 1 they always sounded great it was
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.040]  everything else right uh I think there's you know a couple
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.520]  little details are nicer um did you get it did you
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.240]  have them yet or no I don't even know no I do not know I will
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.320]  answer what was one of my top questions is what does midnight look like the pair
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:18.080]  that I got from Apple one was white one is midnight so I can
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.120]  see both which I'm glad I'd certainly never buy
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.240]  them this way to pair them but uh mix match yeah sure it is
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:32.720]  oh boy it is it does not look blue to me at all
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.240]  unless depending on the exact if it's in the exact
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.840]  right nice neutral light I can pick up a slight amount of blue
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.120]  but the ever so slight I mean it is a very
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.680]  dark gray side by side with the old one in space gray to me in most of the
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.240]  lighting and I carried it around my house like an idiot
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.240]  one in each hand you know like I'm carrying two
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.520]  pineapples around or something in most of the rooms of my house under
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.440]  most lighting it just looks darker than the old space gray from the first
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.120]  generation just looks like even closer to black
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.800]  which is great for me I don't want one with a bluish tint I think
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.720]  I think you want something like a speaker to be neutral to me it's very
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.960]  neutral the compare and contrast with Apple's
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.560]  use of you know they love midnight right now midnight's having its
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:32.240]  moment right yeah the the MacBook Air to me is
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.080]  has a noticeable blue tint
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.560]  on the other hand some of the Apple watch straps that they call midnight
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.680]  are very boy you really got to look to see the blue in them they're just sort
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:49.600]  of the new black the HomePod is like that it is close to
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.760]  black the plug the power plug now comes out
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.280]  of the back oh thank you I don't know why I care
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.840]  but I do care I I don't know why it it was just just
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.440]  it was annoying to think your hope your your cable would die or like it free
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.360]  or something and you'd be like I gotta buy a whole new home uh
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.280]  otherwise it's a HomePod and it's back and so does it
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.640]  I'm just going by um you did share a picture I'm just going by
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.360]  the this so the screen is like it's it's it's mini style where it's slightly
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.880]  sunk yeah I think compared well the old one was like flush yeah whatever you
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.720]  want to call that thing on top the touch panel because it's not a screen
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.840]  is is right it's it is no more of a screen
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.600]  than the other one it just shows the same sort of fuzzy animation
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.640]  it is sunken now for some reason I don't know I don't know why
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.640]  you know it I don't think it really makes sense to try I don't think you can
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.320]  either pair an eight an old one old HomePod with a
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.120]  new one yeah no in fact now that I think about
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.240]  it Apple told us that in a press briefing
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.600]  yeah so to make a stereo pair it has to be
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.040]  two of the same models um I the sunken thing is slightly
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.160]  different uh the other thing they do now is the
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.440]  plus and minus indicators for volume are screen
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:14.640]  printed on the touch panel yeah the same as the mini and which is
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.680]  nice because it was always hard to find it on the original ones they would go
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.960]  away and you yeah or like when there's people in your
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.840]  house like guests who don't know how they work and they
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.800]  actually you know we keep ours near the paper towels
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:29.840]  or one of them in the kitchen and people would touch it with their palm and it
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.160]  would start playing music and they wouldn't know what to do
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.600]  I'm not quite sure that just starting it you know this will help that much but at
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.320]  least the plus and minus the permanent plus and minus will help people
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.680]  figure that part out right so even if if you're panicked and you've
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.960]  instantly started playing music you didn't want to you can at least tap tap
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.120]  tap on minus to make it quiet before you figure out what else to do
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:57.040]  uh the bottom is different if you turn an old original HomePod
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.080]  upside down there's a concavity on the bottom yeah the new ones just
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.160]  flat I who cares I guess you never really look at the bottom but it's it
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.320]  just shows me that it's a it's a complete redesign as similar as they
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.080]  look it's it's truly a new acoustical device sounds such a fascinating choice
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.120]  to redesign it and yet leave it so close to the right that they must
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.600]  like the way it looks I don't quite understand I don't know I
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.160]  guess so but like yeah I mean it I feel like you know having had the HomePods
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.920]  for a while like if you gave me an option like all right
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.440]  give me your top five things that we should fix
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.880]  I don't think any of them have been addressed in this and it's not that I
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.080]  think they're bad it's just like the things that I looked for
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:47.440]  in like oh this is great and if you were building on this you know
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.040]  I would like the screen to be a little more functional and you know
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.240]  it maybe bring the price a little bit down which they did do but I think that
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.000]  was the price when they discontinued it was already down to $2.99
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.440]  um and it's like lots of little things but they also are like all right we
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.240]  we've heard you we've revised the HomePod here it is and you're like
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:08.000]  this is is this the same thing you just pass off your homework and write the
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.040]  same essay again but yeah I don't know I guess they liked
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.160]  it yeah I wonder how it's going to do I don't know I I think in hindsight
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:21.280]  uh uh it and I wrote about this on Daring
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.720]  Fireball I even I got when they discontinued it I got caught up
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.880]  in the conventional wisdom that the damn thing was just too expensive
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.720]  and with all these competing smart speakers from
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.800]  Amazon and Google and whoever else that are you know 100 bucks
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.200]  or less it people just didn't want to spend $300 for it
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.280]  and I don't think that was the problem with it I know it didn't sell in great
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:49.200]  quantities apparently you know and presumably if it had they
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.200]  would have wouldn't have had this two-year gap in between
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:57.040]  but I do think though like why didn't they
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.760]  mac pro it right remember with the trash can mac pro where it just stayed in the
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.080]  lineup forever and they even had that weird well unusual
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.440]  briefing with me and panzerino and and a couple of other
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.720]  writers for the mac round table serious about the mac
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.120]  and and you know said look you know we painted ourselves in the thermal corner
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.160]  with this we you know didn't anticipate the rise of
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.320]  swappable gpus and we're we're going to address this
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.920]  we we we want to be in the pro market we're going to be in the pro market but
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.480]  for now you know this is it but they still kept
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.640]  selling the mac pro and like we were talking about with the mac mini before
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.840]  um apple keeps products in the lineup and they don't lower the price
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.960]  because they want to hold that spot right
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.200]  and you know the mac pro is a five thousand dollar computer so even when
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.760]  the 2013 trash can was years out of date and in terms of
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.160]  the latest and greatest from intel the price never went down because
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.920]  they wanted to hold that price so that when they did introduce the new
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.520]  mac pro it could start at that price and go up
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.040]  without seeming like a massive price increase
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.440]  from a thing that had been discounted compare and contrast with dell
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.960]  who like you you spec out a dell xps laptop today
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.960]  sleep on it go back tomorrow it might be 27 cheaper
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.440]  it might be 17 more expensive you know that based on component prices they'll
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.440]  just change the price tomorrow change it again the next day apple does
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.120]  the opposite they hold a price why not hold just keep selling the home
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.920]  pod until this new one was ready i can't help but i can't help but feel
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.320]  it that there was a fundamental flaw that led those original home pods to
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.440]  fail at a rate that was unacceptable to apple
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.040]  well except it's a little weird because of for a long time afterwards
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.080]  you could get them at like retailers for cheap right like they clearly and
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.640]  people were doing the thing where like you would look at the
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.520]  specs or whatever whatever you could pull up and like the manufacturer dates
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.720]  on them were like the lot numbers were like it's like the same lot
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.040]  and i think two things here's here's my theory like uh one i mean obviously and
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.120]  i think you mentioned this as well some other people
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.800]  the fact that the home pod mini always stuck around kind of implied the
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.240]  existence of a non-mini home pod and so the fact they
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.120]  were selling that while there was no larger home pod everyone was kind of
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.840]  like it seems like they're still right and i
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.040]  think honestly the home pod mini is the best
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.640]  argument for the home pod because you know people would buy oh
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.080]  nine nine dollars you know i'll take a flyer on that and give it a try
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:39.040]  and they're like oh man this is great but you know i'd like something where
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.640]  the sound was just a little bit better like in some ways it was a good
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.880]  way of getting people into the idea of using a smart speaker or having a
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.720]  wireless speaker in their house and then you could sort of turn around
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.760]  and be like well here's one with better even better sound like you like you use
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.720]  it now right like you've gotten used to it you've made it part of your life
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.000]  and now wouldn't you like a version that that sounds even better so i think
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.600]  i think it will do better because of the existence of the mini
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.680]  which is feels counterintuitive yeah yeah but i think there's something
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.560]  there too yeah yeah i i think you're right that you
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.000]  kind of needed they they maybe they didn't know it when they started but
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.840]  they kind of needed a friendly ah what the hell i'll buy one and then
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.800]  you find out how much you like it and now you're like yeah i want one with the
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.280]  big bass and i want a stereo pair and and etc and so forth it's a great
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.160]  product i still think the other problem that they face
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.200]  is that to me the true home pod experience is
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.600]  600 with a pair and it's great that if you really
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.200]  need only need one for a smaller room or
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.640]  whatever the purpose that you can just buy half
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.960]  of a pair but that's what i think when you just buy one you should be thinking
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.920]  i'm only buying half of a true home pod and maybe that's what you need but
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.080]  fundamentally the real experience of the product is a 600 pair of two of them
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.040]  whether it's in your tv or filling up a room yeah it is i feel
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:04.640]  like there is a you kind of this is not how
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.520]  apple operates and you know never say never but like
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.120]  if they were like oh or buy two for 500 i think yeah
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.640]  takers i gotta be yeah and get them in a box where they're paired together
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.560]  already yeah maybe and then i mean people i i
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.200]  have a sonos arc hooked up to my tv and that is a not cheap sound bar and i
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.960]  feel like you know people will drop 600 bucks on
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.840]  some nice home theater speakers or what have you
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.280]  uh i don't think that's out of the question at all i think it just
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.240]  and that was the other thing was like i think the sort of the proof of concept
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.240]  for the home theater angle came later i want to say like and i
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.200]  think maybe you needed still need like a newer apple tv to get
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.440]  like the full effect out of it i don't remember
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.360]  um but i think that's also a selling point as well as the home theater angle
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.360]  and it did not start out of that gate that they pushed that i i also think
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.480]  they're up against it because i don't think the typical person out there even
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.680]  if they're a fan of apple and you buy lots of apple stuff that i don't think
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:03.360]  people really believe how good a stereo pair of
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.640]  home pod sounds and that i've seen people and readers who
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.720]  write to me and they'll be like you know i'd do it if it were better
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.800]  than my 500 or 800 sound bar but i'm sure it's
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.920]  not and it's like ah actually i think it probably is i really
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.600]  do and i think it's sort of the thing that the solution to that chicken and
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.240]  the egg problem is to get it started and get you know
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.840]  people come go to somebody's house like mine where you can watch a movie with a
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.480]  home pod pair to a nice tv and be like wow that i
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.680]  can't believe that sound is coming from two home pods that's amazing
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.360]  and it does sound it does sound a bit like surround sound it does sound like
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.160]  stuff is coming from behind and from way further to the side than the
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.600]  home pods actually are uh and then you're like then it puts it
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.600]  in your head that this really is a credible this is a
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.880]  bargain for 600 i really do think it is yeah what one of the things that kills
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:03.120]  me on this is i you know if i all i did on my tv was
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.800]  watch stuff via my apple tv i probably would use a home pod stereo
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.160]  pair there but if you have anything else connected to your tv
[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.640]  like a gaming console it's a non-starter and it's just that to me is the bummer
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.040]  part is like i you know it's great that it has the
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.280]  wireless connectivity with the apple tv uh and it does use the erc standard but
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.600]  i don't it's not quite there's any way yeah i i think as time
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.200]  goes on i think this erc is going to it'll it'll eventually work
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.080]  you know but i don't think that with existing
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.040]  consoles and tivos and other things anything hdmi that you have hooked up to
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:42.640]  your tv the odds are somewhat good that you'd
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.320]  still need some other audio solution um yeah and i have to ding it slightly too
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.520]  and i have it in my office and i've i have used it
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.440]  i have for output from my mac but it it in
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:59.280]  like it's flaky still like and that's my biggest issues
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:03.280]  like why why is it not just a like a great pair of mac speakers and there's
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.040]  also some latency so for example if i'm editing a podcast
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.160]  i can't you can't do it it just doesn't it doesn't work it's not
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.520]  because it's going over wi-fi right like there's going to be some there's going
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.640]  to be some latency and some traffic issues there which is a bummer
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.560]  uh all right let me take a break here and thank our second and final sponsor
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.440]  of this episode our good friends at collide
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.800]  if you're listening to this podcast the odds are good that at some point
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.240]  you're going to go you or your company is going to go through an audit
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:38.080]  like soc two or iso 27001 if those ring a bell to you
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.560]  then you really ought to look at collide because you're going to have to answer
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.440]  some tough questions about endpoint security when you get audited
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.040]  questions like do all of your company's laptops have their disks
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.360]  encrypted does everyone have the company's password manager installed
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.120]  do you have a system in place to monitor and maintain compliance throughout your
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.400]  cross-platform fleet even if you're confident the
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.440]  answer to all of those questions is yes the question when you're audited is can
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.720]  you prove it to the auditor if you're not quite sure
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.400]  how you'd go about proving compliance across your fleet of devices then you
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:16.480]  need collide collide k-o-l-i-d-e is an endpoint
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.560]  security tool for the mac windows and linux devices that does
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.160]  things mdms cannot and it gives you visibility the
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.280]  visibility you need to maintain compliance and best of all
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:32.160]  collide does not resort to surveilling employees or locking down devices
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:35.360]  instead it works with end users to resolve issues
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.640]  and relies on their cooperation and informed
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:45.440]  consent where do you go you look you can meet your security needs
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.200]  needs and pass your audit without compromising on privacy

[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.600]  thing here i don't know what you're talking about a foldable ipad with a
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:19.760]  kickstand what's this this was a this was a um you know a
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.840]  rumor so i didn't know how much credence to give it but it was
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.560]  i think it was Ming-Chi Kuo who was saying in 2024
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.320]  uh apple will be putting out a foldable ipad with a kickstand
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.080]  and i'm just i don't even know what's happening
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.360]  here uh this has been in the i think he posted on twitter but it's been you know
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:44.080]  showing up on all the usual suspects uh and saying basically there there may
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.960]  be no new ipad releases in the next nine to twelve
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.320]  months which i think there have been a lot of sort of
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.000]  speculation that the ipad is going to have kind of a quiet year
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.520]  um and this maybe there is a larger or a bigger change to come and i mean i know
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.200]  we've heard about other other stuff um you know taking sort of a
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.480]  bigger change in next few years rumors about touch screen max and all
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:10.480]  that i just think the the the foldable
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.920]  you know market is such a weird idea and yet
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.000]  something that does not seem like it's going away
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.120]  and i have to believe apple is at least you know experimenting and
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.840]  investigating whether these things are plausible
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:27.280]  i just i'm i don't know like the there's what the surface
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.400]  what's the surface one there's a surface one that has two
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:33.680]  screens this is weird i don't know they're all duo
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.960]  all of their products are named in a way that i they all
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.160]  sound like they could be the other the names don't get so the
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:44.960]  this the surface that folds yes there you go the surface that they
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.520]  should have called it that that's a great fold i don't know
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.680]  at least yeah at least samsung names their foldable ones the galaxy fold or
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:55.760]  something like that so you know what's the hell it is um
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:59.760]  speaking of anyways i i thought speaking of speed bumps the ultimate speed bump
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.320]  product in the lineup has got to be the ipad
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:08.640]  pros which are pretty much unchanged since 2018 i know that the big 12.91
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:14.960]  at now starting last generation has the micro led screen so it has a
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.280]  better screen technology but again side by side
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:24.560]  a 2018 ipad pro of either size compared to one that you buy today
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:28.160]  same size same weight same more or less thing
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.200]  but on the other hand the chips keep getting faster
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.920]  for people who use them and it is a good design it is very thin it's very light
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:39.840]  side to side so it you know is is it a five a design that
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:45.680]  is worth five years yeah i think so but yeah i i i'm fascinated by it because
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.200]  it's like the like the mac you know i think apple has run into
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.720]  this issue of their hardware being so good yeah that
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.400]  it feels like okay we've come out with a new ipad we speed bumped it and
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.280]  everyone's like oh this one this one's it's like your ram you know you know
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.880]  your 64 gigabytes of ram and not paging out like you know
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:08.960]  okay it's great like i mean but now that i've hit this point
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.560]  like what else what else do i need right and i think that's an interesting
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.120]  challenge it's for apple to be in of having this the
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.040]  hardware that is so good that it feels like well you've
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.200]  kind of you kind of nailed it right like there's surely there's always room for
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.240]  improvement but i don't know what that is i always pull out to
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:33.120]  as my example of uh purely fictional purpose for
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.520]  foldable devices the the tablets and phones whatever you want to call them
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.720]  on hbo's westworld which if you've never watched you can i
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.320]  pretty sure you should be able to youtube
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.840]  clips of people using them um obviously there that takes place in
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.960]  the future and they're super thin they don't have any frame
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.720]  they're just clear pieces of plastic that light up when they turn them on but
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.040]  they fold to what we consider phone shape
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.840]  and you could put them in a pocket where you would hold what
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.680]  we today consider smartphones but they unfold them
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:15.280]  to a very nice tablet size and right you know putting aside all
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:22.080]  technical difficulties screen technology hinges
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.320]  bad where do you put batteries you know the ones in westworld don't seemingly
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:30.640]  have batteries you know but in theory you the appeal of that is
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:35.440]  tremendous right it's like you know sure think back to the old days
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.880]  when we had paper maps in our car you know and of course it was very
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.920]  difficult to fold them back up the right way but
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.800]  you certainly wouldn't want a road map of your state or the country or half the
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.560]  country that was the size that would fit in your dashboard
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.040]  but you certainly wouldn't want to keep the map out if you couldn't fold it up
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.440]  if it's big folding is great there's a reason folding has been around with
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.760]  paper products as long as there's been paper so
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.640]  can't help but think eventually folding is going to come to the apple universe
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.400]  and that they've just been waiting until they can do it right because in my
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.720]  opinion all the ones i've seen like from samsung with their phones the
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.520]  ones that are actually available for sale don't seem the trade-off doesn't
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.000]  seem worth it it's like you know they fold up and they're
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.680]  twice as thick why would i want a phone that's twice as thick why do i want
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.600]  you know now the and the good screen is now folded up inside and there's
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.520]  another extra screen on the outside just so i can look at it without
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:41.760]  unfolding it it all seems convoluted i don't know many people who use them
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.280]  uh you know they must sell well enough that
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.320]  samsung keeps making them but i guess apple will get there
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.920]  um well it's the whole it's the whole thing we always say because apple
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.400]  doesn't do its data tests in public right
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.800]  when they're when they're ready they're ready and they're not going to show off
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:00.080]  anything until they feel like it's good enough that they wish but it certainly
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:03.120]  would be at a basic level if apple thinks they have a good solution
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:07.760]  certainly a a a big way to take the ipad to new
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.640]  territory by i guess two ways it could go right
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.880]  you could take ipads with a maximum screen size like we know now
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.480]  in that 11 to 13 inch range and have them
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.920]  fold up to be far more portable than they are now
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.440]  possibly pocketable that would be a kind of amazing to be
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.280]  able to put an ipad in your pants pocket or like a
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.200]  jacket pocket um famously you know apple loves to
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.160]  talk about how their ipads are used in medicine
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.760]  uh it's actually a known fact now that the
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.440]  you know doctors wear those white lab coats that all the pockets on all lab
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:50.400]  coats are now meant to hold ipads because ipads are
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.200]  so often used in medical situations most of us
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.040]  don't wear lab coats all the time awkward for everybody else it's true
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.560]  yeah so pocketability would be amazing for a ipad it really really would
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.920]  or i guess the other way they could go would be to make a much
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.560]  larger maximum size but have it fold up to be as portable as the ipads today you
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.160]  could have a 16 inch or i don't know even bigger 20 inch
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:20.240]  unfolded ipad display i'd like to see it i'm sure it's coming
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.560]  i don't know i'm other than ces demos of products that are not meant for the
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.560]  market i've never seen a foldable phone that i've thought oh i would buy that
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.160]  it's it's still they're too thick when folded the hinges are too obvious
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.120]  doesn't seem reliable but ces always every year ces has something and it you
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.360]  know they work as prototypes and there's people touching them and they light up
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.320]  and they work and it's like wow that would be pretty cool if it was practical
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.240]  to actually sell in the mass market this year
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:51.920]  i remain convinced it's all just it's all special effects now it's todd
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.280]  visiri's out there making making foldable phones and treating us all into
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.560]  thinking they're real uh other than that though i'm done i'm
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.120]  done for the week uh anything else you wanted to talk about
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.040]  uh are you on the are you on the mastodon
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.480]  i am unmasked i knew the i knew that answer that i've been there for that was
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.160]  a cheat it was a cheat question i follow you there
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:17.520]  are you happy yeah i i yeah i am i i've dialed way back on twitter i still
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.240]  check in every once in a while just to like keep my
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.520]  finger on what's like going like check my mentions that kind of thing but i
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.080]  honestly you mentioned at some point that you
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.520]  were not really even seeing much still not engagement at all it's something
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.200]  that's yeah yeah me neither i've also it's been very quiet over there and i
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.080]  can't tell is like is it really just everybody who was
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.400]  actually like not a bot following me is is gone
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.920]  or is there something screwed up with their infrastructure i don't know but i
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.840]  you know i think the only thing right now that i'm not as
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.000]  you know kind of full-throated on mastodon is i just i
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.360]  still need a better mac client but i've been using ivory on my iphone and my
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:01.040]  ipad and i love it i'm a tweetbot user so that is it just feels like home to me
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.560]  um so i'm very excited about that mac mac uh
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.200]  app that they're doing i i i'm but yeah it's nice it feels good
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.320]  the i can i can report i'm allowed to say the mac
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.080]  ivory is uh coming along i i'm lucky enough i was in i'm as of this
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.040]  weekend using i don't even know i don't even
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.960]  know what they're describing it as they're
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:26.880]  they're describing it as not even alpha but it is already
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.080]  yeah everything you know if you used tweetbot for mac
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.440]  it is it'll make you feel at home even though it's slightly different
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:36.960]  um can't come soon enough for everybody else they know it
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.080]  god bless them i hope they're getting some sleep over there
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:45.600]  uh it is uh super exciting times ui wise though and and you know there are other
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.400]  ones coming some of these other ones all through
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.160]  so far through catalyst um but uh mammoth which is still in test
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.680]  flight as we record but might be out by the time the show comes out is
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.920]  got a pretty credible mac thing yeah i've been using it from the
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.160]  mac for a while and it's it's pretty i mean there's lots and lots of
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:09.280]  little things like the keyboard navigate yeah well it's still an
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.040]  it's still an ipad it's fundamentally still an ios app and
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.560]  like it but it works there's a while there during the beta where every time i
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.920]  try to post something yes yeah i was like well
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.520]  that's that's a non-starter but oh well but it was still good for reading
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.640]  but it is kind of fun when you're a nerd and you're willing to put up with stuff
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.800]  like that it's kind of fun to be in on it
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:34.400]  such early days um i i yeah it's got a nice bleeding edge
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.280]  feel to it i mean i don't know lots of people have compared the current
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.400]  mastodon feeling like twitter circa you know 2007 or 8 and it does bring
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.160]  me back to those you know to those times i think i think
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.800]  the best thing i've i've sort of said about mastodon is
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.080]  that i think it's a really good place for interacting with
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.760]  people like twitter became a place where it was about interacting with
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.120]  you know there are brands and there's news and there's public figures and all
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:03.360]  of that and i feel like you know that's a niche
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:06.160]  that's been carved out and i don't know that mastodon will replicate that but
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:08.720]  for just sort of straight up talking to people that you
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.720]  might be interested in talking to or hearing from
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:16.240]  i think it actually is pretty great and you know i told my wife the other
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.640]  night because i've been trying to convince her to use it more
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.000]  uh the best thing about about mastodon is there is
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.400]  no way that donald trump will ever figure out how to sign up for it that's true
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.280]  uh i hate to say it sounds elitist but i don't mean it in an elitist way i just
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.240]  spoke about this at length last episode of this show with craig hagenberry so i
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:38.320]  won't go too deep but it sounds elitist but i don't mean it
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.840]  that way but i think that the higher barrier to entry conceptually
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:46.960]  works in mastodon's favor for the type of
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:50.080]  people who for lack of a better catch-all
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.920]  listen to podcasts like the talk show or upgrade or
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:59.440]  a slightly nerdy you know and you have to make this level of conceptual
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.200]  leap to a two-level namespace where you're at username
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:10.960]  at instant server um and you have to i i you know
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.080]  i really i'll repeat myself a little but it's like i think
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:20.800]  that back when twitter switched it made that big pivot in 2013 or so
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.280]  to move away from fully embracing and supporting third-party clients
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.440]  and moved away from just having a chronological timeline
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:33.280]  that they did it because they they knew they to justify their existence
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.800]  financially and the goals they'd set in the money they'd raised they needed more
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:40.240]  hundreds of millions more users and they weren't going to get them with twitter
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:44.240]  as it was because most people look looked at it
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.680]  and it just didn't appeal to them and an
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.240]  algorithmic timeline that suggests things to them made
[01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:55.280]  hundreds of millions or at least tens of millions of more
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.840]  people see twitter as oh yeah this is something i would use on a regular basis
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.960]  now it just it worked and as frustrated as
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.160]  many of us are who like what twitter was before
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.920]  that i i get it it wasn't popular to those
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.080]  people so forget even the do i even understand it i think people
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.880]  who got on hundreds of millions of people who use
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:20.160]  twitter and at least find it engaging enough to keep using
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:24.240]  will never like mastodon because mastodon is never going to present them
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.720]  in the algorithmic timeline and the non-algorithmic timeline isn't
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.840]  something that entertains them or engages their brain or feels
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:36.160]  entertaining and so for those of us who do mastodon is it and it's
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:39.920]  it really is it's backwards it's you know stepping into it but
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:45.920]  in some ways elon musk did save twitter by ruining twitter and therefore
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:50.240]  creating critical a critical mass of millions of
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.520]  people who are like in my what i see on mastodon now
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.280]  uh who never otherwise we're never going to
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.680]  go through the hassle of closing up shop on twitter and moving to mastodon
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:07.200]  it's it's really exciting times and it's so exciting it's the
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:10.640]  yeah it's been a very long time since something grassroots
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:17.840]  open and non-profit has experienced commercial explosive growth as a
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:21.120]  platform on the internet and it sounds it's
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.160]  depressing that it's been so long because that used to be what the
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.360]  internet was all about one thing after another some new open
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.400]  thing and you can anybody can write a client for it
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.760]  and it's a new stuff is happening and oh my god here's a new client that does
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.360]  things in an altogether different way wow that's really clever i don't know
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.960]  maybe that's for me maybe it's not but i'm glad someone's trying it
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.960]  and you know here we are again and it's it's very exciting
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.320]  uh so i'm not going to shut up if nothing else it's not static yeah i'm
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.520]  not going to shut up no i i like this stuff is changing i will
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.800]  answer this it's a frequently asked question at this point and i'm sorry i'm
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.480]  not there yet will there be an ad-daring fireball and
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:06.480]  at the talk show accounts that auto post new episodes and posts on mastodon
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.920]  yes 100 i guarantee it is are they ready yet
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:14.000]  no so coming soon uh
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.520]  let me just say this let me give a shout out to your work
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.800]  you've got you're you're a novelist god damn it it makes me
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:25.760]  a little jealous it's it's in the back of every writer's mind that you should
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.200]  you know someday write a novel it's it's a
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.280]  it's a it's a lot of time uh not always the best return but i
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.080]  i heard that i heard it pays great
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.560]  well it does i mean it's no podcasting money don't get me wrong but all right
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:48.240]  what are you up to you're up to three novels i've and i've written
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.800]  four novels um four novels uh the galactic cold war
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.960]  series is my current going concern most recent one the nova incident came
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.680]  out last summer um working on a couple other things
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:04.240]  right now and i should have something coming out i don't
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:07.920]  exactly know when but i think in the first half of this year
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.960]  there should be something that is a different thing um
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:15.040]  which i i don't know how much i can say about it at this point other than
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.480]  it's um uh well i'll give a quick uh overview it's actually a supernatural
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.080]  detective novel that's set in boston and involves uh spooky goings on at a
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.760]  giant technology company so maybe a little more in my wheelhouse and perhaps
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.040]  uh even in the wheelhouse of some of the listeners here so uh
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.000]  look for that i'm sure i'll be writing a lot about it when you're saying you have
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.400]  more real world actual experience with
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:41.920]  technology companies than you do with intergalactic uh
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:48.160]  cold wars slightly plus you know spooky ghosts and stuff too you know let
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.600]  me ask this here's my question the three novels so far in
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.000]  the series are titled the caledonian gambit
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.240]  the bayern agenda and as you said the latest one the nova incident
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.440]  there's one more in there as well there's the alaf extraction oh yes
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.360]  right all right extraction but so i see the pattern
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.520]  one of them was it everyone says they there's there's a gambit
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:19.520]  there was an agenda there was an extraction
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:24.080]  there was an incident how many of those do you have in the can
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:30.240]  for the future um oh man yeah you gotta have a couple i
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.640]  don't want to hear them i'm not asking oh yeah there are a couple
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.000]  there are a couple there are at least a couple in the can i will say this i when
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.840]  i when i wrote my first book no no title i've ever come up with my for
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.960]  my book like no first title has ever survived
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.640]  to the pro to the final publication they always get changed
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.760]  and the first time when i was doing my first book
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:53.120]  they didn't like the title i had and so they asked me to brainstorm some other
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.360]  ones and i was like coming up with joke titles
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:59.360]  and the caledonian gambit was my like robert ludl i literally called it my
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:03.520]  robert ludlum title like born identity all his books are the
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:07.280]  something something and then i just got stuck like once you
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.880]  start a pattern once you start like a like a you know the
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.320]  way you're doing something you just keep going with that same
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:16.720]  pattern you kind of fall into that trap so
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:21.360]  uh yeah so i have come up with ones for future installments if need be
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:25.360]  and um yes they do all sort of fall in that same
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.600]  the something something so uh people can find out more about your books at your
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.200]  your personal website d moran d m o r e n dot com
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.800]  and you've got as somebody would expect all of the links you could possibly want
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.560]  to buy them in any form you want i would have to think the queen of that
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.080]  sort of novel titling pattern slash conundrum of where do you
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:55.440]  finish has got to be sue grafton right oh yeah and she died before she could
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.920]  finish so what are the it's terrible she got
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.440]  like within i think she was on like x or something it was pretty close to the end
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.880]  well i'm looking at her website and there's a y is for yesterday
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.240]  and okay so maybe that's the last one she got so
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.680]  that's that's killer you'd die before you get to that last letter in the alpha
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:16.000]  you get 25 and then you i just i mean and i was in
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.960]  high school when those first started coming that's a long time ago
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:22.240]  my mom had a bunch of them because she's a mystery yeah and at some point that
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.680]  was one of those novels where i was like i don't read mysteries and
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:28.800]  but somehow at some point i was bored and there was one and i read it and i
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.640]  was like hey these are pretty good uh and then i got all caught up and of
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.960]  course everybody you know like any series novel the fans cannot wait
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.600]  for the next one but of course with hers there's this
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.560]  whole there was this whole cottage industry of people trying to predict
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.240]  what the title for each letter would be right
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.920]  you know right yeah it was like when android with yeah
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.440]  they're doing all the candies whatever right exactly and people would try to
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.040]  guess you know what's the candy you know j for jellybean that seems
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.520]  pretty obvious but what the hell do you do with x
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:04.000]  or you know what and you know they gave up on it
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.720]  yeah right well they they've kind of painted themselves into a corner
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.640]  uh anyway people can find that there of course in terms of mac
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.800]  nerdery uh you are the what's your official title the east coast
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.600]  uh bureau chief which is a title i have because i told jason man
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.320]  pure chief yeah title that doesn't get used enough anymore you want to be a
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.560]  bureau chief be a bureau chief it's like that's east coast
