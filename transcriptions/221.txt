[00:00.000 --> 00:04.840]  My laptop, I had to get a new one because I dropped my old one in a very unfortunate
[00:04.840 --> 00:10.280]  turn of events and I ran that one from scratch because I stupidly didn't get a big enough
[00:10.280 --> 00:15.840]  hard drive to just copy everything over and man, it is, it's awful, it's awful just trying
[00:15.840 --> 00:16.840]  to get everything.
[00:16.840 --> 00:17.840]  What a rookie.
[00:17.840 --> 00:18.960]  Remember all the weird stuff you have installed.
[00:18.960 --> 00:19.960]  Rookie move.
[00:19.960 --> 00:22.800]  Well, no, because I had to buy it on an emergency though.
[00:22.800 --> 00:23.800]  Ah, I see.
[00:23.800 --> 00:24.800]  I was traveling.
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.260]  You had to get the one that's in the Apple store and they've only got like the 512.
[00:29.260 --> 00:30.260]  They had one with 512.
[00:30.260 --> 00:31.260]  Yup.
[00:31.260 --> 00:33.120]  And so I bought the big, one with the biggest hard drive that I could get, so.
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.200]  Yeah, I could see that and that, that, that's, that's really where it sucks that you can't
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.720]  upgrade shit like that anymore.
[00:39.720 --> 00:40.720]  I don't.
[00:40.720 --> 00:49.280]  Because I would just, I would just, I would just, uh, uh, buy the one, you know, if you
[00:49.280 --> 00:50.280]  could.
[00:50.280 --> 00:51.280]  Yeah, you should just sell the whole machine.
[00:51.280 --> 00:55.560]  But what I would do is if I had to buy like an emergency one and got like 512 instead
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.960]  of one terabyte and in the hypothetical world where you could swap it out, I would swap
[01:00.960 --> 01:06.360]  it out when I could and tell myself I'll just, you know, sell that 512 and then the 512 will
[01:06.360 --> 01:11.760]  just sit on a shelf in my office for 10 years until it's worth nothing because it doesn't
[01:11.760 --> 01:13.400]  fit in any more computers.
[01:13.400 --> 01:14.800]  Oh, that's right.
[01:14.800 --> 01:18.960]  I don't, I don't think I've ever actually, I rationalize buying new things.
[01:18.960 --> 01:22.160]  I say I'll buy the old thing, but I never, I never ever actually sell the old thing.
[01:22.160 --> 01:27.120]  I think I could actually profit by hiring a personal assistant in at least the first
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.200]  month and have this assistant just to sell your old, just tell my old shit.
[01:31.200 --> 01:36.920]  I believe that I can, I can, I can hire an assistant at a, at a very generous hourly
[01:36.920 --> 01:44.040]  rate and still come out ahead based on all the electronics in my office that I really
[01:44.040 --> 01:45.040]  know.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.040]  It should sell.
[01:46.040 --> 01:48.040]  Ben, how are you doing?
[01:48.040 --> 01:49.680]  Yeah, I'm, I'm doing okay.
[01:49.680 --> 01:50.680]  How are you?
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.040]  I'm good, you didn't take this bucks, the bucks lost too hard, did you?
[01:55.040 --> 01:58.880]  You knew they were going to lose.
[01:58.880 --> 01:59.880]  It's complicated.
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.320]  I, I, I'm, I'm refusing to deal with it emotionally and stuffing it into a dark place that will
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.720]  come out in an unexpected way 10 years down the road.
[02:05.720 --> 02:10.680]  For those of you who don't know, Ben, Ben is a lifelong, well his favorite sport is,
[02:10.680 --> 02:16.880]  is basketball and pro basketball at that and his favorite team is, is his home team, Milwaukee
[02:16.880 --> 02:20.320]  Bucks and they, they were in the playoffs this year.
[02:20.320 --> 02:21.320]  First time in a while, right?
[02:21.320 --> 02:25.720]  I mean the Bucks have, no, they're, they're, they're there last year.
[02:25.720 --> 02:29.520]  The problem with the Bucks is they are, they are a beacon of mediocrity.
[02:29.520 --> 02:34.120]  They've, they've regularly, they're either not in or they're in like the eighth seed
[02:34.120 --> 02:35.120]  for many years.
[02:35.120 --> 02:38.480]  Or pick up the seventh seed, you know, right, which is fine.
[02:38.480 --> 02:42.600]  The problem now is we have Giannis Antetokounmpo who is, you know, like one of the top, you
[02:42.600 --> 02:44.920]  know, I think everyone agreed to top 10.
[02:44.920 --> 02:46.400]  How would you, how do you pronounce his last name?
[02:46.400 --> 02:47.880]  I just know, I just say Giannis.
[02:47.880 --> 02:50.440]  I honest to God, I don't, I don't even try.
[02:50.440 --> 02:53.400]  And I've got on my wife's side, we've got family that's Greek.
[02:53.400 --> 02:56.780]  So I mean, I'm used to trying to pronounce Greek names, but man, how do you say it?
[02:56.780 --> 03:00.760]  So because it's not a Greek name, it's Nigerian, it's Adenokounmpo.
[03:00.760 --> 03:05.600]  So the original spelling is actually, it's very, it's very easy to, it's very easy to
[03:05.600 --> 03:07.640]  spell because it's quite straightforward.
[03:07.640 --> 03:10.040]  Let me, let me see if I can look it up here.
[03:10.040 --> 03:17.360]  So the official spelling was, where is it, A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.600]  So you just, you just say it how it was.
[03:19.600 --> 03:20.600]  Oh, well show me that.
[03:20.600 --> 03:23.960]  Well, you got to paste that into the chat because I can't spell it verbally.
[03:23.960 --> 03:27.760]  You know, you can't tell me how something is spelled and I can't, I can't see it.
[03:27.760 --> 03:29.160]  That makes so much sense.
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.800]  So they, so what they did is they took his Nigerian name and then they, they, you know,
[03:32.800 --> 03:35.920]  his family, they moved to Greece, Greece, Greece-ized it.
[03:35.920 --> 03:36.920]  Oh, that's great.
[03:36.920 --> 03:37.920]  Oh man.
[03:37.920 --> 03:38.920]  That name, I, oh man.
[03:38.920 --> 03:43.040]  If I were doing it play by play, I would just have that, I would have that on the paper
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.420]  in front of me spelled like that.
[03:45.420 --> 03:46.720]  That's like a phonetic spelling.
[03:46.720 --> 03:47.720]  It's actually right.
[03:47.720 --> 03:49.800]  It's, it's actually not that hard to pronounce at all.
[03:49.800 --> 03:50.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:50.800 --> 03:51.800]  Just the...
[03:51.800 --> 03:52.800]  Is that right?
[03:52.800 --> 03:53.800]  Am I saying it right?
[03:53.800 --> 03:54.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:54.800 --> 03:55.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.800]  You emphasize the, yeah, it's more the, you said it right, but it's more the emphasis
[03:56.800 --> 03:57.800]  of the syllable.
[03:57.800 --> 03:58.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:58.800 --> 03:59.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.800]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O.
[04:00.800 --> 04:18.160]  A-D-E-T-O-K-U-N-B-O, yeah, so he was, yeah, so when he got Greek citizenship, he, the,
[04:18.160 --> 04:19.160]  the spelling of his name changed, which wasn't until actually May, May 2013, but, so, yeah,
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.160]  that's why.
[04:20.160 --> 04:21.160]  Well, he's, he's definitely top ten.
[04:21.160 --> 04:22.160]  I don't, I don't think, I think if they, if they decided to have a new draft and every,
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.040]  you know, like, every player is eligible for the draft again, I, I would say he'd go before
[04:26.040 --> 04:27.040]  ten easily.
[04:27.040 --> 04:28.040]  Especially...
[04:28.040 --> 04:30.360]  Oh, if there was a new draft, he'd be top, he'd be top three.
[04:30.360 --> 04:33.320]  He might even be top one, just because he's only 23 years old, so.
[04:33.320 --> 04:35.760]  Well, what if, what if, but what if they did it every year?
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.560]  Like, like, the age thing is, is unfair if we're gonna, if we're gonna have a hypothetical
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.160]  we're gonna draft again, you know.
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.240]  I'm saying, though, if you were gonna pick up a play, you know, like, like if every season
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.560]  started as a pickup game, and you only had him for one year, because the next year you're
[04:49.560 --> 04:52.280]  gonna do the same thing, I still think he'd be top ten.
[04:52.280 --> 04:56.720]  Yeah, I think he'd probably be five or six.
[04:56.720 --> 05:02.400]  You know, LeBron, Curry, Durant, and Harden go first, and then, I think Anthony Davis
[05:02.400 --> 05:06.200]  and Giannis would be the next two, in some order.
[05:06.200 --> 05:09.720]  I think Giannis' advantage is he handles the ball more than Davis, whereas Davis needs
[05:09.720 --> 05:13.040]  someone to give him the ball more, but, I mean, Davis has just been, he's a year older,
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.760]  or a couple years older, and it's really showing, he's been absolutely incredible these playoffs.
[05:16.760 --> 05:20.080]  But if you were starting from scratch again, just given his age, he would probably be the
[05:20.080 --> 05:21.080]  number one pick.
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.960]  Yeah, that's, that's a good, that's a good bet.
[05:22.960 --> 05:27.600]  23, I mean, geez, I mean, it's, it's, you know, in the old days, that's when the players,
[05:27.600 --> 05:28.960]  that was when they were rookies, you know what I mean?
[05:28.960 --> 05:32.400]  I mean, you just gotta, you know, he has a whole career ahead of him.
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.800]  Yep, absolutely, but, but, you know, the point is, it makes it way worse.
[05:36.800 --> 05:42.680]  It makes the Bucs organizational incompetence, and lack of queers of command, and ownership
[05:42.680 --> 05:47.440]  in fighting, and, like, just no plan, having no plan for the future, just kind of scruffing
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.280]  along season by season, that's fine when you're just kind of resigned to being a small market
[05:51.280 --> 05:54.760]  middling team, you can enjoy the rest of the league, which is how my basketball viewing
[05:54.760 --> 05:55.920]  experience has gone.
[05:55.920 --> 06:00.920]  It is five million times worse when you, like, the most difficult piece in, winning a championship
[06:00.920 --> 06:03.480]  in the NBA is the most difficult feat in team sports, by far.
[06:03.480 --> 06:07.160]  Like, there's only five teams, I think, that have won more than three championships, and
[06:07.160 --> 06:09.920]  like 70% of the championships have been won by those five teams.
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.540]  Like, like, the reality is, it's very, very, very hard to win, and you, because you need
[06:14.540 --> 06:19.240]  a few ingredients, first and foremost is you have to have, like, a top, a top five player,
[06:19.240 --> 06:23.920]  maybe a top ten player, but realistically a top five player, and we have that, and yet
[06:23.920 --> 06:29.560]  everything else with the team is just slathered in incompetence, and it's, and this series
[06:29.560 --> 06:34.840]  is a perfect example, just terrible coaching, terrible habits, lots of mismatched pieces,
[06:34.840 --> 06:38.880]  and we lost to a team missing, you know, two of its best players, and, and it's embarrassing,
[06:38.880 --> 06:39.880]  so, you know.
[06:39.880 --> 06:44.960]  A friend of the show, Paul Kofasis and I were talking about this, now he's, Paul and I are
[06:44.960 --> 06:49.200]  not as into pro basketball as you, but Paul is a Boston Celtics fan, that's his home team,
[06:49.200 --> 06:54.640]  and you know, I, I, when I was a kid I was a big time Celtics fan, because I loved the
[06:54.640 --> 06:59.600]  bird era Celtics, and, and basketball was my sport that I played, it was the only one
[06:59.600 --> 07:03.600]  that I had really, I liked baseball, and I wished to hell, oh, how I wished I could hit
[07:03.600 --> 07:10.320]  the baseball, but I, I, everything I hit was, like a, like a practice ground ball right
[07:10.320 --> 07:13.120]  to the short stop, every, every goddamn time.
[07:13.120 --> 07:17.540]  That's funny, so I'm the exact opposite as you, I, I desperately want to be good at,
[07:17.540 --> 07:21.720]  at basketball, but I was much better at baseball, baseball's by far, was, was probably the sport
[07:21.720 --> 07:22.720]  I was best at.
[07:22.720 --> 07:28.240]  Basketball was my, it was my game, and I could shoot, and I was a little slow, and I would
[07:28.240 --> 07:30.720]  play pickup games in college, and, and as soon, and I swear.
[07:30.720 --> 07:31.720]  But you're tall, from who haven't seen you.
[07:31.720 --> 07:35.680]  I am a little tall, and, and so, I, I, in Drexel we'd be, we, I would play a pickup
[07:35.680 --> 07:41.240]  game, and immediately, like, you know, like, you know, five minutes in, people who I'd
[07:41.240 --> 07:45.440]  never played with before would start calling me bird, because, you know, it's a lot of
[07:45.440 --> 07:50.280]  black people, a lot of black guys, and I'm, you know, maybe, like, two or three of us
[07:50.280 --> 07:54.720]  were white, and I could shoot the three, and I could pass, and they're like, oh, check
[07:54.720 --> 07:59.280]  out Larry Bird, and it was, I, I, I would be like, ah, come on, and then inside, I was
[07:59.280 --> 08:01.580]  like, oh, that's my dream.
[08:01.580 --> 08:06.440]  So I love the bird era Celtics, but I, I, you know, once, once Jordan retired, I got
[08:06.440 --> 08:10.160]  away from the NBA for a long time, and, you know, I, I root for the Sixers now, I, I like
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.360]  the way these, this team plays.
[08:11.360 --> 08:15.440]  So anyway, Sixers are in the playoffs, Bucks are in the playoffs, Sixers won, Bucks were
[08:15.440 --> 08:18.840]  playing the Celtics, took it to seven, and if they would have won game seven, it would
[08:18.840 --> 08:26.480]  have been Bucks, Sixers, and I, before that game seven, I tried to entice Ben into booking,
[08:26.480 --> 08:32.520]  booking a trip to Philly, where we, we could go see, go see the Bucks and Sixers play,
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.480]  and to, to book it before the game, and I couldn't get Ben to bite.
[08:37.480 --> 08:44.720]  Probably. I, I, I'm a Bucks fan, I, I, I anticipate the worst, always. The, the, the, on, the,
[08:44.720 --> 08:48.440]  the light at the end of the tunnel is always an oncoming train. So the, yeah, it's interesting,
[08:48.440 --> 08:52.760]  it's going to be a replay of the 80s, I think, because the 80s, it was always the Celtics,
[08:52.760 --> 08:56.360]  it was the Celtics, Sixers, and Bucks that were the top of the conference every year,
[08:56.360 --> 08:59.000]  and then either the Celtics or Sixers would knock the Bucks out in the second round of
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.160]  the playoffs, and they'd play in the conference finals, and then the Celtics would usually
[09:02.160 --> 09:03.160]  win, but the Sixers won occasionally.
[09:03.160 --> 09:06.880]  Yeah, but I think it's going to be the same, except the Sixers are going to be the best
[09:06.880 --> 09:10.680]  of, of the three. So in this case, I think the Bucks, one of those two will knock the
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.680]  Bucks out, the honest Bucks out in the second round every year, and then the Celtics and
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.200]  Sixers are going to play, and the Sixers are going to win most of the time. That's my,
[09:17.200 --> 09:19.000]  that's my prediction of the Eastern Conference for the next, for the next several years.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.160]  I was too young, I was too young to remember specifically the era, except just, you know,
[09:24.160 --> 09:27.440]  it was like my dad would be flipping through and would, you know, would, you know, my dad's
[09:27.440 --> 09:30.880]  a sports fan, we'd watch, but in the early years of that rivalry, the Sixers actually
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.440]  had the better of the Celtics, because the Sixers beat the Celtics in the final, in a
[09:35.440 --> 09:40.640]  Eastern Conference finals in the 80, then went on to lose to the rookie Magic Johnson
[09:40.640 --> 09:46.560]  Lakers, and then 81, the Celtics won it all, but then in 82 was the year the Sixers won
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.520]  it all. So two out of those three years, 80 and 82, the Sixers beat the Celtics in the
[09:50.520 --> 09:54.360]  final, in the Eastern finals.
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.160]  That's right. Well, maybe it could turn out that way, particularly if, if, you know, we'll
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.240]  see how Embiid's career goes. I mean, if he's, you know, in the long run, able to stay on
[10:02.240 --> 10:05.320]  the court, then that could end up being the case. I mean, Celtics are obviously set out
[10:05.320 --> 10:10.120]  phenomenally well, the Sixers are, they all have a long-term process, a plan. That's the
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.240]  other thing about winning a title, you need that key player, but then to get all the pieces
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.720]  to fit and under the salary cap and all that sort of stuff, like it, it requires a multi-year
[10:18.720 --> 10:22.840]  plan, and the Bucks can barely plan their next five minutes, much less, like quite literally
[10:22.840 --> 10:25.800]  if you watch their games, much less the next five years.
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.880]  So Paul, Paul Kefasis and I were talking about this the other day, about this, and I think
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.840]  that, I think this is, I don't know enough about hockey, so forgive me, those of you
[10:35.840 --> 10:41.480]  who are sports fans and who are hockey fans, but I kind of think hockey is more like baseball,
[10:41.480 --> 10:46.960]  basketball, pro basketball, in the regard that I'm about to talk about, which is that
[10:46.960 --> 10:56.840]  the best team is very likely, the better team is way more likely to win in basketball than
[10:56.840 --> 11:04.680]  in any other sport. Baseball, there's so much luck involved in the postseason, and a single
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.960]  person, a pitcher, and how well that pitcher does in any given game, and it's just the
[11:09.960 --> 11:15.080]  nature of baseball, you know what I mean? Like, it's, there's nothing quite like it
[11:15.080 --> 11:18.840]  where, you know, you could have two guys on base and a guy hits a home run right down
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.320]  the line, and two feet one way it's fair, and a three-run homer, and two feet the other
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.520]  way it's foul, and you get nothing. There's just nothing like that in basketball. There's
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.960]  no one possession in a game, you know, where so much can swing on such small variants like,
[11:33.960 --> 11:39.800]  you know, which way is the wind blowing? So baseball, it really takes a lot of luck, and
[11:39.800 --> 11:40.800]  football...
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.480]  I think, yeah, I think hockey, because hockey you have the goalkeeper, or this goalkeeper,
[11:45.480 --> 11:52.200]  the goalie, that can get hot and can impact the game, like, hugely, so I think hockey's
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.360]  probably more in the middle, but basketball is, that's why it's the hardest sport to
[11:56.360 --> 12:00.800]  win, because it consistently, the best team wins, and if you're the best team one year,
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.120]  you're extremely likely to be the best team next year. Like, it's a sport of dynasties.
[12:05.120 --> 12:06.120]  Right.
[12:06.120 --> 12:10.360]  It's just the, and especially because the thing with basketball is, there's so much
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.120]  return to having the best player. I mean, like, so it's, but it's not like a goalie
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.080]  where you can get hot and control the game, but if you have the best player over a seven-game
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.480]  series, you're just gonna win most of the time, and again, that's why it's so frustrating
[12:22.480 --> 12:25.040]  watching that last series where you had the two best players and still gonna win, but
[12:25.040 --> 12:26.040]  I digress.
[12:26.040 --> 12:30.520]  Well, and the problem with football in terms of having the better team win, and it is pretty
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.880]  likely, but because it's a one game, one and done, that, you know, one or two bad things
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.000]  can happen to the better team, and because you only get one game in the playoffs in football,
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.200]  you know, that adds to the luck, whereas basketball, you get seven games, it's the best of seven,
[12:46.200 --> 12:52.680]  and then in each individual game, you're talking, you know, somewhere in the order of 50 to
[12:52.680 --> 12:56.640]  60 scoring attempts per team, so there's a, it.
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.960]  No, closer to more than that, closer to, I mean, closer.
[12:58.960 --> 13:01.800]  Well, I mean scores, actual scores. I'm sorry, not scoring attempts.
[13:01.800 --> 13:02.800]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.480]  Yeah, all right. Well, but that's even a better number. You get, what, over 100 scoring attempts
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.360]  per team, and so you kind of get into the long run in each individual game in a way
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.600]  that you don't in baseball, or football, but anyway, and so anyway, what Paul and I were
[13:16.600 --> 13:22.760]  talking about, how is in a way, it can make, it makes basketball the most fair of the pro
[13:22.760 --> 13:27.080]  sports, because the best team in the league is by far more likely to win the championship
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.600]  than the best team in the other leagues is, but it actually makes it a little bit less
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.160]  exciting, especially to the casual sports fan who's like, oh, I want to watch the playoffs.
[13:37.160 --> 13:44.400]  It's like, baseball can be terribly exciting, because, you know, a team with a relatively
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.160]  mediocre record who slipped into the postseason with a wild card has a pretty good chance
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.600]  of beating the best team in the league, whereas in basketball, the eight seed is not going
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.040]  to beat the one seed unless there's some kind of injury to a star player.
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.800]  Yep, that's exactly right. I think, and that's why I think with basketball, like it's a,
[14:00.800 --> 14:03.680]  like Golden State's going to win the title this year. Like everyone's kind of known that
[14:03.680 --> 14:08.960]  for the beginning of the season. So I think there's an aspect of people, if you, if all
[14:08.960 --> 14:14.840]  you care about is just like the outcome, then it's going to be a less fulfilling sport.
[14:14.840 --> 14:19.000]  But if you love basketball, if you, I mean, if you love the sport though, it's like the
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.080]  ride, the ride is the, is the journey, right? And you know, there's a, there's an aspect
[14:23.080 --> 14:28.000]  of the NBA in particular, because the NBA has been so incredibly, there's lots of things
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.440]  the NBA has done, right? One big thing is like their social media policy. Like you can
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.200]  post whatever clips you want of the NBA, like on YouTube or on Twitter or whatever, and
[14:36.200 --> 14:40.160]  they like don't police it at all. I mean, you can go back and watch old games from the
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.600]  eighties on YouTube and, or, and you'd like, you know, I just sent you a clip of this crazy
[14:44.600 --> 14:49.000]  dunk in this, in this Houston, Utah game. And like, unlike the NFL, which just police
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.480]  everything, like you can do whatever you want. And part of, and part of that is what's come
[14:52.480 --> 14:56.560]  up is there's a huge, just especially among young people and in general, and you follow
[14:56.560 --> 15:01.920]  like that house of highlights channel, right? The like, it's all NBA clips one because they
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.920]  make great clips and two, like there's no restriction on it. And so just kind of being
[15:05.920 --> 15:10.560]  a part of the, the sort of like, particularly among, I think younger people, just part of
[15:10.560 --> 15:14.400]  the zeitgeist, like the NBA is so much more a part of it. And then the NBA too, you also
[15:14.400 --> 15:18.020]  have that aspect where the star players are super visible. They're not behind a mask that,
[15:18.020 --> 15:22.260]  you know, they have a big impact on the game. And then the, you know, the off season and
[15:22.260 --> 15:26.240]  player movement and trades becomes almost as big a deal as like what's happening in
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.560]  the season. Like, it's like, it really is sort of like the soap opera, most soap-esque
[15:32.560 --> 15:38.420]  of all the leagues and, and all that stuff. And then Twitter is like, Twitter is such
[15:38.420 --> 15:45.400]  an amazing experience for the NBA in particular. Like there's a, like the NBA lives on Twitter,
[15:45.400 --> 15:52.040]  like Twitter, like they are sort of inseparable. And and yeah, if you're sort of into that,
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.760]  it's one of those things where it's easier to get deeper and deeper and, and in a very
[15:56.760 --> 15:59.760]  sort of enjoyable way in the best sort of, in the best sort of way.
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.480]  Yeah, that's true too. And now that I'm easing my way back into a little bit more NBA fandom,
[16:04.480 --> 16:07.840]  you know, not just this year, but you know, in the last few years, but like last summer
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.080]  I paid a lot more attention to the off season and it really caught on on Twitter as to just
[16:12.080 --> 16:20.280]  how almost like, like, like if there was an NBA show about, you know, a fictional version
[16:20.280 --> 16:28.360]  of the NBA, like the off season episodes would be better than the in season episodes. Like,
[16:28.360 --> 16:34.060]  I really mean it, no joke, in terms of like intrigue and like stuff to like argue about
[16:34.060 --> 16:38.880]  on Twitter, it goes like, all right, post season is the most interesting, but the off
[16:38.880 --> 16:42.800]  season is more interesting than the regular season. It really is.
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.360]  Right. Well, it also, because it involves all the teams too, right? And Hope Springs
[16:46.360 --> 16:50.520]  Eternal and everyone's like, this might be the year. And, and also there's the, I think
[16:50.520 --> 16:53.840]  the other thing that's really interesting too is going back to that, if you're a certain
[16:53.840 --> 16:58.440]  sort of person, like because there is that sort of longterm nature to winning a championship,
[16:58.440 --> 17:02.100]  it really does take years and you act like Sam Henke and Philadelphia in the process
[17:02.100 --> 17:06.200]  and we're going to tank, you'll be bad for many years. And like, there's so many opportunities
[17:06.200 --> 17:09.680]  for like genuine disagreement. You know what I mean? Like you can have a philosophical
[17:09.680 --> 17:12.760]  debate about that. You have a tactical debate and you have a strategic debate. You can have
[17:12.760 --> 17:16.160]  a like, you know, the world is falling apart debate. Like there's so many angles to just
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.440]  like argue about endlessly. Like it really, like it really is tailor made for Twitter.
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.240]  I mean, cause what is Twitter? If not a forum to argue endlessly.
[17:22.240 --> 17:28.360]  All right, let's get into the show. I got some follow up from last week's show. I was
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.120]  Jim Dalrymple on, I have two points I want to, I want to clarify one when we were talking
[17:32.120 --> 17:39.120]  about this new Google chat RCS thing that they're pushing as sort of a successor to
[17:39.120 --> 17:45.800]  or not even sort of it, they're pushing it as a successor to SMS. I think I got lost
[17:45.800 --> 17:49.880]  in the, it literally, it literally is a successor to SMS. I think that's the thing that people
[17:49.880 --> 17:54.440]  get are kind of gotten, got, it got lost in the details a little bit. Like it's not a
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.680]  chat service. Right. It is literally, but they're calling it. So there's two things
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.340]  that are confusing about it that I, and I think they threw me off. One is that it's
[18:04.340 --> 18:09.880]  from Google and we're just used to Google coming out with and on an annual basis, a
[18:09.880 --> 18:15.160]  new, all right, here's, here's our new, we're not putting a new name on the old thing. We've
[18:15.160 --> 18:20.960]  got an altogether new idea to get people to chat. And so we're just, I'm used to that.
[18:20.960 --> 18:27.600]  And so I attribute way too much of it to Google as a possible central centralized role in
[18:27.600 --> 18:34.320]  this thing. And then two, the name chat. Right. But it really is just like a next generation
[18:34.320 --> 18:45.000]  SMS. But the thing that I think I would like to whatever, adjust my statement on is on
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.560]  a quote unquote encryption versus end to end encryption. End to end encryption is the only
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.120]  encryption that would matter in a messaging service. And if it's not end to end encrypted,
[18:55.120 --> 18:58.600]  it might as well not be encrypted at all. Like some kind of encryption that only takes
[18:58.600 --> 19:03.000]  the first hop from the device to some, you know, wherever it goes before it gets to the
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.700]  destination but isn't encrypted after that is better than nothing, but barely better
[19:08.700 --> 19:12.040]  than nothing. Really all that matters is if it's end to end encrypted because otherwise
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.200]  zero it's, and it's not just, I think Jim and I got too caught up thinking about like
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.360]  the protection from like law enforcement and, and government snooping and stuff like that.
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.360]  There's all sorts of bad actors that could get involved, including whoever it is that
[19:25.360 --> 19:30.120]  runs your wifi. If it's not you, if you're like in an airport or a coffee shop or even
[19:30.120 --> 19:35.560]  just it, you know, somebody in your family that you don't trust, you know, you know,
[19:35.560 --> 19:39.520]  like if you're the kid in the family and maybe you've got like a problem with the stepfather
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.880]  or something like that, you know, if you don't, if you don't have end to end encryption, you
[19:42.880 --> 19:48.720]  really can't trust your communication. So if end to end or bust is the point I would
[19:48.720 --> 19:54.200]  like to make. And I think I was kind of mushy on that last week.
[19:54.200 --> 19:57.440]  Yeah. And the other thing, the other thing that I would say, cause I didn't talk about
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.900]  it on, I wrote about it last week, but I didn't talk about it on next one. So this is a chance
[20:00.900 --> 20:04.920]  for me to talk about it too, is the point that I was trying to make when I was writing
[20:04.920 --> 20:12.560]  about this is I think folks were a little hard on Google in, in that there is a, like
[20:12.560 --> 20:16.560]  there's a theoretical world and there's like the real world that we actually live in. And
[20:16.560 --> 20:22.400]  what I mean by that is all these current end to end in encrypted chat services, they're
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.360]  all centralized. That centralization is critical to how they work because it's a centralized
[20:27.360 --> 20:30.520]  player that handles the key exchange. And you know, we'll give you the vagaries of like
[20:30.520 --> 20:35.640]  how, how encryption works, but basically the person sending you a message has to have your
[20:35.640 --> 20:40.260]  key. And then in this aspect of the RSV is sort of like communication before the communication
[20:40.260 --> 20:43.760]  and it can't be initiated by the sender. It has to be initiated by the recipient. Like
[20:43.760 --> 20:48.280]  it's very weird, right? I have to give you, I have to give you the means to contact me
[20:48.280 --> 20:53.400]  for you to contact me. But how do I know that you want to contact me if you know, like it's
[20:53.400 --> 20:56.800]  what Apple does for example, or WhatsApp or whatever it might be, or Signal, they all
[20:56.800 --> 21:02.120]  work this way, is they have a centralized server where that key is associated with a
[21:02.120 --> 21:07.480]  username or an ID, like your app ID or a phone number. And, and that centralization is how
[21:07.480 --> 21:12.040]  it works. And that's how, you know, Ello worked like Google's previous sort of chat offering.
[21:12.040 --> 21:18.560]  And the issue is that, that is, that is ideal, but if the carriers and OEMs are never ever
[21:18.560 --> 21:22.360]  going to make all of the default messaging servers or whatever else Google puts out there,
[21:22.360 --> 21:27.160]  there's no way they're going to agree on a centralized provider, right?
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.800]  Exactly, exactly. And yeah, and people are like, oh, well, what about HTTPS? HTTPS depends
[21:31.800 --> 21:36.240]  on centralized certificate authority. Like there has to be a central player. That's the
[21:36.240 --> 21:43.040]  only way that's always going to work. And also HTTPS, you know, HTTPS is really only
[21:43.040 --> 21:47.760]  possible because Netscape introduced it in 1994, whenever it was. Like it had to be there
[21:47.760 --> 21:51.320]  at the beginning and sort of built in. Like the question is how are you going to build
[21:51.320 --> 21:55.240]  something in the system as it is? And, and, and my point is that it's not theoretically
[21:55.240 --> 22:00.520]  possible to have a decentralized encryption sort of method because HTTPS shows you could.
[22:00.520 --> 22:04.880]  It's that realistically for all practical purposes, it's never ever going to happen,
[22:04.880 --> 22:08.760]  which meant, you know, Google was in a very sort of difficult position because their,
[22:08.760 --> 22:14.820]  their choice was the choice is not an end to end encryption or not end to end encryption.
[22:14.820 --> 22:21.240]  It's stick with SMS as crappy as it is, or make it better, but it's just like SMS, it's
[22:21.240 --> 22:25.280]  going to be unencrypted. And you could say that maybe they should stick with SMS and
[22:25.280 --> 22:30.720]  that way customers will, will themselves voluntarily go out and use something like WhatsApp and
[22:30.720 --> 22:33.880]  that's better for customers. But I think you could be a little sympathetic to Google's
[22:33.880 --> 22:38.160]  position why they, you know, why they would prefer to not have that outcome either.
[22:38.160 --> 22:42.840]  Yeah. The second point of follow up from the same discussion with the same show is Jim
[22:42.840 --> 22:52.120]  and I at my prodding, we're speculating on how many active iMessage users there are.
[22:52.120 --> 22:55.700]  Cause Apple doesn't talk about that and, and they've rarely, they haven't really talked
[22:55.700 --> 22:59.860]  about iMessage numbers period in a couple of years. The most recent was actually Eddie
[22:59.860 --> 23:06.400]  Q on this show like two years ago I think. And he said that they were doing a peak of
[23:06.400 --> 23:13.000]  200,000 messages a section a second, but I think that was from like March, 2016. So who,
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.400]  you know, who knows where that number is at now? And they haven't said anything recently,
[23:16.400 --> 23:22.440]  but I think the problem Jim and I made is, is we're ballparking. Well, how many active
[23:22.440 --> 23:30.000]  users of like iPhones are there? And, you know, maybe let's guess that half of them
[23:30.000 --> 23:36.200]  are using iMessage or something. I think Jim was a little bit more bullish than, than me,
[23:36.200 --> 23:40.480]  but I think the thing that both of us sort of overlooked on the fly and, and our American
[23:40.480 --> 23:48.280]  central centricism is to blame is that we, I knew this, but I really didn't think of
[23:48.280 --> 23:55.200]  it on the spot is just how different messaging is used country by country around the world.
[23:55.200 --> 24:00.720]  And you know this, you know, we've, you've, you're the one who opened my eyes to it. But
[24:00.720 --> 24:06.080]  it's, I think the best word to phrase it is Balkanized. You know, it's here in the US
[24:06.080 --> 24:17.000]  SMS is hugely popular. But amongst iPhone to iPhone users, iMessage is. iPhone to iPhone,
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.880]  you know, communication is in my experience, largely iMessage. But there are places in
[24:24.880 --> 24:28.040]  countries in Europe, a lot of countries in Europe, maybe most countries in Europe that
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.000]  are dominated by WhatsApp. And I was talking to people on Twitter about it this week. And,
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.120]  and my question is, well, is it in this mixed group of people you're talking about, are
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.600]  there a lot of Android users? And the answer is yes, there's a lot of Android users. So
[24:40.600 --> 24:45.160]  therefore iMessage really can't be the thing. You know, it wouldn't work like it does for
[24:45.160 --> 24:50.860]  me where almost everybody I chat with is on iMessage. So it's like by being on iMessage
[24:50.860 --> 24:57.560]  and ruling out Android people, I don't, I can't remember the last SMS I got that wasn't
[24:57.560 --> 25:04.520]  from like some kind of automated service that still uses SMS for, you know, confirmation
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.320]  codes or something like that. But for actual personal communication, I honestly think I
[25:09.320 --> 25:14.380]  really do. I think it's been months since I've gotten an SMS. I don't, I don't know
[25:14.380 --> 25:19.920]  people who have Android phones. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Well, but I'm just saying certain countries
[25:19.920 --> 25:26.440]  in Europe, it's WhatsApp. Other places, Facebook messenger, I know Facebook messenger, it gets
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.320]  a lot of use in the US too. But not among people I know. And then in, you know, countries
[25:31.320 --> 25:40.360]  like in Asia, there's apps like Line and China has WeChat, right?
[25:40.360 --> 25:46.000]  Yeah, no, I think you're exactly right about the balkanization. And I would say in the
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.600]  vast majority of countries in the world, it is something other than SMS. Because one thing
[25:51.600 --> 25:58.160]  that's weird at the US because the US was behind in SMS, but then the carriers all bundled,
[25:58.160 --> 26:02.480]  most people end up getting unlimited talking text plans. And that's kind of like when SMS
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.320]  really exploded because people in the US weren't paying for it. But in most other countries
[26:06.320 --> 26:10.240]  in the world, people have always paid for SMS messages. And that's why when like WhatsApp
[26:10.240 --> 26:15.320]  came along, like WhatsApp's biggest feature by far was it was that it was basically the
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.640]  exact same as SMS, but it was free. And there is no greater sort of feature when it comes
[26:19.640 --> 26:24.880]  to acquiring customers. And that's the challenge with all these services is the number one
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.240]  feature of any of these services beyond being free, of course, is are your friends on it?
[26:29.240 --> 26:33.960]  And so once one sort of gets a hold, it's very, very difficult for something else to
[26:33.960 --> 26:41.600]  come along. So I think the line is kind of Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, WeChat is in China,
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.720]  South Korea is Kakao, and basically the rest of the world is all WhatsApp. Like WhatsApp
[26:44.720 --> 26:48.680]  is super, super dominant. And the one big exception is the United States. The United
[26:48.680 --> 26:55.280]  States, because of that sort of weird SMS remains stronger, is very sort of a fractured.
[26:55.280 --> 26:59.920]  iMessage is obviously a big deal there. And I think in the context of Google and this
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.040]  chat slash RCS sort of effort, it's really, I think, first and foremost about the North
[27:05.040 --> 27:09.840]  American market. It's about having a competitive offering to iMessage because right now the
[27:09.840 --> 27:14.400]  Android experience for messaging is terrible unless you use a third party service. But
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.600]  using a third party service is challenging in the States in particular because it's not
[27:18.600 --> 27:24.680]  like everyone already has WhatsApp installed. And so that I think that's it's really about
[27:24.680 --> 27:31.080]  the U.S. And so in that respect, like your your U.S. centric experience is actually really
[27:31.080 --> 27:34.960]  all that matters when it comes to RCS, I think in general, because the rest of the world,
[27:34.960 --> 27:38.420]  it's all kind of that battle's been fought. It is what it is.
[27:38.420 --> 27:41.080]  And the funny thing, it's funny because you don't really I don't really think about it
[27:41.080 --> 27:49.920]  because it seems like such ancient history where you paid a noticeable amount for SMS.
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.680]  And I'm not quite sure when it when I can when I when I came to Taiwan, I had to pay
[27:53.680 --> 27:58.400]  like even though in the U.S. I had not paid for a long time. So the U.S. is unique here.
[27:58.400 --> 28:03.120]  And that's one of the reasons why the U.S. remains fractured in the messaging market,
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.320]  because there's never been that impetus to get away from SMS. I mean, like there's no
[28:07.320 --> 28:11.680]  there's no greater motivation to find an alternative to SMS than if you're paying for SMS and you
[28:11.680 --> 28:14.840]  don't have to pay for the other one. And whereas that's never been the case in the U.S.
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.360]  And it really changes behavior. Like if you only get 100 SMS messages from I mean, I used
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.160]  to be used to see those stories like 10 years ago, you'd see stories of people who, you
[28:23.160 --> 28:29.800]  know, had like a family plan with 500 text messages a month. And the teenager sent like
[28:29.800 --> 28:34.040]  five thousand of them and they get like a six hundred dollar phone bill or something
[28:34.040 --> 28:39.440]  like that. Like it was a noticeable amount of money. And it reminds me, you know, and
[28:39.440 --> 28:45.960]  in hindsight, it seems crazy that, you know, you would have like just a mere hundreds of
[28:45.960 --> 28:51.360]  text messages to send per month. You know, you get like six a day. And then after that,
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.040]  you start paying. And it reminds me of, you know, and when I think back to the days, I
[28:56.040 --> 29:02.720]  just think like, oh, my God, it is comical. And I, you know, it makes me feel old is long
[29:02.720 --> 29:08.840]  distance phone calls. Even like when I was in college, I spent a literal fortune. Me
[29:08.840 --> 29:16.000]  in Philly and Amy in Pittsburgh, I spent almost every dollar I had to my name other than like
[29:16.000 --> 29:25.360]  rent and ramen noodles on long distance phone bills. And so so for us who wanted to talk
[29:25.360 --> 29:30.000]  a long time on the phone, it we paid a lot. And then when I was a kid, it would be like
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.040]  if my grandparents called, it would be like, you know, John, come here, say hi. And it'd
[29:34.040 --> 29:37.160]  be like, hi. And I'd start telling a story and they'd like, yank the phone and they'd
[29:37.160 --> 29:43.600]  say, nope. Like, I remember my dad actually like watching the clock in the kitchen, like,
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.680]  because he knew that it was built. It wasn't by the second. It was by the minute. So he
[29:48.680 --> 29:53.960]  was damn sure to get off after, you know, before two minutes went by. Right. One minute
[29:53.960 --> 30:00.320]  and fifty eight seconds. Right. And it like totally informed like he's over it now. My
[30:00.320 --> 30:07.000]  dad is 80. And, you know, he's gotten past it. But even up until like 10 years ago, he
[30:07.000 --> 30:13.480]  would still if I talked to him on the phone, he'd be talking fast, even though we were
[30:13.480 --> 30:18.200]  no longer paying long distance phone bills. He'd still you know, he just had this sixth
[30:18.200 --> 30:22.480]  sense of this is cost. This is going to cost me a fortune. This is going to be one minute
[30:22.480 --> 30:29.360]  or less. That's funny. God, can you even imagine what you would pay to like talk to your family
[30:29.360 --> 30:37.280]  from Taipei to to Wisconsin if you were there like 25, 30 years ago? Oh, yeah. Well, I mean,
[30:37.280 --> 30:45.480]  I think you just didn't do it. I mean, when I first came here 15 years ago and you would
[30:45.480 --> 30:51.140]  go to the 7-Eleven and get a calling card and you'd get roped to a pay phone and use
[30:51.140 --> 30:55.120]  your calling card because it was by far the cheapest way, cheapest way to call back. That
[30:55.120 --> 30:58.560]  came down I think pretty quickly when I was there. I discovered within a couple of years
[30:58.560 --> 31:02.880]  that you could actually just call direct and it would be reasonable. But yeah, but obviously
[31:02.880 --> 31:07.640]  now it doesn't, you know, it doesn't really cost. It's totally free. I've told these both
[31:07.640 --> 31:13.420]  of these stories before, but they're worth retelling. When I was at Drexel in the early
[31:13.420 --> 31:19.640]  to mid 90s, we had a 7-Eleven on campus. I'm sure it's still there. Incredibly busy, incredibly
[31:19.640 --> 31:25.600]  popular, good, perfect location for a 7-Eleven on a college campus. Two or three paying pay
[31:25.600 --> 31:31.080]  phones out front. And somebody has told me that one day, like middle of the school year,
[31:31.080 --> 31:38.080]  that the pay phone on the right was giving out free long distance. And I said, who told
[31:38.080 --> 31:42.080]  you that? And he said, someone told him. And I was like, what the hell? But I was going,
[31:42.080 --> 31:46.200]  you know, I had to walk by it anyway. And so I picked it up and I got the dial tone
[31:46.200 --> 31:54.080]  and I called Amy's number and she, she picked up the phone and I was like, holy shit. I
[31:54.080 --> 31:58.080]  just, all I did, it just worked like a regular phone. I just picked it up. There was dialed
[31:58.080 --> 32:02.200]  her number and we had like, I had nothing. I wasn't really ready to talk to her, but
[32:02.200 --> 32:10.040]  I told her, you know, Hey, this is amazing. And I literally, the very next day, I swear
[32:10.040 --> 32:17.240]  to God, the next day I walked by and it was like, like the line to buy Pearl jam tickets.
[32:17.240 --> 32:25.640]  Like there, there must've been 30 people in line to use that phone. And they had chairs,
[32:25.640 --> 32:30.840]  they had chairs, they had like mugs, you know, like thermoses of coffee. And it was like
[32:30.840 --> 32:37.720]  all of the you know, Drexel, you know, like any school with its strong math and science
[32:37.720 --> 32:44.200]  department had tons of students from all over Asia. You know, it looked like it worked internationally.
[32:44.200 --> 32:50.600]  Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It worked anywhere in the world. So it was all of these you know,
[32:50.600 --> 32:55.360]  you know, like grad students from India and China and, and wherever else they were from,
[32:55.360 --> 32:59.080]  but they were, you know, it was, it looked like the United nations it was crazy. And
[32:59.080 --> 33:05.880]  then like later on that same day, I walked past again and there was nobody there. It
[33:05.880 --> 33:14.880]  got fixed. Oh my God. It was so funny, but like, why, why, why, why did it was preparing
[33:14.880 --> 33:18.120]  you for your future career, covering people, winding up for the iPhone. Yeah, exactly.
[33:18.120 --> 33:23.120]  All right. Let me take a break and thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at
[33:23.120 --> 33:31.040]  trace Pontas trace. Pontas sells freshly roasted gourmet coffee and it's shipped directly to
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.520]  you. Their coffee is roasted to order your order and shipped out immediately. They don't,
[33:37.520 --> 33:41.640]  it's not like they roast coffee and then they go put it on shelves and it stays there for
[33:41.640 --> 33:47.520]  a week or multiple week. And then, you know, your order comes in and they go get one and
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.960]  it's, it's fairly recent. No man. They, they, when they, they, they roasted and then when
[33:52.960 --> 33:57.820]  they roast it, that's when they start fulfilling the orders for that day. Like the coffee you
[33:57.820 --> 34:03.120]  get will have been roasted the day, day or the day before it ships out to you and it
[34:03.120 --> 34:06.880]  will ship, you know, beat it in your hands within a day or two. And it has the roast
[34:06.880 --> 34:10.520]  date printed clearly on the bag. So you know your coffee is fresh. Well, why does this
[34:10.520 --> 34:15.760]  matter? I'm telling you, it does matter. It makes a difference. Coffee is a grocery. Even
[34:15.760 --> 34:22.920]  roasted coffee is a grocery. It is like, like fruits or vegetables. Now it doesn't, you
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.000]  know, three week old coffee. It doesn't go rotten like a three week old banana, but it,
[34:28.000 --> 34:36.680]  it loses, it loses some flavor. It really does. Now Tres Pontas is a single farm coffee
[34:36.680 --> 34:44.440]  grown on the race family at their farm down in Brazil. And for generations, literally
[34:44.440 --> 34:50.040]  this family has been growing coffee down in Brazil for over a hundred years. Same family,
[34:50.040 --> 34:53.560]  but they've only been selling their coffee in Brazil until now. And now they're selling
[34:53.560 --> 34:57.120]  it around the world. And that thing, one of the things I love about this is you don't
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.720]  have to pick between like the 18 different flavors of coffee or varieties of coffee or
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.720]  something like that. They've got one coffee. They just have this big farm. They grow one
[35:06.720 --> 35:12.400]  type of bean. And what Tres Pontas does is they have different roasts, light roast, medium
[35:12.400 --> 35:17.380]  roast, dark, and the very darkest is French roast. So what you can, if you get started,
[35:17.380 --> 35:22.360]  you could just buy one of each. If you already know that you like a light or a medium or
[35:22.360 --> 35:28.600]  French roast, whatever, just get that. And if you can get it either whole bean or pre-ground
[35:28.600 --> 35:33.120]  in 12 ounce packages. It's really great stuff. I was going to tell you that I'm drinking
[35:33.120 --> 35:38.640]  it right now, but I finished my coffee before I got to this part of the show. It's already
[35:38.640 --> 35:45.160]  gone. It's, it's really great. So where do you go to find out more? There's two ways
[35:45.160 --> 35:53.280]  to get Tres Pontas. First, you can go to their website, trespontas.com slash coffee, trespontas.com
[35:53.280 --> 36:00.520]  slash coffee, or you can go to Amazon and buy it there. And when you buy it from Amazon,
[36:00.520 --> 36:05.040]  that's just the front end. It's just an easier way to do the transaction. The actual order
[36:05.040 --> 36:08.880]  is still fulfilled from the Tres Pontas people and the freshly roasted. You get the same
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.320]  freshly roasted coffee that you would if you went right to Tres Pontas and they don't care
[36:13.320 --> 36:16.560]  which way you buy it, whatever is easiest for you. Here's the deal though. They've got
[36:16.560 --> 36:21.380]  a subscription. If you keep, if you want to, you can sign up for a subscription and get
[36:21.380 --> 36:26.780]  fresh roasted beans sent to you every one, two or four weeks. It's your choice. And when
[36:26.780 --> 36:31.480]  you sign up for a coffee subscription, you save 10% on every bag of coffee. But listeners
[36:31.480 --> 36:38.040]  of this show get an extra 10% off. You save 20% by using the code, the talk show at checkout
[36:38.040 --> 36:43.680]  when you buy a subscription. So it means you get 20% off every bag in your subscription
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.800]  in perpetuity. And Hey, I'm telling you like something like this, if you like, you know,
[36:48.800 --> 36:54.800]  someone in your life, like a wife or your mom or your dad, your husband, father's day
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.100]  is coming up. Mother's day is coming up even sooner. Pretty good gift idea in my opinion
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.920]  to set, you know, if you know they like coffee, get them one of these subscriptions, get them
[37:02.920 --> 37:07.280]  a year's worth of subscription. And what a great gift. Then you don't have to, you don't
[37:07.280 --> 37:10.840]  have to worry about the getting a mother's day or father's day gift. Great idea. If you
[37:10.840 --> 37:15.160]  got a coffee lover in either of those roles coming up. So my thanks to trace Pontos. Remember
[37:15.160 --> 37:22.080]  that code, the talk show. When you go to their website to get a subscription we've got lots
[37:22.080 --> 37:25.920]  to cover. It's a good thing. We don't waste time. I wanted to talk about this just briefly.
[37:25.920 --> 37:32.500]  At least this there's a new book out from Ivan Seidenberg and I'm obsessed with this.
[37:32.500 --> 37:38.200]  This is one of the things, this is why I love my having my own website and I can just write
[37:38.200 --> 37:41.320]  about what I want to write about and I don't have to pitch somebody on this. Cause I imagine
[37:41.320 --> 37:45.260]  if I had to like pitch this as something I'm going to spend a day obsessing over, they'd
[37:45.260 --> 37:51.040]  be like, what the fuck are you talking about? John? But a former Verizon CEO, Ivan Seidenberg
[37:51.040 --> 37:56.560]  has a book coming out. He was the CEO, I don't know, until like 2011, something like that.
[37:56.560 --> 38:01.460]  So he was there. He was the CEO at Verizon when the iPhone came out in 2006 and he tells
[38:01.460 --> 38:09.280]  this story in his book that he was at the Allen and Company conference. You ever see
[38:09.280 --> 38:12.520]  that kind of, it's like that conference where Jeff Bezos was pictured looking like a bad
[38:12.520 --> 38:17.840]  ass with his sunglasses and a vest on. Forget where the hell it's held. But Tim Cook goes
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.240]  there now. All these industry big shots go there. And he tells this story in the book
[38:22.240 --> 38:29.440]  that he was, July, 2006, he was walking up to Bob Iger and Bob Iger had some kind of
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.620]  phone in his hand that he didn't recognize. And then he kind of served, you know, tried
[38:33.620 --> 38:37.760]  to put it away and he says, Hey, what was that Bob? And he says, Oh man, it's gonna,
[38:37.760 --> 38:45.240]  it's gonna change the world. But I guess, you know, can't show it to you. And he, Seidenberg
[38:45.240 --> 38:52.240]  thinks it was an iPhone because Iger, Bob Iger knew Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs is on the
[38:52.240 --> 38:59.200]  board at Disney. They have the whole Disney Pixar relationship. I think that's crazy.
[38:59.200 --> 39:05.320]  The more I think about it, the crazier I think it is. And I don't know if Seidenberg is,
[39:05.320 --> 39:10.440]  is being just being a fool by, you know, and he had that, you know, he had, I don't know,
[39:10.440 --> 39:17.840]  like a ESPN phone or something like that or if he just made the whole story up. But there's
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.700]  no way in my, in my mind, there is no fucking way that Steve Jobs is letting anybody outside
[39:22.700 --> 39:27.720]  Apple have an iPhone six months before it was even announced in a full year before it
[39:27.720 --> 39:37.720]  actually came out. No way. Yeah, no, no. The iPhone didn't even work at the introduction.
[39:37.720 --> 39:42.180]  That was what made the introduction part of what made it so amazing. Well, you know what?
[39:42.180 --> 39:46.840]  So it, it definitely struggled to get through the demos and, and stories I've heard. Yeah,
[39:46.840 --> 39:51.960]  I mean, I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but there's no way, there's no way it was usable by anyone
[39:51.960 --> 39:57.160]  not at Apple, but six months before it was even unveiled. I've heard since I started
[39:57.160 --> 40:04.240]  obsessing on this, I've heard that it's plausible it or possible it's, it's implausible, but
[40:04.240 --> 40:11.840]  it's possible. And you know, that it wasn't as bad as you might think. And that the press
[40:11.840 --> 40:17.480]  demo units in January, 2007 might've been crippled in different ways. You know, that
[40:17.480 --> 40:22.460]  they like the, I didn't get to see one that I was too far out of the loop, but like Jason
[40:22.460 --> 40:28.440]  Snell and Andy Anatko and Glenn Fleishman all got to see. And I think like do a little
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.920]  hands on with, with the iPhone in January, 2007. And what those guys all said was that
[40:33.920 --> 40:37.120]  there were certain apps, like the ones that you would think of more as like widgets, quote
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.420]  unquote, like calculator and the stocks and a few others were literally just screenshots.
[40:42.420 --> 40:46.720]  Like you'd tap the app and it would show a screenshot of the calculator, but you, there
[40:46.720 --> 40:52.320]  was nothing you could do. It was just a screenshot of the calculator UI. I've heard, I heard
[40:52.320 --> 40:57.840]  yesterday from somebody who, who would definitely know, um, that that's not really a reflection
[40:57.840 --> 41:03.920]  of like what Apple themselves were using in January, 2007. They were, it was, those units
[41:03.920 --> 41:07.580]  were set up that way because they, there was just so much, the ones that Apple was using
[41:07.580 --> 41:11.800]  had so much other stuff they didn't want people to see. You know, it was almost like there
[41:11.800 --> 41:16.120]  were two kinds of iPhones in January, 2007. That makes sense. The ones that Apple themselves
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.580]  were using internally and then a special version of the OS cooked up for the press and probably
[41:21.580 --> 41:27.000]  a third version, which was the ones that were cooked up for the on stage demos, you know,
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.400]  but that makes sense too because there's no, there's no way they could go from like non
[41:29.400 --> 41:34.160]  functional to shipping in, in, in five months either. That's exactly, that's almost exactly
[41:34.160 --> 41:39.680]  word for word with the, the little birdie I talked to yesterday said. Um, but still,
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.840]  like he said, Jan, July, 2006, he said it was wrong. But the other thing too, and this
[41:44.840 --> 41:50.200]  just came out today, there's a guy on Twitter. Uh, I've only got his handle here. John Apple
[41:50.200 --> 41:57.160]  two, three, five. Let me see if he's got his real name on Twitter. Uh, Nope. I don't think
[41:57.160 --> 42:03.720]  it's his real name, but John Apple, uh, noted, I'll put this in the show notes. Um, it's
[42:03.720 --> 42:08.720]  got four stalls, excellent interview at the computer history museum last year with, um,
[42:08.720 --> 42:13.000]  John Markoff formerly for the New York times. And he told some great stories about the development
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.340]  of the iPhone. But he said like in the early days for a long stretch, there were only two
[42:17.340 --> 42:25.520]  people in the world who had iPhones to carry around and uses their daily, uh, driver phone,
[42:25.520 --> 42:29.640]  Steve jobs and Scott forestall. I'll put a link in the show notes to that part of the
[42:29.640 --> 42:35.080]  video, but he tells this funny story where he said like he'd have his iPhone and you
[42:35.080 --> 42:39.440]  know, it'd be getting ready to go to bed and get like a fry or Saturday night, you know,
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.320]  he'd get a phone call at 11 and he'd be like, Scott, it's Steve. And he'd say, I'm at this
[42:43.320 --> 42:47.640]  party on board. So I went to the bathroom and he goes, I've been looking at the calendar
[42:47.640 --> 42:52.240]  and I'm thinking about where, where we're putting these labels and forestalls. I don't
[42:52.240 --> 42:55.720]  want to go too far into it. He tells us better than I could, but he's like, so I opened my
[42:55.720 --> 42:58.600]  calendar app and I started looking and I'm like, okay. And he's like, yeah, and this
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.000]  icon, I don't think the shade of blue is right. I think we got to, I think we got to move
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.000]  it in this direction and whatever. And then, you know, he'd be like, we'd talk for like
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.280]  half an hour and he'd be like, Oh damn, somebody's knocking on the door. They probably think
[43:10.280 --> 43:19.040]  I'm constipated. I got to go. It's not just another, another sort of data point here too
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.280]  is there, there was a wall street journal story in February, 2007, a month after the,
[43:24.280 --> 43:29.840]  a month after the announcement about how Apple showed the phone to singular wireless, because
[43:29.840 --> 43:36.760]  which was, you know, AT&T was then called wireless. And and they, the CEOs of singular
[43:36.760 --> 43:41.960]  wireless did not see the iPhone until a month before. Right. So they like, they had been
[43:41.960 --> 43:46.920]  negotiating the deal and they'd been working together for two years. So like, like singular
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.280]  knew it was coming, but they were, they were not allowed to even see the finished device
[43:51.280 --> 43:55.480]  until December and Apple was announcing in January. So if Apple is not showing their
[43:55.480 --> 44:00.160]  cell phone partner, the phone, like what are the chances they're showing Bob Iger? It seems
[44:00.160 --> 44:06.280]  quite, quite low. And even if it's, you know, like why would you show Bob Iger and why would
[44:06.280 --> 44:10.240]  you trust him to keep it secret when even in the anecdote that claims that this is what
[44:10.240 --> 44:16.480]  happened, he was using it at this conference where he was in eyesight of the Verizon CEO.
[44:16.480 --> 44:23.400]  Like if the story is true, it would, the story itself would explain why Jobs would have been
[44:23.400 --> 44:28.480]  an idiot to let Bob Iger have one. Well, not just that, but, but Apple, if there actually
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.360]  ever were negotiations with Apple and Verizon, it would have happened before that point because
[44:32.360 --> 44:37.080]  the decision about what wireless radio to use would have had to have been made long
[44:37.080 --> 44:40.840]  before then. I mean, especially given that Apple and Apple, it already takes two years
[44:40.840 --> 44:44.660]  to build an iPhone today when Apple is building the first one and they have to actually learn
[44:44.660 --> 44:50.040]  how to do cellular transmission for the first time. It sure as hell took longer than two
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.400]  years to figure that, figure that out. So, you know, if there were, if there were ever
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.360]  any sort of negotiation with Verizon, it would have had to have happened before July, 2006.
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.560]  Yeah, it's just a weird story and it's very, I find it very, very hard to believe. And
[45:01.560 --> 45:06.480]  I think it's bullshit. Whether he's lying about it or whether he's just being an idiot
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.800]  and that it was like a sidekick, you know, or some, one of those phones or something
[45:10.800 --> 45:15.880]  like that, who knows? But I really, I would bet heavily that it was not an iPhone and
[45:15.880 --> 45:22.360]  I'm going to take Scott Forstall's word that there were only two people because the two
[45:22.360 --> 45:26.240]  people who he says had it are the two people who I would believe.
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.520]  Yeah. That also sounds like a very Forstall sort of story to stay, to emphasize that was
[45:31.520 --> 45:37.040]  him and Steve Jobs that had it. That's, that's, that's a very in character anecdote for Scott
[45:37.040 --> 45:44.680]  Forstall. Right. I don't have anything more to add about that though. All right. Next
[45:44.680 --> 45:52.000]  topic I've got here is airport base stations are now end of life. And I, I actually knew
[45:52.000 --> 45:59.380]  about this last week the day that Jim and I recorded, but it wasn't out yet and wasn't,
[45:59.380 --> 46:04.960]  so we just didn't talk about it. And it's funny because I think if we, if I had talked
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.360]  about it last week, I would have had a slightly different take than I do now that I've had
[46:09.360 --> 46:14.920]  a week to think about it. Interesting. Give us, give us both. What was the original? Well,
[46:14.920 --> 46:23.480]  the original take I think is almost best summarized by a, there's a tweet by Dr Drang. Do you
[46:23.480 --> 46:28.880]  follow Dr Drang on Twitter? He's like, of course. That guy's fantastic. So here's his
[46:28.880 --> 46:32.880]  tweet. I'll put it in the show notes. The airport is like the laser rider, something
[46:32.880 --> 46:36.940]  Apple had to make to push computing in a certain direction. Both products hung around well
[46:36.940 --> 46:41.840]  after that push was no longer necessary. And I would say saying that, and if you don't
[46:41.840 --> 46:47.400]  remember the laser rider and when Apple was in the printer business and how revolutionary
[46:47.400 --> 46:55.160]  the laser rider was, it was remarkable. It really was. In 1985 Apple introduced the laser
[46:55.160 --> 47:03.440]  rider and fundamentally altered the nature of printed business communications. In 1986,
[47:03.440 --> 47:10.280]  the laser rider plus was introduced, bringing even greater flexibility to the printed page
[47:10.280 --> 47:16.160]  with the laser rider and the laser rider plus Apple has today become the leader in the desktop
[47:16.160 --> 47:23.640]  laser printer market. However, new opportunities are developing in the areas of higher throughput,
[47:23.640 --> 47:31.800]  lower cost and greater flexibility. As application areas grow, so does the demand for more sophisticated
[47:31.800 --> 47:42.240]  laser riders. To meet this need, Apple has created the laser rider two family of printers,
[47:42.240 --> 47:51.400]  the second generation of laser riders. The laser rider two NTX, a high performance expandable
[47:51.400 --> 48:01.640]  network laser printer. The laser rider two NT, the mainstream network laser printer.
[48:01.640 --> 48:10.520]  And the laser rider two SC, an entry level single user laser printer. NTX, for networkable
[48:10.520 --> 48:20.180]  and expandable. NT, for networkable. SC, for SCSI interface. It was like, the first thing
[48:20.180 --> 48:24.640]  was that most printers back then were like dot matrix printers and they were loud, noisy,
[48:24.640 --> 48:29.760]  and so low resolution is to be almost laughable. I mean, you actually get better resolution
[48:29.760 --> 48:35.560]  output out of like a cash register with the heat transfer. And you could, you know, like,
[48:35.560 --> 48:38.920]  yeah, you can still see the pixels on those things even today. It was like, you could
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.920]  see that not only could you see the pixels, they weren't really even aligned right. And
[48:43.920 --> 48:49.200]  then you, all of a sudden you have this $300, 300 DPI laser printer, where every is always
[48:49.200 --> 48:57.880]  a lot more than $300. Not 300 DPI, I said. And also, you know, setting up the idea of
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.760]  a printer on a network. And if you were going to spend as much as a laser rider cost in
[49:02.760 --> 49:10.880]  the mid eighties, just to drop it in, it launched in 1985. It was a $6,995, which is the equivalent
[49:10.880 --> 49:17.440]  of $15,916 today. So it was, it was the price of a small car, basically. So if, yeah, imagine
[49:17.440 --> 49:24.640]  spending $15,000 on a, on a printer today. But in like certain environments, like you
[49:24.640 --> 49:32.560]  know, some kind of like a shared computer lab at a college or you know, an office or
[49:32.560 --> 49:39.480]  especially if you worked in the graphic design industry it was worth it. It was almost a
[49:39.480 --> 49:43.140]  no brainer, but you'd need to, you know, you wouldn't want to have it hooked up to one
[49:43.140 --> 49:48.240]  printer. Like, you know, like imagine if Ben was the guy who had the laser rider. Hey Ben,
[49:48.240 --> 49:54.680]  I need you to print something for me. Hey Ben, print this again. Ah shit, I had a typo
[49:54.680 --> 50:00.620]  Ben, give me another copy. You know, it had to be networked and setting up a network printer
[50:00.620 --> 50:06.860]  in 1985 or 1986 was like, forget about it. And then Apple, you know, came up with local
[50:06.860 --> 50:14.040]  talk and relatively inexpensive and normal. You didn't need any kind of IT pros or computer
[50:14.040 --> 50:18.880]  experts. It was every, like everything that the Macintosh exemplified. You'd buy these
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.440]  things, you'd hook them up into the serial port on the back of your Macs and you'd go
[50:24.440 --> 50:30.700]  to the chooser and there as an output was the laser rider and you'd click on the icon
[50:30.700 --> 50:38.520]  and then every time you hit command P in any app, it would show up as the output and you'd
[50:38.520 --> 50:45.580]  hit the print button and you would get this unbelievable 300 DPI output.
[50:45.580 --> 50:50.600]  And this was mind blowing. Like it's hard to convey how utterly mind blowing this was
[50:50.600 --> 50:54.760]  at the time. And I'm projecting because I was five years old, but by all accounts I
[50:54.760 --> 50:58.740]  should say it was mind blowing. Well, I didn't see, I don't know when I first saw a laser
[50:58.740 --> 51:07.920]  rider. It certainly wasn't 1985. I don't remember. It's interesting though because it was an
[51:07.920 --> 51:11.200]  integral piece. I think the ATP guys were talking about like the various heydays of
[51:11.200 --> 51:15.220]  Apple and one of the ones that that's, you know, naturally the Syracuse had picked four
[51:15.220 --> 51:20.600]  instead of picking one. But one of the ones he picked out was the, that sort of the birth
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.720]  of desktop publishing and when that became a real thing. And the laser rider was a critical
[51:24.720 --> 51:30.160]  piece of that. It was a really great example of Apple sort of giving birth to an industry
[51:30.160 --> 51:35.660]  by virtue of creating sort of a critical piece of hardware that made that industry possible.
[51:35.660 --> 51:39.720]  And the GUI and the Mac was a big part of it, but the fact you could instantly print
[51:39.720 --> 51:43.440]  it out and see what it looks like and make sure everything was right was a major part
[51:43.440 --> 51:49.400]  of it as well. And Apple had to make it themselves. Yeah. And it was even into the nineties, even
[51:49.400 --> 52:00.800]  into my time at the Drexel's student newspaper, the my beloved triangle. We would put the
[52:00.800 --> 52:06.240]  output together for the entire, it was like a tabloid sized newspaper and every page was
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.560]  put together from our laser rider output. Actually we had an HP by that time by the
[52:11.560 --> 52:16.120]  nineties, but we'd laser print the pages, put them together and then we'd have them
[52:16.120 --> 52:20.080]  on I forget what we, I forget the hell we called it. I can't believe I've forgotten,
[52:20.080 --> 52:23.680]  but it was like this sticky stuff that we'd put them on to put them on cardboard, you
[52:23.680 --> 52:28.360]  know, so it would be you know, we printed on nice paper, just regular paper though.
[52:28.360 --> 52:32.200]  And then you'd we had this like spray stuff. You had to do it in a special room because
[52:32.200 --> 52:36.680]  it was such a mess, but it was like, we had this room that was sort of like, instead of
[52:36.680 --> 52:40.080]  feeling like it was like a newspaper office, it was like a art room because it had that
[52:40.080 --> 52:46.720]  smell of like aerosol, sticky stuff. And you'd, you know, be very careful and nicely neatly
[52:46.720 --> 52:51.120]  press it. And then, you know, the last thing we do before we'd close for the week is, you
[52:51.120 --> 52:54.520]  know, like the editor in chief and a managing editor would sit there and look, read, read
[52:54.520 --> 52:58.640]  every page from corner to corner again, you know, make sure everything's right. And then
[52:58.640 --> 53:02.800]  a guy from the printer would come and pick up those boards. Like, so that's our, our
[53:02.800 --> 53:09.200]  delivery wasn't like a disc. It wasn't like a zip disc or a PDF or anything like that.
[53:09.200 --> 53:14.800]  It was laser printed output. And then they would just take it and it was photo ready.
[53:14.800 --> 53:17.960]  They'd, you know, I don't know what the hell they did, but you know, a couple hours later
[53:17.960 --> 53:22.640]  we'd have thousands of copies of an actual newspaper. But the fact that we are sell,
[53:22.640 --> 53:26.720]  I don't, I like, I remember asking, I remember at one point like asking like, what the hell
[53:26.720 --> 53:30.360]  did they do before this? And then like, you know, I kind of found out and I was like,
[53:30.360 --> 53:34.640]  I don't think I would have been in the newspaper before the laser writer. Like that was too
[53:34.640 --> 53:42.360]  much work. It was ridiculous. Yeah, I, my, I did the soon paper thing too. And, and we
[53:42.360 --> 53:46.880]  said that we still had that room where that was done, but it had since been, you know,
[53:46.880 --> 53:51.080]  it'd been retired. We were at that point, we were laying out in quark. We do use quark,
[53:51.080 --> 53:54.780]  but I mean, the output was paper, you know, we printed the pages. No, but, but, but we,
[53:54.780 --> 54:00.200]  we would put it out to PDF and then we could submit it over the internet to the printer.
[54:00.200 --> 54:04.940]  So it was, but, but it was like, it was still fresh enough to that era where that room was
[54:04.940 --> 54:09.300]  still there in the markup table or cut up table, whatever it's called was still in there.
[54:09.300 --> 54:14.320]  But it, but we don't, we were no longer using, I know what you're talking about, but I never
[54:14.320 --> 54:19.240]  actually, I never actually cut up a paper. Most of the ads we got, we got as paper, we'd
[54:19.240 --> 54:25.920]  get ads and they were paper and you know, we, we would scan them. It wasn't like we
[54:25.920 --> 54:29.360]  were, you know, we'd cut them out and paste them on the thing. We'd scan them at high
[54:29.360 --> 54:34.480]  resolution so we'd, you know, that we, we could have the whole, everything was in quark.
[54:34.480 --> 54:37.840]  But still that's how people delivered stuff to us because it wasn't, it was a wild, I
[54:37.840 --> 54:42.160]  mean, PDF, you know, sort of like in the time when PDF was starting to take off. But there
[54:42.160 --> 54:46.980]  just was no reliable interchange and you know, you'd send somebody an EPS file and God help
[54:46.980 --> 54:50.080]  them if they didn't have the right font, you know, it was just too hard.
[54:50.080 --> 54:55.360]  Yep. Oh yeah. Oh, we know we, we, we were still very much in the font, font headache
[54:55.360 --> 54:58.120]  phase for sure. Oh my God. It's like, what version of Futura
[54:58.120 --> 55:05.200]  do you have? Futura STD. Oh, STD. Nobody's using that anymore.
[55:05.200 --> 55:12.240]  Oh, that one spread like crazy. I thought, I was trying to think of a joke.
[55:12.240 --> 55:19.560]  I did, there was, there was a version of Futura called Futura that was Futura STD. But anyway,
[55:19.560 --> 55:23.920]  that was my take on airport a week ago where it's like, well, I kind of miss it. And in
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.000]  the way that I still kind of wish Apple made printers really just because I think they'd
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.240]  be better than the ones that you, you know, I think they would still be the best. But
[55:34.240 --> 55:38.720]  I get it. And you know, like I don't even, my house has been wired up with Eros, you
[55:38.720 --> 55:46.880]  know, for at least two years now. And our heart wasn't in it. And, you know you know,
[55:46.880 --> 55:51.520]  Gurman reported back in November, 2016 that they were no longer developing them. And so
[55:51.520 --> 55:55.360]  it's from then until now when they officially pulled the plug. But now that I think about
[55:55.360 --> 56:00.240]  it after a week and talking to, seeing a couple of other people's things, I think I agree
[56:00.240 --> 56:07.080]  with the Drang take in so far as why Apple created airport in the first place. Because
[56:07.080 --> 56:13.240]  in 1999 or 98, whenever that was, remember when Schiller jumped off the, in the demo,
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.720]  there was like a onstage demo where Phil Schiller jumped off like a 10 foot platform.
[56:17.720 --> 56:20.280]  Oh right. So it'd be, yes, it'd be disconnected. Yeah. So it was disconnected.
[56:20.280 --> 56:23.240]  Yeah. And to prove that it wasn't, that it wasn't connected to anything.
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.520]  Oh yeah. I remember, I remember having to decide whether you wanted to add an airport
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.800]  card or not to, to your laptop. Right. You had to add a card, but Apple made
[56:31.800 --> 56:37.000]  something that would, you know, they, they foresaw that wireless, you know, ethernet,
[56:37.000 --> 56:42.040]  you know, ethernet speeds over wireless, you know, was that's the future. You know, they're
[56:42.040 --> 56:45.680]  still pushing towards why a lot of, you know, getting a little, you know, still pushing
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.120]  towards wireless technologies today. But they saw that, you know, the wireless networking
[56:50.120 --> 56:54.280]  was the way of the future. Networking has always been hard to set up. And so if they
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.440]  did it all themselves, they could make it easy and they could, you know, make their
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.440]  own nice app for managing the base station, et cetera, and so forth. And that's not necessary
[57:03.440 --> 57:09.720]  anymore. But I think the difference with laser printers and airport today is, okay, there's
[57:09.720 --> 57:15.880]  other ways to easily set up a network today. And, you know, like Eros and other brands
[57:15.880 --> 57:18.320]  you don't have to go through. And frankly, for most people, it's, it's
[57:18.320 --> 57:22.840]  the one that their cable provider gives them, which, which are still crap, but they're,
[57:22.840 --> 57:26.800]  it's, they're less crappy than they used to be. And you know, if you don't think too much
[57:26.800 --> 57:32.760]  about it, it seems like it's, it's sufficient. Well, but I think the main reason that Apple,
[57:32.760 --> 57:39.240]  I wish Apple were still doing it is security and privacy. That I still, I trust Apple more
[57:39.240 --> 57:48.440]  and I certainly trust them more than the shit boxes you get from cable companies. And if
[57:48.440 --> 57:54.600]  you look, if you, you know, there's tons of, if you just start searching for security problems
[57:54.600 --> 58:00.280]  with like consumer grade wifi routers, they're all over the place. I mean, it's, it's really,
[58:00.280 --> 58:07.920]  really common. And I just think that with the renewed focus
[58:07.920 --> 58:11.960]  or not renewed, but the sort of the, just the way that the whole industry has gotten
[58:11.960 --> 58:18.480]  focused on security and privacy and encryption, et cetera, over the last 10 years, I feel
[58:18.480 --> 58:24.680]  like you know, not, not that I, you know, that it, it would take a renewed, what I'm
[58:24.680 --> 58:30.800]  talking about would take Apple to actually be interested and actively, you know making
[58:30.800 --> 58:38.080]  airport radically new and better than ever before. But I think they had a role to play
[58:38.080 --> 58:43.680]  there and they sort of abdicated it. Maybe. I mean, but I mean, honestly, what
[58:43.680 --> 58:51.320]  is your, if your ISP is, is problematic and tamping with your communications that like
[58:51.320 --> 58:56.040]  they can do that just as easily, you know, internally as opposed to using your modem.
[58:56.040 --> 58:59.720]  I mean, I'm not sure, or your router, I should say, I'm not sure how much of a difference
[58:59.720 --> 59:03.560]  that would make. And I guess I don't find that super compelling. What would I do find
[59:03.560 --> 59:09.320]  compelling and was, did you see that piece by M.G. Seigler? I think he called it Airports
[59:09.320 --> 59:15.360]  or something like that. But, but you know, his argument is that Apple should have moved
[59:15.360 --> 59:20.800]  to integrate sort of the router and air capability with the Apple TV and with, you know, sort
[59:20.800 --> 59:27.100]  of the HomePod or with, you know, a Siri sort of center in the house. And I think that is,
[59:27.100 --> 59:32.200]  I think that's where this is much more compelling and I think is a very strong argument to make.
[59:32.200 --> 59:36.320]  I mean, you can understand why Apple wanted to get out of it, not just because the solutions
[59:36.320 --> 59:40.600]  were good enough, but it actually does make it slightly more challenging to set it up
[59:40.600 --> 59:44.880]  initially because, you know, when the technician comes in and installs your internet, they
[59:44.880 --> 59:48.640]  have the expectation because 95% of their customers just use whatever they give them
[59:48.640 --> 59:52.360]  that they set it up and it's good to go. And if you want to add on a router, often you
[59:52.360 --> 59:55.600]  have to do like PPPoE or you have to do some sort of like configuration or if you set it
[59:55.600 --> 59:59.500]  up as a bridge mode, like there is, there are challenge. I think Apple might've been
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:04.080]  getting more, I bet part of the calculation was the amount of customer support they were
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.160]  having to do with people just trying to get these things set up with, with sort of like
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:13.160]  a wifi network that that was already being set up for them. And that probably went into
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.520]  it. But the payoff, the payoff of overcoming that complexity is you have a very sort of
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.520]  privileged position. It's, it's like the, the, the laser writer being compelling because
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.640]  it had networking built in, right? Cause HP actually came out with a laser printer first,
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.160]  but it didn't have networking. And the networking is what is what made the, the you know, the
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.040]  laser writers such a, so, so incredible as you just kind of just explained. And to have
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.160]  the same sort of thing when it comes to, you know, home automation, when it comes to TV,
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:45.980]  when it comes to music and streaming and all that sort of stuff, I think would be a very
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.040]  compelling place to be going forward. And so my take, I think it would be much more
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.200]  along the one that MG had where they're just kind of just kind of gave up on, on, on a
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.400]  great place to be and accepted being just another device in the network instead of sort
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]  of the device.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:07.000]  Yeah. And I completely agree. I'm glad you brought, I just added or you added MG's thing
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.280]  to the show notes. So it will be there. I completely agree. And you know, a good example
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.960]  of that where they started going down that path was with time capsule where it was more
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:20.440]  than just a router. It was also a destination where your max, all your max in your house
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:29.520]  could, could use for time machine. Cause time machine is a great feature, but it needs,
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:35.440]  it can't use, you know, for good reason, it can't use your startup drive as the place
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:43.960]  where it stores your backup information because that's what it's backing up. And I don't know
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:52.200]  if you're aware of this, an awful lot of people have a Mac books, not, they don't use desktop
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.200]  max.
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.560]  And so it's not really all that convenient to you have like a USB drive plugged into
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.280]  the side everywhere you go at all times so that time machine can run. So having time
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:11.240]  machine be able to back up to a network device like time capsule is a brilliant device for
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:17.320]  most Mac users because most Mac users are on Mac books. And even the ones who aren't,
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.760]  you know, having one device that everybody in the house can back up to is better than
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:28.160]  buying multi, you know, a USB drive for everybody. So that's just, and you know, now what are
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.400]  you supposed to do for time capsule if you're, if you're one of these people and that time
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  capsule is a great feature.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.200]  Well, the other thing is, you know, the, the, the trend in general has been towards you
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.760]  sort of mesh networks. You mentioned you have, you have a, a Euro. I have one of those hardcore
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:48.440]  sort of ubiquity systems like, like, like Marco has, but, but the, but, but the, what's
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:53.360]  so interesting is if, if Apple had been more sort of forward thinking about this, you know,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:00.640]  they could have used a mesh network and integrated that with a Siri type device like the, like
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.480]  the Amazon echo dots, the small ones. And imagine if those were both like, like a part
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:10.080]  of a wifi mesh network and also were sort of embedding Siri throughout the house. I
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.680]  mean, you know, this idea of like, like there was a real opportunity for sort of integrating
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.600]  all these sorts of different services, which is sort of Apple's bread and butter. And there
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.280]  was just, I think, I think it really was just a lack of vision. I mean, I've written about
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.600]  the thing with, you know, about the HomePod in Siri or the HomePod in general. I mean,
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.360]  the, remember the, the echo came out, I think it was in 2014 and I'm very proud of it because
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.640]  that was, it came out on the heels of the fire phone, which was, you know, just truly,
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:42.280]  it's honestly the worst phone I've ever used in my life. It was, it was truly horrendous.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.440]  And so they come out with this echo device and everyone's like, Oh, you know, the Amazon,
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.280]  what are they doing? They're terrible horrible. Well, what people didn't realize is the echo
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.440]  was not a hardware device. It was a conduit to us online service, which Amazon is much
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.760]  better at than, than they are sort of like a product that you hold in your hand. But
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.680]  and I was very, cause I was the only person I knew that first day is like, I think this
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.160]  is pretty compelling. It's going to be a big thing. And I think the problem for Apple and
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:12.980]  Google both was they were so dominant in smartphones that they couldn't imagine a world where the
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.480]  smartphone wasn't the most sort of important dominant device because why wouldn't it be?
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.120]  It's amazing. It's awesome. It's always with you. And it turns out, I probably said this
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.280]  in the show before cause I've made this point previously, but the one place where you're
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:30.200]  most likely to not have your phone happens to be when you're at home because you're charging
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:36.060]  it. Right. And, and, and, but Apple and Google, I think we're just so blind to it that Amazon
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.720]  got this multi-year headstart building this stuff out. And if you think about the timing,
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.400]  Apple stopped development into like when the current, the last version of the, of the airport
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.220]  came out and had it been around 2014 or so sometime around that, I'm just, I'm just guessing.
[01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.320]  But you know, if they had sort of not had this blind spot, you know, you could imagine
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.000]  a world where they have all these era like devices distributed through your house that
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.600]  have Siri all enabled and it's just, it's just sort of embedded in your house and it's
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.720]  combined with Apple TV and has this whole sort of like where, where the, the iPhone,
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.800]  you're less dependent on this device in your pocket and you're more sort of living in this
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.800]  sort of Apple controlled universe. And, but, but they didn't, they had that blind spot
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:22.360]  and now, and now they're, they're basically in many respects when it comes to the home
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.600]  back where they started. Yeah. And it's, think about how long ago that was that they had
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:32.320]  original, you know, they, they, they started shipping machines for the wifi in 1999. So
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.600]  it, you know, we're talking like 18 years. I think that's when their first airport came
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:40.920]  out, right? I, I am looking it up right now. It's close. It's gotta be close to around
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:46.040]  18 years. Like that's, yeah, they watched it in 19, they watched in 1999 and then the
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:53.960]  last version came out in well, 2011. Sheesh. It is, I think ultimately it's just, that's
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.440]  a, and it is sort of what I'm thinking. It's not just security and privacy, but it's just
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:05.460]  all of, there's just a lost opportunity, you know, to have 18 years of it and that it really
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:13.560]  only got better in that 18 years by adopting, you know, ever faster wifi standards and time
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.800]  capsule. Time capsule is the only thing they ever did along the lines of, Hey, if we've
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:24.920]  already got a device plugged in and networked and connected to the internet by definition,
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.360]  right? That that's the fundamental role that this thing plays. And you know, and they,
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:35.800]  before mesh networks, they had the airport express, which was right, which, which is
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:41.920]  kind of accomplished sort of the same thing. Like, and because their app, if you actually
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.700]  want to have multiple wifi devices in a house and you, you didn't know what you were doing,
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:51.080]  the only feasible way to do it was with, was with multiple Apple airport expresses because
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.840]  at least Apple had the app that made it somewhat approachable for, for a sort of regular person
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.120]  to set up. I guess I shouldn't say that time capsule is the only time they extended it
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:03.420]  because the airport express express is a good example too, where they had audio out from
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:09.920]  it and you could use that to you know, connect like a non networked audio, you know, like
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.280]  your stereo system to get, you know, to make it a destination for playing music from your
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280]  Mac.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]  Yeah, it was awesome.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:22.240]  It was awesome. I mean, you know, I mean, speaking of Paul, I mean like rogue amoeba,
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.720]  you know, made some amazing things that took advantage of that, you know, you know, in
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.160]  terms of audio. But that's another, you know, so like in the early years they were thinking
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:36.800]  of, Hey, you know, we've got these things, what else could we do with it? And it's like,
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.840]  you know, I'm sure that the way airport express came about was they were thinking, well, look,
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:44.880]  one base station, there's God, there's just no way in certain houses that we can make
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.120]  a signal strong enough to fill the whole house with wifi. What could we do? And I thought,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.160]  well, what if we sold, all right, we still sell a main base station, but we sell a cheaper,
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.780]  smaller thing that you could put another one like upstairs and it'll set up a secondary
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.600]  network that the same devices will automatically connect to.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.380]  You know, it's not a mesh network, but still sort of solving the same problem and mesh
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:11.400]  networks is like a, you know, years later, a better idea of do it. But if they had kept
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.400]  pressing forward, they should have gotten to mesh networks first and they could have
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:22.920]  kept thinking of more and more ideas. Cause ultimately the difference is in the early
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.320]  years in the two thousands, they couldn't make the, you know, these devices were more
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.920]  like traditional consumer electronic devices. Whereas all the stuff they've been doing in
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:39.120]  the last five, six years are making little devices that are actually iOS computers, right?
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:47.720]  Your AirPods are literally tiny little iOS computers running a system on a chip inside
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:57.880]  your ear. Apple TV is an iOS computer. You know, I'm sure I'm missing a couple, everything,
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:04.280]  almost everything they make now. HomePod is an iOS computer. What else could they do if
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.480]  they could make the router into a little iOS computer? Well, obviously, you know, the,
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.280]  like you said, you know, the, the Amazon Echo and Echo dots and stuff like that show you,
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:20.000]  you know, the direction you could go. It just, I don't know, it just seems like a missed
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.240]  opportunity. And I think you're very, very astute at that. They got blinded by the fact
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:31.360]  of, you know, that the, that the phone is your, what do you, you know, your everywhere
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:38.480]  computer. Sorry if you heard a vacuum in the background. I just stepped away there to stop
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.960]  that. But, sorry, I missed your last, like. Well, I just said, I just said, I think you're
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.920]  exactly right. The last I heard was you were talking about everything was an iOS computer
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.200]  and you were. Well, I was just listing some examples of it and everything, you know, that
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:54.360]  everything, but I think you're ultimately, you know, that they should have been thinking
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.160]  of that. And if they had been on top of it, you know, once they started making everything
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.680]  into iOS computers, boy, something like, you know, making, you know, Echos and Echo dots
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.960]  type devices would have been obvious if they hadn't been like, I think, and I think you're
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.200]  spot on blinded by the fact that they saw the iPhone as the computer that you would
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.640]  have everywhere. Yeah. And it's a perfect example that you see in company after company
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.520]  after company after company where you just almost it's impossible to not get blinded
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.760]  by your success. Right. And to and to and you see this again and again, like Microsoft
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:35.120]  could not imagine a world that did not have the PC at the center. Right. Right. You know,
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.160]  and it's the same sort of thing. Like and, you know, they could have still created a
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.360]  world where the iPhone was the most dominant piece in the center. What's interesting is
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.760]  Steve Jobs. You know, if you remember, his last keynote was about iCloud being the new
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.720]  center of your life. But the reality is, is that never actually happened. Like the truth
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:59.040]  is the iPhone has become ever more the sort of for practical purposes, the center of your
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.080]  life. And it's the center of your life in terms of the way Apple thinks about their
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.280]  business where, you know, they're going to get you buy a morph of iPhone. They're going
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.800]  to get you to do more things on the iPhone or more services. They're going to sell you
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:15.360]  AirPods. They're going to sell you a watch, all of which sync with the iPhone. And and
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.240]  I don't on one hand, like I fault them because they got this wrong. On the other hand, it's
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.240]  sort of like, well, that's the way that's the way it works. Like even Apple, as as well
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.140]  run as they have traditionally been, are not sort of immune to the mistakes that befall
[01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:34.600]  every single successful company. So I think this is and this is an example of that. Let
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:41.320]  me take a break here and thank our next sponsor to our good friends at RX bar. RX bar makes
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:49.000]  little food bars and 11 delicious flavor varieties. They're gluten free, soy free, dairy free.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Very important in the Gruber household. No added sugar. So it's not like they're candy
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.840]  bars and they're just calling them breakfast bars or, you know, energy bars or something
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.560]  like that. Because a lot of if you ever look at the ingredients on a lot of these bars
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.760]  and I'm not opposed to a candy bar personally. I'm just saying, though, if you're really
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.720]  kind of passing it off as a quick breakfast on the go, you know, take a look at the ingredients
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.680]  where they don't add any sugar. They don't add artificial colors, preservatives, fillers.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:21.320]  It's real food. Their core ingredients do all the talking. It's simply it's like eating
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:27.240]  three egg whites, two dates, six almonds with no B.S. Real food ingredients actually taste
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.680]  really good. I like the taste of these things. It really is good. And you can actually taste
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.800]  the ingredients like the ones that have fruit. You can taste the fruit. The ones that have
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:41.520]  spices like sea salt. I actually like I do like the ones with salt. I think like I just
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:47.240]  always like salty food, but you can taste it. So whether you like sweet or savory, chocolate
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.600]  or fruit flavors, there's an RX bar for you. And they really are convenient. You just you
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.520]  know, it's eating a bar. You open the thing up, you eat it. I think I said this the last
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.120]  time that they sponsored the show. I had one thing I'd gone through my whole life and hadn't
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.580]  really known. I don't think I ever ate before. And I think I got turned off because of Raiders
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:10.040]  of the Lost Ark are dates. I don't remember the scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:17.320]  the monkey eats the date. Well, I got turned off on it, but it turns out dates are delicious.
[01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.200]  And that's what they use to bind these things together. They've got nuts for texture, dates
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.860]  to bind them, egg whites, real egg whites for protein. And they're just fantastic for
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.960]  a number of occasions. Breakfast on the go, a snack at the office, keep one in your bag
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.280]  for the plane. You seriously eat something like this on the plane instead of eating the
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:42.160]  garbage food that they sell you on the plane. Some kind of energy, you know, like if you're
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:47.060]  going on a long bike ride or hike or something like that. It's so super convenient. And these
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:54.400]  RX bars, they really do taste good. They taste good. They're healthy. They have all the real
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.840]  ingredients like protein, stuff like that. So here's what you do if you want to get involved
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.200]  with these RX bars. I recommend them. I really do. They're good. They're so easy. They really
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:10.760]  are convenient and they taste good. So here's what you do. And it's a special offer for

[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.040]  you this personally, I can't say I tried all 11 flavors cause there's some that I'd really
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:42.160]  thought, I don't think I liked that. Every single one that I tried tastes about what
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.160]  I thought it would taste like. It, you know, it, it, it's, it's, so if you look at the
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.520]  ingredient, if you just go to the website, when it comes to energy bars, that's all you
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:59.400]  can ask. So my thanks to RX bar for sponsoring the show. All right. You still there Ben?
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:08.320]  I'm here. I am here. I, I, I, I successfully took the dog to the restroom. You're multitasking.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.920]  I am multitasking. Apple's quarterly results. I don't know if I want to spend a lot of time
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:20.600]  on this, but, uh, we have to talk about this, uh, Samsung OLED thing. There was a lot of
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:27.160]  pessimism about Apple's, the iPhone 10 results or iPhone 10 sales. And it's, I think it's
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.600]  a couple of factors. I think one of them is that every, I think it's every year in this
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.840]  quarter. I think cause the, the, the, the holiday quarter, the one that ends in December
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.200]  is all about the new phones and the new phones are so much excitement, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:45.440]  And then the March quarter, January, February, March, I think on an annual basis, there's
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.440]  a, there's just a, you can just set your clock to it next year, starting around January,
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.200]  February, there's going to be reports that the new iPhones from September, 2019, uh,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.000]  especially the flashiest ones are a disappointment. Sales are down. Suppliers of certain things
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.660]  are saying that Apple has slashed, uh, their, their estimated orders. No, there's, there's
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.480]  a good reason for that though. And that was because, uh, two years ago, the second quarter
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:20.680]  of 2016 is where the bottom fell out of the iPhone success. And, and like that in a real
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:26.760]  meaningful way, not only were sales down 16% year over year, which was the first time iPhone
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.080]  sales I think had been down ever year over year, but also it was actually far worse than
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:36.480]  it appeared because Apple built up a huge amount of inventory to the point that it takes
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:42.880]  on a 2 billion right down later that year. So like quarter to 2016 was a complete disaster
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:48.520]  for Apple, for its suppliers, for its, um, you know, for anyone who held the stock at
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.000]  that time. So I think like it's only been one year or two years since then. So I, I
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.020]  think there was more going on than just like, there's a reason for this quarter to, to be
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:04.160]  a little nerve wracking. Again, and the other thing was in the last quarter, there was some
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.720]  inventory questions again, which made, which kind of like gave some hints that is there,
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.680]  is there going to be a similar sort of thing to 2016? So I think it's, it's a little more
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.060]  justified than sort of just a, a, a usual, you know, Apple, Apple's doom sort of narrative
[01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.060]  sort of thing.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:30.680]  All right. Fair enough. Um, and I, even I published a piece a week or so ago saying
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.520]  maybe there is something to this linking to a Bloomberg report on Samsung's result where
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:42.120]  Samsung said, Hey, you know, we're seeing slot significantly less, uh, uh, business
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:47.960]  in our flexible OLED displays than, than we expected. And that's, is this where, is this
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.000]  where I, is this where I throw myself, throw myself on the story? Well, it was, cause you,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.200]  it was, I won't do it. I won't do it. It was probably do it. It was, you had, you had posted
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.940]  a post that saying that someone was a jackass was saying that iPhone X sales were down.
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.640]  And I said, I don't know, I think I'm a little worried about the iPhone X. And then, uh,
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.440]  and then a few hours later that article dropped and I, I for, I'm the one that forwarded you
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.600]  that article and said, uh, yes, look at, look at here. And then you posted and then, and
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.600]  then I woke up the day after earnings and I, and I sent you an apology message. There's
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.360]  this story. I did. It's not like, well, you sent me the link and you send me a link and
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.120]  then I go post it to during fireball, but you sent me the link and you had said, I don't
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.220]  know, I think there's something to it and I trust your opinion. I had seen this story
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.860]  before and I just didn't link to it. I was like, ah, and you made me look at it again
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:37.240]  and I read it and I thought, Hmm. And what I, my regret isn't that I linked to it. My
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:44.920]  regret is that is the exact language I used and I, I'm not going to go back and edit it
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.360]  because I think it would be, you know, it's disingenuous, but I'll tell you what I wish
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:56.860]  I had written. What I wrote was, let's see here under the headline, Samsung scenes sees
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:03.200]  slow demand for OLEDs used for Apple's iPhone 10. Well, I regret that headline. I should've
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.000]  just said they see slow demand for flexible OLEDs because that used for Apple's iPhone
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.480]  10 makes it sound like they're only used for the iPhone 10 and they're not, even though
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.880]  they're very expensive displays and therefore aren't used for most phones. But my first
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.920]  sentence after quoting from the Bloomberg article was starting to sound like iPhone
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:30.120]  10 sales really are falling short of expectations. And I wish instead of the verb are I had said
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.160]  might be because that's really what I was thinking. And I think it would have held up
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:41.560]  better a week later. And so here's the thing though. So here's the thing. I mean, so one,
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.480]  the, I think it's a little more complicated though than Bloomberg got it wrong and, and
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.400]  everyone else got it right. Because I actually, the truth is actually I think in the middle
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:57.720]  because I think what happened was Bloomberg really kind of ran with this. Like it's going
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.200]  to be a big problem, blah, blah, blah. And then you had all this sort of spillover articles
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.920]  saying it's going to be terrible. It's going to be awful, blah, blah. And then it comes
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.400]  out and it's fine. It's the, it's the best selling phone every week. And I was like,
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:13.680]  ah, you were wrong. But that also is not totally right either. Like there was a, you know,
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:19.480]  there was a drop off. Like last year, the, the average selling price, it always drops
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.200]  after the first quarter because the first quarter when all the enthusiasts buy the phone,
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:27.480]  they always buy the best possible phone they can. And the last year the drop off was 6%
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.960]  and that was pretty normal. The year before it was 7%. The year before it was 4%. So like
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.080]  that, that's kind of a, it's normal for average selling price to go down. This last quarter
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:42.040]  went down 9%, which means there was for sure, there was for sure is a, a more of a drop
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:47.000]  off from the high end than there has been in previous quarters. Now, was it a disaster?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000]  Of course not. It wasn't even close to being a disaster, but, but it was, you know, and
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.400]  there's this quote that Cook had where he's like, yeah, maybe you'd like to win the Super
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.840]  Bowl by more points, but you still won the Super Bowl. It's a great phone. Like that
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.640]  sure sounds like Tim Cook saying, well, we thought we could have done more, but we still
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.360]  did pretty, pretty good. Which means, which means your quote was right. It was short of
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.320]  expectations, but it was not a disaster. No, I don't know about expectations. I think
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:16.600]  maybe short of hopes, right? Like realistic hopes, you know what I mean? I think it was
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.320]  exactly within expectations. And in the other side, and I think you're right that, that
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:26.360]  the drop off quarter to quarter, in other words, going from the first two months, cause
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:33.240]  it wasn't on sale for the whole quarter in, uh, uh, the holiday quarter, right? The iPhone
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:36.640]  10 was right, but all we can look at is the whole quarter though. That's, that's the,
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:39.960]  that's the most information, but I actually think that's kind of interesting because it
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:44.440]  was only available for two months in that quarter. And it, it's so clear that so many
[01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.040]  of the people who wanted to get an iPhone 10 right away, bought it right away that even
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.560]  though it was only available for two months in that quarter, it still was a bigger drop
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:59.560]  off quarter to quarter, you know, from, from, uh, the December quarter to the March quarter,
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.560]  then the, then like you said, then the last two or three years, it was still, it's really
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.300]  weird because it was the other thing that's weird is they were in supply demand balance
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:13.160]  or something or close to it by the end of the quarter. And that was also, that was the
[01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.760]  other big warning sign for the iPhone 10 is usually when Apple launches a new phone, uh,
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.220]  the most successful ones by the end of the quarter, there's still not what they call
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:24.760]  supply demand balance where, where, where like they're selling more than they can make.
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.720]  And the problem was the iPhone 10 within literally like five weeks was already in balance. So
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:33.440]  there was a lot, so even last quarter, and I think I wrote this after last quarter, like
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:38.180]  I was very worried about this current quarter because wow, if they're already in supply
[01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:43.600]  demand balance and like how many, how much more demand is there for the device? So I
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.320]  will say from my perspective, it did better than I expected because I was worried about
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:54.360]  that specific point from last quarter. Uh, but that said, uh, you know, it's still, there
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:59.660]  was still a, it's not, you can't say it was a, there was a drop off. It just, you know,
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:04.840]  it was so oversold and overhyped, uh, you know, by I think Bloomberg in particular.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.200]  But it's had a profound effect on, on the average selling price of iPhones because even
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.600]  with that drop off from the last quarter, if you look at the year over year, January,
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.000]  February, March of last year and January, February, March this year, the average selling
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.080]  price went to, I'm, I don't have notes, I'm doing this from my memory yesterday, but I
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:30.480]  think it went from 659 average selling price to 729, uh, something. Uh, that is, that is
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:35.800]  pretty good. It went from 656 to 729. All right. Uh, so at 11, 11% increase, which is,
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.060]  yeah, which is, which is huge. I mean that the last year, the year over year increase
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:44.440]  was, was 2% for a 10 year old product for a 10 year old product to all of a sudden have
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:50.800]  an average selling price increase, you know, in an industry where as is, you know, three
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.640]  or four years ago, everybody thought that the average selling price for everything iPhone
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.500]  included was going to sink, you know, that it was going to, uh, and who knows, it still
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:04.520]  may happen eventually. I mean, you know, in long enough run, it's probably going to happen,
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.880]  you know, but, uh, you know, the way that the PCs, PCs constantly got cheaper, like
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:17.400]  the average selling price of PCs didn't go up 10 years into the PC revolution. Like PCs
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.680]  used to cost like, you know, six, $7,000 and they, you know, now they cost like $200. Um,
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.920]  no, you're, you're hitting the exact right point. Like no matter, it's so easy. It's
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.060]  stuck in the weeds of like, where is it? Relatively speaking, if you just step back for a moment,
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.160]  the iPhone 10 is an unbelievable triumph. I mean, from a financial and business perspective.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.200]  I mean, we are 10 years into smartphones, 11 years into smartphones and Apple, I kind
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.880]  of wrote about this week, like when I first started to tech, it was 2013 when the five,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.360]  I got a wrote about the iPhone five C so much, right? Cause it was such, it was this huge
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.320]  deal. Apple has to release a cheaper phone. Here we are five years later and Apple has
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:03.080]  jacked up the price of the highest end iPhone by what? 33% and they're selling gobs of them.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:08.200]  I mean, yes, we can quibble about the relative amount of those gobs, but the factor means
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.480]  that they are absolutely defying gravity in a way that, that if you didn't really think
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.720]  about how Apple works and why they could accomplish that would seem totally preposterous. Yeah.
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:23.200]  Yeah. That's it. It was, I noted that in your daily update today that that was a great callback
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:28.080]  to the five C, which was just a couple of years ago. But yes, the five C was seen as
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:34.200]  a big WTF by the industry because you know, the rumors had linked that they're making
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:41.160]  a phone, it'll be plastic instead of metal. And everybody quote unquote, everybody assumed
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.960]  that Apple had to make a quote cheap iPhone. So obviously the plastic one would be the
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.140]  cheap one. And so it's going to have some kind of, you know, the most exciting thing
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:54.400]  about it is going to be this exciting low price point. And it came out at exactly, like
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.360]  you point out, exactly the price that they would have had if they had just kept the original
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.360]  iPhone five around for another year. Which little birdie say was really hard to manufacture
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.000]  and very high return rates. And there was a very good reason to retire it. Right. And
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.760]  had, you know, had an anodization problems that customers weren't happy with, you know,
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:22.000]  the black you know, if you recall the iPhone five had a black variant and the, and the
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  those chamfered edges and the iPhone five S went to space gray, I think, and it was
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.520]  a much lighter dark darkening to the aluminum. It wasn't really that dark at all. It was,
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.720]  yeah, it was true. No, the, the, in the five, I, I, I believe I had a black one. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.320]  It was amazing when you bought it and looked like absolute garbage with it. But I kind
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:48.400]  of liked that. You would get that chipping and stuff on it. I like it. I agree. I agree.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:53.120]  I don't placate, like I like the sort of like beaten weathered look, so I don't mind it.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:59.240]  But uh, I know that some people don't though, especially with their $700 iPhones that they're
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.400]  hoping to resell eventually. So yes, there were problems with it. But anyway, it's a
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.840]  good con it's a, it's such a good, like it, you know, from there to here difference where
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.240]  everybody was, you know, expected Apple to make a cheap phone and they didn't and they
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:20.240]  thought it was a mistake. And now they've made a more expensive phone than ever. And
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.800]  it's, you know, it's maybe not the biggest hit it possibly could have been, but it's
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:31.800]  clearly selling well enough that it is significantly altered the average selling price of an iPhone.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.520]  Right. And I mean, Apple, to be fair, Apple did raise the price of the iPhone eight and
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.520]  eight plus compared to, compared to the seven and seven plus when they were brand new a
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:47.040]  year ago. Right, exactly. Uh, so, but that kind of makes the point even further, right?
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.680]  They're also raising their, their second tier phone prices and it, and it's not, it doesn't
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:55.000]  really matter. I mean, and the other thing is, you know, yes, unit sales have flattened
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.080]  and people are right to point that out. But you know, I think there's an, there's a difference
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:04.420]  and this is something that people just have, have, you know, there's a difference between
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:07.760]  saying Apple has saturated and this is why the phone marks so great. Apple, I think it's
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.240]  fair to say Apple has largely saturated the sort of the high end phone market and to the
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:15.880]  extent they pick up new users, they're, they are, they have always picked up switchers
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:21.160]  because people are far, like Apple customers almost always buy iPhone customers almost
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.080]  always buy new iPhones. Whereas the average Android purchaser, their likelihood of buying
[01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:28.960]  the same phone is, is significantly lower. So if you just work out the math, by definition,
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:32.680]  Apple's going to be picking up switchers over time, but that's counterbalanced by the fact
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.560]  people do hold onto their phones longer than they used to. Right. But at the end of the
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:40.720]  day, phones wear out, they, they break, they get old and people, they're, they're personal
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:44.380]  accessories that people carry with them. They want to have the hot new thing. And so that
[01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:49.520]  makes us such a great market to be in because sure, there, there may be a limit to how large
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:55.040]  Apple can grow as far as their base and they may be close to it, but they're not losing
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.760]  anyone. And this is the, you know, this is the, when I first started to techery and you
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.760]  know, very much into things like disruption and, and sort of business theory and stuff
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:08.160]  like that. And, and, you know, I was so sure that there, there was something wrong there
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.840]  because you remember there was all the predictions. Apple is going to be disrupted and the low
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.160]  price competitors come along. And, and, you know, that was one of the reasons I wanted
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.200]  to search checkery is, you know, obviously you and other folks were writing that this
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.480]  makes no sense, but you know, for me coming from the sort of business theoretical perspective,
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.280]  I wanted to put sort of like the theory around why it doesn't make sense. And, and and a
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.400]  big thing there was, you know, all these analysis, we're all taking examples from like the enterprise
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.080]  market, right? Where yes, you come in and you buy, you sell something cheaper that has
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:42.200]  the same features and you can convince the CIO to buy it and he doesn't care how it works.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.640]  Like someone else has to actually deal with it, but the consumer market is totally different.
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.740]  Like people like nice things and it's so bizarre because you look at basically every other
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:55.320]  category of products people buy and there are successful products at the high end. It's
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:00.480]  not like, it's not like luxury bags get disrupted or nice clothes get disrupted or nice shoes
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.040]  get disrupted. No, they continue to sell and will always sell because people like nice
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:09.320]  things and why that shouldn't apply to your phone does, doesn't make any sense.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:18.480]  And isn't one of Clayton Christensen, one of his examples from his theory is like steel
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:25.480]  suppliers and how like the big, you know, like US steel got like undercut by like, you
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:30.480]  know, micro mini, mini, mini mills. Yeah. Uh, great example. And it's, you know, and
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.920]  I think he's, I think he's, I, you know, I've read it and I, it's like, I'm nodding my head
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.340]  and it's, you know, a little bit outside my wheelhouse, but I'm like, this makes a lot
[01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:44.040]  of sense. I agree with this, but you know, uh, the way that a manufacturer who buys raw
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:49.120]  steel evaluates who they're going to buy the raw steel from is very different than the
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:57.560]  way that individual people buy their personal, the things they use in their personal life.
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:01.920]  You know, I made a list somewhere of all the industries that Christiansen uses examples
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.080]  and they were all like airlines and like all these sorts of things. Like they were all
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.480]  business to business businesses where there was a buyer buying a product for like a fleet
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.640]  of people or whatever. And, and they're, they were not the user of the product. And so they,
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.120]  they weren't going to care about these sort of like consumer user experience. And the
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:24.320]  other thing I know at the time, there were actually lots of other examples of products
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.080]  where people did care where the buyer was user things like game consoles, things like,
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:32.680]  uh, like clothes and accessories. I just talked about a moment ago, things like cars, you
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.200]  know, everyone's always used cars as an analogy for why Apple would succeed. And it's a totally
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.400]  legitimate analogy, right? Because people buy nice cars. Does everyone buy nice cars?
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:47.200]  Can BMW take over the entire market and selling high priced cars? No, they can't. But, but
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:52.800]  can they sell like, are they going to be disrupted because Chevy comes out with something cheap?
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.880]  No, they're not. The second most successful retailer, I don't know if it's worldwide,
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:02.520]  but certainly in the United States a year after year. Uh, and they've been around for
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:08.420]  a while, uh, by square footage, second dollars or, you know, profit by square footage of
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:13.720]  retail space is Tiffany and company. And you can go in there and you, you know, if you've
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.920]  ever bought a diamond and you get like the color and the clarity and the cut and the
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:26.040]  grade and the certified and you, you can buy a cheaper diamond ring, uh, probably at any,
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:33.760]  almost any other store. Uh, uh, and Tiffany, you know, is the second most profitable retailer
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.520]  in, in the world, uh, by square foot. Yeah. And not just, not just that, but, but like
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:44.240]  even there you can buy the same quality jewelry for much cheaper or somewhere else. So it's
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.720]  not just a matter of it being jewelry. Like you're paying more for the Tiffany brand,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:53.520]  but brands work. But you also get, it's more than just the brand. No, you also get, and
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.680]  I can vouch for this firsthand, you get, you get some of the best, uh, customer experience
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:04.760]  you'll, you'll get anywhere in the world in terms. Oh, absolutely. And, and how does that,
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:08.480]  and people just like people thinking about this in such black and white terms and putting
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:12.520]  on a spreadsheet, like that stuff matters. Like, I mean, one thing I learned when I started
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:17.160]  flying a lot, for example, and I remember when I first got like United one K or where,
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:21.760]  you know, and like, yeah, it's great. I really wanted to get it cause I get all the upgrades,
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.480]  right? And you get like, you know, six international upgrades or something like that, which is
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.000]  a huge deal. But I realized actually the upgrades aren't that big of a deal. It's the fact that
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.840]  I can pick up a phone and dial a number and a human picks up immediately. And like, I
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:36.120]  remember I was in Korea one time and something happened with my flight and I just dial the
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.280]  number, pick it up and boom, it was all fixed for me in like 10 minutes. And like, like
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.320]  that is worth so much at the time. My whole family was with me and that, that was worth
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.920]  a hundred upgrades, right? That's what, that's what actually matters when it comes to these
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.320]  sorts of experiences. Oh, I found the, I found the list, by the way, the original article,
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.060]  the original disruption article looked at disc drives, PCs, mortgage banking, microprocessors
[01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:05.400]  and software. And I think it's, and also like air, visual aircraft, medical devices, things
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.640]  like that. I think it's interesting that PCs is in there because I think, have we talked
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.620]  about this on this podcast? I certainly talked about on mine that the, so much bad analysis
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:21.120]  and technology comes from people that don't actually understand what happened in the PC
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.920]  industry in the eighties. And like people have this vision of Apple being this sort
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:29.360]  of dominant force than Microsoft coming along and disrupting them by being open and closed.
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.560]  And it's just utter, it's, it could not be more wrong. Like Microsoft, the IBM PC came
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:41.800]  out first in 1981 and did have a windows GUI. No, it had, you know, it had a text based
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.440]  operating system. But the point of windows coming along was windows was backwards compatible
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.560]  with DOS. And so DOS built up a huge user base, built up a huge amount of software,
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.400]  built up developers, the entire ecosystem before the Mac even launched. Like the Mac
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:02.480]  never had a chance relative to, to IBM PCs. And, and it turned out that adding a windows
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:06.760]  GUI was, it was a feature. Like it was a, like obviously it was a feature that changed
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:11.720]  the world, but it was still a feature. It didn't change the way the business model worked.
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.400]  And to say that Apple lost because they were closed and Microsoft is open is to utterly
[01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.680]  miss the point. And not only it's so damaging, not just because it misses the point, but
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:27.600]  also the only reason Apple succeeded was because they were closed. If like when Apple actually
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.400]  opened up in the nineties, it almost killed the company. Like being closed made him a
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:35.200]  viable company in the midst of sort of the Microsoft dominance.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.040]  I think you would agree with this. I've written, you know, we both, this is a topic we've both
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.120]  written about and I love it, but, and it, and it, and it's so, doesn't matter how much
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.680]  we write, we could write about it every day for the rest of the world. And it's not going
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:49.000]  to change the perception of everybody who, who, there's no way you're going to shake
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.560]  people off that open and closed argument. But the one thing that I believe firmly was
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:36:00.240]  that, and, and me personally, I was, I've all, I, to this day, I'm repulsed by windows.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.560]  But especially in the, in like the late eighties and there throughout the whole nineties, I
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:09.360]  thought windows 95 was garbage. I agreed it looked better than windows three, one, but
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.640]  I still didn't think it looked good. And, and just the way that it was, you know, built
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:20.120]  off DOS and you still had like a stupid C drive and all the ridiculous file name restrictions,
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:24.920]  blah, blah. I mean, the thousand thousand things that were ungodly because of the way
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:31.480]  that it was built off DOS. But I also firmly believe that business wise, if windows like
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.440]  to make windows actually be good, it couldn't have been built on top of DOS. It would have
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:42.020]  needed to have been an all new operating system. And if they had done that and done a graceful
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:47.640]  job and made something like, let's say that was at least as elegant and self-contained
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.840]  as the Macintosh, I don't think it would have, I think it would have failed because it was
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:37:03.200]  the fact that windows built on top of DOS that, that made it palatable to like the people
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.320]  in it. Cause I remember the time that the mentality of the people who I knew who were
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:13.000]  PC enthusiasts and would be the type of people who would be making these decisions at a business
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.960]  or a company is they might think, well, this is great because you know, these people who
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:22.920]  are confused by DOS, they can run windows and they can get this gooey thing, but I'm
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.900]  not, you know, their machines still booted into DOS and they only ran windows when they
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.880]  typed win at the command prompt. You know, they didn't have their machine set up to boot
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.400]  into windows. Their machines booted into DOS because they were quote unquote real computer
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.480]  users. And if they would have had to buy a different machine and run an incompatible
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.840]  operating system to get the gooey, they wouldn't, they wouldn't have bought into it. It was
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:49.720]  the whole reason they, they scoffed at the Mac.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:55.600]  Yeah, it was your, one, you're completely right. Two, the other thing is, you know,
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.220]  there was lots of software written for DOS and it needed to be able to run and I would
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:06.080]  go further than you. It's not just that it would have failed because, but the, it would
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.100]  have failed because Microsoft was fundamentally unsuited to write a graceful, beautiful computer
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:17.880]  that was easy to use. And that's not at all a criticism. I mean the foundation of Microsoft
[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:22.960]  is responding and hustling to give consumers exactly what they want. I mean like Bill Gates
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:27.480]  and Paul Allen started the company in New Mexico because they, they won, basically someone
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:31.160]  wanted to write a basic compiler and they said, oh, we got one, we'll write it. And
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.000]  then they said, okay, you give it to us. And they hadn't written it yet. They had to go,
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.880]  they had to go and write it. And same thing with IBM. Microsoft won the IBM contract for
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:44.520]  an operating system without having an operating system. They actually bought DOS from a company
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:49.320]  called like Seattle Computer Company or something like that, renamed it to MS-DOS and then gave
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.160]  it to IBM. Like, and again, it's easy to sit here from a product perspective and an Apple
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.160]  perspective and criticize that and mock it. You know what, there are all kinds of ways
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:02.000]  to build companies and Microsoft from the beginning has given customers exactly what
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.240]  they want for better or worse. And, and they have made a whole lot of money doing it and
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.240]  enabled a whole lot of things and, and implied in that is, you know, you're going to layer
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.600]  a GUI on top of a operating system that you bought from someone else and is a mishmash
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.800]  and stuff and it's going to be clunky and hard to use, but you know what, it got the
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:25.120]  job done. And, and you know, Mike, this is the mistake, huge mistake they made with the
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:28.320]  phone. They just wanted to come and be like, oh yeah, we're going to compete with Apple
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:35.120]  on the user experience. No, you're not. You have 30 years of papering over glommed together
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.640]  as crap because it's what the customer wants. You're not going to suddenly develop the skills
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:45.640]  and mentality to build a beautiful, easy to use operating system. Right. I mean, it blows
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:51.240]  my mind that windows phone had far worse support for enterprise features and the iPhone did
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:54.560]  from the day it launched until the day it went out of business. Like it's like they
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.560]  were crazy. They totally forgot. And this was Balmer's, one of his biggest mistakes.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.760]  I mean, he had a whole bunch of them, but just, he completely forgot. He got so wrapped
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.920]  up in Microsoft being big and powerful and completely forgot the nature of the company
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:10.600]  and what they were actually good at. And, and to the extent that Adala has been successful,
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:16.600]  he's been phenomenally successful. It's been in going back to and embracing that Microsoft,
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:19.360]  what they are good at. And you know what, they go to enterprise customers like we will
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.520]  help you. We'll go to the cloud with you have a hybrid environment. You can run some of
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:25.280]  your stuff on your on-premise or you're running some of your stuff in the cloud and it's gonna
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.440]  be a big mess and it's gonna be messy, but we'll be messy together. And, and they're
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.840]  being extremely successful doing it cause that's what Microsoft does. And anyhow, sorry,
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:38.000]  that was a rant, but I, I completely agree with you that if Microsoft tried to compete
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:42.760]  with a Mac, like in a user experience perspective, they would have failed completely for all
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760]  kinds of reasons.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:51.080]  Yeah. I think that complaining about Microsoft, especially Gates, Bill Gates era of Microsoft,
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:59.000]  not being, not producing elegant Mac caliber elegance, intuitive software would be like
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  complaining that, you know, you just went in the butcher shop and the guy, here's a
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.680]  guy who's supposed to be a professional and is, he's wearing a smock covered with blood.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:11.520]  You know, it's like, uh, that's not who they are. You know what I mean? Like Microsoft
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.480]  is the butcher. It was, you know, is to get their hands are dirty and their, their workclothes
[01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.900]  are covered with blood. Uh, you know, and they got the job done. Right.
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:24.600]  And then them, you know, trying to make windows phone was them like, you know, after doing
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.560]  that, that's their expertise. That's who they are. And then they're like, I'm going to be
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:33.660]  on the cover of GQ and it's like, no, you're not, you are not suddenly going to become
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.240]  a sharp snappy dresser.
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:40.280]  Right. And that's the thing with Apple, like Apple, Apple, the key, the key to Apple coming
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:47.320]  back is not, is not Steve Jobs genius directly. What was key was the shift in the market to
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:52.680]  the consumer market because the thing is jobs was always a consumer. So Mac was a consumer
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.000]  product. The problem is the Mac was a consumer product in a world where only businesses bought
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.120]  computers and the big difference for the iPhone relative to the Mac is not open versus closed.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:08.200]  It's that by 2007 the consumer market mattered far more than the business market was far
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.240]  larger and, and Apple had always been the right company for that market. They were just,
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:15.240]  you know, 30 years too early.
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.240]  I agree completely. I don't know if we've talked about this before, but I, I love talking
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:28.720]  about this. I agree completely. And I think even Steve Jobs himself overlooked that aspect
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:38.840]  and if you know that, that, you know, and I think that that's why the Mac in the first
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:44.120]  two years was sort of problematic for Apple because it wasn't a failure, but it wasn't
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:49.480]  the success that they had envisioned. And I think that that the success they'd envisioned
[01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:56.160]  was that they themselves knew how amazing it was both compared to everything else on
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.840]  the market and just in and of itself how successful they were at the hardware, at the, at the
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:07.400]  software, just everything about it. That they were, you know, I think they were blinded
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.320]  by how can, you know, and even the slogan, the computer for the rest of us, there was
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.800]  no rest of us. There was nothing for them to do. It was, it would have been the computer
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:24.560]  and, and the, the, the things that were good about the Mac in 1984 are, if you just pick
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:31.080]  out a bunch of adjectives there, those, I would wager that 98% of those adjectives apply
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:38.400]  to the iPhone in 2007. Like they're all the things that made, you know, the kindred spirits,
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:45.520]  same cultural DNA, same priorities. It's just that the difference, the difference wasn't
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.160]  that one was more elegant or more ahead of the competition, you know, years ahead of
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:58.040]  the competition and sweated more details and more, you know, pixel by pixel precision of
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:03.160]  how far away should these things, things be and all of that. They're both were the same
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:07.000]  way. The difference wasn't that one was better than the other. The difference was that in
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.840]  2007 there was a tremendous reason for anybody and everybody to want to have an iPhone and
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:16.840]  there were things they would find it very useful for every single day and in 1984 that
[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:21.200]  just wasn't true of a personal computer.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:28.000]  It's spot on. It really is the case, you know, the Mac versus Windows really is like the
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.720]  iPhone versus Android in every respect. It's the same in terms of market share. I mean
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:37.600]  the iPhone is a little bigger than the Mac, you know, even today, but it's still only
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.280]  like 10 or 12% worldwide. It's really quite small relative to Android and it's the same
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.760]  from the user experience. Windows has some nice features. Android has some nice features.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.760]  I've used both. I've worked at Microsoft. I use it every day. I would be, you know,
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:53.240]  I've said before I'd actually be fine using Windows every day. It's the third party
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.600]  app system that is the problem, which kind of blows people's mind because they associate
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:06.880]  apps being with Windows, but it's the details. It's the ease of use. It's the scrolling.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.360]  It's all the stuff that you can't put on a spreadsheet and you can't measure and you
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.280]  can't put in your sort of calculation about, oh, it's now good enough, so what's going
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:21.520]  to matter now is price because people can feel it and use it and that matters. Again,
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:25.440]  it matters when the buyer is the user, which is the case in the consumer market and Apple
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.120]  has just found the right market.
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:36.640]  I think in hindsight, too, it's exactly why the entirety of the existence of NeXT was
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:42.780]  effectively just an exile. They were just lost in the weeds in terms of ever having
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:46.320]  any hope of getting any traction whatsoever because they were building...
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:51.880]  It was the Mac 2.0. There was no lesson learned about why the Mac failed.
[01:45:51.880 --> 01:46:01.880]  Just by pricing it the way they did and they made it a way more amazing computer, but initially
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.240]  it was targeted at academia. Well, how the hell did they ever think that was going to
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:11.360]  be a big enough market to build a successful computer by only selling it to universities
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.640]  computer science departments? I mean, it's kind of crazy. I mean, I know that NeXT...
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:22.840]  Because Jobs just wanted to make the best possible computer and so he was going to find
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:27.840]  that was the justification for doing it and that's the thing why you have to keep the
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:32.280]  market in mind. Again, Jobs didn't change from that perspective. When he made the phone,
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.120]  he wanted to make the best possible phone. It's not like he said, oh, now the consumer
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.520]  market is ready. Let's do it. No, he just wanted... Apple just always wanted to make
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.000]  the best possible computers and those computers have shrunken in size over time and the market
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.080]  has come to Apple much more than Apple has sort of gone to the market.
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:53.440]  Yeah. All right, let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of this
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:01.560]  episode is our friends at Casper. Oh, man. Have you ever heard of Casper? Casper is... I
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.840]  don't know how to describe it. They're a sleep company. Look, they've got a new mattress
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:12.120]  that they've come out with called the Wave. It is the most innovative mattress in their
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:18.400]  line up and it's the first mattress of its kind to relieve pressure at 36 different points
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.560]  so you can feel relaxed in ways you never thought possible. These are some of the features
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:28.480]  of the Wave mattresses by Casper. They've got advanced temperature regulating technology,
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:34.420]  helps you sleep cool and comfortable without overheating during the night. Only the Wave
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:39.680]  has five layers of superior foam including a cushioning top layer for maximum comfort
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:44.840]  and it's their biggest breakthrough in sleep technology in the history of the company.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.800]  Look, these internet mattresses from Casper, they're really good. I mean, we've got a couple
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.920]  of them in the house. We love them. I don't know what kind of mattresses we had before
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.460]  but everybody likes them better than what we had before. The Wave in particular though,
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:04.960]  they studied back sleepers, stomach sleepers and side sleepers and the Wave is meant to
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.760]  be ideal for all three types. I said this before the last time they sponsored this show.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:14.240]  I don't know if I'm a weirdo or what but I'm all three. Every time I wake up in the middle
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.400]  of the night, if I'm on my side, the only way I can get back to sleep is if I turn over
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.600]  to my stomach or my back. If I wake up and I'm sleeping on my back, every time I wake
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.520]  up, whether it's to go to the bathroom or you just wake up for a couple of seconds before
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:33.200]  you doze back off, I got to switch to another way. No matter which way you sleep, the Wave
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:39.760]  is a good choice for you. They've got a patent pending contouring system that adjusts to
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:46.160]  your natural curves and here's the thing. It's a premium mattress. It's designed to
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:50.720]  keep its original form so you'll be supported for years to come. So even after a couple
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.360]  of years, even though it's foam and even though it gives on the contours of your body, once
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.520]  you get up off the mattress, it just looks brand new. It is right back to the shape that
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:06.640]  it was when it first came in. It really is great. Now, buying a mattress on the internet,
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:10.120]  you haven't felt it, you haven't sat on it, you haven't laid on it, you don't know what
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.040]  it's like, you don't know what this, sure, I'm saying it sounds good. Here's the thing.
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:22.020]  Casper has still a 100-night risk-free guarantee. So you buy the mattress, it shows up. When
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:30.920]  you get the Wave, it comes with in-home white glove delivery and setup for free. So the
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.720]  Wave mattress comes, they just come in, take it right to your room, set it up, and you
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.120]  have 100 days. You call them up on the 99th day and say, I don't like this thing. No questions
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.560]  asked, come pick it up, take it back, and give you all your money back. So you cannot
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.400]  lose. You get this thing, try it for 100 nights, and if you don't like it, you don't lose.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:56.280]  They'll take the whole thing back. We really like them here. It really is a great way to
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:03.800]  buy a mattress. And to save $100 on a Wave mattress, you can save 100 bucks with this.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:12.840]  Go to casper.com, C-A-S-P-E-R, casper.com slash talk show 100. No the, just talk show
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:18.480]  100. And then when you check out, just remember that promo code, talk show 100. And you save
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.040]  100 bucks. Terms and conditions apply. Now here's the other thing. There's one more thing
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:29.520]  that Casper wanted me to tell you, and I don't mind telling you. I'm not scared of the competition.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.800]  But after you're done listening to this episode, sponsored by Casper, you can check out the
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:41.080]  new Casper the Podcast, sponsored by Casper. That's the name of their podcast. Casper the
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:48.200]  Podcast, sponsored by Casper. It's an entire podcast about Casper, sponsored by Casper.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:55.160]  It's very meta. I'm intrigued by this. I can't imagine what the hell it's about. So I have
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:51:00.240]  to say, I'm going to give it a listen. It's available now on Apple Podcasts, SoundCloud,
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:06.160]  Stitcher, and anywhere else where you listen to podcasts. I'm damn curious about that.
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.240]  And the only thing I hope, I just hope it doesn't mean that they're going to stop sponsoring
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:17.040]  other podcasts. But I'll check it out. Casper the Podcast, sponsored by Casper. I wish they
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:25.440]  would have asked me advice on the title of their podcast. It's a little bit of a mouthful.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.600]  What else do we have to talk about? We've got, rolling out of these quarterly results,
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:34.920]  you wrote about this. Everybody's talking about this. Who's going to be the first trillion
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.600]  dollar company? And what do we mean by that? I'll wait. Ben?
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:24.040]  Ben
[01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:46.880]  Oh, sorry. I was muted. I just had the world's best explanation of market cap. But alas,
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.200]  on to history. No, basically how many shares you have times the share price. That's your
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.880]  market cap, how much your company is worth.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:55.660]  Steve Right. So you couldn't actually use it. In theory,
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:00.200]  it would be the price you'd have to pay to buy every share of the company. But that's
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:05.400]  not possible. Nobody has, by the time you start buying, nobody's going to buy every
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.400]  share of Apple.
[01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.000]  Ben It's theoretically possible.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.580]  Steve Right. Theoretically possible. But that's
[01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:14.520]  the price you would pay. Number of shares outstanding times the current price. That's
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:17.920]  your market cap. So in other words, it's what the company's worth. And there's a couple
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.320]  of the, who are the companies who are in the running for this? It's the, they're all fairly
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.320]  obvious.
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:25.600]  Ben Yeah. Well, I mean, this is the, actually
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.800]  I should get the updated numbers because Apple's share price was, was, was up a lot today.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:36.240]  Steve A lot today, 5%. And on a day when the market was literally like dead even, at least
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:42.320]  last I checked, it was right at like zero for the S&P 500. We got Apple's tops. A second
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:48.800]  is Amazon. I think Microsoft is now slipped into third. Microsoft and Google are very,
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.320]  very close. Microsoft and Google.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.440]  Ben Yeah. Microsoft has been, they passed Google
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.320]  a few weeks ago, which is, which is interesting.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:57.360]  Steve And then in fifth place is Facebook.
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.240]  Ben Oh, I got it. Yeah. So the big five, Apple
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:09.960]  is now at $894 billion. Amazon, 761 billion. Green on my chart here is Microsoft at 716
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:16.440]  billion. Google at 712. I am ignoring rounding here. And Facebook is at 508. What's interesting
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:22.960]  is that Facebook and Amazon in last fall were about the same price. They were both worth
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:29.560]  about $520 billion. Facebook is slightly down since then and Amazon has increased by 50%.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.560]  Steve Well, no. And if you look at your graph,
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:39.960]  you go back to, all the way back to Facebook's IPO, really, they tracked with Amazon very
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:46.200]  closely, where for the first year or so, they were under Amazon. And then starting in 2014,
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.600]  they crossed paths and then they actually surpassed Amazon, but not by a lot. And then
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:56.920]  for, you know, for the most part throughout 2016 and 2017.
[01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.960]  Ben To basically the end of 2017.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:01.560]  Steve Yeah. They were effectively, I mean, we're
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:06.360]  talking about like, just looking at this graph, clearly the type of thing where like one day's
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:12.800]  bad news, you know, like Jeff Bezos has a hangnail, could, you know, could alter it
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:16.880]  where they were dead even and then all of a sudden, holy hell, they're separated by
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:17.880]  a lot now.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:24.560]  Ben Yeah, $260 billion, which, you know, no one
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.280]  knows anything is probably part of the answer. And it's all a bit of a power game, right?
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.320]  I mean, it doesn't really matter. It's it's kind of breaking rights more than anything
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:37.820]  and who's actually in the brain other than fans, as it were, but I thought it was a useful
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.200]  the reason why I thought it was interesting to look at it from this perspective is one,
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:46.920]  Apple and Amazon are the top two. And I wanted to kind of draw out a point about how these
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:53.560]  companies are similar. But to the fact that around number $1 trillion market cap, it doesn't
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:57.960]  really mean anything. It's kind of irrational, yet we attach all kinds of importance to it.
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.520]  I think gets at the broader point about the consumer market that we talked about previously,
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:07.400]  right? People care about people care about silly stuff and quote unquote, silly stuff.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:11.820]  And maybe it's like you said that it is it really different if you're worth a billion
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:20.880]  or if you're worth 999 billion? No. But yeah, it doesn't really matter. But we think it
[01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.560]  matters. We care. We do care. You know, does it really matter if you're if your phone doesn't
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:30.120]  scroll absolutely buttery smooth? It doesn't actually matter. You know, you can still see
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.040]  the same content, you know what I mean? Like, I mean, this is you've had this debate a million
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.940]  times with Android fans or Windows fans. Does that stuff actually matter? That was kind
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:45.120]  of I'll tie it back. Go ahead. I'll tie it back to the opening of the show. Would it
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:52.360]  really have been any less amazing athletically if Wilt Chamberlain had scored 98 points in
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:56:00.080]  an NBA basketball game? No, it would have still been as you know, at least 98 percent
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:06.480]  as much of unbelievable. It doesn't seem mathematically possible achievement. But guess what? We wouldn't
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:12.760]  talk about it as much because he scored 100 points in an NBA basketball game. Right. Those
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:18.000]  right those two or ninety nine points. Right. If he had ninety nine points, it it would
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.720]  not have been as special. Yeah, I mean, Russell Westbrook basically won the MVP last year
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:26.080]  because he averaged a triple double, which is a total sort of like meaningless stat in
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.400]  the grand scheme of things. And I think it was a you shouldn't have won it. But you know
[01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:36.080]  what? It's a great story. It's a it's a great story. And stories matter. Humans like humans
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:43.340]  run on stories. I mean, I look at my own site. The articles that often resonate are not the
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:49.280]  ones with the brilliant analysis or something clever. It's the ones that tell a story. And
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:56.680]  people like that matters in a way that people like people know it implicitly, but they have
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:01.020]  a very difficult time articulating that. I think it's in the suffered about disruption
[01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:07.760]  in housing companies like like consumer consumer. If you're selling to consumers, there's so
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:12.040]  much that goes into it that it doesn't go on a spreadsheet. And that's sort of stuff
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:18.680]  that matters. Yeah. Anyhow, so the point of this article was, you know, these companies,
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.200]  Apple and Amazon are really polar opposites. Everything about them is different, right?
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:28.080]  I mentioned the phone, the fire phone before. Like it was predictable that it was a failure
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:34.240]  because Amazon is even more extreme of a service company than Apple is a product company. That's
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:39.440]  even possible, right? Let me hear. I'm going to read your words from the from today's daily
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:43.360]  update because I think this is perfect. Here's what you said. I mean it when I say these
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.440]  companies are the complete opposite. Apple sells products. It makes Amazon sells products
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:52.760]  made by anyone and everyone. Apple brags about focus. Amazon calls itself the everything
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.520]  store. Apple is a product company that struggles at services. Amazon is a services company
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:02.360]  that struggles at product. Apple is the highest margins and profits in the world. Amazon brags
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.240]  that others margin is their opportunity and until recently barely registered any profits
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:14.000]  at all and underlying all of this. Apple is an extreme example of a functional organization
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.360]  and Amazon is an extreme example of a divisional one. I mean, that's perfect. I mean, I, I,
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.480]  you know, you're never going to come out with a better thing like that. Speaking here extemporaneously
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.920]  on the podcast. So I've just got her to say it right there. I thought that was my favorite
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:31.480]  paragraph I've read in a while because that is, well, thank you. That is spot on though.
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:37.800]  They really are opposites. Yeah. And, and it gets back to the Microsoft point, right?
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:43.800]  There's no like one way to succeed in business. And you know, I think it's easy for, you know,
[01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:47.040]  Apple fans to fall into the lens of everything should be like Apple because Apple is super
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:51.960]  successful when the reality is, is most people should not be like Apple because what Apple
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:56.120]  does is really difficult in order to accomplish. And it has so like so much that goes into
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.660]  it. I think I've, I think I've mentioned this on the podcast previously, but I was talking
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:06.440]  to a Windows engineer back when I was at Microsoft about why I always mentioned the Android scrolling
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.200]  thing because it's my single least favorite thing about Android. And, and I don't want
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:13.280]  to hear about it. Even the latest phones still have, still have problems. But, but I was
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:17.680]  complaining about it way back then. I'm like, why is it that Windows phone can come out
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:21.720]  and V1 has, it has good scrolling and iPhone obviously is amazing and the Android is so
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:25.260]  bad. And he went into some technical stuff about, you know, some of the Android implementation
[01:59:25.260 --> 01:59:28.800]  details and, and, and the, you know, the, while it's running a virtual warehouse or
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:34.200]  stuff. But he's like, honestly, the real answer is at the end of the day, Microsoft and Apple
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.680]  have been writing graphics drivers for 30 years and Google has been writing them for
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:44.760]  three years. He's like, like there's just stuff you learn that, that pays off. And you
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:49.000]  know, certainly that goes into all sorts of Apple's advantages. But again, that's not
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.760]  the only way to succeed. And, and heaven knows having great scrolling is not the only way
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:57.960]  to succeed in the phone market as Google sort of clearly demonstrated. And it's useful to
[01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:02.880]  think about these two companies in that context. Like there's no one right way to do it.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:09.480]  Yeah, that's very true. That's very true. I cast myself very far afield with that anecdote,
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:13.280]  but hopefully, hopefully you came back in. But I think what was interesting though about
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:20.000]  these two companies is, you know, the, the both are really fanatical from sort of the
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.940]  top down about emphasizing their focus on, on the, on the end user, on, on the customer
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:28.800]  and what makes the customer happy. And, and the reason why I think that's, that's interesting
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:33.440]  is, you know, one, it's always been striking that both would speak the same language yet
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:39.400]  go about their business so completely differently. Right. But, but two, you know, like I said,
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.520]  I like to think about this sort of disruption thing. And I wrote that article around the
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.240]  Apple, around the iPhone 5C that was saying why Apple would not be disrupted. And my take
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:53.040]  there was if you're focused on the user experience, on making something that's great to use, the
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:57.560]  great thing about it is you're never going to perfect it. Like nothing is ever going
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:02.600]  to be perfect. And, or good enough, you know, there's a, right, right. Yeah. There is no
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:07.460]  good enough when it comes to like the experience of using something good enough is like a disruption
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:12.800]  term and there's good enough and overshoot this idea that the incumbent overshoots what
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:17.040]  customers want and customers stop caring about that feature and they start focusing on other
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:23.080]  things like price. But if you can't overshoot how great it is to use something, right. You're
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:27.520]  not like, Oh, this phone is too fun to use. I want to get a different one. And it's as
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:32.000]  you point that you quote from, uh, I forget if it was Bezos shareholder letter this year
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.320]  or his original one that he always reprints from 1997. Um, but that, you know, one of
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:42.120]  the great things about customers is they're, they're never fully satisfied because once
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:49.000]  you've delighted them with two day delivery, for example, for free, uh, and they're like,
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.920]  Holy crap, I just ordered this two days ago and I didn't pay anything extra and he ding
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:55.600]  dong, here it is at my door. Uh, they're amazed and they're happy and they think that's this
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.480]  Amazon is great. And then like by the time the third box arrives like that, they expected
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:04.800]  two days, right? It showed up at 7pm. Why wasn't it here at 4pm? And then you've got
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:09.400]  to do one day delivery and now they're, they've got to get same day delivery and to get, you
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:15.400]  know, the, the wow factor in, uh, you know, you, you get, you know, Bezos emphasize it,
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:19.840]  but it's true and everybody knows it's true. We get used to everything, right? I mean,
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:27.360]  are you amazed that you get to, uh, go to the bathroom and indoors with a electric light,
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:33.440]  electric light over your head, uh, and have a water system where you can hit a button
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:39.760]  or pull a dial and the waste just goes away. Are you amazed by that? We were talking about,
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.200]  we were talking about calling home, right? Like I, I, I, we started this call to be complaining
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:49.440]  about Skype as usual when, when 15 years ago I was standing at a payphone trying to call
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.120]  home using a calling card, right? I mean, it's, it's so true. And that was sort of the
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:58.680]  key addition. That was the point of this article was like, I wanted to sort of go back to that
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.400]  article I wrote five years ago and it's like, you know, I actually didn't have this quite
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:05.680]  right. It's not just that a user experience can never, cause I always thought about it
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:09.720]  as like a, like a, like you approach a perfect user experience, but you can never get there.
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:14.720]  But actually it's, it's different. The consumer expectations, like, you know, the phrase moving
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:20.800]  the goalposts are, they're constantly changing. What is great today is totally blase tomorrow.
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:27.400]  And it follows that if your business, if your business is predicated not on a product, and
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.600]  this is where Apple arguably went wrong with the phone, you know, we talked about it earlier
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:36.080]  with, with, with the, with the airport. If your focus, if your focus is not the product,
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:41.860]  but on the user, on making them happy, meeting their needs, and you're able to sort of let
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:46.920]  go of the means by which you do it and keep that as your North star, that is the best
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:51.760]  possible way to build a long-term sustainable business. Because it's like having, it's like,
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:54.880]  you know, the, those Greyhound races where they have like the, the, the bone of going
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:58.480]  around and they're all chasing it. Right. And you never catch it. Like you're never
[02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:05.200]  going to catch it. And from a business perspective, that's great because to achieve your goal
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.480]  is often the worst thing that can happen to you as a company. Cause then you're like,
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:13.360]  okay, what's next? And, and, and that's never going to happen if your goal is making people
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.440]  happy on a consistent basis. Uh, yeah, exactly. I mean, just you, people,
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:22.480]  everybody listening to us talk. I mean, the average episode of the talk show, I think
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:27.200]  is somewhere over a hundred megabytes. And yes, I could, if I really were constrained,
[02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:32.280]  I could, I, you know, and I were doing this 15 years ago, I'd use a lower bit rate. But
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.720]  whatever size I would have got to where we were still, it sounded decent enough that
[02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:43.340]  people wouldn't mind listening to us. Uh, whatever big that MP3 file is times how many
[02:04:43.340 --> 02:04:48.560]  people download this show, it would have bankrupted me. And I, I don't know, you know, 15 years
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:52.700]  ago when I started Daring Viable, there was no way to host a pod, for someone like me
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:58.700]  to host a podcast. It wasn't possible. It, you know, and that's just 15 years.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:03.520]  Yeah. And it's like this with everything. I mean, you look at the phone and, and you
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:07.440]  know, we, there's complaints about like, Oh, portrait mode is kind of lame. It takes some
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:10.800]  use to have weird artifacts in your picture. It's like, one, you're taking a picture on
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:17.160]  your phone. Two, it looks amazing. Three, the computer is simulating thousands of dollars
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:22.160]  worth of equipment and doing a passive challenge. Yeah, it looks like terrible. It looks like
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:26.840]  standing here. But it's, it's a great thing. And honestly, like I kind of meant, I mentioned
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:30.960]  this, I don't think this article, but a daily update, like there is a very, that phrase
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.760]  about consumers being divinely discontent, discontent is a very inherently optimistic
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:40.880]  sort of phrase about humanity in general, because you think about like automation coming
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:44.560]  along and people are so worried about people losing their jobs and computers taking over.
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.920]  Well, if you look back, you had the same concerns with the agriculture revolution, the same
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:52.800]  concerns as the industrial revolution. And not to say the transition wasn't painful and
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.160]  difficult and it was, and there were wars and it was terrible and awful. But if you
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:02.880]  just, so I'm not at all overlooking that and I think we should take that to heart when
[02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:07.720]  we think about the internet revolution, what's happening. But, but if you zoom out, like
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:14.280]  you and I, you are getting paid for this podcast and I get paid to, to write, write these articles
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:19.280]  and those jobs didn't exist. And yeah, maybe we are on the sort of the cutting edge of
[02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:24.960]  new jobs enabled by the internet, but you look at, you look around you at the next hundred
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:28.240]  people you meet on the street, how many of them are doing jobs that existed in any shape,
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:33.160]  way or form a hundred years ago? And why? Because humans are divinely disconnect, discontent.
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:35.840]  We're always figuring out problems and ways to fix them.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:39.880]  Right. And both, I think your key insight in that, in that update is that in their own
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:43.680]  ways, and they are different ways, but in their own ways, Amazon and Apple at their
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:50.840]  fundamental level are both keyed in to take advantage of that and to push the limits of,
[02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:56.920]  you know, to push that ahead. You know, I, we were, I was just talking to somebody to
[02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:05.080]  a couple of guys, Glenn Fleischman and a couple of others about the original, I forget what
[02:07:05.080 --> 02:07:12.240]  we were reminiscing about on Twitter, but about the original iPad event and the, a bunch
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:17.600]  of us were there in the hands-on area until Apple very politely, like 90 minutes after,
[02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:21.760]  you know, it opened up, we're like, Hey guys, we don't want to kick you out, but we're kicking
[02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:26.840]  you out. We couldn't stop playing with it. And, and we weren't, none of us were on the,
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.900]  the, at that time in 2010, we're on like the review, you know, that was, that was still
[02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:36.240]  back in 2010 when they were like Walt Mossberg and David Pogue and Ed Beg at USA Today were
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:41.480]  like the only three people who got like review units. So we didn't get to leave with one.
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:45.160]  We had to like wait until they went on sale and buy one and wait till it showed up. So,
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:49.320]  you know, we wanted to play with it. And the thing I was so amazed about was just how gorgeous
[02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:57.680]  the display was. I was just like, I'd never seen a 10 inch display that was so beautiful
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:05.040]  and that the pixels seemed so small and the color was so bright and it was like, it was
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:11.200]  definitely a better display than any Mac book display at the time. It was just better. Those
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:12.200]  displays,
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:16.440]  Yeah, it was a pretty retinol. So there was no, even though that wasn't retinol, it looks,
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:17.440]  there was no comparison.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:23.480]  It looks terrible now. It looks like it's broken because it's not retinol. Apple has
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.800]  keyed in on that. Amazon has keyed in on that. And there, the thing is, and, and in both
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:33.980]  of those ways, they're aligned with their customers. They're that, that all of the ways
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:39.800]  that Apple is pushing ahead to make things nicer experience on their products is about
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:45.920]  making their customers happier. And all of the ways that Amazon is focused on you know,
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:51.200]  getting better service and providing better products and more products and faster shipping
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:55.680]  and getting into groceries with the whole foods is all about making their customers
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:02.200]  happier. They're just in perfect alignment with that. And with Facebook and Google and,
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.400]  you know, Microsoft is sort of the wild card, right? Because they're just sort of, they're
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:10.840]  like, use, your description is that they are an enterprise company now. And so they're,
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:16.000]  they're the, the, the odd one out of all five. But Facebook and Google are effectively in
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:23.040]  the same business selling ads targeted to what they know about the people using their
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:29.560]  products. And in a lot of ways, their business is not aligned with making their customers
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:35.240]  ever happier because Apple only makes money when people buy more stuff from Apple. And
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:39.720]  so they're only buying, you know, it's the more money they make from John Gruber, the,
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:43.520]  you know, they're not doing anything that annoys me, but to make more money from me,
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:50.180]  Google has to show me more ads or possibly ever more intrusive ads that freak me out
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:54.080]  because how do you know that I was looking for that, et cetera, et cetera. It's not in
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:58.860]  perfect alignment with my customer satisfaction and my happiness and my pleasure with Google
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:01.280]  or Facebook.
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:05.400]  It's true though. But, but one thing I do push back on is, you know, the whole phrase,
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:10.240]  like, if you're, if you're not the customer, you're the product or whatever that is. I
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:15.160]  hate it. I absolutely hate it. And I hate it because the, let's go back to Apple and
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.340]  Amazon for a second. What makes this focus on the customer so powerful is not just that
[02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:24.900]  it keeps your business sort of relevant in the longterm in a really powerful way, but
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:30.280]  also that gives you power over your entire sort of supply chain. In Apple, it can be
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:34.600]  the supply chain of actual supply chain and components or it could be the app store and
[02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:36.180]  all the like apples.
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:39.680]  The real reason Apple beat so big this quarter is because their services revenue was through
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:44.540]  the roof. And at the end of the day, Apple's services revenue, well, they deserve it. It's
[02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:47.760]  kind of bullshit, right? Cause it's all app developers and Apple is just taking a skim
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:52.200]  off of it. Why can they do that? Because they own the, they own the customer. If those app
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:54.760]  developers want to reach the customers, they have to go through Apple and Apple's going
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.520]  to take, going to take a piece of that. I mean, that's Amazon's longterm goal as well.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.920]  They take a, let me take a note here and I don't want to interrupt you. I mean, you're
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.600]  going to, this is going to be a long side. So maybe you better finish your thought.
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:11.160]  Well the point though is, is there is power that comes from owning the customer relationship
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.600]  and that absolutely applies to Facebook and Google. The reason they are so powerful, the
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:22.140]  reason why, you know, Google is always my favorite example. Like Google, what, every
[02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:26.600]  single site on the internet actually goes to the effort to make their site amenable
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:31.920]  to Google and they have like a map of their site. Like that's there just for search crawlers,
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.280]  right? That according to Google's specification, like Google doesn't have to do any work to
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:40.160]  have every, like everyone does the work for Google to put themselves there so Google can
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.420]  profit. Why? Because all the customers reach the, go to the internet via Google. Same thing
[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:50.220]  with Facebook. And so there is a limit and Facebook, for example, they stopped the number
[02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:55.560]  of ads that went into the newsfeed a year ago. And why? Because they were worried about
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:00.800]  the customer experience. No, not because people were paying them, but because all their power
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:06.920]  and all their profits and all the things they get from advertisers ultimately rest on the
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:12.200]  fact that they have all the customers. And so is it as aligned as an Apple Amazon model?
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:17.080]  No, it's not. But it's also not the case where they just treat people like crap because they
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:20.780]  don't need to care. They do need to care and they do care very much.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:27.600]  So I've, this thought has been festering in my head for a while and it's, you know, I'm
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.720]  always, I know that there's people out there who think I'm always looking for, for ways
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:38.240]  to say good things about Apple, but I'm actually always thinking the opposite is I think, you
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:44.240]  know, I know where my biases are and I want to defend against them. And the services thing
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:49.640]  and the growing services revenue. And if you look at, you know, go to Jason Snell's sixcolors.com
[02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:54.880]  where he's got some breaks down Apple's financials into graphs, which I think are very well done
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:01.480]  and really help visualize the actual data and Dan to visualize the trends. The services
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:09.120]  thing was stuck in the four billions per quarter for a long number of quarters. And it was
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:14.520]  steadily going up quarter after quarter, but in the last couple of years, it's, it's gone
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:21.160]  on a curve. It's no longer linear. It is going upwards and it's a curve and it coincides
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:26.680]  with when Apple has started talking specifically about services, services, services on these
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:31.880]  quarterly calls and, and building it up. And they're, you know, they're, they weren't wrong
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:37.240]  to do it because they were correct that this was going to be a bigger part of, of their
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.040]  revenue. But listen to this, here's a tweet from Mark
[02:13:40.040 --> 02:13:45.320]  Gurman yesterday. You know, in his role as a Bloomberg reporter, I guess he got to speak
[02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:51.640]  to Apple's CFO. Here's his tweet. And while Apple music is all the talk, when I spoke
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:57.400]  with Apple CFO, Luca Maestri this afternoon, he said that the app store is actually the
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:03.240]  strong driver of the rapid services growth. And you, I, you know, I don't think that's
[02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:07.400]  a surprise to you. You sort of alluded to that a few moments ago. Well, here's my sort
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:15.960]  of, hmm, about that. Where, where's the money that the app store makes coming from? I think
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:21.400]  it's games. And what type of games are they making the money from? I think a lot of it
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:28.680]  is, are these games like Candy Crush? And I, I don't think that that is a source of
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:35.080]  revenue that Apple should be particularly proud of. I, you know, I think that there's
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:42.680]  this whole sector of casual games that are, oh shoot, you're going to have to help me
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:50.000]  on this. So there's pay, pay to win, pay to win. And so, so, so there's three, there's
[02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  three types, which is, or sorry, they're free to play. Both pay to win, free to play are
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.520]  the same idea. The idea is you, you, you can pay, you can play it for free, but if you
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:03.560]  actually want to win the game, you're gonna have to pay money along the way, as opposed
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.880]  to free to win, which, which you never, it's free and you can win the game without paying
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:15.120]  a dime, like, like Fortnite. Yeah. Fortnite is a game. I wrote about it recently. My son
[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:20.400]  is into it. I just saw an article in the New York Times today about how Fortnite is driving
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.520]  this trend of e-sports where people are, they're actually like, it's, it's like, it literally
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:30.600]  is, it sounds amazing, but they're rejuvenating malls and movie theaters. You know how like
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:36.240]  retail in the U.S. has gone into decline and shopping malls, a lot of shopping malls have
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:41.200]  either closed or they've like closed like the West Wing and moved everybody to the East
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:47.520]  Wing and have, they're reopening the malls to build theaters where people can watch people
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.440]  play video games and the bleeding game is Fortnite. And if you had told me this a year
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:57.120]  ago, I would have rolled my eyes, but I really, I don't play Fortnite. I've never, I've haven't
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:03.960]  played for a moment. But I've, I've spent, not hours, but well over an hour in the aggregate
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:10.680]  watching my son play. And I enjoy it. I enjoy watching him play the game. It is to me, I
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:17.440]  see the brilliance of this Fortnite game. It is to me clearly more balanced in a way
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.440]  that a sport is properly balanced, right? Like the rules of any successful sport have
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:27.020]  some kind of balance to them between the offense and the defense, right? Like the, the rules
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:33.680]  of every sport, basketball, soccer, baseball, whatever you name it, start out shaky and
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:38.600]  then they evolve in the way that makes it a better game. Like you, basketball originally
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:44.960]  didn't have dribbling. You had, you just, it was like, like Ultimate Frisbee is sort
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:49.040]  of like that. Like if you had the ball, you had to, you had to stay still and pass it
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:55.440]  to somebody else. Well, you know, dribbling made it a better game. Fortnite has rules
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:17:01.440]  and it just seems balanced in a way that is like a sport. I can see it. But the amazing
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:06.480]  thing about Fortnite is it's a free game. It's, it's super high quality graphics and
[02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:11.720]  sound and everything, but you can download it for free and play it for, for free. And
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:16.080]  you have just as good a chance of winning and growing an experience as somebody who
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:20.760]  buys their, they make money through in-app purchases, but their in-app purchases are
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:27.400]  for things like costumes for your character and dances, dance moves your character can
[02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:33.760]  pull, you know, effectively like sticker packs for a game. And they don't give your character
[02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:40.280]  any sort of advantage. So I'm, I'm a grown man with a nice income. So I could, if I were
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:45.800]  a Fortnite enthusiast, easily pay them, let's say a hundred dollars of real US dollars to
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:53.200]  buy stuff. And there are games like this and, and buy weapons and armor and somebody else
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:18:00.040]  like a 14 year old kid who doesn't have a job and doesn't have money. And as parents
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:06.920]  who say, no, I'm not giving you a hundred dollars to spend on in game garbage doesn't
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.920]  have them and can't beat me because I've got these weapons. Fortnite is the opposite of
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:17.480]  that. You play for free and you have every bit as good a chance as somebody who pays.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.560]  That's amazing to me. And then, you know, Candy Crush is the one I'm familiar with,
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:25.940]  but there's dozens of, and I know there's all these games with angry cartoon characters
[02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:34.320]  with beards. I forget that it, you know, Clash of Clans, where if you don't pay that, sure,
[02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:38.800]  it's a free download for the app, but if you don't pay the money and keep paying the money
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:44.440]  as you continue your addiction to this game, you don't have a chance or you have barely
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.320]  a chance, you know, and like, you know,
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:52.320]  So I have two, two points to follow up. One, you are exactly right that the vast majority
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:56.400]  of Apple's revenue from the store comes from the exactly those type of games. And I wrote
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:01.880]  about this way back when Chuckery started that I, same thing. I felt like Apple was
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.120]  being blinded. Like this is when I was on my big campaign that Apple needed to allow
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:10.760]  upgrade pricing and they need to allow subscription for apps because I'm like, they think the
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:15.880]  app store is a huge success, but actually they're making all this money on these games.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:21.160]  And it's not just that, that the games were of questionable, you know, are they, is that
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:26.120]  something that you want to be, can you be proud of making money off of all those games?
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.560]  But also that those, all those games were easily ported to Android. Like there's no,
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:36.040]  they don't have any interaction with the sort of, with the operating system. There's no,
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:41.880]  it's not like they're using iOS controls to build it. And so they all were, they were
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:48.680]  all ported and it really diluted Apple's one sort of really meaningful app advantage when
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.720]  actually it ended up being that this is the stuff that actually mattered. Like I still
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:20:00.440]  believe Apple foreclosed a huge opportunity to have a thriving ecosystem of high end productivity
[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.600]  apps that would have never been ported to Android because those are the apps that have
[02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:06.760]  been so much more difficult to port, not just because porting is hard in general because
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:10.560]  Android is fractured and there's so many devices to support and all that stuff's real, but
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:14.320]  that's easy to handle if you're just running a game on Unity and Unity is abstracting everything
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:19.200]  away for you, right? And Apple, I think was another example where they were, they were
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:24.920]  getting billions of dollars and, and it blinded them to what was going on there. So that's
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:29.400]  number one. Number two though, this, this idea of these games, I wrote this article
[02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:33.360]  called selling feelings. I put it in the show notes and in this case I was talking about
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:37.520]  League of Legends, which was the same sort of idea and also very popular from a sort
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:42.080]  of e-sport perspective, although not, not Fortnite level. But, or, or I should give
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:46.340]  credit to Players Unknown's Battlegrounds, which Fortnite was kind of a, this, the second
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:52.840]  version came after them. But, but the, this idea of creating a world that people like
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:58.280]  to be in and, and has a visual component and an audience and people watching. And then
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:04.000]  once you create the world, then you own the economy of the world and you can actually
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:10.320]  sell stuff. And selling the stuff again is no different than selling like a luxury handbag,
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:15.000]  right? You, you, you, you buy it because you enjoy it. It gives you status. You like showing
[02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:21.880]  it off. It differentiates you. And like these companies are creating worlds and they're
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:26.180]  creating more immersive worlds and larger worlds by virtue of being free because everyone
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:29.480]  can be there. Everyone can watch it. Everyone can be familiar with it and, and free is a
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:34.040]  big deal. Like that, you know, you talk about Facebook and Google, like they, they will
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:38.120]  never be supplanted by a paid competitor ever. It's folly to even think about it because
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:42.040]  both of them are predicated on having the most possible people, the most possible data,
[02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:45.920]  which means a free, it's like our messaging discussion earlier, a free alternative is
[02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:50.040]  always going to win. And it's the same thing here. If you have a free game, a big reason
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:53.800]  why Fortnite displaced Players Unknown's Battlegrounds is you had to pay, you had to pay for Players
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:57.200]  Unknown's Battlegrounds and Fortnite was free. And so you're going to have more users, but
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.760]  you have more users. You actually have new, completely new capabilities to sell things
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:07.640]  that, that, yes, they seem stupid, right? They seem stupid. Like scrolling seems stupid.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:12.760]  They seem stupid. Like all this sort of like, like 10, like $1 trillion seems stupid. Yes.
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:17.640]  If you want to take a very analytical, you know, sort of nerdy approach and say, well,
[02:22:17.640 --> 02:22:22.200]  999 billion is the same as 1 trillion. Who really cares? I, yes, I guess you're right,
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.460]  but that's not how humans actually work. Humans actually care about round numbers. Humans
[02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:30.240]  actually care about having a cool dance move. Humans actually care about showing off. They
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:35.620]  actually care about status. And all these games are profiting by tapping into, by becoming
[02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:42.320]  more human, by becoming more in touch with what customers actually want. Right. Right.
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:50.800]  Like you know, we go to the playground and I'm wearing, you know, $150 pair of LeBron
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:58.680]  Winston sneakers from Nike and you're wearing a $40 pair of sneakers. Do I have any kind
[02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:04.280]  of advantage to beat you on the court? No. But is there, you know, is there a reasonable,
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:08.760]  you know, might you be jealous of my $150 sneakers? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like
[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:13.380]  the game, I just find it fascinating. I feel like exactly like you said, it is more like
[02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:19.880]  real life. Like there is, you know, human emotions, status and you know, just feeling,
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:23.040]  you know, the way you, if you really feel like you've got some cool sneakers, you know,
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:29.200]  you feel good about yourself. It's really fascinating to me, but I really think that
[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:34.240]  the services thing, I'm not saying Apple should be ashamed of it, but I just don't think,
[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:37.840]  I don't know that that's entirely clean money that's coming from those games like Candy
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:45.400]  Crush and, and it's not, you know, you know, I like, I like playing casino games. I don't
[02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:49.920]  like playing slot machines personally, but you know, I don't, you know, I'm not going
[02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:53.340]  to, you know, if that's what, you know, it's clearly more popular than, than the table
[02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:57.920]  games that I like to play. And I get it. I know that there are people who, you know,
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:05.120]  can't handle, you know, their gambling addiction. You know, I'm sort of a libertarian in the
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:09.400]  sense that I don't think that casinos should be illegal because some people have a problem
[02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:14.320]  with gambling. I don't think alcohol should be illegal because there are many people who
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:19.440]  can't control their consumption of alcohol. I think those things are unfortunate, but
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:23.560]  I don't think, you know, personally, and I think most people agree with me, I mean, our
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:29.280]  country tried, tried outlawing alcohol and it didn't go, didn't go very well. You know,
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:37.520]  it's not a perfect world. But, you know, that said, and so I don't think that like, I'm
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:43.160]  not willing to say that Apple should ban the Candy Crush type games from the App Store,
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.520]  but I still, I don't know that they should be proud about it. And I wouldn't be surprised
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.360]  if at some point in the next few years, the attention of the entire world sort of comes
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:56.120]  down on those type of games and the people who are addicted to them. Because I, what
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:01.600]  I've read, and I don't think this is surprising, is that those games make almost all of their
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:06.960]  money from, and they even use the same term that casinos use. They call them whales, right?
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:12.240]  It's, there's all of the regular people who might just enjoy Candy Crush and pay, you
[02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:18.240]  know, maybe they paid, I don't know, $10, $20 a week to buy their gold coins and can
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:22.760]  easily afford $10 to $20 a week. And you think like, but that's crazy, you know, in one sense
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:28.080]  you think that's crazy because like, you know, you buy like a high-end new title for the
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:33.440]  PlayStation and it's $60. And that's like an expensive video game, right? $60 and you
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:41.000]  get like the new whatever it's called. And here there's, you know, millions of people
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.920]  spending let's, I don't know, $10, $20 a week on Candy Crush. And you think, well, hell,
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:52.440]  if you spend $10 a week on Candy Crush, that's $500 a year for a video game. Like, if you
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:56.400]  spend $20, it's $1,000, you know? But, you know, people, there's a lot of people who
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:03.800]  spend $20 a week on scratch-off tickets at the, for the lottery. You know, that's not
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:09.440]  a problem. But the thing I've read is that there's, the problem is that people who are
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:16.600]  spending, you know, $100 or $150 a week or however much money they have in their debit
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:22.000]  account they spend on Candy Crush stuff, you know, money that they can't afford to lose.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.280]  And that those are the people who they make the overwhelming amount of money from. And
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:32.760]  I do wonder whether ultimately a company like Apple and Google, you know, for running these
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:37.640]  stores and enabling this, you know, you have to look at that. So I don't know.
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:39.520]  Yeah, I mean...
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.520]  That's my side rant on the services revenue, quote-unquote services.
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.440]  No, I mean, the whole, like, I mean, what's the, well, here's another example. I mean,
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.640]  this is an issue with all the services revenue. And if you want to get into Apple in long-term
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:58.200]  concerns, it remains being that they start reaching into areas that they're not as great
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:04.440]  at for growth. And that's, you know, it's not as great of a customer experience. But
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.600]  for the, here's a perfect example. What's the second biggest item in services revenue
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:12.040]  after the App Store? Do you know?
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:18.360]  No, actually, I don't know. And I don't even, I feel like I should be good at guessing this.
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:19.360]  iCloud storage.
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  Really?
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:25.040]  iCloud storage. It is that crappy five gigabytes on your phone. And it comes up bugging you,
[02:27:25.040 --> 02:27:29.520]  bugging you, bugging you to upgrade to storage. And Apple is out here on these earnings calls
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:32.720]  bragging about the fact that they provide a shitty backup experience on their phones
[02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:36.560]  and it makes them a lot of money for all intents and purposes. And again, this is where they
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:40.680]  get in trouble because this is their narrative. The services are driving it. And from a financial
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.600]  perspective, it's a very fair argument to make because yes, our user base may not be
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:51.760]  growing very rapidly or maybe not at all, but we're making more and more money from
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.760]  our users.
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:58.880]  But that money, it's not all like making a great customer experience money. It's just
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:27:59.880]  not.
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:07.920]  That's really, you know, wow, that's, I'm sad to hear that. Hopefully, hopefully they're
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:16.440]  of the opinion that they can increase those storage tiers and keep selling, you know,
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:21.320]  you know, keep making that money even by making the free tier a lot bigger than five gigabytes.
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:27.640]  It would be interesting to know how that breaks down. Like how many of the people, because
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:31.320]  I think the biggest problem with their storage tiers, I think all of them should be bigger
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:37.920]  for what you're paying for or cheaper for the same prices in one way or the other.
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:43.520]  But the single biggest problem to me is the five gigabyte free tier because most people
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:49.880]  want to use the free tier and five gigabytes just isn't enough. And every single year it
[02:28:49.880 --> 02:28:56.240]  becomes less good because the biggest thing, at least in mine and my account, and certainly
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:00.600]  most people's is their photos and videos and their photos and videos keep getting bigger
[02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.360]  because the cameras are getting better. I mean, we, you know, I'm four K's off by default
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:11.680]  and I'm sure a very large majority of iPhone users don't even know that they could enable
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:17.280]  four K in settings and not that it's hidden, but that it's just not the thing people think
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:18.280]  about.
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:21.440]  Most people think I want to shoot video and they just go to photos and scroll over to
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:26.780]  video and they need to shoot video. Right. But even those default videos are getting
[02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:32.320]  bigger because the camera's getting better. Yep. And here you go from, from, from the
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:36.160]  earnings call bragging. I call it the Luca may street. I called storage revenue was up
[02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:42.360]  by over 50% year over year to a new all time record. I really hope that they think that
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:47.480]  they see that that's however good that is that it's still, they need to, cause that's
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:53.080]  one of the things I'm looking for at WWDC this year is I, if they don't announce, you
[02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:56.720]  know, like to me it's very much equivalent, you know, cause it's storage. So it's very
[02:29:56.720 --> 02:30:02.840]  comparable it to the 16 gigabyte base storage on the actual phones for a number of years
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:12.000]  and how long they stuck with 16 gigabytes as the entry level. Which is, is problematic
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:18.360]  because the OS itself was, has always been five, six gigabytes. So as a percentage of
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:24.740]  free space, the size of the OS mattered way more for 16. It's just, it's just almost impossible
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:29.680]  for even a typical consumer to keep everything in 16 gigabytes and they kept it for too long.
[02:30:29.680 --> 02:30:33.240]  And at the point where I really felt like, Hey, this is, you know, I was even bringing
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:37.680]  it up. It was something I brought up, I think at least two years in a row with Phil Schiller
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:44.440]  on the talk show live at WWDC. And I felt like when they finally upped the base storage
[02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:49.640]  to 32 is when it was at the point where I really couldn't, I couldn't agree that this
[02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:55.880]  was even morally acceptable, you know, that this is just criminal to charge people because
[02:30:55.880 --> 02:31:00.760]  the app part of the Apple brand is you can't go wrong with an Apple product, right? You
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:05.200]  come in the Apple store and everything, part of the brand is part of the way that the company
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:08.360]  is supposed to be. We're not going to sell you something that's actually a bad product.
[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:16.060]  Like the lowest model of anything is, is still a good product. That's why the nine 99 Mac
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:21.560]  book air is starting to, you know, starting to, to raise eyebrows, right? Like is that,
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:26.320]  is it really justifiable to charge a thousand dollars for the Mac book air as we know it
[02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:36.400]  with the non retina screen and a CPU that came out in 1983. It's questionable. 16 gigabyte
[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:41.320]  iPhones were like that. And to me, the five gigabyte cloud iCloud storage is, is maybe
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:46.680]  even worse because of how much more important backups are than anything else and how many
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:51.320]  people there are. And it doesn't make sense. It comes back to, you know, we, you and I
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:55.000]  were just talking about this earlier in the show that people aren't entirely rational
[02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:03.040]  in what they do, right? That people will buy $700 iPhones happily or at least willingly
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:11.400]  and then refuse to spend 99 cents a month to increase their iCloud storage. You know,
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:14.920]  whether it's irrational or whether it's the confusion that you hear it all the time, you
[02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:17.440]  hear it all the time when people talk about this, where they'll have like, you know, their
[02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:21.520]  mom was having, or somebody else in their family is having a, their dad's having a problem
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:26.160]  with his iPhone. It's barking about something and then they, you know, take a look at it
[02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:29.940]  and it's because the iCloud is fully cycle. I don't even know what an iCloud is. Why the
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:34.700]  hell would I spend 99 cents a month for an iCloud? I don't know what an iCloud is, even
[02:32:34.700 --> 02:32:38.240]  though that's exactly what would solve the problem of their backups not being able to
[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:42.560]  go to iCloud because they ran out of storage. They just won't do it. It's not the 99 cents.
[02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:49.960]  It's just irrational, but they won't do it. So the free, that's, that's really this services
[02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:55.200]  thing. It's, I don't know. No, it's, it's, it's, the whole thing is kind of stinky, right?
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:59.400]  If you think about Apple's thing, I mean like again, there's the 30% again, it's Apple's
[02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:03.480]  right. 30% is lower than what, you know, CompUSA used to charge to put software on the shelf
[02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.560]  and anyone can put the store up there. I'm not like, I'm not saying Apple's is not in
[02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:11.780]  their rights to, to, to, to charge it. But at the end of the day, they are charging 30%
[02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:17.240]  for doing nothing for all intents and purposes, right? Like it is a tax that they are in a
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:23.820]  position to charge and, and it is the basis again that this whole narrative, and again,
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:29.000]  it's a legitimate narrative that they're driving in. To me, that's a little, it's a little
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:34.040]  concerning, you know, that the, the growth story for this company is not about being
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:41.080]  what's best for the consumer in some respects or, and again, I'm not saying that in an extreme
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:46.120]  hyperbolic sort of way, just pointing out this is where, this is where things can go
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:50.680]  wrong. This is where slippage can occur when you, when you do lose sight of the customer.
[02:33:50.680 --> 02:33:55.640]  Right. Anywhere where Apple's alignment is off with what's good for the customer, given
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:58.880]  that they're, you know, the money that they're happily willing to spend the money they exchange
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:04.160]  is bad when, and if they think they're making money by keeping the five gigabyte tier for
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:10.380]  free, because X, 50% more people year over year are willing to pay for something, some
[02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:17.720]  level of storage, there are still untold millions of customers who are never going to pay a
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:24.040]  dollar for iCloud storage, who now have photos and videos that aren't getting backed up at
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:32.720]  all. And that is, that is worse for those customers than this extra couple of billion
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:38.460]  dollars is for Apple as a company. And I know that sounds, I, again, I always make the joke
[02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:42.900]  that this show specializes, you know, should be subtitled spending Tim Cook's money, but
[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:48.940]  I really do believe that, that, you know, there's, it's, it's just antithetical to Apple's
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:52.700]  brand to pinch every penny or try to milk every dollar they can out of something. It's
[02:34:52.700 --> 02:35:00.560]  just not, it's not them. Hmm. Well, there's, there's our, there's our bad news. We got
[02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:04.120]  to wrap up soon. This has been going on for a while. Do you want to do something short
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:10.680]  on T-Mobile and Sprint merging, which is really an acquisition. It is an acquisition, which
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:14.320]  is interesting because when they tried to do it a few years ago, it was actually Sprint
[02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:19.160]  trying to buy T-Mobile. But it's, it's, I mean, it's probably hard to get into in too
[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:23.180]  much depth. I think you said it well on your post and I wrote something similar that the
[02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:28.800]  real question here is, is this going from four carriers to three carriers or is it actually
[02:35:28.800 --> 02:35:33.480]  going from two carriers to three carriers? Yeah. And and I think, you know, I think it
[02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:37.880]  depends on your perspective. If you look backwards, there's no question T-Mobile really shook
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:41.960]  up the industry. Like they, they did cause everyone to lower prices. They, they undid
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:48.640]  the phone subsidy issue and they made a big difference. And there's a great example of
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:54.280]  how competition was a great thing. The real challenge I think is 5g because just transitions
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:58.880]  are expensive in general and 5g is going to be way more expensive than any other transition
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:03.780]  because a core piece of 5g is using what's called millimeter wave spectrum, which has
[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:08.720]  way more bandwidth, but can travel far shorter distance. And so what's going to happen is
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.080]  instead of having, you know, big cell towers that reach out many miles, there's going to
[02:36:13.080 --> 02:36:17.200]  be like antennas everywhere. Like think about every utility pole in the urban area is going
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:22.100]  to have antennas on it for, for 5g. And that's going to be so much more expensive and hard
[02:36:22.100 --> 02:36:28.360]  to build out that both T-Mobile and Sprint are just at a massive, massive, massive disadvantage
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:34.440]  relative to Verizon and AT&T. And, and it's going to be really hard to see them competing
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:39.880]  any meaningful way in 5g if they're not combined. So I'm weaning towards thinking it should
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:45.720]  be allowed, but I can very much respect the argument that it shouldn't and T-Mobile being
[02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:46.720]  evidence of that.
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:50.760]  Yeah. And I think I, and I've been impressed with T-Mobile. T-Mobile is the company where
[02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:55.640]  I had to burn my secondary. I'm on Verizon. We have a Verizon family plan for our iPhones,
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:02.000]  but I have a T-Mobile, a $50 a month T-Mobile account that I use for either secondary iPhones
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.720]  or, you know, I usually keep it in my whatever Android phone is my, let's see what's going
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:14.280]  on with Android at the time. And it's, the service is great. It really is. It's way,
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:19.280]  you know, it's, it's really, you know, it, it, at least in places I go, especially in
[02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:23.960]  Philadelphia, coverage is fine. It's, it's very comparable to Verizon and it really is.
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.760]  It's just 50 bucks a month. It is literally 50, you know, I guess I pay tax, but there's,
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:33.480]  there's no, you know, my Verizon bill, you look at the detail, I hardly ever look at
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.480]  it, but I mean, I just pay the thing, but it is, you know, it's six pages long of, you
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.480]  know, courtesy charges.
[02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:48.280]  Yup. I mean, I, I, I'm from like, I'm from a small town in Wisconsin, so T-Mobile is
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:54.520]  a bit more challenging. I learned my lesson a while ago, but I mean the, the, the, the issue is that,
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:59.320]  you know, at the end of, to your point, like the United States, like it's a fixed size
[02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:04.320]  and the number of large cities are a fixed amount, which means to have equivalent coverage,
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:08.220]  you have to spend the same amount of money. But if you have a half as many subscribers
[02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:13.240]  or in the case of, of sprint, like a third as many subscribers, you have, that means
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:18.360]  you have to charge every subscriber three X more or two X more to, to even break even.
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:24.160]  And, and, and yeah, so it, I think they had a good run, but man, 5G, 5G is going to be
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.880]  a, I think a tough transition for both of them if they're, if they're not.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:33.400]  Yeah. And I still think even, you know, I still think that T-Mobile, even, you know,
[02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:37.080]  as good a run that they've had, and I think, what's his last name, Laguerre, John Laguerre,
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:38.080]  is that how you pronounce it?
[02:38:38.080 --> 02:38:39.080]  Yeah, John Laguerre.
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:40.080]  I think he's been a great.
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:41.080]  I'm not sure how to pronounce it.
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:46.360]  He's been a great CEO. I met him once. I was at, out in San Francisco for an Apple event
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:52.480]  and T-Mobile was having a small event and somehow I got invited. And since I was already
[02:38:52.480 --> 02:38:57.200]  there, I just had to walk like three blocks. I went, you know, it's not like I talked to
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:00.280]  him for a long time or anything, but I mean, it just, he just seems like an interesting
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:05.160]  charismatic guy. And I think what he's done with T-Mobile is really, really interesting.
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.080]  Cause like you said, a couple of years ago, it looked like maybe sprint would buy T-Mobile
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:11.680]  and now it's clearly the other way around. He's staying as the CEO, the brand of the
[02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:16.040]  whole company is nothing. It's T-Mobile is eating sprint and sprints going away, but
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:21.360]  that they're, they're getting, you know, sprints infrastructure and stuff like that. I really
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.480]  do. I think ultimately it was always sort of like there were two, a carriers in, in
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:32.420]  America, the, the duopoly of AT&T and Verizon T-Mobile elevated itself to like a second
[02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:37.560]  tier B carrier, maybe even a B plus carrier. And then sprint has sort of fallen into being
[02:39:37.560 --> 02:39:45.240]  like a C carrier. Right. And I feel like maybe T-Mobile and, and sprint combined could be
[02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:50.760]  like an A minus, you know, it could be a little bit more of a serious, you know, third competitor.
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:53.880]  I really think that that's better for the market. I hope for that.
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:58.600]  Yeah. I mean, the other thing is even with all T-Mobile success, Verizon and AT&T share
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:05.120]  of the market has decreased by 0.5%. It's like, so basically T-Mobile's all their growth
[02:40:05.120 --> 02:40:09.440]  has been taken from sprint. So it's like, there's never been, they've never broken into
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.080]  the AT&T and Verizon market. Again, they, they were able, they showed up the market
[02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:19.720]  such that AT&T, Verizon did drive down prices, you know, so there is like, I'm not denying
[02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:24.080]  that in the slightest, but the other thing is, you know, there's, there's lots of details.
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:30.760]  Like sprint actually owns all this spectrum that is very useful for 5g that, so that would
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:35.360]  be, that's, that's a huge thing for, for, for T-Mobile to, to get a piece of that. And
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:39.600]  yeah, I mean the, and the other thing is if you look at other countries, it's very, you
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:43.480]  know, part of the reason the US mobile market is so expensive and messed up is we almost
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:47.800]  had too much competition in there and no one, not enough carriers could get at scale and
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:52.900]  there's been sort of a longterm roll up, which seems bad, but I mean, you look at like SoftBank,
[02:40:52.900 --> 02:40:58.440]  for example, SoftBank was, is in Japan. It was a third place carrier. They were willing
[02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:02.760]  to give, give into Apple's demands and take the iPhone when Docomo and the other, I can't
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:07.440]  remember their carrier, wouldn't. And, and they shook up the entire market and they shook
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:11.480]  it up when there were only three carriers, right? I mean, it's not like three means no
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:17.380]  competition, particularly in a purely commodity sort of market. Like at the end of the day,
[02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:20.960]  like cell service is cell service. And thanks to Apple, Apple has really broken up that
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:27.640]  market to being just a commodity. And if it's just a commodity, you know, three could certainly
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:33.680]  be sufficient to have a competitive market more so than two. And so if you really do
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:38.320]  think 5G is going to be that hard of a transition, then that, that's probably the strongest argument
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:39.640]  in favor of, of the merger.
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:45.240]  Yep. All right. Anything else you wanted to talk about? Oh, I guess we should, I had a
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:51.760]  big scoop this week on Daring Fireball about the marzipan thing, but, oh, that's, that's
[02:41:51.760 --> 02:41:56.320]  what everyone's probably listening to this podcast. I appreciate, I said everything I
[02:41:56.320 --> 02:42:02.560]  know about it. So I, I guess we should acknowledge it, but I have one, I have one thing to add.
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:06.920]  So the, I was, we were in a stock group where you were kind of hacking out some of these
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:13.000]  details. And it's interesting, like, I guess maybe, maybe I thought this many years ago
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:19.300]  that Apple would like leak, like reset expectations by leaking to you. Right. And, and that clearly
[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:24.760]  did not happen. Like I saw you kind of working this out over, over quite a while, whether
[02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:29.500]  this existed or didn't exist. And, and I don't know, I know there's this, people are never
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:32.940]  going to actually listen and believe that's not the case, but I will attest on your side
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:38.760]  that Apple's not like feeding you PR snippets. And, and, and I think you mentioned this,
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:42.760]  why would they? Because it'd basically be a giveaway. What's the warrant canary or something
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:47.360]  like that? Yeah. Yeah. So the, the accusation, and I don't tell like tons of people do it,
[02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:52.020]  but there's a couple and maybe a lot of people are thinking it is that, okay. Mark Gurman
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:59.780]  comes out with a story in December that says Apple has a secret project called marzipan
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:07.440]  to get, to make it easier to write apps that are universal apps that run on iPhones, iPads,
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:12.040]  and Macs. You make one app, it runs on all three. I wrote about it back then that it's,
[02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.280]  that sounds great on the surface and I can see why people hear that. I think, well, that
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:19.320]  sounds great. That would mean more apps and less work for developers and blah, blah, blah.
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:22.280]  But when you really look at the details, I'm not going to go into it here. I have an article,
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:26.400]  I've read about it, but having a system like the Mac where you have multiple windows and
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:32.480]  a menu bar and a mouse pointer and you don't have a touch screen is, and all sorts of features
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:40.440]  in a Mac OS that, that iOS doesn't have and shouldn't have, you know, it's complicated.
[02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.040]  But let's say everybody's excited about it and Gurman said it might be coming as early
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:50.160]  as this year at WWDC. So a lot of people are excited about this, but technically Gurman's
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:57.000]  at a technical level, what he reported is pretty vague. And as I wrote in my piece this
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.000]  week,
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.840]  And it was vague on the date too. He said it could come this year.
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:02.160]  Yeah. Well, he always covers his apps like that.
[02:44:02.160 --> 02:44:06.240]  No, but it was, it was more than a, it was more than a, of course, Apple which is your
[02:44:06.240 --> 02:44:11.480]  plan. It's like it was embedded in the rumor itself was this is very fuzzy in my opinion.
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:15.520]  That's fair to say. Gurman didn't, Gurman didn't really push the this year thing. But,
[02:44:15.520 --> 02:44:22.240]  but everybody who's excited about it and who has, you know, hopes that this is true and
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:27.520]  that wants, you know, awful lot, for example, there's just an awful lot of developers who
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:34.480]  write iOS code and the main framework for the UI in iOS is called UIKit. And the main
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:40.240]  framework for that on the Mac that dates back to the next era in 1989 is called AppKit.
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:48.280]  AppKit and UIKit sort of serve the same roles. But UIKit because it came out in 2007 is sort
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:53.540]  of like, what would we do with a decade more of experience? What would we do differently?
[02:44:53.540 --> 02:44:57.840]  And UIKit reflects that. And there's a lot of things in UIKit that are nicer or more
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:05.520]  convenient or easier than AppKit. And there's a lot of programmers who rightly or wrongly
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.960]  would like UIKit on the Mac instead of AppKit or as an alternative to AppKit, et cetera.
[02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:13.760]  And so people are reading into this and they're hoping it's coming and, and now they're, they're
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:19.560]  all hyped up. And then I write this article that says, well, I looked, I've looked into
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:26.120]  this and A, nobody who I've spoken to has ever heard of the name Marzipan except from
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:30.240]  Gurman's story, which I'm not insinuating means that Gurman is wrong and that that's
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:37.040]  not a real project. It could be, it could, you know, it certainly could be. I'm just
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:38.040]  saying.
[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:41.160]  But if, but if it was launching in two months, some people would have heard of it.
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:44.800]  Right. It is definitely, it's not launching in two months or if it is, they've kept it
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:51.040]  secret in a way that seems impossible given the way Apple works internally, software engineering.
[02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:52.040]  But I don't-
[02:45:52.040 --> 02:45:56.860]  Not just that, but a feature like this would be so, I mean, probably the caveat is Swift,
[02:45:56.860 --> 02:46:01.620]  but the thing with Swift is that was a new to the world thing that didn't really impact
[02:46:01.620 --> 02:46:02.620]  the old stuff.
[02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:03.620]  Yes.
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:07.780]  Whereas it seems like this would be, it's going to touch so many things within the company
[02:46:07.780 --> 02:46:11.960]  that it's not like you can just surprise everyone.
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:14.340]  I think so. You know, I guess-
[02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.440]  But Swift is the counter example, right? No one saw Swift coming.
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:22.320]  Nobody. It was a very small number of people and very small number of people within Apple
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:30.320]  who knew about it before the keynote. But I've heard of a different project with a different
[02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:35.680]  code name. And one of the things people are saying now that there's this story that came
[02:46:35.680 --> 02:46:39.840]  out about Apple having these, identified all these people who leaked. A lot of people have
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:43.680]  said to me, well, maybe some people were told Marzipan and some people were told this other
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:47.040]  name and some people were told another name. And then when the name Marzipan came out,
[02:46:47.040 --> 02:46:51.320]  they knew it came from this group because that's what they were told the name is. Nobody
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:56.040]  at Apple who I've ever spoken to has ever heard of a single project having multiple
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:58.480]  code names for that reason. They might-
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:46:59.880]  It defeats the purpose of a code name.
[02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:01.080]  It does. It totally does.
[02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:04.360]  The reason I have a code name is to communicate, is to talk about the project.
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:09.400]  Right. The UI project I've heard of, which I described in my article, it's a declarative
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:16.360]  UI framework where it's just a different way to make a UI. And it is cross platform for
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:28.920]  iOS and Mac. And I believe now it's also Watch and maybe even TV, but definitely Watch, has
[02:47:28.920 --> 02:47:34.680]  a different code name, which I don't want to reveal because it hasn't leaked. But it's
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:41.900]  not coming at WWDC. So the thing I know about is not coming at WWDC this year. Is there
[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:47.560]  possibly a different thing that has some kind of run iPhone apps on Mac and it is called
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:53.880]  Marzipan and I just don't know anybody who's ever heard of it and it's not anywhere listed
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:48:02.400]  in radar internally in Apple. Possible. But I think if that were coming this year, I would
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:07.000]  have people who know about it. So I don't think that's coming at WWDC this year either.
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:11.360]  And so the speculation like what you're alluding to is, okay, Apple sees that there's lots
[02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:18.320]  of people who think something big and exciting along this line is coming next month. They
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.200]  don't want people to be disappointed when the keynote comes and goes and it doesn't
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:29.440]  appear. So somebody from Apple PR, you know, picks up the phone, calls me and lets me know
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:34.600]  that I can't say that Apple PR told me this, but I, you know, maybe I would want to dampen
[02:48:34.600 --> 02:48:39.520]  expectations or something like that. It seems like a lot of people think that's what happened
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:44.600]  and that is not what happened at all and has never actually happened. I do have contact
[02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:49.440]  with Apple PR on a regular basis. Sometimes I contact them to ask questions. Sometimes
[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:54.280]  they come to me with information, but I've been thinking about it the last few days.
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:58.680]  To my recollection in my entire history of interaction with Apple PR, I don't think I've
[02:48:58.680 --> 02:49:04.880]  ever been contacted by Apple PR regarding a rumor. Even something that, you know, like
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:11.360]  this, where if the rumor doesn't pan out, people are going to be disappointed. And like
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:15.280]  you said, it's like the warrant canary. I think the reason they don't do that is if
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:22.160]  they started reaching out to me or anyone else to dampen expectations for false rumors
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:27.120]  or let's say, maybe not even false, but like a true rumor whose deadline has come and gone,
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:32.600]  you know, is going to slip. If they start doing that, then when they don't do it, like
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:37.360]  a rumor that X is coming at WWDC and they don't dampen the expectations, well then it
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:44.680]  just sort of verifies in advance that that's true. So they don't do that. I've, everything
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:52.040]  I found out about this project was through, as I call them, ground level sources, engineers,
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:50:00.280]  I guess in this case, all engineers working throughout Apple. I laugh, but it's, you know,
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:04.160]  I guess it's not a most unreasonable theory. And the funny thing is I get accused of this,
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:08.680]  you know, multiple times. Not even accusation, but I guess just the idea that this stuff
[02:50:08.680 --> 02:50:13.520]  is spoon fed. And then I'll say sometimes, I'll publicly, like I am right now on this
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:17.160]  podcast, but I'll say it on Twitter that no, my sources for this are all ground level,
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:20.680]  either engineers or designers or something like that. And then the people who cannot
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:25.440]  be shaken from this, like the conspiracy theory that I, the Apple PR just funnels stuff through
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:30.760]  this through me. And I just, you know, put it out there. They say, well, who do you think
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:37.000]  told them to tell you Apple PR? And it's like, no, that is definitely not how it works. Apple
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:42.680]  PR doesn't go, I just imagine, Apple PR doesn't trust Apple PR doesn't trust Apple employees
[02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:47.120]  as far as they can throw. They're not going to trust them to pass on messages to journalists.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:53.120]  No, but think about this. Think about if you're an engineer working on a UI kit and you're,
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:59.640]  you know, cracking away on something for iOS 12, right. And you know, deadlines coming
[02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:05.680]  up, you're working hard and someone from Apple PR comes by your office. Knock, knock. Hey
[02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:12.440]  Ben. Hey, here's what we'd like you to do. Reach out to John Gruber and let them know
[02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:17.680]  that in a way that we can't control and can't trace. And let them know that, yeah. You ever,
[02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.880]  you see that thing about this quote unquote marzipan thing. You know, you know that. Yeah.
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:27.280]  Tell them that's not, that's not happening in June. No, they just, they would just, if
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:32.600]  they were going to do it, they would literally just call me and, and talk to me. But that
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:37.480]  that's never happened. And for good reason, they, they, you know, they're the only same
[02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:41.600]  way for them to deal with rumors is to never acknowledge them in any way, no matter how
[02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:48.080]  false. I mean, they have, I think they do via like the wall street journal, right? What
[02:51:48.080 --> 02:51:54.080]  was that big one a few years ago? The one that I remember was the $999 starting price
[02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:58.040]  for the original iPad. Oh, that's right. Cause it was in the opposite direction. They actually
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:03.160]  spread a false rumor. That's what we think. No, I've never heard anybody say what happened.
[02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:09.240]  I would love to know. I don't remember the byline on that story and who got it. It was,
[02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:14.480]  it was Cain, wasn't it? I think it might've been, uh, I think it might've been, I didn't
[02:52:14.480 --> 02:52:19.440]  want, I didn't want to butcher the times. I don't know that that's ever happened either.
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:26.280]  But the times when like, I think it, they might have Apple PR might have strategically
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:32.240]  at them from the highest executive levels of the company strategically leaked something.
[02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:39.200]  They, every time I think it might've happened, it has always and only ever been to straight
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:49.680]  reporters on the Apple beat at major news organizations. Generally only the New York
[02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:55.000]  Times and wall street journal that they'll, they, they will give something, you know,
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:03.080]  it seems like sometimes they might give something like a expectation setting sources familiar
[02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:07.240]  with the matter leak. But what I, what I mean by straight reporter is somebody who doesn't
[02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:11.880]  write like I do, like as a, the under, you know, with a, like a columnist with a voice
[02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:17.240]  and opinion, somebody who's just a straight front of the newspaper, front page of the
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:24.360]  newspaper reporter, you know, who writes in that sort of objective, uh, from that objective
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:30.080]  perspective as a reporter. That's the only time I think they'd ever, they ever have might've
[02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:32.840]  ever done it. And even then, I'm not sure they ever have.
[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:38.000]  Yeah, no, there, there's, um, yeah, there's definitely been ones where they've, they've
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:42.460]  tamped expectations down. Like I think there was one about there being no new hardware
[02:53:42.460 --> 02:53:48.040]  at WWDC a couple of years ago. Um, uh, that was in the wall street journal or something
[02:53:48.040 --> 02:53:53.760]  like that. Um, I don't know. I, I feel like it has been done, but you're right. Like the
[02:53:53.760 --> 02:53:58.840]  vector is a very well established one, right? I think it is actually almost always the wall
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:01.800]  street journal. I don't even remember there being one in the New York Times. I think it's,
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:05.120]  the wall street journal will report something. Apple's going to happen. It's like two weeks
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:08.880]  before an event and it's, it's managing expectations.
[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:15.000]  And even the, even the no new hardware at WWDC isn't necessarily regarding any specific
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:20.800]  rumor. You know, it's just setting expectations overall, you know, right. The one I remember
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:28.280]  that didn't happen and it was a like a warrant canary was the original iPhone, uh, in January
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:37.100]  of 2007 because what had leaked was just period. Apple is building a phone, right? And you
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:42.800]  know how it leaked. It leaked from the goddamn carriers who Apple had to talk to. Um, and
[02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:47.360]  you know, with good reason, you know, it proved to be good reason why Apple didn't show them
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:51.800]  the iPhone because they would have fucking blabbed about that too. Um, but the fact that
[02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:57.760]  Apple was building a phone wasn't quite knowledge, but it was, you know, everybody believed it
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:03.520]  was true and everybody, everyone was expecting a phone that day. Yeah. And everybody, yeah,
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:07.240]  everybody was expecting a phone that day. And I remember getting there. So Mac world
[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:12.440]  expos started on, I think it started on a Monday, but whatever the day before it was,
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:19.040]  I got to San Francisco and uh, I was walking down market street and I saw James Duncan
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:25.800]  Davidson, uh, uh, outside a coffee shop and I knew, and I was, Hey, and we sat down and
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:31.720]  we were talking about it and we were like, uh, we didn't have phones. It's so funny.
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.000]  We didn't have phones to check, but we were talking about how we kept like reloading news
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:38.480]  sites to see if anything came out, like to say, Hey, there's not going to be a phone
[02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:43.360]  tomorrow. Cause it was so rampant that Apple was going to the belief that Apple was going
[02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:49.440]  to announce a phone that nobody knew anything about. Uh, and the fact that nobody, not the
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.840]  wall street journal, not the new, nobody had any kind of thing that, that said otherwise
[02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:58.400]  it was like, I think this is definitely going to happen. I remember talking with Duncan
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:02.560]  about it. We were like, we talked to ourselves, we, we started like drinking coffee thinking
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:06.040]  like this is, they're not built, they're not going to do a phone. And by the end of it,
[02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:10.920]  just the fact that they hadn't refuted it or, or tampened expectations that there'd
[02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:16.520]  be a phone that the Apple was dead silent on or off the record about the phone. Uh,
[02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:21.000]  a phone, we were convinced by the end of the conversation that we were willing to bet money
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:25.320]  that there was some kind of phone, probably an iPod phone coming out the next day.
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:32.200]  Yeah. And if you think about the presentation, uh, jobs really leveraged that fact that everyone
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:36.760]  was expecting a phone, right? That's why the we're announcing three products today was,
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:40.960]  was so effective. And he gets to the right way today to be able meant to stay. I was like,
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:43.480]  Oh, it's going to be a phone and we're announcing three products. Oh, there are,
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:49.880]  it's going to be a phone and what else? But like he, so he built that presentation knowing
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:54.280]  that everyone knew they were announcing a phone, which is part of what made the presentations,
[02:56:54.280 --> 02:57:03.640]  you know, so brilliant. Right. It was, uh, a widescreen video, iPod, a breakthrough internet
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:10.440]  communication device and revolutionary and a revolutionary phone, right? Yeah. It was, uh,
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:17.080]  something like that. Yeah. It was a widescreen video player and breakthrough, breakthrough
[02:57:17.080 --> 02:57:23.640]  internet communication device and a, and a revolutionary phone. Yup. And I bought it.
[02:57:24.760 --> 02:57:28.120]  No one, no one cheered for the revolutionary internet community or the breakthrough
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:32.280]  communicator. I was like, yeah, it was cheer, cheer. Oh yeah. I remember thinking,
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:35.720]  but I remember thinking that's the part that I remember. I remember thinking in the audience,
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:39.000]  like what the hell are they talking about with that? Like I got it. Like the two,
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.440]  two of the three I got, I was like, okay, widescreen video, iPod. Yeah. Because the
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:45.480]  iPods that played video at the time didn't have big enough screens where I was like,
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:50.120]  oh, I bet the whole thing will be a screen. Like I, I, when he said that, I, I really did think
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:54.840]  like something roughly like what the iPhone form factor was, but I, I just thought, you know,
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:57:58.200]  I didn't think it would be a touch screen. I just figured it would, they just use the
[02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:03.080]  whole thing, you know, have like little buttons at the bottom for play pause. And you know,
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:09.400]  it's very funny, but anyway, I did not, I don't think Apple, I don't think Apple really gives
[02:58:09.400 --> 02:58:15.800]  two shits what I write about the marzipan thing, honestly, because it's all along.
[02:58:17.080 --> 02:58:24.120]  Well, the other thing to keep in mind is that and I mean that sincerely, I know I'm saying that
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:28.680]  Apple PR doesn't care what I write about. I think they do. I think, you know, I'm not trying to
[02:58:28.680 --> 02:58:33.640]  brag. I'm actually, you know, I'm just trying to acknowledge the obvious that I, I'm what I write
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:39.320]  is influential about Apple, but on this marzipan thing in particular, it's too easy to get for us
[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:45.560]  and the people who like listen to the show to get caught up thinking about that. What we care about
[02:58:45.560 --> 02:58:52.600]  a cross-platform UI layer that would bridge iOS to Mac, like people listening to the show, we care
[02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:56.200]  about that. That's big news. There might be a lot of people listening to show her are going to be
[02:58:56.200 --> 02:59:00.600]  disappointed if what I wrote this week is correct and WWDC comes and goes, and that doesn't get
[02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:06.280]  announced. But in terms of like the real world, that's what I just said was gibberish, right?
[02:59:06.280 --> 02:59:13.480]  99% of all people who own an iPhone have no idea what the hell a cross-platform UI layer between
[02:59:13.480 --> 02:59:20.280]  UIKit and AppKit is. No idea. They don't care. I've just started speaking Greek to them. So,
[02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:24.920]  the type of rumors that Apple really cares about are the type of things that actually affect,
[02:59:24.920 --> 02:59:30.440]  you know, 99% of people. The type of thing that would get on the front page of newspapers the
[02:59:30.440 --> 02:59:38.360]  next day, right? Let's say- Well, one could say that that's why this Marzipan rumor, they would
[02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:43.800]  leak to you instead of the Wall Street Journal because the people that do care read you. So,
[02:59:44.520 --> 02:59:48.920]  you might have just undone the case against yourself. We can't. There's no way to refuse,
[02:59:48.920 --> 02:59:55.000]  no way. You're right. There's no way to get out of this. Well, all I can say is you have to take
[02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:03.880]  me at my word. Well, I do. And as all long podcasts that are not only about Apple must do,
[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:07.640]  we managed to circle back to the Steve Jobs iPhone introduction keynote. So,
[03:00:07.640 --> 03:00:13.800]  I think we have accomplished our mission here. All right. Thank you so much, Ben. It is always
[03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:19.320]  a pleasure to have you on the show. I'm deeply disappointed that we can't get together and watch
[03:00:19.320 --> 03:00:25.000]  Sixers-Bucks playoff games this year. But I do have the- Hey, I told you, if the Sixers go to the
[03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:31.480]  finals, I've gotten two finals games in the last two years. And if the Warriors make it, I plan to
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:34.520]  make it a third. And if the Sixers make it- Well, you've already said the Warriors are going to win
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.840]  the whole thing. So, the Warriors will be there. If they're playing the Sixers, it would be very
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:46.040]  hard to not go to see them play over at the, what do they call the place? Oracle. The Oracle.
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:53.880]  Oracle arena. The Oracle orifice. That's right. Everybody can find out more about your writing.
[03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:56.760]  I mean, I can't believe there's anybody listening who isn't already a subscriber,
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:04.600]  but at stratechery.com, which has a, I should mention, a redesign, a visual branding redesign,
[03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:10.760]  a new website, a new logo that has launched in between the time you were last on the show.
[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:18.200]  And now I cannot let it go without complimenting you on an excellent, excellent redesign that I
[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:22.280]  enjoy every single- I think about it every single day when I look at the newsletter in my email,
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:27.720]  and I think, but damn, that looks good. Well, thank you. And credit to Brad Ellis,
[03:01:27.720 --> 03:01:32.760]  who made the logo mark. But yeah, not just the redesign, but also if you go there, you can now,
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:36.360]  much easier way to sort of get access to the archives. Search is dramatically enhanced. And
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:42.120]  then being able to sort of browse the site by organized by concept or company or topic.
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:48.200]  The, that was really the, there's the ultimate goal was to get the access to what I've written
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:53.720]  before easier and whatnot. But because humans are humans and we care about visual things,
[03:01:53.720 --> 03:01:58.600]  adding on a new logo made it all look nice. Yeah. I even liked the way, and at first I didn't
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:03.640]  like it, but I like the way on the homepage now where the, it's like the subscriber's daily
[03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:09.240]  update, you get up, they're all the most recent four are all at the top. And it is,
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:13.400]  it's sort of like it, I like it. I didn't like it at first. I thought, ah, the new article should
[03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:18.440]  be the first thing on the page, but I like this because it fits in with the idea of it's like
[03:02:18.440 --> 03:02:22.520]  respect for like a subscriber who's not a daily reader. Like you're a subscriber, you're going to
[03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:26.200]  read it at least every week, but here, if you want to just catch up, click, click, click, you could
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:30.920]  open these four things and tabs and there they are. Well, the other thing that, the other thing
[03:02:30.920 --> 03:02:36.120]  that, the other thing that I do that if you go to a single article, like you follow link on Twitter,
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.840]  you'll notice that those articles are not on the top. Now they're at the very bottom of the page.
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:44.040]  And the reason is if you're following a link to an article, you probably want to read the article.
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:48.840]  So I want to get the other crap out of your way. And then when you get to the end and you know,
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:54.360]  because I don't really push this subscription at all. It's, I mean, but like it's there,
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:59.720]  but I'm not going to like shove it in your face. And, and I, you know, I, ideally you read
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:03.240]  the free articles regularly and then eventually you're tempted to give the,
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:07.160]  the four pay stuff a try. And then I got a, I got a month to hook you.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:12.840]  Well, it's as good as ever. And it's been, it's been a particularly good week, in my opinion,
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:18.040]  with the stuff on Amazon and Apple and, and et cetera and so forth. So thanks. And then you've
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:22.440]  also got, if the people enjoy your sound of your voice, you've got your regular podcast,
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:31.560]  Exponent, exponent.fm, with your co-host, James Allward. Have you, have you moved the talk show
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:38.360]  to, oh, you're hosted on your own site. So you, you already switched to HTTPS. Yes. I got to,
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:45.480]  I need to switch Exponent to HTTPS. Yeah. That's like the only, there's more coming,
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:52.120]  uh, literally I'm in the midst, I've actually broken the seal. It's we're moving to a new server
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:58.360]  soon. Uh, but HTTPS was HTTPS for everything is probably the only modernization I've done
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:03.880]  to during Fireball in the last couple of years, but it is all HTTPS. I watched with, um, yeah,
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:08.760]  I watched the HTTPS on trajectory, which was, uh, one, it was just sort of best practice at the
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:13.400]  time, but two, you know, I knew I wanted to monetize it at some point, but the, I mean,
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:18.040]  the podcast, like why bother? Uh, but now this, I think in Chrome or at least the newest version,
[03:04:19.240 --> 03:04:24.040]  Google has turned on the, this site is dangerous, which is a little over the top, but, but yeah.
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:27.000]  Yeah. I don't like it. I think it's a bad move on Google's part. I don't,
[03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:33.400]  uh, I'm not, I don't really buy the argument that everything should be HTTPS. Uh,
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:37.480]  I don't think it hurts. It's a perfect example of the way why there is no reason that that
[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:43.480]  exponent needs to be the issue. But, uh, you know, and during Fireballs, a reasonable example,
[03:04:43.480 --> 03:04:47.720]  I don't have user accounts. There's no, you know, it's still better that it's,
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:53.320]  you know, it's better for some reasons, but it's not a big deal. And for downloading a podcast,
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:05:00.600]  I mean, who gives a crap, honestly, I mean, but what do I know? Alas,
[03:05:00.600 --> 03:05:07.240]  anyway, great job on the redesign, the Brad Ellis, a friend of mine to, uh,
[03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:13.160]  a very talented designer and, and he really nailed it. I love the, the mark of the, uh,
[03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:20.360]  the pen. That's also a circuit is so it's, God, it's, that's really good. I think I told you this,
[03:05:20.360 --> 03:05:23.160]  I think I told you this privately, but it's good enough that it makes me jealous.
[03:05:25.160 --> 03:05:29.640]  Hey, well, well, I mean, you, you, you, you called your site during Fireball called
[03:05:29.640 --> 03:05:32.360]  master checkers. I think you're going to have a break until the end of the time.
[03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:36.600]  All right. Thanks, Ben. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. Have a good day.
[03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:46.200]  This new innovative modular design provides a full upgrade path. This means that a customer
[03:05:46.200 --> 03:05:51.720]  can purchase an entry-level laser printer. Knowing that when the business demands more performance,
[03:05:51.720 --> 03:05:56.680]  the laser rider can be upgraded without loss of the original investment made in the engine.
[03:05:56.680 --> 03:06:02.760]  Also the new second generation engine has a maximum expected lifetime three times longer
[03:06:02.760 --> 03:06:10.280]  than before. Other important benefits are a longer lasting replaceable toner cartridge system
[03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:15.000]  that offers darker blacks while retaining the crisp characters and graphics. The previous
[03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:22.200]  laser writers have been known for a 200 page input tray, including an optional envelope cassette
[03:06:22.200 --> 03:06:28.360]  and face down or face up output trays, which provide enhanced paper handling capabilities,
[03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:35.000]  upgrade ability, and the improved design and components of the laser rider to
[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:41.240]  printer engine offer customers flexibility and a significant price performance improvement
[03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:48.680]  over Apple's previous laser writers. The laser rider two MTX, the laser rider two MT,
[03:06:48.680 --> 03:06:56.600]  and the laser rider two SC. Three unique printers at three price points capable of satisfying a
[03:06:56.600 --> 03:07:02.920]  broad range of customer needs from general office productivity to high-end desktop publishing.
[03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:18.920]  With the laser rider two family of printers, Apple demonstrates their commitment to extending the lead.
