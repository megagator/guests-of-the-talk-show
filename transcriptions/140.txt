[00:00.000 --> 00:07.980]  Did you get anything good for the Christmas art of Star Wars a force awakens which I already recommended and is really good
[00:08.340 --> 00:14.960]  What was that what's that that's a quotation shows all the design process. Yeah, the shows the design process. They went through which I always find fascinating
[00:16.360 --> 00:19.160]  It seems how did they make the book how is the book already out?
[00:20.400 --> 00:24.880]  Well, they showed stuff that they've been working on for years and years like early concepts for the movies and designs
[00:24.880 --> 00:31.440]  They did and things that changed an awful lot and stuff that Jay that Abrams would come back and forth while he was working on Star Trek to to kibbutz about
[00:33.720 --> 00:35.720]  Kibbutz I would say kibbutz
[00:36.960 --> 00:40.720]  My wrong, I don't know. I probably got a little bit of yiddish in mind
[00:43.960 --> 00:45.960]  So like what changed
[00:45.960 --> 00:53.280]  I don't want to go I've only just started it because I've gotten so not used to looking at physical media anymore that it's a slow reading process for me
[00:53.280 --> 01:00.600]  But a lot of the early designs were just very different and just when the way they look and some of the character ideas that they had
[01:02.400 --> 01:07.240]  I was the feeling that Abrams writes by the seat of his pants, which is not my favorite characteristic of his
[01:08.280 --> 01:13.040]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely I keep saying I don't want to go all Star Wars on this
[01:14.040 --> 01:19.720]  I do think I I mean, that's his reputation. I mean, I don't know personally
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.040]  But I mean, it's certainly his reputation and it's like as one of my friends put it that it's that he
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.760]  inevitably heads into every movie like
[01:28.840 --> 01:32.440]  Production starts with the story 85% written which
[01:33.280 --> 01:37.160]  It's just that's his style, you know, and I don't know that it's ever going to change
[01:37.680 --> 01:41.580]  And you get wonderful set pieces and sometimes the story takes a backseat to them I
[01:43.160 --> 01:48.160]  Did like a force the force awakens though. I don't want to leave people without that I mean
[01:48.160 --> 01:50.720]  And I've seen it four times. I love the damn thing
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.200]  Would you've gone seeing it four times anyway? I mean you really like it that much?
[01:55.200 --> 01:57.200]  I've seen it twice. I can't watch the prequels again
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.360]  I I'm in ability to well I can watch movies a lot and I can't watch the prequels or or
[02:01.520 --> 02:03.360]  Manisteal movies like that. I just can't watch again
[02:03.360 --> 02:06.840]  So this to me it has to be a good good Star Wars we don't watch it at repeatedly
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.720]  May I steal it again? I don't understand how that movie I don't understand how that movie got made
[02:13.720 --> 02:20.520]  I they don't have a Kevin Fehey who just oversees DC's property is no one no one gives a shit, right?
[02:20.520 --> 02:24.640]  It's like you somehow run that up the chain at Warner Brothers
[02:25.480 --> 02:27.480]  Which is like where it ultimately falls right?
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.040]  Act three he's gonna heat vision a bunch of Kryptonian babies. Okay. Go for it
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.800]  I mean, it's it's not a terrible movie, but it's not
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.440]  Superman, you know what I mean, and
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.800]  Yeah, the whole idea of shooting it with that incredibly
[02:44.680 --> 02:45.960]  weird
[02:45.960 --> 02:48.680]  Color palette is so bizarre to me. I
[02:49.400 --> 02:55.080]  Don't understand how they have Superman versus Batman which might be a good movie, but it's as dark and dreary as the suicide squad
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.800]  So I I don't know how you have Joker in the world where Superman might as well be the Joker. It's just it's a very odd job to position
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.080]  Yeah, I mean, there were definitely some good moments in the movie, but it's
[03:03.080 --> 03:09.160]  I don't know anyway for some weekends. I liked it a lot. You know, I have some complaints. I don't love it
[03:11.240 --> 03:16.680]  But and again, I don't think that this is this is no spoiler. Yeah, again, I've you know
[03:16.680 --> 03:23.720]  You leave your ears open if you haven't seen it yet, but you should you should definitely go see it before you listen to the next episode of the talk show
[03:24.360 --> 03:28.760]  I feel like with this one. I feel like like with for example like with specter
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.200]  I'll be very very cognizant of spoilers because I don't know that everybody goes to see it right away
[03:34.200 --> 03:37.960]  I feel like with Star Wars you're sort of under an obligation where if you haven't seen it by
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.120]  Say the end of the calendar year then it's on you if you're talking about spoilers
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.800]  I will just say that this was a Star Wars movie to me and the other ones weren't so this to me is like the first real Star Wars movie
[03:49.800 --> 03:51.800]  We've had an almost 40 years. Yeah
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.120]  Definitely. I felt like it. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I'm not a prequel hater
[03:56.120 --> 04:03.160]  But I did I only want to rewatch coming up to this was because I watched them all a lot with my son when he was younger
[04:04.280 --> 04:09.080]  So I'm I've seen the prequels a ton of times just because he liked all of the Star Wars movies
[04:09.880 --> 04:16.200]  And I didn't hate any of them even the Phantom Men menace. I didn't hate I mean obviously had a lot of complaints with it
[04:16.200 --> 04:17.640]  but I
[04:17.640 --> 04:22.840]  Didn't hate it and never redeemable moments in all of them or enjoyable moments in all of them
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.600]  Um, but the one that I definitely thought I liked the best was
[04:27.560 --> 04:31.640]  Revenge of the Sith and so I rewatch that one before watching the
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.960]  Despecialized editions of the original trilogy before seeing this and even that one
[04:38.840 --> 04:43.880]  Was even it gets worse as time goes on like I had a theory is that
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.000]  The prequels and the special edition are George Lucas's punishment to us for liking Star Wars more than him
[04:49.000 --> 04:56.600]  I am I'm so baffled that those movies came that's one of the things and
[04:58.600 --> 05:04.120]  I know I've said this before, but it's like I feel like the the prequels
[05:05.480 --> 05:09.080]  As they are without changing one thing about them
[05:09.800 --> 05:13.480]  Make sense in a universe where George Lucas
[05:13.480 --> 05:21.000]  Didn't control Star Wars or had sold control of Star Wars in the early 90s guys at DC comics and it's yeah
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.600]  And something like that happened like DC you know Warner Brothers and DC comics or you know some idiots at Fox
[05:28.840 --> 05:33.000]  Did this and it's like ah what a crying shame, you know what they've done
[05:33.880 --> 05:36.360]  It's baffling that he had complete
[05:36.360 --> 05:45.880]  Authorial control over the whole thing and that the guy who came up with you know, and deservedly so gets all the credit in the world for the original trilogy
[05:47.560 --> 05:53.320]  That he hit that it was him who did this and you know that there's no indication that he was ever
[05:54.040 --> 05:56.920]  You know suffered any kind of severe head injury or
[05:59.080 --> 06:03.560]  He wanted to do his experimental films and I think he kind of thinks we didn't let him because of Star Wars
[06:03.560 --> 06:06.200]  He wasn't allowed to make the experimental films. They really wanted to make
[06:07.960 --> 06:13.160]  That's the thing. I don't know if people know this, but it's like he that's really who George Lucas was and if you look at like
[06:13.240 --> 06:22.120]  THX 1138 or even like the student version of it before it they were really really I mean their true art films in the 60s and 70s sense
[06:25.160 --> 06:27.160]  But but that's not
[06:27.160 --> 06:33.480]  I don't know yeah, I feel like he really likes the prequels. I really do when you listen to him talk
[06:33.480 --> 06:39.080]  I don't think that he was spiteful. I feel like that's what he somehow that's what he decided he wanted to make
[06:39.400 --> 06:46.520]  But anyway, it doesn't hold up well, and I also would say most is incredibly to me is that the effects really don't hold up
[06:47.080 --> 06:49.080]  and especially in the
[06:49.960 --> 06:55.080]  Well, I didn't watch the other two recently, but when I rewatched the Blu-ray version of
[06:55.080 --> 06:57.160]  Revenge of the Sith
[06:57.880 --> 07:03.080]  I was really kind of startled because it had been several years since I'd seen it and it I was really startled
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.560]  But at how poorly I thought the effects held up overall
[07:05.960 --> 07:08.200]  But then when you watch because I did the same thing as you I watched the
[07:08.200 --> 07:11.960]  Despecialized editions right before going to see the Force Awakens and those effects hold up great
[07:12.360 --> 07:16.920]  Yeah, I mean you can definitely even the ones where you know like you can kind of see that it's not real
[07:16.920 --> 07:18.920]  Maybe the stop motion on
[07:19.720 --> 07:22.040]  Like a walker or something isn't white
[07:22.040 --> 07:28.040]  It isn't quite right, but it yeah, it the way that it fails
[07:28.280 --> 07:30.280]  It doesn't get worse as time goes on
[07:30.600 --> 07:38.040]  Like it it it fails in a way that it failed right when they came out, you know or or you know gets to like the 98 99% marker
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.600]  And there's a certain charm to it
[07:41.560 --> 07:43.560]  No, absolutely
[07:43.800 --> 07:49.240]  I think the biggest thing that really strikes me about the the prequel trilogy effects wise is
[07:49.240 --> 07:51.240]  is
[07:51.720 --> 07:54.680]  The the
[07:54.680 --> 08:01.960]  Uncanny Valley of the almost the fact that almost everything was shot against the green screen and I almost the cartoon
[08:02.680 --> 08:08.520]  You can pause any scene and and just like the most mundane things like you know
[08:08.920 --> 08:12.600]  They've a meeting in Palpatine's office
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.520]  It's like they're just having a meeting in an office
[08:16.520 --> 08:21.800]  And I mean, you know, we could go on and on and on about this and talk about how the fact that how so many of the scenes for
[08:22.040 --> 08:29.960]  Meetings in Palpatine's office. Yes a problem. The whole thing shots just sitting on so fast, but it just it and I keep you can freeze frame
[08:30.120 --> 08:34.600]  You know pause the thing and I I can't look at it and and articulate
[08:35.240 --> 08:40.680]  Logically what it is that looks phony to me about it. I can't I don't know what it is
[08:40.680 --> 08:45.560]  It's but it's there's something there is something to the whole thing where it just looks like you know
[08:45.560 --> 08:50.760]  Yeah, like an inverse version of Roger Rabbit. You've got all these real people in a
[08:51.320 --> 08:52.920]  cartoon world
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.600]  Yeah, it hurt us. It reminds me of something you and Merlin did a talk a long time ago
[08:56.600 --> 09:03.080]  It's held by Southwest that I always loved and it reminds me of what went wrong with George Lucas is that he he lost his inner
[09:03.080 --> 09:04.840]  Editor and he lost his external editor, too
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.040]  He just there was no one to tell him yes and no
[09:08.040 --> 09:11.760]  No one that had the authority through that at least he was just surrounded by enablers
[09:11.760 --> 09:15.680]  And you can never do great work when people around you are just saying yeah, that's great all the time
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.600]  Yeah, do we mention Lucas in particular at that talk? No, it was just about it was just about the craft of writing
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.800]  Yeah, but it's definitely true. I'll put a link in the show notes
[09:25.760 --> 09:28.160]  It's probably the high water mark of my public speaking career
[09:29.760 --> 09:31.760]  It was an awesome talk
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.160]  It was I think I've said this before, too
[09:36.160 --> 09:40.000]  Like Merlin and I had this talk planned and we we had met the day before
[09:40.000 --> 09:45.600]  In his hotel room down in Austin and we had a whole talk planned and then we were going on in the afternoon
[09:45.600 --> 09:53.520]  And the next day in the morning we met again to go over it and we decided that it was total total rubbish and it was a terrible idea
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.800]  And so we ripped it up and we decided to do a different talk and at this point
[10:01.760 --> 10:04.960]  We were like 90 minutes away from going on stage and
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.480]  And or not like when we decided to do that but like when we had completed like a draft of it
[10:10.480 --> 10:15.120]  And we're like well, let's run through it once and we ran through it once and it took like 45 minutes 50 minutes
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.800]  And we're like oh my god. That was awful. That was even worse and we're like what do we do?
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.920]  Do we go back to the one we threw away or do we try to make do with this and we're like oh shit
[10:23.920 --> 10:27.520]  We don't even know we don't have chance we know we only had 30 minutes before we went on stage
[10:27.520 --> 10:29.040]  And we're like this is gonna be terrible
[10:29.040 --> 10:33.360]  And then we're like well to hell with it. It's just a panel itself by Southwest and so we went with the plan
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.480]  You know the new one and the second time we did it in front of the audience as soon as we finished we looked at each other
[10:38.480 --> 10:40.480]  like wow that was great and
[10:41.280 --> 10:47.280]  Ever since I think more more than any other public speaking thing I've ever done in my life people come up to me
[10:47.280 --> 10:49.280]  Still now and say that was that was pretty good
[10:50.160 --> 10:53.520]  Yeah, it was it was not standing talk people should go listen to it if they haven't already
[10:53.520 --> 11:01.520]  I'm not sure what the advice is though. I feel like I'm giving people the advice that if you ever do a run-through of a talk and it's terrible
[11:03.360 --> 11:07.040]  Stop be from the heart John. It's what you're all set. You're ready to go go on stage
[11:07.920 --> 11:11.920]  Let me start anyway, the whole reason we hear is we're gonna talk your interview here
[11:11.920 --> 11:15.920]  We are at the end of of 2015. We did that you and I did this last year on the show. I thought it was great
[11:17.440 --> 11:22.080]  I this is gonna be we shouldn't have wasted any time on the movie talk because there's a lot to talk about
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.440]  Yeah, and that's and you're in review. Let's mostly focused on Apple Apple's you're in review
[11:29.920 --> 11:32.960]  But before we get started on that why don't I take our first break and thank
[11:33.680 --> 11:36.080]  One of the great sponsors all year long
[11:36.640 --> 11:42.240]  They've been with us on the show our good friends at Harry's Harry's offers high quality
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.720]  Razors and blades and other shaving products for a fraction of the price of the big razor brand brands
[11:48.720 --> 11:55.760]  We started by just two guys and they just wanted a better product without paying an arm and a leg didn't make any sense to them that
[11:57.680 --> 12:01.760]  Regular razor blade you buy in the drugstore the good ones cost as much as they did
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.720]  So they started to make their own blades
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.920]  They procured them from an old blade factory that's been operating in Germany for a long time
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.840]  They raised money once they liked the quality so much they actually bought it
[12:13.840 --> 12:21.760]  So Harry's owns their own razor factory over in Germany. They've been it's a factory that's been producing high quality blades for I don't know decades
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.520]  That's how they offer high quality at an amazing price is they own the factory they
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.800]  Sell direct to you. You just go to the website and there's no middleman involved
[12:36.240 --> 12:41.920]  And so you get a great product in amazing packaging truly truly great packaging

[12:53.280 --> 12:56.560]  moisturizing shave cream or gel your your choice and
[12:57.200 --> 12:59.280]  Three razor blades and when you need more blades
[12:59.760 --> 13:07.360]  They are always two dollars each or less and eight pack is just 15 a 16 pack is just 25 etc etc

[13:10.240 --> 13:13.520]  Or if you know how frequently you shave and how frequently you replace the blades

[13:45.280 --> 13:48.640]  So where do we start I say we go what do you say chronological right?
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.560]  Yeah, absolutely. I think like the big thing this year is that for a couple years since 2012
[13:54.560 --> 13:56.320]  At least apple hadn't had a spring event
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.520]  So it was almost six months and no news up until WDC and this year changed all that again
[14:02.080 --> 14:04.800]  Yeah, it's like you can't please people because in those years
[14:04.800 --> 14:07.920]  when they when they moved the iPad and
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.360]  Like 2010 11 I think even 12. Yeah
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.800]  New iPads came out in the early part of the year spring late winter or whatever you want to call it and
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.640]  Then when they stopped that like you said we more or less started going like
[14:27.200 --> 14:32.160]  Until WDC before we heard from them and people would complain what the hell are they doing you know?
[14:32.160 --> 14:36.560]  They've lost it. They don't they don't do anything anymore. That's not innovating. All right
[14:38.480 --> 14:40.480]  Now when they do it's
[14:42.560 --> 14:46.240]  They've lost focus. Yeah, they've lost focus. That's exactly right
[14:47.200 --> 14:48.240]  They're done
[14:48.240 --> 14:52.560]  The two things that were interesting to meet the beginning of the year was the very beginning at least was conjecture over
[14:52.800 --> 14:58.800]  Project Titan which had just broken at the end of the previous year and yours and a few other people talking about the price of the gold watch
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.800]  Because we had no idea back then what it was gonna be. Yeah, so like a year ago
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.560]  That's really you know, we knew that the watch was coming. We knew they were gonna have a gold one
[15:07.680 --> 15:09.680]  Nobody knew what it was going to cost
[15:10.720 --> 15:18.560]  And Titan I don't well, I don't it's anything different today than a year ago regarding that's the car for those of you who don't keep out. Yes code names
[15:19.920 --> 15:24.000]  You know at the top of your head. I don't know that any you know, it's
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.400]  Eventually, it's gonna not be a
[15:28.800 --> 15:36.880]  You know secret rumor project, but I don't know that anything happened this year compared to last that makes it seem a more normal stuff
[15:39.280 --> 15:45.680]  The gold watch was fascinating to me because this year more than any other it felt like Apple started segmenting their product line
[15:45.680 --> 15:51.200]  And that caused an incredible amount of stress and anxiety for the community because we were used to really they're being few products
[15:51.200 --> 15:58.080]  Almost every one of them was for us and now there were gold watches and on one port MacBooks and and products that might be
[15:58.080 --> 16:02.480]  Apple products, but not ones that we would want and that was very uncomfortable for a lot of people I
[16:02.960 --> 16:04.960]  think that we
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.840]  To me it was I don't regret it because I thought it was fascinating to think about it
[16:09.840 --> 16:11.440]  I had a lot of fun writing about
[16:11.440 --> 16:15.840]  trended guess what the watch pricing was gonna be in hindsight though
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.240]  We've spent way more time thinking we collectively spent way more time thinking and speculating on what the gold
[16:22.880 --> 16:30.640]  Apple watch additions mean for Apple and this watch as a product before they came out then afterwards like yes
[16:30.640 --> 16:31.920]  Once they came out
[16:32.240 --> 16:35.120]  It's like the gold one the difference between
[16:35.760 --> 16:42.160]  Our universe where the Apple watch addition exists and the alternate universe where the gold one doesn't even exist
[16:42.160 --> 16:46.400]  It's there's almost no differences between those those two hypotheticals
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.560]  They had a nice spike in sales when Apple store Dubai opened and that's about it
[16:51.680 --> 16:54.080]  Oh, I have noted. I have seen them. I saw one
[16:55.840 --> 16:57.840]  I forget when
[16:57.840 --> 17:04.080]  Must have been August when I was in Vegas for a few days in August and I saw one on somebody's wrist there
[17:05.280 --> 17:10.000]  And I know I've heard from readers who've seen them, you know here and there because but they're definitely rare enough that it's like
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.600]  When people do see somebody wearing one that they you know, they think like hey, I'll email Gruber and tell them
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.920]  I saw somebody wearing one. It's pretty, you know, for obvious reasons. It's pretty rare. I mean because they're really really quite expensive
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.120]  For me was more the sign because as Apple gets complaints all the time that they never do anything different
[17:27.120 --> 17:29.600]  They don't take risks. They don't experiment. They should buy this company
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.760]  And these are our products that do take those kinds of risks whether they gold Apple watch
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.560]  You know in the long lens of history is good or not at least they were willing to try something different
[17:38.560 --> 17:40.560]  And I like when Apple does that I
[17:40.960 --> 17:46.960]  Would say this with the watch in hindsight, and I just you know as the year peered out or played out
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.960]  I guess I should say
[17:49.360 --> 17:51.360]  I feel very strongly
[17:52.080 --> 17:56.720]  That the best Apple watch is the sport edition
[17:57.600 --> 18:01.600]  And I don't even mean it in the sense that you're getting the more bang for your buck
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.040]  You know the way that sometimes when people do reviews
[18:05.040 --> 18:08.560]  of like a category of product and
[18:09.360 --> 18:13.760]  They say here's our pick for the best. It's not necessarily that they mean it's the best
[18:13.760 --> 18:19.200]  It's the best given the price, you know like the best car might be the Honda Accord
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.360]  Somebody would say but they're not trying to say that it's literally a better car than
[18:23.840 --> 18:25.840]  You know a hundred and ten thousand dollar
[18:26.640 --> 18:30.400]  You know top of the line Mercedes S class. They're saying that given you know
[18:30.400 --> 18:36.880]  I'm saying flat out that I think the Apple watch sport edition is the best version of the watch period like
[18:38.480 --> 18:41.920]  Full stop don't worry about the fact that it costs less than the other ones
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.320]  Yeah, I mean it's got a wide variety of looks. It's got the silver to the black the rose gold the gold
[18:46.640 --> 18:52.000]  It's super light. It's got probably the best taptic engine of any of the of the watch is a lot to recommend it
[18:52.160 --> 18:55.920]  It's the taptic engine that to me makes me say that because on mine
[18:55.920 --> 19:02.960]  My you know the one that I that I personally own is the black stainless steel one the taptic engine was never that great
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.600]  To start with wasn't wasn't broken. I wouldn't call it broken. It just did didn't feel great
[19:09.600 --> 19:13.840]  And it certainly didn't feel like the demo ones that Apple had which were like the
[19:14.400 --> 19:20.800]  Platonic ideal of what this was supposed to feel like and quite frankly just didn't feel as good to me as the sport one that I have
[19:21.600 --> 19:24.960]  I've got a review unit sport watch here. My son has a sport edition
[19:24.960 --> 19:31.760]  The taptic engine just doesn't feel as good and the other factor is that as the years gone on the taptic engine in my
[19:32.160 --> 19:38.800]  Black stainless one has gotten worse. It's just somehow it's not weaker, but it's like looser
[19:39.520 --> 19:41.520]  Somehow it's very hard to describe
[19:42.640 --> 19:48.480]  I just feel very strongly that the sport one is a superior product. Yeah, my black stainless steel is the same
[19:48.480 --> 19:50.480]  I think we got ours at the same time
[19:50.480 --> 19:54.320]  Yeah, I got my
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.800]  The black stainless steel that I have is the same and I don't know if that's because it's early on
[19:58.800 --> 20:00.800]  And there were some rumors that they
[20:00.800 --> 20:06.400]  That they shipped later because there was trouble with one of the taptic engine suppliers and they had to ditch a bunch of the engines
[20:06.400 --> 20:09.360]  And and that's pushed a lot of the delivery dates out
[20:09.600 --> 20:14.080]  But the the stainless steel watch I got with her messed up later on is has a much better taptic engine
[20:14.080 --> 20:19.280]  So hopefully they figured that part out. Yeah, so that's interesting to me. So you you got the
[20:19.280 --> 20:25.120]  My sport or not my sport my personal Apple watch is one that I ordered on the first day
[20:25.120 --> 20:30.480]  You career, which was I think April 10th and I got it, you know, at some point in mid May
[20:32.960 --> 20:38.480]  That's interesting that you so you got the Hermes one, which is a stainless steel
[20:40.240 --> 20:43.120]  Apple watch even after all this time. I still get
[20:43.120 --> 20:51.280]  I still want to call it Apple watch steel just when talking about it just to be clear as opposed to Apple watches a generic platform
[20:51.280 --> 20:55.920]  Which is anyway, that's well, maybe this year they'll fix it
[20:56.880 --> 21:01.760]  But it's interesting to me that you feel like you got a better taptic engine in that one
[21:02.640 --> 21:04.400]  Yeah, and it shipped with watchOS 2 on it
[21:04.400 --> 21:10.560]  So I'm guessing that it was later in the production. It wasn't just an original you know one that they've that I had to update when I got it out of the box
[21:10.560 --> 21:12.560]  Mm-hmm
[21:13.280 --> 21:18.000]  So that's to me is one and and interesting to that. That's just
[21:18.800 --> 21:22.080]  The other the only thing I don't like about the sport one is the
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.800]  I do wish that
[21:24.800 --> 21:33.360]  That that that it had the state or sapphire crystal instead of the glass totally understand why it doesn't because of the price
[21:33.360 --> 21:42.080]  But just in terms of giving it a a whole hearted endorsement as if you were going to buy an Apple watch today
[21:42.080 --> 21:46.160]  Which one would I recommend the only thing that would keep me from wholeheartedly recommending?
[21:46.960 --> 21:50.640]  The sport ones is the fact that it doesn't have the sapphire display
[21:51.920 --> 21:54.560]  But even my son's which he has worn very regularly
[21:55.200 --> 22:01.120]  Throughout the year it definitely has scratches, but they're very very fine and they are definitely not visible
[22:01.120 --> 22:04.320]  Unless you're looking for them like holding it up to the light
[22:05.280 --> 22:08.960]  And you know, he's just an 11 year old kid. He's he's pretty careful with this stuff
[22:08.960 --> 22:10.960]  But I mean, it's not like he you know
[22:11.360 --> 22:14.160]  Hasn't exposed it to a lot of you know wear and tear
[22:15.120 --> 22:20.480]  We spoke about this before and the the it feels like the production quality on the Apple watches are
[22:20.880 --> 22:26.080]  He's as good if not better than any product apples release like the diamond like coating on the back stainless steel one
[22:26.080 --> 22:30.720]  I've thought I've scratched it several times and it's turned out that it's taken some steel or some concrete off
[22:30.720 --> 22:34.880]  So something else and so watch itself underneath this fine. Yeah, that's true for mine as well
[22:34.880 --> 22:40.400]  I will say that with the the DLC coating on mine and I said I sent you pictures a few weeks ago on it
[22:41.120 --> 22:46.480]  Literally looks mint condition. I really feel like in terms of scratches
[22:46.560 --> 22:50.000]  I could if just if I cleaned it with just warm water and
[22:50.560 --> 22:52.640]  You know, maybe a toothbrush or whatever they say to use
[22:52.960 --> 22:59.360]  But just to clean it to get some little bits of sand and stuff like that or dust out of there in terms of scratches
[22:59.360 --> 23:03.280]  I think I could pass it off as mint like new in bonds. It is that
[23:03.760 --> 23:09.760]  Unbelievable and that that's not true for any kind of normal stainless steel watch. Yes. Yeah, it's remarkable
[23:10.720 --> 23:12.720]  so
[23:12.960 --> 23:17.040]  What about the launch of Apple watch in hindsight got a lot of
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.440]  I would say controversy
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.680]  I would say that there was controversy about it just in terms of the fact that
[23:24.800 --> 23:26.800]  It wasn't in stores
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.440]  You had to make appointments to try it on in stores
[23:30.480 --> 23:35.280]  Even people who ordered right on day one had you know, some people didn't get their watches till the end of May
[23:36.080 --> 23:39.120]  There were certain bands that didn't even ship until summer
[23:41.440 --> 23:46.080]  Lots of people complained about that, but is that is that just the nature of
[23:46.640 --> 23:51.840]  An brand new product that you know the first time they ever made a watch of course the rollout's gonna be like that
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.000]  Yeah, I think we've seen that previously with some things like the retina displays and the early iPhones
[23:58.640 --> 24:03.360]  It created production shortages and the thing with Apple is that they sprint at those deadlines
[24:03.440 --> 24:06.960]  It's not like they have the products ready way in advance and they just accumulate them from months
[24:06.960 --> 24:10.320]  They ship them as fast as possible and sometimes when you do that
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.600]  You overshoot like something doesn't work out and I have the feeling that whether it was some of the leathers for some of the straps
[24:15.600 --> 24:19.520]  They had to swap out or some of the taptic engines that didn't have the yield rates that they needed
[24:19.520 --> 24:24.080]  They just didn't have enough of them on hand and that couple with the fact that it was a new product
[24:24.640 --> 24:30.720]  You ended up being a goofy launch and it felt like everything that they did was sort of an attempt to mitigate
[24:31.280 --> 24:39.600]  The problems with getting that product on the market as best that they could in hindsight though like now after Christmas and you know
[24:40.080 --> 24:44.640]  Obviously, I sure everything I saw is that there were no supply problems with any of the watches
[24:44.640 --> 24:50.000]  You know for the holidays and just talking, you know, Craig our friend Kerry Hawkenberry just posted a thing about it
[24:50.560 --> 24:52.560]  the downloads of his
[24:52.880 --> 24:56.320]  Little free clicker app for the watch that despite
[24:56.880 --> 24:59.440]  You know huge huge spike on Christmas day, you know
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.200]  So at least some anecdotal evidence that you know a significant number of people got Apple watches for Christmas
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.360]  You know, which I was obviously the plan. It's not that's not shocking or surprising news
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.120]  But in hindsight the fact that the April of May
[25:15.760 --> 25:22.320]  June timeframe was a rocky launch in terms of having everything available when it was yeah, so what?
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.360]  Yeah, it's it's I don't want to say it's concerning because it's repeated
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.880]  But we've seen that again with things like the Apple pencil which hasn't been available to to launch with the iPad Pro
[25:33.120 --> 25:39.840]  They're getting a few in every now and then and again brand new product and it's incredibly hard to coordinate the manufacturing for all these brand
[25:39.840 --> 25:45.840]  New products all at one time. What's in the fapel had their drawers? They absolutely would want it all to last in time because they'd sell far more that way
[25:46.640 --> 25:48.720]  What's the availability on the pencil right now?
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.360]  Still it's not it's still come you get a fear. They get a few in at a time and sell it quickly
[25:56.000 --> 25:56.960]  Um
[25:57.120 --> 26:02.080]  Well, we'll come back to that later, but that's interesting. I didn't know that that was that was hard to buy
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.000]  Looks like oh, yeah, if you go to if you go to apple.com today as we record
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.200]  And try to buy from the website. It is available to ship four to five weeks. Wow. Yeah
[26:14.800 --> 26:20.320]  Yeah, I kind of feel like that's the nature of some of these new things especially ones that really are sort of
[26:21.440 --> 26:27.440]  You know like the watch of the pencil where it's it's not even just well. We used to have these you know hundred and
[26:29.200 --> 26:34.080]  160 some pixel prints screens and now we've gone to 100 you know
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.200]  Four times the pixels 330 per inch
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.640]  Um, you know, this is everything about it is a new thing all of it
[26:43.040 --> 26:47.440]  You know, it's not just the tip or whatever other sensors are in the pencil. It's the whole thing
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.320]  Yeah, everything has to be almost perfect to get it all to land at the same time and once in a while
[26:52.320 --> 26:57.040]  It's not perfect and we see that with the watch with the pencil things like that. So what do you think
[26:57.040 --> 27:02.880]  With the watch what do you think we're going to see this coming here?
[27:04.560 --> 27:08.320]  If we just look at past activities being the best indicator of future activities
[27:08.320 --> 27:10.320]  I think the watch ends up getting
[27:11.120 --> 27:18.000]  Almost like what happened with the iPad 2 or the iPhone 3G where they just get better at making it and that manifest itself and it being
[27:19.040 --> 27:19.360]  Lighter
[27:19.360 --> 27:22.960]  I don't know if necessarily has to be thinner because it's got all those it's got that sensor stack on it
[27:22.960 --> 27:29.040]  But there'll be a new design because that's what Apple does and my biggest hope because you know some people are nervous
[27:29.040 --> 27:30.240]  They have to change the casing every year
[27:30.240 --> 27:31.400]  I've got so many straps now
[27:31.400 --> 27:33.600]  I'm biggest nightmares if the straps aren't compatible
[27:33.760 --> 27:39.680]  So I'm hoping that whatever they do with the watch we get a strap compatibility for as long as we got 30 pin doc connector compatibility
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.720]  Yeah, I would hope so but on the other hand, I don't want to bet on it though
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.160]  I feel like that was at least their hope originally. Yes
[27:48.160 --> 27:52.640]  I feel like they're not going to let that constrain them if
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.680]  If it means that they if they feel like they could come out with something really better
[27:58.240 --> 28:01.600]  That they would take that bullet in the early years of the product
[28:03.520 --> 28:06.880]  We'll see I would if I guess if I had to bet I'd place a small bet that
[28:07.360 --> 28:10.960]  Whatever the Apple watch too looks like it'll be strap compatible
[28:11.600 --> 28:17.520]  There's some obvious gaps like the first iPhone didn't have GPS the first Apple watch didn't have the screen GPS
[28:17.520 --> 28:23.320]  It doesn't have discrete radio technology and either like you can't just go on LTE or Wi-Fi very you can go on Wi-Fi by itself
[28:23.320 --> 28:24.720]  But it's not full on Wi-Fi
[28:24.720 --> 28:30.480]  So there's things like that that once the the thermal and the the power constraints go down low enough for the optimized
[28:30.480 --> 28:36.280]  Well enough that they'll be able to build in. Yeah, I don't know if we're there yet though. I feel like it's not going to be a
[28:37.440 --> 28:39.920]  I feel like we're not set for a radical
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.200]  Upgrade on well, they're trying like I was at a Starbucks and I have my Apple watch on in the guy goes
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.280]  Oh wait, I have the Samsung watch and it's got 3G and he ran into the back and he ran out with it
[28:49.280 --> 28:51.280]  And it was a size of a small phone. Yeah
[28:51.280 --> 28:55.040]  On his wrist and the other one that had 3G didn't they didn't end up being able to ship it
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.080]  I forget which one that was but it was a recent watch that was gonna come out. Oh, it was LG
[29:00.080 --> 29:03.760]  LGs yeah, or being yeah, they couldn't ship it because these stuff this stuff is really hard
[29:04.480 --> 29:07.720]  Yeah, I can't imagine that they're gonna have independent 3G
[29:09.320 --> 29:13.200]  I don't know. It's I mean, eventually it's going to happen. I feel like one year out
[29:13.200 --> 29:17.280]  It that's a bit much to ask what I would really like to see is just for now
[29:18.400 --> 29:27.760]  I would like to see an Apple watch too that remains a satellite of your iPhone and just is way way way more robust in terms of
[29:28.400 --> 29:30.400]  having a
[29:30.400 --> 29:31.520]  Fast
[29:31.520 --> 29:34.000]  Responsive connection between the phone in the watch
[29:34.800 --> 29:36.000]  I have to
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  Computer on a chip is gonna be super interesting to see
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.880]  Yeah, and I feel like that's the area where they are
[29:43.600 --> 29:48.000]  Most likely and again, this is just looking at the last
[29:49.520 --> 29:51.520]  You know the
[29:52.240 --> 29:55.280]  Eight seven eight years of Apple the post
[29:56.160 --> 30:02.560]  iPhone Apple the thing that they have most consistently been able to do in terms of year-over-year
[30:02.560 --> 30:08.400]  Improvement just give them 12 months and see what they come up with is improve those those
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.680]  You know the CPUs and chipsets inside these devices
[30:14.400 --> 30:16.400]  Yeah, we could talk about this later, but
[30:16.800 --> 30:21.840]  One of my my biggest story of the year for Apple was Johnny Sarugi's hardware platforms team
[30:22.320 --> 30:25.040]  Just the work that they've done that almost never gets any credit
[30:25.040 --> 30:30.880]  But from chipsets to storage controllers to things like 3D they've just been knocking it out the park
[30:30.880 --> 30:35.760]  Yeah, well, they don't it's not that they don't get credit and it's unrecognized
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.760]  But for the most part
[30:37.760 --> 30:41.040]  so much gets written about Apple and it almost all gets written
[30:41.840 --> 30:43.200]  from the
[30:43.200 --> 30:47.120]  External perspective of looking at the final product and
[30:48.240 --> 30:54.720]  You know complaining about those things that you that are exposed and on the outside as opposed to sort of looking
[30:54.720 --> 31:01.280]  Trying to look at it from the inside out and say good God. This is remarkable what you know, you know, you know
[31:01.680 --> 31:08.000]  What the graphics performance is like on this iPad pro or if you really let it ask you 10 years ago who's it
[31:08.000 --> 31:08.800]  Would out, you know
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.520]  If someone had come and told you John Apple's gonna be the most exciting chip design company in the world
[31:13.840 --> 31:15.840]  Who would have all thought they were crazy
[31:15.840 --> 31:20.240]  Well, yeah, I think so too definitely just because it wasn't part of their history
[31:20.240 --> 31:25.440]  And now it kind of is but it's it also it's more silent because they
[31:26.240 --> 31:28.240]  They're only customers themselves
[31:28.400 --> 31:29.920]  Yes, you know, and they're not
[31:31.200 --> 31:34.880]  They're not peddling these chips to other makers to do things with
[31:35.440 --> 31:39.440]  Which is a huge advantage because they don't have to worry about profit for a profit or loss on a chip set level
[31:39.440 --> 31:42.800]  They don't have to support other like they don't have to support things like direct X on their chips
[31:42.800 --> 31:48.400]  And they don't have to put anyone else's architecture and they can cater to exactly what they want to do on a software side like for
[31:48.400 --> 31:55.520]  The four case sorry three four case streams, you know, handled it once all right even even you know after a couple of years of these devices
[31:55.520 --> 31:57.520]  Even if you look at the
[31:57.520 --> 31:59.520]  Just like the first iPad
[32:00.320 --> 32:02.320]  In 2010 so just go back
[32:02.800 --> 32:07.280]  At this point that would be six years ago, right because we got a kind of start thinking about
[32:08.160 --> 32:15.200]  I was gonna say five just 2015 minus 2010, but it's five and a half. Yeah. Well five and like 10 12 three court. Yeah
[32:15.200 --> 32:19.840]  Just go back to that first iPad and I remember you know
[32:20.320 --> 32:26.240]  Being very impressed by how smooth the the whole thing was and like just scrolling when I first got my hands on it
[32:27.040 --> 32:34.000]  Um, but clearly it wasn't you know, it had a lower resolution or pixels per inch density then the iPhone did it was only like
[32:34.640 --> 32:36.320]  133
[32:36.320 --> 32:40.720]  Right because then it went to 266 when they went red you could definitely see pixels
[32:40.720 --> 32:49.360]  And it wasn't that fast and then if you had given me the the pixel count of the iPad pro and so when do you think they'll
[32:49.360 --> 32:55.520]  They'll be able to make one of these devices an iOS device with a display with that many pixels and have it
[32:55.520 --> 33:00.640]  You know complete complete 60 frames per second responsiveness. I would have thought well
[33:00.640 --> 33:01.200]  It's possible
[33:01.200 --> 33:06.240]  But I would have thought, you know, maybe like 10 years and you know, it was it was only five years
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.680]  So that you know it was at least double what I would have guessed as
[33:09.680 --> 33:11.680]  as a
[33:12.560 --> 33:14.560]  optimistic scenario
[33:14.560 --> 33:18.400]  There's a funny story about you know Steve Jobs wanting sushi at Cafe Max
[33:18.400 --> 33:23.360]  So he just told them go get me the best sushi chef in the world and they went and got him a great sushi chef and the same time
[33:23.360 --> 33:26.000]  He said, you know, I want some I don't understand these chips that things
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.160]  I just want this get me the best chip guy in the world and they went and caught him the best chip guy in the world and
[33:30.560 --> 33:35.920]  Over the time they just kept accumulating really really good chip people and I think most of them still aren't publicly well-known that those people are
[33:35.920 --> 33:39.840]  Working at Apple, but the team they've assembled there is absolutely industry leading
[33:39.840 --> 33:45.200]  I think we're gonna only see more and more impressive stuff from them as time goes on. Yeah, and I really do feel like
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.640]  That's what Apple watch needs the most
[33:51.680 --> 33:54.400]  You know, you can you can criticize, you know, it's
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.640]  There's a weird aspect to it in terms of
[33:58.640 --> 34:07.440]  Watch is being jewelry and watches being you know anything that qualifies as jewelry being something that people use to sort of signify their own
[34:07.440 --> 34:11.680]  Personal sensor style and the fact that if you look at traditional watches
[34:12.960 --> 34:17.440]  It's a product category where it's almost an uncountable
[34:18.480 --> 34:24.000]  Number of options even if you just said I'm gonna go to my local shopping mall and I'm gonna buy it myself a watch
[34:24.480 --> 34:27.280]  Just in the stores and that one mall that you go to
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.720]  The number of watches that you would consider if you looked at all of them is you know
[34:32.720 --> 34:39.280]  You wouldn't be able to do it in a dagger and staggering and then you know with with serious variety in
[34:40.080 --> 34:45.440]  In the in the looks that you can go through and then with Apple watch
[34:46.400 --> 34:51.680]  The pitch is everybody's gonna get a watch that's more or less looks the same and yes, there are you know
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.680]  there's a difference between the
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.200]  Steel and leather and the sport bands
[34:58.160 --> 35:00.640]  But the watch itself is fundamentally this
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.160]  identical
[35:05.680 --> 35:07.680]  Capsules shaped
[35:07.680 --> 35:14.000]  Rectangle and you know, there's a reason for that. I don't think that they can't it's not feasible for them even with the number
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.160]  You know just think about the variety of options. They have given this limited design
[35:18.800 --> 35:22.000]  That's that's a weird thing and you know for people
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  not to go off on a
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.040]  Down the rabbit hole of round versus rectangular and you know, which is the way to go for smart watches
[35:31.680 --> 35:33.680]  I
[35:33.680 --> 35:35.680]  Think they went rectangular for good reason
[35:36.160 --> 35:39.280]  But just even given that distinction alone
[35:39.840 --> 35:42.720]  I understand that then there's a reason that people could criticize that
[35:42.720 --> 35:46.480]  But I don't think that that's the sort of thing that they need to look at for Apple watch too
[35:47.040 --> 35:49.040]  like I feel like the basic look and
[35:49.040 --> 35:56.320]  Lay out of it is fine and that's absolutely not what's holding it back from being more useful to more people
[35:56.320 --> 35:58.480]  It was good enough for Leah and Jedi. It's good enough for me
[36:00.080 --> 36:04.800]  That was amazing. I that was you who tweeted that right. Yeah, I can't believe I didn't see that
[36:06.400 --> 36:08.400]  That screenshot
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.840]  More I hadn't seen that since Apple watch came out so if I'll put it in the show notes
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.960]  I promised but but Renee had posted a tweet a screenshot from Return of the Jedi where Leia
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.960]  Is
[36:20.960 --> 36:29.120]  Risk communicator really does look like an Apple watch. I mean not like not like so much that you would suspect that it was photoshopped onto the screenshot
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  But it looks pretty similar. Yeah
[36:31.760 --> 36:33.760]  Amazing
[36:33.760 --> 36:40.160]  So anyway, my hope for 2016's Apple watch too, which I'm guessing will probably come out around the same time as last year's
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.200]  I'm you know, there are rumors already that there's going to be a March event this year and I would not be surprised about the watch too comes out
[36:47.200 --> 36:51.920]  My guess is Apple watch too will look
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.920]  Very much like Apple watch one case compatible and that all of the improvements will be
[36:59.520 --> 37:06.640]  Pretty much from Johnny's Rudy's team. I think and of course. I of course obviously software, you know, oh Apple watch three
[37:07.360 --> 37:12.480]  Two Apple watch OS three to watch. Oh, yeah, watch us watch us three to
[37:12.480 --> 37:18.720]  To take advantage of I agree and I think that the mistake that we often make in technology is people say
[37:18.720 --> 37:20.480]  I don't want to buy a new Apple watch again
[37:20.480 --> 37:23.360]  I just bought one last year, but Apple's never targeted year over year
[37:23.520 --> 37:27.120]  I mean, they're happy if you want to upgrade your app over a year and there's some script subscription things
[37:27.120 --> 37:32.160]  They're doing now that is more geared towards that but traditionally the second version is not meant for the people
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.280]  Have the first version, but for people who didn't for whatever reason buy the first version
[37:35.280 --> 37:39.600]  And there's a lot of people who don't have Apple watches and those are the ones that they're going to gun for with the second
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.960]  Right, and the criticism from people who bought Apple watch one is inevitable and it will be
[37:45.520 --> 37:46.640]  vociferous
[37:46.640 --> 37:52.480]  But if you think about it from Apple's perspective and sometimes I think when I when I take the think about it from Apple's
[37:52.800 --> 37:56.880]  Perspective angle on an explanation for why they're doing this people get angry
[37:57.040 --> 38:00.800]  But they're still not being logical like what else is Apple to do?
[38:01.440 --> 38:02.800]  Are they
[38:02.800 --> 38:08.720]  You know the only the only two options they would have had would have been not to release the watch one last year
[38:08.720 --> 38:10.160]  at all
[38:10.160 --> 38:15.040]  Because that there's a new one they knew that the two was coming out in 2016
[38:16.320 --> 38:23.000]  Which is true every year. Yeah, which it if you get locked into that type of thinking they would they would not release anything
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.880]  It would turn into willy walk is chocolate factory that's closed and doesn't release anything which might be good for the privately held walk
[38:28.880 --> 38:33.280]  I chocolate company, but it's not good at all for the publicly held Apple
[38:33.600 --> 38:35.600]  Apple incorporated
[38:35.600 --> 38:42.000]  And then what would be the other thing to do to to not release Apple watch to which they could do this year
[38:42.000 --> 38:49.000]  But just to make Apple watch one user's happy. Well, that's suicide in the tech tech world. You can't just sell an old thing
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.200]  So you don't annoy the people who had it. I mean this is the it's you know
[38:55.200 --> 38:57.360]  I think Steve Jobs said it about as well as anybody could
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.400]  Not really with a year over your upgrade, but when the it back in 2007 when the price dropped of the iPhone
[39:04.400 --> 39:06.720]  Two or three months after first came out
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.040]  It was like hey, this is this is technology it moves fast
[39:12.040 --> 39:16.880]  You know we're we're trying to make you know make this as fast as possible and sell it at the best price
[39:16.880 --> 39:18.960]  We can as fast as we can and we you know
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.960]  We can't worry about breaking eggs along the way
[39:21.600 --> 39:23.320]  And for the thing you people do get angry
[39:23.320 --> 39:27.480]  But for me the explaining at least the best as we can what Apple is thinking at least
[39:27.480 --> 39:31.280]  Unless people hate Apple intelligently instead of hating them for superficial reactionary reasons
[39:31.280 --> 39:35.040]  They can listen to the explanation understand the point of view and then hate them for a good reason
[39:37.600 --> 39:41.760]  It does it is you know, I've I heard a lot of people say it, you know, I mean
[39:42.880 --> 39:44.960]  You know, I bought with I you know
[39:44.960 --> 39:51.800]  I bought my stainless steel Apple watch with my eyes wide open knowing that you know that it's probably only gonna be good for a year
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.000]  And I'm an idiot. I just throw money away all sorts of Apple stuff
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.640]  I think the people who are sensible about it and a lots and lots of people I heard from said
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.480]  I'm I'm willing to wait a year to get my first Apple watch very sensible very sensible
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.480]  Take it will and if that's the type of personality you have you know, you know, you're going to
[40:12.480 --> 40:15.200]  I think you're gonna be very satisfied with that patience or
[40:15.800 --> 40:20.640]  People who are maybe slightly less patience or maybe had more money willing to throw away people who said
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.880]  I'm gonna get one, but I'm gonna get the sport model because I bet I'm gonna want to get a new one the next year all very
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.760]  Well some people never want the Rev A board and some people always want to be on the ground floor of a new technology and this
[40:31.760 --> 40:37.960]  Different kinds of personalities not everyone's the same and you can sort of pick the one that you want and it's up to you to make an informed rational adult
[40:37.960 --> 40:39.960]  decision yeah
[40:39.960 --> 40:45.840]  All right one last thing prediction on the Apple watch do you do you agree that it'll probably be announced in March?
[40:46.560 --> 40:50.000]  Yeah, I think this year's March event will pretty closely mirror last year's
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.960]  Do you think that it will be more like the Apple or the iPhone 3G or
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.240]  The 3GS
[41:00.560 --> 41:04.480]  See that's interesting because the 3G famously the Apple didn't count it as a full version
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.040]  It was a one comma product. It wasn't the two comma product. That was the 3GS
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.680]  So it was basically what the iPhone was meant to be from an internal
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.640]  At least tracking perspective where I think Apple watch
[41:15.640 --> 41:19.640]  Hardware to your point will be somewhere. I don't know what they're gonna designate it
[41:19.640 --> 41:26.080]  But I think I'm I'm agreeing with you on that that it's gonna be more of a rounding out the way watch OS 2 was then another leap forward
[41:27.880 --> 41:29.960]  So which one do you think it's gonna be more like? I?
[41:30.800 --> 41:36.480]  Think it'll be more like the 3G and you know keeping in mind that Apple often has a conservative version of your product and a
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.760]  Very aspirational version of our product and they have to figure out which one they can reliably deliver any year
[41:40.760 --> 41:43.480]  I think they absolutely have both ready, but I think
[41:43.480 --> 41:48.840]  Based on the Apple watch this year. I think we'll get more like the 3G version. Hmm. I wonder
[41:48.840 --> 41:51.800]  I I was kind of thinking maybe it would be more like a 3GS
[41:53.160 --> 41:55.160]  Like maybe more like
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.400]  To compare them more like
[42:00.040 --> 42:02.040]  The original iPhone
[42:02.040 --> 42:07.640]  Didn't exist that we started with the 3G and we're going to the 3GS in other words
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.880]  It'll look a lot. It was a better version a better comparison. Yeah, it's thinner
[42:11.880 --> 42:17.480]  I agree with you. I think it's the inverse because the I the iPhone 3G got a better radio, but not a better processor
[42:17.800 --> 42:22.280]  And I think the the I Apple watch to is gonna get the better processor not necessarily the radios
[42:22.720 --> 42:27.440]  Right, that's what I'm thinking I'm thinking better processor and yeah, probably not better radios
[42:28.240 --> 42:34.040]  Well, we'll see I don't maybe I'm sure of the two and maybe you're right that the iPad 2 is maybe the better example
[42:34.040 --> 42:37.600]  Although the iPad 2 is really largely about making the thing thinner
[42:37.600 --> 42:42.720]  Yeah, I don't think we're gonna see I don't think we're gonna see that with the watch. I don't think we're gonna see a thinner version
[42:42.720 --> 42:46.320]  I don't think we need to well, we will eventually I don't
[42:49.440 --> 42:56.720]  We never need to I mean there's I but it inevitably they're going to get to a point where where
[42:57.360 --> 42:59.520]  Johnny I was team is going to start pressing the
[43:00.320 --> 43:02.800]  The no, we're gonna make it a lot thinner
[43:02.800 --> 43:08.160]  Well, they typically make things thinner because they want to make them lighter because lighter for them is essential to usability
[43:08.160 --> 43:10.160]  But things like the Apple TV
[43:10.600 --> 43:13.200]  3D touch there are exceptions to that rule for them
[43:13.200 --> 43:19.080]  There's things that they believe are important enough features or capabilities that they're gonna just blow through the the envelopes on that
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.600]  But they have a huge thermal like I my understanding is that the S1 runs as hot as it physically can for that enclosure
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.520]  Yeah, that's I wouldn't be surprised especially given how slow some things are
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.520]  Yeah, that there's just no way so anyway, we'll see. I'm excited about it
[43:33.920 --> 43:38.520]  There was something else that was really cool about the March event and that was sort of the coming out of Jeff Williams
[43:38.520 --> 43:44.800]  Like he introduced research kit and that was the first time we saw who's arguably one of the most powerful people at Apple on the stage
[43:45.320 --> 43:51.680]  Right, he went from beginning of the year had hadn't appeared on stage and was sort of a
[43:52.200 --> 43:57.840]  You know it wasn't a secret. I mean is there on it the press bios page for Apple executives
[43:57.840 --> 44:03.080]  But wasn't really known publicly by them by the end of the year. He'd been promoted to chief operating officer
[44:03.440 --> 44:08.880]  Yeah, and I've been on stage. I think he was at WC was definitely at the September event and he owned the watch this year
[44:08.880 --> 44:10.880]  It was his his project
[44:10.880 --> 44:13.040]  Yes, that is actually true
[44:13.680 --> 44:18.120]  and not well-known and you know kind of a a
[44:20.640 --> 44:23.360]  I thought about this and I didn't write about much about it
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.080]  But I thought about it when they made the announcement a week or two ago about the the executive
[44:29.400 --> 44:32.720]  Not really changes. It's more or less promotions and like you wrote
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.560]  And your piece that I'm more sort of making official changes that have been made internally for a while
[44:38.560 --> 44:44.560]  Like Johnny Sarugi's stature within the company was SVP level and in terms of you know
[44:44.560 --> 44:50.640]  the respect that he has and and the understanding of how important it is it just wasn't reflected in this if you do the job before you get the
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.720]  title at Apple right and and I was thinking about it with
[44:55.920 --> 45:02.200]  With Jeff Williams and clearly part of the the gravity of being named COO of Apple is
[45:03.040 --> 45:09.680]  That in the modern era which again, I always say is post next reunification
[45:09.760 --> 45:14.200]  There's only ever been one other COO and that was Tim Cook and we see you know
[45:14.200 --> 45:24.360]  What that meant for him and you know it clearly meant that he was number two and in line to take over CEO if anything happened to the CEO
[45:24.360 --> 45:31.840]  And I think you know it's hard not to think the same with Jeff Williams and the other thing too that made me think about it is that
[45:32.280 --> 45:41.280]  To my knowledge when when Tim Cook was COO, he never really had the role over a new product the way that Jeff Williams did with the watch in particular
[45:41.280 --> 45:49.520]  Yeah, it was a different like the the iPhone was the clear example of the big new product category and that Scott forced all basically on
[45:49.520 --> 45:54.320]  I mean Steve Jobs owned everything but Scott forced all was the closest to not being Steve Jobs and owning a product
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.680]  And there's there's no sort of Scotch forest all that's all been unified now and they do have you know Kevin lynched
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.760]  But he's doing to the software and I think a brand new product. It needs somebody to sort of incubate it and
[46:05.760 --> 46:13.760]  And and take care of it as a specific new product before I can get reintegrated into the existing structure and Apple that ships iPhones and iPads every year
[46:13.960 --> 46:22.360]  Yeah, and I think that the operational angle on that is and again, it's I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, but
[46:24.960 --> 46:29.160]  I think I mean the number of iPhones they sold in 2007 was
[46:29.160 --> 46:42.520]  Maybe I don't just a few million was in the millions. Yeah, I of that first one until you know the the one with the metal casing was really really small and millions
[46:42.520 --> 46:45.520]  And I think they got to 10 million by the end of
[46:46.560 --> 46:53.360]  2008 which would be a full year of selling the original iPhone and in six or seven months of selling the 3G
[46:53.360 --> 47:00.120]  But it was really with the subsidies that it took off. Yeah, and it's really with the 3G where production really ramped up
[47:00.120 --> 47:12.080]  Yeah, and for all of our like we just mentioned it earlier in the show all of the bitching and moaning about the the early production delays on Apple watch in April and May
[47:13.400 --> 47:19.000]  Here we are just you know nine months later and we've gone through a Christmas where there were no
[47:19.000 --> 47:27.280]  No supply problems and they've sold way more Apple watches when we don't know exactly what because they're not how many because they're not breaking them out
[47:27.280 --> 47:34.760]  But it's clear that they've sold way more Apple watches in this first year than they did iPhones in its first year
[47:34.760 --> 47:36.760]  And it's just they were able to do it internationally
[47:36.760 --> 47:41.280]  Which the original iPhone wasn't it was available in one country and then maybe three or four countries for most of that year
[47:41.280 --> 47:42.960]  Yeah, that's also very true
[47:42.960 --> 47:51.440]  Yeah, and it's again, and I'm not saying that I don't bring this up to to posit that the Apple watch is on pace to be more popular than the iPhone
[47:51.440 --> 47:57.680]  I think it's clearly just because Apple as a company and its products that it's it it is you know
[47:57.680 --> 48:00.760]  It's more of a cultural phenomenon and it can make a new product
[48:02.360 --> 48:09.960]  Known to people in a way that it couldn't before and they've brought they've broadened their base of people who consider themselves
[48:10.240 --> 48:11.720]  Apple customers
[48:11.720 --> 48:16.760]  And it all the iPod took a while for the iPod to ramp up till after it became available on windows
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.680]  It took a while for the iPhone drama the iPad ramped up incredibly quickly
[48:19.680 --> 48:22.960]  But then it it also slowed down fast to and it feels like you know
[48:22.960 --> 48:26.240]  You're on a highway that has a speed limit and regardless of how fast you accelerate
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.960]  There's still that speed limit so you can have initial bursts or you could have a slow acceleration
[48:30.960 --> 48:40.480]  But all the products where to get there in the end. I also think that with the iPad which I think sold somewhere between like 10 and 15 million in its first year
[48:40.480 --> 48:46.560]  Don't quote me on that, but I'm pretty sure that the ballpark right I remember being on a
[48:48.520 --> 48:55.680]  TV show Clayton Morris has show with with people guessing at first-year sales and it was like me and Andy and atco and yes
[48:55.680 --> 48:57.680]  I think Jason Snell
[48:57.680 --> 49:01.400]  I forget who else was on but my guess yeah Jason was on remotely
[49:02.280 --> 49:06.120]  And my guess was way higher than everybody else's and I was still a little low
[49:06.120 --> 49:13.520]  Of what actually turned out but even then I feel like making that original iPad
[49:14.000 --> 49:21.360]  Wasn't anywhere near as much of a stretch operationally because they had three years under their belt of making iPhones and the technology was
[49:21.360 --> 49:27.400]  Fundamentally the same except this was bigger and so it in some ways that makes it easier whereas with the watch
[49:27.800 --> 49:34.240]  Here they are taking these iPhone style chips and display technology
[49:34.240 --> 49:43.200]  And et cetera and making a really really small thing with incredibly tight tolerance for so many of these things physically that it was harder
[49:44.200 --> 49:50.920]  Yeah, I've had ran a cent even ran what was called iPhone OS at the time where with watch OS they created that separate interface layer
[49:50.920 --> 49:54.040]  Like the clock faces and for carousel and for some other thing, right?
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.240]  The big difference I think is that the I there was also 10 years of phones before the iPhone and 10 years of tablets before the
[50:01.240 --> 50:04.960]  iPad so they sort of knew what the problems were that they wanted to fix where with the Apple watch
[50:04.960 --> 50:09.400]  They entered the product character category very quickly and there isn't as much evidence as what
[50:09.920 --> 50:15.560]  They don't have as much information about what that product needs to be there's sort of part of the experiment for the first time
[50:15.560 --> 50:17.520]  Yeah, all right, let's take a break
[50:17.520 --> 50:21.440]  I'll thank another sponsor and then we'll go like next up is WWDC, right?
[50:21.920 --> 50:23.040]  Yeah, all right
[50:23.040 --> 50:26.000]  Well our next sponsor is our good friends at
[50:26.000 --> 50:32.640]  Automatic what is it automatic is a connected car adapter. I call it. I call it a dingus
[50:32.640 --> 50:36.280]  It's a dingus and it plugs into your car's diagnostic port
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.920]  That's the all these cars have the exact same port every car manufactured since 1996 has one of these ports
[50:43.920 --> 50:48.440]  It's this thing that when you take it in take your car into the dealer or your local
[50:48.840 --> 50:49.480]  Auto shop
[50:49.480 --> 50:54.440]  They just plug a thing into the same port and it tells them all this diagnostic information about your car
[50:54.440 --> 50:56.440]  if you have like a warning like come on there or
[50:57.440 --> 51:03.720]  Hey, go, you know, you need to go get your oil change and it says like go get service a one or something like that
[51:04.640 --> 51:07.840]  If you have automatic you plug your you plug it into your car
[51:07.840 --> 51:13.280]  It tells you exactly what that means it actually decodes it and tells you or if there's like a problem with the car
[51:13.280 --> 51:15.280]  Not just like regular service
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.660]  But they say like you know error code
[51:18.360 --> 51:20.360]  F2 or something like that
[51:20.360 --> 51:27.760]  Automatic can tell you exactly what that means and you'll know whether it's hey, this is actually serious or be this is you know
[51:27.760 --> 51:33.160]  This is yeah, something you got to get looked at but you can you know finish finish going where you're going and not worry about it
[51:34.200 --> 51:40.560]  Really, really useful get just totally opens up exactly what's going on with your car and it's kind of remarkable how much modern cars
[51:41.040 --> 51:44.640]  Know about what's you know going on system wide throughout the whole car
[51:45.640 --> 51:47.640]  And it does all sorts of other things too
[51:47.640 --> 51:54.240]  It hooks up to your phone and use this GPS and it can give you a log of your trips and parking location
[51:54.240 --> 52:02.880]  It can use the GPS while you're driving to sort of rate your fuel economy and your efficiency score you on that
[52:03.600 --> 52:07.060]  And they have a new app store for
[52:07.960 --> 52:11.960]  Automatic and you go there and it lets you hook up all sorts of things now
[52:11.960 --> 52:13.240]  You do this by using your phone
[52:13.240 --> 52:19.240]  You just have your phone paired with bluetooth to the automatic in your car and you can hook up all sorts of cool things like
[52:19.240 --> 52:22.200]  IFTTT that's if that if this than that
[52:22.920 --> 52:27.960]  And set up all sorts of scenarios where it says if you get within five
[52:28.680 --> 52:30.440]  Miles of your home
[52:30.440 --> 52:36.840]  You could have it hook up to your nest thermostat and have it, you know turn on the heat or in the summer turn on the air conditioning
[52:37.960 --> 52:40.520]  All sorts of recipes like that they have
[52:40.520 --> 52:43.800]  Lots and lots of apps over 20 apps are in their app store
[52:43.800 --> 52:48.840]  You can go check it out at automatic.com slash apps and see the sort of things that are available
[52:49.960 --> 52:52.440]  Bottom line. This is all really really cool stuff
[52:53.160 --> 52:57.080]  It works on any kind of car any car made after 1996
[52:57.080 --> 53:03.080]  So it's not like you need a certain brand or something like that a certain model any car you just plug this thing in and hooks it up
[53:03.560 --> 53:08.760]  Even can tell you things like where you parked your car because it has this GPS and it can remember stuff like that
[53:08.760 --> 53:14.760]  How much is it? Well, here's the thing it is super super it's amazingly cheap
[53:14.760 --> 53:21.000]  It's just a hundred dollars ninety nine dollars ninety five cents normally, but they have a 20 percent off
[53:21.800 --> 53:26.600]  Offer for talk show listeners. That's 20 bucks. You'll save 20 bucks on this thing get it for $80
[53:27.080 --> 53:31.640]  By going to automatic.com slash the talk show automatic
[53:32.120 --> 53:33.640]  Just spelled like the dictionary word
[53:33.640 --> 53:38.200]  dot com slash the talk show it ships in two business days
[53:38.680 --> 53:42.680]  You'll get it just two days from now after you listen to the show go order right now
[53:42.920 --> 53:47.880]  And here's the last thing I'll say 45 day return policy with free shipping
[53:47.880 --> 53:51.320]  So if you buy it you don't feel like this thing's worth 80 bucks
[53:51.480 --> 53:53.880]  You got 45 days send it back to them and
[53:54.680 --> 53:57.160]  No money is out of your wallet. I thanks to automatic
[53:58.840 --> 54:00.840]  All right, WWDC
[54:00.840 --> 54:06.120]  Well, there was one thing right before WWDC that was super interesting and that was Johnny I have getting promoted to chief design officer
[54:06.120 --> 54:09.080]  Oh, that is true new direct reports going right to Tim Cook
[54:12.120 --> 54:19.080]  Yeah, who was new direct reports. It was Alan die. Yeah, and whole worth. I'm forgetting his first Richard Richard. Oh, yes
[54:21.960 --> 54:26.520]  And that created this whole is Johnny I've leaving is his role changing it was again
[54:26.520 --> 54:31.960]  A lot of noise. I think over the course of the year. No one even really thinks about it anymore. No, I don't think so
[54:33.960 --> 54:36.840]  And I get the feeling I don't feel like
[54:39.160 --> 54:44.440]  You know again would it be the biggest shock in the world if he leaves in a couple of years
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.280]  I guess not I mean you never know, you know, and he's obviously a very private person. You don't really know, you know
[54:51.560 --> 54:53.720]  You know can't if you don't know him how could you say
[54:53.720 --> 54:58.480]  And this could be then be seen in hindsight as a you know a precursor to that
[55:00.440 --> 55:05.720]  But my guess is no because from what I do know of him and what you know if it's obvious is if
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.440]  He's obsessive about design. Where else what else is he going to do? Like it seems to me like
[55:10.840 --> 55:14.360]  What he would want to do if he could do whatever he wanted to all day every day is
[55:14.920 --> 55:16.920]  Ron Apple's design team
[55:16.920 --> 55:18.280]  We saw that in the 60 minutes
[55:18.280 --> 55:24.440]  Especially showed everything from his little sketchbook where he made the the wash designs to the CNC machine spinning out behind him
[55:24.600 --> 55:27.960]  to his glee over the giant glass panels being installed at at
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.080]  Campus too. Yeah, yeah, the biggest pieces of curved glass I've ever made
[55:33.880 --> 55:35.880]  Yeah, it's pretty interesting. What a great job
[55:36.440 --> 55:45.400]  Yeah, and I feel like what the promotion of die and and the whole worth really meant was that it frees him up from
[55:45.400 --> 55:49.800]  administrative and pure a kratic
[55:50.440 --> 55:57.080]  Responsibilities that there are meetings now that instead of heke attending, you know die and or whole worth can attend
[55:57.880 --> 56:03.560]  And just things like for people on the design team like approving vacation schedules or whatever else
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.440]  I have the kind of administrative stuff that somebody has to be in charge of it's not him anymore
[56:08.440 --> 56:14.840]  And that yeah, and I think it's similar to what we'll talk about with Phil Shiller later where it removes bottlenecks from the process of Apple as Apple scales
[56:15.480 --> 56:18.360]  Yeah, I think so, and I think it lets him
[56:21.160 --> 56:29.560]  Let's him spend more time on what he's drawn to as opposed to what he you know the the paraphernalia the the miscellaneous stuff they have to do
[56:31.640 --> 56:33.640]  that's just
[56:33.480 --> 56:35.480]  sort of
[56:35.480 --> 56:39.960]  Busy work. I don't know for lack of a better term. Yeah, there's two universal truths and big businesses
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.720]  That is everyone wants more management and more power and then anyone who has it wants to get rid of it
[56:44.120 --> 56:51.720]  Yeah, and maybe that's you know exactly what what this was about and I kind of get the feeling that that both die and whole worth are very very trusted by
[56:51.720 --> 56:52.760]  I've
[56:52.840 --> 57:00.200]  Yeah, and so it's it's not there's I don't think there's any kind of Machiavellian aspect to it where they're angling to take over
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.200]  I feel like you know they're at the stage in their careers where they're looking for more
[57:04.200 --> 57:10.680]  Management and authority and I've I really do think it's as simple as that he just wants to spend you know
[57:10.680 --> 57:18.000]  He's only got you know so many hours in the day every day. I want to spend them obsessing over every you know
[57:18.840 --> 57:24.200]  Design period whether there's teams are fantastic like the the ID team in the H I teams
[57:24.200 --> 57:29.320]  They they said I'm only two people have ever left ID over the his Johnny I was ten year and those teams know what they're doing
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.720]  Yeah, well, and it's a very small team
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.040]  I mean if and and if there is a bottleneck still within the company that might be part of it
[57:36.040 --> 57:38.680]  But I don't know that it's it's it's you know
[57:38.680 --> 57:41.240]  I think it's clearly one of those mythical man-month type things
[57:41.240 --> 57:44.760]  We're throwing more people at it isn't going to make more better design come out
[57:45.320 --> 57:51.240]  I like that in that 60 minute special one of the things I really like seeing. Oh is that they brought out the
[57:52.040 --> 57:54.040]  10 prototype
[57:54.520 --> 57:55.560]  iPhone
[57:55.560 --> 57:56.840]  sixes
[57:56.840 --> 58:00.040]  Yes from every size, you know from
[58:00.040 --> 58:01.640]  um
[58:01.640 --> 58:05.880]  four inches up to I'm not quite sure what that biggest was probably six
[58:07.720 --> 58:09.800]  Um, but that they had ten different
[58:10.600 --> 58:14.600]  iPhone six shapes and I don't know that I don't I I you know
[58:14.600 --> 58:18.040]  They didn't turn them on so you couldn't see whether they were actually like electronic device
[58:18.120 --> 58:21.880]  You know like working iPhones or where they just things that you held in your hand
[58:22.680 --> 58:26.760]  But they had all ten of them there for for them to display. I thought that was pretty cool
[58:26.760 --> 58:33.640]  Yeah, and that it wasn't just about the size, but to to I've there was part of the entire product experience of having a device of that size
[58:36.520 --> 58:40.920]  Yeah, it's you know, I I believed it when I said that
[58:40.920 --> 58:46.280]  You know, that was the story that they told when they came out with the two, you know the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch
[58:46.840 --> 58:48.840]  iPhone six sizes
[58:49.640 --> 58:56.360]  And they said, you know, we made 10 10 versions from every size from 4.0 up to I think 6.0 inches in that
[58:56.360 --> 58:58.360]  These were the two that felt right
[58:58.520 --> 59:02.200]  Um, but I thought it was pretty cool that they still had them there and brought them out
[59:03.080 --> 59:04.120]  Yeah
[59:04.120 --> 59:06.120]  Everything else under tarps. Yeah
[59:08.360 --> 59:13.160]  Uh, I like the story it reminded me of the story from the New Yorker
[59:13.160 --> 59:18.360]  Which was the profile of of Johnny. I've that came this year. I guess that was this year right had daddy
[59:18.920 --> 59:21.560]  Yeah, right around the watch launch. Yeah, right around the watch launch
[59:21.640 --> 59:23.160]  um
[59:23.160 --> 59:28.200]  I'm truly truly almost book length New Yorker profile on Johnny. I've and
[59:29.800 --> 59:31.800]  Uh
[59:31.800 --> 59:34.760]  When he was in the just the guy who wrote it was in the design lab
[59:35.400 --> 59:42.520]  One of the tables, you know several of the tables had those black shrouds over them and you could see that you know that there was the the outline
[59:43.400 --> 59:47.000]  The shape of whatever it was you could see like the vague shape of whatever it is they were covering
[59:47.000 --> 59:51.480]  But then there was one where it was completely flat. It was just a table that was completely flat
[59:51.480 --> 59:53.480]  As though there was nothing on it
[59:53.480 --> 59:57.880]  Why was it covered up and then in hindsight it was because that was the table
[59:58.440 --> 1:00:02.040]  That was going to be the the apple watch display table
[1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:06.200]  Where yes, whereas a profile is a three-dimensional shape
[1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:08.280]  It's exactly the same as apple standard tables
[1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:12.440]  But it has a glass top that displays the apple watches underneath
[1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:17.800]  Yeah, and that pretty ingenious thing where the badges open up the drawers underneath the retail staff
[1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:23.480]  Yeah, yeah, very true. It's a very clever design, but I think it's it's fat in it to me at emblem
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.600]  it's an emblem of
[1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:30.440]  The way that design is truly a first-class
[1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:40.280]  Practice at apple that it's exactly the same team that is designing the tables that are in the stores to display the watch
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:44.280]  As who displayed the watch itself
[1:00:44.280 --> 1:00:49.880]  Design the watch itself and who designed the packaging for the watch
[1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:54.920]  Right that they want to control the experience the entire way through the product's life
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.720]  Right, right the store itself is a is a product the
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:05.240]  including you know the lighting the the surface that's used for the floor
[1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  the dimensions the tables
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:11.720]  The products themselves are products
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:19.560]  And the packaging or products and the process is whereby that goes from the table to you in the bag and the entire thing is just
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:26.040]  Feelingly engineered. Yeah, and I feel like that's unique at that, you know at apple and I don't know I don't it's
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:29.440]  I think it'd be very difficult for other companies to to replicate
[1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.840]  All right, June WWDC
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:34.840]  Yes
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:36.840]  I
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:43.880]  Would say the clunker of the bunch. Well, I think there was a three-fold announcement fundamentally iOS 9
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  Mac OS 10
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.600]  point 11
[1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:56.520]  Mac OS 10 10 point 11 El Capitan and apple music and I think apple music has got to be considered the clunker of the bunch
[1:01:58.120 --> 1:02:02.360]  Yeah, it was interesting because the first half it was all yeah, and I think watch OS 2
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:08.280]  I think we saw that for the first time there, but though that was all very engineering focused and Craig Federici did his talk and
[1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:10.280]  I think Kevin Lynch did the watch stuff
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:16.920]  It was definitely was I forget and then it was an incredibly abrupt change in tone when Eddie Q and then Jimmy I
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:22.120]  A vine and then Drake came out on stage almost like a separate event that had been somehow stuck together
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Yeah, and it's funny to me
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.440]  Or interesting because again treating all of these things not as
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:37.480]  Well that they it's easy to say to try to treat the actual shipping products the things you buy
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:43.880]  The actual iPhone in your hand the actual watch on your wrist as the only things that matter because that's ultimately the most important thing
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:53.000]  But I find it instructive and it usually pays off to treat everything from the actual like the events to the packaging to the ads
[1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:57.000]  To you know to all of it as looking for signs of
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:02.920]  You know is this is polished and coherent as it could be I think it's interesting
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:10.760]  And again, you can't prove the correlation, but it's interesting that the announcement event of Apple music at WWDCs keynote
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:13.160]  was
[1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:15.160]  sloppy and
[1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:20.280]  The actual shipping Apple music when it first came out was sloppy and
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:23.000]  Not quite
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Like a sort of lack of tolerance
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.360]  I
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:32.280]  Think I think I think under Steve Jobs like he ran that show and almost everything that went on during that show was carefully scrutinized
[1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:35.560]  And I think Tim Cook lets people run their divisions more than
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:39.080]  Then Steve Jobs did maybe because Apple spoke big now
[1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:45.400]  He has to as well and they almost run like little little companies especially iTunes which you know has its own marketing its own events its own
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:49.560]  Developer it's that it basically is its own company and
[1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:55.640]  When you see these things, I I don't know how much like to someone like Tim Cook would play this Steve Jobs role of saying no
[1:03:55.640 --> 1:04:00.600]  You have to come out then you have to say this and I'm handling this and you're doing this and it is more of a
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:06.200]  It is more open to each of the of the SPPs to do their own thing and at the same time
[1:04:06.440 --> 1:04:10.600]  Some people just love the traditional Steve Jobs keynote. It's super polished. There's some jokes
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.040]  But it's it's super on point
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:13.560]  It's it's clear. It's concise
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:17.080]  And then Craig Federica gets last for making jokes the next year
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:21.880]  We get more jokes and then you know they they start talking about Eddie doing karaoke and suddenly
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:25.560]  Aries you know Eddie's doing a little bit of dancing and I think that they're trying to feel their way
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:31.800]  Into being a kindler kinder friendlier presentation, but they they don't know where that line is yet
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:36.200]  Yeah, and I feel like that that keynote in particular
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:40.680]  I think without question this year's WWDC keynote was the worst
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:47.160]  Event Apple the worst keynote, you know, not just call it an official keynote
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:51.480]  I'll say keynote to include you know product and introductions like September's
[1:04:52.040 --> 1:04:57.560]  You know iPhone introduction. It's the worst keynote that they've had since since Steve
[1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:04.760]  Dot or maybe the worst one they ever had you know in the modern era because none of the ones with Steve were were bad
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:08.840]  You feel that the whole way through or just because of the Apple music segment
[1:05:08.840 --> 1:05:11.400]  I would say just because of the Apple music segment
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.400]  But the fact that it ran so long even if the Apple music segment had been coherent and well thought out
[1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:20.840]  I think the fact that they blew so far past two hours was a problem
[1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:29.480]  And and I say this not just for the petty reason that I really had to go to the bathroom by the end of it
[1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:31.480]  And I was in the audience
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.120]  And just the fact that it you know, it's a long time to just sit
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:41.560]  I think like that the unofficial rule that they should be two hours at the most is good
[1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:47.480]  And I think it always pays out plays out when you see other companies that have long events that go too long
[1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:54.040]  People it when it ends you don't want the media who who are giving every most people out in the world
[1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:59.640]  They're their impression of it comes not firsthand because there's only you know even at a big place like WWDC
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:03.400]  There's only 4,000 seats and most of them are you know conference attendees
[1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:10.040]  It you don't want the first impression to be from media people saying that was too long
[1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:16.120]  But the other thing that you usually can see from other companies and that with Steve Jobs there
[1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:20.680]  You'd never never happen is you see the internal politics playing out on stage
[1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:29.720]  The fighting over you know that stage time is is political capital within the company and whether it's good for the company
[1:06:29.720 --> 1:06:35.560]  Or not that X number of people come out and get X number of minutes for their thing
[1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:39.720]  They're all fighting for it because they're fighting for their personal stature
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:47.560]  Or they're fighting for their products stature within the company as opposed to what is the best thing for the company as a whole
[1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:53.400]  You know, and I think Apple has you know this year as well as any other year
[1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:56.280]  With Apple there are always products
[1:06:56.280 --> 1:07:04.280]  That in and of themselves might be worth time in a product introduction or a keynote if there's a keynote coming up
[1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:08.280]  but get cut because there are so many other
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:14.520]  Other things that are more worth it for them if they're only gonna go for 90 minutes
[1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:20.200]  Yeah, absolutely, and I believe stuff was cut from this keynote like my understanding is they wanted to get it down to two hours
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:21.800]  But especially the Apple music segment
[1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:26.680]  It didn't even sound like a state on script, which is something else that you don't you don't see in previous keynotes
[1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:28.200]  Yeah
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:30.440]  Yeah, like and you know
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:34.360]  Drake's like inexplicable like what the hell
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:39.720]  What was that I got just remember going back to my notes and it was like my notes are like Drake
[1:07:40.360 --> 1:07:42.360]  And then it's like nothing
[1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:47.400]  And some people who aren't us who were very young and very hip loved the Drake was on stage
[1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:52.920]  But I think when you look at it overall in terms of an Apple event, it doesn't become part of the case of whole
[1:07:53.320 --> 1:07:54.520]  Usually in a good one
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:59.960]  It's it doesn't matter whether the person if it's a very you know if it's some kind of famous celebrity or something like that
[1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:02.280]  There still is a
[1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:06.200]  There's you can see whether you agree with it or not whether it worked for you personally
[1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:10.040]  You can understand what the point was that that person was supposed to get across
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:12.600]  If you could cut it and it doesn't affect the event
[1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:18.040]  You should cut it and likewise like Tim Cook segue into baseball, which was interesting, but like you could have cut that entire
[1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:23.320]  We're gonna give them all iPhone stuff and iPad stuff out of the keynote and it would not have changed the event at all
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:29.640]  Yeah, but I can see why they put that in though. It was it was a way of emphasizing
[1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:34.040]  With third party proof that the the anecdote was that
[1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:42.280]  I forget what team it was if it was the royals or who but somebody a major league baseball had
[1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:47.320]  Hit like a you know like they're 100 career home run and it landed in their own teams
[1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.600]  Bullpen where the relief pitchers warm up over the home run fence
[1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.720]  So the relief pitchers on the team were in possession of this ball
[1:08:55.720 --> 1:09:01.640]  Which the player obviously wanted to have so they the the relief pitchers put together a list of here's what we want you to buy us
[1:09:01.640 --> 1:09:08.120]  And we'll give you the ball and like everything everything on the list. Yes. It was an Apple product and a 50
[1:09:09.560 --> 1:09:11.560]  barrel of lube
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.800]  Yeah, it was great, but at a two on almost a two and a half hour keynote
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:22.120]  I think again, you start cutting anything you can well they showed it, but they also photoshopped out the 50 gallon
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:25.480]  Problem loom
[1:09:25.800 --> 1:09:28.760]  Which I understand why they did because you know
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:33.480]  I I understand that they kind of want to keep these things g rated
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:36.280]  If not PG and
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.560]  In the 50 gallon
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:42.360]  Ballon blue maybe makes it a little bit more BG 13
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:47.800]  But good god was that funny like they kind of took out the funniest part of I agree
[1:09:47.880 --> 1:09:52.600]  I do know I know what you're talking about though that if it's already going over two hours even that you you take out
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.640]  What do you know how much do they need to brag about that? Yeah? I
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:59.800]  I found it worrisome though. I do. I honestly feel like
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.640]  I kind of feel like the most worrisome thing as an apple watcher of the year was not any any product in particular
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:09.640]  But the WWDC keynote as a whole
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:16.760]  Just and that's nothing only Tim Cook can can take control of and unless he wants to take control of that
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:18.760]  I don't think we'll see that change like
[1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:21.400]  it's
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:25.480]  One of the unique things about Steve Jobs, and it wasn't the most important thing
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:33.400]  It was just the most the thing that we on the outside got to see was that he had an innate and uncanny talent as a showman
[1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.880]  that he was
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.280]  Good he those keynotes were all entirely in his head and
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:44.040]  Of course, they've always been broken up into segments because that's how you do it
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:46.040]  but that he had this ability like
[1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:48.920]  from you know seat to
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:56.760]  Watching you know Phil Schiller come out and do the introduction for the new MacBook or power book or whatever it was going back in time
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:05.640]  And then this and that he could just close his eyes and just see how this whole thing would play out and feel as a 90-minute
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:09.880]  Show and could figure out things like you know what?
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:17.880]  Let's not introduce this at the end as one more thing. Let's move it up front and blow people away
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:24.120]  Right out of the gate, you know and could just see how that would play, you know and knew which you know
[1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:30.920]  I think you know some of it's arbitrary and you can quibble with it, but they he you know like a film director could just sort of feel how
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:36.280]  You know whether these scenes are good in and of themselves
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:42.440]  What do they combine to as a whole as a show and there was and and combine the showmanship with the
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:50.280]  Absolute unquestioned authority of I don't care who you are. I don't care if you're you know a senior vice president of whatever
[1:11:51.080 --> 1:11:55.640]  This thing that you want to get you know that we've been rehearsing for two weeks and you you know
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:02.680]  Want that stage time to do if I've decided the night before the keynote that that whole thing is cut because it just doesn't play right
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:11.000]  That's it, you know, there's you know tough luck and I kind of feel like I kind of just feel like that whole Apple
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.800]  I
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:20.040]  Don't know I just feel like that whole Apple music intro was that nobody was there with the authority to say you know what Eddie
[1:12:20.040 --> 1:12:22.040]  This just isn't this isn't ready
[1:12:22.040 --> 1:12:26.760]  There's very few things like a lot of people will say this wouldn't happen if Steve Jobs was around and usually that they have
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:29.640]  They have no idea what Steve Jobs would have decided at any moment or not
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:33.880]  But this is one of those few things where you can look back at the long history of Apple keynotes and see that
[1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:38.280]  He had a rhythm in a pace and a delivery and a concept for these things that you know
[1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:43.400]  Was just beyond anyone else in the industry and we're not we're not getting that anymore. Yeah
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:49.400]  Yeah, I really I have hesitate to ever pull that play that card
[1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:53.240]  But I would say that that keynote and the Apple music music segment
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:54.040]  In particular
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:12:57.080]  That's one of the few where I would say that wouldn't happen if Steve was still around
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:01.240]  Yeah, well, it's one of the it's one of the few things where you can do it because he was it was there was no one
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:05.720]  Intermediateing Steve Jobs and you know he was on stage and he was talking to the audience. It was incredibly direct
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:11.320]  So it's not behind the scenes and who was in charge of this and who did that it it was Steve Jobs talking to us
[1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:16.000]  And I think that's an easy thing to talk about right and I've heard it from you know
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:19.080]  You know people who work at Apple
[1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:25.800]  You know that that Steve was the guy you know that he didn't just show up and there wasn't somebody else organizing the show
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:29.640]  He really was putting the show together and I've also heard it from
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:35.080]  You know like people who worked at third-party companies, but who were getting you know
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.080]  We're invited by Apple to
[1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.320]  You know come on stage as you know
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:42.280]  You know you might and it's funny
[1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:46.840]  They always it's always exactly the same which is that they get invited to come out. They go into sequester
[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:51.800]  It's like you're pretty much like locked into like Apple a very nice prison
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:58.440]  And you rehearse and rehearse and rehearse and you have no idea whether you're actually going to be in the keynote until
[1:13:58.680 --> 1:14:03.320]  You know like the night before and even then you know it might be you're in your out
[1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.680]  And their events team is absolutely spectacular and they do a fantastic job
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:14.280]  But they they don't control who's up on stage for how long are saying what that's become the the executive in charge of that thing
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:16.440]  It's no longer just Steve Jobs
[1:14:16.680 --> 1:14:21.000]  Right, and I do kind of feel bottom line is that it's sort of effectively a committee now
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And it might be a small committee
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:25.640]  You know, Shiller at EQ
[1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:27.800]  Shirley Tim Cook
[1:14:27.800 --> 1:14:32.200]  You know, I think I wouldn't underestimate even though he's not on stage personally
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:36.520]  I wouldn't underestimate Johnny Ives influence on these things on the events
[1:14:37.160 --> 1:14:39.760]  You know the fact that he does his and pre-recorded
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:42.840]  films is
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:45.640]  Doesn't make him less involved. I think in the structure of the event
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:51.640]  Yeah, and even those those videos used to have faces in them. These to have several people like that and reach out
[1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:56.440]  It's sometimes appear in them definitely Bob Mansfield in previous years and this year it was just voiceover
[1:14:56.840 --> 1:15:03.000]  Yeah, and it was just Johnny Ive. Yeah more cinematic less less documentary style and more
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:08.920]  I don't know like product like a more advertising style
[1:15:09.400 --> 1:15:14.040]  And to your point about Apple music being a sloppy product the thing to me is when they made that announcement when Jenny
[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:18.760]  When Jimmy I have I said one single thought around music and you just start thinking about that from an interface
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.760]  Perspective and how many masters that has to that has to save all like it has to serve all the traditional people like Jim
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:30.120]  Downable who have 40,000 songs on their hard drive it has to serve people who only want to stream music
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:32.120]  They had a social network built into there
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:34.840]  So it has to you'll be accessible and you put that in a separate app
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:40.040]  No one is ever going to open it by itself and it creates almost an impossible problem to be solved
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:43.560]  Can I tell you a funny story I heard about Jimmy? Yeah, I hope I
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:45.000]  absolutely
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.320]  This is absolutely positively unverifiable because this is like
[1:15:49.880 --> 1:15:51.160]  fourth-hand
[1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:53.160]  Maybe like a fourth-hand story
[1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:58.760]  But in terms of the gist of the story is that Jimmy you outline is
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:02.560]  From people who have had to deal with him within Apple is
[1:16:04.680 --> 1:16:06.680]  eye rolling
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:11.720]  And that at one point when they were talking about what to do with Apple music he tossed out in a meeting
[1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:20.040]  The idea that what if we just what if we get rid of apps and when you just turn on your iPhone there's your music
[1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:31.480]  They were like wouldn't that just be not just be like what the iPod was and he was like no no
[1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:34.440]  It's still your phone and you're on the you know you have the internet me
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:38.600]  But you don't have to worry about apps you just turn on your phone and there's your music
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:41.480]  It's gaming Taylor Swift the mini turn on your phone
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:46.520]  I don't know if that's true or not. I did not hear that from anybody at Apple
[1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:50.600]  I heard that from somebody who worked at Apple a long time ago and still has friends at Apple
[1:16:51.400 --> 1:16:55.160]  Yeah with that you know as the kind of stories where you know someone whose job it is isn't to implement
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.200]  Like isn't implement things on it on the atom or the bit or the pixel level. We'll just throw those kinds of things out
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.960]  Turn on your phone and there's your music
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:12.040]  What was the event that Jimmy Irvine came out and
[1:17:13.320 --> 1:17:16.120]  Was that the the WWC keynote?
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:22.920]  Yeah, he definitely came out during the WWC keynote and and where he said something that seemed like a reference
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:27.880]  What was it? He was like a reference back to like a classic Apple moment and people applauded
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:31.320]  But he didn't get it and he got confused and like turned around and looked at the slide
[1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:37.960]  Oh, I don't recall. Oh, I forget. I forget the exact details of it, but it was like
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:43.080]  Probably wasn't one more thing, but I can imagine that he was like
[1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:49.480]  He had said one more thing and everybody like kind of clapped and applauded and he didn't even get that that was
[1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:55.480]  Something that people who followed Apple for a long time would get and so he thought maybe something had gone wrong with the slides and
[1:17:55.480 --> 1:18:01.560]  Something a glitch was on the slide behind him and that's why people were laughing to him inexplicably
[1:18:01.560 --> 1:18:07.000]  And so he got like he paused and like turned around and looked at the slide, but it's slide was right and then that
[1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:14.920]  Only served to discombobulate him even further because now he now he had no idea why people were laughing and it was very very awkward
[1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:19.880]  It's always been hard to encultrate people into Apple and especially hard when you're getting this many new people
[1:18:19.880 --> 1:18:22.920]  But when these people committed executive levels, it's almost impossible
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:27.000]  So you have someone who's used to working in LA and with Hollywood and with according studios
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:33.240]  And you get them in a meeting with people who've been making you know shiny boxes all their lives. It's it's gonna be a clash
[1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:39.480]  It's from the outside. It seems like maybe Angela aren't just doing well though
[1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:43.400]  I think so I mean this was 16 minutes was also a bit of her coming out
[1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:47.160]  And I always thought I think we talked about it last year that she because she was so vocal
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:52.760]  In her previous gig that she would be more of a spokesperson for Apple and she would talk about retail more
[1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:57.160]  But apparently she's been hard at work behind the scenes just melding the online and retail
[1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:05.160]  Operations and and getting the new store concepts going it sounds like it was funny because a couple weeks ago people someone wrote an article saying
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:10.920]  Where's Angela Aaron's why she disappeared and yeah people on campus like well, we see her all the time right understand the article
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:15.160]  I kind of feel like people there's
[1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.800]  You know and again, I think it fits in with a year in review and talking about these events that
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.840]  This year there were more women on stage from Apple
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  During these events than ever before
[1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:38.280]  And that's a good thing and I don't think it is purely
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:42.440]  Happenstance. I think that it's something they're aware of internally
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:46.920]  I asked Phil Schiller about it on stage on the talk show after WWDC
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:51.080]  Absolutely, you know, they're aware of it, but you know, it's
[1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:55.000]  Has to be it's not like we're going to find a woman to do this
[1:19:55.160 --> 1:19:57.960]  It's there have to be the real problem is that
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:02.520]  Wasn't that they didn't put women on stage. It's that they didn't have women in positions where
[1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:05.480]  It was their products doing it
[1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:08.200]  Right and not to not to make excuses for it
[1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:10.120]  But Apple is an older company and older companies
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:12.760]  They've had established people like Phil Schiller has been there for a long time
[1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:17.080]  At EQ Tim Cook all these people have been there for decades and they're amongst the best in the world
[1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:19.240]  We're a new startup. They would have a much different
[1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:25.560]  Demographics starting out the gate and then Apple would right they don't it's not like they hire show people to
[1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:31.160]  To present these things on stage at their events the the products and services whatever
[1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:36.360]  There is that they're announcing are being presented by the people who are in charge of them
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:42.120]  And who know them best and who have shepherd them through to existence and so the fact that historically women
[1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:46.040]  Have been underrepresented on stage at Apple events
[1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:51.960]  Isn't doesn't mean that Apple has a problem picking who gets to go on stage in the events
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:58.600]  The problem is that they don't have enough women in positions of authority running teams within the company
[1:20:58.600 --> 1:21:05.080]  Yes, who would they're for be the person to come on stage and do it?
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:08.520]  You know and obviously that's changing
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:12.360]  With Apple pay who's the name escapes me at the moment
[1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:16.280]  I'm blocking on it too. Yeah, Apple pay and Apple news. Yes
[1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:19.480]  Both were represented by women, etc. So
[1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:22.360]  The people who are saying well, where's angel arts?
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:27.080]  Well, they're not going to bring angel arts on stage to talk about a new MacBook or something like that
[1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:30.600]  It's not just well, there's a woman on the SVP
[1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:34.440]  Leadership team therefore they should have her come out and do something
[1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:39.080]  It's only going to make sense for her to come on stage when it if there's some kind of retail
[1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:45.000]  News that they want to talk about and I think that's inevitable at some point
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:48.200]  There's going to be something that you know happens with retail
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:52.920]  That they're going to want to talk about at one of the events and of course it's going to be hurt to talk about it
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:59.160]  Yeah, retail or fashion and those are the things that Tim Cook used to speak about and unfortunately cut those at the same time
[1:21:59.160 --> 1:22:03.320]  They brought angel errands on because Tim Cook doesn't spend time on stage talking about them any more either
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:07.000]  Yeah, well, I don't know about fashion though because fashion it would be too
[1:22:08.200 --> 1:22:13.720]  I guess I could imagine it maybe with the watch that there would be something to do with the watch as a product
[1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:18.840]  That it's relation to the fashion industry. It makes sense to have angel arts be the person to do it
[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:24.840]  Because it's also I think inextricably tied to retail where it's not just apples retail
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:28.440]  but retail in general and the partnerships that they have with
[1:22:29.880 --> 1:22:31.560]  Fashion related
[1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:33.560]  Retailers that aren't the Apple store
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:38.600]  And it's you and I know because we have a lot of mutual friends there
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:45.720]  But there are phenomenally talented women engineers at Apple and women program managers and designers and developers and
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:53.560]  Those people don't just don't get to talk right whether you know at any male female doesn't even matter
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:58.600]  That's just not Apple doesn't run those type of keynotes where it doesn't have you know mid-level
[1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:02.600]  Get an occasional Chris Latner like I think that was a huge exception to it
[1:23:02.600 --> 1:23:09.000]  I don't think anyone like Chris Latner had ever spoken at a a keynote before as opposed to the the afternoon state of the union
[1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:09.960]  Yes
[1:23:09.960 --> 1:23:14.040]  Which is you know where he's been he has spoken before and where you would expect it and this year
[1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:18.920]  We had the phenomenal woman in charge of clock faces. I get a tremendous talk at the state of the union this year
[1:23:18.920 --> 1:23:20.920]  All right, remember that that was great
[1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:24.520]  Anyway, I did think I did think on 60 minutes
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.920]  I've seen Angela aren't speak before especially you know
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:31.160]  After when you know when she first got hired and announced it and I was researching into it
[1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:33.960]  But her stint on the 60 minutes
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.840]  Segment did reiterate
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:42.040]  You know the boy. She's a remarkably cogent and thoughtful person
[1:23:42.040 --> 1:23:43.800]  Yeah, no, and I agree
[1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:47.640]  But I do think that it's great that Apple is doing this and it's similar to when Tim Cook came out
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:49.240]  He said because you know if it was just up to me
[1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:50.920]  I wouldn't because I'm a private person
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:57.080]  But it's important to be a role model and I think it's important to have diverse people up on stage and super successful positions in
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:02.520]  Super successful companies like Apple to be those those role models and you have to give them opportunity
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:08.600]  Craig Federigi wasn't great his first WDC, but he's terrific now and Jeff Williams two events in much better
[1:24:08.600 --> 1:24:12.360]  presenter and if you give them these opportunities they could be just as phenomenal
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:15.000]  And it's a super deep bench like you have you know Greg Jobs
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.680]  We have also phenomenal who didn't get any time. I don't think at all on stage this year
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:24.440]  But you also have you know the woman in charge of of iPhone marketing is phenomenal and there will be opportunities
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:28.680]  When they get stage time and it'll just make I think the company better for everybody. Yeah
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:38.280]  What else about it at WWDC anything else Swift 2.0 and I think that's where they announced that it was going to open
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:40.280]  Source
[1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:45.480]  That is true. It is one they announced it would go open source by the end of the year and they they did hit that
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:51.320]  I don't know how much to say about that. I mean, I think I kind of covered that last week with
[1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.360]  a little bit
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:25:00.280]  Talk about stacking the guest deck. I don't think we need the I don't think we need the covers when I Swift on this episode
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:05.240]  It's just the feisty to say it was pretty big deal and it seems to be going very very well
[1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.560]  Yeah
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:14.120]  Content blockers ended up being another thing that enormous amounts of angst and anxiety and stress was built over and again
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:18.440]  At the end of the year. We're hardly mentioning them. Yeah, it doesn't seem you know
[1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:26.200]  Yeah, it doesn't seem to have really changed anything significantly. I think it's great. I certainly I enjoy running them
[1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.160]  And I do think that they make for a noticeable improvement, but I don't think that they bankrupted any
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:37.240]  Or or or are even on pace to bankrupt any media properties
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:41.960]  I'm kind of sad about that because I thought that was one of because the industry is just it's horrible and entranigent
[1:25:41.960 --> 1:25:44.360]  And that was one of the few things that could scare it out of its complacency
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:50.760]  And I don't think it's done a good enough job scaring them to their bottom dollars yet. Yeah, I feel like there was more talk about that
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:59.160]  When they were when it was first come out and yeah, or actually right before they came out really when people thought you know
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.720]  Good God, you know a week from now 70% of our mobile is going to disappear
[1:26:05.720 --> 1:26:07.720]  But in hindsight, you know
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:09.640]  You know
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.040]  There was like a day or two where the the app store charts were dominated by
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:19.560]  Content blockers and then not so much. Yeah
[1:26:19.560 --> 1:26:27.400]  Hopefully next year that'll spike again. Um
[1:26:29.080 --> 1:26:31.080]  So what about the summer anything over the summer?
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:37.080]  I don't think so. Oh, there was some interesting stuff like the out of nowhere and iPod touch six finally came out a modern iPod touch
[1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:43.000]  Oh, that is true. That was like July, right? Yeah, the middle of July
[1:26:44.520 --> 1:26:46.840]  Yeah, it didn't really do I mean it was exact same design
[1:26:46.840 --> 1:26:48.840]  It did have a modern an a7 processor
[1:26:49.480 --> 1:26:51.480]  So it's 64 bit
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:57.000]  And that that was about all that that came with it. There was some new iPod colors as well, but the iPod line didn't change at all
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:26:59.960]  No
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:04.600]  Do you think that the do you think that this might be it for the iPod touch?
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:10.680]  I think it's getting I think the pressure from the iPhones being more and more available and affordable and the iPod
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:15.240]  The iPad mini being as popular as it is kind of squeezes out the iPod touch in many ways
[1:27:15.240 --> 1:27:18.440]  It's still the cheapest absolute cheapest way to get to the App Store
[1:27:18.440 --> 1:27:24.840]  But I think the App Store now is a proven value and people are willing to pay a little bit more to get into it in order to get more functionality from it
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:27.880]  I was surprised by
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:32.280]  I think I've seen this from a few other places too, but like
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:40.760]  Like when I think it was united or one of these airlines was like we're gonna buy 10,000 iPhones and give them to all of our gate agents and
[1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:43.240]  flight attendants and etc
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:50.360]  That they weren't iPod touches that it seems to me like it would make more sense for that to be an iPod touch lower price
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:57.640]  You know, let's presume that there's some kind of workable, you know, Wi-Fi in the the airport that they can use
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:04.680]  That they wouldn't need to be a full why would you spend the extra money hundreds of extra dollars per unit for the phone
[1:28:04.920 --> 1:28:08.200]  When it doesn't really make sense for them to be phone if they're just using them for that
[1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:10.200]  But that's what they're using the phone
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:15.440]  Yeah, and it's probably a greater dynamic where you have sort of existing carrier relationships with enterprise
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:21.320]  You know companies and they're buying them in the thousands and you know if people are still wondering why they're 16 gigabyte
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:25.760]  iPhones, that's that's one of the big reasons as institutional buyers so it's almost like though
[1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:28.880]  They just move from blackberry to iPhone or or to something else
[1:28:33.880 --> 1:28:39.720]  But it wasn't I don't know to me it was and there's sort of like web portals all they do is access web portals or business to be to be apps
[1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:47.080]  So they need almost nothing but a web connection. Yeah. Oh, it's just it's just her name just popped into my head Jennifer Bailey
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:49.000]  Yes
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.440]  It was killing me
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:55.160]  Jennifer Bailey is the Apple executive who runs Apple Pay under Eddie Q
[1:28:55.720 --> 1:28:59.320]  Yeah, anything else in this I'm a whole bunch of other stuff. I think yeah
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:02.040]  Well, she was the one who was at age at least
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:05.080]  No, I think that I mean there was a minor stuff like Apple killed one to one
[1:29:05.080 --> 1:29:10.920]  But very little else happened until the monstrous event in September right so before we get to that
[1:29:10.920 --> 1:29:16.120]  Let's let's thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at hello HULLO
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.560]  Hello makes
[1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:21.560]  Pillows
[1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:27.000]  Literally, I mean that this is the product that that I'm here to tell you about it is a pillow have you ever tried a buckwheat
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:34.280]  Whole HULL pillow. This is a style of pillow that has been popular for centuries throughout Asia
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:39.720]  It's the best way to describe it is that it's sort of like a beanbag pillow
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:44.840]  You can feel them there almost like they feel like maybe like small coffee beans inside the pillow
[1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:47.960]  Definitely if you pick one up and shake it you can hear it
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:53.640]  It feels like something full of beans, but they're not really beans. They're their buckwheat holes
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:30:01.080]  Why would you want to do this? It sounds crazy especially if all you've ever done is sleep on a traditional feather style or you know
[1:30:01.080 --> 1:30:05.640]  Artificial or real feather whatever, but there's that similar sort of puffy type pillow
[1:30:06.440 --> 1:30:11.320]  A buckwheat hole pillow conforms to your body and provides cool comfortable support
[1:30:12.280 --> 1:30:18.600]  Air breathes through it in a way that it can't it flows freely through this in a way that keeps you cool all night long
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:20.840]  You don't get sweaty your head doesn't get hot on the pillow
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:25.320]  It's super easy to adjust you buy one of these things and
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:32.200]  You if you think it's too thick out of the box all you do is just unzip it and remove some of the holes at any time
[1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:38.280]  It's it's really you know really so totally clean. It's just just a bunch of these beans that you take out
[1:30:39.080 --> 1:30:42.840]  So you can adjust it at any time very very easy
[1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:47.400]  It's made in the USA with quality construction and materials. I've had one
[1:30:47.400 --> 1:30:52.520]  I think for over a year now my wife and I both have them and it definitely is different
[1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:56.120]  Definitely is not like it's a different style of pillow
[1:30:56.840 --> 1:31:00.280]  But once we got used to it which didn't take long. It's it really does
[1:31:01.640 --> 1:31:03.640]  I like it a lot. I really do
[1:31:04.200 --> 1:31:10.040]  It's pretty shrunken durable twill cotton case as a high quality Dunlap hidden zipper
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:15.960]  And the buckwheat hole fill is grown and milled in
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:18.440]  North Dakota right here in the United States
[1:31:18.440 --> 1:31:25.160]  It's an environmentally friendly and organic product. No chemical-based foams or feathers or anything like that in there
[1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:27.160]  Just 100%
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:31.960]  Unbleed certified cotton on the outside and these buckwheat holes on the inside
[1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:34.760]  So they have different sizes
[1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:37.320]  Starting small as 50 bucks
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:42.760]  Standard size $79 King size $129
[1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:46.760]  You can save money though
[1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:48.760]  By buying more than one and
[1:31:49.960 --> 1:31:58.920]  They have a special URL just for listeners of the show. It's hello pillow HU-L-L-O-P-I-L-L-O-O-W dot com slash
[1:31:59.720 --> 1:32:01.720]  talk show and
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:07.720]  Last but not least one percent of all of their company profits are contributed to the nature
[1:32:08.200 --> 1:32:14.760]  Conservancy, so if you're in a market for a new pillow give them a shot give hello pillow a shot really really interesting very different
[1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:21.560]  And hello pillow dot com slash talk show no, that's that's the URL
[1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:24.680]  All right September
[1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:25.680]  Yeah
[1:32:25.680 --> 1:32:29.240]  Boy, I feel like maybe we should have started with this because it's
[1:32:30.440 --> 1:32:35.320]  It was a big of well. They only did one fall event this year. So they put everything into it. Yeah
[1:32:37.080 --> 1:32:38.200]  I
[1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:41.960]  In hindsight, you know, I feel like that's probably smart
[1:32:41.960 --> 1:32:48.520]  And I feel like the other thing too is to go circle back to what I said about WWDC. I feel like they
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:55.720]  Clarified the messaging and the the coherency of the event significantly
[1:32:56.040 --> 1:33:02.120]  I can't help but suspect that internally they they recognize that the WWDC keynote was
[1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:09.640]  Not up to their own standards and the September event might have been even extra sharp because of it
[1:33:09.640 --> 1:33:13.800]  Yeah, it was for everything that they covered and they it was so big
[1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:18.280]  They didn't even have time to cover OS 10 or the Mac. They managed to get it done in I think for
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:23.560]  Well put together segments. Yeah, I mean, you know, it's if we're gonna look back at the year
[1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:24.600]  I mean
[1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:31.640]  You know, just usually the the biggest mistake I published on Darren Fireball was the night before the event predicting that
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.040]  There's no way they're gonna have only one event for the
[1:33:34.040 --> 1:33:40.120]  For the fall. Well, they hadn't like that before he'd been iPhone and I paused or something else
[1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:43.960]  In September and then Mac and and iPad in October
[1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.680]  Yeah, thank two years or three years before that but this year they had no no new Mac
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:54.040]  They had the 4k iMac, but they they sort of showed that offer ready with the 5k 5k iMac theater before
[1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:55.560]  Um
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:34:00.760]  Well, I think if they wanted to they could have I think the easiest way that they could have done it would be to hold the iPad
[1:34:00.760 --> 1:34:05.800]  Pro for October and have a separate event just for the iPad Pro and then to fill out the event
[1:34:06.520 --> 1:34:08.520]  demo L Capitan and
[1:34:09.240 --> 1:34:10.200]  Boom, there you go
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:16.040]  There's a little smaller event in October and it wasn't ready to ship anyway, so it wouldn't have even delayed the shipping of the iPad Pro
[1:34:16.600 --> 1:34:18.680]  Although we wanted to get L Cap out earlier this year
[1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:22.120]  I think it shipped on September 30th which would have pulled it out of that event
[1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:26.120]  Yeah, but it wouldn't have been fine if they would have held the L Capitan
[1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:30.360]  It wouldn't have you know if they wanted to I think it's just that they didn't want to but the you know
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:34.280]  It wasn't just my argument that I don't think they're gonna have just one event wasn't just that they
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:38.360]  Have had two events for years. It was that if they only have one event
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:40.120]  There's no way they're gonna cover all this stuff
[1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:44.440]  Yeah, and some of these things are gonna have to be cut and so I was right about that that
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:52.200]  Some of these things would have to be cut and they would go through the fall without even even re-demoing the 10 pole features of L Capitan on stage
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:56.200]  Um, I was just wrong that they would might be willing to do that
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:35:00.680]  But I think that's a good state in the side bar of the email in the slide on the
[1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:08.600]  Right that's this is how little time L Cap got on that event that when they announced the shipping date
[1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:12.760]  It was a screenshot of I think it was for the iPad Pro right
[1:35:13.640 --> 1:35:16.840]  Yeah, it was the mail app and I see was a mail from fill in
[1:35:17.240 --> 1:35:23.560]  I was like fill yeah like fill leave. I was like an email from Phil Schiller to to Federigi or somebody saying like
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:32.200]  Uh, yeah, I'll cap ship date will be September 30th top secret. Don't tell anyone and it was just in the screenshot to the mail client
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.400]  And then very quickly we had to get that up on apple dot com for the ways
[1:35:37.400 --> 1:35:42.440]  It would have been pandemonium with everyone calling to see if that was serious or not. All right. Was it a joke or was it not?
[1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:48.120]  We sat together for that one right yes me and you and Clayton Morris right yes
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:55.240]  I seem to I remember when that came up and we like like we're whispering with each other like was that real?
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:57.320]  Did I see that do you think that's do you think that's what they mean?
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:03.720]  Yeah, it was I mean it started off with Jeff Williams in the watch and it's interesting because they showed off
[1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:10.920]  New watch bands that you know Johnny I've had shown off. I think at a Paris show fashion show earlier in the year and then they announced Apple watch
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:19.640]  Hermes as I guess the the first real example of Apple partnering with a fashion shop. You know outside of their own which is super interesting to me
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:22.440]  Yeah, I think so too
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.520]  And makes me
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:26.520]  Wonder about
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:31.240]  You know future things like the car and stuff like that and will there be and you know
[1:36:31.640 --> 1:36:36.520]  Again wouldn't it would be interesting even if it wasn't like to partner with an existing car company
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:44.200]  But again like maybe to partner with Hermes and have like a car come out with an Hermes designed interior or something like that
[1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:46.360]  Yeah, I mean again
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:49.240]  They're gonna want to have products that are introductory they get people in the door
[1:36:49.240 --> 1:36:53.000]  They're gonna have the product that most people end up buying which is usually the middle of the road product
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:58.040]  And they're gonna want to have premium products people want the absolute best and when you get to things like cars and watches
[1:36:58.280 --> 1:37:01.000]  With the absolute best it isn't just about speeds and feeds
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:05.400]  Wouldn't that be interesting? I wonder it just this has never really occurred to me before
[1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:11.400]  but in the way that they for things like the car they have to be thinking in the scope of
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:14.360]  Decade right that the thing got started
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:18.280]  at least three four five years ago maybe even more and
[1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:21.160]  It's probably at least
[1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:29.480]  Three four five years away from coming to market that this is something that they've had to think you know a decade long window for
[1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:33.480]  And
[1:37:33.480 --> 1:37:38.200]  in terms of what you and I talked about you know earlier in the show about what was the point of
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:45.560]  The gold apple watch addition models and going through all this and selling these things at these high prices
[1:37:46.200 --> 1:37:48.360]  For something that was going to sell in such low quantities
[1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:51.400]  I wonder if part of it isn't
[1:37:52.040 --> 1:37:54.040]  getting you know
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:55.640]  rehearsing sort of
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:38:05.320]  Going through the the bifurcated levels of product based on significantly different orders of magnitude different prices
[1:38:06.280 --> 1:38:11.400]  And partnering with companies and and creating truly luxurious
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:17.880]  Materials using truly luxurious materials to separate these segments
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:25.560]  Not so much for the watch itself, but for the eventual car because in the car that's it's going to be
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:29.160]  Significantly more money and way more important that there are
[1:38:29.880 --> 1:38:33.960]  Maybe maybe who knows maybe the car will come out and there's one model and it's you know
[1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:36.760]  $25,000 and that's it but somehow I don't think so
[1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:42.920]  Yeah, no absolutely, and that's why I think segmentation again was so important for Apple this year because as you get into
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:46.600]  As you become a certain size your growth becomes limited
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:50.120]  You have to start segmenting and as you get into other product lines
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:53.480]  You can't just assume that they work the same way that your existing product lines do
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:57.800]  Apple's been very canny about avoiding the pitfalls that have hit a lot of other technology companies
[1:38:58.040 --> 1:39:00.920]  And part of the reason is that they they sort of think through these things
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:05.400]  They pick something they focus on it and they experiment in a myriad of different ways
[1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:06.760]  Including a lot of prototyping
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.480]  But also a lot of things like maybe like doing Apple watch them as a addition or things like that
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:14.440]  So that when they get into things like watches and things like cars
[1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:19.720]  They're not presenting them the way they present you know, and I put shuffle they're presenting in within the context of that product
[1:39:20.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  Yeah, I
[1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:29.720]  Did think I do think it was interesting too that by September you just mentioned you mentioned it's a minute or two ago that
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:38.600]  Just it was a year after Apple watch was initially unveiled, but it was really just
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:48.040]  May June July August so five months after yeah actually hit market where they had all new bands and straps and
[1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:56.360]  Didn't just add new bands and straps, but actually replaced some of the earlier colors that some of the pastels colored sport bands with
[1:39:58.120 --> 1:40:00.120]  To my eyes a
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:07.240]  Much more attractive overall lineup of colors and watch OS 2 is chipped five months after watch OS 1, which is very fast
[1:40:07.240 --> 1:40:10.240]  You know, Apple's usual product rollouts
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:13.080]  Yeah, I
[1:40:13.080 --> 1:40:21.760]  I'm more intrigued by the the hardware differences in the bands than then the OS because I kind of feel like watch OS 2
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  the calling it a 2.0 was
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:31.800]  Is a little marketing E, you know, it's really sort of it was to me closer to here's the watch OS
[1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  We really had wanted to ship originally
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:38.120]  Absolutely it was around it filled in all the little gaps that were obviously missing from the first one
[1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:43.520]  All right, and there's a big difference obviously with the native apps, you know third-party native apps being able to run right on a watch
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:49.640]  It's supposed to just being projected on the watch from your phone like like the the original watch kit apps
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:57.400]  But other than that it's really hard to point to anything and watch OS 2.0. That was really a 2.0 feature
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:02.160]  Yeah, it's interesting though that it was decoupled like they've sort of decoupled it
[1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:06.720]  You didn't you didn't have to wait for a new watch to get watch OS 2.0. They were willing to use that sort of marketing lingo with
[1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:13.720]  mid mid-cycle almost yeah, it just shows that the watch is a very they're treating the watch is a very different sort of product
[1:41:13.720 --> 1:41:17.040]  than they have the phones previously. Yeah, I almost feel like
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:26.520]  Again part of it is that they've gone through the iPhone to iPhone 3G transition within the first year as opposed to waiting an entire year for it
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:35.680]  Yeah, what was the other oh and the fact that so many I mean it's not even you don't even have to conjecture
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:41.040]  It's not like speculation or rumor that some of the features a lot of the features and I watch OS 2
[1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:49.040]  Were originally meant for watch OS 1 because they showed them a year ago, you know at the original watch event
[1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:58.160]  Things like like the additional watch faces like the hey pick your own choose your own photo from your photo library and have that as your watch face
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:06.280]  They showed that in 2014 and it wasn't there when it shipped in 2015 and some of the faces had the time travel already in them
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.720]  Yeah, so like all the stuff that we saw it was just logical completions of the things that have been set up in the first version
[1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:20.600]  Right, it almost you know the fact that time travel wasn't there originally almost it defeated the existence of the the crown
[1:42:20.840 --> 1:42:24.520]  Yes, that the crown was meant to be there for that sort of you know
[1:42:24.840 --> 1:42:30.200]  Here you want to see where you're gonna be later in the afternoon just look at your watch and spin the crown
[1:42:30.440 --> 1:42:34.320]  And to your earlier point I mean it just they weren't not capable of getting it ready in that point
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:39.600]  So should they have waited until September to release it? No, it was nice to get it out early and they can add those things as they're going
[1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:44.800]  Yeah, and the other thing that I I want to talk about on that is the
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:54.560]  The rumors and I don't doubt them but that optimistically they had hoped to ship the watch a year ago, you know by the end of 2014
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:02.360]  And you know, maybe you just need to have a goal like that to get it so that it does ship in early 2015
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:04.560]  But I feel like for these new products
[1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:07.080]  Where they have these you know
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:10.960]  I mean just compare the pencil which is the less of a
[1:43:12.120 --> 1:43:14.960]  At least at this point, you know clearly not as big a deal as the watch
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:21.960]  But the fact that here we are going into the holidays and somebody who at December 14th was like, oh, I know I want to get one more
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:24.840]  Present for my significant other I'll get him an apple pencil
[1:43:26.040 --> 1:43:35.360]  Couldn't do it in time, but with the watch you could because the watch got those kinks out of the operational and the manufacturing system
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:40.960]  In the first half of the year rather than unveiling in the in the fourth quarter
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  Absolutely, and it's it's worse for Apple because they lose the sales on those keyboards and on those pencils that just aren't in aren't on the shelves
[1:43:47.920 --> 1:43:50.840]  Yeah, you can't I that's I
[1:43:52.480 --> 1:43:56.560]  Just feel like there's so much easier to sell well what the hell
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:02.360]  I'll just get the pencil and the expensive smart keyboard while I'm buying this $1,100 iPad
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:07.720]  Then later on there's no doubt in my mind that they if they had full availability on those
[1:44:07.720 --> 1:44:11.240]  They would have sold more of them than they will because some number of people
[1:44:11.720 --> 1:44:18.280]  Who did buy the iPad Pro and when they bought it wanted to buy the pencil maybe we'll never get back around to buying
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:23.920]  Even when we've all heard stories about the original I like the you know the golden path on the original
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:27.920]  iPhone this deep jobs demonstrated in 2007 how you had to stick to it with the entire thing
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:34.520]  I just collapsed on I get getting those first products out as extremely hard and you who knows what the internal dates are for these things
[1:44:34.520 --> 1:44:36.520]  But they get them out as soon as they can
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:42.720]  It was like you had the it was something to the effect of like he had to demo safari and load the data
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:48.080]  At times web page first and then go to mail and if he'd gone to mail first and then tried to load safari
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:53.560]  Like it wouldn't have been enough RAM and it wouldn't be you know, yeah full web page wouldn't have loaded or something like you know to that effect
[1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:56.800]  You had to do it every one of those things in the right order
[1:44:56.800 --> 1:45:02.160]  And a lot of the stuff comes in hot now and whether that's because they're doing too much or because they're on certain
[1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:06.920]  Schedules it's hard to say, but they do run absolutely as fast as they can to get this stuff out
[1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:15.320]  What else was in September? So there was Apple TV new Apple TV? Yeah, iPad Pro the pencil
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:18.160]  The Apple TV was really strange for me because the Apple TV
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:25.120]  They haven't shipped one previously since 2012 March 2012 and they'd worked on a bunch of different ones
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:30.120]  They'd worked on set top boxes on like recording box. I think like just a whole different the strategy for that Apple TV
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:34.640]  Just kept changing and they just didn't ship anything and finally they sort of settled on this box
[1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:38.080]  Which is all I ever wanted from them was just a better Apple TV that ran apps
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:43.280]  But because it took them so long to settle on it that product also came in hot and didn't have things like you know
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:47.800]  Siri for Apple music didn't have finished versions of the apps on it didn't even get the podcast app out
[1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:51.160]  So that that to me was like it almost like a very strange
[1:45:51.160 --> 1:45:56.480]  Maybe these train just released for Apple in a long time. Yeah, especially given all of the
[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:01.640]  To my you know me at least it's a really strong rumors that it was
[1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:06.240]  Heading into WWDC that it was gonna be announced then and of course, you know
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.240]  We just said how long WWDC was yeah, you know, there wasn't room for it
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:17.880]  But if there was any sort of thought in anybody's head that well maybe Apple TV just got cut from WWDC just because of time
[1:46:17.880 --> 1:46:24.480]  I think the fact that it was as hard for them to get it out by the end of 2015 as it was shows that no
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:25.760]  It just wasn't ready at the time
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:28.880]  Yeah, and again spectacular team super smart people working on it
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:34.480]  But I don't think a clear product direction was set for it early enough in the development cycle. Yeah
[1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:39.600]  I'm liking mine a lot. I really like it
[1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:46.240]  I like my old Apple TV and most of the time that I'm watching TV is spent using Apple TV, you know
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:48.240]  Like guys
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:55.360]  But I find you know as it settles in and now it doesn't feel like the new Apple TV to me anymore
[1:46:55.360 --> 1:47:04.800]  It feels just like this is Apple TV. I really like it a lot. I feel like there's still some fine tuning to be done on the touchpad sensitivity
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:14.560]  But it's you know, I like it a lot. I really really do and I cut the cable cord several years ago
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.920]  And it's the only thing that's connected to my TV now, and I watched it almost all day every day
[1:47:18.920 --> 1:47:22.640]  And my favorite thing about it is that a lot of it can be updated server side
[1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:27.480]  So like the TV app shipped and it really wasn't finished. It didn't do everything that the original TV app did
[1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:33.280]  But over time you you can see it like they used to not they used to sort the order of the shows based on what you
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:36.280]  Purchased even if it was an old show that would never be updated
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:41.600]  It would sit on top and new episodes are coming into other shows and you wouldn't be able to find them and now they fixed all that
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:47.800]  So kind of sorts based on recent episodes and they've added the the Siri for Apple music and they're they're fixing a lot of it
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:50.880]  As it goes and it probably has it's the best example
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.440]  I know it's also an iOS, but it's the best example of my favorite feature this year
[1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:58.160]  Which is last year or the year before it was extensibility in this year
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:02.920]  It's the on-demand resources where they've got this whole philosophy now of all the stuff you use all the time
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:10.240]  Frequently and all the new stuff is gonna be right there available on the flash chip super fast and the stuff you don't use
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:12.960]  We're gonna keep up on the cloud and then bring it down to you when you need it
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.560]  So effectively you have this you have the server side cloud worth of all this content
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:23.920]  But it doesn't slow down your machine when you're using it not like my ps3 which I think took four hours of updates every time
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:25.920]  I turned it on I
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:28.480]  wonder how well
[1:48:28.880 --> 1:48:36.800]  Games are doing it's certain the app store for Apple TV is I would call it vibrant and every time I take a look at it
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:40.480]  There's definitely new stuff and so there's they absolutely have
[1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:43.520]  activity on it
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:46.240]  But our people actually
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:52.120]  Using them. I would say I have to say just to compare and contrast. I would say with the watch
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:55.280]  They absolutely got developers to develop for it
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:49:01.600]  But I don't think many people are using third-party apps on their watch with much frequency
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.840]  No, I agree. It just isn't a great platform for that yet. It's too slow and it's too limited
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:12.840]  Arguably, maybe it won't be the same kind of app platform that the phone is right when they figure it out that might
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:17.280]  May well be and it doesn't necessarily mean that the watch itself as a long-term
[1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:24.080]  Device isn't useful or successful. It just may mean that apps aren't a big part of that with the Apple TV
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:29.040]  I think the potential is clearly there, you know for gaming and and whatever else
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:34.320]  But it's hard to tell. I don't know. I don't know how to gauge that from from our perspective
[1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:38.520]  There's some hard stuff there like they don't include a bundled gamepad in it
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:42.560]  You have to get a third-party gamepad and because of that they changed their minds on whether you had to support
[1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:45.880]  Whether you could just offer exclusive gamepad games originally you could
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:48.320]  But then they said no, you also had to support the Siri remote
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:52.920]  Which led to some gaming compromises and this fantastic. I think ODR is a lot of things
[1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:55.400]  Just don't support it. Yeah, like I don't know if unity or unreal
[1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:59.480]  Support it which means people can't just take their existing games and dump them on Apple TV
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:05.160]  There's a lot of work involved in getting them to do that sort of quick staging for the download and then downloading the additional resources
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:10.800]  ODR meaning the on on demand resources. Yeah, I apologize. Yeah, it's just a way of staging apps
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:15.360]  like the idea of ODR is that you never want someone on their TV to hit a button and say storage is full
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:18.480]  Please delete something because that's a horrible experience on a console
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:20.840]  So you wanted to intelligently manage all that stuff
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:25.360]  But the drawback is it has to download a really small file in the beginning to see how much space there is and
[1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:28.680]  How much else it has to pull down and that means that on the developer side
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:33.280]  They have to go through and part and slice up their app essentially so it can deliver itself in chunks
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:36.880]  And that's new. It's not just taking your existing game and dumping it on the Apple TV
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:44.400]  Yeah, Jonas just ran into that with the the ps4 we have in the house where he got and it's funny because it was
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:47.840]  You got a couple of games
[1:50:47.840 --> 1:50:56.480]  From family members, you know, I outside the family, you know, like Amy's mom got him to play station games and got them on
[1:50:56.480 --> 1:50:59.480]  Disc and I understand like as a gift why that's better
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:04.640]  You know that it's an actual thing you can unwrap and there's a tangableness to it
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:09.080]  But I was thinking in the back of my head. That's sort of a pain in the ass like I kind of you know
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:13.720]  I'm kind of all I'm kind of done with putting discs in the machines to watch movies or play games
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.720]  and
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:22.520]  He was happy about it and I was like, oh, why and he goes well that you know the play station's getting full and
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:26.440]  And in fact when he went to play the one
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:31.880]  He actually for the first time ran into even though the game was given to him on disc
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:39.040]  It actually generated you've got to make room on your playstation because it didn't even have enough space to download the patches
[1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:41.480]  for the game on disc and
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:45.040]  It wasn't a huge issue. I mean we just you know figured out the
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:52.160]  It's just a handful of games that he hasn't played recently. He could get rid of you know once that he had downloaded
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:52:00.680]  And make plenty of room on the I think it has like a 400 gigabyte drive didn't take much but like you said, it's it's not a good experience
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:03.880]  And I kind of feel like long-term
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:09.320]  Again, you know think about this as we go down the road and like you said like no well
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:14.280]  Maybe some of the you know like unity and some of these big gaming things don't support ODR yet
[1:52:14.280 --> 1:52:23.040]  It's not that it's not as important that they support it now is that they support it eventually and within two or three years
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:24.880]  If everybody does
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:32.160]  Apple and you know give Apple TV another two or three years of you know Johnny Srirugi's team's magic
[1:52:32.160 --> 1:52:35.400]  Yes, and I'm not even making you know, I don't want to go down the whole path of
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.400]  What's the point where Apple TV is technically competitive with the dedicated gaming consoles?
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:46.320]  Or a Mac mini for that right, but I think you know
[1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:50.720]  It's it's now wearing the gap and I think it's the sort of thing where it may be it'll never pass it
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:55.800]  But the gap will continue to get narrower and narrower and therefore eventually will be good enough
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.200]  Whether it's you know how good it is as gaming platform now matters
[1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:08.360]  But how good it's going to be overall over the next three four five years is more important and getting ODR support
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:13.560]  Eventually within the next year or two could make a big difference, you know three or four years from now
[1:53:13.880 --> 1:53:18.920]  Yeah, it's clearly a part of Apple's long-term strategy because Apple music it's called nearline and database parlance
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:20.920]  It's basically you prioritize
[1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:23.560]  Frequently accessed in new data over
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:27.280]  infrequently accessed and older data and they do it for Apple music
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:31.920]  They do it for iCloud photo library everything that they're they're building towards an entire environment that sort of
[1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:36.760]  Abstracts away storage so you never have to get that little pop up saying you're out of room
[1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:41.440]  It'll just intelligently almost like a fusion drive. It'll just intelligently manage your storage back and forth
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:47.440]  But the compromises in general are super interesting like they went with 10 100 base T instead of gigabit on the Apple TV
[1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:52.480]  And it's sort of why would they do that but then it turns out that gigabit because of of the speed
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:58.040]  It'll spike a CPU and to result and drop frames on something that's trying to do 60 frames per second 1080p video
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:02.560]  Or gaming so they went with a more conservative chipset because the video they're streaming is not that big
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:07.760]  So they don't need that bandwidth and this gives them a much better control over how much load hits the processor
[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:10.120]  And they didn't go with 4k because 4k
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:15.320]  You know, it's not a lot of penetration yet and HDR might be coming to 4k's so making this box
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:20.120]  It it obsessed a lot of people but at the same time they made a lot of sort of smart decisions
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:22.840]  They way they make with the camera and with other aspects of their products
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:27.080]  Yeah, and I also think that they're designing for
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:35.720]  The main stream and a you know, that's keep this as simple as possible and the truth is very few people I
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:42.760]  If I had to guess very few people are hooking their Apple TV up to ethernet period. It's Wi-Fi all the way
[1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:49.840]  Yeah, and 802.11 AC is better for that because why I still plug my name because I I just don't trust Wi-Fi
[1:54:49.840 --> 1:54:54.800]  Connection is for anything I get super annoyed when it stops and buffers or drops a signal or have to reboot the router
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:00.320]  But for those people 802.11 AC is way more important to have a stable Wi-Fi connection than to have a faster ethernet
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:06.840]  Connection because you notice the problems with Wi-Fi much more than he would with ethernet. Yeah, but you're not the typical, you know, typical person
[1:55:06.840 --> 1:55:08.960]  I mean, I don't know. I would be an interesting thing
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:14.000]  What do you think the percentage of people that's of all the people who've already bought the new Apple TV?
[1:55:15.360 --> 1:55:18.360]  What percentage do you think are on Wi-Fi and
[1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:23.920]  And ethernet I would bet at least 95% are Wi-Fi
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:29.480]  You know in Apple I think you and I were both talking about this at the event Apple has great numbers and all this stuff
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:32.400]  Even if we don't always have them like there's no Bluetooth keyboard support
[1:55:32.400 --> 1:55:36.080]  But it turns out like 2% of people use Bluetooth keyboard and they're all developers
[1:55:36.360 --> 1:55:43.760]  Right, so and so we already list right so we complained like hell about it because we had that we knew that when you hook up a new Apple TV
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:46.920]  You can just take a you know find a Bluetooth keyboard nearby
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:51.680]  And then you can enter all your passwords conveniently and for the MacBook one that we completely forgot to talk about too
[1:55:51.680 --> 1:55:55.920]  Like the there's not a lot of ports, but almost nobody connects their MacBook to an external display
[1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.920]  It's like 4% of people or something, but it's all of us. Yeah, I did forget about the MacBook one
[1:56:00.920 --> 1:56:04.880]  I did too. It's just such a busy year. What was that? That was March, right? Yeah
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.480]  At the same event where the Apple watch was yeah, and research kit. Yeah
[1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:17.640]  Well, hold the thought on that because I'll tie that in to something else
[1:56:24.760 --> 1:56:26.760]  And well, that's
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:29.760]  Where we were talking about Apple TV
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:35.560]  I would say with games. I don't know if it's a hit yet or not
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:41.320]  I kind of feel like they made a mistake by by re-jiggering the rule on whether you can
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:45.640]  Have a game that demands a controller I
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:53.680]  Understand why maybe they wouldn't want to like maybe the fear was that if they allowed that all the games would do it
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:58.720]  And it would make or I think the problem was that if someone bought it and then found out they required a controller
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:02.360]  They'd get upset like there was a hard way of telling people you need a controller to do well
[1:57:02.360 --> 1:57:07.480]  That's that's fixable though in software, right? Like that's not a very difficult
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:11.920]  problem to solve because the Apple TV itself knows whether a
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:15.920]  Gaming controller has been configured for it
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:21.800]  Yeah, and I think they were hoping to have that they just did not have that at launch so it's so it
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:28.680]  It knows, you know, the system knows whether there is a dedicated gaming controller paired with it or not and
[1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:33.360]  If it's not and the app you're trying to buy requires one
[1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:37.880]  It's very easy to put up a prompt that says this game requires a gaming controller
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:40.640]  Do you still want to buy this?
[1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:46.080]  Yes, or no, you know, well, don't don't put yes or no buttons up but buy and cancel
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:48.800]  Don't get me started on yes and no buttons
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:52.960]  Yeah, no, I think that's coming. I just think they don't they didn't have it in place that they flipped the rule
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:58:00.640]  Yeah, I guess maybe that might have been why hopefully what my hope is that they they've changed the rule because it just wasn't ready to
[1:58:00.640 --> 1:58:05.920]  Support it yet and that they fully plan to allow it and you can see from some of the exceptions
[1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:13.640]  They've made that they seem to be leaning in that direction like they do allow you to sell a game that requires a dedicated piece of hardware
[1:58:13.840 --> 1:58:18.120]  Period like guitar hero is allowed to require you to buy
[1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:21.720]  you know the the physical guitar hardware and
[1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:23.720]  and
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:26.400]  Disney infinity is allowed to
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:33.640]  require the little infinity figurines, right? Isn't there infinity there isn't infinity for Apple TV, right? Yes
[1:58:35.320 --> 1:58:40.360]  I'm glad either that I imagined it so they're like Disney infinity is an ingenious
[1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:42.360]  I think an ingenious way to
[1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:46.360]  To make money from a game is
[1:58:46.360 --> 1:58:53.520]  Instead of like in-app purchases like recurring revenue Disney infinity like to unlock characters you actually have to buy
[1:58:53.840 --> 1:58:59.920]  The physical character is like a little action figure. Yeah, it's like Lego dimensions and that other one that I may like you forgetting
[1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:07.120]  So that's allowed in it, but what's not allowed is to require a generic gaming controller period
[1:59:07.120 --> 1:59:11.560]  But clearly some games absolutely positively need it. Yes
[1:59:11.560 --> 1:59:15.440]  You know, and there's some platformers that have come out
[1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:16.600]  I forget the name of the one
[1:59:16.600 --> 1:59:19.680]  But there's a platformer for Apple TV. It's pretty popular
[1:59:19.680 --> 1:59:25.920]  And if you don't have a gaming controller the way their way around it is that the character sort of like just runs automatically
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:30.320]  And it turns into more like a one-button jump type thing
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:36.880]  When but the game is clearly meant to be played like a regular platformer where you can have full control over going left right up down
[1:59:36.880 --> 1:59:38.880]  Yeah, I don't know if we want to get into a whole app store
[1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:47.000]  Tangent now, but it is clearly hitting up against limitations of the old because the app store technology is ancient and it comes from iTunes music days
[1:59:47.000 --> 1:59:49.600]  And it needs to be overhauled and it's a huge process
[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:54.560]  But that you can't even if I right now if I said John is an amazing Apple Apple TV app
[1:59:54.560 --> 1:59:56.040]  I have no way of sending it to you
[1:59:56.040 --> 2:00:00.120]  I have to tell you to go to search and start typing this in and maybe you'll get the right
[2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:07.200]  It there are just so many things you can't do with the Apple TV because it wasn't it's the furthest extreme from what the app store was set up to do
[2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:14.600]  Originally, yeah, I wonder I mean it's just crazy though that there's no way and it's you and I run into this if you're right websites
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:17.000]  where like if
[2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:23.240]  I don't know if electronic arts has a game well if EA calm slash
[2:00:23.640 --> 2:00:28.520]  Name of the game points to their Apple TV game well we can link to their website obviously
[2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:34.960]  But there is no like app Apple TV app store thing that we can link we can't link directly to the
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:39.880]  To the app and even if I do there's no I mean they don't they don't surface webkits
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:42.840]  Webkits a private API and the Apple TV so no one can see that and click lately
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:47.520]  I have to actually physically go and start typing that in on their Apple TV anyway, right right and so
[2:00:47.800 --> 2:00:51.920]  A from the perspective of writing an article about an app or a game for Apple TV
[2:00:51.920 --> 2:00:58.080]  We can't really link to it directly in B if you're at your TV and you want to get to it. You there's no way to
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:02.720]  It is weird. It's a hard problem
[2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:07.000]  I understand I'm not saying this is one of those ones where I laugh because it does seem silly
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:13.280]  But I'm not laughing because there's an obvious solution staring us in the face and it just seems incomprehensible that they didn't
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:18.560]  You know just do X it's a long-standing issue like if I'm on during fireball and you recommend a great Mac app
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:22.560]  But I'm looking on my iPhone. I can hit that Mac app store like it doesn't help me at all
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:25.800]  The Apple watch gets around it because it's it's a slave device right now
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:29.840]  So or companion device right now. So it just transfers the app back and forth
[2:01:29.840 --> 2:01:32.440]  But I can't really get stuff off. You know, I can download to iTunes
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:38.120]  But it's it's sort of horrible and it makes you think that there has to be something under a way to allow for cross-platform
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:43.600]  And even web-based purchases because there are all those iTunes preview pages up there and we just we just haven't gotten there
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:48.320]  Yes, yeah, it seems like you ought to be able to do some things that
[2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:52.840]  You know the path forward would be something like
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:02:01.480]  The way with the Kindle that you tell me about this great book and send me a link to the Kindle page
[2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:05.360]  For the book and I'm my Kindle isn't even with me
[2:02:05.360 --> 2:02:08.280]  You know my physical Kindle hardware is at home and I'm at work
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:12.040]  I can go and buy it now and Amazon will just say where do you want this to go?
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:16.800]  And I can say just send it to my you know send it to my Kindle and when I get home there it is
[2:02:16.800 --> 2:02:18.800]  It's already on my Kindle
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:23.920]  It seems like you ought to be able to do something like that with your Apple TV where you ought to be able to if you're on a computer
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:26.960]  There should be a web version of the
[2:02:27.800 --> 2:02:32.880]  Apple TV App Store that if you're signed into your iTunes account you can just you know
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:37.400]  Buy an app or download it to your Apple TV right from there
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:44.000]  Absolutely and you can even put up a prompt if you when you go to Apple TV said you began a purchase on this
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:48.600]  Do you want to confirm this purchase now and you press yes, and it just downloads if they're really worried about you know
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:50.720]  People buying things by accident for the wrong platform
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:54.120]  But it and it likens me as iTunes is is archaic
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.240]  But it's got billions and billions of dollars of transactions going over it
[2:02:57.240 --> 2:02:59.160]  So it's hard to just to just change it
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:04.400]  But it's it's a bridge that is sort of old and crumbly and they have to make sure that that second that new bridge is
[2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:07.960]  Fully built out and then sort of carefully to redirect traffic onto it
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:09.440]  It's not going to be an easy swap
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:16.240]  But I really hope sort of like how Apple calm this year had that big change where stored at Apple calm disappeared and suddenly it was on modern
[2:03:16.240 --> 2:03:21.120]  Website with everything integrated. I really hope the same thing is has been going on for iTunes and one day
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:27.880]  They just flip a switch and we have a modern you know elegant version of the entire iTunes store stack for all the devices
[2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:34.640]  I still get thrown off by the new store dot Apple dot com because it's I'm so it's so ingrained in me
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:40.360]  Yeah, you have to go to a separate website to to buy stuff at Apple or see the prices for them or something like that
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:45.440]  And the fact that you don't know but you know it's I click the shopping bag all the time expected to be a store there
[2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:46.720]  Just empty
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:51.400]  That's a transition of that that team that that's the sort of thing because it in hindsight
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:55.320]  It feels like wow, this is the way it always should have been that the team that did the work on that
[2:03:55.320 --> 2:03:59.840]  It's easy to overlook just how hard that is to to change something that again
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.120]  Like you said, that's billions of dollars going through it and make a change like that and have it come off as well as it
[2:04:05.760 --> 2:04:10.720]  Yeah, just oh again, we woke up and it changed and that that's pretty much exactly what you want to have happen with that stuff
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:15.680]  You know before I do the last I have one more sponsor tonight, but before we do that we should talk from
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:23.000]  From the the September we didn't mention the iPhone 6S yet or the iPad Pro or the iPad Pro
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:30.060]  The 6S I you know, it's
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:33.160]  Fantastic, I don't think there's much to talk about in hindsight
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:39.360]  I mean it's a terrific year-over-year upgrade versus the six most people don't buy them one year after another
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:46.800]  But just in terms of keeping the incremental year-over-year. It just keeps getting better every year progress moving forward
[2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:50.320]  It's it's about as good an update as Apple's ever done
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:53.960]  Yeah, and I think it's it's once again an example of of the
[2:04:54.160 --> 2:04:58.000]  You know because Apple goes to incredible lens with these phones and this year it looks the same
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:02.320]  But it's got 7,000 series aluminum the screen looks the same, but it's got double density
[2:05:02.320 --> 2:05:10.480]  Chemically treated glass. It is almost to the atom completely redesigned. It's got the Taptic engine inside at the A9 processor inside it
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:17.720]  It's got all the new rigidity to support the 3D touch because you're actually deforming the glass on a microscopic level to trigger
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:21.760]  The the pressure sensitivity in the phone. It's got all these really
[2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:25.600]  Cool elements in it, but on the outside it looks like last year's phone
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:28.640]  I think you know and again
[2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:35.360]  Maybe I'll sing a different tune a year from now, but I do think if for somebody who is on a two-year a very much more typical
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:41.680]  Two-year upgrade cycle than the idiotic throw money away every year one-year upgrade cycle that you and I are on
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.720]  I think the S year is the better year to be on
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.960]  Yeah, well last time it was touch ID time before that it was Siri
[2:05:52.960 --> 2:06:02.560]  Well, and just little things like the lack of bendability like I think the bendgate clearly with a year ago was overblown
[2:06:03.520 --> 2:06:04.640]  but it is true
[2:06:04.640 --> 2:06:10.640]  You know fundamentally it is true that with a certain amount of pressure you could bend the iPhone and the metal bands
[2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:13.920]  Yeah, it was physics and that some people were running into it in
[2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:20.360]  Non-extreme circumstances, you know that they weren't trying to be a jackass and purposefully bend it
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:25.880]  But it did get bent and it doesn't you know this phone doesn't for a couple of reasons, you know for the increase
[2:06:25.880 --> 2:06:32.600]  You know the the new aluminum different structures inside that you know little things like that just I don't think there was a single
[2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:35.720]  Foe scandal with the success
[2:06:35.720 --> 2:06:42.760]  They put the two different processes was the closest we got. Yeah, the right the closest regard was that they were sourcing the CPUs
[2:06:43.400 --> 2:06:44.120]  from
[2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:50.280]  What TSMC yeah Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing and from Samsung and from Samsung and somebody
[2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:56.200]  Initially came out with some sort of benchmark where where the Samsung one was worse
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:01.080]  Well, so it was interesting. It's it's an example of how like a little knowledge is dangerous and
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:06.360]  chipsets have multiple characteristics and multiple dimensions and on on on on an
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:13.640]  Art of synthetic test you could run those chips flat out and because of various things including the the die size and the different
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:17.800]  Manufacturing and how they those chips work you could deplete the Samsung chip faster
[2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.920]  But that's only measuring how fast you can deplete it running at maximum
[2:07:20.920 --> 2:07:23.640]  You're not saying well this chip is running hotter for a longer period of time
[2:07:23.880 --> 2:07:26.600]  It's almost like you have two sprinters and one is quicker off the gate
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:31.880]  But the other one is stronger and the finish and you're trying to you're trying to measure two seconds in who's the better who's a better sprinter
[2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:36.280]  Right that was it though the Foe scandal was that the Samsung one would run your battery lower
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:39.800]  Yeah, you got less battery life with the sound which which is truly an eccentric benchmark
[2:07:39.800 --> 2:07:45.160]  But not true in real life right, and I feel like even I I seem to recall that even this synthetic benchmark that was used
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:49.080]  You know other people ran it later and didn't get results anywhere near as dramatic
[2:07:49.240 --> 2:07:54.440]  The differences but it wasn't anywhere near as profound as initially thought being on different cell towers would lead to is
[2:07:54.440 --> 2:08:00.440]  As significant a difference as running those tests on those chipsets. All right, so I do feel like you know
[2:08:00.520 --> 2:08:02.680]  If you're only if you're only gonna get one every other year
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:05.640]  You're better off on the S cycle than than on S cycle
[2:08:05.640 --> 2:08:09.800]  So that was one of the most interesting stories for me this year was Apple's beginning that iPhone upgrade program
[2:08:09.800 --> 2:08:14.440]  Where they're starting to move like to starting to cater people who do want to get a new iPhone every year
[2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:19.080]  And also sort of building up there the trick for this is that you have to hand in your old iPhone
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:20.840]  Which they can then sell in emerging markets
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:25.320]  So it's sort of it helps out with their price differential in in those emerging markets
[2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:28.520]  But it also stays here to the people who do want the new iPhone every year
[2:08:28.680 --> 2:08:30.520]  And it's I know people say this almost arcastically
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:34.840]  But it is iPhone as a service almost yeah, well and I would compare it to
[2:08:34.840 --> 2:08:38.200]  The very well established market and
[2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:41.160]  you know high-end on you know very
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:45.240]  lucrative market of automobiles and that leasing is
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:51.480]  Long been established as something that the carb makers themselves that the car dealers themselves offer you
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:58.280]  I hear it, you know, I've been as I start thinking about the fact that professionally
[2:08:58.280 --> 2:09:02.360]  I'm seems as though I might be writing about cars sooner rather than later
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:09.400]  I've started paying a little bit more attention and I've noticed that a lot of car advertisements only talk about leasing prices
[2:09:10.520 --> 2:09:12.520]  and you know, it's
[2:09:15.480 --> 2:09:21.560]  It's exactly analogous there's absolutely no difference except that that the iPhone costs
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:26.520]  You know like 800 to a thousand dollars and cars cost, you know
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:28.600]  20 to a hundred thousand dollars
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:32.040]  And that was sort of one of the funny other faux scandals was everyone was panicking
[2:09:32.040 --> 2:09:34.920]  What's Apple gonna do now that all the carriers in the U.S. have changed their structure?
[2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:37.880]  They're not gonna be able to hide the price of the iPhone every year
[2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:43.320]  Ignoring that you know a Samsung Android phone the high-end Android phones cost the same price that an iPhone
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:44.600]  So it's a universal problem
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.080]  But also Apple and the carriers are never gonna let that upfront sticker price show it a consumer's
[2:09:49.160 --> 2:09:52.920]  They're gonna have all these different deals that you'll be able to partake in yeah, it's
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:10:00.600]  It's the worry over that was there's obviously some interesting thinking going on and it is somebody's problem to solve in the
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.440]  Manage, but it is definitely a manageable problem
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:11.320]  You know and the fact that you see BMW commercials or you hear John Ham, you know pitching it Mercedes commercials
[2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:15.960]  And then the dollar amount that you hear at the end is you know $400 or something like that
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:19.400]  Well, you know, it's they're not they're not talking about this
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:22.920]  Yeah, they don't tell you that's the cost on a Mercedes. Yeah, that it's you know
[2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:27.480]  $83,000 to walk, you know to just bite and cash off a lot even now they'll say it's like
[2:10:28.040 --> 2:10:30.040]  $279 every two weeks. Yeah
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:43.000]  But it's definitely you know manageable and it's definitely what you know that to me is the shift that it's
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:47.320]  You know, it's you know, it's obviously more of a financial
[2:10:47.320 --> 2:10:53.160]  Strategy than a product strategy and it's the product stuff that interests me more about the iPhone and Apple
[2:10:53.160 --> 2:10:57.480]  But you know, it's definitely interesting and I definitely think it's part of the part of the
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:04.680]  You know, and it's like you said that it's just a generic sense that it's not just nerds like us who want a new iPhone
[2:11:04.680 --> 2:11:10.520]  Every year that maybe I am maybe I'm overstating just how how rare you and I you know people like us are in terms of that
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:15.160]  That is that sort of becoming more of a mass market mindset. Well, Apple is learning that
[2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:18.120]  I mean these we saw that with the gold color iPhone 5S and it turned out
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:21.800]  You know people cared more about having the new color than a lot of other things and now the rose gold
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:25.880]  iPhone 6S people really want to have the color of the shows that they have the new iPhone
[2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:29.240]  Right, and we're gonna be going into the iPhone 7 and a history repeats itself
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:34.520]  We're gonna have a new design now and that that usually is another tripping point for a bunch of people to upgrade again
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:36.520]  Tim Cook said I think it was
[2:11:36.840 --> 2:11:40.760]  Still only 30 or 40% of people had upgraded to it to a new iPhone
[2:11:40.760 --> 2:11:45.640]  Hmm, so they have a huge potential market not only in people switching from Android or getting their first phone
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:48.920]  But also in people turning over those iPhones. Yeah
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:56.760]  But other than that, I don't know how much to say about the iPhone success great iPhone. Yeah, it's you know great. That's it
[2:11:59.000 --> 2:12:02.280]  iPad Pro should we save it for the next segment. Sure. All right
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:09.800]  Our last sponsor to their final sponsor is our good friends the Brower group
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:12.840]  Now their app
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:16.920]  You bar to launched on the talk show last year, and it was a great success
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:23.800]  So they're back with the new you bar three. That's just spelled you like a lowercase you just think of it like the apple
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:26.840]  I a lowercase you and then an uppercase BAR
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:33.000]  It is a doc replacement for the Mac. So we're talking. This is like good old-fashioned
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:38.280]  Nerdy type of thing that people who listen to the talk show utility app for the Mac
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:43.240]  The purpose of you bar is to vastly increase your productivity
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:45.320]  Pro users love it
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:52.760]  And they also use it to help family members or switchers because one of the things that you bar does is you can configure it and like any good
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:59.560]  Nerd utility. It is very configurable super configurable. So one of the ways you can do it is you can make it run like the
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:01.000]  Mac doc
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:03.160]  But like with extra features and stuff like that
[2:13:03.480 --> 2:13:08.040]  But you can also set it up to run as a windows taskbar style doc
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:10.680]  So for people in your family who maybe have switched
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:15.000]  To the Mac recently and one of the things that they struggle with are the ways
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:19.240]  All the various things that they did through the windows taskbar that are different through the Mac
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:22.440]  You can set you bar up to run that way and
[2:13:23.480 --> 2:13:27.800]  No matter how you can figure it it looks great just like any great Mac utility
[2:13:28.680 --> 2:13:32.360]  It doesn't sacrifice visual design
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:36.040]  and aesthetic beauty just for the sake of
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:43.480]  You know nerd type features, you know if you want that type of type if you want something ugly to do like that
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:45.960]  You know go go install Ubuntu or something like that
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:50.520]  This is for people who use the Mac and want their stuff to look beautiful. So all sorts of shortcuts
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:53.560]  Here's some of the nerdy stuff you can do hold down control when you click on an app
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:57.560]  And you can see the CPU and RAM usage for that app hold down shift
[2:13:57.560 --> 2:14:03.080]  And you can quit any app or close any of the individual windows that are open within that app just by clicking it
[2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:08.120]  Unresponsive apps if you have an app that needs to be forced quit get some red background already
[2:14:08.120 --> 2:14:13.240]  So you can see it without even checking, you know the force quit, you know command option escape
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:15.240]  window
[2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:17.800]  And all sorts of customizability you can
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:21.080]  Adjust the sizes there's themes you can
[2:14:21.560 --> 2:14:24.600]  Just like the way that the system has light and dark themes. So does you bar
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:30.680]  You can even create your own custom theme. So it's almost getting into like kaleidoscope territory
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:36.120]  You name it. It's got it. I can't tell you everything about it
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:39.960]  Just go to the website and check it out, but it's absolutely worth a look and that's it you bar
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:43.000]  UBA or app.com and
[2:14:43.640 --> 2:14:47.800]  Remember the coupon code. The coupon code is retna ruber
[2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:50.440]  retina
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:52.760]  Gruber remember that and you'll save
[2:14:54.680 --> 2:14:59.080]  50% off it's 20 bucks ordinarily great price for a utility this this series
[2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:04.440]  But with that code you save 50% you only pay 10 bucks 10 bucks. You got a great app
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:10.760]  And one more thing maybe you remember this from when they sponsored to show before this is crazy to me
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:15.000]  But the developer of this app
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:25.720]  Edward Brower that's where the Brower group gets the name from in addition to being a great app developer with a great sense of design and stuff like this
[2:15:26.040 --> 2:15:29.880]  As a side job, I laugh because this just seems crazy he
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:33.320]  designs and manufacturers
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:36.840]  His own beautiful mechanical watches
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:43.320]  He's a watchmaker in addition to making an app and he already launched his newest timepiece
[2:15:43.320 --> 2:15:48.280]  It's called the mirage and it's available in three colors on the earlier episode of the show
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:54.680]  Each one is a limited edition of only 300 pieces and they all come with an engraved number on the back
[2:15:56.040 --> 2:16:01.000]  Really really beautiful design on the dial my very favorite thing about this watch is the dial design
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:05.400]  The way or at least the dial combined with the hands really really love it
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:11.160]  beautiful typography really nice really nice just just the
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:20.040]  The layout and the proportions and the diameter is very very reasonable 40 millimeter diameter
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:25.800]  This is not a big hack and giant watch which a lot of modern mechanical watches are
[2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:30.600]  You just have to see yourself and hit the web. There's a separate website for that
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:35.560]  Brower B-R-A-W-E-R timepieces.com and
[2:16:36.120 --> 2:16:40.440]  exact same code retina Gruber. You don't need to remember memorize a separate code
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:44.040]  Now this is a serious watch is a mechanical watch the retail price
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:47.640]  $750 to great price for a mechanical watch
[2:16:47.720 --> 2:16:49.800]  It's a lot if you're a casual risk buyer
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:55.400]  But this is totally totally within the realm of what a handmade mechanical watch is meant to cost
[2:16:55.400 --> 2:16:57.400]  But if you use that code retina Gruber
[2:16:58.440 --> 2:17:00.440]  40% off and
[2:17:00.440 --> 2:17:04.600]  Shipping is free in the US and Canada so go check them out you bar app.com
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:07.160]  Brower timepieces.com
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.760]  And on both of them you'll save a lot of dough if you use the code retina Gruber
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:18.680]  Love this guy. He's a really he's also a very very nice guy Edward Brower
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:24.520]  And I've been emailing him about a little app that he's working on on the side next thing coming up
[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:26.040]  Very very nice guy thoughtful guy
[2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:28.040]  But I kind of hate him because he makes me feel
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:33.400]  Like it's the same way that I get so angry at you sometimes like when you are so productive and you know
[2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:35.080]  Like I feel like I struggle to get like
[2:17:35.720 --> 2:17:39.240]  Like one or two good pieces on daring fireball and
[2:17:39.800 --> 2:17:42.040]  Podcast out in a week and then you have like
[2:17:42.280 --> 2:17:45.960]  7,000 words on I'm more in a comprehensive review of a new thing
[2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:49.240]  That only came out the day before and like four or five podcasts
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:55.000]  So you make me angry, but this guy makes me angry or because he's he's running a full-time software business
[2:17:55.400 --> 2:18:01.480]  With a great app the differences between you bar two and three are humongous. It is absolutely
[2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:07.640]  Remarkable he's got a remarkable amount of new features in there and a remarkably short number amount of time
[2:18:08.200 --> 2:18:10.200]  And in the meantime he also makes
[2:18:10.200 --> 2:18:15.240]  Really nuts and watches are legit. I went and took a look at them after the last spot and they're amazing
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:19.320]  It's don't understand. I don't understand how he does that
[2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:24.600]  They run us on his people. Yeah, it makes me mad. I feel like it makes me feel like I'm running in slow motion
[2:18:25.800 --> 2:18:29.080]  Apple the iPad pro. Yeah
[2:18:30.520 --> 2:18:31.480]  I
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:36.120]  Don't really have much to say about I think it is absolutely remarkable. I think it is
[2:18:36.120 --> 2:18:40.440]  It is maybe the best single best of
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.000]  iOS device
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  That's been made. I mean, I don't know how it's kind of a hard thing to settle
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:53.720]  I mean, I could make the case for the iPhone success to I could also make the case maybe for the iPad mini four
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:57.160]  Which we forgot to mention that came out in September
[2:18:58.680 --> 2:19:03.080]  Just like it's a great tablet, too. It is we just we got one for Jonas
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:10.360]  Upgrading a very old iPad for him and just looking at it. It's perfect. It is I especially it
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:14.280]  It's to me the difference between the mini and the
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  iPad air is
[2:19:17.400 --> 2:19:21.640]  Are you old enough that you that you want things to be bigger visually?
[2:19:22.120 --> 2:19:24.760]  Because it's the exact same number of pixels and the layouts identically
[2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:27.800]  You don't have to do anything as a developer to to to do for that
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:30.920]  It's just you want it smaller. You want it big and I'm at the point now
[2:19:30.920 --> 2:19:33.560]  You know with the eye medical issues aside, too
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:36.840]  But just at at the age that I'm at I kind of want the bigger one
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:43.160]  It doesn't have the X in the processor either, but I mean there's so few people are gonna actually put it to that limit
[2:19:43.400 --> 2:19:46.920]  But for someone like you know for someone like Jonas who has you know
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:53.320]  Perfect vision that it's an 11-year-old or almost 12-year-old. It's clearly the better iPad for him. He loves it. I mean
[2:19:53.720 --> 2:19:55.720]  absolutely adores the size
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:19:57.560]  I
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:01.080]  Can make the case for that, too, but the iPad pro it
[2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:05.480]  It's the performance on the device that just sort of
[2:20:05.960 --> 2:20:10.520]  Starles me. I was joking. I picked mine up in New York like I like I think you did in it on the way back
[2:20:10.520 --> 2:20:14.360]  I passed by the Microsoft store and I could hear all those Intel processors just
[2:20:15.240 --> 2:20:19.720]  Crying and maybe trying to jump off the table. I I want to write about this
[2:20:20.760 --> 2:20:22.760]  Soon because I think it's been
[2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:30.280]  I think people have taken it the wrong way is is the angle of the that that this spells
[2:20:31.400 --> 2:20:35.240]  Doom for Intel in the long run and it's not
[2:20:36.120 --> 2:20:43.320]  And I know part of my argument for this as just making a just like a sanity check and not just going by gut feeling or what I
[2:20:43.320 --> 2:20:45.640]  You know what I think makes for an interesting story
[2:20:46.200 --> 2:20:52.600]  But actually trying to measure it as using like geek bench scores and just showing that the iPad pro beats the
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:54.600]  MacBook one
[2:20:57.400 --> 2:21:02.600]  But I mean it's hard because this was a really good year for Apple Silicon the Apple the A9 is there is a real leap forward
[2:21:02.600 --> 2:21:04.600]  Where Intel really struggle to get
[2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:09.640]  The the 10 nanometer process out and to get broad well because there's a broad well
[2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:15.000]  Why which is core M I think is a marketing term in the MacBook and it's not a great chip
[2:21:15.240 --> 2:21:20.520]  So the iPad pro hit hit it out the park while Intel during a year that Intel was struggling
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:25.240]  So that and that's a great point, but I think that it's more it's not so much like
[2:21:27.080 --> 2:21:33.080]  One test of these two devices at this snapshot in time, but it's the overall trend line
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:39.160]  And in the way that like intersecting trend lines over a long period of time
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:42.440]  At the point where they intersect maybe that you know
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:45.960]  Maybe next year the MacBook one is faster than next year's iPad pro
[2:21:45.960 --> 2:21:51.720]  But if it isn't won't be by much and three four five years from now. I don't think there's any question
[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:56.360]  And there's also the issue of being fast enough
[2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:02.680]  You know that it's it doesn't even matter whether there's other max or MacBooks that get faster
[2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:08.200]  And just in terms of looking at the trend line like just go back three four five years and look at the original
[2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:14.120]  iPad or the iPad two or even the iPad three and where they stood performance wise compared to
[2:22:14.120 --> 2:22:18.840]  The MacBook errors of the time and it was no comparison
[2:22:18.840 --> 2:22:22.840]  They were they you know in terms of anything that you would measure like on geek bench or something like that
[2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:24.120]  They were behind
[2:22:24.280 --> 2:22:29.480]  But that gap has narrowed steadily and steadily as years go by the I the the a nine
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:33.160]  chips and
[2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:40.680]  Arm chips in general industry-wide are getting better faster than Intel chips because the scale is
[2:22:40.680 --> 2:22:43.560]  Just so much bigger. I think it's also
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:48.360]  Again, Apple has considerable advantage in that they make their own chips
[2:22:48.360 --> 2:22:52.920]  Intel has to sell those chips at a profit and they have to support a variety of different like that
[2:22:52.920 --> 2:22:57.160]  Just run windows they have to run Linux. They have to run OS 10 and you look at something like the a nine
[2:22:57.640 --> 2:23:01.000]  X and it can run for sort of three four k streams at the same time
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:05.080]  And that would just grind a lot of Intel even Intel based max into the ground
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:05.960]  It just can't do that
[2:23:05.960 --> 2:23:10.840]  But Apple built those chips to do it. They can purpose build all those chips for exactly what they want to do
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:15.160]  And that gives them an incredible amount of flexibility and even in arm. I mean Qualcomm
[2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:18.680]  It's just been struggling Samsung has been struggling their own fab
[2:23:18.680 --> 2:23:22.280]  They should arguably have way better chips than Apple that they just don't have the designers
[2:23:22.440 --> 2:23:23.800]  Apple's got great designers
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:26.280]  They've got the advantage of building exactly for their hardware
[2:23:26.520 --> 2:23:29.240]  I mean if they could run on Intel's 10-nanometer process
[2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.080]  I think we'd have the best chips in the world. Then we already do but we'd have even better ones
[2:23:33.080 --> 2:23:40.920]  It's a good question. It's such an interesting question as to what how can Samsung manufacture these for Apple?
[2:23:40.920 --> 2:23:47.880]  But can't do it for themselves. It's the same reason why the candle imports on a galaxy phone. They just it's just not something
[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:49.880]  That's partly they just don't have the people
[2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:59.000]  It really is to me just eye opening when you use the iPad Pro that you know that my complaints about it
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:03.480]  Trying to use it instead of a MacBook are almost entirely software-based
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:07.080]  It's just the design of iOS itself to me not being
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:14.280]  Condusive to the sort of things. I want to do on a Mac in terms of how do I take advantage of this big screen and how does you know
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:20.840]  Like as much as I do like the split screen stuff that they've added to iOS 9 but to me it's not as
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:28.040]  It's still not as useful as the way that I can have multiple things on screen at once on on a Mac
[2:24:28.840 --> 2:24:31.000]  And as I wrote my review
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.200]  I I'm frustrated at the lack of keyboard
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:41.080]  Navigability that if you're supposed to fundamentally be able to use this device if you want while it's hooked up to a keyboard
[2:24:41.640 --> 2:24:45.960]  I don't want to have to reach up and touch the screen to do some things because it's
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:50.840]  It really is exactly as Apple's been telling us for a long time ergonomically
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:55.080]  Terrible. Yeah, my understanding is a lot of that stuff just didn't make the cut for iOS 9
[2:24:55.080 --> 2:24:57.080]  But it it has been and will be worked on
[2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:03.560]  Yeah, I sense that it has to be. Yeah, and I've heard from some some friends within the company
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.800]  You know that that absolutely some of these things are a frustration
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:11.960]  Like including the thing I observed about the fact that
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:17.640]  When you command tab the multitasking goes from left to right because they just
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:23.800]  Put like a brain dead port of the Mac command tab switcher in and the new
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:32.200]  System wide like double click the home button and touch the screen switcher goes right to left in terms of most recent to to oldest
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:35.880]  Even though the old built-in switcher
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:40.280]  That was there for iOS 7 and 8 was left to right
[2:25:40.280 --> 2:25:46.200]  Yeah, you're colliding with the force press the force swipe and not on the iPhone 6s there because they wanted that
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:51.160]  The back gesture goes from left to right and so the the force right gesture had to go from left to right
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:55.560]  And you know the what I heard after I wrote about some of the stuff is yeah, we know
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:58.280]  Well, they hit it first
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:00.360]  I mean the best thing about the iPad pro right now
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:04.840]  And if you look at the 60 minutes like when how many of the executive team members had iPad pros in front of them
[2:26:05.080 --> 2:26:09.000]  Is that it anything that it's gonna be almost like this Steve Jobs days where anything that doesn't work
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:11.880]  It's gonna get immediate executive attention. I don't trust that though
[2:26:12.120 --> 2:26:19.400]  I would just say that I don't trust anything I saw in that in the 60-minute thing as indicative of what they actually use
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:22.680]  I wouldn't be surprised, but I wouldn't I would take it all with a grain of salt
[2:26:22.920 --> 2:26:24.440]  Absolutely stage management
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:28.040]  Although apparently some of them do like that that has become at least for now. They're go-to machine
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:32.440]  Oh, I wouldn't be surprised. You know, and I think it's a tremendous like and at you know
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:35.880]  A meeting sit to you know situation is tremendous
[2:26:35.880 --> 2:26:40.120]  It's almost where you'd rather have a device that is less likely to distract you
[2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:43.800]  And if you just want to put up a note to happen have it be full screen and
[2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:46.840]  I think it's tremendous for a scenario like that
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:53.640]  And it's interesting as a device because we are hitting this point where the MacBook has gone down to be as close as possible to an iPad
[2:26:53.640 --> 2:27:00.520]  And the iPad has gone up to be as close as possible to a MacBook, but both of them both of them are still very separate things like the MacBook
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.080]  Doesn't have any any real touch awareness. It's not a touch friendly environment
[2:27:05.080 --> 2:27:12.120]  It's not really a mobile friendly environment and likewise your frustrations with the keyboard on iOS and even those split screen is nice
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:18.040]  There's no multi window. There's no drag and drop. There aren't any of these conventions that are basically muscle memory to people like us now
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:22.840]  And you sort of there's no middle ground. You have to pick a side and neither side is perfect
[2:27:26.840 --> 2:27:28.840]  I saw somebody on Twitter the other day
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.640]  Was posted a little video where they just said hey finally saw the iPad pro
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:37.560]  You know, it's like somebody who hadn't seen one in a story yet, and it was like here's how I tried
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:42.440]  You know not trying to be a jerk, but they videotaped it with their they you know the shot video with their iPhone
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.520]  Here's me trying to to attach a photo to a mail and they had mail on the left and
[2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:51.160]  Photos on the right and they tried to
[2:27:51.880 --> 2:27:54.040]  Tap and hold on a photo and then drag it over
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  Across that divide and of course it didn't work
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:28:03.320]  Yeah, again, you got to figure that stuff is being worked on but it's like do you touch and hold you for like what is going to be the
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:09.720]  Affordance for that sort of activity and it's and they have to make sure it doesn't collide with all the other gestures that are that are being used in iOS
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:11.480]  But I think all that is coming I
[2:28:11.480 --> 2:28:15.480]  The last time I was on I think we spoke about I have this long-standing desire for iPad OS
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:19.400]  But I think the same way there's watch OS the watch goddess distinct thing and there's out
[2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:24.520]  There's TV OS and the Apple TV goddess distinct thing. I'm glad that that the iPad is getting some features now
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:29.320]  But I still think it needs it needs that concept of keep backboard keep frontboard
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:35.320]  But take springboard and think of something that really is tablet first and it takes advantage of things like the iPad Pro
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:39.800]  Yeah, and that's the sort of thing it was definitely the last time you were on the show
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:42.360]  I couldn't agree more in fact. I agree more
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:47.240]  I agreed then I agree even more now that it's whether they asked what they'd call it
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:49.320]  No, I don't think they should call it that just call it iOS
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:53.240]  But what it should be fundamentally though is iPad OS is what if
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:29:01.080]  iOS was meant only for the iPad. What would it what should it be like and how do we do that? How do we get from here to there?
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:06.280]  The iPad suffers the same problem with the Mac App Store does and that has a much more successful sibling
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:09.320]  So when you get resources they go to the iOS App Store when you get resources
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:12.040]  It goes to the iPhone and they're ported up to the iPad
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:15.400]  And now that we have broken through with split view and with some of the keyboard stuff
[2:29:15.400 --> 2:29:20.840]  I hope that that continues and I know there's it's one of those things where people inside Apple have the same arguments
[2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:25.480]  That we have outside of Apple and I just and I just hope that those people start to get more
[2:29:25.480 --> 2:29:27.480]  Sway within it because I think as a device
[2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:31.160]  If Apple is confident that this is the future of personal computing for them
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:37.320]  I think they really need to give it the attention it deserves and that that brings us to the single most important product that Apple
[2:29:37.480 --> 2:29:39.480]  introduced in 2015
[2:29:40.280 --> 2:29:41.480]  The
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:43.480]  Smart battery case
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:49.720]  I've been forcing myself to use it for the last week and I switched away from the iPhone 6
[2:29:50.360 --> 2:29:52.680]  S plus and when he is in the success with the battery case
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:30:00.120]  Do you would you see if I if you got used to the plus and if you like the plus
[2:30:00.120 --> 2:30:03.640]  I can't see how you would how you can I don't but I want it to
[2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:09.160]  I like to make sure that when I when I review a product that I go back and actually because it's impossible to review a product properly
[2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:12.440]  When you first get it because there's enormous pressure to get that review up
[2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:14.440]  And like not pressure from Apple or anybody
[2:30:14.680 --> 2:30:18.840]  But just people don't care anymore after a couple weeks. I won't even bother reading it
[2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:24.120]  So I wanted to take a look at it and I wanted to understand it because if you want a bigger built-in battery you get the iPhone
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:29.360]  Success plus. It's what it's there for and it's nice because it's elongated and it dissipates
[2:30:29.360 --> 2:30:34.160]  He really well, but there's a whole sort of and people think that Apple wants to make lighter phones
[2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:37.120]  They don't they want to make thinner phones. They want to make lighter phones
[2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:41.320]  They want to make phones that have great radio reception. There's all sorts of trade-offs that you have to do when you have
[2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:44.000]  Things like batteries and things like radios and phones
[2:30:44.600 --> 2:30:49.000]  So the iPhone 6 I think Apple again is very sincere when they say that for some people
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:52.960]  It just it just wasn't enough to do things that were more than an average day
[2:30:52.960 --> 2:30:56.440]  They wanted to give them the option and if you build that in you can't take it off
[2:30:56.440 --> 2:31:00.280]  If you have a heavy phone that's twice as thick you can't pull that off when you don't need it
[2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:05.080]  So you make a case and then you want the case as one piece and you want a case that doesn't interfere with their radio
[2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:10.960]  Maybe it even makes the radio better because that way the radio doesn't have to ramp up and use even more power when it's got a battery case on
[2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:15.440]  Because that defeats the purpose of a battery case and you sort of go through the requirements of it
[2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:17.840]  And you end up with the case that doesn't look great
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:21.320]  But works really really well and then you get this
[2:31:22.320 --> 2:31:27.440]  Previously as Apple only cares about design. They don't care about functionality and they make something really functional and immediately to get
[2:31:27.440 --> 2:31:29.940]  Slammed for the design of it. I think is endlessly interesting. I
[2:31:31.240 --> 2:31:38.720]  Spent you know definitely a full week with it. I think we've been longer and I was wearing it all the time and I keep thinking if there's one thing
[2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:46.240]  I wish I'd I wish I'd mentioned in my piece writing about it is maybe a little bit more emphasis on
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:52.480]  Feel what it feels like as opposed to what it looks like because it definitely looks and I you know I
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:31:59.480]  Don't I don't think I held back. I think I called it funny looking weird looking. It's definitely a weird looking. I called it awkward and ugly
[2:31:59.480 --> 2:32:08.640]  But it definitely doesn't feel bad and I without question think that it feels better in hand than any of the mofie cases
[2:32:08.640 --> 2:32:14.520]  That I've ever tried because they make the phone feel entirely fat from yes left to right
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:15.920]  They make you stretch your hand over it
[2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:18.920]  Where this one the hump sort of fills into your palm and your fingers go on either side
[2:32:18.920 --> 2:32:24.860]  So I I would argue and you know if somebody clearly this is the realm of subjectivity if somebody else would disagree
[2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:29.360]  Sure, yeah, but I feel very confident arguing that it that for me at least I think for many others
[2:32:29.360 --> 2:32:36.800]  It feels better than a mofie style case and if somebody else wants to argue that it looks worse to them
[2:32:36.800 --> 2:32:39.720]  I wouldn't disagree and I you know that's subjective
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:41.960]  But that you know
[2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:47.160]  And I think Joanna Stern said it best in her you all battery charging cases are ugly
[2:32:47.160 --> 2:32:51.200]  They are in one way or another and apples is not an exception
[2:32:51.200 --> 2:32:58.080]  It's a really it's as to date an unsolved problem to make a case that is a battery that will
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:03.320]  Contain the significant charge for the battery that isn't ugly and and thick
[2:33:03.880 --> 2:33:05.240]  It's like the headset Jack
[2:33:05.240 --> 2:33:07.560]  Yeah, like right now a lot of headphones won't fit into it
[2:33:07.560 --> 2:33:11.040]  But what do you do you can't make a bigger hole because you destroy the structure of the bottom of the phone
[2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:17.680]  The the your problems that you just can't solve in a good way yet, right? I think that this is a very reasonable
[2:33:17.680 --> 2:33:19.680]  you know
[2:33:20.800 --> 2:33:25.400]  Compromise and I think it's interesting and I like that apple tried this
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:28.980]  I like that apple decided it was better to do this imperfections
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:31.680]  Aside rather than not do it at all
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:36.240]  And apparently they've been working on it like it came out late like no one really expected to come on December
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:41.160]  And they've been working on it for a long time and again like people measure. Oh, it's got like the the M. A. H
[2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:46.960]  It milliamps are lower in this than something else, but that's not in context in context
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.760]  It doesn't waste radio which saves a tremendous amount of battery and also an apple because apple is apple
[2:33:52.760 --> 2:33:57.040]  They can integrate it to the point where it knows is connected to a case and not to an outlet
[2:33:57.040 --> 2:34:02.880]  So it doesn't turn on all the background processes to start downloading and doing all the networking that it would in another battery
[2:34:02.880 --> 2:34:04.320]  Case which saves even more power
[2:34:04.320 --> 2:34:10.680]  So they sort of optimized for efficiency and not for raw volume of battery. Yeah, and I kind of feel like I thought I
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:14.320]  When I read reviews of it that a lot of them mentioned and to me
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:18.520]  This is just it's the wrong way of doing it is you have to understand what it's supposed to be used for it
[2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:24.080]  But the test that a lot of people tried to use was all right take off iPhone that took completely down to zero and
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:29.960]  Plug it in and how far do you get and you don't even you know the complaint was it doesn't even get you back a full chart
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:35.480]  Doesn't get you back to a hundred percent like 80% that's not the use case of it though the use case of it is not
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:39.040]  How far does it get you from a completely dead phone? It's
[2:34:39.760 --> 2:34:47.040]  What is your battery life if you you know if you have it what is your battery life like if you keep it in it from the start of the day and
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:52.440]  The answer is it easily gets you through the whole day of very heavy use
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:54.920]  That's why I have a switch on it too, right?
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:35:01.200]  That's not something a human should be managing that's something the software should be managing right where as the thing
[2:35:01.200 --> 2:35:07.800]  And I can mention this thing I personally prefer than a battery charging case is a little pocket sized external battery
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:14.320]  That's the sort of thing though where you do want to know how much you know where the mega amps or whatever amps the M8
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:16.760]  M8's WR where they
[2:35:17.280 --> 2:35:23.480]  Were that really matters where let's say if I take one with me and where my families at Disney World all day
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:28.640]  Where maybe I'll charge my phone up a little bit and then give it to my wife and let her charge her her phone up a little bit
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:32.120]  And maybe plug in your iPad at for some time in theory
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:37.360]  Yeah for or for one that the ones it would charge an iPad or I would call them bigger than pocket size
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:42.760]  But if you're carrying a bag around it's easily, you know, it's just I can certainly see why a lot of people do put them in their bag
[2:35:44.520 --> 2:35:49.960]  That's where that matters for something that's supposed to get you all day battery life even with heavy use
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:54.160]  The amount of you know energy that's in the Apple one is more than enough
[2:35:54.520 --> 2:35:58.680]  The the larger piece that I've seen and I think you've used I know you've seen this
[2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:05.240]  There's a bunch of people who've had like it was sort of like this is the year Apple design went to shit and their arguments are
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:07.600]  more or less
[2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:11.160]  The battery case is ugly the Apple TV remote is
[2:36:12.280 --> 2:36:13.360]  Symmetric
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:17.040]  So that it's hard to tell which way it's pointed. Yeah, they're kind of like ignorant piece
[2:36:17.040 --> 2:36:24.360]  The Apple pencil charges is like a like a big skinny whang hanging out of your iPad pro and
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:28.800]  The MacBook doesn't have enough USB ports and
[2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:33.360]  They lump them all together and they're like there you go apples going to shit
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:41.520]  And I would say that there is some merit to some of these complaints and there is no merit to some of these complaints and
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:46.160]  Some of them are not really an end they want to lump it all together and say that
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:51.240]  Apple is losing it's way without Steve Jobs and Johnny I've is you know, I don't know
[2:36:52.520 --> 2:36:57.000]  You know not paying attention or something like often an arboretum somewhere in Belgium. You're right
[2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:00.760]  And I don't think I think there's some merit to some of the complaints
[2:37:00.760 --> 2:37:03.160]  But I don't think that any of them are
[2:37:04.080 --> 2:37:07.640]  Worry some with the possible existence exception of Apple music
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:10.200]  I think the a lot of them are incredibly lazy
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:16.120]  Just that they they didn't try to understand why the design was done the way it was before they criticized it some of the points are absolutely valid
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:18.120]  But Apple has always had
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:20.120]  Design that you could criticize every year
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:23.640]  You know priestive jobs after the second coming is Steve Jobs
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:28.440]  During Tim Cook's reign. There's all there's always been design elements that that weren't great
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:30.440]  I mean mobile me again famously
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:33.360]  Under Steve Jobs the thing that's interesting to me is like again
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:39.480]  Do people take the time to understand it? There was criticism that the iPad pro had this empty space for the speakers
[2:37:39.480 --> 2:37:41.040]  And they should have been filled with battery
[2:37:41.040 --> 2:37:46.560]  But then you sort of think how heavy would that make the iPad pro and what's and you are legally not allowed to ship batteries
[2:37:46.560 --> 2:37:52.200]  Like lithium ion batteries of a certain size would be great to have an iPad pro that you cannot ship to a customer
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:57.920]  And I always say or there was an article about how Apple was posting a job listing for someone to use avid and
[2:37:58.760 --> 2:38:02.400]  and Adobe Premiere and it and there was a whole article
[2:38:02.400 --> 2:38:04.320]  How even Apple doesn't want to use final cut anymore?
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.680]  And and that was actually for the Beats office in Culver City outside Los Angeles
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:13.320]  Which is as only ever been using those products and hasn't been integrated into Apple's play
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:18.560]  So there's just like those are like sort of lazy articles in my opinion. Yeah. Well, you could it
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:25.200]  I totally agree with that and I saw that about the the the final cut pro not being listed as a thing for the job
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:29.680]  And it was beat you can argue though that it still is damning against final cut pro X that
[2:38:30.280 --> 2:38:36.320]  Somebody outside Apple wasn't using it because they're there work, you know that they showed you know without it
[2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:40.760]  You know that they should have that if final cut pro X is what it should be that they would have been using it
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:45.280]  That every customer would use it although Apple increasingly is not targeting every customer with their products
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:49.040]  Yeah, I think a discussion of what's gone wrong with final cut pro X is beyond the scope of yes
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:52.560]  Absolutely, but it'd be worth talking about but the Apple music the control
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:57.160]  Yeah, there's absolutely things worth criticizing the one that the one that I find the most frustrating and the one
[2:38:57.160 --> 2:39:00.400]  I think is the most clearly talked about is the Apple pencil
[2:39:00.400 --> 2:39:06.120]  Which is that if you and I swear to God the gizmodo article was more or less
[2:39:07.760 --> 2:39:12.560]  In terms of what's bad about Apple design and all the stuff in 2015
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.800]  They were like Apple pencil enough said and it's just a picture of it charging well
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:21.280]  It sticks off the table and the mouth the charger in the mouth. Oh, yeah, the try it
[2:39:21.280 --> 2:39:25.760]  Yeah, they lump that and so that's a good on the out of charger at the charger in the mouse under bottom
[2:39:25.760 --> 2:39:30.240]  I've that's an interesting that's separate than the pencil
[2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:32.800]  But they they lump them together with the pencil
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:37.200]  If you write for a site that is ostensibly focused on technology at all
[2:39:37.200 --> 2:39:42.800]  as gizmodo supposedly is and the only thing you're going to say about the pencil in your article about its design
[2:39:43.040 --> 2:39:49.680]  Is this is what it looks like when you're charging it from the iPad and not even mention that it is
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:54.880]  I really think without any kind of hyperbole that it's revolutionized stylus input
