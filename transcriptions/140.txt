[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  Did you get anything good for the Christmas?
[00:03.920 --> 00:06.400]  The art of Star Wars The Force Awakens,
[00:06.400 --> 00:08.700]  which Serenity recommended and is really good.
[00:08.700 --> 00:09.720]  What was it? What's that?
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.560]  Is that a coffee table?
[00:10.560 --> 00:11.920]  It's a book that shows all the design process.
[00:11.920 --> 00:13.880]  Yeah, that shows the design process they went through,
[00:13.880 --> 00:15.480]  which I always find fascinating.
[00:16.800 --> 00:18.200]  It seems, how did they make the book?
[00:18.200 --> 00:19.600]  How is the book already out?
[00:20.880 --> 00:22.320]  Well, they showed stuff that they've been working on
[00:22.320 --> 00:24.480]  for years and years, like early concepts for the movies
[00:24.480 --> 00:27.400]  and designs they did and things that changed an awful lot
[00:27.400 --> 00:29.400]  and stuff that Abrams would come back and forth
[00:29.400 --> 00:31.900]  while he was working on Star Trek to kibbutz about.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.600]  Kibbutz? I would say kibbutz.
[00:36.600 --> 00:38.240]  Am I wrong? Am I wrong? I'm wrong.
[00:38.240 --> 00:39.320]  I don't know.
[00:39.320 --> 00:41.400]  I probably got a little bit of Yiddish in mine.
[00:44.280 --> 00:45.480]  So, like, what changed?
[00:46.400 --> 00:47.280]  I don't want to go all Star Wars.
[00:47.280 --> 00:49.880]  I've only just started it because I've gotten so not used
[00:49.880 --> 00:51.440]  to looking at physical media anymore
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.380]  that it's a slow reading process for me,
[00:53.380 --> 00:57.480]  but a lot of the early designs were just very different
[00:57.480 --> 01:00.240]  in just the way they look and some of the character ideas
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.080]  that they had.
[01:02.920 --> 01:04.720]  I always get the feeling that Abrams writes
[01:04.720 --> 01:05.600]  by the seat of his pants,
[01:05.600 --> 01:08.440]  which is not my favorite characteristic of his.
[01:08.440 --> 01:10.960]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely,
[01:10.960 --> 01:14.380]  I keep saying I don't want to go all Star Wars on this.
[01:14.380 --> 01:18.640]  I do think, I mean, that's his reputation.
[01:18.640 --> 01:19.800]  I mean, I don't know him personally,
[01:19.800 --> 01:21.640]  but I mean, it's certainly his reputation.
[01:21.640 --> 01:24.080]  And it's like, as one of my friends put it,
[01:24.080 --> 01:27.640]  that he inevitably heads into every movie,
[01:27.640 --> 01:32.280]  like production starts with the story 85% written,
[01:32.280 --> 01:35.760]  which it's just, that's his style, you know?
[01:35.760 --> 01:38.060]  And I don't know that it's ever going to change.
[01:38.060 --> 01:39.540]  And you get wonderful set pieces
[01:39.540 --> 01:42.000]  and sometimes the story takes a backseat to them.
[01:43.380 --> 01:45.440]  I did like The Force Awakens, though.
[01:45.440 --> 01:48.160]  I don't want to leave people without the, I mean-
[01:48.160 --> 01:49.600]  I've seen it four times.
[01:49.600 --> 01:51.780]  I love the damn thing.
[01:51.780 --> 01:53.600]  Would you have gone and seen it four times anyway?
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.280]  I mean, you really like it that much?
[01:55.280 --> 01:56.120]  I've seen it twice.
[01:56.120 --> 01:57.340]  I can't watch the prequels again.
[01:57.340 --> 01:58.640]  I have an inability to watch.
[01:58.640 --> 01:59.840]  I can watch movies a lot
[01:59.840 --> 02:02.040]  and I can't watch the prequels or Man of Steel.
[02:02.040 --> 02:03.520]  Movies like that, I just can't watch again.
[02:03.520 --> 02:05.800]  So this, to me, it has to be a good Star Wars.
[02:05.800 --> 02:07.960]  We don't watch it repeatedly.
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.200]  Man of Steel, again, I don't understand how that movie,
[02:12.200 --> 02:14.360]  I don't understand how that movie got made.
[02:15.640 --> 02:17.000]  They don't have a Kevin Fahey
[02:17.000 --> 02:19.040]  who just oversees DC's properties
[02:19.040 --> 02:20.360]  and no one gives a shit.
[02:20.360 --> 02:23.120]  Right, it's like you somehow run that up the chain
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.760]  at Warner Brothers,
[02:25.760 --> 02:28.800]  which is like where it ultimately falls, right?
[02:28.800 --> 02:30.160]  Act three, he's going to heat vision
[02:30.160 --> 02:31.480]  a bunch of Kryptonian babies.
[02:31.480 --> 02:32.320]  Okay, go for it.
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.760]  I mean, it's not a terrible movie, but it's not Superman.
[02:39.260 --> 02:40.100]  You know what I mean?
[02:40.100 --> 02:40.920]  Yes.
[02:40.920 --> 02:42.720]  And the whole idea of shooting it
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.860]  with that incredibly weird color palette
[02:46.860 --> 02:49.520]  is so bizarre to me.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.360]  I don't understand how that-
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.880]  And now they have Superman versus Batman,
[02:51.880 --> 02:52.880]  which might be a good movie,
[02:52.880 --> 02:55.200]  but it's as dark and dreary as the Suicide Squad.
[02:55.200 --> 02:57.040]  So I don't know how you have Joker in a world
[02:57.040 --> 02:58.400]  where Superman might as well be the Joker.
[02:58.400 --> 03:00.240]  It's just, it's a very odd juxtaposition.
[03:00.240 --> 03:01.520]  Yeah, I mean, there were definitely
[03:01.520 --> 03:04.840]  some good moments in the movie, but it's, I don't know.
[03:04.840 --> 03:06.980]  Anyway, Force Awakens, I liked it a lot.
[03:06.980 --> 03:08.320]  You know, I have some complaints.
[03:08.320 --> 03:09.380]  I don't love it.
[03:11.360 --> 03:13.840]  But, and again, I don't think that this is,
[03:13.840 --> 03:15.400]  this is no spoiler.
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.200]  Again, you know, you can leave your ears open
[03:18.200 --> 03:19.080]  if you haven't seen it yet,
[03:19.080 --> 03:21.320]  but you should definitely go see it
[03:21.320 --> 03:24.080]  before you listen to the next episode of the talk show.
[03:25.200 --> 03:26.720]  I feel like with this one, I feel like,
[03:26.720 --> 03:29.440]  like with, for example, like with Spectre,
[03:29.440 --> 03:32.220]  I'll be very, very cognizant of spoilers
[03:32.220 --> 03:33.400]  because I don't know that everybody
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.320]  goes to see it right away.
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.320]  I feel like with Star Wars,
[03:35.320 --> 03:36.680]  you're sort of under an obligation
[03:36.680 --> 03:39.680]  where if you haven't seen it by, say,
[03:39.680 --> 03:41.720]  the end of the calendar year,
[03:41.720 --> 03:44.680]  then it's on you if you're talking about spoilers.
[03:44.680 --> 03:45.500]  I will just say-
[03:45.500 --> 03:47.140]  And I should say that this was a Star Wars movie to me
[03:47.140 --> 03:48.020]  and the other ones weren't.
[03:48.020 --> 03:49.920]  So this to me is like the first real Star Wars movie
[03:49.920 --> 03:51.400]  you've had in almost 40 years.
[03:51.400 --> 03:52.840]  Yeah, definitely.
[03:52.840 --> 03:53.680]  It felt like it.
[03:53.680 --> 03:55.000]  Well, I don't know.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.720]  I'm not a prequel hater, but I did.
[03:58.720 --> 04:01.080]  The only one I rewatched coming up to this was,
[04:01.080 --> 04:02.680]  because I watched them all a lot with my son
[04:02.680 --> 04:03.680]  when he was younger.
[04:04.720 --> 04:07.000]  So I've seen the prequels a ton of times
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.500]  just because he liked all of the Star Wars movies.
[04:10.520 --> 04:13.280]  And I didn't hate any of them, even The Phantom Menace.
[04:13.280 --> 04:14.480]  I didn't hate, I mean,
[04:14.480 --> 04:16.400]  I obviously had a lot of complaints with it,
[04:16.400 --> 04:20.360]  but I didn't hate it and there were redeemable moments
[04:20.360 --> 04:23.080]  in all of them, or enjoyable moments in all of them.
[04:24.280 --> 04:26.360]  But the one that I definitely thought I liked the best
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.840]  was Revenge of the Sith.
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.560]  And so I rewatched that one before watching
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.680]  the de-specialized editions of the original trilogy
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.900]  before seeing this.
[04:36.900 --> 04:39.560]  And even that one was even,
[04:39.560 --> 04:42.280]  it gets worse as time goes on.
[04:42.280 --> 04:43.120]  Like I hadn't seen it-
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.240]  My pet theory is that the prequels
[04:45.240 --> 04:47.800]  and the special edition are George Lucas' punishment to us
[04:47.800 --> 04:49.560]  for liking Star Wars more than him.
[04:52.280 --> 04:55.500]  I'm so baffled that those movies came.
[04:55.500 --> 04:56.640]  That's one of the things.
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.200]  And I know I've said this before, but it's like,
[05:02.160 --> 05:06.880]  I feel like the prequels, as they are,
[05:06.880 --> 05:09.840]  without changing one thing about them,
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.680]  make sense in a universe where George Lucas
[05:14.680 --> 05:18.280]  didn't control Star Wars or had sold control of Star Wars
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.120]  in the early 90s.
[05:19.120 --> 05:20.320]  Took guys at DC Comics.
[05:20.320 --> 05:22.560]  And yeah, and something like that happened,
[05:22.560 --> 05:25.200]  like Warner Brothers and DC Comics,
[05:25.200 --> 05:29.600]  or some idiots at Fox did this.
[05:29.600 --> 05:32.600]  And it's like, oh, what a crying shame,
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.000]  what they've done.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.600]  It's baffling that he had complete authorial control
[05:38.600 --> 05:41.800]  over the whole thing and that the guy who came up with,
[05:41.800 --> 05:44.840]  and deservedly so, gets all the credit in the world
[05:44.840 --> 05:46.160]  for the original trilogy,
[05:47.760 --> 05:52.320]  that it was him who did this and that there's no indication
[05:52.320 --> 05:54.560]  that he was ever, you know,
[05:54.560 --> 05:57.400]  suffered any kind of severe head injury or-
[05:57.400 --> 06:00.880]  He wanted to do his experimental films.
[06:00.880 --> 06:02.840]  And I think he kind of thinks we didn't let him,
[06:02.840 --> 06:03.680]  that because of Star Wars,
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.520]  he wasn't allowed to make the experimental films
[06:05.520 --> 06:06.760]  he really wanted to make.
[06:08.140 --> 06:08.980]  That's the thing.
[06:08.980 --> 06:09.800]  I don't know if people know this,
[06:09.800 --> 06:12.280]  but it's like, that's really who George Lucas was.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.640]  And if you look at like THX 1138,
[06:14.640 --> 06:17.760]  or even like the student version of it before it,
[06:17.760 --> 06:19.480]  they were really, really, I mean,
[06:19.480 --> 06:22.500]  they're true art films in the 60s and 70s since.
[06:25.320 --> 06:28.880]  But that's not, I don't know.
[06:29.880 --> 06:31.840]  I feel like he really likes the prequels.
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.680]  I really do.
[06:32.680 --> 06:33.680]  When you listen to him talk,
[06:33.680 --> 06:35.960]  I don't think that he was spiteful.
[06:35.960 --> 06:37.280]  I feel like that's what he,
[06:37.280 --> 06:39.640]  somehow that's what he decided he wanted to make.
[06:39.640 --> 06:40.800]  But anyway, it doesn't hold up well.
[06:40.800 --> 06:44.680]  And I also would say most incredibly to me
[06:44.680 --> 06:46.760]  is that the effects really don't hold up.
[06:48.160 --> 06:49.220]  Especially in the,
[06:50.320 --> 06:51.960]  well, I didn't watch the other two recently,
[06:51.960 --> 06:55.000]  but when I rewatched the Blu-ray version
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  of Revenge of the Sith,
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.960]  I was really kind of startled
[06:59.960 --> 07:01.960]  because it had been several years since I'd seen it.
[07:01.960 --> 07:04.040]  And I was really startled at how poorly
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.160]  I thought the effects held up overall.
[07:06.160 --> 07:06.980]  But then when you watch,
[07:06.980 --> 07:07.820]  because I did the same thing as you,
[07:07.820 --> 07:09.640]  I watched the de-specialized editions right before
[07:09.640 --> 07:10.800]  going to see The Force Awakens,
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.440]  and those effects hold up great.
[07:12.440 --> 07:13.280]  Yeah.
[07:13.280 --> 07:14.100]  I mean, you can definitely,
[07:14.100 --> 07:15.240]  even the ones that you know,
[07:15.240 --> 07:17.000]  you can kind of see that it's not real.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.280]  Maybe the stop motion on a walker or something
[07:21.280 --> 07:25.940]  isn't quite right.
[07:25.940 --> 07:28.500]  But the way that it fails,
[07:28.500 --> 07:31.000]  it doesn't get worse as time goes on.
[07:31.000 --> 07:31.840]  Absolutely.
[07:31.840 --> 07:35.080]  It fails in a way that it failed right when they came out,
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.800]  or gets to like the 98, 99% marker.
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.520]  And there's a certain charm to it.
[07:41.680 --> 07:42.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:43.980 --> 07:45.660]  I think the biggest thing that really strikes me
[07:45.660 --> 07:49.040]  about the prequel trilogy effects-wise
[07:49.040 --> 07:54.040]  is the uncanny valley of the fact
[07:57.600 --> 08:00.600]  that almost everything was shot against a green screen.
[08:00.600 --> 08:01.440]  And I can't-
[08:01.440 --> 08:02.800]  Almost a cartoon.
[08:02.800 --> 08:05.200]  You can pause any scene,
[08:05.200 --> 08:07.360]  and just like the most mundane things,
[08:07.360 --> 08:12.360]  like a meeting in Palpatine's office.
[08:13.880 --> 08:16.560]  It's like they're just having a meeting in an office.
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.880]  And I mean, we could go on and on and on about this
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.440]  and talk about how the fact that,
[08:20.440 --> 08:22.560]  how so many of the scenes were meetings
[08:22.560 --> 08:25.200]  in Palpatine's office is a problem, the whole thing.
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.720]  Two shots just sitting on sofas.
[08:26.720 --> 08:30.520]  But it just, and you can freeze frame,
[08:30.520 --> 08:33.120]  pause the thing, and I can't look at it
[08:33.120 --> 08:36.520]  and articulate logically what it is
[08:36.520 --> 08:38.520]  that looks phony to me about it.
[08:38.520 --> 08:41.040]  I can't, I don't know what it is,
[08:41.040 --> 08:42.160]  but there's something.
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.920]  There is something to the whole thing
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.840]  where it just looks like an inverse version of Roger Rabbit.
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.280]  You've got all these real people in a cartoon world.
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.800]  Yeah, it reminds me of something,
[08:54.800 --> 08:56.640]  you and Merlin did a talk a long time ago,
[08:56.640 --> 08:58.440]  South by Southwest, that I always loved.
[08:58.440 --> 09:01.080]  And it reminds me of what went wrong with George Lucas
[09:01.080 --> 09:03.440]  is that he lost his inner editor
[09:03.440 --> 09:05.880]  and he lost his external editor too.
[09:05.880 --> 09:08.160]  There was no one to tell him yes and no,
[09:08.160 --> 09:10.360]  no one that had the authority to do that at least.
[09:10.360 --> 09:11.840]  He was just surrounded by enablers.
[09:11.840 --> 09:14.280]  And you can never do great work when people around you
[09:14.280 --> 09:16.320]  are just saying, yeah, that's great all the time.
[09:16.320 --> 09:18.920]  Yeah, did we mention Lucas in particular at that talk?
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.080]  No, it was just about the craft of writing.
[09:22.080 --> 09:23.640]  Yeah, but it's definitely true.
[09:23.640 --> 09:25.920]  I'll put a link in the show notes to that.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.000]  It's probably the high water mark
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.840]  of my public speaking career.
[09:29.840 --> 09:30.760]  It was an awesome talk.
[09:34.880 --> 09:36.480]  I think I've said this before too.
[09:36.480 --> 09:38.400]  Merlin and I had this talk planned.
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.480]  And we had met the day before in his hotel room down in Austin.
[09:42.480 --> 09:43.920]  And we had a whole talk planned.
[09:43.920 --> 09:46.160]  And then we were going on in the afternoon the next day.
[09:46.160 --> 09:48.680]  And in the morning, we met again to go over it.
[09:48.680 --> 09:51.720]  And we decided that it was total rubbish
[09:51.720 --> 09:55.640]  and that it was a terrible idea.
[09:55.640 --> 09:57.960]  And so we ripped it up.
[09:57.960 --> 10:00.080]  And we decided to do a different talk.
[10:00.080 --> 10:03.440]  And at this point, we were 90 minutes away
[10:03.440 --> 10:06.320]  from going on stage.
[10:06.320 --> 10:08.120]  Well, not when we decided to do that,
[10:08.120 --> 10:10.480]  but when we had completed a draft of it.
[10:10.480 --> 10:12.200]  And we were like, well, let's run through it once.
[10:12.200 --> 10:13.400]  And we ran through it once.
[10:13.400 --> 10:15.160]  And it took 45 minutes, 50 minutes.
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.200]  And we were like, oh my god, that was awful.
[10:17.200 --> 10:18.040]  That was even worse.
[10:18.040 --> 10:18.920]  And we were like, what do we do?
[10:18.920 --> 10:21.120]  Do we go back to the one we threw away?
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.840]  Or do we try to make do with this?
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.720]  And we were like, oh shit, we don't even know.
[10:24.720 --> 10:25.720]  We don't have a chance.
[10:25.720 --> 10:27.680]  We only had 30 minutes before we went on stage.
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.200]  And we were like, this is going to be terrible.
[10:29.200 --> 10:30.400]  And then we were like, well, to hell with it.
[10:30.400 --> 10:32.480]  It's just a panel at South by Southwest.
[10:32.480 --> 10:34.800]  And so we went with the plan, the new one.
[10:34.800 --> 10:37.040]  And the second time we did it in front of the audience,
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.480]  as soon as we finished, we looked at each other.
[10:38.480 --> 10:39.920]  We were like, wow, that was great.
[10:39.920 --> 10:45.200]  And ever since, I think more than any other public speaking
[10:45.200 --> 10:47.920]  thing I've ever done in my life, people come up to me still now
[10:47.920 --> 10:51.080]  and say, that was pretty good.
[10:51.080 --> 10:52.200]  It was an outstanding talk.
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.640]  People should go listen to it if they haven't already.
[10:55.640 --> 10:57.640]  I'm not sure what the advice is, though.
[10:57.640 --> 10:59.240]  I feel like I'm giving people the advice
[10:59.240 --> 11:03.840]  that if you ever do a run through of a talk and it's terrible, stop.
[11:03.840 --> 11:04.920]  Speak from the heart, John.
[11:04.920 --> 11:05.720]  You're all set.
[11:05.720 --> 11:06.480]  You're ready to go.
[11:06.480 --> 11:08.320]  Go on stage.
[11:08.320 --> 11:08.920]  Let me start.
[11:08.920 --> 11:11.080]  Or anyway, the whole reason we're here is we're going to talk.
[11:11.080 --> 11:11.840]  You're in review.
[11:11.840 --> 11:13.720]  Here we are at the end of 2015.
[11:13.720 --> 11:15.400]  You and I did this last year on the show.
[11:15.400 --> 11:17.880]  I thought it was great.
[11:17.880 --> 11:20.720]  This is going to be, we shouldn't have wasted any time on the movie talk
[11:20.720 --> 11:23.280]  because there's a lot to talk about.
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.640]  And you're in review, and mostly focused on Apple.
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.240]  Apple's year in review.
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.000]  Before we get started on that, why don't I take our first break and thank
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.920]  one of the great sponsors all year long.
[11:36.920 --> 11:40.360]  They've been with us on the show, our good friends at Harry's.
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.680]  Harry's offers high quality razors and blades and other shaving products
[11:45.680 --> 11:49.880]  for a fraction of the price of the big razor brands.
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.880]  It was started by just two guys, and they just
[11:51.880 --> 11:54.440]  wanted a better product without paying an arm and a leg.
[11:54.440 --> 11:58.560]  Didn't make any sense to them that regular razor
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.600]  blades you buy in the drugstore, the good ones, cost as much as they did.
[12:02.600 --> 12:05.840]  So they started to make their own blades.
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.240]  They procured them from an old blade factory
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.480]  that's been operating in Germany for a long time.
[12:10.480 --> 12:11.480]  They raised money.
[12:11.480 --> 12:13.940]  Once they liked the quality so much, they actually bought it.
[12:13.940 --> 12:18.200]  So Harry's owns their own razor factory over in Germany.
[12:18.200 --> 12:23.520]  It's a factory that's been producing high quality blades for decades.
[12:23.520 --> 12:27.560]  That's how they offer high quality at an amazing price,
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.440]  is they own the factory.
[12:29.440 --> 12:31.520]  They sell direct to you.
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.400]  You just go to the website, and there's no middleman involved.
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.360]  And so you get a great product in amazing packaging.
[12:40.360 --> 12:43.400]  Truly, truly great packaging.
[12:43.400 --> 12:45.080]  I could say it before I'll say it again.
[12:45.080 --> 12:48.760]  Packaging that makes you not want to throw it away.
[12:48.760 --> 12:50.120]  And the prices are amazing.
[12:50.120 --> 12:51.160]  Here's their starter set.
[12:51.160 --> 12:57.040]  $15 gets you a razor, moisturizing shave cream or gel, your choice,
[12:57.040 --> 12:58.400]  and three razor blades.
[12:58.400 --> 13:03.020]  And when you need more blades, they are always $2 each or less.
[13:03.020 --> 13:04.720]  An eight pack is just $15.
[13:04.720 --> 13:07.800]  A 16 pack is just $25, et cetera, et cetera.
[13:07.800 --> 13:10.320]  You can sign up for a subscription service,
[13:10.320 --> 13:13.120]  or if you know how frequently you shave and how frequently you replace
[13:13.120 --> 13:15.360]  the blades, they'll just show up automatically,
[13:15.360 --> 13:17.440]  and you don't even have to do any kind of work.
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.160]  So great product, great design, and super, super convenient.
[13:22.160 --> 13:24.740]  You'll never have to worry about buying razor blades again.
[13:24.740 --> 13:26.360]  So here's where you go to find out more.
[13:26.360 --> 13:27.360]  Go to their website.
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.880]  It is harrys, H-A-R-R-Y-S, dot com.
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.080]  And remember this promo code, talk show, just T-A-L-K-S-H-O-W,
[13:37.080 --> 13:41.920]  and you will save $5 off on your first purchase.
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.520]  Talk show.
[13:45.520 --> 13:46.680]  So where do we start?
[13:46.680 --> 13:49.440]  I say we go, what do you say, chronological, right?
[13:49.440 --> 13:50.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[13:50.480 --> 13:54.760]  I think the big thing this year is that for a couple years, since 2012,
[13:54.760 --> 13:56.560]  at least, Apple hadn't had a spring event.
[13:56.560 --> 14:00.340]  So it was almost six months of no news up until WVDC,
[14:00.340 --> 14:02.240]  and this year changed all that again.
[14:02.240 --> 14:05.440]  Yeah, it's like you can't please people, because in those years
[14:05.440 --> 14:14.960]  when they moved the iPad in 2010, 11, and I think even 12,
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.760]  new iPads came out in the early part of the year, spring, late winter,
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.960]  whatever you want to call it.
[14:21.960 --> 14:24.880]  And then when they stopped that, like you said,
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.880]  we more or less started going until WWDC before we heard from them,
[14:29.880 --> 14:32.600]  and people would complain, what the hell are they doing?
[14:32.600 --> 14:33.240]  They've lost it.
[14:33.240 --> 14:35.000]  They don't do anything anymore.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.680]  Apple's not innovating.
[14:38.680 --> 14:42.760]  Now when they do, it's, you know.
[14:42.760 --> 14:43.800]  They've lost focus.
[14:43.800 --> 14:45.160]  Yeah, they've lost focus.
[14:45.160 --> 14:47.400]  That's exactly it.
[14:47.400 --> 14:48.520]  They're done.
[14:48.520 --> 14:50.240]  The two things that were interesting to me at the beginning of the year
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.600]  was, at the very beginning at least, was conjecture over Project Titan,
[14:53.600 --> 14:56.360]  which had just broken at the end of the previous year, and yours
[14:56.360 --> 14:58.920]  and a few other people talking about the price of the gold watch,
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.680]  because we had no idea back then what it was going to be.
[15:01.680 --> 15:03.680]  Yeah, so like a year ago, that's really,
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.360]  you know, we knew that the watch was coming.
[15:05.360 --> 15:07.720]  We knew they were going to have a gold one.
[15:07.720 --> 15:10.800]  Nobody knew what it was going to cost.
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.280]  And Titan, well, it's anything different today than a year ago,
[15:15.280 --> 15:17.800]  regarding, that's the car, for those of you who don't keep out
[15:17.800 --> 15:22.720]  the code names, you know, at the top of your head.
[15:22.720 --> 15:25.160]  I don't know that any, you know, it's,
[15:25.160 --> 15:31.800]  eventually it's going to not be a, you know, secret rumor or project,
[15:31.800 --> 15:34.200]  but I don't know that anything happened this year,
[15:34.200 --> 15:36.120]  compared to last, that makes it seem anymore.
[15:36.120 --> 15:39.560]  Just internal stuff.
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.760]  The gold watch was fascinating to me, because this year more than any other,
[15:42.760 --> 15:45.840]  it felt like Apple started segmenting their product line,
[15:45.840 --> 15:49.200]  and that caused an incredible amount of stress and anxiety for the community,
[15:49.200 --> 15:51.360]  because we were used to really there being few products,
[15:51.360 --> 15:53.560]  almost every one of them was for us,
[15:53.560 --> 15:56.440]  and now there were gold watches and one port MacBooks,
[15:56.440 --> 15:58.600]  and products that might be Apple products,
[15:58.600 --> 16:00.080]  but not ones that we would want,
[16:00.080 --> 16:03.120]  and that was very uncomfortable for a lot of people.
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.040]  I think that we, and to me it was, I don't regret it,
[16:07.040 --> 16:09.840]  because I thought it was fascinating to think about,
[16:09.840 --> 16:12.840]  I had a lot of fun writing about trying to guess
[16:12.840 --> 16:15.160]  what the watch pricing was going to be.
[16:15.160 --> 16:17.840]  In hindsight though, we've spent way more time thinking,
[16:17.840 --> 16:21.280]  we collectively spent way more time thinking and speculating
[16:21.280 --> 16:25.400]  on what the gold Apple Watch editions mean for Apple
[16:25.400 --> 16:27.360]  and this watch as a product,
[16:27.360 --> 16:30.840]  before they came out, than afterwards.
[16:30.840 --> 16:34.080]  Once they came out, it's like the gold one,
[16:34.080 --> 16:36.680]  the difference between our universe,
[16:36.680 --> 16:38.760]  where the Apple Watch edition exists,
[16:38.760 --> 16:40.000]  and the alternate universe,
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.960]  where the gold one doesn't even exist,
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.320]  there's almost no differences between those two hypotheticals.
[16:47.320 --> 16:48.560]  They had a nice spike in sales
[16:48.560 --> 16:51.840]  when Apple Store Dubai opened, and that's about it.
[16:51.840 --> 16:53.520]  Oh, I have no doubt, I have seen them,
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.640]  I saw one, I forget when, it must have been August,
[16:59.640 --> 17:01.760]  when I was in Vegas for a few days in August,
[17:01.760 --> 17:05.480]  and I saw one on somebody's wrist there.
[17:05.480 --> 17:06.800]  And I know I've heard from readers
[17:06.800 --> 17:08.440]  who've seen them here and there,
[17:08.440 --> 17:10.520]  but they're definitely rare enough that it's like,
[17:10.520 --> 17:12.800]  when people do see somebody wearing one,
[17:12.800 --> 17:15.320]  that they think like, hey, I'll email Gruber
[17:15.320 --> 17:16.680]  and tell him I saw somebody wearing one.
[17:16.680 --> 17:19.600]  It's pretty, for obvious reasons, it's pretty rare,
[17:19.600 --> 17:23.040]  because they're really, really quite expensive.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.280]  Yeah, for me, it was more the sign,
[17:24.280 --> 17:26.200]  because as Apple gets complaints all the time
[17:26.200 --> 17:27.200]  that they never do anything different,
[17:27.200 --> 17:28.560]  they don't take risks, they don't experiment,
[17:28.560 --> 17:30.120]  they should buy this company, they should try,
[17:30.120 --> 17:32.720]  and these are products that do take those kinds of risks,
[17:32.720 --> 17:36.040]  whether the gold Apple Watch in the long lens of history
[17:36.040 --> 17:37.600]  is good or not, at least they were willing
[17:37.600 --> 17:41.080]  to try something different, and I like when Apple does that.
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.040]  I would say this with the Watch, in hindsight,
[17:43.040 --> 17:47.040]  and as the year petered out, or played out,
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.040]  I guess I should say, I feel very strongly
[17:52.040 --> 17:57.040]  that the best Apple Watch is the Sport edition,
[17:57.720 --> 17:59.560]  and I don't even mean it in the sense
[17:59.560 --> 18:02.720]  that you're getting the more bang for your buck,
[18:02.720 --> 18:05.840]  the way that sometimes when people do reviews
[18:05.840 --> 18:10.160]  of a category of product, and they say,
[18:10.160 --> 18:12.800]  here's our pick for the best, it's not necessarily
[18:12.800 --> 18:16.960]  that they mean it's the best, it's the best given the price.
[18:16.960 --> 18:19.760]  Like the best car might be the Honda Accord,
[18:19.760 --> 18:21.680]  somebody would say, but they're not trying to say
[18:21.680 --> 18:23.200]  that it's literally a better car
[18:23.200 --> 18:28.200]  than a $110,000 top-of-the-line Mercedes S-Class.
[18:29.200 --> 18:32.160]  They're saying that given, I'm saying flat out
[18:32.160 --> 18:33.840]  that I think the Apple Watch Sport edition
[18:33.840 --> 18:36.400]  is the best version of the Watch, period.
[18:38.560 --> 18:40.560]  Full stop, don't worry about the fact
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.840]  that it costs less than the other ones.
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.280]  Yeah, I mean, it's got a wide variety of looks.
[18:44.280 --> 18:46.680]  It's got the silver, the black, the rose gold, the gold.
[18:46.680 --> 18:48.760]  It's super light, it's got probably the best
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.360]  taptic engine of any of the watches, a lot to recommend it.
[18:52.360 --> 18:55.120]  It's the taptic engine that to me makes me say that
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.680]  because on mine, the one that I personally own
[18:59.680 --> 19:01.160]  is the black stainless steel one.
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.200]  The taptic engine was never that great to start with.
[19:05.200 --> 19:07.760]  Wasn't broken, I wouldn't call it broken.
[19:07.760 --> 19:09.800]  It just didn't feel great.
[19:09.800 --> 19:12.280]  And it certainly didn't feel like the demo ones
[19:12.280 --> 19:15.520]  that Apple had, which were like the platonic ideal
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.440]  of what this was supposed to feel like.
[19:17.440 --> 19:19.480]  And quite frankly, just didn't feel as good to me
[19:19.480 --> 19:21.880]  as the sport one that I have.
[19:21.880 --> 19:23.600]  I've got a review unit sport watch here.
[19:23.600 --> 19:25.280]  My son has a sport edition.
[19:26.520 --> 19:28.240]  The taptic engine just doesn't feel as good.
[19:28.240 --> 19:30.880]  And the other factor is that as the years gone on,
[19:30.880 --> 19:33.800]  the taptic engine in my black stainless one
[19:33.800 --> 19:35.280]  has gotten worse.
[19:35.280 --> 19:37.840]  It's just somehow, it's not weaker,
[19:37.840 --> 19:40.120]  but it's like looser somehow.
[19:40.120 --> 19:41.480]  It's very hard to describe.
[19:42.800 --> 19:45.040]  I just feel very strongly that the sport one
[19:45.040 --> 19:46.680]  is a superior product.
[19:46.680 --> 19:48.600]  Yeah, my black stainless steel is the same.
[19:48.600 --> 19:50.440]  I think we got ours at the same time.
[19:53.760 --> 19:54.600]  Yeah, I got mine right away.
[19:54.600 --> 19:56.720]  The black stainless steel that I have is the same.
[19:56.720 --> 19:58.880]  And I don't know if that's because it's early on
[19:58.880 --> 20:01.920]  and there were some rumors that they shipped later
[20:01.920 --> 20:02.960]  because there was trouble
[20:02.960 --> 20:04.720]  with one of the taptic engine suppliers
[20:04.720 --> 20:06.560]  and they had to ditch a bunch of the engines
[20:06.560 --> 20:09.760]  and that's pushed a lot of the delivery dates out.
[20:09.760 --> 20:11.520]  But the stainless steel watch I got
[20:11.520 --> 20:12.880]  with the Hermes strap later on
[20:12.880 --> 20:14.160]  has a much better taptic engine.
[20:14.160 --> 20:15.920]  So hopefully they figured that part out.
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.360]  Yeah, so that's interesting to me.
[20:17.360 --> 20:21.840]  So you got, my sport, or not my sport,
[20:21.840 --> 20:24.360]  my personal Apple Watch is one that I ordered
[20:24.360 --> 20:25.720]  on the first day you could order,
[20:25.720 --> 20:27.680]  which was I think April 10th.
[20:27.680 --> 20:30.880]  And I got it at some point in mid-May.
[20:33.120 --> 20:34.240]  That's interesting that you,
[20:34.240 --> 20:36.920]  so you got the Hermes one,
[20:36.920 --> 20:41.480]  which is a stainless steel Apple Watch.
[20:41.480 --> 20:44.160]  Even after all this time, I still get,
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.520]  I still want to call it Apple Watch steel
[20:46.520 --> 20:48.800]  just when talking about it, just to be clear,
[20:48.800 --> 20:51.360]  as opposed to Apple Watch as a generic platform,
[20:51.360 --> 20:54.760]  which is, anyway, that's, well,
[20:54.760 --> 20:56.360]  maybe this year they'll fix it.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.600]  But it's interesting to me that you feel like
[20:59.600 --> 21:02.680]  you got a better taptic engine in that one.
[21:02.680 --> 21:04.400]  Yeah, and it shipped with watchOS 2 on it,
[21:04.400 --> 21:06.160]  so I'm guessing that it was later in the production.
[21:06.160 --> 21:09.720]  It wasn't just an original one that I had to update
[21:09.720 --> 21:11.120]  when I got it out of the box.
[21:11.120 --> 21:11.960]  Hmm.
[21:12.920 --> 21:16.920]  So that's, to me, is one, and interesting to me,
[21:16.920 --> 21:19.800]  that's just, the only thing I don't like
[21:19.800 --> 21:21.800]  about the sport one is the,
[21:22.680 --> 21:27.680]  I do wish that it had the sapphire crystal
[21:28.560 --> 21:30.640]  instead of the glass.
[21:30.640 --> 21:33.400]  Totally understand why it doesn't, because of the price.
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.880]  But just in terms of giving it a wholehearted endorsement
[21:38.880 --> 21:41.440]  as if you were gonna buy an Apple Watch today,
[21:41.440 --> 21:42.600]  which one would I recommend?
[21:42.600 --> 21:43.560]  The only thing that would keep me
[21:43.560 --> 21:47.360]  from wholeheartedly recommending the sport ones
[21:47.360 --> 21:50.200]  is the fact that it doesn't have the sapphire display.
[21:51.440 --> 21:54.440]  But even my sons, which he has worn very regularly
[21:54.440 --> 21:56.960]  throughout the year, it definitely has scratches,
[21:56.960 --> 21:58.440]  but they're very, very fine,
[21:58.440 --> 22:01.160]  and they are definitely not visible
[22:01.160 --> 22:02.480]  unless you're looking for them,
[22:02.480 --> 22:04.080]  like holding it up to the light.
[22:05.160 --> 22:06.680]  And he's just an 11-year-old kid.
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.760]  He's pretty careful with his stuff, but I mean,
[22:08.760 --> 22:11.920]  it's not like he hasn't exposed it
[22:11.920 --> 22:14.560]  to a lot of wear and tear.
[22:14.560 --> 22:15.840]  We've spoken about this before,
[22:15.840 --> 22:18.840]  and it feels like the production quality
[22:18.840 --> 22:21.480]  on the Apple Watches is as good, if not better,
[22:21.480 --> 22:23.000]  than any product Apple's released.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.320]  Like the diamond-like coating
[22:24.320 --> 22:25.440]  on the back stainless steel one,
[22:25.440 --> 22:27.400]  I've thought I've scratched it several times,
[22:27.400 --> 22:29.200]  and it's turned out that it's taken some steel
[22:29.200 --> 22:30.960]  or some concrete off of something else,
[22:30.960 --> 22:32.920]  and the watch itself underneath is fine.
[22:32.920 --> 22:34.280]  Yeah, that's true for mine as well.
[22:34.280 --> 22:37.040]  I will say that with the DLC coating on mine.
[22:37.040 --> 22:39.560]  And I sent you pictures a few weeks ago of mine.
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.480]  It literally looks mint condition.
[22:42.480 --> 22:45.920]  I really feel like, in terms of scratches,
[22:45.920 --> 22:49.280]  I could, if I cleaned it with just warm water
[22:49.280 --> 22:52.400]  and maybe a toothbrush or whatever they say to use,
[22:52.400 --> 22:55.360]  but just to clean it to get some little bits of sand
[22:55.360 --> 22:57.760]  and stuff like that or dust out of there.
[22:57.760 --> 22:59.960]  In terms of scratches, I think I could pass it off
[22:59.960 --> 23:02.120]  as mint, like new in box.
[23:02.120 --> 23:04.080]  It is that unbelievable.
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.880]  And that's not true for any kind
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.520]  of normal stainless steel watch.
[23:07.520 --> 23:10.200]  Yes, it's remarkable.
[23:10.200 --> 23:15.200]  So what about the launch of Apple Watch in hindsight?
[23:15.600 --> 23:19.000]  Got a lot of, I would say, controversy.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.080]  I would say that there was controversy about it,
[23:21.080 --> 23:26.080]  just in terms of the fact that it wasn't in stores.
[23:26.760 --> 23:30.120]  You had to make appointments to try it on in stores.
[23:30.120 --> 23:32.960]  Even people who order right on day one had,
[23:32.960 --> 23:36.400]  some people didn't get their watches till the end of May.
[23:36.400 --> 23:39.440]  There were certain bands that didn't even ship until summer.
[23:41.720 --> 23:43.560]  Lots of people complained about that.
[23:43.560 --> 23:48.000]  But is that just the nature of a brand new product
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.400]  that the first time they ever made a watch,
[23:50.400 --> 23:52.440]  of course the rollout's gonna be like that.
[23:54.360 --> 23:55.620]  Yeah, I think we've seen that previously
[23:55.620 --> 23:57.120]  with some things like the retina displays
[23:57.120 --> 23:58.760]  and the early iPhones.
[23:58.760 --> 24:00.660]  It created production shortages.
[24:00.660 --> 24:02.560]  And the thing with Apple is that they sprint
[24:02.560 --> 24:03.560]  at those deadlines.
[24:03.560 --> 24:05.840]  It's not like they have the products ready way in advance
[24:05.840 --> 24:07.080]  and they just accumulate them for months.
[24:07.080 --> 24:09.240]  They ship them as fast as possible.
[24:09.240 --> 24:10.760]  And sometimes when you do that,
[24:10.760 --> 24:12.800]  you overshoot like something doesn't work out.
[24:12.800 --> 24:14.440]  And I have the feeling that whether it was some
[24:14.440 --> 24:15.640]  of the leathers for some of the straps
[24:15.640 --> 24:17.540]  that they had to swap out or some of the taptic engines
[24:17.540 --> 24:19.680]  that didn't have the yield rates that they needed,
[24:19.680 --> 24:21.800]  they just didn't have enough of them on hand.
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.400]  And that coupled with the fact that it was a new product,
[24:25.400 --> 24:27.080]  it ended up being a goofy launch.
[24:27.080 --> 24:29.480]  And it felt like everything that they did was sort of
[24:29.480 --> 24:32.100]  an attempt to mitigate the problems
[24:32.100 --> 24:33.440]  with getting that product on the market
[24:33.440 --> 24:34.960]  as best that they could.
[24:34.960 --> 24:38.520]  In hindsight though, like now after Christmas
[24:38.520 --> 24:42.080]  and obviously everything I saw,
[24:42.080 --> 24:43.800]  it was that there were no supply problems
[24:43.800 --> 24:46.480]  with any of the watches for the holidays.
[24:46.480 --> 24:49.040]  And just talking, our friend, Craig Hockenberry
[24:49.040 --> 24:50.760]  just posted a thing about it.
[24:50.760 --> 24:55.560]  The downloads of his little free clicker app for the watch
[24:55.560 --> 25:00.140]  that spiked, huge, huge spike on Christmas day.
[25:00.140 --> 25:02.780]  So at least some anecdotal evidence that
[25:02.780 --> 25:06.320]  a significant number of people got Apple watches
[25:06.320 --> 25:09.600]  for Christmas, which was obviously the plan.
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.680]  That's not shocking or surprising news.
[25:12.760 --> 25:15.840]  But in hindsight, the fact that the April, May,
[25:15.840 --> 25:19.160]  June timeframe was a rocky launch
[25:19.160 --> 25:21.840]  in terms of having everything available when it was,
[25:21.840 --> 25:22.660]  yeah, so what?
[25:23.640 --> 25:26.640]  Yeah, I don't wanna say it's concerning
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.300]  because it's repeated, but we've seen that again
[25:28.300 --> 25:29.640]  with things like the Apple Pencil,
[25:29.640 --> 25:33.280]  which hasn't been available to launch with the iPad Pro.
[25:33.280 --> 25:34.960]  They're getting a few in every now and then.
[25:34.960 --> 25:36.600]  And again, brand new product,
[25:36.600 --> 25:39.080]  and it's incredibly hard to coordinate the manufacturing
[25:39.080 --> 25:41.520]  for all these brand new products all at one time.
[25:41.520 --> 25:42.480]  And if Apple had their druthers,
[25:42.480 --> 25:44.620]  they absolutely would want it all at the same time
[25:44.620 --> 25:46.760]  because they'd sell far more that way.
[25:46.760 --> 25:49.560]  What's the availability on the Pencil right now?
[25:49.560 --> 25:52.520]  Still drips, they get a few in at a time
[25:52.520 --> 25:53.800]  and they sell out quickly.
[25:57.280 --> 25:58.800]  Well, we'll come back to that later,
[25:58.800 --> 25:59.760]  but that's interesting.
[25:59.760 --> 26:02.360]  I didn't know that that was hard to buy.
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.240]  Looks like, ooh, yeah, if you go to apple.com today
[26:07.240 --> 26:10.080]  as we record and try to buy from the website,
[26:10.080 --> 26:12.680]  it is available to ship four to five weeks.
[26:12.680 --> 26:13.520]  Wow.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.920]  Yeah, I kind of feel like that's the nature
[26:16.920 --> 26:18.280]  of some of these new things,
[26:18.280 --> 26:20.680]  especially ones that really are sort of
[26:21.960 --> 26:25.520]  like the watch or the Pencil where it's not even just,
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.520]  well, we used to have these 160-some pixel-per-inch screens
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.200]  and now we've gone to four times the pixels, 330 per inch.
[26:39.720 --> 26:43.480]  This is, everything about it is a new thing, all of it.
[26:43.480 --> 26:44.480]  It's not just the tip
[26:44.480 --> 26:46.620]  or whatever other sensors are in the Pencil,
[26:46.620 --> 26:47.800]  it's the whole thing.
[26:48.800 --> 26:50.260]  Yeah, everything has to be almost perfect
[26:50.260 --> 26:51.680]  to get it all to land at the same time
[26:51.680 --> 26:53.080]  and once in a while it's not perfect
[26:53.080 --> 26:55.460]  and we see that with the watch with the Pencil.
[26:55.460 --> 26:56.340]  Things like that.
[26:56.340 --> 26:59.860]  So what do you think with the watch?
[26:59.860 --> 27:03.180]  What do you think we're gonna see this coming year?
[27:05.000 --> 27:06.960]  If we just look at past activities
[27:06.960 --> 27:08.440]  being the best indicator of future activities,
[27:08.440 --> 27:11.240]  I think the watch ends up getting,
[27:11.240 --> 27:14.520]  almost like what happened with the iPad 2 or the iPhone 3G
[27:14.520 --> 27:16.360]  where they just get better at making it
[27:16.360 --> 27:19.480]  and that manifests itself in it being lighter.
[27:19.480 --> 27:20.800]  I don't know if it necessarily has to be thinner
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.640]  because it's got all those,
[27:21.640 --> 27:23.040]  it's got that sensor stack on it
[27:23.040 --> 27:25.920]  but there'll be a new design because that's what Apple does
[27:25.920 --> 27:28.160]  and my biggest hope because,
[27:28.160 --> 27:29.120]  some people are nervous
[27:29.120 --> 27:30.380]  that they have to change the casing every year.
[27:30.380 --> 27:31.480]  I've got so many straps now,
[27:31.480 --> 27:33.920]  my biggest nightmare is if the straps aren't compatible.
[27:33.920 --> 27:35.720]  So I'm hoping that whatever they do with the watch,
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.280]  we get a strap compatibility
[27:37.280 --> 27:40.080]  for as long as we got 30 pin dock connector compatibility.
[27:40.080 --> 27:42.040]  Yeah, I would hope so.
[27:42.040 --> 27:44.800]  But on the other hand, I don't wanna bet on it though.
[27:44.800 --> 27:48.020]  I feel like that was at least their hope originally.
[27:48.020 --> 27:48.860]  Yes.
[27:49.960 --> 27:52.560]  I feel like they're not going to let that constrain them
[27:52.560 --> 27:54.760]  if it means that they,
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.400]  if they feel like they could come out
[27:56.400 --> 27:58.480]  with something really better,
[27:58.480 --> 28:00.000]  that they would take that bullet
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.920]  in the early years of the product.
[28:03.740 --> 28:04.580]  We'll see.
[28:04.580 --> 28:06.820]  I guess if I had to bet, I'd place a small bet
[28:06.820 --> 28:09.200]  that whatever the Apple Watch 2 looks like,
[28:09.200 --> 28:11.800]  it'll be strap compatible.
[28:11.800 --> 28:12.880]  Yeah, there's some obvious gaps.
[28:12.880 --> 28:15.060]  Like the first iPhone didn't have GPS.
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.680]  The first Apple Watch didn't have discrete GPS.
[28:17.680 --> 28:19.760]  It doesn't have discrete radio technology in it either.
[28:19.760 --> 28:22.320]  Like you can't just go on LTE or Wi-Fi.
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.080]  You can go on Wi-Fi by itself, but it's not full on Wi-Fi.
[28:25.080 --> 28:26.020]  So there's things like that,
[28:26.020 --> 28:29.200]  that once the thermal and the power constraints
[28:29.200 --> 28:31.120]  go down low enough or they optimize well enough
[28:31.120 --> 28:32.660]  that they'll be able to build in.
[28:32.660 --> 28:34.120]  Yeah, I don't know if we're there yet though.
[28:34.120 --> 28:36.460]  I feel like it's not going to be,
[28:37.580 --> 28:42.200]  I feel like we're not set for a radical upgrade on.
[28:42.200 --> 28:43.040]  Well, they're trying.
[28:43.040 --> 28:44.880]  I was at a Starbucks and I had my Apple Watch on
[28:44.880 --> 28:46.740]  and the guy goes, oh wait, I have the Samsung Watch
[28:46.740 --> 28:48.640]  and it's got 3G and he ran into the back
[28:48.640 --> 28:49.480]  and he ran out with it.
[28:49.480 --> 28:52.300]  And it was the size of a small phone on his wrist.
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.680]  And then the other one that had 3G,
[28:53.680 --> 28:56.040]  they didn't end up being able to ship it.
[28:56.040 --> 28:57.020]  I forget which one that was,
[28:57.020 --> 28:58.560]  but it was a recent watch that was going to come out.
[28:58.560 --> 29:00.320]  Oh, it was LG.
[29:00.320 --> 29:02.480]  LGs, yeah, they couldn't ship it
[29:02.480 --> 29:04.800]  because this stuff is really hard.
[29:04.800 --> 29:06.840]  Yeah, I can't imagine that they're going to have
[29:06.840 --> 29:08.180]  independent 3G yet.
[29:09.520 --> 29:10.720]  I don't know.
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.080]  I mean, eventually it's going to happen.
[29:12.080 --> 29:15.000]  I feel like one year out, that's a bit much to ask.
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.740]  What I would really like to see is just for now,
[29:19.200 --> 29:21.040]  I would like to see an Apple Watch 2
[29:21.040 --> 29:23.240]  that remains a satellite of your iPhone
[29:23.240 --> 29:27.080]  and just is way, way, way more robust
[29:27.080 --> 29:31.480]  in terms of having a fast,
[29:31.480 --> 29:34.720]  responsive connection between the phone and the watch.
[29:34.720 --> 29:35.560]  Reliable.
[29:35.560 --> 29:36.760]  Yeah, the S2 computer on a chip
[29:36.760 --> 29:38.800]  is going to be super interesting to see.
[29:38.800 --> 29:41.600]  Yeah, and I feel like that's the area
[29:41.600 --> 29:45.240]  where they are most likely,
[29:45.240 --> 29:48.600]  and again, this is just looking at the last,
[29:48.600 --> 29:53.600]  you know, the eight, seven, eight years of Apple,
[29:54.600 --> 29:57.800]  the post iPhone Apple,
[29:57.800 --> 30:01.420]  the thing that they have most consistently been able to do
[30:01.420 --> 30:03.900]  in terms of year over year improvement,
[30:03.900 --> 30:06.440]  just give them 12 months and see what they come up with
[30:06.440 --> 30:09.840]  is improve those, you know,
[30:09.840 --> 30:14.660]  the CPUs and chipsets inside these devices.
[30:14.660 --> 30:15.720]  Yeah, we can talk about this later,
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.160]  but my biggest story of the year for Apple
[30:19.160 --> 30:22.480]  was Johnny Srouji's hardware platforms team.
[30:22.480 --> 30:23.560]  Just the work that they've done
[30:23.560 --> 30:25.160]  that almost never gets any credit,
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.180]  but from chipsets to storage controllers
[30:28.180 --> 30:29.640]  to things like 3D,
[30:29.640 --> 30:31.560]  they've just been knocking it out the park.
[30:31.560 --> 30:34.200]  Yeah, well, it's not that they don't get credit
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.000]  and it's unrecognized, but for the most part,
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.360]  so much gets written about Apple
[30:39.360 --> 30:41.880]  and it almost all gets written
[30:41.880 --> 30:46.880]  from the external perspective of looking at the final product
[30:47.840 --> 30:50.520]  and, you know, complaining about those things
[30:50.520 --> 30:53.600]  that are exposed and on the outside,
[30:53.600 --> 30:54.920]  as opposed to sort of looking,
[30:54.920 --> 30:58.200]  trying to look at it from the inside out and say,
[30:58.200 --> 30:59.560]  good God, this is remarkable,
[30:59.560 --> 31:03.520]  what, you know, what the graphics performance is like
[31:03.520 --> 31:06.240]  on this iPad Pro, or if you really-
[31:06.240 --> 31:07.560]  If someone had asked you 10 years ago,
[31:07.560 --> 31:09.900]  who would, you know, if someone had come and told you,
[31:09.900 --> 31:12.360]  John, Apple's gonna be the most exciting
[31:12.360 --> 31:14.040]  chip design company in the world,
[31:14.040 --> 31:15.920]  we would have all thought they were crazy.
[31:15.920 --> 31:17.680]  Well, yeah, I think so too.
[31:17.680 --> 31:20.440]  Definitely, just because it wasn't part of their history
[31:20.440 --> 31:21.740]  and now it kind of is,
[31:21.740 --> 31:24.260]  but it's also, it's more silent
[31:24.260 --> 31:28.560]  because they're only customers themselves.
[31:28.560 --> 31:29.400]  Yes.
[31:29.400 --> 31:33.100]  You know, and they're not peddling these chips
[31:33.100 --> 31:35.600]  to other makers to do things with.
[31:35.600 --> 31:36.520]  Which is a huge advantage
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.660]  because they don't have to worry about profit or loss
[31:38.660 --> 31:39.580]  on a chipset level.
[31:39.580 --> 31:40.440]  They don't have to support other,
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.580]  like they don't have to support things
[31:41.580 --> 31:42.880]  like DirectX on their chips
[31:42.880 --> 31:44.800]  and they don't have to put anyone else's architecture
[31:44.800 --> 31:47.040]  and they can cater to exactly what they want to do
[31:47.040 --> 31:49.560]  on a software side, like four, four case,
[31:49.560 --> 31:52.200]  sorry, three, four case streams, you know, handled at once.
[31:52.200 --> 31:53.880]  Right, even, you know,
[31:53.880 --> 31:55.640]  after a couple of years of these devices,
[31:55.640 --> 31:57.640]  even if you look at the,
[31:57.640 --> 32:01.480]  just like the first iPad in 2010.
[32:01.480 --> 32:02.940]  So just go back,
[32:02.940 --> 32:05.800]  well, at this point that would be six years ago, right?
[32:05.800 --> 32:08.360]  Because we got to kind of start thinking about,
[32:08.360 --> 32:11.000]  I was going to say five, just did 2015 minus 2010,
[32:11.000 --> 32:11.840]  but it's-
[32:11.840 --> 32:12.680]  Five and a half, yeah.
[32:12.680 --> 32:14.700]  Well, five and like 10 twelfths.
[32:14.700 --> 32:15.540]  Record, yeah.
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.840]  Just go back to that first iPad.
[32:18.840 --> 32:20.560]  And I remember, you know,
[32:20.560 --> 32:23.760]  being very impressed by how smooth the whole thing was
[32:23.760 --> 32:26.520]  and like just scrolling when I first got my hands on it.
[32:28.120 --> 32:29.440]  But clearly it wasn't, you know,
[32:29.440 --> 32:32.440]  it had a lower resolution or pixels per inch density
[32:32.440 --> 32:33.440]  than the iPhone did.
[32:33.440 --> 32:36.840]  It was only like 133, right?
[32:36.840 --> 32:39.640]  Cause then that went to 266 when they went retina.
[32:39.640 --> 32:43.280]  You could definitely see pixels and it wasn't that fast.
[32:43.280 --> 32:48.280]  And then if you had given me the pixel count of the iPad Pro
[32:48.400 --> 32:50.380]  and said, when do you think they'll be able to make
[32:50.380 --> 32:53.640]  one of these devices, an iOS device with a display
[32:53.640 --> 32:55.920]  with that many pixels and have it, you know,
[32:55.920 --> 32:59.760]  complete 60 frames per second responsiveness,
[32:59.760 --> 33:01.300]  I would have thought, well, it's possible,
[33:01.300 --> 33:04.280]  but I would have thought, you know, maybe like 10 years.
[33:04.280 --> 33:06.840]  And you know, here it was, it was only five years.
[33:06.840 --> 33:08.600]  So that, you know, it was at least double
[33:08.600 --> 33:13.600]  what I would have guessed as a optimistic scenario.
[33:14.800 --> 33:16.640]  There's a funny story about, you know,
[33:16.640 --> 33:18.600]  Steve Jobs wanting sushi at Cafe Max.
[33:18.600 --> 33:20.440]  So he just told him, go get me the best sushi chef
[33:20.440 --> 33:21.280]  in the world.
[33:21.280 --> 33:22.480]  And they went and got him a great sushi chef.
[33:22.480 --> 33:24.800]  And at the same time, he said, you know, I want some,
[33:24.800 --> 33:26.100]  I don't understand these chip set things.
[33:26.100 --> 33:28.160]  I just want, just get me the best chip guy in the world.
[33:28.160 --> 33:30.120]  And they went and got him the best chip guy in the world.
[33:30.120 --> 33:32.460]  And over the time they just kept accumulating really,
[33:32.460 --> 33:33.640]  really good chip people.
[33:33.640 --> 33:35.520]  And I think most of them still aren't publicly well known
[33:35.520 --> 33:36.640]  that those people are working at Apple,
[33:36.640 --> 33:38.240]  but the team they've assembled there
[33:38.240 --> 33:39.960]  is absolutely industry leading.
[33:39.960 --> 33:41.960]  I think we're gonna only see more and more impressive stuff
[33:41.960 --> 33:43.120]  from them as time goes on.
[33:43.120 --> 33:45.680]  Yeah, and I really do feel like
[33:47.840 --> 33:51.840]  that's what Apple Watch needs the most.
[33:51.840 --> 33:54.840]  You know, we can, you can criticize, you know, it's,
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.000]  there's a weird aspect to it in terms of watches
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.360]  being jewelry and watches being, you know,
[34:02.360 --> 34:04.920]  anything that qualifies as jewelry being something
[34:04.920 --> 34:07.200]  that people use to sort of signify
[34:07.200 --> 34:09.080]  their own personal sense of style.
[34:09.080 --> 34:12.720]  And the fact that if you look at traditional watches,
[34:12.720 --> 34:16.600]  it's a product category where it's almost
[34:16.600 --> 34:19.600]  an uncountable number of options.
[34:19.600 --> 34:20.720]  Even if you just said,
[34:20.720 --> 34:22.720]  I'm gonna go to my local shopping mall
[34:22.720 --> 34:24.600]  and I'm gonna buy myself a watch.
[34:24.600 --> 34:27.580]  Just in the stores in that one mall that you go to,
[34:28.880 --> 34:31.240]  the number of watches that you would consider
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.760]  if you looked at all of them is, you know,
[34:32.760 --> 34:34.280]  you'd never, you wouldn't be able to do it in a day.
[34:34.280 --> 34:35.120]  Staggering.
[34:35.120 --> 34:35.960]  Staggering.
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.160]  And that, you know, with serious variety
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.160]  in the looks that you can go through.
[34:44.480 --> 34:47.800]  And then with Apple Watch, the pitch is
[34:47.800 --> 34:49.400]  everybody's gonna get a watch that's
[34:49.400 --> 34:50.600]  more or less looks the same.
[34:50.600 --> 34:51.760]  And yes, there are, you know,
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.360]  there's a difference between the steel and leather
[34:56.360 --> 34:58.280]  and the sport bands.
[34:58.280 --> 35:03.160]  But the watch itself is fundamentally this identical
[35:05.680 --> 35:09.280]  capsule-shaped rectangle.
[35:09.280 --> 35:10.840]  And, you know, there's a reason for that.
[35:10.840 --> 35:12.200]  I don't think that they can't,
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.280]  it's not feasible for them.
[35:13.280 --> 35:14.400]  Even with the number of, you know,
[35:14.400 --> 35:16.720]  just think about the variety of options they have
[35:16.720 --> 35:18.880]  given this limited design.
[35:18.880 --> 35:20.560]  That's a weird thing.
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.160]  And, you know, for people, not to go off on a,
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.640]  you know, down the rabbit hole of round versus rectangular
[35:28.640 --> 35:31.280]  and, you know, which is the way to go for smartwatches.
[35:33.880 --> 35:36.320]  I think they went rectangular for good reason,
[35:36.320 --> 35:39.960]  but just even given that distinction alone,
[35:39.960 --> 35:40.800]  I understand that.
[35:40.800 --> 35:42.880]  Then there's a reason that people could criticize that.
[35:42.880 --> 35:44.560]  But I don't think that that's the sort of thing
[35:44.560 --> 35:47.160]  that they need to look at for Apple Watch too.
[35:47.160 --> 35:51.960]  Like, I feel like the basic look and layout of it is fine.
[35:51.960 --> 35:54.280]  And that's absolutely not what's holding it back
[35:54.280 --> 35:56.440]  from being more useful to more people.
[35:56.440 --> 35:57.720]  It was good enough for Leia and Jedi.
[35:57.720 --> 35:58.920]  It's good enough for me.
[36:00.120 --> 36:01.240]  That was amazing.
[36:01.240 --> 36:02.760]  That was you who tweeted that, right?
[36:02.760 --> 36:03.600]  Yeah.
[36:03.600 --> 36:08.240]  I can't believe I didn't see that screenshot more.
[36:10.200 --> 36:12.520]  I hadn't seen that since Apple Watch came out.
[36:12.520 --> 36:14.440]  So I'll put it in the show notes, I promise.
[36:14.440 --> 36:16.920]  But Renee had posted a tweet,
[36:16.920 --> 36:18.520]  a screenshot from Return of the Jedi
[36:18.520 --> 36:21.920]  where Leia is like risk communicator.
[36:21.920 --> 36:24.440]  Really does look like an Apple Watch.
[36:24.440 --> 36:27.520]  I mean, not like so much that you would suspect
[36:27.520 --> 36:29.120]  that it was Photoshopped onto the screenshot,
[36:29.120 --> 36:30.960]  but it looks pretty similar.
[36:30.960 --> 36:32.400]  Yeah, amazing.
[36:33.760 --> 36:36.520]  So anyway, my hope for 2016's Apple Watch 2,
[36:36.520 --> 36:38.760]  which I'm guessing will probably come out
[36:38.760 --> 36:41.200]  around the same time as last year's.
[36:41.200 --> 36:42.200]  There are rumors already
[36:42.200 --> 36:45.160]  that there's going to be a March event this year again.
[36:45.160 --> 36:48.360]  I would not be surprised if Apple Watch 2 comes out.
[36:48.360 --> 36:53.360]  My guess is Apple Watch 2 will look very much
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.120]  like Apple Watch 1, case compatible,
[36:56.120 --> 36:58.240]  and that all of the improvements will be
[36:59.640 --> 37:02.160]  pretty much from Johnny Cerugi's team, I think.
[37:02.160 --> 37:04.720]  And of course, obviously software,
[37:05.840 --> 37:10.520]  Apple Watch 3 to, Apple Watch OS 3 to.
[37:10.520 --> 37:11.520]  Watch, yeah, watch OS 3.
[37:11.520 --> 37:14.960]  Watch OS 3 to take advantage of them.
[37:14.960 --> 37:17.040]  I agree, and I think that the mistake
[37:17.040 --> 37:18.720]  that we often make in technology is people say,
[37:18.720 --> 37:20.160]  I don't want to buy a new Apple Watch.
[37:20.160 --> 37:21.560]  Again, I just bought one last year,
[37:21.560 --> 37:23.680]  but Apple's never targeted year over year.
[37:23.680 --> 37:25.920]  I mean, they're happy if you want to upgrade year over year,
[37:25.920 --> 37:27.760]  and there's some subscription things they're doing now
[37:27.760 --> 37:29.400]  that is more geared towards that.
[37:29.400 --> 37:31.360]  But traditionally, the second version
[37:31.360 --> 37:32.800]  is not meant for the people who have the first version,
[37:32.800 --> 37:34.280]  but for people who didn't, for whatever reason,
[37:34.280 --> 37:35.400]  buy the first version.
[37:35.400 --> 37:37.520]  And there's a lot of people who don't have Apple Watches,
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.360]  and those are the ones
[37:38.360 --> 37:40.040]  that they're going to gun for with the second.
[37:40.040 --> 37:41.880]  Right, and the criticism from people
[37:41.880 --> 37:44.320]  who bought Apple Watch 1 is inevitable,
[37:44.320 --> 37:46.840]  and it will be vociferous.
[37:46.840 --> 37:48.960]  But if you think about it from Apple's perspective,
[37:48.960 --> 37:52.000]  and sometimes I think when I think about it
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.080]  from Apple's perspective angle
[37:54.080 --> 37:56.080]  on an explanation for why they're doing this,
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.120]  people get angry, but they're still not being logical.
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.720]  Like, what else is Apple to do?
[38:01.720 --> 38:04.640]  Are they, you know, the only two options
[38:04.640 --> 38:05.880]  that they would have had would have been
[38:05.880 --> 38:10.360]  not to release the Watch 1 last year at all,
[38:10.360 --> 38:12.240]  because there's a new one.
[38:12.240 --> 38:15.280]  They knew that the 2 was coming out in 2016.
[38:15.280 --> 38:16.480]  Which is true every year.
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.800]  Yeah, which if you get locked into that type of thinking,
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.920]  they would not release anything.
[38:21.920 --> 38:24.040]  It would turn into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory
[38:24.040 --> 38:25.640]  that's closed and doesn't release anything,
[38:25.640 --> 38:27.440]  which might be good for the privately held
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.800]  Wonka Chocolate Company, but is not good at all
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.800]  for the publicly held Apple Incorporated.
[38:34.800 --> 38:36.360]  And then what would be the other thing to do?
[38:36.360 --> 38:38.840]  To not release Apple Watch 2,
[38:38.840 --> 38:40.880]  which they could do this year,
[38:40.880 --> 38:43.160]  but just to make Apple Watch 1 users happy?
[38:43.160 --> 38:46.320]  Well, that's suicide in the tech world.
[38:46.320 --> 38:47.960]  You can't just sell an old thing
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.600]  so you don't annoy the people who've had it.
[38:52.600 --> 38:54.040]  I mean, this is the, you know,
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.200]  I think Steve Jobs said it about as well as anybody could,
[38:57.200 --> 38:59.040]  not really with a year over year upgrade,
[38:59.040 --> 39:01.440]  but when the, back in 2007,
[39:01.440 --> 39:03.920]  when the price dropped of the iPhone
[39:03.920 --> 39:06.120]  two or three months after it first came out,
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.240]  it was like, hey, this is technology.
[39:10.240 --> 39:11.640]  It moves fast, you know.
[39:11.640 --> 39:14.280]  We're trying to make this as fast as possible
[39:14.280 --> 39:17.120]  and sell it at the best price we can, as fast as we can.
[39:17.120 --> 39:20.680]  And we can't worry about breaking eggs along the way.
[39:20.680 --> 39:22.240]  And for the thing, people do get angry,
[39:22.240 --> 39:24.800]  but for me, the explaining, at least the best as we can,
[39:24.800 --> 39:25.920]  what Apple is thinking,
[39:25.920 --> 39:27.840]  at least it lets people hate Apple intelligently.
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.680]  Instead of hating them
[39:28.680 --> 39:30.240]  for superficial reactionary reasons,
[39:30.240 --> 39:31.440]  they can listen to the explanation,
[39:31.440 --> 39:32.680]  understand the point of view,
[39:32.680 --> 39:34.480]  and then hate them for good reason.
[39:36.480 --> 39:38.160]  It does, it is.
[39:38.160 --> 39:40.200]  I heard a lot of people say it.
[39:40.200 --> 39:45.160]  I mean, I bought my stainless steel Apple Watch
[39:45.160 --> 39:47.680]  with my eyes wide open knowing that
[39:47.680 --> 39:50.440]  it's probably only going to be good for a year.
[39:51.440 --> 39:52.280]  And I'm an idiot.
[39:52.280 --> 39:54.720]  I just throw money away on all sorts of Apple stuff.
[39:55.720 --> 39:58.000]  I think the people who are sensible about it,
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.680]  and lots and lots of people I heard from said,
[40:00.680 --> 40:04.000]  I'm willing to wait a year to get my first Apple Watch.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.600]  Very sensible, very sensible take.
[40:06.600 --> 40:08.680]  And if that's the type of personality
[40:08.680 --> 40:12.280]  you have, I think you're going to be very satisfied
[40:12.280 --> 40:13.280]  with that patience.
[40:13.280 --> 40:16.320]  Or people who are maybe slightly less patience
[40:16.320 --> 40:18.320]  or maybe had more money willing to throw away.
[40:18.320 --> 40:19.840]  People who said, I'm going to get one,
[40:19.840 --> 40:21.080]  but I'm going to get the sport model
[40:21.080 --> 40:23.480]  because I bet I'm going to want to get a new one
[40:23.480 --> 40:24.320]  the next year.
[40:24.320 --> 40:25.160]  All very pretty.
[40:25.160 --> 40:27.040]  Well, some people never want the Rev A board,
[40:27.040 --> 40:28.960]  and some people always want to be on the ground floor
[40:28.960 --> 40:29.800]  of a new technology.
[40:29.800 --> 40:31.280]  And there's different kinds of personalities.
[40:31.280 --> 40:32.120]  Not everyone's the same.
[40:32.120 --> 40:33.840]  And you can sort of pick the one that you want,
[40:33.840 --> 40:35.480]  and it's up to you to make an informed,
[40:35.480 --> 40:36.920]  rational adult decision.
[40:36.920 --> 40:38.760]  Yeah.
[40:38.760 --> 40:41.840]  All right, one last prediction on the Apple Watch.
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.160]  Do you agree that it'll probably be announced in March?
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.600]  Yeah, I think this year's March event
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.680]  will pretty closely mirror last year's.
[40:48.680 --> 40:53.400]  Do you think that it will be more like the Apple
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.240]  or the iPhone 3G or the 3GS?
[40:59.240 --> 41:01.000]  See, that's interesting because the 3G famously,
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.760]  the Apple didn't count it as a full version.
[41:02.760 --> 41:04.280]  It was a one comma product.
[41:04.280 --> 41:05.400]  It wasn't the two comma product.
[41:05.400 --> 41:06.960]  That was the 3GS.
[41:06.960 --> 41:09.400]  So it was basically what the iPhone was meant to be
[41:09.400 --> 41:12.880]  from an internal, at least tracking perspective,
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.160]  where I think Apple Watch hardware, to your point,
[41:16.160 --> 41:17.000]  will be similar.
[41:17.000 --> 41:18.080]  I don't know what they're going to designate it,
[41:18.080 --> 41:20.520]  but I think I'm in agreement with you on that.
[41:20.520 --> 41:22.040]  That it's going to be more of a rounding out
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.600]  the way watchOS 2 was then another leap forward.
[41:26.600 --> 41:29.120]  So which one do you think it's going to be more like?
[41:29.120 --> 41:30.600]  I think it'll be more like the 3G.
[41:30.600 --> 41:32.640]  And keeping in mind that Apple often
[41:32.640 --> 41:34.320]  has a conservative version of the 3G.
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.080]  It has a conservative version of a product
[41:36.080 --> 41:38.440]  and a very aspirational version of a product.
[41:38.440 --> 41:39.280]  And they have to figure out
[41:39.280 --> 41:41.280]  which one they can reliably deliver any year.
[41:41.280 --> 41:43.200]  I think they absolutely have both ready.
[41:43.200 --> 41:45.440]  But I think based on the Apple Watch this year,
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.520]  I think we'll get more like the 3G version.
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.360]  I wonder, I was kind of thinking
[41:50.360 --> 41:52.440]  maybe it would be more like a 3GS.
[41:53.720 --> 41:58.200]  Like maybe more like, to compare them,
[41:58.200 --> 42:03.200]  more like the original iPhone didn't exist.
[42:03.200 --> 42:07.200]  That we started with the 3G and we're going to the 3GS.
[42:07.200 --> 42:08.040]  In other words, it'll look a lot-
[42:08.040 --> 42:10.880]  The iPad 2 is a better comparison.
[42:10.880 --> 42:12.480]  Let me talk to this thinner.
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.320]  I agree with you.
[42:13.320 --> 42:14.160]  I think it's the inverse
[42:14.160 --> 42:15.760]  because the iPhone 3G got a better radio
[42:15.760 --> 42:17.960]  but not a better processor.
[42:17.960 --> 42:20.080]  And I think the Apple Watch 2
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.240]  is going to get the better processor,
[42:21.240 --> 42:23.000]  not necessarily the radios.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.120]  Right, that's what I'm thinking.
[42:24.120 --> 42:25.680]  I'm thinking a better processor.
[42:25.680 --> 42:28.560]  And yeah, probably not better radios.
[42:28.560 --> 42:29.400]  Well, we'll see.
[42:29.400 --> 42:30.840]  I don't know, maybe I'm making sure of the two.
[42:30.840 --> 42:32.480]  And maybe you're right that the iPad 2
[42:32.480 --> 42:34.040]  is maybe the better example.
[42:34.040 --> 42:36.000]  Although the iPad 2 is really largely
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.360]  about making the thing thinner.
[42:38.360 --> 42:39.440]  Yeah, later.
[42:39.440 --> 42:41.080]  I don't think we're going to see that with the watch.
[42:41.080 --> 42:43.440]  I don't think we're going to see a thinner version.
[42:43.440 --> 42:44.680]  I don't think we need to.
[42:44.680 --> 42:46.040]  Well, we will eventually.
[42:46.040 --> 42:46.880]  And I'm sure-
[42:49.680 --> 42:51.000]  We never need to.
[42:51.000 --> 42:51.960]  I mean, there's-
[42:53.120 --> 42:55.920]  But inevitably they're going to get to a point
[42:55.920 --> 42:59.880]  where Johnny Ive's team is going to start pressing the-
[42:59.880 --> 43:02.880]  No, no, we're going to make it a lot thinner.
[43:02.880 --> 43:04.280]  Well, they typically make things thinner
[43:04.280 --> 43:05.440]  because they want to make them lighter
[43:05.440 --> 43:07.560]  because lighter for them is essential to usability.
[43:07.560 --> 43:10.560]  But things like the Apple TV, 3D Touch,
[43:10.560 --> 43:12.320]  there are exceptions to that rule for them.
[43:12.320 --> 43:13.160]  There's things that they believe
[43:13.160 --> 43:15.320]  are important enough features or capabilities
[43:15.320 --> 43:16.760]  that they're going to just blow through
[43:16.760 --> 43:18.520]  the envelopes on that.
[43:18.520 --> 43:20.160]  But they have a huge thermal-
[43:20.160 --> 43:22.160]  My understanding is that the S1 runs as hot
[43:22.160 --> 43:24.480]  as it physically can for that enclosure.
[43:24.480 --> 43:26.400]  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised,
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.040]  especially given how slow some things are.
[43:29.040 --> 43:29.880]  Yeah.
[43:29.880 --> 43:30.720]  That there's just no way.
[43:30.720 --> 43:31.800]  So anyway, we'll see.
[43:31.800 --> 43:33.280]  I'm excited about it.
[43:33.280 --> 43:34.520]  There was something else that was really cool
[43:34.520 --> 43:35.360]  about the March event,
[43:35.360 --> 43:37.800]  and that was sort of the coming out of Jeff Williams.
[43:37.800 --> 43:39.000]  Like he introduced ResearchKit,
[43:39.000 --> 43:40.560]  and that was the first time we saw
[43:40.560 --> 43:42.920]  who's arguably one of the most powerful people
[43:42.920 --> 43:44.680]  at Apple on the stage.
[43:44.680 --> 43:46.920]  Right, he went from beginning of the year,
[43:46.920 --> 43:51.600]  had appeared on stage and was sort of a-
[43:51.600 --> 43:52.920]  You know, it wasn't a secret.
[43:52.920 --> 43:55.880]  I mean, it's there on the press bios page
[43:55.880 --> 43:58.960]  for Apple executives, but wasn't really a secret.
[43:58.960 --> 44:01.280]  Wasn't really known publicly by the end of the year.
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.120]  He'd been promoted to Chief Operating Officer.
[44:04.120 --> 44:05.080]  Yeah, and had been on stage.
[44:05.080 --> 44:06.080]  I think he was at WWC.
[44:06.080 --> 44:07.600]  He was definitely at the September event,
[44:07.600 --> 44:09.200]  and he owned the watch this year.
[44:09.200 --> 44:11.520]  It was his project.
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.240]  Yes, that is actually true and not well-known
[44:16.240 --> 44:21.160]  and, you know, kind of a-
[44:21.160 --> 44:22.160]  I thought about this,
[44:22.160 --> 44:23.640]  and I didn't write much about it,
[44:23.640 --> 44:25.960]  but I thought about it when they made the announcement
[44:25.960 --> 44:29.920]  a week or two ago about the executive-
[44:29.920 --> 44:32.080]  Not really changes, it's more or less promotions,
[44:32.080 --> 44:35.000]  and like you wrote in your piece at iMore,
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.840]  sort of making official changes
[44:36.840 --> 44:38.800]  that have been made internally for a while.
[44:38.800 --> 44:41.320]  Like Johnny Suruji's stature within the company
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.880]  was SVP level in terms of the respect that he has
[44:45.880 --> 44:48.200]  and the understanding of how important it is.
[44:48.200 --> 44:49.560]  It just wasn't reflected in his official-
[44:49.560 --> 44:51.840]  You do the job before you get the title at Apple.
[44:51.840 --> 44:54.600]  Right, and I was thinking about it
[44:54.600 --> 44:57.120]  with Jeff Williams,
[44:57.120 --> 45:02.920]  and clearly part of the gravity of being named COO of Apple
[45:02.920 --> 45:06.480]  is that in the modern era, which, again,
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.200]  I always say is post-next reunification,
[45:10.200 --> 45:12.120]  there's only ever been one other COO,
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.040]  and that was Tim Cook, and we see,
[45:14.040 --> 45:17.320]  you know, what that meant for him.
[45:17.320 --> 45:20.600]  And, you know, it clearly meant that he was number two
[45:20.600 --> 45:23.080]  and in line to take over as CEO
[45:23.080 --> 45:24.920]  if anything happened to the CEO,
[45:24.920 --> 45:27.080]  and I think, you know, it's hard not to think
[45:27.080 --> 45:29.560]  the same with Jeff Williams.
[45:29.560 --> 45:31.440]  And the other thing, too, that made me think about it
[45:31.440 --> 45:35.080]  is that to my knowledge, when Tim Cook was COO,
[45:35.080 --> 45:38.560]  he never really had the role over a new product
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.920]  the way that Jeff Williams did with the watch in particular.
[45:42.920 --> 45:44.280]  Yeah, it was a different-
[45:44.280 --> 45:46.680]  Like the iPhone was the clear example
[45:46.680 --> 45:47.720]  of the big new product category,
[45:47.720 --> 45:49.560]  and that Scott Forestall basically owned.
[45:49.560 --> 45:50.720]  I mean, Steve Jobs owned everything,
[45:50.720 --> 45:53.320]  but Scott Forestall was the closest to not being Steve Jobs
[45:53.320 --> 45:55.320]  and owning a product.
[45:55.320 --> 45:57.320]  And there's no sort of Scott Forestall
[45:57.320 --> 45:58.440]  that's all been unified now,
[45:58.440 --> 46:00.720]  and they do have, you know, Kevin Lynch,
[46:00.720 --> 46:02.480]  but he's doing just the software.
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.720]  And I think a brand new product,
[46:03.720 --> 46:06.080]  it needs somebody to sort of incubate it
[46:06.080 --> 46:08.880]  and take care of it as a specific new product
[46:08.880 --> 46:11.720]  before it can get reintegrated into the existing structure
[46:11.720 --> 46:14.200]  in Apple that ships iPhones and iPads every year.
[46:14.200 --> 46:18.760]  Yeah, and I think that the operational angle on that is,
[46:18.760 --> 46:22.200]  and again, I don't have the numbers off the top of my head,
[46:22.200 --> 46:26.000]  but I think, I mean,
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.720]  the number of iPhones they sold in 2007 was
[46:31.440 --> 46:34.280]  maybe, I don't know, just a few million.
[46:34.280 --> 46:36.040]  It was in the millions, yeah.
[46:36.040 --> 46:38.360]  Of that first one until, you know,
[46:38.360 --> 46:41.960]  the one with the metal casing was really, really small
[46:41.960 --> 46:42.800]  in the millions.
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.480]  And I think they got to 10 million by the end of 2008,
[46:47.480 --> 46:50.160]  which would be a full year of selling the original iPhone
[46:50.160 --> 46:53.960]  and then six or seven months of selling the 3G.
[46:53.960 --> 46:54.800]  But it was really-
[46:54.800 --> 46:56.320]  When they hit subsidies that it took off.
[46:56.320 --> 46:58.160]  Yeah, and it's really with the 3G
[46:58.160 --> 47:00.400]  where production really ramped up.
[47:02.360 --> 47:04.400]  And for all of our, like,
[47:04.400 --> 47:06.320]  we just mentioned it earlier in the show,
[47:06.320 --> 47:07.560]  all of the bitching and moaning
[47:07.560 --> 47:10.320]  about the early production delays
[47:10.320 --> 47:12.440]  on the Apple Watch in April and May,
[47:13.720 --> 47:16.960]  here we are just, you know, nine months later
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.240]  and we've gone through a Christmas
[47:18.240 --> 47:21.600]  where there were no supply problems.
[47:21.600 --> 47:23.440]  And they've sold way more Apple Watches
[47:23.440 --> 47:24.760]  when we don't know exactly what,
[47:24.760 --> 47:25.840]  because they're not, how many,
[47:25.840 --> 47:27.440]  because they're not breaking them out.
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.280]  But it's clear that they've sold way more Apple Watches
[47:31.280 --> 47:34.880]  in this first year than they did iPhones in its first year.
[47:34.880 --> 47:35.720]  And it's just-
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.920]  And they were able to do it internationally,
[47:36.920 --> 47:38.000]  which the original iPhone wasn't.
[47:38.000 --> 47:39.000]  It was available in one country
[47:39.000 --> 47:40.560]  and then maybe three or four countries
[47:40.560 --> 47:41.480]  for most of that year.
[47:41.480 --> 47:43.240]  Yeah, that's also very true.
[47:43.240 --> 47:44.520]  Yeah, and it's, again,
[47:44.520 --> 47:46.320]  and I'm not saying that I don't bring this up
[47:46.320 --> 47:49.800]  to posit that the Apple Watch is on pace
[47:49.800 --> 47:52.080]  to be more popular than the iPhone.
[47:52.080 --> 47:53.120]  I think it's clearly,
[47:53.120 --> 47:55.760]  just because Apple as a company and its products,
[47:55.760 --> 47:59.280]  that it is, you know, it's more of a cultural phenomenon
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.760]  and it can make a new product known to people
[48:03.760 --> 48:06.080]  in a way that it couldn't before.
[48:06.080 --> 48:08.960]  And they've broadened their base of people
[48:08.960 --> 48:12.040]  who consider themselves Apple customers.
[48:12.040 --> 48:15.160]  And the iPod, it took a while for the iPod to ramp up
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.840]  until after it became available on Windows.
[48:16.840 --> 48:18.040]  It took a while for the iPhone to ramp up.
[48:18.040 --> 48:19.760]  The iPad ramped up incredibly quickly,
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.080]  but then it also sloped down fast too.
[48:22.080 --> 48:23.000]  And it feels like, you know,
[48:23.000 --> 48:24.520]  you're on a highway that has a speed limit.
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.560]  And regardless of how fast you accelerate,
[48:26.560 --> 48:27.760]  there's still that speed limit.
[48:27.760 --> 48:29.360]  So you can have initial bursts
[48:29.360 --> 48:31.000]  or you could have a slow acceleration,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  but all the products sort of get there in the end.
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.160]  I also think that with the iPad,
[48:35.160 --> 48:39.760]  which I think sold somewhere between like 10 and 15 million
[48:39.760 --> 48:40.800]  in its first year.
[48:42.400 --> 48:43.240]  Don't quote me on that,
[48:43.240 --> 48:44.640]  but I'm pretty sure that's ballpark.
[48:44.640 --> 48:49.440]  I remember being on a TV show,
[48:49.440 --> 48:51.840]  Clayton Morris' show with people guessing
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.240]  at first year sales.
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.200]  And it was like me and Andy and Atko.
[48:55.200 --> 48:58.920]  And I think Jason Snell, I forget who else was on,
[48:58.920 --> 49:01.600]  but my guess, yeah, Jason was on remotely.
[49:02.840 --> 49:05.000]  And my guess was way higher than everybody else's.
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.520]  And I was still a little low of what actually turned out.
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.520]  But even then I feel like making that original iPad
[49:13.520 --> 49:16.360]  wasn't anywhere near as much of a stretch operationally
[49:16.360 --> 49:18.640]  because they had three years under their belt
[49:18.640 --> 49:21.160]  of making iPhones and the technology was fundamentally
[49:21.160 --> 49:22.880]  the same, except this was bigger.
[49:22.880 --> 49:25.720]  And so in some ways that makes it easier.
[49:25.720 --> 49:27.400]  Whereas with the watch,
[49:27.400 --> 49:31.920]  here they are taking these iPhone style chips
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.240]  and display technology and et cetera,
[49:35.240 --> 49:37.680]  and making a really, really small thing
[49:37.680 --> 49:39.480]  with incredibly tight tolerance
[49:39.480 --> 49:42.800]  for so many of these things physically that it was harder.
[49:42.800 --> 49:43.640]  I feel like it was a-
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.400]  Yeah, iPad ran, it even ran what was called iPhone OS
[49:46.400 --> 49:47.720]  at the time where with watch OS,
[49:47.720 --> 49:49.440]  they created that separate interface layer
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.040]  for like the clock faces and for carousel
[49:51.040 --> 49:51.880]  and for some other thing.
[49:51.880 --> 49:52.720]  Right.
[49:54.720 --> 49:56.680]  The only big difference I think is that there was also
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.080]  10 years of phones before the iPhone
[49:58.080 --> 49:59.680]  and 10 years of tablets before the iPad.
[49:59.680 --> 50:01.000]  So they sort of knew what the problems were
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.080]  that they wanted to fix, where with the Apple Watch,
[50:03.080 --> 50:06.040]  they entered the product category very quickly.
[50:06.040 --> 50:08.320]  And there isn't as much evidence as what,
[50:08.320 --> 50:10.600]  they don't have as much information about what that product
[50:10.600 --> 50:12.480]  needs to be, but they're not as much evidence
[50:12.480 --> 50:13.360]  that it needs to be.
[50:13.360 --> 50:16.120]  They're sort of part of the experiment for the first time.
[50:16.120 --> 50:16.960]  Yeah.
[50:16.960 --> 50:17.800]  All right, let's take a break.
[50:17.800 --> 50:19.960]  I'll thank another sponsor and then we'll go,
[50:19.960 --> 50:22.320]  next up is WWDC, right?
[50:22.320 --> 50:23.160]  Yep.
[50:23.160 --> 50:24.000]  All right.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.560]  Well, our next sponsor is our good friends at Automattic.
[50:27.560 --> 50:28.400]  What is it?
[50:28.400 --> 50:31.280]  Automattic is a connected car adapter.
[50:31.280 --> 50:33.280]  I call it, I like to call it a dingus.
[50:33.280 --> 50:36.640]  It's a dingus and it plugs into your car's diagnostic port.
[50:39.240 --> 50:40.840]  All these cars have the exact same port.
[50:40.840 --> 50:44.160]  Every car manufactured since 1996 has one of these ports.
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.120]  It's this thing that when you take it in,
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.920]  take your car into the dealer or your local auto shop,
[50:49.920 --> 50:51.600]  they just plug a thing into the same port
[50:51.600 --> 50:53.880]  and it tells them all this diagnostic information
[50:53.880 --> 50:54.880]  about your car.
[50:54.880 --> 50:57.800]  If you have like a warning, like come on there or,
[50:57.800 --> 50:59.960]  hey, go, you need to go get your oil changed.
[50:59.960 --> 51:04.040]  And it says like, go get service A1 or something like that.
[51:05.080 --> 51:07.960]  If you have Automattic, you plug it into your car,
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.600]  it tells you exactly what that means.
[51:09.600 --> 51:11.440]  It actually decodes it and tells you,
[51:11.440 --> 51:13.480]  or if there's like a problem with the car,
[51:13.480 --> 51:15.840]  not just like regular service,
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.160]  but they say like, error code F2 or something like that.
[51:21.560 --> 51:23.840]  Automattic can tell you exactly what that means.
[51:23.840 --> 51:24.800]  And you'll know whether it's,
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.560]  hey, this is actually serious or B, this is,
[51:28.560 --> 51:29.800]  yeah, something you gotta get looked at,
[51:29.800 --> 51:32.360]  but you can finish going where you're going
[51:32.360 --> 51:33.560]  and not worry about it.
[51:34.400 --> 51:35.680]  Really, really useful.
[51:35.680 --> 51:37.360]  It just totally opens up exactly
[51:37.360 --> 51:38.600]  what's going on with your car.
[51:38.600 --> 51:41.640]  And it's kind of remarkable how much modern cars know
[51:41.640 --> 51:44.960]  about what's going on system-wide throughout the whole car.
[51:46.240 --> 51:47.800]  And it does all sorts of other things too.
[51:47.800 --> 51:51.400]  It hooks up to your phone and uses GPS
[51:51.400 --> 51:54.560]  and it can give you a log of your trips and parking location.
[51:54.560 --> 51:56.800]  It can use the GPS while you're driving
[51:56.800 --> 52:00.480]  to sort of rate your fuel economy
[52:00.480 --> 52:03.200]  and your efficiency, score you on that.
[52:03.200 --> 52:08.200]  And they have a new app store for Automattic.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.120]  And you go there and it lets you hook up
[52:11.120 --> 52:11.960]  all sorts of things.
[52:11.960 --> 52:13.320]  And you do this by using your phone.
[52:13.320 --> 52:15.200]  You just have your phone paired with Bluetooth
[52:15.200 --> 52:17.160]  to the automatic in your car.
[52:17.160 --> 52:19.040]  And you can hook up all sorts of cool things
[52:19.040 --> 52:22.480]  like IFTTT, that's if that, if this, then that,
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.640]  and set up all sorts of scenarios where it says,
[52:25.640 --> 52:30.640]  if you get within five miles of your home,
[52:30.640 --> 52:33.080]  you could have it hook up to your Nest thermostat
[52:33.080 --> 52:35.680]  and have it turn on the heat or in the summer,
[52:35.680 --> 52:37.120]  turn on the air conditioning,
[52:38.280 --> 52:40.000]  all sorts of recipes like that.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.040]  They have lots and lots of apps.
[52:42.040 --> 52:43.880]  Over 20 apps are in their app store.
[52:43.880 --> 52:47.040]  You can go check it out at automatic.com slash apps
[52:47.040 --> 52:49.720]  and see the sort of things that are available.
[52:49.720 --> 52:53.200]  Bottom line, this is all really, really cool stuff.
[52:53.200 --> 52:57.000]  It works on any kind of car, any car made after 1996.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.160]  So it's not like you need a certain brand
[52:59.160 --> 53:00.640]  or something like that, a certain model.
[53:00.640 --> 53:03.480]  Any car you just plug this thing in, it hooks it up,
[53:03.480 --> 53:06.040]  even can tell you things like where you parked your car
[53:06.040 --> 53:09.040]  because it has this GPS and it can remember stuff like that.
[53:10.200 --> 53:11.200]  How much is it?
[53:11.200 --> 53:12.120]  Well, here's the thing.
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.640]  It is super, super, it's amazingly cheap.
[53:14.640 --> 53:18.480]  It's just $100, $99, 95 cents normally,
[53:18.480 --> 53:23.120]  but they have a 20% off offer for talk show listeners.
[53:23.120 --> 53:23.960]  That's 20 bucks.
[53:23.960 --> 53:27.000]  You'll save 20 bucks on this thing, get it for $80
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  by going to automatic.com slash the talk show.
[53:31.000 --> 53:34.160]  Automatic, just spelled like the dictionary word,
[53:34.160 --> 53:36.360]  dot com slash the talk show.
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.600]  It ships in two business days.
[53:38.600 --> 53:40.560]  You'll get it just two days from now
[53:40.560 --> 53:41.520]  after you listen to the show.
[53:41.520 --> 53:42.760]  Go order it right now.
[53:42.760 --> 53:44.440]  And here's the last thing I'll say,
[53:44.440 --> 53:47.880]  45 day return policy with free shipping.
[53:47.880 --> 53:49.440]  So if you buy it,
[53:49.440 --> 53:51.440]  you don't feel like this thing's worth 80 bucks.
[53:51.440 --> 53:53.600]  You got 45 days to send it back to them
[53:53.600 --> 53:56.040]  and no money is out of your wallet.
[53:56.040 --> 53:57.240]  My thanks to Automac.
[53:58.800 --> 54:00.800]  All right, WWDC.
[54:00.800 --> 54:02.400]  Well, there was one thing right before WWDC
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.360]  that was super interesting.
[54:03.360 --> 54:04.800]  And that was Johnny Ive getting promoted
[54:04.800 --> 54:06.120]  to chief design officer.
[54:06.120 --> 54:07.120]  Oh, that is true.
[54:07.120 --> 54:09.280]  New direct reports going right to Tim Cook.
[54:12.040 --> 54:13.960]  Yeah, who was new direct reports?
[54:13.960 --> 54:15.360]  It was Alan Dye.
[54:15.360 --> 54:17.480]  Yeah, and Haworth, I'm forgetting his first name.
[54:17.480 --> 54:18.320]  Richard?
[54:18.320 --> 54:19.320]  Richard Haworth, yes.
[54:21.880 --> 54:23.240]  And that created this whole,
[54:23.240 --> 54:24.360]  is Johnny Ive leaving?
[54:24.360 --> 54:25.520]  Is this role changing?
[54:25.520 --> 54:27.800]  It was, again, a lot of noise.
[54:27.800 --> 54:28.880]  I think over the course of the year,
[54:28.880 --> 54:30.880]  no one even really thinks about it anymore.
[54:30.880 --> 54:32.160]  No, I don't think so.
[54:33.960 --> 54:35.280]  And I get the feeling,
[54:35.280 --> 54:37.240]  I don't feel like,
[54:39.400 --> 54:42.440]  again, would it be the biggest shock in the world
[54:42.440 --> 54:44.480]  if he leaves in a couple of years?
[54:44.480 --> 54:45.320]  I guess not.
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.560]  I mean, you never know.
[54:47.560 --> 54:49.080]  And he's obviously a very private person.
[54:49.080 --> 54:50.280]  You don't really know.
[54:52.280 --> 54:54.680]  If you don't know him, how could you say?
[54:54.680 --> 54:56.520]  And this could then be seen in hindsight
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.560]  as a precursor to that.
[55:00.560 --> 55:01.800]  But my guess is no,
[55:01.800 --> 55:03.480]  because from what I do know of him
[55:03.480 --> 55:08.040]  and what's obvious is if he's obsessive about design,
[55:08.040 --> 55:09.600]  what else is he going to do?
[55:09.600 --> 55:11.680]  It seems to me like what he would want to do
[55:11.680 --> 55:13.960]  if he could do whatever he wanted to all day, every day,
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.000]  is run Apple's design team.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.560]  Well, we saw that in the 60 Minutes special.
[55:18.560 --> 55:20.440]  They showed everything from his little sketchbook
[55:20.440 --> 55:22.160]  where he made the watch designs
[55:22.160 --> 55:24.640]  to the CNC machine spitting it out behind him,
[55:24.640 --> 55:26.800]  to his glee over the giant glass panels
[55:26.800 --> 55:30.240]  being installed at campus too.
[55:30.240 --> 55:31.080]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:31.080 --> 55:33.840]  The biggest pieces of curved glass ever made.
[55:33.840 --> 55:35.080]  Yeah. That's pretty interesting.
[55:35.080 --> 55:36.280]  What a great job.
[55:36.280 --> 55:37.120]  Yeah.
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.120]  And I feel like what the promotion of Dai and Hohorth
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.960]  really meant was that it frees him up
[55:44.960 --> 55:49.960]  from administrative and bureaucratic responsibilities,
[55:49.960 --> 55:53.600]  that there are meetings now that instead of he attending,
[55:53.600 --> 55:55.440]  Dai and or Hohorth can attend.
[55:57.280 --> 55:59.480]  And just things like for people on the design team,
[55:59.480 --> 56:02.120]  like approving vacation schedules or whatever else,
[56:02.120 --> 56:03.520]  the kind of administrative stuff
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.960]  that somebody has to be in charge of.
[56:05.960 --> 56:07.280]  It's not him anymore.
[56:07.280 --> 56:08.120]  And that he can-
[56:08.120 --> 56:08.960]  Yeah, and I think it's similar
[56:08.960 --> 56:10.320]  to what we'll talk about with Phil Schiller later,
[56:10.320 --> 56:12.000]  where it removes bottlenecks from the process
[56:12.000 --> 56:13.960]  of Apple as Apple scales.
[56:13.960 --> 56:15.320]  Yeah, I think so.
[56:15.320 --> 56:17.200]  And I think it lets him,
[56:17.200 --> 56:20.520]  it lets him spend more time on what he's drawn to,
[56:20.520 --> 56:23.720]  as opposed to what he, the paraphernalia,
[56:23.720 --> 56:25.720]  the miscellaneous stuff that you have to do.
[56:27.800 --> 56:32.320]  That's just sort of busy work.
[56:32.320 --> 56:34.240]  I don't know, for lack of a better term.
[56:34.240 --> 56:35.960]  Yeah, there's two universal truths in big businesses.
[56:35.960 --> 56:38.200]  That is, everyone wants more management and more power,
[56:38.200 --> 56:40.080]  and then anyone who has it wants to get rid of it.
[56:40.080 --> 56:43.400]  Yeah, and maybe that's exactly what this was about.
[56:43.400 --> 56:45.240]  And I think that's what we're talking about.
[56:45.240 --> 56:47.320]  That's exactly what this was about.
[56:47.320 --> 56:48.840]  And I kind of get the feeling
[56:48.840 --> 56:52.880]  that both Dai and Holworth are very, very trusted by Ive.
[56:52.880 --> 56:53.880]  Yeah.
[56:53.880 --> 56:55.720]  And so it's not,
[56:55.720 --> 56:58.520]  I don't think there's any kind of Machiavellian aspect to it
[56:58.520 --> 57:00.360]  where they're angling to take over.
[57:00.360 --> 57:03.200]  I feel like they're at the stage in their careers
[57:03.200 --> 57:06.360]  where they're looking for more management and authority.
[57:06.360 --> 57:08.320]  And Ive, I really do think it's as simple
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.880]  as that he just wants to spend,
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.240]  he's only got so many hours in the day, every day,
[57:14.240 --> 57:17.760]  and wants to spend them obsessing over every,
[57:17.760 --> 57:20.160]  you know, design, period.
[57:20.160 --> 57:21.000]  Whether it's-
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.040]  And their teams are fantastic.
[57:22.040 --> 57:24.280]  Like the ID team and the HI teams,
[57:24.280 --> 57:26.520]  they said only two people have ever left ID
[57:26.520 --> 57:27.960]  over the history of Ive's tenure,
[57:27.960 --> 57:29.920]  and those teams know what they're doing.
[57:29.920 --> 57:30.760]  Yeah.
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.200]  Well, and it's a very small team.
[57:32.200 --> 57:35.160]  I mean, and if there is a bottleneck still within the company
[57:35.160 --> 57:38.560]  that might be part of it, but I don't know that it's,
[57:38.560 --> 57:39.480]  you know, I think it's clearly
[57:39.480 --> 57:41.360]  one of those mythical man month type things
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.640]  where throwing more people at it
[57:42.640 --> 57:45.440]  isn't going to make more better design come out.
[57:45.440 --> 57:47.280]  I liked that in that 60 minutes special,
[57:47.280 --> 57:49.040]  one of the things I really liked seeing
[57:49.040 --> 57:54.040]  was that they brought out the 10 prototype iPhone 6s.
[57:57.040 --> 57:57.880]  Yes.
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.880]  From every size, you know, from four inches up to,
[58:03.680 --> 58:06.400]  I'm not quite sure what that biggest was, probably six.
[58:06.400 --> 58:11.400]  But that they had 10 different iPhone 6 shapes.
[58:12.600 --> 58:14.640]  And I don't know that, you know,
[58:14.640 --> 58:16.120]  they didn't turn them on so you couldn't see
[58:16.120 --> 58:18.160]  whether they were actually like electronic device,
[58:18.160 --> 58:19.920]  you know, like working iPhones,
[58:19.920 --> 58:22.960]  or were they just things that you held in your hand?
[58:22.960 --> 58:25.920]  But they had all 10 of them there for them to display.
[58:25.920 --> 58:27.680]  I thought that was pretty cool.
[58:27.680 --> 58:29.480]  Yeah, and that it wasn't just about the size,
[58:29.480 --> 58:32.320]  but to Ive, that was part of the entire product experience
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.680]  of having a device of that size.
[58:36.680 --> 58:41.120]  Yeah, it's, you know, I believed it when I said that,
[58:41.120 --> 58:42.800]  you know, that was the story that they told
[58:42.800 --> 58:44.240]  when they came out with the two, you know,
[58:44.240 --> 58:48.280]  the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch iPhone 6 sizes.
[58:49.800 --> 58:52.520]  And they said, you know, we made 10 versions
[58:52.520 --> 58:56.160]  from every size from 4.0 up to I think 6.0 inches
[58:56.160 --> 58:58.400]  and that these were the two that felt right.
[58:59.600 --> 59:00.560]  But I thought it was pretty cool
[59:00.560 --> 59:03.080]  that they still had them there and brought them out.
[59:03.080 --> 59:05.920]  Yeah, everything else under tarps.
[59:05.920 --> 59:06.760]  Yeah.
[59:09.320 --> 59:10.360]  I like the story.
[59:10.360 --> 59:13.200]  It reminded me of the story from the New Yorker,
[59:13.200 --> 59:16.360]  which was the profile of Johnny Ive that came this year.
[59:16.360 --> 59:17.960]  I guess that was this year, right?
[59:17.960 --> 59:19.000]  Had to be.
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.360]  Yeah, it was right around the watch launch.
[59:20.360 --> 59:22.200]  Yeah, right around the watch launch.
[59:23.240 --> 59:27.040]  A truly, truly almost book length New Yorker profile
[59:27.040 --> 59:32.040]  on Johnny Ive and when he was in the,
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.280]  the guy who wrote it was in the design lab.
[59:35.280 --> 59:36.720]  One of the tables, you know,
[59:36.720 --> 59:39.280]  several of the tables had those black shrouds over them
[59:39.280 --> 59:40.560]  and you could see that, you know,
[59:40.560 --> 59:44.600]  that there was the outline, the shape of whatever it was,
[59:44.600 --> 59:45.880]  you could see like the vague shape
[59:45.880 --> 59:47.040]  of whatever it is they were covering.
[59:47.040 --> 59:49.400]  But then there was one where it was completely flat.
[59:49.400 --> 59:51.560]  It was just a table that was completely flat
[59:51.560 --> 59:53.480]  as though there was nothing on it.
[59:53.480 --> 59:55.000]  Why was it covered up?
[59:55.000 --> 59:56.000]  And then in hindsight,
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.480]  it was because that was the table
[59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.520]  that was going to be the Apple Watch display table,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.200]  where as a profile, as a three-dimensional shape,
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.280]  it's exactly the same as Apple standard tables,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.240]  but it has a glass top
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.560]  that displays the Apple Watches underneath.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.160]  Yeah, and that pretty ingenious thing
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.560]  where the badges open up the drawers
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.360]  underneath the retail staff.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.640]  Yeah, yeah, very true.
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.640]  It's a very clever design,
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.960]  but I think it's fat and it, to me,
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.960]  it's an emblem of the way that design
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.760]  is truly a first-class practice at Apple,
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.320]  that it's exactly the same team
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.440]  that is designing the tables that are in the stores
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.440]  to display the watch as who displayed the watch itself,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  designed the watch itself,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  and who designed the packaging for the watch, right?
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.480]  Yeah, they want to control the experience
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.160]  the entire way through the product's life, basically.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.280]  Right, the store itself is a product,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.960]  including the lighting,
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.240]  the surface that's used for the floor,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.680]  the dimensions, the tables.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.920]  The products themselves are products,
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.680]  and the packaging are products.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.880]  And the process is whereby that goes from the table
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.960]  to you in the bag,
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.880]  and the entire thing is just brilliantly engineered.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.720]  Yeah, and I feel like that's unique at Apple,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.560]  and I think it would be very difficult
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.720]  for other companies to replicate.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.160]  All right, June, WWDC.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.000]  Yes.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.800]  I would say the clunker of the bunch.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.800]  I think there was a three-fold announcement, fundamentally.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.200]  iOS 9, macOS 10.11,
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.200]  MacOS 10, 10.11, El Capitan, and Apple Music.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.280]  And I think Apple Music has got to be considered
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.520]  the clunker of the bunch.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.800]  Yeah, it was interesting,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.600]  because the first half, it was all...
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.160]  Yeah, and I think watchOS, too.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.480]  I think we saw that for the first time there,
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.720]  but that was all very engineering-focused,
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.520]  and Craig Federighi did his talk,
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.520]  and I think Kevin Lynch did the watch stuff.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.000]  Maybe it was Jeff Williams, I forget.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.960]  And then it was an incredibly abrupt change in tone
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.840]  when Eddy Cue, who was the director of the watch,
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.480]  Eddy Cue, and then Jimmy Iovine,
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.640]  and then Drake came out on stage,
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.800]  almost like a separate event
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.440]  that had been somehow stuck together.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.360]  Yeah, and it's funny to me, or interesting,
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.440]  because, again, treating all of these things not as...
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:34.560]  Well, it's easy to say,
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.960]  to try to treat the actual shipping products,
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.480]  the things you buy, the actual iPhone in your hand,
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.840]  the actual watch on your wrist,
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.200]  as the only things that matter,
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.840]  because that's ultimately the most important thing.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.600]  But I find it instructive, and it usually pays off,
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.720]  to treat everything from the actual, like, the events,
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.480]  to the packaging, to the ads, to all of it,
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.320]  as looking for signs of, you know,
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.960]  is this as polished and coherent as it could be?
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.720]  I think it's interesting,
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.680]  and, again, you can't prove a correlation,
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.280]  but it's interesting that the announcement event
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.760]  of Apple Music at WWDC's keynote
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.040]  was sloppy,
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.800]  and the actual shipping Apple Music,
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.240]  when it first came out, was sloppy,
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.360]  and not quite coherent.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.200]  Like, a sort of lack of coherence.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.120]  I think under Steve Jobs, like, he ran that show,
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.080]  and almost everything that went on during that show
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.480]  was carefully scrutinized,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.080]  and I think Tim Cook lets people run their divisions
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.920]  more than Steve Jobs did,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.280]  maybe because Apple's so big now, he has to, as well,
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.200]  and they almost run, like, little companies,
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.520]  especially iTunes, which, you know, has its own marketing,
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.480]  its own events, its own developers.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.400]  It basically is its own company,
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.320]  and when you see these things,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.120]  I don't know how much, like, someone like Tim Cook
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.440]  would play the Steve Jobs role of saying,
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.400]  no, you have to come out, and you have to say this,
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.480]  and I'm handling this, and you're doing this,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.520]  and it is more of a, it is more open
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:05.440]  to each of the SVPs to do their own thing,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.400]  and at the same time, some people just love
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.800]  the traditional Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.680]  It's super polished, there's some jokes,
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.800]  but it's super on point, it's clear, it's concise,
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.360]  and then Craig Federica gets laughs from making jokes,
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.480]  so the next year, we get more jokes,
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.520]  and then, you know, they start talking about Eddie
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.760]  doing karaoke, and suddenly, you know,
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.000]  Eddie's doing a little bit of dancing,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.160]  and I think that they're trying to feel their way
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.040]  into being a kinder, friendlier presentation,
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.200]  but they don't know where that line is yet.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:36.280]  Yeah, and I feel like that keynote in particular,
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.960]  I think without question, this year's WWDC keynote
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.640]  was the worst event Apple, the worst keynote,
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.240]  you know, not just call it an official keynote,
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.280]  I'll just say keynote to include, you know,
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.320]  product introductions like September's,
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]  you know, iPhone introduction.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.120]  It's the worst keynote that they've had since Steve died,
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.680]  or maybe the worst one they ever had,
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.200]  you know, in the modern era,
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.840]  because none of the ones with Steve were bad.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.880]  Do you feel that the whole way through,
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.240]  or just because of the Apple Music segment?
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.440]  I would say just because of the Apple Music segment,
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.240]  but the fact that it ran so long,
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.520]  even if the Apple Music segment had been coherent
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.160]  and well-thought out, I think the fact
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.080]  that they blew so far past two hours was a problem.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.040]  And I say this not just for the petty reason
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.440]  that I really had to go to the bathroom by the end of it,
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.120]  and I was in the audience,
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.880]  and just the fact that, you know,
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.080]  it's a long time to just sit.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.960]  I think like the unofficial rule
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.840]  that they should be two hours at the most is good,
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.480]  and I think it always plays out
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.760]  when you see other companies
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.720]  that have long events that go too long.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.160]  When it ends, you don't want the media
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.400]  who are giving most people out in the world,
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.760]  their impression of it comes not firsthand,
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.840]  because there's only, you know,
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.040]  even at a big place like WWDC, there's only 4,000 seats,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:05.840]  and most of them are, you know, conference attendees.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.400]  You don't want the first impression
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.000]  to be from media people saying that was too long.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.560]  But the other thing that you usually can see
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.160]  from other companies, and that with Steve Jobs there,
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.800]  it never happened,
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.800]  is you see the internal politics playing out on stage,
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.720]  the fighting over, you know,
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:28.280]  that stage time is political capital within the company,
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.280]  and whether it's good for the company or not,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.000]  that X number of people come out
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.200]  and get X number of minutes for their thing,
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.320]  they're all fighting for it,
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.240]  because they're fighting for their personal stature,
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:43.040]  or they're fighting for their product's stature
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.240]  within the company,
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.560]  as opposed to what is the best thing
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.080]  for the company as a whole, you know?
[01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.640]  And I think Apple has, you know,
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.480]  this year as well as any other year,
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.040]  with Apple, there are always products
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.680]  that in and of themselves might be worth time
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.000]  in a product introduction or a keynote,
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.480]  if there's a keynote coming up,
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.760]  but get cut because there are so many other,
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.080]  other things that are more worth it for them,
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.520]  if they're only gonna go for 90 minutes.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.360]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.160]  And I believe stuff was cut from this keynote.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.680]  Like my understanding is they wanted to get it down
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.000]  to two hours, but especially the Apple Music segment,
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.080]  it didn't even sound like it stayed on script,
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.840]  which is something else that you don't see
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.200]  in previous keynotes.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.520]  Yeah.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.360]  Yeah.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.600]  Like, and you know, like Drake's like inexplicable,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.040]  like what the hell, you know, what was that?
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.960]  Like, I just remember going back to my notes
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.480]  and it was like, my notes are like Drake,
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.400]  and then it's like nothing.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.720]  And some people who aren't us,
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.960]  who were very young and very hip,
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.520]  loved that Drake was on stage,
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.960]  but I think when you look at it overall
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960]  in terms of an Apple event,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.320]  it doesn't become part of the cohesive whole.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.640]  Right, usually in a good one,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.680]  it doesn't matter whether the person,
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.960]  if it's a very, you know,
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.280]  if it's some kind of famous celebrity
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.320]  or something like that, there still is a,
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.880]  there's, you can see whether you agree with it or not,
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.280]  whether it worked for you personally,
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.240]  you can understand what the point was
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.760]  that that person was supposed to get across.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.640]  If you could cut it and it doesn't affect the event,
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.480]  you should cut it.
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.840]  And likewise, like Tim Cook's segue into baseball,
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.600]  which was interesting, but like you could have cut
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.640]  that entire, we're gonna give them all iPhone stuff
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.040]  and iPad stuff out of the keynote
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.600]  and it would not have changed the event at all.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.080]  Yeah, but I can see why they put that in though.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.800]  It was, it was a way of emphasizing
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.040]  with third-party proof that the anecdote was that,
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.080]  I forget what team it was, if it was the Royals or who,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.040]  but somebody in Major League Baseball
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.120]  had hit like a, you know,
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.760]  like their hundredth career home run
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.800]  and it landed in their own team's bullpen
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.960]  where the relief pitchers warm up over the home run fence.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.240]  So the relief pitchers on the team were in possession
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.680]  of this ball, which the player obviously wanted to have.
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.200]  So the relief pitchers put together a list
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.760]  of here's what we want you to buy us
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.880]  and we'll give you the ball.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.240]  And like everything on the list was an Apple product
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.000]  and a 50 gallon barrel of lube.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:13.880]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.800]  But at a two and almost a two and a half hour keynote,
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.600]  I think again, you start cutting anything you can.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.280]  Well, they showed it, but they also Photoshopped out
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.440]  the 50 gallon barrel of lube,
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.160]  which I understand why they did.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.360]  Cause you know, I understand that they kind of want
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.160]  to keep these things G rated, if not PG.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:40.240]  And the 50 gallon barrel of lube
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.600]  maybe makes it a little bit more BG 13,
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.760]  but good God was that funny.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.360]  Like they kind of took out the funniest part of it.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.200]  I agree.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.600]  I do know, I know what you're talking about though,
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.280]  that if it's already going over two hours,
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.160]  even that you take out,
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.280]  how much do they need to brag about that?
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.120]  Yeah.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.080]  I found it worrisome though.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:58.920]  I do.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.960]  I honestly feel like,
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.680]  I kind of feel like the most worrisome thing
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.280]  as an Apple watcher of the year
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.680]  was not any product in particular,
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.160]  but the WWDC keynote as a whole.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.880]  And that's something only Tim Cook can take control of.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.800]  And unless he wants to take control of that,
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.560]  I don't think we'll see that change.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.560]  Like it was one of the unique things about Steve Jobs.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.480]  And it wasn't the most important thing.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.880]  It was just the most,
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.760]  the thing that we on the outside got to see
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:33.760]  was that he had an innate and uncanny talent as a showman,
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.920]  that he was good.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.080]  Those keynotes were all entirely in his head.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:42.960]  And of course they've always been broken up into segments
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.080]  because that's how you do it.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.920]  But that he had this ability like from,
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.720]  seat to watching,
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.120]  Phil Schiller come out and do the introduction
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.080]  for the new MacBook or PowerBook
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.480]  or whatever it was going back in time.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.640]  And then this,
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.640]  and that he could just close his eyes
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.200]  and just see how this whole thing would play out
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.400]  and feel as a 90 minute show
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.320]  and could figure out things like,
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.160]  you know what,
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:15.720]  let's not introduce this at the end as one more thing.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.800]  Let's move it up front and blow people away
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.440]  right out of the gate.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.800]  You know, and could just see how that would play,
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.760]  you know, a new, which, you know,
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.680]  I think, you know, some of it's arbitrary
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.760]  and you can quibble with it,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.680]  but that he, you know, like a film director
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.280]  could just sort of feel how,
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.400]  you know, whether these scenes are good in and of themselves
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.960]  what do they combine to as a whole as a show?
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.760]  And there was, and combine the showmanship
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.040]  with the absolute unquestioned authority
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.440]  of I don't care who you are,
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.480]  I don't care if you're, you know,
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.040]  senior vice president of whatever,
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.720]  this thing that you wanna get, you know,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.640]  that we've been rehearsing for two weeks
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.080]  and you, you know, want the stage time to do.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.120]  If I've decide the night before the keynote
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.400]  that that whole thing is cut
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.160]  because it just doesn't play right, that's it.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.920]  You know, there's no, you know, tough luck.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.200]  And I kind of feel like,
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.160]  I kind of just feel like that whole Apple, I don't know.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.400]  I just feel like that whole Apple Music intro
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.120]  was that nobody was there with the authority
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.400]  to say, you know what, Eddie, this isn't ready.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  There's very few things.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.440]  Like a lot of people will say
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.000]  this wouldn't happen if Steve Jobs was around
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.680]  and usually that they have no idea
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.640]  what Steve Jobs would have decided at any moment or not.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]  But this is one of those few things
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.240]  where you can look back at the long history
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.000]  of Apple keynotes and see that he had a rhythm and a pace
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.400]  and a delivery and a concept for these things
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.200]  that, you know, was just beyond anyone else in the industry.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.200]  And we're not getting that anymore.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.040]  Yeah.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.480]  Yeah, I really, I hesitate to ever pull that, play that card
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.440]  but I would say that that keynote
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.120]  and the Apple Music segment in particular,
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.560]  that's one of the few where I would say
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.520]  that wouldn't happen if Steve was still around.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.040]  Yeah, well, it's one of the few things
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.800]  where you can do it because he was,
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.680]  there was no one intermediating Steve Jobs and you.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.640]  He was on stage and he was talking to the audience.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.640]  It was incredibly direct.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.160]  So it's not behind the scenes
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.840]  and who was in charge of this and who did that.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.080]  It was Steve Jobs talking to us.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.200]  And I think that's an easy thing to talk about.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.280]  Right, and I've heard it from, you know,
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.800]  people who work at Apple, you know,
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.560]  that Steve was the guy, you know,
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.080]  that he didn't just show up
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.920]  and there wasn't somebody else organizing the show.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.240]  He really was putting the show together.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.960]  And I've also heard it from, you know,
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.640]  like people who worked at third party companies
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.120]  but who were getting, you know,
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.680]  were invited by Apple to, you know,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.760]  come on stage as, you know, you might.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.200]  And it's funny, it's always exactly the same,
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.840]  which is that they get invited to come out,
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.160]  they go into sequester.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.800]  It's like, you're pretty much like locked into like Apple,
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.440]  a very nice prison and you rehearse and rehearse and rehearse
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.440]  and you have no idea whether you're actually gonna be
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.160]  in the keynote until, you know, like the night before.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.000]  And even then, you know, it might be you're in, you're out.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.560]  Yeah, and their events team is absolutely spectacular
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.760]  and they do a fantastic job,
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.640]  but they don't control who's up on stage
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.880]  for how long or saying what,
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.520]  that's become the executive in charge of that thing.
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.800]  And it's no longer just Steve Jobs.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.920]  Right, and I do kind of feel bottom line
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.720]  is that it's sort of effectively a committee now.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.560]  And it might be a small committee, you know,
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.400]  Schiller, Eddie Q, Shirley, Tim Cook, you know,
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.520]  and I think I wouldn't underestimate,
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.240]  even though he's not on stage personally,
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.800]  I wouldn't underestimate Johnny Ives,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.720]  influence on these things, on the events.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.640]  You know, the fact that he does his in prerecorded films
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.600]  is, doesn't make him less involved, I think,
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:44.960]  in the structure of the events.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.400]  Yeah, and even those, those videos used to have faces
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.120]  and then they used to have several people,
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.800]  like Van Rietje would sometimes appear in them.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.160]  Definitely Bob Mansfield in previous years.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.000]  And this year it was just voiceover.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:56.840]  Yeah.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.760]  And it was just Johnny Ive.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.600]  Yeah, more cinematic, less documentary style
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:06.600]  and more, I don't know, like product,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.560]  like more advertising style.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.240]  And to your point about Apple Music being a sloppy product,
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.760]  the thing to me is when they made that announcement,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.600]  when Jimmy Iovine said one single thought around music,
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.000]  and you just start thinking about that
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.560]  from an interface perspective and how many masters
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.960]  that has to, that has to save all,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.600]  like it has to serve all the traditional people,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.800]  like Jim Downer will have 40,000 songs on their hard drive.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.440]  It has to serve people who only want to stream music.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.160]  They had a social network built into there.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.760]  So it has to be accessible.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.000]  And if you put that in a separate app,
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.040]  no one is ever gonna open it by itself.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.920]  And it creates almost an impossible problem to be solved.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.920]  Can I tell you a funny story I heard about Jimmy Iovine?
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.320]  Absolutely.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.360]  This is absolutely positively unverifiable
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.520]  because this is like fourth hand,
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.880]  maybe like a fourth hand story.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.520]  But in terms of the gist of the story
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.640]  is that Jimmy Iovine is from people
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:05.640]  who've had to deal with him within Apple is eye rolling.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.880]  And that at one point when they were talking about
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.160]  what to do with Apple Music,
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.960]  he had tossed out in a meeting the idea
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.440]  that what if we just, what if we get rid of apps?
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.400]  And when you just turn on your iPhone, there's your music.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.400]  And they were like, wouldn't that just be like
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.200]  what the iPod was?
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.000]  And he was like, no, no, it's still your phone.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.320]  And you're on the, you know, you have the internet.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.680]  I mean, but you don't have to worry about apps.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.880]  You just turn on your phone and there's your music.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.280]  Streaming Taylor Swift, the mini turn on your phone.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.680]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:46.600]  I did not hear that from anybody at Apple.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.000]  I heard that from somebody who worked at Apple
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.640]  a long time ago and still has friends at Apple.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.600]  Yeah, I mean, that's the kind of stories where, you know,
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.320]  someone whose job it is isn't to implement,
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.840]  like isn't implement things on the atom or the bit
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.960]  or the pixel level.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.040]  We'll just throw those kinds of things out.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.240]  Turn on your phone and there's your music.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.440]  Punchier.
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.920]  What was the event that Jimmy Iovine came out
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.920]  and was that the WWDC keynote?
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.880]  Yeah, well, he definitely came out during the WWDC keynote.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.280]  And where he said something that seemed like a reference,
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.120]  what was it?
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.760]  He was like a reference back to like a classic Apple moment
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.800]  and people applauded, but he didn't get it.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.400]  And he got confused and like turned around
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.120]  and looked at the slide.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:33.360]  Ah, no, I don't recall.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.200]  Oh, I forget.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.280]  I forget the exact details of it, but it was like,
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.320]  it probably wasn't one more thing,
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.360]  but I can imagine that he was like,
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.400]  if he had said one more thing and everybody like
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.840]  kind of clapped and applauded and he didn't even get
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.120]  that that was something that people who followed Apple
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.200]  for a long time would get.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200]  And so he thought maybe something had gone wrong
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.520]  with the slides and something,
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.680]  a glitch was on the slide behind him.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.480]  And that's why people were laughing to him inexplicably.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.080]  And so he got like, he paused and like turned around
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.400]  and looked at the slide, but the slide was right.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.160]  And then that only served to discombobulate him even further
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:13.600]  because now he had no idea why people were laughing.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.560]  And it was very, very awkward.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.960]  It's always been hard to enculturate people into Apple.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]  And it's especially hard when you're getting
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.800]  this many new people,
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.720]  but when these people come in at executive levels,
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.880]  it's almost impossible.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.880]  So you have someone who's used to working in LA
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.160]  and with Hollywood and with recording studios,
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.520]  and you get them in a meeting with people
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.880]  who've been making shiny boxes all their lives.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.520]  It's gonna be a clash.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.600]  It's, from the outside,
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.640]  it seems like maybe Angela Arens is doing well though.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.560]  I think so.
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.320]  I mean, this 16 minutes was also a bit of her coming out.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.240]  And I always thought,
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.320]  I think we talked about it last year
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.960]  that she, because she was so vocal in her previous gig,
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.240]  that she would be more of a spokesperson for Apple
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.640]  and she would talk about retail more.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.480]  But apparently she's been hard at work behind the scenes,
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.520]  just melding the online and retail operations
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.320]  and getting the new store concepts going.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.160]  It sounds like, it was funny because a couple of weeks ago,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.000]  someone wrote an article saying,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.120]  where's Angela Arens, why she disappeared.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.720]  And people on campus are like,
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.800]  well, we see her all the time.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.120]  I understand the article.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.520]  But I kind of feel like people, there's,
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.600]  and again, I think it fits in with a year in review
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.120]  and talking about these events that this year,
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.200]  there were more women on stage from Apple
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.400]  during these events than ever before.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.800]  And that's a good thing.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.680]  And I don't think it is purely happenstance.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.840]  I think that it's something they're aware of internally.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.440]  I asked Phil Schuler about it on stage
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.120]  on the talk show after WWDC.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.800]  Absolutely, they're aware of it, but it has to be,
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.120]  it's not like we're going to find a woman to do this.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.560]  It's, there have to be, the real problem is that,
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.520]  wasn't that they didn't put women on stage,
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.280]  it's that they didn't have women in positions
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:06.640]  where it was their products doing it, right?
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.160]  And not to make excuses for it,
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.160]  but Apple is an older company and older companies,
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.480]  they've had established people,
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.840]  like Phil Schuler has been there for a long time,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.960]  Eddy Cue, Tim Cook,
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.720]  all these people have been there for decades
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.280]  and they're amongst the best in the world.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.120]  Where a new startup,
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.520]  they would have a much different demographic
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.840]  starting out the gate than Apple would.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.680]  Right, they don't,
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.360]  it's not like they hire show people
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.360]  to present these things on stage at their events.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.880]  The products and services,
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.360]  whatever it is that they're announcing
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.360]  are being presented by the people who are in charge of them
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.600]  and who know them best and who have shepherded them
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.920]  through to existence.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.360]  And so the fact that historically women
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.560]  have been underrepresented on stage at Apple events,
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.800]  isn't, doesn't mean that Apple has a problem
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.480]  picking who gets to go on stage in the event.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.280]  The problem is that they don't have enough women
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.600]  in positions of authority running teams within the company.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.720]  Yeah, or in their executive team most specifically.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.800]  Right, who would therefore be the person
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.960]  to come on stage and do it, you know,
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.880]  and obviously that's changing with Apple Pay.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.880]  Who's that, her name escapes me at the moment.
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.720]  I'm blanking on it too.
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.040]  Yeah, Apple Pay and Apple News.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.320]  Yes, both were represented by women, et cetera.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.320]  So for the people who are saying,
[01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.480]  well, where's Angela Arntz?
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.360]  Well, they're not gonna bring Angela Arntz on stage
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.720]  to talk about a new MacBook or something like that.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:28.640]  It's not just, well,
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.280]  there's a woman on the SVP leadership team,
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.440]  therefore they should have her come out and do something.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.200]  It's only gonna make sense for her to come on stage
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.800]  when there's some kind of retail news
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.840]  that they want to talk about.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.640]  And I think that's inevitable at some point.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.280]  There's going to be something that, you know,
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.120]  happens with retail that they're gonna wanna talk about
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.200]  at one of these events.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.880]  And of course it's gonna be her to talk about it.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.080]  Yeah, retail or fashion.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:57.400]  And those are the things that Tim Cook used to speak about.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.240]  And they unfortunately cut those at the same time
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.400]  they brought Angela Arntz on
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.360]  because Tim Cook doesn't spend time on stage
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.840]  talking about them anymore either.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.680]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:05.840]  Well, I don't know about fashion though.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.480]  Cause fashion it would be too,
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.960]  I guess I could imagine maybe with the watch
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:12.880]  that there would be something to do with the watch
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.360]  as a product that it's relation to the fashion industry.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.960]  It would make sense to have Angela Arntz
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.480]  be the person to do it.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.600]  Because it's also, I think inextricably tied to retail
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.320]  where it's not just Apple's retail, but retail in general
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.320]  and the partnerships that they have with fashion related
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.880]  retailers that aren't the Apple store.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.120]  And it's, you and I know
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.680]  cause we have a lot of mutual friends there
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.840]  but there are phenomenally talented women engineers
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.960]  at Apple and women program managers
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.880]  and designers and developers.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.720]  And those people don't just don't get to talk on keynotes.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.520]  Right, whether the, you know, at any,
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.640]  male, female doesn't even matter.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.720]  That's just not,
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.320]  Apple doesn't run those type of keynotes
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.400]  where it dozens of, you know, mid-level.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.200]  You get an occasional Chris Latner.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.560]  Like, I think that was a huge exception too.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.680]  I don't think anyone like Chris Latner
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.920]  had ever spoken at a keynote before.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.160]  As opposed to the afternoon state of the union keynote.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.440]  Which is, you know, where he's been,
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.600]  he has spoken before and where you would expect it.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.040]  And this year we had the phenomenal woman
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.760]  in charge of clock faces get a tremendous talk
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.320]  at the state of the union this year.
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.480]  I remember that.
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.320]  That was great.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.520]  Anyway, I did think on 60 minutes.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.120]  I've seen Angela Orange speak before,
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.120]  especially after, you know,
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.600]  when she first got hired and they announced it
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.040]  and I was researching into it.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:37.040]  But her stint on the 60 minutes segment did reiterate,
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.360]  you know, boy, she's a remarkably cogent
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.000]  and thoughtful person.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:43.840]  Yeah, no, and I agree.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.680]  But I do think that it's great that Apple is doing this.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.680]  And it's similar to when Tim Cook came out.
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.280]  He said, because, you know, if it was just up to me,
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.280]  I wouldn't because I'm a private person,
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.960]  but it's important to be a role model.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:54.720]  And I think it's important to have diverse people
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.000]  up on stage and super successful positions
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.440]  in super successful companies like Apple
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.680]  to be those role models.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.160]  And you have to give them opportunity.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.240]  Craig Federighi wasn't great, his first WWDC,
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.560]  but he's terrific now.
[01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.240]  And Jeff Williams, two events in, much better presenter.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.960]  And if you give them these opportunities,
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.560]  they could be just as phenomenal.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.760]  And it's a super deep bench.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.120]  Like you have, you know, Greg Joswiak, also phenomenal,
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.160]  who didn't get any time,
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:19.520]  I don't think at all on stage this year.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.480]  But you also have, you know,
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.080]  the woman in charge of iPhone marketing is phenomenal
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.600]  and there will be opportunities when they get stage time
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.560]  and it'll just make, I think,
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.560]  the company better for everybody.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.400]  Yeah.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.320]  What else about it at WWDC?
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.640]  Anything else?
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.680]  Swift 2.0 and I think that's where they announced
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.160]  that it was gonna open source.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.680]  Oh, that is true.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.400]  It is when they announced that it would go open source
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.720]  by the end of the year and they did hit that.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.120]  I don't really have much to say about that.
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.680]  I mean, I think I kind of covered that last week with.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.440]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.920]  Talk about stacking the guest deck.
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:00.560]  I don't think we need to cover Swift on this episode.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.400]  Let's just suffice it to say it was pretty big deal
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.960]  and it seems to be going very, very well.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.800]  Yes.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.800]  Content blockers ended up being another thing
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.400]  that enormous amounts of angst and anxiety
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.800]  and stress was built over.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.760]  And then again, at the end of the year,
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.320]  we're hardly mentioning them.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.320]  Yeah, it doesn't seem to have really changed
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.320]  anything significant.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.160]  I think it's great.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.400]  I enjoy running them.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:31.080]  And I do think that they make for a noticeable improvement,
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.800]  but I don't think that they've bankrupted any
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.920]  or are even on pace to bankrupt any media properties.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.760]  I'm kind of sad about that
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760]  because I thought that was one of,
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.040]  because the industry is just, it's horrible and intransigent
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:42.960]  and that was one of the few things
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.960]  that could scare it out of its complacency.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.440]  And I don't think it's done a good enough job
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.440]  scaring them to their bottom dollars yet.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.000]  Yeah, I feel like there was more talk about that
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:54.960]  when they were, when it was first come out
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:57.920]  and, or actually right before they came out really,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:01.520]  when people thought, good God, a week from now,
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.680]  70% of our mobile is gonna disappear.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.520]  Yes.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:10.720]  But in hindsight, there was like a day or two
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.880]  where the app store charts were dominated
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.880]  by content blockers and then not so much.
[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:20.320]  Yeah.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.280]  Hopefully next year that'll spike again.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.120]  So what about the summer?
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.400]  Anything over the summer?
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.240]  I don't think so.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.080]  There was some interesting stuff
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.000]  like the out of nowhere and iPod touch six
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.440]  finally came out, a modern iPod touch.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.240]  Oh, that is true.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.920]  That was like July, right?
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.640]  It was like the middle of July.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:45.480]  Yeah, it didn't really do.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.000]  I mean, it was exact same design.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.800]  It did have a modern A7 processor.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.960]  So it's 64 bit.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.640]  And that was about all that that came with it.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.240]  There was some new iPod colors as well
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:58.080]  but the iPod line didn't change at all.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:58.920]  No.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.200]  Do you think that the,
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.920]  do you think that this might be it for the iPod touch?
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.680]  I think it's getting,
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.280]  I think the pressure from the iPhones
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.160]  being more and more available and affordable
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.080]  and the iPad mini being as popular as it is
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.840]  kind of squeezes out the iPod touch in many ways.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.680]  It's still the cheapest,
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.000]  absolute cheapest way to get to the app store.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.320]  But I think the app store now is a proven value
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:22.640]  and people are willing to pay a little bit more
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.160]  to get into it in order to get more functionality from it.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.640]  I was surprised by,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:31.960]  I think I've seen this from a few other places too
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.720]  but like when I think it was United
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.920]  or one of these airlines was like,
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.680]  we're gonna buy 10,000 iPhones
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.720]  and give them to all of our gate agents
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.440]  and flight attendants and et cetera.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.880]  That they weren't iPod touches.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.560]  That it seems to me like it would make more sense
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.920]  for that to be an iPod touch, lower price.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.600]  Let's presume that there's some kind of workable Wi-Fi
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.080]  in the airport that they can use.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:00.800]  That they wouldn't need to be a full,
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.480]  why would you spend the extra money,
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:05.080]  hundreds of extra dollars per unit for the phone
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.080]  when it doesn't really make sense for them to be phone
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.360]  if they're just using them for that?
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.760]  But that's what they're using the phone.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.280]  Yeah, and it's probably a greater dynamic
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.520]  where you have sort of existing carrier relationships
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.640]  with enterprise companies
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:19.280]  and they're buying them in the thousands.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.320]  And if people are still wondering
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.880]  why they're 16 gigabyte iPhones,
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.600]  that's one of the big reasons is institutional buyers.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.880]  So it's almost like they just move from Blackberry to iPhone
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.240]  or to something else.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.840]  But it wasn't, I don't know, to me it was.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:36.760]  And they're sort of like web portals.
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.320]  All they do is access web portals
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.880]  or business to B2B apps.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.520]  So they need almost nothing but a web connection.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.680]  Yeah.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.520]  Ooh, her name just popped into my head.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.800]  Jennifer Bailey.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.640]  Yes.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.600]  It was killing me.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.880]  Jennifer Bailey is the Apple executive
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:55.840]  who runs Apple Pay under EdiQ.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:56.920]  Yes.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.760]  Anything else in the summer?
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.120]  A whole bunch of other stuff I think.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.280]  Yeah.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.680]  But she was the one who was on stage at least.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.040]  No, I think there was a minor stuff
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:05.960]  like Apple killed one-to-one,
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.680]  but very little else happened
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.720]  until the monstrous event in September.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.560]  Right.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.400]  So before we get to that,
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.320]  let's thank our next sponsor
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.400]  and it's our good friends at Hullo, H-U-L-L-O.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.120]  Hullo makes pillows, literally.
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.320]  I mean, this is the product
[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.600]  that I'm here to tell you about.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  It is a pillow.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:29.400]  Have you ever tried a buckwheat hole, H-U-L-L, pillow?
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.880]  This is a style of pillow
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.480]  that has been popular for centuries throughout Asia.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.600]  It's the best way to describe it
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.280]  is that it's sort of like a beanbag pillow.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.120]  You can feel them.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.120]  They're almost like they feel like
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:45.760]  maybe like small coffee beans inside the pillow.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.360]  Definitely, if you pick one up and shake it,
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.680]  you can hear it.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.320]  It feels like something full of beans,
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.560]  but they're not really beans.
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.000]  They're buckwheat holes.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.000]  Why would you wanna do this?
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:56.840]  It sounds crazy,
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.160]  especially if all you've ever done
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.440]  is sleep on a traditional feather style
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.600]  or artificial or real feather, whatever,
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.160]  but that's similar sort of puffy type pillow.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.120]  A buckwheat hole pillow conforms to your body
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.320]  and provides cool, comfortable support.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:15.080]  Air breathes through it in a way that it can't.
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:16.880]  It flows freely through this
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.680]  in a way that keeps you cool all night long.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.520]  You don't get sweaty.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:21.400]  Your head doesn't get hot on the pillow.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.680]  It's super easy to adjust.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.240]  You buy one of these things
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.840]  and if you think it's too thick out of the box,
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.200]  all you do is just unzip it
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.560]  and remove some of the holes at any time.
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.680]  It's really totally clean.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.520]  It's just a bunch of these beans that you take out.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.040]  So you can adjust it at any time.
[01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.520]  Very, very easy.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.880]  It's made in the USA
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.760]  with quality construction and materials.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.080]  I've had one, I think for over a year now.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.680]  My wife and I both have them
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.000]  and it definitely is different.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.040]  Definitely is not like it's a different style of pillow,
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.560]  but once we got used to it,
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:30:59.440]  which didn't take long,
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:00.760]  it really does.
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:02.640]  I like it a lot.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.480]  I really do.
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.640]  It's a pre-shrunken durable twill cotton case,
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:11.080]  has a high quality Dunlap hidden zipper
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:15.920]  and the buckwheat hole fill is grown and milled
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.640]  in North Dakota, right here in the United States.
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.880]  It's an environmentally friendly and organic product.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.320]  No chemical based foams or feathers
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:25.280]  or anything like that in there.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.280]  Just 100% unbleached certified cotton on the outside
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.880]  and these buckwheat holes on the inside.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.400]  So they have different sizes,
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.560]  starting small is 50 bucks,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.280]  standard size, $79,
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.120]  king size, $129.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:49.000]  You can save money though by buying more than one
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.960]  and they have a special URL
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.200]  just for listeners of the show.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:58.200]  It's hello pillow, H-U-L-L-O-P-I-L-L-O-W.com
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.200]  slash talk show.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.720]  And last but not least, 1% of all of their company profits
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.160]  are contributed to The Nature Conservancy.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.240]  So if you're in the market for a new pillow,
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:12.080]  give them a shot.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.160]  Give Hello Pillow a shot.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.160]  Really, really interesting.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.000]  Very different.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.840]  And hello pillow.com slash talk show.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.840]  No the, that's the URL.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.520]  All right, September.
[01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:26.000]  Yeah.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.760]  Boy, I feel like maybe we should have started with this
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.280]  because it's, it was a big event.
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.080]  Well, they only did one fall event this year,
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.000]  so they put everything into it.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:35.840]  Yeah.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:40.200]  I, in hindsight, you know,
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.160]  I feel like that's probably smart.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.200]  And I feel like the other thing too
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.680]  is to go circle back to what I said about WWDC.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:49.520]  I feel like they
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.800]  clarified the messaging
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.040]  and the coherency of the event significantly.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.240]  I can't help but suspect that internally
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.760]  they recognized that the WWDC keynote
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.800]  was not up to their own standards.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.080]  And the September event might've been even extra sharp
[01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:09.920]  because of it.
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.840]  Yeah, it was for everything that they covered
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:13.880]  and it was so big,
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.240]  they didn't even have time to cover OS X or the Mac.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.720]  They managed to get it done in,
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:20.520]  I think four well put together segments.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.360]  Yeah.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:22.200]  I mean, and you know,
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.680]  if we're gonna look back at the year,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.680]  I mean, you know, easily the biggest mistake I published
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.920]  on Daring Fireball was the night before the event
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.320]  predicting that there's no way
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.920]  they're gonna have only one event for the fall.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.200]  Well, it hadn't before.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.480]  It had been iPhone and iPods or something else in September
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.320]  and then Mac and iPad in October.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.160]  Yeah.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.760]  I think two years or three years before that.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.800]  But this year they had no new Mac.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.440]  They had the 4K iMac,
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.200]  but they sort of showed that off already
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.400]  with the 5K iMac the year before.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:57.440]  Well, I think if they wanted to, they could have.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.480]  I think the easiest way that they could have done it
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.200]  would be to hold the iPad Pro for October
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.680]  and have a separate event just for the iPad Pro
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.760]  and then to fill out the event demo El Capitan
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.280]  and boom, there you go.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.000]  There's a little smaller event in October
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.440]  and it wasn't ready to ship anyway.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.240]  So it wouldn't have even delayed the shipping
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.680]  of the iPad Pro.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.720]  Although they wanted to get El Cap out earlier this year,
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.640]  I think it shipped on September 30th,
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.560]  which would have pulled it out of that event.
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.280]  Yeah, but it would have been fine
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.600]  if they would have held the El Capitan.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:28.000]  It wouldn't have if they wanted to.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.680]  I think it's just that they didn't want to.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.760]  But it wasn't just my argument
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.440]  that I don't think they're gonna have just one event.
[01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.000]  It wasn't just that they have had two events for years.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.400]  It was that if they only have one event,
[01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.640]  there's no way they're gonna cover all this stuff.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.760]  And some of these things are gonna have to be cut.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.200]  And so I was right about that,
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.360]  that some of these things would have to be cut
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.960]  and they would go through the fall
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.880]  without even re-demo-ing the tent pole features
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.560]  of El Capitan on stage.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.800]  I was just wrong that they might be willing to do that.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:57.640]  But I think that's a good-
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.480]  They had a release date
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.480]  in the sidebar of the email in the slide
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.960]  on the stage.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.800]  Right, this is how little time El Cap got on that event,
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  that when they announced the shipping date,
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:11.040]  it was a screenshot of,
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.680]  I think it was for the iPad Pro, right?
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:14.960]  Yeah, it was the mail app.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:17.280]  And you can see it was a mail from Phil in the song.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.080]  I was like, Phil, yeah, like Phil,
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.840]  it was like an email from Phil Shielder to Federighi
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.960]  or somebody saying like,
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.720]  yeah, El Cap ship date will be September 30th.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.680]  Top secret, don't tell anyone.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.320]  And it was just in the screenshot to the mail client.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.160]  Yeah.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:35.960]  And then very quickly,
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:37.120]  they had to get that up on apple.com,
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.400]  so otherwise it would have been pandemonium
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.840]  with everyone calling to see if that was serious or not.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.760]  Right, was it a joke or was it not?
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.720]  We sat together for that one, right?
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.920]  It was me and you and Clayton Morris, right?
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.760]  Yes.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.240]  I remember when that came up
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.680]  and we were whispering with each other,
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.920]  like, was that real, did I see that?
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.400]  Do you think that's what they mean?
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.720]  Yeah, it was.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.160]  I mean, it started off with Jeff Williams and the watch.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:03.200]  And it's interesting
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.640]  because they showed off new watch bands
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.000]  that, you know, Johnny and I have had shown off,
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.840]  I think at a Paris show, fashion show earlier in the year.
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:12.680]  And then they announced Apple Watch Hermes.
[01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:15.700]  I guess the first real example of Apple partnering
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.680]  with a fashion shop outside of their own,
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.560]  which was super interesting to me.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.820]  Yeah, I think so too.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:27.080]  It makes me wonder about, you know,
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.440]  future things like the car and stuff like that.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.160]  And will there be, and, you know, again,
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.800]  wouldn't it would be interesting
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.280]  even if it wasn't like to partner
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.640]  with an existing car company,
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.200]  but again, like maybe to partner with Hermes
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.520]  and have like a car come out with an Hermes designed interior
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.240]  or something like that.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.480]  Yeah, I mean, again,
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.540]  they're gonna wanna have products that are introductory.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.380]  They get people in the door.
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:50.540]  They're gonna have the product
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:51.560]  that most people end up buying,
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.080]  which is usually the middle of the road product.
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.760]  And they're gonna wanna have premium products,
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.200]  people who want the absolute best.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.360]  And when you get to things like cars and watches
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:59.400]  with the absolute best,
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.920]  it isn't just about speeds and feeds.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.760]  Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.380]  I wonder, this had never really occurred to me before,
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:09.200]  but in the way that they, for things like the car,
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.180]  they have to be thinking in the scope of a decade, right?
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.200]  That this thing got started at least three, four,
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.760]  five years ago, maybe even more.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.760]  And it's probably at least three, four, five years away
[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.200]  from coming to market.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.480]  That this is something that they've had to think
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:29.840]  in a decade long window for.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.760]  And in terms of what you and I talked about
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.480]  earlier in the show about what was the point
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.080]  of the gold Apple watch edition models
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.840]  and going through all this
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.360]  and selling these things at these high prices
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.520]  for something that was gonna sell in such low quantities.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.760]  I wonder if part of it isn't getting,
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.080]  rehearsing sort of going through
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.080]  the bifurcated levels of product
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.060]  based on significantly different orders of magnitude,
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:08.640]  different prices and partnering with companies
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.520]  and creating truly luxurious materials,
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.560]  using truly luxurious materials to separate these segments.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.900]  Not so much for the watch itself, but for the eventual car.
[01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:26.480]  Because in the car, it's going to be significantly
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.960]  more money and way more important that there are,
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.280]  maybe, maybe, who knows?
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:33.240]  Maybe the car will come out and there's one model
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.560]  and it's $25,000 and that's it.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.760]  But somehow I don't think so.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:38.600]  Yeah, no, absolutely.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.160]  And that's why I think segmentation, again,
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.700]  was so important for Apple this year,
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:45.180]  because as you get into, as you become a certain size,
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:48.400]  your growth becomes limited and you have to start segmenting
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.240]  and as you get into other product lines,
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.080]  you can't just assume that they work the same way
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.880]  that your existing product lines do.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.080]  Apple has been very canny about avoiding the pitfalls
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.000]  that have hit a lot of other technology companies.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.360]  And part of the reason is that they sort of think
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.720]  through these things, they pick something,
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:03.680]  they focus on it and they experiment
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:05.600]  in a myriad of different ways,
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.100]  including a lot of prototyping,
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:08.840]  but also a lot of things like,
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.760]  maybe like doing Apple Watch from Azure edition
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:11.680]  or things like that.
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:13.560]  So that when they get into things like watches
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.040]  and things like cars,
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:17.040]  they're not presenting them the way they present
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:17.880]  an iPod shuffle.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:20.700]  They're presenting them within the context of that product.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.720]  I did think, I do think it was interesting too,
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.000]  that by September, you just mentioned,
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.600]  you mentioned this a minute or two ago,
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  that just, it was a year after Apple Watch
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:39.100]  was initially unveiled, but it was really just
[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.980]  May, June, July, August.
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.380]  So five months after it actually hit market
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.780]  where they had all new bands and straps
[01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:50.700]  and didn't just add new bands and straps,
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:52.860]  but actually replaced some of the earlier colors.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:56.700]  So some of the pastels colored sport bands with,
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:03.100]  to my eyes, a much more attractive overall lineup of colors.
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:06.500]  And watchOS 2, it shipped five months after watchOS 1,
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.260]  which is very fast, even in Apple's usual product rollouts.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:16.260]  Yeah, I'm more intrigued by the hardware differences
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.820]  in the bands than the OS,
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:22.660]  because I kind of feel like watchOS 2,
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:27.660]  calling it a 2.0 is a little marketing-y.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:31.020]  It's really sort of, it was to me closer to,
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:34.020]  here's the watchOS we really had wanted to ship originally.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:35.460]  Absolutely, it was around,
[01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.700]  it filled in all the little gaps
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.340]  that were obviously missing from the first one.
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:39.780]  Right, and there's a big difference, obviously,
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.260]  with the native apps, third-party native apps
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:43.620]  being able to run right on a watch
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.180]  as opposed to just being projected on the watch
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:50.000]  from your phone, like the original watch kit apps.
[01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.860]  But other than that, it's really hard to point to anything
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:57.640]  in watchOS 2.0 that was really a 2.0 feature.
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:40:59.580]  Yeah, it's interesting though,
[01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:02.380]  in that it was decoupled, they've sort of decoupled it.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:03.660]  You didn't have to wait for a new watch
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:05.540]  to get watchOS 2.0, they were willing to use
[01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:10.540]  that sort of marketing lingo with mid-cycle almost.
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:11.900]  It just shows that the watch is a very,
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:13.240]  they're treating the watch as a very different
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.620]  sort of product than they have the phones previously.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:18.620]  Yeah, I almost feel like, again,
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:21.700]  part of it is that they've gone through the iPhone
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.800]  to iPhone 3G transition within the first year
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.800]  as opposed to waiting an entire year for it.
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.640]  What was the other thing?
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.220]  Oh, and the fact that so many, it's not even,
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.780]  you don't even have to conjecture,
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:38.060]  it's not like speculation or rumor
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:41.700]  that some of the features, a lot of the features in watchOS 2.0
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:44.860]  were originally meant for watchOS 1.0
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:47.420]  because they showed them a year ago
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:49.320]  at the original watch event,
[01:41:50.260 --> 01:41:53.060]  things like the additional watch faces,
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:55.940]  like the, hey, pick your own, choose your own photo
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.260]  from your photo library and have that as your watch face.
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:01.300]  They showed that in 2014 and it wasn't there
[01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.820]  when it shipped in 2015.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.380]  And some of the faces had the time travel already in them.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:07.940]  Yeah, so like all the stuff that we saw
[01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.260]  was just logical completions of the things
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:12.220]  that had been set up in the first version.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:14.980]  Right, it almost, the fact that time travel
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:18.100]  wasn't there originally, almost it defeated
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:21.140]  the existence of the crown.
[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:21.980]  Yes.
[01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:25.140]  The crown was meant to be there for that sort of,
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:26.620]  here, if you wanna see where you're gonna be
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.580]  later in the afternoon, just look at your watch
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.840]  and spin the crown.
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:32.300]  And to your earlier point,
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.340]  they were not capable of getting it ready in that point,
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:36.820]  so should they have waited until September to release it?
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:38.180]  No, it was nice to get it out early
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:40.660]  and they can add those things as they're going.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.340]  Yeah, the other thing that I wanna talk about on that
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.460]  is the rumors, and I don't doubt them,
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:52.140]  but that optimistically they had hoped to ship the watch
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.820]  a year ago, by the end of 2014.
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:59.940]  And maybe you just need to have a goal like that
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:02.940]  to get it so that it does ship in early 2015.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:05.420]  But I feel like for these new products
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:09.500]  where they have these, I mean, just compare the pencil,
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:13.560]  which is less of a, at least at this point,
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:15.620]  clearly not as big a deal as the watch.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:17.860]  But the fact that here we are going into the holidays
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:20.460]  and somebody who at December 14th was like,
[01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.460]  ooh, I know, I wanna get one more present
[01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:25.220]  for my significant other, I'll get him an Apple Pencil.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:29.580]  Couldn't do it in time, but with the watch you could,
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:33.460]  because the watch got those kinks out of the operational
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:37.580]  and the manufacturing system in the first half of the year,
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:41.780]  rather than unveiling in the fourth quarter.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.140]  Absolutely, and it's worse for Apple
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.980]  because they lose the sales on those keyboards
[01:43:44.980 --> 01:43:48.180]  and on those pencils that just aren't on the shelves.
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:50.020]  Yeah, you can't, that's,
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:55.780]  I just feel like it's so much easier to sell,
[01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.740]  well, what the hell, I'll just get the pencil
[01:43:57.740 --> 01:43:59.740]  and the expensive smart keyboard
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:04.340]  while I'm buying this $1,100 iPad than later on.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.980]  There's no doubt in my mind that they,
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:07.820]  if they had full availability on those,
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.940]  they would have sold more of them than they will,
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:13.660]  because some number of people who did buy the iPad Pro
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:16.660]  and when they bought it, wanted to buy the pencil,
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:19.660]  maybe will never get back around to buying it.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:20.500]  Even when-
[01:44:20.500 --> 01:44:21.660]  And we've all heard stories about the original,
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:24.380]  like the golden path on the original iPhone
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.340]  that Steve Jobs demonstrated in 2007,
[01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:27.980]  how he had to stick to it or the entire thing
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:29.380]  would have just collapsed on,
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:31.900]  like getting those first products out is extremely hard
[01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:34.580]  and who knows what the internal dates are for these things,
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:37.220]  but they get them out as soon as they can.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.700]  It was like, you had to,
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:40.380]  it was something to the effect of like,
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:43.780]  he had to demo Safari and load the New York Times webpage
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.660]  first and then go to mail.
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:46.980]  And if he had gone to mail first
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.220]  and then tried to load Safari,
[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.580]  like it wouldn't have been enough RAM
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.820]  and it wouldn't, you know,
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.100]  full webpage wouldn't have loaded
[01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:54.580]  or something like, you know, to that effect.
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.500]  You had to do every one of those things in the right order.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.420]  Yeah, and a lot of the stuff comes in hot now
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:01.020]  and whether that's because they're doing too much
[01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.900]  or because they're on certain schedules,
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:03.860]  it's hard to say,
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:06.180]  but they do run absolutely as fast as they can
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:10.420]  to get that stuff out.
[01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.540]  What else was in September?
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:15.380]  So there was Apple TV, new Apple TV, iPad Pro, the Pencil.
[01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:17.060]  The Apple TV was really strange for me
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.780]  because the Apple TV,
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:23.540]  they haven't shipped one previously since 2012, March, 2012.
[01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.140]  And they'd worked on a bunch of different ones.
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:27.220]  They'd worked on set top boxes on like recording box.
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:28.820]  I think like just a whole different,
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:31.500]  the strategy for that Apple TV just kept changing
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.820]  and they just didn't ship anything.
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.700]  And finally, they sort of settled on this box,
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.940]  which is all I ever wanted from them,
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:38.220]  was just a better Apple TV that ran apps.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.460]  But because it took them so long to settle on it,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.940]  that product also came in hot
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:44.580]  and didn't have things like Siri for Apple Music,
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.340]  didn't have finished versions of the apps on it,
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.300]  didn't even get the podcast app out.
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:51.540]  So that to me was almost like a very strange,
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:54.620]  maybe the strangest release for Apple in a long time.
[01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.660]  Yeah, especially given all of the,
[01:45:57.700 --> 01:45:59.780]  to me at least,
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:03.820]  it's a really strong rumors that it was heading into WWDC
[01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.500]  that it was gonna be announced then.
[01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:09.300]  And of course, we just said how long WWDC was.
[01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:10.980]  There wasn't room for it.
[01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.300]  But if there was any sort of thought in anybody's head
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.420]  that, well, maybe Apple TV just got cut from WWDC
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:18.540]  just because of time.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.500]  I think the fact that it was as hard for them
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.900]  to get it out by the end of 2015 as it was
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:26.140]  shows that no, it just wasn't ready at the time.
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:27.460]  Yeah, and again, spectacular team,
[01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:28.900]  super smart people working on it.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:31.340]  But I don't think a clear product direction
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:34.260]  was set for it early enough in the development cycle.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.620]  Yeah, I'm liking mine a lot.
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:40.220]  I really like it.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.180]  I like my old Apple TV.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.180]  And most of the time that I'm watching TV
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:46.420]  is spent using Apple TV.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:47.260]  Likewise.
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:51.980]  But I find as it settles in,
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:55.420]  and now it doesn't feel like the new Apple TV to me anymore.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:57.780]  It feels just like this is Apple TV.
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:46:59.420]  I really like it a lot.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:01.460]  I feel like there's still some fine tuning
[01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:05.020]  to be done on the touchpad sensitivity.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.900]  But it's, I like it a lot.
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.780]  I really, really do.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:14.540]  And I cut the cable cord several years ago
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:16.700]  and it's the only thing that's connected to my TV now.
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.060]  And I watched it almost all day, every day.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:21.100]  And my favorite thing about it is that
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.660]  a lot of it can be updated server side.
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:25.700]  So like the TV app shipped and it really wasn't finished.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.460]  It didn't do everything that the original TV app did.
[01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:29.500]  But over time you can see it.
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.620]  Like they used to sort the order of the shows
[01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:34.300]  based on what you purchased.
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:36.340]  Even if it was an old show that would never be updated,
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:38.060]  it would sit on top and new episodes
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:39.140]  are coming into other shows
[01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:40.460]  and you wouldn't be able to find them.
[01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:41.660]  And now they fixed all that.
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:43.620]  So it kind of sorts based on recent episodes
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:45.980]  and they've added the Siri for Apple music
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:48.900]  and they're fixing a lot of it as it goes.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.900]  And it probably has, it's the best example.
[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:51.820]  I know it's also an iOS,
[01:47:51.820 --> 01:47:54.460]  but it's the best example of my favorite feature this year,
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.660]  which is last year or the year before it was extensibility.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.980]  And this year it's the on-demand resources
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:01.660]  where they've got this whole philosophy now
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:04.140]  of all the stuff you use all the time frequently
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.900]  and all the new stuff is gonna be right there available
[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:09.180]  on the flash chip super fast.
[01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.340]  And the stuff you don't use,
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:11.500]  we're gonna keep up on the cloud
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:13.180]  and then bring it down to you when you need it.
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:14.900]  So effectively you have this,
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:17.860]  you have the server side cloud worth of all this content,
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:20.420]  but it doesn't slow down your machine when you're using it.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:23.620]  Not like my PS3, which I think took four hours of updates
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.460]  every time I turned it on.
[01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:30.460]  I wonder how well games are doing.
[01:48:31.220 --> 01:48:35.580]  The app store for Apple TV is, I would call it vibrant.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:36.860]  And every time I take a look at it,
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.300]  there's definitely new stuff.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:42.500]  And so there's, they absolutely have activity on it.
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.620]  But are people actually using them?
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:51.140]  I would say, I have to say just to compare and contrast,
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.820]  I would say with the watch,
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:55.740]  they absolutely got developers to develop for it.
[01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:59.780]  But I don't think many people are using third-party apps
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:02.260]  on their watch with much frequency.
[01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:03.100]  No, I agree.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.180]  It just isn't a great platform for that yet.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.820]  It's too slow and it's too limited.
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.420]  Arguably, maybe it won't be the same kind of app platform
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.380]  that the phone is when they figure it out.
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.060]  That might, they may well be.
[01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.580]  And it doesn't necessarily mean that the watch itself
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.980]  as a long-term device isn't useful or successful.
[01:49:19.980 --> 01:49:23.220]  It just may mean that apps aren't a big part of that.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.540]  With the Apple TV, I think the potential is clearly there,
[01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:29.460]  you know, for gaming and whatever else.
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.940]  But it's hard to tell.
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:34.900]  I don't know how to gauge that from our perspective.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:35.860]  There's some hard stuff there.
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:38.540]  Like they don't include a bundled game pad in it.
[01:49:38.540 --> 01:49:39.940]  You have to get a third-party game pad.
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.420]  And because of that, they changed their minds
[01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.020]  on whether you had to support,
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.220]  whether you could just offer exclusive game pad games.
[01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:46.620]  Originally you could, but then they said, no,
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:48.660]  you also had to support the Siri remote,
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:50.500]  which led to some gaming compromises.
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:52.420]  And as fantastic as I think ODR is,
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.940]  a lot of things just don't support it yet.
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:56.380]  Like I don't know if Unity or Unreal support it yet,
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:58.340]  which means people can't just take their existing games
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.820]  and dump them on Apple TV.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.900]  There's a lot of work involved in getting them to do that
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:03.780]  sort of quick staging for the download
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.340]  and then downloading the additional resources.
[01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.220]  ODR meaning the on-demand resources.
[01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:09.180]  On-demand resources, yeah, I apologize.
[01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:10.860]  Yeah, so it's just a way of staging apps.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:13.340]  Like the idea of ODR is that you never want someone
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.620]  on their TV to hit a button and say,
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.740]  storage is full, please delete something.
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:18.780]  Cause that's a horrible experience on a console.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.860]  So you want it to intelligently manage all that stuff.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.700]  But the drawback is it has to download a really small file
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.260]  in the beginning to see how much space there is
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.060]  and how much else it has to pull down.
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:28.740]  And that means that on the developer side,
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.780]  they have to go through and slice up their app essentially,
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.460]  so that it can deliver itself in chunks.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.300]  And that's new.
[01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.660]  It's not just taking your existing game
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.260]  and dumping it on the Apple TV.
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:40.660]  Yeah, Jonas just ran into that with the PS4
[01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.780]  we have in the house where he got,
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:45.060]  and it's funny because it was,
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:50.060]  he got a couple of games from family members,
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.980]  you know, outside the family, you know,
[01:50:52.980 --> 01:50:55.700]  like Amy's mom got him two PlayStation games
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:57.100]  and got them on disc.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:51:00.140]  And I understand like as a gift, why that's better,
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.940]  you know, that it's an actual thing you can unwrap
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.020]  and there's a tangibleness to it.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.700]  But I was thinking in the back of my head,
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:07.900]  that's sort of a pain in the ass.
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:10.100]  Like I kind of, you know, I'm kind of all,
[01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:12.580]  I'm kind of done with putting discs in the machines
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:17.580]  to watch movies or play games and he was happy about it.
[01:51:18.660 --> 01:51:19.700]  And I was like, oh, why?
[01:51:19.700 --> 01:51:23.020]  And he goes, well, you know, the PlayStation's getting full.
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.980]  And in fact, when he went to play the one,
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:30.060]  he actually for the first time ran into,
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.180]  even though the game was given to him on disc,
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:34.140]  it actually generated,
[01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.980]  you've got to make room on your PlayStation
[01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.580]  because it didn't even have enough space
[01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:42.220]  to download the patches for the game on disc.
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:43.260]  And it wasn't a huge issue.
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.860]  I mean, we just, you know, figured out
[01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:49.420]  just a handful of games that he hasn't played recently,
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:52.340]  he could get rid of, you know, ones that he had downloaded
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:54.980]  and make plenty of room on the,
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:57.060]  I think it has like a 400 gigabyte drive.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.980]  Didn't take much, but like you said,
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:01.020]  it's not a good experience.
[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:04.140]  And I kind of feel like long-term,
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.420]  again, you know, think about this as we go down the road
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.100]  and like you said, like, well, maybe some of the,
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:12.460]  you know, like Unity and some of these big gaming things
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:14.500]  don't support ODR yet.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:20.460]  It's not as important that they support it now
[01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:21.940]  is that they support it eventually.
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:23.260]  And within two or three years,
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:26.140]  if everybody does Apple and, you know,
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:29.660]  give Apple TV another two or three years of,
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:32.820]  you know, Johnny Cerucci's team's magic.
[01:52:32.820 --> 01:52:33.660]  And I'm not even making, you know,
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:35.260]  and I don't want to go down the whole path
[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:38.340]  of what's the point where Apple TV
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:40.300]  is technically competitive
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:42.700]  with the dedicated gaming consoles.
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:45.140]  Or a Mac mini for that matter.
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.180]  Right, but I think, you know, it's narrowing the gap.
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:49.260]  And I think it's the sort of thing
[01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:50.780]  where maybe it'll never pass it,
[01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:53.620]  but the gap will continue to get narrower and narrower
[01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:56.220]  and therefore eventually will be good enough.
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:58.740]  Whether it's, you know,
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.660]  how good it is as gaming platform now matters,
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.620]  but how good it's going to be overall
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:06.700]  over the next three, four or five years is more important.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:09.820]  And getting ODR support eventually
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:12.300]  within the next year or two could make a big difference,
[01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.180]  you know, three or four years from now.
[01:53:14.180 --> 01:53:16.140]  Yeah, it's clearly a part of Apple's long-term strategy
[01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:17.220]  because Apple Music,
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.100]  it's called Nearline in database parlance.
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:22.580]  It's basically you prioritize frequently accessed
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:26.140]  and new data over infrequently accessed and older data.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:27.340]  And they do it for Apple Music.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:28.900]  They do it for iCloud Photo Library,
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.500]  everything that they're building towards
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.780]  an entire environment that sort of abstracts away storage.
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:36.020]  So you never have to get that little pop-up saying
[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:36.860]  you're out of room.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.100]  It'll just intelligently, almost like a fusion drive,
[01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:42.060]  it'll just intelligently manage your storage back and forth.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.980]  But the compromises in general are super interesting.
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:45.740]  Like they went with 10, 100 base T
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:47.700]  instead of gigabit on the Apple TV.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:49.580]  And it's sort of, why would they do that?
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.140]  But then it turns out that gigabit,
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:53.740]  because of the speed, it'll spike a CPU
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:55.100]  and could result in dropped frames
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.300]  on something that's trying to do 60 frames per second,
[01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.020]  1080p video or gaming.
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.020]  So they went with a more conservative chip set
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:02.660]  because the video they're streaming is not that big.
[01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:03.980]  So they don't need that bandwidth
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:06.180]  and this gives them a much better control over
[01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.300]  how much load hits the processor.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:10.580]  And they didn't go with 4K because 4K,
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:12.100]  it's not a lot of penetration yet
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:13.980]  and HDR might be coming to 4K.
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:17.340]  So making this box, it upsets a lot of people,
[01:54:17.340 --> 01:54:19.020]  but at the same time they made a lot of
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:21.300]  sort of smart decisions the way they make with the camera
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.060]  and with other aspects of their products.
[01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.620]  Yeah, and I also think that they're designing
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:31.380]  for the mainstream in a,
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.700]  let's keep this as simple as possible.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.740]  And the truth is very few people,
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:37.700]  if I had to guess,
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:39.700]  very few people are hooking their Apple TV
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:41.380]  up to ethernet, period.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:43.060]  It's Wi-Fi all the way.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:46.300]  Yeah, and 802.11ac is better for that
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.100]  because I still plug mine in
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:50.900]  because I just don't trust Wi-Fi connections for anything.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.860]  I get super annoyed when it stops in buffers
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.140]  or drops a signal or I have to reboot the router.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.940]  But for those people, 802.11ac is way more important
[01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.220]  to have a stable Wi-Fi connection
[01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:00.900]  than to have a faster ethernet connection.
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:02.460]  Because you notice the problems with Wi-Fi
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.980]  much more than you would with ethernet.
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.980]  Yeah, but you're not the typical person.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.820]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:08.940]  It would be an interesting thing.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.340]  What do you think the percentage of people,
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:14.260]  of all the people who've already bought the new Apple TV,
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:20.620]  what percentage do you think are on Wi-Fi and ethernet?
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:24.580]  I would bet at least 95% are Wi-Fi.
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:25.940]  You know, and Apple,
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.900]  I think you and I were both talking about this at the event.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.500]  Apple has great numbers and all this stuff.
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.700]  Even if we don't always have them,
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:32.460]  like there's no Bluetooth keyboard support,
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.220]  but it turns out like 2% of people use Bluetooth keyboard
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:36.620]  and they're all developers.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:37.460]  Right.
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:38.740]  So it wasn't on their priority list.
[01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:40.540]  Right, so we complained like hell about it
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:43.780]  because we knew that when you hook up a new Apple TV,
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:45.460]  you can just take a, you know,
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.020]  find a Bluetooth keyboard nearby
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.180]  and then you can enter all your passwords conveniently.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:50.020]  And so-
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.020]  Or the MacBook One that we completely forgot
[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:51.860]  to talk about too.
[01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:53.420]  Like there's not a lot of ports,
[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:55.180]  but almost nobody connects their MacBook
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:56.020]  to an external display.
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.460]  It's like 4% of people or something, but it's all of us.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.580]  Yeah.
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.140]  I did forget about the MacBook One.
[01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:01.980]  I did too.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.900]  It's just such a busy year.
[01:56:02.900 --> 01:56:03.740]  What was that?
[01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.620]  That was March, right?
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:06.220]  Yeah.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.220]  At the same event where the Apple Watch was reentered.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.740]  Yes, and research kit, yeah.
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:15.900]  Well, hold the thought on that
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:18.060]  because I'll tie that into something else.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:23.060]  And, well, that's where we were talking about Apple TV.
[01:56:25.940 --> 01:56:27.300]  I would say with games,
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.420]  I don't know if it's a hit yet or not.
[01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:31.300]  I kind of feel like they made a mistake
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:36.300]  by rejiggering the rule on whether you can have a game
[01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:38.940]  that demands a controller.
[01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.940]  I understand why people are so concerned
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.860]  about the fact that they don't have a controller.
[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:49.220]  I understand why maybe they wouldn't want to,
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.700]  like maybe the fear was that if they allowed that,
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:54.780]  all the games would do it and it would make the platform-
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:56.860]  Or I think the problem was that if someone bought it
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:58.740]  and then found out they required a controller,
[01:56:58.740 --> 01:56:59.700]  they'd get upset.
[01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:01.300]  Like there was a hard way of telling people
[01:57:01.300 --> 01:57:02.180]  you need a controller to do this.
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:05.900]  Well, that's fixable though in software, right?
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:09.340]  Like that's not a very difficult problem to solve
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:11.340]  because the Apple TV itself knows
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:16.060]  whether a gaming controller has been configured for it.
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:19.340]  Yeah, and I think they were hoping to have that,
[01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:20.980]  but they just did not have that at launch.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:24.540]  So it knows, the system knows
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:26.660]  whether there is a dedicated gaming controller
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:28.420]  paired with it or not.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.140]  And if it's not,
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:33.580]  and the app you're trying to buy requires one,
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:35.820]  it's very easy to put up a prompt that says,
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.140]  this game requires a gaming controller.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:40.460]  Do you still want to buy this?
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:42.940]  Yes or no?
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:46.260]  Well, don't put yes or no buttons up, but buy and cancel.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.780]  Don't get me started on yes and no buttons.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.700]  Yeah, no, I think that's coming.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.260]  I just think they didn't have it in place
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:53.660]  so they flipped the rule.
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:55.180]  Yeah, I guess.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.780]  Maybe that might've been why, hopefully why.
[01:57:56.780 --> 01:57:59.220]  My hope is that they've changed the rule
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:01.340]  because it just wasn't ready to support it yet
[01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:04.140]  and that they fully plan to allow it.
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:06.500]  And you can see from some of the exceptions they've made
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:08.540]  that they seem to be leaning in that direction.
[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:10.860]  Like they do allow you to sell a game
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:14.460]  that requires a dedicated piece of hardware period.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:18.500]  Like Guitar Hero is allowed to require you to buy
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:22.060]  the physical guitar hardware.
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:27.060]  And Disney Infinity is allowed to require
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:31.420]  the little Infinity figurines, right?
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:33.500]  There is Infinity for Apple TV, right?
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.340]  Yes.
[01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:38.380]  I'm glad, either that or I'd imagined it.
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:40.420]  So like Disney Infinity is an ingenious,
[01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:45.420]  I think an ingenious way to make money from a game
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:49.380]  is instead of like in-app purchases,
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:51.260]  like recurring revenue, Disney Infinity,
[01:58:51.260 --> 01:58:52.540]  like to unlock characters,
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:55.540]  you actually have to buy the physical character
[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:56.860]  as like a little action figure.
[01:58:56.860 --> 01:58:58.180]  Yeah, it's like Lego Dimensions
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:00.100]  and that other one that I keep forgetting.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.100]  So that's allowed.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.980]  But what's not allowed is to require
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:07.220]  a generic gaming controller period.
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:11.380]  But clearly some games absolutely positively need it.
[01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:12.220]  Yes.
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.580]  You know, and there's some platformers that have come out.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:16.700]  I forget the name of the one,
[01:59:16.700 --> 01:59:18.940]  but there's a platformer for Apple TV.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:19.900]  It's pretty popular.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:21.780]  And if you don't have a gaming controller,
[01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:23.860]  their way around it is that the character
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:26.180]  sort of like just runs automatically.
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:28.340]  And it turns into more of like
[01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:31.340]  a one button jump type thing.
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.180]  But the game is clearly meant to be played
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.620]  like a regular platformer where you can have full control
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:37.220]  over going left, right, up, down.
[01:59:37.220 --> 01:59:38.300]  Yeah, I don't know if we want to get into
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:40.780]  a whole App Store tangent now,
[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:43.220]  but there's clearly heating up against limitations
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:45.260]  of the old, because the App Store technology is ancient
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.220]  and it comes from iTunes music days
[01:59:47.220 --> 01:59:49.980]  and it needs to be overhauled and it's a huge process.
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:52.380]  But you can't even, right now if I said,
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.780]  John, this is an amazing Apple TV app,
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:56.020]  I have no way of sending it to you.
[01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.340]  I have to tell you to go to search
[01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:00.900]  and start typing this in and maybe you'll get the right,
[02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:03.420]  there are just so many things you can't do with the Apple TV
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.820]  because it wasn't, it's the furthest extreme
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:08.060]  from what the App Store was set up to do originally.
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:10.660]  Yeah, I wonder, I mean, it is crazy though
[02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:12.180]  that there's no way, and it's,
[02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:15.260]  you and I run into this if you write websites
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:19.140]  where like if, I don't know,
[02:00:19.140 --> 02:00:21.100]  if Electronic Arts has a game.
[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:25.140]  Well, if EA.com slash name of the game
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:26.660]  points to their Apple TV game,
[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:28.820]  well, we can link to their website obviously.
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:32.380]  But there is no like Apple TV App Store thing
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:36.860]  that we can link, we can't link directly to the app.
[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.020]  And even if I do, there's no,
[02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:39.860]  I mean, they don't surface WebKit.
[02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:41.380]  WebKit's a private API in the Apple TV
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.660]  so no one can see that and click,
[02:00:42.660 --> 02:00:43.980]  they have to actually physically go
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.180]  and start typing that in on their Apple TV anyway.
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:47.180]  Right, right.
[02:00:47.180 --> 02:00:50.100]  And so A, from the perspective of writing an article
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:51.900]  about an app or a game for Apple TV,
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:53.300]  we can't really link to it directly.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:56.980]  And B, if you're at your TV and you wanna get to it,
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:01.980]  there's no way to, it is weird.
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:03.460]  It's a hard problem, I understand it.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.820]  I'm not saying, this is one of those ones where I laugh
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.180]  because it does seem silly, but I'm not laughing
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.860]  because there's an obvious solution staring us in the face
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:12.740]  and it just seems incomprehensible
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.140]  that they didn't just do X.
[02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:16.100]  It's a long standing issue.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.300]  Like if I'm on Daring Fireball
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:18.580]  and you recommend a great Mac app
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.780]  but I'm looking at it on my iPhone,
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:21.300]  I can hit that Mac App Store link.
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:22.780]  It doesn't help me at all.
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:23.980]  The Apple Watch gets around it
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:25.940]  because it's a slave device right now.
[02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:27.860]  So a companion device right now.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.940]  So it just transfers the app back and forth
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:31.620]  but I can't really get stuff off.
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:34.060]  I can download to iTunes, but it's sort of horrible.
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:36.340]  And it makes you think that there has to be something
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.300]  underway to allow for cross-platform
[02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:40.180]  and even web-based purchases
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:42.300]  because there are all those iTunes preview pages up there
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.140]  and we just haven't gotten there yet.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.100]  Yeah.
[02:01:45.100 --> 02:01:48.140]  It seems like you ought to be able to do some things
[02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:53.140]  that the path forward would be something like
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:58.140]  the way with the Kindle that if you tell me
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:00.460]  about this great book and send me a link
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:03.420]  to the Kindle page for the book
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:05.740]  and my Kindle isn't even with me.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:08.660]  My physical Kindle hardware is at home and I'm at work.
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:11.140]  I can go and buy it now and Amazon will just say,
[02:02:11.140 --> 02:02:12.100]  where do you want this to go?
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:15.620]  And I can say, just send it to my Kindle.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.860]  And when I get home, there it is.
[02:02:16.860 --> 02:02:18.940]  It's already on my Kindle.
[02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:20.780]  It seems like you ought to be able to do something like that
[02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.780]  with your Apple TV where you ought to be able to,
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:24.100]  if you're on a computer,
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:29.100]  there should be a web version of the Apple TV app store
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:31.540]  that if you're signed into your iTunes account,
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:35.820]  you can just buy an app or download it
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.380]  to your Apple TV right from there.
[02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.220]  Absolutely.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:41.180]  And they can even put up a prompt
[02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:42.220]  if you want to go to your Apple TV
[02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:43.980]  said you began a purchase on this.
[02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:45.380]  Do you want to confirm this purchase now?
[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:47.380]  And you press yes and it just downloads
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:49.260]  if they're really worried about people buying things
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.260]  by accident for the wrong platform.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:54.300]  And iTunes is archaic,
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:55.980]  but it's got billions and billions of dollars
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:57.540]  of transactions going over it.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:59.280]  So it's hard to just change it,
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.220]  but it's a bridge that is sort of old and crumbly
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:03.580]  and they have to make sure that that second,
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:05.660]  that new bridge is fully built out
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:08.340]  and then sort of carefully redirect traffic onto it.
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:09.620]  It's not gonna be an easy swap,
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:10.580]  but I really hope,
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:13.260]  sort of like how apple.com this year had that big change
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.180]  where store.apple.com disappeared
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:16.900]  and suddenly it was a modern website
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:18.060]  with everything integrated.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:20.820]  I really hope the same thing has been going on for iTunes.
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.020]  And one day they just flip a switch
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.740]  and we have a modern,
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:27.140]  elegant version of the entire iTunes store stack
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:28.300]  for all the devices.
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:31.500]  I still get thrown off by the new store.apple.com
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:34.740]  because it's so ingrained in me
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:37.260]  that you have to go to a separate website
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.700]  to buy stuff at Apple or see the prices for them
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.780]  or something like that.
[02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:43.140]  And the fact that you don't know, but you know.
[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:44.380]  I click the shopping bag all the time
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:47.080]  expecting there to be a store there that's just empty.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.260]  That's a transition that that team,
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:50.380]  that's the sort of thing
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.860]  because in hindsight it feels like,
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.020]  wow, this is the way it always should have been.
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.400]  The team that did the work on that,
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.460]  it's easy to overlook just how hard that is
[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.380]  to change something that again, like you said,
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:02.060]  adds billions of dollars flowing through it
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:03.620]  and make a change like that
[02:04:03.620 --> 02:04:06.140]  and have it come off as well as it did.
[02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:08.220]  Yeah, just again, we woke up and it changed
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:09.580]  and that's pretty much exactly
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:10.820]  what you wanna have happen with that stuff.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:12.220]  Yeah.
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:14.100]  Before I do the last, I have one more sponsor then,
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:18.740]  but before we do that, we should talk from the September.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:20.900]  We didn't even mention the iPhone 6S yet.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:22.140]  Or the iPad Pro.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:23.260]  Or the iPad Pro.
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.460]  The 6S, you know, it's fantastic.
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:33.220]  I don't think there's much to talk about in hindsight.
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:35.660]  I mean, it's a terrific year over year upgrade
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:36.900]  versus the 6.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:40.540]  Most people don't buy them one year after another,
[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:44.060]  but just in terms of keeping the incremental year over year,
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.620]  it just keeps getting better every year,
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:46.860]  progress moving forward.
[02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:51.100]  It's about as good an update as Apple's ever done.
[02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:54.220]  Yeah, and I think it's once again, an example of the,
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.380]  you know, cause Apple goes to incredible lengths
[02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:58.100]  with these phones and this year it looks the same,
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:59.980]  but it's got 7,000 series aluminum.
[02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:01.260]  The screen looks the same,
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:05.540]  but it's got double density chemically treated glass.
[02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.740]  It is almost to the atom completely redesigned.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.060]  It's got the Taptic Engine inside it,
[02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:11.380]  the A9 processor inside it.
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:14.420]  It's got all the new rigidity to support the 3D touch
[02:05:14.420 --> 02:05:16.220]  because you're actually deforming the glass
[02:05:16.220 --> 02:05:20.460]  on a microscopic level to trigger the pressure sensitivity
[02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:21.300]  in the phone.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.780]  It's got all these really cool elements in it,
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:26.620]  but on the outside, it looks like last year's phone.
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:29.300]  I think, you know, and again,
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:31.100]  maybe I'll sing a different tune a year from now,
[02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:33.900]  but I do think if for somebody who is on a two year,
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.900]  a very much more typical two year upgrade cycle
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.860]  than the idiotic throw money away every year,
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:42.020]  one year upgrade cycle that you and I are on,
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:47.020]  I think the S year is the better year to be on.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:52.020]  Yeah, well, last time it was Touch ID time.
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.700]  Before that it was Siri.
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:58.420]  Yeah, and just little things like the lack of bendability.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:01.580]  Like I think the bend gate clearly was a year ago
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:04.900]  was overblown, but it is true.
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.460]  You know, fundamentally it is true
[02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:07.900]  that with a certain amount of pressure,
[02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:09.820]  you could bend the iPhone.
[02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:11.540]  But metal bands, yeah, it was physics.
[02:06:11.540 --> 02:06:14.300]  And that some people were running into it
[02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.220]  in non-extreme circumstances, you know,
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:19.380]  that they weren't trying to be a jackass
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:21.540]  and purposefully bend it, but it did get bent.
[02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.660]  And it doesn't, you know,
[02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:25.180]  this phone doesn't for a couple of reasons, you know,
[02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:29.140]  for the new aluminum, different structures inside
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:31.100]  that, you know, little things like that just,
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:34.820]  I don't think there was a single faux scandal
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.700]  with the 6S, right?
[02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:38.620]  The two different processors was the closest we got.
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.900]  Yeah, right, the closest we got
[02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:45.420]  was that they were sourcing the CPUs from what, TSMC?
[02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:48.380]  Yeah, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and from Samsung.
[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.500]  And from Samsung.
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:52.300]  And somebody had initially came out
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:56.780]  with some sort of benchmark where the Samsung one was worse
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:57.620]  or was it different?
[02:06:57.620 --> 02:06:58.460]  Well, so it was interesting.
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:00.980]  It's an example of how like a little knowledge is dangerous
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.580]  and chipsets have multiple characteristics
[02:07:03.580 --> 02:07:05.060]  and multiple dimensions.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:08.020]  And on an artificial synthetic test,
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.820]  you could run those chips flat out.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:11.220]  And because of various things,
[02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.180]  including the die size and the different manufacturing
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:15.700]  and how those chips work,
[02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:18.300]  you could deplete the Samsung chip faster.
[02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:19.620]  But that's only measuring how fast
[02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:20.940]  you can deplete it running at maximum.
[02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:22.580]  You're not saying, well, this chip is running hotter
[02:07:22.580 --> 02:07:24.220]  for a longer period of time.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:25.540]  It's almost like you have two sprinters
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:26.740]  and one is quicker off the gate,
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:28.340]  but the other one is stronger in the finish.
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.500]  And you're trying to measure two seconds in
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.260]  who's a better sprinter.
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:33.180]  Right, that was it though.
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.900]  The faux scandal was that the Samsung one
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.620]  would run your battery lower.
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:38.380]  Yeah, you got less battery life with the Samsung,
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:39.860]  which is true in a synthetic benchmark,
[02:07:39.860 --> 02:07:40.900]  but not true in real life.
[02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:42.260]  Right, and I feel like even,
[02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:44.700]  I seem to recall that even the synthetic benchmark
[02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:46.900]  that was used, other people ran it later
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:49.260]  and didn't get results anywhere near as dramatic.
[02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:50.460]  There were differences,
[02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:51.980]  but it wasn't anywhere near as profound
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:52.820]  as initially thought.
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:54.220]  Being on different cell towers would lead
[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:55.700]  to as significant a difference
[02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:57.380]  as running those tests on those chipsets.
[02:07:57.380 --> 02:08:00.580]  Right, so I do feel like,
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.820]  if you're only gonna get one every other year,
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.740]  you're better off on the S cycle than the non S cycle.
[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:06.940]  So that was one of the most interesting stories
[02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:08.340]  for me this year was Apple's beginning
[02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:09.900]  that iPhone upgrade program
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:11.060]  where they're starting to move,
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:12.220]  like to starting to cater people
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:14.740]  who do wanna get a new iPhone every year.
[02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:16.180]  And also sort of building up their,
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:18.420]  the trick for this is that you have to hand in
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:19.900]  your old iPhone, which they can then sell
[02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:21.220]  in emerging markets.
[02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.700]  So it sort of, it helps out with their price differential
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:25.540]  in those emerging markets,
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:26.860]  but it also associates the people
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:28.700]  who do want the new iPhone every year.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:30.620]  And it's, I know people say this almost sarcastically,
[02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.700]  but it is iPhone as a service almost.
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.700]  Yeah, well, and I would compare it
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:38.060]  to the very well established market
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:43.060]  and high end, very lucrative market of automobiles.
[02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:47.420]  And that leasing is long been established
[02:08:47.420 --> 02:08:49.660]  as something that the car makers themselves,
[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:51.700]  the car dealers themselves offer you.
[02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.580]  I hear it, I've been, as I started thinking about the fact
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:08:59.780]  that professionally I'm seems as though
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:03.140]  I might be writing about cars sooner rather than later.
[02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:04.820]  I've started paying a little bit more attention
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:07.900]  and I've noticed that a lot of car advertisements
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.700]  only talk about leasing prices.
[02:09:10.660 --> 02:09:13.660]  And it's exactly analogous.
[02:09:17.380 --> 02:09:18.820]  There's absolutely no difference,
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:23.820]  except that the iPhone costs like 800 to $1,000
[02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:29.020]  and cars cost 20 to $100,000.
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:31.140]  And that was sort of one of the funny other flow scandals
[02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:32.980]  was everyone was panicking, what's Apple gonna do now
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.100]  that all the carriers in the US
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:34.980]  have changed their structure.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.580]  They're not gonna be able to hide the price
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:38.220]  of the iPhone every year,
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:40.660]  ignoring that a Samsung Android phone,
[02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.740]  the high end Android phones cost the same price
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:43.580]  that an iPhone.
[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:44.820]  So it's a universal problem,
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.700]  but also Apple and the carriers are never gonna let
[02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:49.340]  that upfront sticker price show to consumers.
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:50.900]  They're gonna have all these different deals
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:52.380]  that you'll be able to partake in.
[02:09:52.380 --> 02:09:55.860]  Yeah, the worry over that was,
[02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:58.020]  there's obviously some interesting thinking going on
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:01.580]  and it is somebody's problem to solve and to manage,
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:04.660]  but it is definitely a manageable problem.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:08.420]  And the fact that you see BMW commercials
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:11.500]  or you hear John Ham pitching at Mercedes commercials,
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.820]  and then the dollar amount that you hear at the end
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:16.060]  is $400 or something like that.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:19.940]  Well, they're not talking about this.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:21.820]  They don't tell you that's the cost on a Mercedes.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:24.780]  Yeah, that it's $83,000 to walk,
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.540]  to just buy it in cash off the lot.
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:29.340]  Even now they'll say it's like $279 every two weeks
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:30.180]  or something.
[02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:31.820]  I don't care.
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:36.820]  But it's definitely manageable.
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.180]  And it's definitely what,
[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:45.180]  to me is the shift that it's obviously more
[02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:50.500]  of a financial strategy than a product strategy.
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.220]  And it's the product stuff that interests me more
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:53.260]  about the iPhone and Apple,
[02:10:53.260 --> 02:10:55.420]  but it's definitely interesting.
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:58.020]  And I definitely think it's part of the,
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:00.780]  and it's like you said,
[02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:02.580]  that it's just a generic sense
[02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:03.860]  that it's not just nerds like us
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:05.140]  who want a new iPhone every year,
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:09.060]  that maybe I'm overstating just how rare you and I,
[02:11:09.060 --> 02:11:10.580]  people like us are in terms of that,
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:12.260]  that it is that sort of becoming more
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:14.300]  of a mass market mindset.
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:15.220]  Well, and Apple is learning that.
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:17.700]  I mean, we saw that with the gold color iPhone 5S,
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:19.300]  and it turned out people cared more about having
[02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:20.900]  the new color than a lot of other things.
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:22.780]  And now the rose gold iPhone 6S,
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:24.780]  people really wanna have the color that shows
[02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:26.420]  that they have the new iPhone.
[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:28.180]  And we're gonna be going into the iPhone 7,
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:29.340]  and if history repeats itself,
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:31.020]  we're gonna have a new design now.
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:33.020]  And that usually is another tripping point
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:34.580]  for a bunch of people to upgrade again,
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:37.740]  because Tim Cook said, I think it was still only 30
[02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:41.020]  or 40% of people had upgraded to a new iPhone.
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:43.300]  So they have a huge potential market,
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:44.820]  not only in people switching from Android
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:45.700]  or getting their first phone,
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:48.740]  but also in people turning over those iPhones.
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:49.580]  Yeah.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:51.540]  But other than that,
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:53.740]  I don't have much to say about the iPhone 6S.
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:54.580]  Great iPhone, yeah.
[02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:56.820]  It's, you know, great, that's it.
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:01.380]  iPad Pro, should we save it for the next segment?
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:02.220]  Sure.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:03.060]  All right.
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:06.180]  Our last sponsor today, our final sponsor,
[02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:09.900]  is our good friends, the Brower Group.
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:15.740]  Now their app, Ubar2, launched on the talk show last year,
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:17.180]  and it was a great success.
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:20.300]  So they're back with the new Ubar3.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.580]  That's just spelled U, like a lowercase U.
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:24.100]  Just think of it like the apple eye,
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:26.980]  a lowercase U, and then an uppercase B-A-R.
[02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:30.740]  It is a dock replacement for the Mac.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.340]  So we're talking, this is like good old fashioned,
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:35.340]  nerdy type of thing that people who listen
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:39.300]  to the talk show, utility app for the Mac.
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:42.100]  The purpose of Ubar is to vastly increase
[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.620]  your productivity.
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:46.540]  Pro users love it, and they also use it
[02:12:46.540 --> 02:12:48.140]  to help family members or switchers,
[02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:50.220]  because one of the things that Ubar does
[02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.900]  is that you can configure it,
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:53.780]  and like any good nerd utility,
[02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:56.660]  it is very configurable, super configurable.
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:12:57.860]  So one of the ways you can do it
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:13:01.060]  is you can make it run like the Mac dock,
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:03.420]  but like with extra features and stuff like that.
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.260]  But you can also set it up to run
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.180]  as a Windows taskbar style dock.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:11.220]  So for people in your family who maybe have switched
[02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:13.380]  to the Mac recently, and one of the things
[02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:15.140]  that they struggle with are the ways,
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.580]  all the various things that they did
[02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:18.580]  through the Windows taskbar that are different
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:22.100]  through the Mac, you can set Ubar up to run that way.
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:26.100]  And no matter how you configure it, it looks great.
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:28.700]  Just like any great Mac utility,
[02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:33.540]  it doesn't sacrifice visual design
[02:13:33.540 --> 02:13:38.660]  and aesthetic beauty just for the sake of,
[02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:40.580]  you know, nerd-type features.
[02:13:40.580 --> 02:13:41.580]  You know, if you want that type of stuff,
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:43.380]  if you want something ugly to do like that,
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:45.780]  you know, go install Ubuntu or something like that.
[02:13:45.780 --> 02:13:47.540]  This is for people who use a Mac
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:48.940]  and want their stuff to look beautiful.
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:50.340]  So all sorts of shortcuts.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.660]  Here's some of the nerdy stuff you can do.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.740]  Hold down Control when you click on an app,
[02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:56.580]  and you can see the CPU and RAM usage for that app.
[02:13:56.580 --> 02:13:58.580]  Hold down Shift, and you can quit any app
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:14:00.860]  or close any of the individual windows
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:03.940]  that are open within that app just by clicking it.
[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:05.420]  Unresponsive apps, if you have an app
[02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:07.980]  that needs to be ForceQuit, get some red background already
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.100]  so you can see it without even checking,
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:12.100]  you know, the ForceQuit, you know,
[02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:15.660]  Command-Option-Escape window
[02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:17.300]  and all sorts of customizability.
[02:14:17.300 --> 02:14:19.620]  You can adjust the sizes.
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.580]  There's themes.
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:22.740]  You can, just like the way that the system
[02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:25.380]  has light and dark themes, so does Ubar.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:28.100]  You can even create your own custom theme,
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:33.180]  so it's almost getting into, like, kaleidoscope territory.
[02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.660]  You name it, it's got it.
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:35.980]  I can't tell you everything about it.
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:37.260]  Just go to the website and check it out,
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:38.700]  but it's absolutely worth a look,
[02:14:38.700 --> 02:14:43.300]  and that's at Ubar, U-B-A-R, app.com,
[02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:45.060]  and remember the coupon code.
[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:48.820]  The coupon code is Retna Gruber.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:53.620]  Remember that, and you'll save 50% off.
[02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:55.020]  It's 20 bucks ordinarily,
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:57.380]  great price for a utility this serious,
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:14:59.940]  but with that code, you save 50%.
[02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:01.180]  You only pay 10 bucks.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:04.340]  10 bucks, and you get a great app.
[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:05.820]  And one more thing.
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.220]  Maybe you remember this from when they sponsored
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:08.020]  the show before.
[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:10.780]  This is crazy to me,
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:16.420]  but the developer of this app, Edward Brouwer.
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:17.740]  That's where the Brouwer is.
[02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:19.260]  Brouwer. That's where the Brouwer group
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:20.620]  gets the name from.
[02:15:20.620 --> 02:15:23.740]  In addition to being a great app developer
[02:15:23.740 --> 02:15:26.300]  with a great sense of design and stuff like this,
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:29.660]  as a side job, I laugh because this just seems crazy.
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:34.020]  He designs and manufactures
[02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:37.620]  his own beautiful mechanical watches.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:40.180]  He's a watchmaker in addition to making an app,
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:43.380]  and he already launched his newest timepiece.
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:46.780]  It's called the Mirage, and it's available in three colors
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.740]  on the earlier episode of the show.
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.820]  Each one is a limited edition of only 300 pieces,
[02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:55.900]  and they all come with an engraved number on the back.
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:58.300]  Really, really beautiful design on the dial.
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:01.700]  My very favorite thing about this watch is the dial design,
[02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:04.140]  or at least the dial combined with the hands.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:07.060]  Really, really love it.
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:08.540]  Beautiful typography.
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.420]  Really nice. Really nice.
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:15.820]  Just the layout and the proportions.
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:18.740]  And the diameter is very, very reasonable.
[02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:20.060]  40-millimeter diameter.
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:23.540]  This is not a big, hacking, giant watch,
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:27.380]  which a lot of modern mechanical watches are.
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:29.380]  You just have to see it yourself and hit the web.
[02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:30.980]  There's a separate website for that.
[02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:35.620]  Brouwer, B-R-A-W-E-R, timepieces.com.
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:38.620]  And exact same code, Retina Gruber.
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.300]  You don't need to memorize a separate code.
[02:16:41.300 --> 02:16:43.300]  Now, this is a serious watch. It's a mechanical watch.
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:46.180]  The retail price, $750.
[02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:47.820]  It's a great price for a mechanical watch.
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:49.860]  It's a lot if you're a casual risk buyer,
[02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:52.540]  but this is totally within the realm
[02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:55.780]  of what a handmade mechanical watch is meant to cost.
[02:16:55.780 --> 02:16:59.940]  But if you use that code, Retina Gruber, 40% off,
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:02.460]  and shipping is free in the U.S. and Canada.
[02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:05.180]  So go check them out, ubarapp.com,
[02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:08.740]  browertimepieces.com, and on both of them,
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.540]  you'll save a lot of dough
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:15.220]  if you use the code, Retina Gruber.
[02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:20.420]  Love this guy. He's also a very, very nice guy, Edward Brouwer.
[02:17:20.420 --> 02:17:22.660]  And I've been e-mailing him about a little app
[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:24.620]  that he's working on on the side next thing coming up.
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:26.060]  Very, very nice guy, thoughtful guy,
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:29.220]  but I kind of hate him because he makes me feel like...
[02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:31.140]  It's the same way that I get so angry at you sometimes,
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:33.620]  like, when you are so productive and, you know, like,
[02:17:33.620 --> 02:17:38.140]  I feel like I struggle to get, like, one or two good pieces
[02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:40.980]  on Daring Fireball and a podcast out in a week,
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.060]  and then you have, like, 7,000 words on iMore
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:45.980]  and a comprehensive review of a new thing
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:47.300]  that only came out the day before
[02:17:47.300 --> 02:17:49.460]  and, like, four or five podcasts.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:51.820]  So you make me angry, but this guy makes me angrier
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:55.500]  because he's running a full-time software business
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.180]  with a great app.
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:00.460]  The differences between Ubar 2 and 3 are humongous.
[02:18:00.460 --> 02:18:03.260]  It is absolutely remarkable.
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:05.740]  He's got a remarkable amount of new features in there
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:08.260]  in a remarkably short amount of time,
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.900]  and in the meantime, he also makes really nice...
[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:13.180]  And those watches are legit.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:14.740]  I went and took a look at them after the last spot,
[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.460]  and they're amazing.
[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:17.620]  I just don't understand.
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:20.260]  I don't understand how he does that.
[02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:21.460]  They're Renaissance people.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.020]  Yeah, it makes me mad.
[02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:26.300]  It makes me feel like I'm running in slow motion.
[02:18:26.300 --> 02:18:28.900]  Apple, the iPad Pro.
[02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:30.620]  Yes.
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:33.020]  I don't really have much to say about it.
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:35.420]  I think it is absolutely remarkable.
[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:37.460]  I think it is...
[02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:41.060]  It is maybe the best, single best,
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:44.540]  of iOS device that's been made.
[02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:45.540]  I mean, I don't know how...
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:47.100]  It's kind of a hard thing to settle.
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:50.380]  I mean, I could make the case for the iPhone 6S, too.
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:54.100]  I could also make the case maybe for the iPad Mini 4,
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:55.540]  which we forgot to mention.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:57.380]  That came out in September.
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:00.500]  Which is a great tablet, too.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.100]  It is.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:05.020]  We got one for Jonas upgrading a very old iPad for him,
[02:19:05.020 --> 02:19:07.820]  and just looking at it, it's perfect.
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:09.580]  It is...
[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:13.540]  Especially, to me, the difference between the Mini
[02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:17.460]  and the iPad Air is,
[02:19:17.460 --> 02:19:20.620]  are you old enough that you want things
[02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:22.220]  to be bigger visually?
[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:23.780]  Because it's the exact same number of pixels,
[02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:24.820]  and the layout's identical.
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:26.300]  You don't have to do anything as a developer
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.820]  to do for that.
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:29.980]  It's just, do you want it small, or do you want it big?
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:31.620]  And I'm at the point now,
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:33.660]  with the eye medical issues aside, too,
[02:19:33.660 --> 02:19:35.820]  but just at the age that I'm at,
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:37.300]  I kind of want the bigger one.
[02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:39.940]  It doesn't have the X in the processor, either,
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:41.220]  but there's so few people
[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:43.540]  that are gonna actually push it to that limit.
[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:46.340]  But for someone like Jonas,
[02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:48.980]  who has perfect vision as an 11-year-old,
[02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.100]  or almost 12-year-old,
[02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.300]  it's clearly the better iPad for him.
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:53.140]  He loves it.
[02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:55.980]  I mean, absolutely adores the size.
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:58.700]  I can make the case for that, too.
[02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:00.460]  But the iPad Pro,
[02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:04.260]  it's the performance on the device
[02:20:04.260 --> 02:20:07.060]  that just sort of startles me.
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:07.900]  I was joking.
[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:09.660]  I picked mine up in New York, like I think you did,
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:12.260]  and on the way back, I passed by the Microsoft store,
[02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:15.860]  and I could hear all those Intel processors just crying,
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:18.060]  and maybe trying to jump off the table.
[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:21.780]  I want to write about this soon,
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:23.140]  because I think it's been,
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:27.700]  I think people have taken it the wrong way,
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:32.300]  is the angle that this spells doom
[02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.580]  for Intel in the long run.
[02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:36.180]  And it's not,
[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:38.300]  and I know part of my argument for this
[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:40.780]  as just making just like a sanity check,
[02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:42.740]  and not just going by gut feeling,
[02:20:42.740 --> 02:20:46.380]  or what I think makes for an interesting story,
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:47.500]  but actually trying to measure it
[02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:49.660]  as using Geekbench scores,
[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:57.660]  and just showing that the iPad Pro beats the MacBook One.
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:20:58.500]  But I mean, it's hard,
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:00.460]  because this was a really good year for Apple Silicon.
[02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:02.700]  The Apple, the A9 is a real leap forward,
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:04.260]  where Intel really struggled
[02:21:04.260 --> 02:21:07.740]  to get the 10-nanometer process out,
[02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:08.940]  and to get Broadwell,
[02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:10.500]  because there's a Broadwell Y,
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:13.820]  which is core M, I think is a marketing term in the MacBook,
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.260]  and it's not a great chip.
[02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:19.180]  So the iPad Pro hit it out the park while Intel,
[02:21:19.180 --> 02:21:20.660]  during a year that Intel was struggling.
[02:21:20.660 --> 02:21:21.940]  So that, and that's a great point,
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:24.100]  but I think that it's more,
[02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:29.100]  it's not so much like one test of these two devices
[02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:31.420]  at this snapshot in time,
[02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:34.020]  but it's the overall trend line.
[02:21:34.020 --> 02:21:37.900]  And in the way that like intersecting trend lines
[02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:39.940]  over a long period of time,
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:41.500]  at the point where they intersect,
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:44.500]  maybe next year the MacBook One is faster
[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:47.060]  than next year's iPad Pro.
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:48.820]  But if it is, it won't be by much.
[02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:50.660]  And three, four, five years from now,
[02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:52.420]  I don't think there's any question.
[02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:57.300]  And there's also the issue of being fast enough,
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:59.260]  that it doesn't even matter
[02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:03.180]  whether there's other Macs or MacBooks that get faster.
[02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:05.220]  And just in terms of looking at the trend line,
[02:22:05.220 --> 02:22:07.180]  like just go back three, four, five years,
[02:22:07.180 --> 02:22:09.300]  and look at the original iPad or the iPad Two,
[02:22:09.300 --> 02:22:10.740]  or even the iPad Three,
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:13.180]  and where they stood performance-wise
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:17.340]  compared to the MacBook Airs of the time.
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:19.060]  And it was no comparison.
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:21.420]  In terms of anything that you would measure
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:24.340]  like on Geekbench or something like that, they were behind.
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:26.660]  But that gap has narrowed steadily
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:28.700]  and steadily as years go by.
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:33.700]  The A9 chips and ARM chips in general, industry-wide,
[02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:39.180]  are getting better faster than Intel chips
[02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:42.940]  because the scale is just so much bigger.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:47.100]  I think it's also, again, Apple has considerable advantage
[02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:48.500]  in that they make their own chips.
[02:22:48.500 --> 02:22:50.420]  Intel has to sell those chips at a profit
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:52.740]  and they have to support a variety of different,
[02:22:52.740 --> 02:22:54.300]  like they have to run Windows, they have to run Linux,
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:55.860]  they have to run OS X.
[02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:57.980]  And you look at something like the A9X
[02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:01.180]  and it can run three, 4K streams at the same time.
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:03.300]  And that would just grind a lot of Intel,
[02:23:03.300 --> 02:23:05.260]  even Intel-based Macs into the ground.
[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:06.260]  It just can't do that.
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:07.740]  But Apple built those chips to do it.
[02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:09.460]  They can purpose-build all of those chips
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.100]  for exactly what they wanna do.
[02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.620]  And that gives them an incredible amount of flexibility.
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:16.860]  And even in ARM, I mean, Qualcomm has been struggling.
[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:18.020]  Samsung has been struggling.
[02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:18.860]  They're their own fab.
[02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:20.900]  They should arguably have way better chips than Apple,
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:22.620]  but they just don't have the designers.
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:23.900]  Apple's got great designers.
[02:23:23.900 --> 02:23:24.740]  They've got the advantage
[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.620]  of building exactly for their hardware.
[02:23:26.620 --> 02:23:29.340]  I mean, if they could run on Intel's 10-nanometer process,
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:31.620]  I think we'd have the best chips in the world.
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:33.860]  I think we already do, but we'd have even better ones.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:38.780]  It's a good, it's such an interesting question as to why,
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:41.100]  how can Samsung manufacture these for Apple,
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.780]  but can't do it for themselves?
[02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:44.620]  It's the same reason
[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:46.620]  why they can't align ports on a Galaxy phone.
[02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:48.380]  They just, it's just not something that's part,
[02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:49.980]  they just don't have the people.
[02:23:52.140 --> 02:23:54.820]  It really is to me just eye-opening
[02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:57.540]  when you use the iPad Pro that, you know,
[02:23:57.540 --> 02:23:59.380]  that my complaints about it,
[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:01.220]  trying to use it instead of a MacBook
[02:24:01.220 --> 02:24:04.020]  are almost entirely software-based.
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:06.660]  It's just the design of iOS itself to me
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:09.740]  not being conducive to the sort of things
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:11.540]  I wanna do on a Mac in terms of
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:13.380]  how do I take advantage of this big screen
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:14.820]  and how does, you know,
[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:17.300]  like as much as I do like the split-screen stuff
[02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:18.980]  that they've added to iOS 9,
[02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:21.460]  but to me, it's not as,
[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.260]  it's still not as useful as the way
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:28.460]  that I can have multiple things on screen at once on a Mac.
[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.140]  And as I wrote my review,
[02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:35.380]  I'm frustrated at the lack of keyboard navigability,
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:37.420]  that if you're supposed to fundamentally
[02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:39.780]  be able to use this device if you want
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:41.740]  while it's hooked up to a keyboard,
[02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:44.460]  I don't wanna have to reach up and touch the screen
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:46.700]  to do some things because it's,
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:49.460]  it really is exactly as Apple's been telling us
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.300]  for a long time, ergonomically terrible.
[02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:53.660]  Yeah, my understanding is a lot of that stuff
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:55.220]  just didn't make the cut for iOS 9,
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:57.860]  but it has been and will be worked on.
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:24:58.700]  Yeah.
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:24:59.620]  It sort of makes sense that it has to be.
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:03.700]  Yeah, and I've heard from some friends within the company,
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:06.980]  you know, that absolutely some of these things
[02:25:06.980 --> 02:25:08.940]  are a frustration,
[02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:10.860]  like including the thing I observed
[02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:15.140]  about the fact that when you command tab,
[02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:17.180]  the multitasking goes from left to right
[02:25:17.180 --> 02:25:19.900]  cause they just put like a brain dead port
[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:22.780]  of the Mac command tab switcher in
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:27.020]  and the new system-wide like double click the home button
[02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.860]  and touch the screen switcher goes right to left
[02:25:29.860 --> 02:25:32.500]  in terms of most recent to oldest.
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.700]  Even though the old built-in switcher
[02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:41.100]  that was there for iOS 7 and 8 was left to right.
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:43.300]  Yeah, you're colliding with the force press,
[02:25:43.300 --> 02:25:45.580]  the force swipe on the iPhone 6s there
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:46.420]  cause they wanted that,
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:48.540]  the back gesture goes from left to right
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:51.860]  and so the force back gesture had to go from left to right.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:54.220]  And you know, what I heard after I wrote about
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.980]  some of this stuff is, yeah, we know.
[02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:58.460]  Yeah, well, they hit it first.
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:00.540]  I mean, the best thing about the iPad Pro right now
[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:02.020]  and if you look at the 60 minutes segment,
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:03.580]  how many of the executive team members
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.140]  had iPad Pros in front of them
[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:08.100]  is that it's gonna be almost like the Steve Jobs days
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.140]  where anything that doesn't work
[02:26:09.140 --> 02:26:10.900]  is gonna get immediate executive attention.
[02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:12.140]  I don't trust that though.
[02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:14.660]  I would just say that I don't trust anything I saw
[02:26:14.660 --> 02:26:18.500]  in the 60 minute thing as indicative
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:19.700]  of what they actually use.
[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:20.780]  I wouldn't be surprised,
[02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:22.980]  but I would take it all with a grain of salt
[02:26:22.980 --> 02:26:24.580]  in terms of stage management.
[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:25.700]  Although apparently some of them do,
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:28.260]  like that has become at least for now their go-to machine.
[02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:30.020]  Oh, I wouldn't be surprised, you know,
[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:33.380]  and I think it's a tremendous like, you know,
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:35.940]  a meeting situation is tremendous.
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:37.740]  It's almost where you'd rather have a device
[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:40.780]  that is less likely to distract you
[02:26:40.780 --> 02:26:42.500]  and if you just wanna put up a notes app
[02:26:42.500 --> 02:26:43.660]  and have it be full screen
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:47.460]  and I think it's tremendous for a scenario like that.
[02:26:47.460 --> 02:26:49.420]  Yeah, and it's interesting as a device
[02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:50.500]  because we are hitting this point
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:51.980]  where the MacBook has gone down
[02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:53.740]  to be as close as possible to an iPad
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:56.300]  and the iPad has gone up to be as close as possible
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:26:58.420]  to a MacBook, but both of them,
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:59.820]  both of them are still very separate things.
[02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:03.140]  Like the MacBook doesn't have any real touch awareness.
[02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:05.220]  It's not a touch friendly environment.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:07.460]  It's not really a mobile friendly environment.
[02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:10.900]  And likewise, your frustrations with the keyboard on iOS
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.220]  and even though split screen is nice,
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:13.980]  there's no multi window, there's no drag and drop.
[02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:15.220]  There aren't any of these conventions
[02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:18.340]  that are basically muscle memory to people like us now
[02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.620]  and you sort of, there's no middle ground.
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:23.220]  You have to pick a side and neither side is perfect.
[02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:29.340]  I saw somebody on Twitter the other day
[02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:32.020]  was posted a little video where they just said,
[02:27:32.020 --> 02:27:33.860]  hey, finally saw the iPad Pro.
[02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:35.740]  It's like somebody who hadn't seen one in a store yet.
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:38.420]  And it was like, here's how I tried,
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:39.380]  not trying to be a jerk,
[02:27:39.380 --> 02:27:41.180]  but they videotaped it with their,
[02:27:41.180 --> 02:27:42.980]  they shot video with their iPhone.
[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:46.620]  Here's me trying to attach a photo to a mail
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:50.380]  and they had mail on the left and photos on the right.
[02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:53.060]  And they tried to tap and hold on a photo
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:55.780]  and then drag it over across that divide.
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:57.220]  And of course it didn't work.
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:00.340]  Yeah, again, you got to figure that stuff is being worked on
[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:01.620]  but it's like, do you touch and hold?
[02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:03.860]  Do you afford, like, what is gonna be the affordance
[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:05.020]  for that sort of activity?
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:06.980]  And they have to make sure it doesn't collide
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:10.140]  with all the other gestures that are being used in iOS.
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:11.500]  But I think all that is coming,
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.220]  the last time I was on, I think we spoke about,
[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:15.780]  I have this longstanding desire for iPad OS.
[02:28:15.780 --> 02:28:17.380]  Like I think the same way there's watch OS
[02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:18.820]  and the watch got its distinct thing
[02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:21.700]  and there's TV OS and the Apple TV got its distinct thing.
[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:24.540]  I'm glad that the iPad is getting some features now
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:27.420]  but I still think it needs that concept
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:29.300]  of keep backboard, keep front board,
[02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.580]  but take springboard and think of something
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:33.260]  that really is tablet first
[02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:35.700]  and it takes advantage of things like the iPad Pro.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:38.140]  Yeah, and that's the sort of thing.
[02:28:38.140 --> 02:28:40.020]  It was definitely the last time you were on the show.
[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:41.140]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:42.420]  In fact, I agree more.
[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:44.980]  I agreed then, I agree even more now
[02:28:44.980 --> 02:28:47.220]  that it's whether they asked what they'd call it.
[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.460]  No, I don't think they should call it that.
[02:28:48.460 --> 02:28:49.340]  Just call it iOS.
[02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:52.500]  But what it should be fundamentally though is iPad OS.
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:57.020]  Is what if iOS was meant only for the iPad?
[02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:58.820]  What should it be like
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:28:59.860]  and how do we do that?
[02:28:59.860 --> 02:29:01.980]  How do we get from here to there?
[02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:03.580]  And the iPad suffers the same problem
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:04.540]  that the Mac App Store does
[02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:06.220]  and that it has a much more successful sibling.
[02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:08.380]  So when you get resources, they go to the iOS App Store.
[02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:10.260]  When you get resources, it goes to the iPhone
[02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:12.020]  and then they're ported up to the iPad.
[02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:14.180]  And now that we have broken through with split view
[02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:15.420]  and with some of the keyboard stuff,
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:17.060]  I hope that that continues.
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:18.620]  And I know it's one of those things
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:20.780]  where people inside Apple have the same arguments
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:22.580]  that we have outside of Apple.
[02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:25.020]  And I just hope that those people start
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:27.500]  to get more sway within it because I think as a device,
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.020]  if Apple is confident that this is the future
[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:31.140]  of personal computing for them,
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:32.260]  I think they really need to give it
[02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:33.420]  the attention it deserves.
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:36.820]  And that brings us to the single most important product
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:39.140]  that Apple introduced in 2015.
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:42.980]  The smart battery case.
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:47.580]  I've been forcing myself to use it
[02:29:47.580 --> 02:29:48.500]  for the last week and a half.
[02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:51.020]  I switched away from the iPhone 6S Plus
[02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:53.260]  and been using the 6S with the battery case.
[02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:58.260]  If you got used to the Plus, if you like the Plus,
[02:30:00.220 --> 02:30:02.380]  I can't see how you could.
[02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:04.740]  I don't, but I like to make sure
[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:06.940]  that when I review a product that I go back
[02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:08.220]  and actually, because it's impossible
[02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:10.020]  to review a product properly when you first get it
[02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:12.580]  because there's enormous pressure to get that review up.
[02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:14.820]  And not pressure from Apple or anybody,
[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:17.860]  but just people don't care anymore after a couple of weeks.
[02:30:17.860 --> 02:30:19.100]  They won't even bother reading it.
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:20.420]  So I wanted to take a look at it
[02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:21.700]  and I wanted to understand it
[02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:23.460]  because if you want a bigger built-in battery,
[02:30:23.460 --> 02:30:27.020]  you get the iPhone 6S Plus, it's what it's there for.
[02:30:27.020 --> 02:30:28.540]  And it's nice because it's elongated
[02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:30.460]  and it dissipates heat really well.
[02:30:30.460 --> 02:30:32.220]  But there's a whole sort of,
[02:30:32.220 --> 02:30:34.260]  and people think that Apple wants to make lighter phones.
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:36.180]  They don't, they want to make thinner phones.
[02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:37.220]  They want to make lighter phones.
[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:39.220]  They want to make phones that have great radio reception.
[02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:40.940]  There's all sorts of trade-offs that you have to do
[02:30:40.940 --> 02:30:42.700]  when you have things like batteries
[02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.940]  and things like radios and phones.
[02:30:44.940 --> 02:30:47.940]  So the iPhone 6, I think Apple, again, is very sincere
[02:30:47.940 --> 02:30:49.300]  when they say that for some people,
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:52.060]  it just wasn't enough to do things that were more
[02:30:52.060 --> 02:30:53.100]  than an average day.
[02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:54.780]  They wanted to give them the option.
[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:56.580]  And if you build that in, you can't take it off.
[02:30:56.580 --> 02:30:58.640]  If you have a heavy phone that's twice as thick,
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:31:00.380]  you can't pull that off when you don't need it.
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:01.780]  So you make a case.
[02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:03.400]  And then you want the case as one piece
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.180]  and you want a case that doesn't interfere with the radio.
[02:31:05.180 --> 02:31:06.920]  Maybe it even makes the radio better
[02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:08.740]  because that way the radio doesn't have to ramp up
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:11.260]  and use even more power when it's got a battery case on,
[02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:13.340]  because that defeats the purpose of a battery case.
[02:31:13.340 --> 02:31:15.480]  And you sort of go through the requirements of it
[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.800]  and you end up with a case that doesn't look great,
[02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:20.580]  but works really, really well.
[02:31:20.580 --> 02:31:22.660]  And then you get this, you know,
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:24.500]  previously it was Apple only cares about design.
[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:25.740]  They don't care about functionality.
[02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:26.900]  And they make something really functional
[02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:28.700]  and immediately it gets slammed for the design of it,
[02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:30.340]  which I think is endlessly interesting.
[02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:33.720]  I spent, you know, definitely a full week with it.
[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:34.560]  I think maybe even longer.
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:35.940]  And I was wearing it all the time.
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:40.400]  And I keep thinking if there's one thing I wish I'd,
[02:31:40.400 --> 02:31:44.260]  I wish I'd mentioned in my piece writing about it,
[02:31:44.260 --> 02:31:48.260]  is maybe a little bit more emphasis on feel,
[02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:50.880]  what it feels like as opposed to what it looks like.
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:51.780]  Cause it definitely looks.
[02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:55.140]  And I, you know, I don't, I don't think I held back.
[02:31:55.140 --> 02:31:57.180]  I think I called it funny looking, weird looking.
[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:58.500]  It's definitely a weird looking.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:31:59.940]  I called it awkward and ugly.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:02.960]  But it definitely doesn't feel bad.
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:06.860]  And I, without question think that it feels better in hand
[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:10.660]  than any of the Mophie cases that I've ever tried
[02:32:10.660 --> 02:32:13.180]  because they make the phone feel entirely fat
[02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:14.620]  from left to right.
[02:32:14.620 --> 02:32:15.980]  They make you stretch your hand over it
[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.780]  where this one, the hump sort of falls into your palm
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:18.980]  and your fingers go on either side.
[02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:22.100]  So I would argue, and you know, if somebody,
[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.820]  clearly this is the realm of subjectivity.
[02:32:23.820 --> 02:32:25.580]  If somebody else would disagree, sure.
[02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:28.540]  But I feel very confident arguing that for me at least,
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.500]  I think for many others,
[02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:32.600]  it feels better than a Mophie style case.
[02:32:32.600 --> 02:32:34.940]  And if somebody else wants to argue
[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:38.340]  that it looks worse to them, I wouldn't disagree.
[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:40.340]  And I, you know, that's subjective.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:43.620]  But that, you know, and I think Joanna Stern said it best
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:47.460]  in her review, all battery charging cases are ugly.
[02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:49.780]  They, it's been one way or another.
[02:32:49.780 --> 02:32:51.340]  And Apple's is not an exception.
[02:32:51.340 --> 02:32:55.320]  It's a really, it's as to date an unsolved problem
[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:57.800]  to make a case that is a battery
[02:32:57.800 --> 02:33:00.980]  that will contain a significant charge for the battery
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:04.260]  that isn't ugly and thick.
[02:33:04.260 --> 02:33:05.740]  It's like the headset jack.
[02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:07.620]  Right now, a lot of headphones won't fit into it,
[02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:08.440]  but what do you do?
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.280]  You can't make a bigger hole
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:11.660]  because you destroy the structure of the bottom of the phone.
[02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:13.540]  There are problems that you just can't solve
[02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:14.500]  in a good way yet.
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:15.340]  Right.
[02:33:15.340 --> 02:33:19.100]  And I think that this is a very reasonable compromise.
[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:23.380]  And I think it's interesting.
[02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:25.580]  And I liked that Apple tried this.
[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:27.740]  I liked that Apple decided it was better
[02:33:27.740 --> 02:33:30.360]  to do this imperfections aside,
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.260]  rather than not do it at all.
[02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:33.460]  And apparently they've been working on it
[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:34.640]  for like, it came out late.
[02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:36.300]  Like no one really expected it to come out in December
[02:33:36.300 --> 02:33:38.420]  and they've been working on it for a long time.
[02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:39.520]  And again, like people measure,
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:43.380]  oh, it's got like the MAH milliamps
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:45.220]  are lower in this than something else.
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:46.340]  But that's not in context.
[02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:48.920]  In context, it doesn't waste radio,
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:50.940]  which saves a tremendous amount of battery.
[02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:52.860]  And also at Apple, because Apple is Apple,
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:54.060]  they can integrate it to the point
[02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:55.940]  where it knows it's connected to a case
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:57.300]  and not to an outlet.
[02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:59.700]  So it doesn't turn on all the background processes
[02:33:59.700 --> 02:34:01.420]  and start downloading and doing all the networking
[02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:03.220]  that it would in another battery case,
[02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:04.500]  which saves even more power.
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:06.700]  So they sort of optimized for efficiency
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:08.540]  and not for raw volume of battery.
[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:11.380]  Yeah, and I kind of feel like I thought,
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:12.420]  when I read reviews of it,
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:13.940]  that a lot of them mentioned,
[02:34:13.940 --> 02:34:16.420]  and to me, this is just, it's the wrong way of doing it,
[02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:18.580]  is you have to understand what it's supposed to be used for.
[02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:20.980]  But the test that a lot of people tried to use was,
[02:34:20.980 --> 02:34:24.460]  all right, take an iPhone that's completely down to zero
[02:34:24.460 --> 02:34:26.780]  and plug it in and how far do you get?
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:28.380]  And you don't even, you know, the complaint was
[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:30.180]  it doesn't even get you back a full charge.
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:31.540]  It doesn't get you back to 100%.
[02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:32.380]  Like 80% or something.
[02:34:32.380 --> 02:34:34.000]  That's not the use case of it though.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.340]  The use case of it is not how far does it get you
[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:38.820]  from a completely dead phone.
[02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:42.540]  It's what is your battery life if you, you know,
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:44.780]  if you're having, what is your battery life like
[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:47.380]  if you keep it in it from the start of the day?
[02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:51.300]  And the answer is it easily gets you through the whole day
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:53.220]  of very heavy use.
[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:54.700]  That's why it doesn't have a switch on it too,
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:57.940]  because that's not something a human should be managing.
[02:34:57.940 --> 02:34:59.300]  That's something the software should be managing.
[02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:02.060]  Right, whereas the thing, and like I mentioned,
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:03.980]  it's the thing I personally prefer
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:05.260]  than a battery charging case,
[02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:08.460]  is a little pocket-sized external battery.
[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:09.700]  That's the sort of thing though,
[02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:11.660]  where you do want to know how much, you know,
[02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:16.140]  where the mega amps or whatever amps, M-H-W-R,
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.680]  where they, where that really matters.
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:20.820]  Where let's say if I take one with me
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:23.500]  and where my family's at Disney World all day,
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:25.620]  where maybe I'll charge my phone up a little bit
[02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:26.740]  and then give it to my wife
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:28.740]  and let her charge her phone up a little bit.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:31.580]  And maybe plug in your iPad for some time.
[02:35:31.580 --> 02:35:33.980]  In theory, yeah, or for one,
[02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:35.660]  the ones that would charge an iPad are,
[02:35:35.660 --> 02:35:37.540]  I would call them bigger than pocket size.
[02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:40.620]  But if you're carrying a bag around, it's easily, you know,
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:41.940]  I can certainly see why a lot of people
[02:35:41.940 --> 02:35:43.180]  do put them in their bag.
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:46.060]  That's where that matters.
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.980]  For something that's supposed to get you
[02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:50.920]  all day battery life, even with heavy use,
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.500]  the amount of energy that's in the Apple One
[02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:54.940]  is more than enough.
[02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:56.820]  The larger piece that I've seen,
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:58.740]  and I think you've, I know you've seen this,
[02:35:58.740 --> 02:36:00.580]  there's a bunch of people who've had like,
[02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:01.640]  it was sort of like,
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.820]  this is the year Apple Design went to shit.
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:06.860]  And their arguments are more or less,
[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:09.620]  the battery case is ugly,
[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:13.660]  the Apple TV remote is symmetric,
[02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.620]  so that it's hard to tell which way it's pointed.
[02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:17.900]  Yeah, they're incredibly ignorant pieces.
[02:36:17.900 --> 02:36:22.700]  The Apple Pencil charge is like a big skinny wang
[02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:24.920]  hanging out of your iPad Pro.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.920]  And the MacBook doesn't have enough USB ports.
[02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:32.080]  And they lump them all together and they're like,
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:33.820]  there you go, Apple's going to shit.
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:37.100]  And I would say that there is some merit
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:38.300]  to some of these complaints.
[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:41.580]  And there is no merit to some of these complaints.
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:44.600]  And some of them are not really an,
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:45.700]  they want to lump it all together
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:49.000]  and say that Apple is losing its way without Steve Jobs
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.480]  and Johnny Ive is, I don't know,
[02:36:53.380 --> 02:36:54.860]  not paying attention or something like that.
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:56.780]  Often an arboretum somewhere in Belgium.
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:58.980]  Right, and I don't think,
[02:36:58.980 --> 02:37:00.920]  I think there's some merit to some of the complaints,
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.040]  but I don't think that any of them are worrisome
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.200]  with the possible existence, the exception of Apple Music.
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:10.500]  I think a lot of them are incredibly lazy
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:12.060]  and just that they didn't try to understand
[02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:13.660]  why the design was done the way it was
[02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.680]  before they criticized it.
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:16.460]  Some of the points are absolutely valid,
[02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.580]  but Apple has always had a design
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:20.420]  that you could criticize every year,
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:24.140]  pre-Steve Jobs, after the second coming of Steve Jobs,
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:25.220]  during Tim Cook's reign,
[02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:28.540]  there's always been design elements that weren't great.
[02:37:28.540 --> 02:37:31.740]  I mean, MobileMe again, famously under Steve Jobs.
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:33.500]  The thing that's interesting to me is like, again,
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:35.300]  do people take the time to understand it?
[02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:37.380]  There was criticism that the iPad Pro
[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:39.660]  had this empty space for the speakers
[02:37:39.660 --> 02:37:41.460]  and they should have been filled with battery.
[02:37:41.460 --> 02:37:42.300]  But then you sort of think,
[02:37:42.300 --> 02:37:44.020]  how heavy would that make the iPad Pro?
[02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:46.740]  And you are legally not allowed to ship batteries,
[02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:48.620]  like lithium ion batteries of a certain size.
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.240]  So it'd be great to have an iPad Pro
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:52.700]  that you cannot ship to a customer.
[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.280]  And all these, or there was an article
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.200]  about how Apple was posting a job listing
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:38:00.980]  for someone to use Avid and Adobe Premiere.
[02:38:00.980 --> 02:38:02.420]  And there was a whole article
[02:38:02.420 --> 02:38:04.700]  on how even Apple doesn't want to use Final Cut anymore.
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:06.860]  And that was actually for the Beats office
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:08.780]  in Culver City outside Los Angeles,
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:11.460]  which has only ever been using those products
[02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:13.660]  and hasn't been integrated into Apple's play.
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:14.500]  So there's just like,
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:16.780]  those are like sort of lazy articles in my opinion.
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.240]  Yeah, well, I totally agree with that.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:23.480]  And I saw that about the Final Cut Pro
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:26.020]  not being listed as a thing for the job and it was Beats.
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:27.860]  You can argue though that it still is damning
[02:38:27.860 --> 02:38:29.540]  against Final Cut Pro X
[02:38:29.540 --> 02:38:32.960]  that somebody outside Apple wasn't using it
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.940]  because without it, that they should have,
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.800]  that a Final Cut Pro X is what it should be,
[02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:40.820]  that they would have been using it.
[02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:42.120]  That every customer would use it,
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:43.720]  although Apple increasingly is not targeting
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:45.420]  every customer with their products.
[02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:47.200]  Yeah, I think a discussion of what's gone wrong
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:49.880]  with Final Cut Pro X is beyond the scope of this episode,
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:51.140]  but it'd be worth talking about.
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:52.620]  But the Apple music, the control,
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:54.500]  yeah, there's absolutely things worth criticizing.
[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.900]  The one that I find the most frustrating
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.520]  and the one that I think is the most clearly talked about
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:00.980]  is the Apple Pencil,
[02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:04.520]  which is that if you, and I swear to God,
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.460]  the Gizmodo article was more or less
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:10.800]  in terms of what's bad about Apple design
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:13.980]  and all the stuff in 2015, they were like Apple Pencil,
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:16.660]  enough said, and it's just a picture of it charging
[02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:18.700]  while it sticks off the table.
[02:39:18.700 --> 02:39:20.340]  And the mouse, the charger and the mouse.
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.220]  Oh yeah, the try it, yeah, and they lump that in.
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:23.060]  So that's a good one.
[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:26.020]  The charger and the mouse on the bottom.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:29.280]  That's an interesting one.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.300]  That's separate than the Pencil,
[02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:32.080]  but they lump them together.
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:34.900]  With the Pencil, if you write for a site
[02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:37.340]  that is ostensibly focused on technology at all,
[02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:39.160]  as Gizmodo supposedly is,
[02:39:39.160 --> 02:39:41.320]  and the only thing you're gonna say about the Pencil
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:43.020]  in your article about its design
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:44.280]  is this is what it looks like
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:47.340]  when you're charging it from the iPad
[02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:50.420]  and not even mention that it is,
[02:39:50.420 --> 02:39:52.760]  I really think without any kind of hyperbole
[02:39:52.760 --> 02:39:55.660]  that it's revolutionized stylus input
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:57.220]  in human computer interaction.
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:58.960]  I used Wacom tablets for 10 years
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:01.400]  and this is the absolute best stylus I have ever used.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:04.180]  Right, there have been ones that work on devices
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:07.320]  with very low refraction
[02:40:07.320 --> 02:40:10.780]  because the surface is close to the glass,
[02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:12.720]  just like all of the various styluses
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:16.000]  for the work on all other iOS devices by Capacitive.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.980]  And there have been Wacom things
[02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:20.820]  that work with lower latency and stuff, but have all these,
[02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:23.420]  but none of them, they've reduced all of these trade-offs
[02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:27.900]  and when you talk to people who do artwork
[02:40:27.900 --> 02:40:29.400]  with this sort of stuff,
[02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:33.460]  that they're just over the moon about the potential.
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:34.380]  It just feels like a Pencil,
[02:40:34.380 --> 02:40:38.020]  it is the best digital pen instrument I've ever used.
[02:40:38.020 --> 02:40:40.420]  Again, I used this professionally for a decade.
[02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:46.060]  It is, to not even mention it, it's just sad to me
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:47.260]  that you're not gonna talk about
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:51.320]  the incredible technology advances it has
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:52.440]  just so you can make fun of it,
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:53.900]  what it looks like when it's charging.
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:55.980]  But none of them, also none of them mentioned
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:58.740]  that the Pencil ships with a little thing
[02:40:58.740 --> 02:41:00.100]  so that you can charge it.
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:01.380]  If you don't wanna charge it that way,
[02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:03.540]  cause you think it looks stupid, you can charge it just by,
[02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:06.340]  it's like a male to female adapter
[02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:07.540]  so that you can charge it
[02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:09.700]  by plugging in any other lightning cord.
[02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.500]  Yeah, that's what I use because invariably
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:14.180]  I charge my things at night and then I need to charge both.
[02:41:14.180 --> 02:41:15.460]  And once you've plugged in the iPad,
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:16.860]  you can't plug the Pencil into it too.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:18.180]  So I just get that little dingus
[02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:19.940]  and plug it into the cable next to it.
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:20.760]  Right.
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:25.620]  The better question is why did they design it
[02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:30.540]  the way they did where the built-in charger is a male
[02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:33.760]  that sticks that you would stick into the iPad
[02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:36.060]  and have the Pencil stick out
[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:38.880]  as opposed to making the built-in one a female
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:41.660]  so that you could charge it into any cable anywhere
[02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:43.780]  and then have an adapter to turn it into a male
[02:41:43.780 --> 02:41:46.580]  to do the admittedly looks kind of silly
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:49.820]  when it sticks out of the thing charging.
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:53.220]  And I don't know anybody who is involved
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:54.740]  in the development of the Pencil.
[02:41:54.740 --> 02:41:56.540]  So I say this just as a guess,
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:42:00.780]  but I can't help but think that they debated this thoroughly
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:05.540]  and that the answer is that in a pinch when you're using it
[02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:07.780]  and the Pencil runs out of battery
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:09.060]  and all of a sudden you're tap tap,
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:11.460]  you realize, oh, this is out of battery.
[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:13.300]  The fact that you don't have to worry
[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:14.640]  if you have an adapter with you
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:17.060]  that you can always just plug it into the iPad
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.780]  that you're obviously using right now
[02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:20.780]  because I'm talking about the scenario
[02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:23.020]  of you're in the middle of drawing something
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:25.020]  and the Pencil runs out of battery.
[02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:27.860]  The fact that you can just stick it in no matter what,
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:29.860]  because even if you lose the cap,
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:31.740]  the Pencil has the male adapter.
[02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:34.300]  You stick it in and 15 seconds later,
[02:42:34.300 --> 02:42:37.260]  15 seconds later you have 30 minutes of battery life
[02:42:37.260 --> 02:42:38.100]  on the Pencil.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:42.460]  There's the explanation because otherwise
[02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:47.060]  if they did it the other way, when you run out of power,
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:50.620]  you might not be within spitting distance
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:53.760]  of a lightning cable.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.880]  It's interesting because the assumption
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:57.020]  when a lot of these articles get written
[02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:59.100]  is that Apple is an idiot and they're gonna tell you why
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:01.180]  instead of giving Apple the benefit of the doubt
[02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:03.500]  and especially these teams that have done such great work
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:05.540]  over the years and figuring out why they may have done it
[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:06.660]  the way that they did.
[02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:08.500]  And when you look at all the lightning,
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:10.280]  and it's interesting, all this stuff charges over lightning.
[02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:12.460]  If they need data, they go to USB-C or something else,
[02:43:12.460 --> 02:43:13.620]  but if it's just charged,
[02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:16.260]  they're using lightning across the board right now.
[02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:17.860]  And they're all innies, not outies
[02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:19.340]  with the exception of the Apple Pencil.
[02:43:19.340 --> 02:43:21.600]  So the first question asked is why does it do it that way?
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:23.980]  Not, oh, it's stupid, Apple's doing this,
[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:24.860]  they've lost everything.
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:26.460]  It's why would they make this choice?
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:30.200]  And yeah, you can in 15 seconds get right back to work.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:33.260]  And it also, the Audi is a much smaller package size
[02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:34.760]  and you don't want a little Homer Simpson head
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:37.140]  on the end of your Pencil that you can plug something into.
[02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:39.780]  So it's got two tangible benefits
[02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:41.540]  to making the product that way.
[02:43:41.540 --> 02:43:44.520]  I remember at the actual event itself,
[02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:46.220]  maybe you were there with me, I know we were hanging out,
[02:43:46.220 --> 02:43:48.020]  but at the event when we were watching the demo
[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:50.980]  and it was close to the end, it was at the hands-on area,
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:52.940]  after the event, there's a hands-on area.
[02:43:52.940 --> 02:43:56.940]  And I got introduced to the guy who's the developer
[02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:58.600]  of that 3D drawing app.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:59.440]  What is that?
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:00.280]  YouMake.
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:01.100]  YouMake, which is really,
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:01.940]  I'm gonna put that in the show notes,
[02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:03.460]  a really, really fascinating app.
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:06.500]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:07.340]  You just draw on screen.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:09.340]  Like finger painting with industrial design.
[02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:10.260]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:13.280]  It's like finger painting combined with clay modeling
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:14.820]  to make 3D shapes.
[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:17.580]  And it's like someone at Apple was like,
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:18.460]  hey, you got to meet this guy.
[02:44:18.460 --> 02:44:19.420]  You got to see this app.
[02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:20.540]  We've been working with him.
[02:44:20.540 --> 02:44:21.620]  We were so impressed.
[02:44:21.620 --> 02:44:23.580]  We brought him in early and had him hook it up
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:24.560]  to work for the pencil.
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:25.940]  And he started giving us the demo,
[02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:27.820]  but it was at the end of this hands-on thing.
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:30.140]  And he'd been demoing it nonstop for over an hour
[02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:33.060]  and his pencil ran out and he just goes, oh, hold on.
[02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:35.660]  And he knew he was only gonna give us
[02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.260]  like a three minute demo.
[02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:39.480]  So he didn't even charge it in for 15 seconds.
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:42.340]  It was just, I don't know, five seconds in the port.
[02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:45.020]  And then he pulled it back out and it was back to work.
[02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:48.540]  And in an area where there weren't,
[02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:50.500]  again, there wouldn't have been any lightning cables nearby.
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.980]  It was often the corner of the hands-on area.
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:54.780]  It's incredibly convenient.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:56.180]  I almost always sketch at night.
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:58.860]  I used to sketch all day, every day when I was younger
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:00.020]  and now I have very little time.
[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:02.060]  So I almost always sketch at night and several times
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:03.540]  I go to use the pencil and it's done.
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:05.140]  I plug it in for 15 seconds.
[02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:07.700]  I draw for half an hour, 45 minutes contentedly
[02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:10.420]  and then I just go plug it into the cable and I'm fine.
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:11.260]  Right.
[02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:12.600]  It definitely looks weird
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:13.980]  when it's sticking out of the iPad,
[02:45:13.980 --> 02:45:15.500]  but you don't have to do it for long.
[02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:17.900]  There's absolutely no reason to do it for long
[02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:19.680]  and it's incredibly convenient.
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:22.980]  So it's convenience over elegance.
[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.880]  And that's one of the things,
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:25.640]  like Apple's really good at repercussion modeling.
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:28.260]  They can look at decision A, decision B
[02:45:28.260 --> 02:45:30.340]  and what is the end result of those decisions.
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:31.540]  And I can't help but think that
[02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.700]  if people writing about Apple would spend a few minutes
[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:35.640]  doing that same sort of repercussion modeling,
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:37.760]  we get a much higher level of criticism
[02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:39.100]  in the Apple community.
[02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:42.700]  The fact that the mouse charges on the bottom,
[02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:43.900]  who gives a crap?
[02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:45.460]  That one really gets me.
[02:45:45.460 --> 02:45:46.940]  Who gives a crap?
[02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:48.940]  I mean, it boggles my mind.
[02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:53.660]  Well, the thing is, again,
[02:45:53.660 --> 02:45:54.580]  ask them what would you do differently
[02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:55.580]  while I put it on the back?
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:57.140]  Well, then you have to cut a huge wedge
[02:45:57.140 --> 02:45:58.120]  into the front of the device
[02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:00.220]  and your finger's gonna hit that every time you...
[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:02.940]  So what is the repercussions of moving it to another place?
[02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:04.580]  Right, I actually don't like
[02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:07.420]  the shape of the magic mouse, period.
[02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:11.260]  But as the ATB guys have covered in general,
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:14.380]  it really comes down to how you naturally grip a mouse.
[02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:19.140]  And my mouse grip is just not really amenable
[02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:19.980]  to this design.
[02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:22.500]  But I can see why people who grip it a different way
[02:46:22.500 --> 02:46:24.420]  would really, really like this mouse.
[02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:28.500]  And if you do, you don't want any kind of flat hump,
[02:46:28.500 --> 02:46:30.360]  bump thing on the front of it.
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:31.200]  I mean, it's...
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.020]  And you need a flat plane.
[02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:33.060]  That's why the keyboard and the track pad
[02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:33.900]  can charge in the rear
[02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:36.340]  because they have a flat plane across the back.
[02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:37.180]  Exactly.
[02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:38.700]  And I feel like the fact that they,
[02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:40.660]  well, then they could have put the hole in the side.
[02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:42.080]  Well, then if you put the hole in the side,
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:44.940]  it looks like maybe you could use it while it's charging,
[02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:48.300]  but it's gonna be awkward and ungainly.
[02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:49.540]  And they don't...
[02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:51.140]  It's better to just put it on the bottom and say,
[02:46:51.140 --> 02:46:52.640]  no, don't use it while it's charging.
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:54.060]  And it won't take long to charge.
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:55.040]  And who cares?
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:55.880]  Just plug it in.
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:46:56.700]  You charge it for, again, a few minutes
[02:46:56.700 --> 02:46:57.820]  and you have a day's worth of...
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:46:59.980]  Right, and it looks no worse while it's charging
[02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:01.980]  than the old battery-operated ones.
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:03.220]  Meaning, I know they're all batteries,
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:06.220]  but when you used to have to put AAA batteries in.
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:07.060]  And if you had no battery,
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:09.300]  you had to go to the store and buy it.
[02:47:09.300 --> 02:47:11.180]  It looks no worse while it's charging
[02:47:11.180 --> 02:47:12.500]  than the other one did
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:14.500]  while you were replacing the batteries.
[02:47:15.780 --> 02:47:16.840]  If anything, it looks better
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:18.480]  because it's not missing a panel.
[02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:21.740]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:24.900]  Yeah, and maybe one day Apple will redesign it
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:26.140]  and it will have a design that is conducive
[02:47:26.140 --> 02:47:28.160]  to having a lightning port that works while you're doing it.
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:30.220]  But that would not happen with this design.
[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:32.020]  And this design is what Apple could ship this year.
[02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:33.980]  Exactly, and what they wanted to ship.
[02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:35.120]  Yep.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.500]  The Apple TV remote being symmetric.
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:39.620]  I totally agree with that.
[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:40.980]  There's one where I'm like,
[02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:42.820]  I really wonder what the hell they were thinking.
[02:47:42.820 --> 02:47:44.900]  And I know that once you start feeling the buttons,
[02:47:44.900 --> 02:47:46.740]  you can tell that the volume button
[02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:49.340]  is one big combined capsule shape.
[02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:50.540]  And I've gotten, you know,
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:51.740]  I'm starting to get better at that.
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:54.060]  Siri button is dented, but I think you said this, right?
[02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:54.980]  It's like the home button,
[02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:56.460]  we're just used to having it at the bottom
[02:47:56.460 --> 02:47:58.700]  and we're not used to having a TV set on a home button.
[02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:00.860]  And one has the word menu and the other one has a glyph.
[02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:02.600]  I think the whole thing is odd.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:05.540]  Yeah, I really wish that, I don't know,
[02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:07.580]  I have some, I really wish that the home button
[02:48:07.580 --> 02:48:10.420]  was at the bottom and centered, just like on an iPhone.
[02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:13.740]  And I really wish it was asymmetric in some way,
[02:48:13.740 --> 02:48:15.500]  whether the whole thing is wedge shaped,
[02:48:15.500 --> 02:48:18.720]  sort of like a MacBook Air in profile,
[02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:22.740]  or whether it's the fact that it's not rectangular
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:25.180]  or something, something so that as soon as you pick it up,
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:29.300]  it's absolutely positively, no thinking involved at all.
[02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:30.860]  You know which way it's supposed to go.
[02:48:30.860 --> 02:48:32.100]  And that's not even the biggest issue for me.
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:33.860]  Cause I pick up, I have these other horrible controllers
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:35.220]  for my TV and Blu-ray player.
[02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:36.440]  And they have so many buttons,
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:37.780]  I can't tell what is up and down either.
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:39.700]  So I pick it up and I have to move it around.
[02:48:39.700 --> 02:48:41.660]  But once I have it, I can pretty much find things.
[02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.520]  With this one, because the buttons are symmetrical,
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:44.780]  even when I'm holding it the right way,
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:46.060]  I have to often double check,
[02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:47.020]  is that really the stereo button?
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:48.620]  Is that really the menu button?
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:50.060]  And the home button at the bottom would,
[02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:51.820]  in centered, would make that a no brainer.
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:54.420]  And combine that with the fact that
[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:56.120]  just running your thumb across it
[02:48:56.120 --> 02:48:59.420]  to figure out where the buttons are is inherently,
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:04.080]  I was gonna say destructive, but that's not quite right.
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:06.180]  But it inherently, it makes actual,
[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:10.440]  it makes actions immediately take place with the track pad.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:13.440]  Like you can immediately start going fast forward
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:16.180]  or backwards or pause if you click
[02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:17.580]  by just trying to figure out,
[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:20.900]  is this the touch pad side or the slick bottom side?
[02:49:20.900 --> 02:49:23.340]  But if you guess wrong and touch the track pad side,
[02:49:23.340 --> 02:49:25.960]  something happens to the video stream you're seeing already.
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:27.940]  And I know that the Siri button is indented,
[02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:29.340]  but I have held down that menu button
[02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:31.080]  and spoken to it so many times.
[02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:34.300]  It's, you know, I have to.
[02:49:34.300 --> 02:49:36.180]  Cause you're not supposed to look at it.
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:38.100]  It doesn't seem, it's just,
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:39.980]  it should be designed so you don't have to look at it.
[02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:42.140]  And it's not.
[02:49:42.140 --> 02:49:46.900]  So I would, I will bet that the next time we see
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:49.700]  a new Apple TV, that it'll come with a new remote.
[02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:51.580]  Great remote too, can't wait.
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:53.740]  Yeah, and I really wonder how much of it,
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:55.460]  I know that they must've tested it
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:57.760]  in like real world testing scenarios,
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:59.380]  like a dark room while you're on the couch.
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:01.300]  But I just wonder how much of it is from the fact
[02:50:01.300 --> 02:50:03.760]  that maybe it was designed with the lights on
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:05.580]  and looking at it.
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:07.060]  And also, I mean, there's so much to get right.
[02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:10.300]  Like they spent so much time just adjusting micro increments
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.900]  of getting the swiping gestures right that,
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:14.580]  you know, who knows how much time
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:16.000]  they spent on the buttons.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.500]  Yeah, but there's one where I feel like
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:19.500]  they definitely could have done better.
[02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:20.800]  Absolutely.
[02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:23.500]  MacBook One with only one port.
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:25.540]  Here's one where this is maybe the product that,
[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:27.500]  I guess it's the one that was introduced earliest
[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:31.500]  in the year, where I still feel like we don't really know
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:33.860]  what Apple is thinking there, you know.
[02:50:33.860 --> 02:50:38.220]  Was it an engineering constraint or was it a statement?
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:40.220]  You know, like we just don't think
[02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:43.660]  you should be plugging things into devices anymore.
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:46.460]  I loved Schiller's answer on the talk show after WWC,
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:48.160]  where he said, we wanted to make a MacBook
[02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:50.900]  that had no ports, but, and he didn't say this,
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:52.740]  but up until about October of this year,
[02:50:52.740 --> 02:50:54.700]  you couldn't inductively charge through metal.
[02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:57.220]  A bunch of patents and a bunch of technologies came out
[02:50:57.220 --> 02:50:59.780]  late in the year that started to allow inductive charging
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:01.700]  through metal, but you had to charge through a cable.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:02.900]  So once you have to charge through a cable,
[02:51:02.900 --> 02:51:03.780]  you need one cable.
[02:51:03.780 --> 02:51:05.220]  And then when you have one cable,
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:07.400]  you might as well be as multipurpose a cable as possible.
[02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:10.380]  So we'll use USB-C that has data and has power
[02:51:10.380 --> 02:51:11.940]  and can do all these other things.
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:13.500]  But at the same time, no one went and took away
[02:51:13.500 --> 02:51:15.060]  your MacBook Pro or your MacBook Air.
[02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:16.540]  So if you wanted multiports,
[02:51:16.540 --> 02:51:18.540]  they would very kindly walk you over to the table
[02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:20.340]  in the Apple store that has your multiport
[02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:22.300]  wonder machine waiting for you.
[02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:24.580]  Yeah, there's one, the complaints about that
[02:51:24.580 --> 02:51:27.700]  are more like, it's not that they took away,
[02:51:27.700 --> 02:51:29.500]  again, they didn't take away any of the products
[02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:30.540]  that were already being sold.
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:32.800]  So whatever you did like, you could still buy.
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:35.820]  It's more like they didn't build the next generation machine
[02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:37.060]  that you wanted.
[02:51:37.060 --> 02:51:38.700]  Yes, you wanted a retina MacBook Air
[02:51:38.700 --> 02:51:39.860]  and they didn't give you that.
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:42.500]  Right, and if that's the same sort of thinking
[02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:47.500]  that would have led us to have floppy drives
[02:51:48.660 --> 02:51:53.660]  for another decade or VGA ports for another decade,
[02:51:53.660 --> 02:51:58.660]  which other companies making Wintel notebooks
[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:03.560]  will meet your needs if that's where you're thinking.
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:05.920]  But Apple, you're on the wrong side of the fence
[02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:07.920]  if that's what you want Apple to do.
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:08.760]  And there were concessions here.
[02:52:08.760 --> 02:52:10.240]  I mean, they made the screen so thin
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:11.720]  that they couldn't fit the Z-index
[02:52:11.720 --> 02:52:13.200]  for a decent web camera in there.
[02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:15.220]  They absolutely had some things
[02:52:15.220 --> 02:52:17.360]  were just physical constraints on that.
[02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:18.640]  And some things were economic constraints
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.280]  because they use technology that,
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:22.240]  I don't wanna say from the future
[02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:25.560]  that sounds corny, but it's a very progressive machine
[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:28.120]  and things like the force touch trackpad, it's cool
[02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:30.240]  but it also means a physical mechanism
[02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:32.120]  doesn't have to be under the trackpad anymore.
[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:32.960]  It's just logic.
[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:34.860]  And so they can make that incredibly thin
[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:37.020]  which again translates into lightness.
[02:52:37.020 --> 02:52:39.120]  So I could take this MacBook and like an iPad
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:41.000]  throw it in the inside pocket of my winter jacket
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.280]  and just, I did that the other day
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:43.780]  and just went to the coffee shop with it.
[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:46.200]  It has almost no appreciable weight.
[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:49.560]  Yeah, so I really can't see that
[02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:51.400]  as indicative of bad design.
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:54.320]  I would see this, the MacBook is indicative
[02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:59.320]  of significantly different ordering of priorities.
[02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:01.880]  And I felt like all our friends had these handfuls
[02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:03.720]  of adapters on Twitter all the time.
[02:53:03.720 --> 02:53:04.920]  And I just really wanted,
[02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:06.280]  that's not the computer for you.
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:09.040]  It's okay, it's a computer for somebody else.
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:14.000]  You really, it's okay if you want a MacBook Pro.
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.140]  Absolutely, I love the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[02:53:16.140 --> 02:53:17.900]  It's got the force touch trackpad too.
[02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:20.540]  It is a great machine for anybody who wants to have tons
[02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:22.840]  and tons of ports and accessories and things.
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:29.640]  I think that more or less covers my list.
[02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:31.380]  Anything else you wanted to talk about?
[02:53:31.380 --> 02:53:33.080]  Just the end of the year stuff
[02:53:33.080 --> 02:53:36.040]  which is Williams, Schiller and Shiroji's new roles
[02:53:36.040 --> 02:53:38.000]  which we kind of mentioned obliquely at the beginning.
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:41.400]  Yeah, well, we mentioned Williams.
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:44.020]  Shiroji really, I really think,
[02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:45.240]  and you know this more than I do,
[02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:46.280]  you're better at sourcing,
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:47.700]  but it's really not a promotion.
[02:53:47.700 --> 02:53:50.520]  It's a recognition of where he already, you know,
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:51.480]  what did you, how did you put it?
[02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:53.320]  You do the work first and then you get the promotion.
[02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:55.200]  Yeah, and there were so many people who were surprised
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:58.280]  that he, like, they just assumed he was an SVP already.
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:54:00.680]  Right, right, like that wasn't official.
[02:54:00.680 --> 02:54:03.200]  The part that maybe we don't know the answer to
[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.960]  is the Schiller taking over, you know,
[02:54:05.960 --> 02:54:08.700]  being named as being responsible for the App Store.
[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:10.080]  Yeah.
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:14.040]  Which I don't think is.
[02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:16.840]  And again, you know, we're not in a position to know
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:19.040]  and the number of people who are is very, very few
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:20.340]  and they're not going to talk about it.
[02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:25.340]  But whether it's seen as a gentle demotion of it for Eddie Q,
[02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:29.200]  I don't think so, but it did require,
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:32.320]  I mean, technically it did require his bio to be rewritten
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.000]  such that he's no longer listed
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.420]  as being in charge of the App Stores.
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:37.760]  Yeah, I mean, it's really interesting.
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:39.740]  And again, a lot of this is technical detail.
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.600]  Like the App Store still runs on iTunes.
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:43.440]  Those servers are not being physically moved
[02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:45.700]  into Phil Schiller's office and the infrastructure
[02:54:45.700 --> 02:54:47.360]  and the backend CMS.
[02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:48.860]  All the things that run the App Store,
[02:54:48.860 --> 02:54:51.000]  that's all still iTunes plumbing.
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:52.560]  And that's not being moved over.
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:54.680]  What's being moved over is things like store management
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:58.800]  and editorial, which are just historically
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:01.120]  has been part of Eddie's work because that's what he ran
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:04.040]  as part of the music and the movie business and the podcast,
[02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:06.080]  which have had editors and store managers
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:08.160]  since the inception of that business.
[02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:09.860]  Right, and some things like the stuff
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:12.240]  that's clearly developer relations
[02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:15.960]  has always been under Schiller,
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:20.020]  which would be an App Store review.
[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:20.860]  Yes.
[02:55:20.860 --> 02:55:24.000]  App Store review, like it is kind of crazy.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.860]  And like you said, I think it's really just the way
[02:55:25.860 --> 02:55:30.480]  that this evolved out of going back to 2008,
[02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:33.500]  when it was like, well, we've already got the iTunes store.
[02:55:33.500 --> 02:55:34.820]  And if we're gonna do an App Store,
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:36.280]  we can build it on top of that.
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:37.660]  And we've already got the credit cards
[02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.700]  and people already have accounts and we already know,
[02:55:39.700 --> 02:55:43.300]  we already have the content distribution networks.
[02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.400]  We already have all of this.
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.260]  And so you go from there to here
[02:55:46.260 --> 02:55:47.680]  and you're left with a scenario
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:49.960]  where the person who's in charge of developer relations,
[02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:54.160]  which was Schiller, wasn't in charge of App Store editorial.
[02:55:54.160 --> 02:55:55.000]  Yep.
[02:55:55.840 --> 02:55:57.800]  Because he's not in charge of movies editorial
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:55:59.040]  or in charge of podcast editorial.
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:00.440]  But it never would have been like that
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:03.320]  if it had been designed from the ground up as a new thing.
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:07.980]  If they had, instead of building it on top of iTunes,
[02:56:07.980 --> 02:56:11.000]  the iTunes music, what was once just the iTunes music store,
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.240]  if they hadn't built from what started as that,
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:14.760]  it never would have been under Ed EQ
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:16.200]  in the first place, I don't think.
[02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:18.620]  Yeah, and it led to a lot of issues.
[02:56:18.620 --> 02:56:22.640]  For example, famously last year where Extensibility came up
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:25.320]  from Craig Federighi's organization,
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:26.760]  from software engineering.
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:29.600]  Great feature and it gets announced and it comes out.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.200]  And because when new features launch,
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:33.060]  when a new version of iOS launches, it's a madhouse.
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:34.920]  There's so many apps to review that they,
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:36.880]  if they do not crash and they're not detected
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:38.440]  to have any malware, they just go out.
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:40.640]  And then anything that has got passed through review
[02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:42.340]  is allowed to be featured by editorial.
[02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:45.420]  There's no if, ands, or buts, it's a binary state.
[02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:46.960]  This app is approved, we can feature it
[02:56:46.960 --> 02:56:48.200]  if we think it's a great app.
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:49.840]  So they go through and feature all these things.
[02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:51.160]  And that again is in Eddy's org.
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:53.520]  And then later when things calm down,
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:54.880]  everybody has time to say, well,
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:57.520]  this is not exactly the experience that we wanted.
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:00.880]  We didn't want anybody to put a calculator in widget space
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:03.040]  because there's so high a RAM constraint.
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:04.580]  There's such a big potential for crashes.
[02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:07.240]  We don't think the average developer has the engineering,
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:08.980]  like they don't know it's James Thompson who wrote,
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:10.000]  you know, the doc or something.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:11.960]  It's just the average developer will not be able
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:13.240]  to make a good app experience here.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:16.000]  So we'd rather not open that up as a possibility
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:16.840]  and they reject it.
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:18.160]  They can't have a rule that says,
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:19.640]  if you're as good as James Thompson,
[02:57:19.640 --> 02:57:21.760]  you can write a calculator for the widget view.
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:23.680]  And if you're not, you can't.
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:24.740]  That's not enforceable.
[02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:26.200]  And they don't know because they haven't made
[02:57:26.200 --> 02:57:27.200]  thousands of widget apps.
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:29.000]  They've made one or two internally to test on.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:29.920]  And that's not a big sub.
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:32.240]  So then after a while, they see that this is great.
[02:57:32.240 --> 02:57:34.500]  It's got obvious benefits and they go and rewrite the rule.
[02:57:34.500 --> 02:57:37.260]  And that might actually be, it's a horribly ugly process
[02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:39.560]  and it makes Apple look like they don't communicate.
[02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:41.800]  And it creates a lot of concern for developers,
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:44.060]  but it gets, in a matter of two weeks,
[02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:45.720]  you have this fundamental change in the app store
[02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:48.160]  that otherwise might take a whole revision of iOS
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:49.320]  before you get to.
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:51.760]  Yeah, my hope though is that it's also a sign
[02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:54.640]  and not just that it's a more logical place
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:59.360]  in the org structure for app stores in general to be.
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:02.540]  But my other sincere hope though, is that Schiller,
[02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:06.340]  because he cares about this stuff and I know that he does,
[02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:09.620]  that he will make it a high enough priority
[02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:11.500]  that it will improve in ways
[02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:14.920]  that I think it very clearly needs to improve.
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:16.500]  Yeah, there's some things that are like,
[02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.980]  anything that's infrastructure based,
[02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:20.020]  if people had complaints about the lack of analytics
[02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:22.720]  or the lack, or how bad iTunes Connect worked,
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:25.020]  or the lack of resources being given to Mac App Store
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:26.300]  because they weren't at parity,
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:27.940]  that's all under EdiQ because that's his team
[02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:29.060]  that does all that.
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:30.900]  But App Review was under Phil Schiller.
[02:58:30.900 --> 02:58:32.700]  And if you complained about the rejections
[02:58:32.700 --> 02:58:34.680]  or about developer relations, that was all on him.
[02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:36.260]  But then there's this middle ground,
[02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:38.000]  like who is in charge of upgrades
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:39.500]  and who is in charge of trials?
[02:58:39.500 --> 02:58:42.380]  And that was split across several people.
[02:58:42.380 --> 02:58:43.340]  Someone had to make the feature,
[02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:45.200]  someone had to agree, it was a great,
[02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:46.740]  there was just a lot of confusion.
[02:58:46.740 --> 02:58:47.740]  Maybe confusion is the wrong word,
[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:50.380]  but there was no clear authority on that.
[02:58:50.380 --> 02:58:51.860]  And one of the things that I've been asking for
[02:58:51.860 --> 02:58:53.900]  for a long time is just a clear VP of App Store.
[02:58:53.900 --> 02:58:56.600]  And now it's even better, there's an SVP of App Store.
[02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:58.260]  And a lot of the people now are aligned
[02:58:58.260 --> 02:59:00.940]  straight under Phil and hopefully,
[02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:02.260]  there's still gonna be a hard time.
[02:59:02.260 --> 02:59:03.140]  You get a new engineer,
[02:59:03.140 --> 02:59:04.460]  are you gonna put them on Mac App Store
[02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:06.620]  when there's 800 things to be done on the iOS App Store
[02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:07.780]  where all your money is?
[02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:09.180]  That takes an executive who's gonna say,
[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:10.060]  this is important enough
[02:59:10.060 --> 02:59:12.600]  that I'm gonna expend those resources in a business
[02:59:12.600 --> 02:59:14.700]  that doesn't make as much money.
[02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:17.380]  Or they're gonna say, I know that we're making a fortune
[02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:19.140]  and everyone, Zynga's super happy
[02:59:19.140 --> 02:59:20.540]  and Crandy Crush is super happy
[02:59:20.540 --> 02:59:22.700]  and Clash of Clans is super happy.
[02:59:22.700 --> 02:59:25.540]  But we have a legacy, we believe that this stuff is valuable,
[02:59:25.540 --> 02:59:27.220]  that quantity is not what matters anymore,
[02:59:27.220 --> 02:59:28.380]  quality is what matters.
[02:59:28.380 --> 02:59:29.660]  And we're gonna make it our business
[02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:31.580]  to make sustainable apps for any developers
[02:59:31.580 --> 02:59:33.140]  because we believe that they're crucial.
[02:59:33.140 --> 02:59:35.300]  That takes someone, a single person
[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:37.040]  like a Phil Schiller to drive through.
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:40.980]  Yeah, and I really hope that that's a sign of it.
[02:59:40.980 --> 02:59:43.300]  And that's how I'm taking that part
[02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:45.300]  of the year-end executive news.
[02:59:48.820 --> 02:59:49.980]  I don't know what else to call it
[02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:51.700]  because again, it's not really a reshuffling.
[02:59:51.700 --> 02:59:54.460]  Maybe the only thing that got shuffled is the App Store.
[02:59:54.460 --> 02:59:57.160]  And even there, it was really more that it got clarified
[02:59:57.160 --> 02:59:59.380]  that okay, this is something that deserves
[02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:01.460]  to be under one person,
[03:00:01.460 --> 03:00:05.900]  not split across several organizations.
[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:07.740]  And I think internally, people would argue
[03:00:07.740 --> 03:00:10.140]  and I don't think it's building a secret
[03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:11.820]  to say that Eddie and Phil have different opinions
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.100]  on things, they're different people.
[03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:15.260]  But it was sort of tacitly known that Phil Schiller,
[03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:16.580]  if he cared enough about something,
[03:00:16.580 --> 03:00:18.860]  he would be the sort of like the final word on things.
[03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:20.900]  And now it's official the same way Craig Federighi
[03:00:20.900 --> 03:00:25.180]  has iOS and OS X and Angela Aronis has retail and online.
[03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:28.140]  Tim Cook has been consistently making,
[03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:32.000]  and then that's where Johnny Ive has all the ID and HI.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.540]  Tim Cook has been making Apple sort of more combined,
[03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:37.180]  more clear in their organization.
[03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:38.420]  And this feels like something
[03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:39.700]  that should have happened a long time ago.
[03:00:39.700 --> 03:00:41.100]  It's something that needed to happen.
[03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:44.380]  Yeah, and I wonder whether it's just,
[03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:46.780]  maybe it was at the store, was this planned all along
[03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:48.780]  or was like the straw that broke the camel's back,
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:52.780]  the weird Mac App Store signing.
[03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:56.780]  We switched SSL versions and broke a whole bunch of stuff.
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:00:59.260]  And was that the straw that broke the camel's back?
[03:00:59.260 --> 03:01:00.100]  I think it's a lot.
[03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:00.940]  Yeah, it's a lot of things.
[03:01:00.940 --> 03:01:03.020]  Because that again, when you look at it in isolation,
[03:01:03.020 --> 03:01:03.860]  it makes sense.
[03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:05.340]  They moved to a new certificate early
[03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:07.740]  and people were using such old versions of OpenSSL
[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:12.740]  that it didn't work with, what is it, SHA?
[03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:16.100]  SHA-2 or whatever, SHA-2.
[03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:17.300]  The details don't matter.
[03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:18.380]  No, no, absolutely.
[03:01:18.380 --> 03:01:20.860]  It really just was, it never should have happened.
[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:23.020]  And it's funny, I'm still running into it.
[03:01:23.020 --> 03:01:26.060]  I just launched an app that I use very infrequently.
[03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:27.740]  I just launched it the other day
[03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:31.340]  and I ran into the, now you have to sign into the App Store
[03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:33.740]  again, just to launch this app.
[03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:35.460]  I opened my MacBook Pro for the first time
[03:01:35.460 --> 03:01:38.300]  in a month and a half and I hadn't rebooted.
[03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:41.300]  I hadn't upgraded to all those apps were failing on me.
[03:01:42.300 --> 03:01:43.940]  The thing that, to go back to your point previously
[03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:45.300]  about none of these things are easy though.
[03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:47.300]  I mean, I don't want to say it's easy,
[03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:49.300]  but we can all say we want upgrades.
[03:01:49.300 --> 03:01:51.300]  But at some point someone has to implement it
[03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:54.300]  or they want trials and then you have to answer the questions.
[03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:56.300]  How long is a trial?
[03:01:56.300 --> 03:01:58.300]  If I download the app but don't try it immediately,
[03:01:58.300 --> 03:01:59.300]  can I try it later?
[03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:01.300]  If I try it but get distracted, can I go back to it?
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:04.300]  If I delete it and download it, can I try it again?
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:06.300]  If I input a bunch of data and the trial runs out,
[03:02:06.300 --> 03:02:07.300]  can I extract my data?
[03:02:07.300 --> 03:02:09.300]  Because that's my personal information.
[03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:11.300]  There's all sorts of questions that have to be answered,
[03:02:11.300 --> 03:02:14.300]  but it felt like that process hadn't necessarily
[03:02:14.300 --> 03:02:17.300]  been started or at least not fully explored.
[03:02:17.300 --> 03:02:20.300]  And hopefully now when you go down the line of those different things
[03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:22.300]  that people want from the App Store,
[03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:24.300]  at least maybe there's a chance that they'll be reconsidered.
[03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:27.300]  Couldn't say it better myself.
[03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:30.300]  Anything else?
[03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:33.300]  No, I mean, Apple Pay expanded.
[03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:35.300]  The other thing I think is smaller.
[03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:38.300]  It's coming to China next year, which is going to be a big deal.
[03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:42.300]  What do you think, all right, last but not least,
[03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:46.300]  a year from now when we're doing this for 2016,
[03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:49.300]  is it going to be easier or harder or about the same?
[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:52.300]  I don't think it's going to get any easier.
[03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:54.300]  I think Apple is growing.
[03:02:54.300 --> 03:02:56.300]  And it sounds silly to say that the world's biggest company is growing,
[03:02:56.300 --> 03:02:58.300]  but they absolutely are.
[03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:01.300]  And we're going to get the iPhone 7 next year,
[03:03:01.300 --> 03:03:03.300]  and it's going to be a redesign.
[03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:06.300]  The iPad Air 3 is probably imminent by now.
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:08.300]  We're going to have whatever the next generation...
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:09.300]  Yeah, the new Apple.
[03:03:09.300 --> 03:03:11.300]  There's going to be a lot of stuff, and there's going to be...
[03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:14.300]  We didn't even talk about Jeff Williams and his medical...
[03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:16.300]  He's running medical for Apple stuff too,
[03:03:16.300 --> 03:03:19.300]  which could turn into something else entirely.
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:21.300]  And who knows what we don't know about Apple,
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:23.300]  because they try out a whole bunch of different things.
[03:03:23.300 --> 03:03:25.300]  They have their eye on a lot of different industries.
[03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:27.300]  So I think next year, I don't think we'll get the...
[03:03:27.300 --> 03:03:31.300]  This year was unusual in that we got not just two kind of new products,
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:33.300]  but two whole new app stores, and that just doesn't happen.
[03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:37.300]  So I don't think we'll have the same breadth of stuff next year,
[03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:39.300]  but I think we will get the next version of all this stuff.
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:42.300]  Yeah, my guess is that we'll spend a lot less time
[03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:45.300]  talking about new products that you can actually hold in your hand,
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:51.300]  and more time talking about new integration, software-wise.
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:54.300]  It'll be a little bit more of a nebulous discussion,
[03:03:54.300 --> 03:03:58.300]  but more along the lines of HealthKit and stuff like that,
[03:03:58.300 --> 03:04:04.300]  and integrating the way that all of these things work together.
[03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:05.300]  Handoff for iTunes.
[03:04:05.300 --> 03:04:07.300]  There's so much things that they could be working on.
[03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:09.300]  Guest mode for the iPhone.
[03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:11.300]  What if they're going to switch to OLED displays,
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:13.300]  and they're going to need night mode for that because it's conservative?
[03:04:13.300 --> 03:04:16.300]  There's so many interesting things coming up.
[03:04:16.300 --> 03:04:18.300]  Yeah. Well, thank you, Rene.
[03:04:18.300 --> 03:04:21.300]  There is also, and if you haven't heard enough about this year in review,
[03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:29.300]  there is a giant feature at the iMore year in review,
[03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:32.300]  where it links back to just about everything you guys did
[03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:33.300]  covering all this along the way.
[03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:36.300]  I'll put that in the show notes.
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:37.300]  What podcasts are you on?
[03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:39.300]  What do you want people who like your voice?
[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:40.300]  Where can they hear more?
[03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:43.300]  I do a podcast with little-known Montreal celebrity Guy English
[03:04:43.300 --> 03:04:44.300]  called Debug.
[03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:48.300]  We just had Nitin Ganatra, Don Melton, and their box of wine back on,
[03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:52.300]  and they talked about management at Apple and retention,
[03:04:52.300 --> 03:04:56.300]  which is a follow-up to a show that Michael Lopp did with us
[03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:59.300]  a couple weeks ago on similar issues.
[03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:01.300]  To me, you've linked to Guy several times on that.
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:03.300]  To me, that's one of the most interesting topics about Apple now,
[03:05:03.300 --> 03:05:06.300]  is how they manage their assets and how they retain their people.
[03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:07.300]  Absolutely.
[03:05:07.300 --> 03:05:10.300]  Guy said it years ago, just plainly, clearly,
[03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:13.300]  that post Steve Jobs, the number one problem facing Apple
[03:05:13.300 --> 03:05:15.300]  is retention of talent.
[03:05:15.300 --> 03:05:18.300]  I don't think it has become a problem,
[03:05:18.300 --> 03:05:20.300]  and I don't think it's gone bad,
[03:05:20.300 --> 03:05:26.300]  but I think it remains the single biggest problem.
[03:05:26.300 --> 03:05:29.300]  One way we're seeing it, and I know that you've heard this,
[03:05:29.300 --> 03:05:35.300]  is the way that Project Titan is the car, apparently.
[03:05:35.300 --> 03:05:40.300]  What we think is taking in so many talented engineers
[03:05:40.300 --> 03:05:44.300]  from across the company that it's created internal conflict of,
[03:05:44.300 --> 03:05:47.300]  come on, you cannot keep taking people who are working on things
[03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:50.300]  that are just trying to improve what's already there.
[03:05:50.300 --> 03:05:53.300]  There's tension in the company.
[03:05:53.300 --> 03:05:59.300]  The car people cannot take all of our A talent going forward.
[03:05:59.300 --> 03:06:01.300]  Which is interesting because most people haven't spoken about the car
[03:06:01.300 --> 03:06:03.300]  in terms of a software stack yet,
[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:05.300]  and that's probably one of the most interesting parts about it.
[03:06:05.300 --> 03:06:06.300]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:09.300]  But it's also interesting to think that as Apple expands and does more products
[03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:13.300]  that retention can be a problem not necessarily for the company
[03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:16.300]  because let's say you have an A talent engineer
[03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:22.300]  and she leaves from working on...
[03:06:22.300 --> 03:06:25.300]  Working on UI kit and going to watch, for example.
[03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:29.300]  Right, or going to the kernel of the operating system for the car
[03:06:29.300 --> 03:06:30.300]  or something like that.
[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:32.300]  Well, Apple hasn't lost any talent,
[03:06:32.300 --> 03:06:36.300]  but the iOS has, right?
[03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:38.300]  So it's interesting to think of talent retention
[03:06:38.300 --> 03:06:40.300]  not necessarily being a company-wide product
[03:06:40.300 --> 03:06:42.300]  but being a problem,
[03:06:42.300 --> 03:06:46.300]  but a problem for just the existing products as opposed to the new.
[03:06:46.300 --> 03:06:48.300]  And it's funny because with Steve Jobs and the iPhone
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:50.300]  it was you can only take internal people.
[03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:52.300]  We're not going to trust anybody else with this.
[03:06:52.300 --> 03:06:54.300]  And now with the watch and now with the car
[03:06:54.300 --> 03:06:56.300]  it's like you can have some of them,
[03:06:56.300 --> 03:06:58.300]  but we're going to fight you on the others.
[03:06:58.300 --> 03:07:00.300]  Right, so I think that's super interesting.
[03:07:00.300 --> 03:07:05.300]  I also want to thank the four sponsors we had for the show today.
[03:07:05.300 --> 03:07:09.300]  The Brower Group who do the U-Bar
[03:07:09.300 --> 03:07:13.300]  and their new Mirage mechanical watches.
[03:07:13.300 --> 03:07:16.300]  Hello with their Hello Pillows.
[03:07:16.300 --> 03:07:18.300]  HelloPillow.com slash talk show.
[03:07:18.300 --> 03:07:22.300]  Automatic, the smart dingus for your car.
[03:07:22.300 --> 03:07:28.300]  And Harry's high quality razors, blades and shaving products.
[03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:29.300]  Rene, thank you.
[03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:31.300]  Thank you so much. Happy New Year.
[03:07:31.300 --> 03:08:00.300]  May the force be with you.
