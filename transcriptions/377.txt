[00:00.000 --> 00:02.720]  Guy, it's been a very long time since you've been on the show.
[00:02.720 --> 00:07.520]  It has, man. I don't... I'm not sure. I don't remember the last time I was on your show.
[00:07.520 --> 00:10.240]  Oh, but it was probably a Star Wars thing with Syracuse.
[00:10.240 --> 00:15.520]  Yeah, I think... I forget what the topic was, but I think it was not this January, but last January.
[00:15.520 --> 00:17.200]  So, time flies.
[00:17.840 --> 00:22.080]  Because at one point we were doing Star Wars movies every year when they would come out.
[00:22.080 --> 00:28.480]  And I think our review of Rise of Skywalker is wrapped up perfectly by us just not...
[00:28.480 --> 00:33.680]  Not only not doing a show, you didn't even text Syracuse and I. It's not like...
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.840]  It's just like, nobody cared. Nobody cared to touch that. It just left it.
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.960]  It pops up on the Mastodon and Twitter and wherever people make suggestions for who should
[00:42.960 --> 00:47.520]  be on the show. And it comes up, hey, how about doing a Star Wars to wrap it up?
[00:48.640 --> 00:56.000]  I will say, I mean, this is not the Rise of Skywalker episode, which may or may not ever
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.960]  exist. I will say this, I was so unhappy with that movie that I've literally only seen it once,
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.280]  which I believe... I'm pretty sure I went to see it opening night. I know it was in the theater
[01:05.280 --> 01:11.600]  and I know it was at least opening weekend. And we watched it and we walked out and
[01:12.720 --> 01:15.040]  I haven't seen it again. I haven't seen it again.
[01:17.520 --> 01:24.560]  Oh, all of a sudden the guy who died 20 years ago is still alive and he built 10,000
[01:24.560 --> 01:29.760]  Star Destroyers and hit them all on a planet and what is it?
[01:29.760 --> 01:33.040]  I mean, it's not like Star Wars often makes a lot of sense.
[01:33.040 --> 01:35.680]  Yeah, but that's anti-sense though.
[01:35.680 --> 01:36.240]  Exactly.
[01:36.240 --> 01:42.240]  Yeah, right. There's rules in a fantasy setting. They're not realistic rules, but you create rules
[01:42.240 --> 01:46.400]  and 10,000 hidden Star Destroyers is not one.
[01:46.400 --> 01:50.880]  Yeah, with beams that blow up planets. Anyway, whatever. Skip that. We're falling into the chat,
[01:50.880 --> 01:51.520]  man. Forget the...
[01:51.520 --> 01:58.240]  Yeah, here's the better reason to have you on this week preceding WWDC 2023
[01:59.280 --> 02:07.680]  is that I've got my live show coming up, I guess not a week from today. It'll be a week from today
[02:07.680 --> 02:12.720]  as the show airs tomorrow, but a week from tomorrow as we record on the 30th.
[02:13.360 --> 02:17.760]  So get that out of the way. Everybody listening, if you haven't seen me announce it on Daring
[02:17.760 --> 02:25.280]  Fireball tickets are available. It'll be Wednesday, June 7th back at the very lovely. I mean that
[02:25.280 --> 02:29.920]  no sarcasm. It's a wonderful, wonderful theater in California Theater in San Jose, the big
[02:30.720 --> 02:37.920]  1100 seat old theater in San Jose on Wednesday of WWDC week at 5 o'clock. Tickets are available,
[02:38.560 --> 02:43.520]  selling briskly, probably going to be sold out soon, but probably not by the time the show airs.
[02:43.520 --> 02:48.000]  So anybody who wants tickets, go there and get them. But going down memory lane,
[02:49.120 --> 02:59.600]  you were my guest on the live episode from WWDC 10 years ago. That's 2013, which was the year
[03:00.640 --> 03:08.320]  the Mac Pro... What do we call that Mac Pro? Colloquially known the trash can. That's a shame.
[03:08.320 --> 03:13.440]  I really, I don't like calling it. I knew that that's what we were going to wind up calling it,
[03:13.440 --> 03:21.360]  but yeah. I mean, it looks like a trash can, which is fine. So I think, yes. So we were on stage
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.760]  there. We had Scott Simpson and Amy and Paul Kaposas was up there too. It was a good gang.
[03:25.760 --> 03:31.120]  This was prior to you getting great guests. You were like making do with me and Scott.
[03:31.120 --> 03:39.920]  Well, it shows how time has changed. Not that I wouldn't love to have you on stage with me
[03:39.920 --> 03:42.960]  either, but I do believe... Oh man, that would be such a disappointment.
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.000]  I heard Jason lick. I haven't heard the most recent episode, but Jason was saying just him
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.720]  and Moltz on stage. I would love that. That would be great. Those are my favorite people. But whoever,
[03:53.280 --> 03:58.880]  if you ever run dry for like execs at Apple execs or anything, or anybody interesting,
[03:58.880 --> 04:04.160]  and you end up with me and Moltz on stage, there's going to be somehow tomatoes are going to like
[04:04.160 --> 04:07.520]  manifest themselves and just get whipped at the stage. It's going to be, it's going to be
[04:07.520 --> 04:14.720]  horrible. We had nothing but a let down. I'm trying to think. I think that the first one
[04:14.720 --> 04:22.640]  where I had an Apple exec was 2015. I think that's the, I think that's the I shit you not
[04:22.640 --> 04:29.200]  Phil Schiller, where it went from live shows in a mezzanine. I forget how many people's
[04:29.200 --> 04:35.840]  that place fit. It was weird because it actually had a mezzanine. No, it was 100 or 150 downstairs
[04:35.840 --> 04:40.400]  in front of the stage. But the reason that the place was called mezzanine is it had a mezzanine
[04:40.400 --> 04:46.160]  and it was like, and they, some of the seats were obstructed, but they had big TVs that had a live
[04:46.160 --> 04:51.280]  feed so that people could see it. It was pretty big. It was, I was thinking of Mina, like a
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.520]  one 11 minute maybe. Yeah. One 11 minute was like the first couple of years. And that place was only
[04:55.520 --> 05:00.240]  like a hundred people or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. No, mezzanine was impressive. Like
[05:00.240 --> 05:04.480]  you could actually pack a room, which knowing you surprises me, I guess. I don't know.
[05:07.680 --> 05:12.800]  Isn't that interesting? I don't know, but yeah, no, that's great. And again, I heard you talking
[05:12.800 --> 05:17.680]  to Jason that WWDC is not bringing the same number, sheer number of people, Sarah, for the
[05:17.680 --> 05:24.480] , like 5,000 about when it was up in SF and like past couple of years being, I don't know how many
[05:24.480 --> 05:30.080]  like apples got 500, maybe a few hundred in. I'm not sure. But yeah, I'm, I'm confident you're
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.000]  going to sell out. I don't know how the tickets are going. Get them on up. I think I'm looking
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  at the, at the history of it. So 2013 was you and Scott. I forget who else, but, and then the next
[05:40.000 --> 05:49.040]  year was the, was the ATP gang. I had Marco, John Syracuse, and what's the third guy's name. Casey,
[05:49.040 --> 05:54.080]  Casey lists. That's it. That's it. I mean, sort of into Casey. I'm mean enough to Casey.
[05:55.280 --> 06:01.360]  It is. Cause I've even had him on the show. I know, I know. He really holds that show
[06:01.360 --> 06:05.760]  together. He's not that he's the rug from the big Lebowski, but he's like, yeah, he does a good job.
[06:05.760 --> 06:13.360]  But anyway, we did 2013. You were on stage and the big news of the week at that WWDC was the
[06:13.360 --> 06:21.920]  then brand new Mac pro, which was doomed in some ways. But I think it's an interesting place to
[06:21.920 --> 06:26.400]  start because while everybody is headset, headset, headset, headset for next week,
[06:26.400 --> 06:33.680]  and we'll get to that. I mean, it's unavoidable at this point, but I think we're going to get a
[06:33.680 --> 06:41.360]  Mac pro announcement too. I don't know if it's going to go on sale because the last time when
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.560]  they did the last Intel one, the one where they brought back the big case and the thousand dollar
[06:46.560 --> 06:53.040]  wheels that you could put it on the Syracuse, a special, right? That was WWDC 2019, the last
[06:53.040 --> 07:00.240]  pre pandemic WWDC. They introduced that and it wasn't on sale yet. It was, I don't think it went
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.720]  on sale till like late November, December. They were like later this year, this is coming, but
[07:04.720 --> 07:10.560]  here's what it's going to look like. We've got one that everybody here at WWDC can come and look at,
[07:10.560 --> 07:17.600]  but not touch. They were like, don't touch it. Remember? Yeah. They had like an actual last case
[07:17.600 --> 07:22.400]  or was it just like, no, they didn't put it in a glass case like the iPhone years and years ago.
[07:23.440 --> 07:28.320]  They did have a very big security guard there all at all times to make sure nobody touched it.
[07:28.320 --> 07:35.040]  Also, that was where they debuted the, what do they call it? The studio display XDR or just
[07:35.040 --> 07:40.800]  pro display XDR. Studio display is the consumer price thing. And yeah, it's the expensive one.
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.800]  Which I love. I know you love yours too. Like I'm completely happy with it.
[07:44.800 --> 07:47.040]  Well, I don't have the XDR. I have the studio display.
[07:47.040 --> 07:51.200]  No, that's what I mean. Yeah. I think you've got the nanotech. What are they called?
[07:51.200 --> 07:57.520]  The nanotexture display. I have to do a year with it review because I love it so much.
[07:57.520 --> 08:04.720]  And the nanotexture is like magic in my, at certain times of the year,
[08:05.520 --> 08:12.240]  otherwise unusable desk location in my office. Like until I got this display. No, it's,
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.320]  I'm very serious. And I know which time. It's April and October, right? I know it's April
[08:18.320 --> 08:24.400]  cause I just got through it. May, June, July, August, September, October. Yeah. Six months.
[08:24.400 --> 08:30.160]  So every six months, April and October, the sun comes through my office in the middle of
[08:30.160 --> 08:37.600]  the afternoon, which is my prime working hours. And like Raiders of the lost Ark, like, like,
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.160]  like Indiana Jones is down there with the headpiece to the staff of raw on top of the
[08:42.160 --> 08:48.240]  stick. And the sun comes through and hits it and shows the location of the map room.
[08:48.240 --> 08:54.880]  It Tannis somehow just follows your cursor. That is for like two weeks in April and two
[08:54.880 --> 09:00.480]  weeks in October. That is how the sun hits my display. And prior to owning the studio display
[09:00.480 --> 09:06.000]  XTR, I would just work in the kitchen for two hours. I would just take my laptop and
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.600]  do something else. And with the nanotexture display, I literally don't even notice at times
[09:13.600 --> 09:19.120]  until it's like my neck gets hot because the sun's hitting my neck and I'm like, holy
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.680]  shit. Is that how bright the sun is? And I hold my hand up and I, it, it, that is how
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.880]  much the nanotexture lets me work. I don't even notice that the sun is hitting the screen.
[09:28.880 --> 09:34.160]  Anyway, that's my mini review of that. Here's the thing I teed you up for that. Cause
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.280]  we were over your place around Christmas time and you showed me your office and you were,
[09:39.280 --> 09:43.520]  you did this basically not word for word, but you did this little skit of like, yeah, the
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.960]  sun hits it and you show me the window where it comes in from. Oh, the nanotexture. I,
[09:48.960 --> 09:53.760]  yeah, I love mine. I think it's great. Like the pro thing I think is fundamentally the
[09:53.760 --> 09:59.760]  pro display is a pro display. I think it's almost. Foolish to buy it for yourself. I
[09:59.760 --> 10:04.160]  know Marco and Suik is that that's a different thing. Whenever they want to review it,
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.080]  there's reasons for it. But I do think that it's, there's diminishing returns for anybody
[10:08.080 --> 10:13.280]  beyond the studios display, which I find really great. The camera is even fine. I don't really
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.600]  have a major complaint. Could they make a better camera? Sure. But whatever. I don't care that
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.800]  much. I'm there for the screen. So yeah. And the speakers are great too. I mean,
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.760]  I know they're not great. Great. But they're better than anything I've had on my desktop.
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.160]  I think since I had those, remember the sound sticks from yeah. Wait, were they Bose?
[10:34.160 --> 10:39.200]  Bose sound sticks? Yeah. I think that little alien looking pod for the base thing and like the
[10:39.200 --> 10:44.080]  transparent plastic. Yeah. So at least since then, which was a very long time ago and those
[10:44.080 --> 10:48.240]  were actually Amy's and she took them back from me at some point, but it's the best sound I've
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.520]  had at my desktop since then too. Anyway. Oh, also I will just add, I'll spoil my whole review.
[10:53.520 --> 10:59.520]  The other big complaint people had is because the studio display is in fact an iOS device
[10:59.520 --> 11:05.680]  that occasionally gets software updates and requires a weird reboot cycle. And a year ago,
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.960]  when it first came out, like every six weeks required like a power cycling and it had no
[11:10.960 --> 11:19.040]  power button. And therefore I had to like climb under my desk and unplug it. But I will say
[11:19.680 --> 11:24.320]  since then, well, what happened the second time I had to climb under my desk and do it, I was like,
[11:24.320 --> 11:29.600]  I'm three strikes in your out. So after two strikes, I bought a $40. Those things are all
[11:29.600 --> 11:36.880]  like 40 bucks. I bought like a $40 home kit plug to put in the plug under my desk where it goes.
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.200]  So that the next time it craps out, instead of climbing into the desk, I could just go to the
[11:43.200 --> 11:49.200]  home map and restart it with a tap on my finger. I mean, that's how that's how much I don't like
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.680]  getting down on my knees under the desk, even though it's not dirty. It's clean. It is still a
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.800]  pain in the ass. Yeah, I'm too good for that. So I'll spend 40 bucks and Murphy's law on the
[12:00.800 --> 12:05.680]  famously reliable home kit stuff, which actually I use it all the time. But like, I know whatever
[12:05.680 --> 12:11.600]  it fakes out at times. It's hilarious how often we use technology to fix tech like hitting this
[12:11.600 --> 12:17.600]  escalation of like, more and more requirements in order to just turn off the plug. I did that,
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.920]  I did that, though. I did that, though, last summer, I spent the 40 bucks to get the plug.
[12:21.920 --> 12:29.760]  And ever since I haven't used it once. So as soon as I bought a $40 thing to restart
[12:30.400 --> 12:35.920]  the studio display, every time it crapped out, it stopped crapping out there. There was at least one
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.800]  firmware update since then, which came with a system update to Mac OS, and then Mac OS updates
[12:42.800 --> 12:48.240]  and says there's an update for your studio display. Yes, don't touch it, let it go. But ever since
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.240]  then, it's been 100% rock solid. It was like the what happened a year ago was like the audio would
[12:54.240 --> 12:57.920]  crap out, it would like it would stop playing audio. And the only way to fix it was the power
[12:57.920 --> 13:04.320]  cycle. It hasn't happened since. So that complaint, hey, I wish I wish my display were just a dumb
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.880]  display. I don't want to have to restart it every couple weeks, blah, blah, blah. I don't have to do
[13:08.880 --> 13:15.680]  that anymore. At this point, I would say for the last like, nine, 10 months, it's effectively been
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.600]  indistinguishable from a dumb display that just always works. So yeah, you know, I believe that
[13:21.600 --> 13:27.120]  I have had no problems with it. I think I might have had to unplug it once. But I can't remember
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.520]  why that was. I don't think it was because it was just jammed up. Like the audio was working fine.
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.920]  Everything. Everything seemed to be going okay with me. I sort of pushed back against that
[13:35.920 --> 13:41.040]  notion that I just wish it was a dumb display. I mean, so the word monitor basically just means
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.080]  I'm just monitoring a video feed. In the best case, you're getting like a raw tap into what's
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.840]  happening. Displays these days are not monitored. There's none of that. And I think it's a little
[13:51.840 --> 13:56.640]  foolhardy to just say, hey, just put the bits on the screen because I think it sort of misses
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.840]  a lot of the work that's done just for color correction and all kinds of other stuff. You've
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.640]  got a whole bunch of ports back there. Something has to run those ports. I think because people
[14:06.640 --> 14:13.520]  decided, or it is an iOS derivative, therefore it's more complicated. That's probably true. And
[14:13.520 --> 14:21.760]  it may have more surface area to break kind of thing. But ultimately the flexibility gives it
[14:21.760 --> 14:26.880]  all kinds of capabilities that were not that you would have to get. Like if it was like an LG
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.080]  display, they're going to, they write software too. It's just janky and crappy. And you don't
[14:30.080 --> 14:34.080]  think of it like a little computer. It is a little computer though. It is just a worse little
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.240]  computer. So I don't really know what to tell you. These days, everything has like a little
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.920]  piece of software in it, which is kind of the current theme. You come to that all the time.
[14:42.640 --> 14:47.040]  I just think, you know, and I think that the team behind it has done what you want them to do
[14:47.040 --> 14:55.200]  is sort of, look, it's such a smaller surface area of what it does than when iOS is running
[14:55.200 --> 15:01.120]  on an actual iPhone or iPad, or even an Apple TV, the user could be doing anything. Whereas the sort
[15:01.120 --> 15:11.360]  of iOS as firmware running on something like the studio display, it only has to do two things or
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.200]  three things, right? It shows pixels on the display and does color. I'm not saying those
[15:15.200 --> 15:22.080]  things are easy, but you know, displays pixels, manages brightness, does color correction,
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.840]  plays sound through the speakers, and it runs the camera when the camera's on, or I guess the
[15:27.840 --> 15:33.280]  microphone, right? Microphone, camera, display, sound, power management, power management,
[15:33.280 --> 15:39.040]  but those, it's a known surface area and it should be very stable. And I would say from
[15:39.040 --> 15:43.920]  about two months after it started shipping, it's been rock solid stable, which is exactly what you
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.920]  want. So hats off to the studio display team, a fantastic product that I'm happy to endorse.
[15:49.920 --> 15:59.760]  Anyway, Mac Pro, 10 years ago, I remember sitting on the stage and being really excited about it.
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.280]  And I still am. I still think that I'm a bit of a weirdo though. I like the Mac cube. I like the
[16:05.280 --> 16:09.760]  Mac Pro. I did too. I didn't own one, but it was only because I couldn't afford it at the time.
[16:09.760 --> 16:16.320]  I love the Mac. The original MacBook Air was like really kind of crazy expensive, but you could
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.320]  spend even more money and get the SSD in it, which at the time was like mind boggling.
[16:20.960 --> 16:27.200]  I found the Mac Pro 2013 to be one of those cool products that had like a real vision about how
[16:27.200 --> 16:31.440]  things are going to work and what they're going to double down on. They've got one board full of
[16:31.440 --> 16:36.960]  like pretty high-end Intel chips at the time, two boards full of like pretty high-end AMD chips,
[16:37.840 --> 16:43.840]  sorry, ATI chips. And it was cool. And it had a fan in the middle. I love turning it around and
[16:43.840 --> 16:50.960]  having the lights light up on the back. It's just like the plugs, the sockets glow, which is cool,
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.760]  dumb, but a fun little neat trick. I like the way you can slide off the top of the case.
[16:56.400 --> 17:02.080]  I like the concept of the computer. I like the vision that they had for how it would
[17:02.080 --> 17:08.320]  scale and go forward. And then it didn't. And it didn't for any number of reasons. Like the Intel
[17:08.320 --> 17:14.080]  chips were hot, getting the new GPUs was hot, like fitting more and more next level or next generation
[17:14.080 --> 17:20.720]  stuff into that casing proved to be like famously the thermal corner. I admire them for trying that
[17:20.720 --> 17:25.280]  computer. I think that was very cool. I think that was the one that Schiller said, you can't
[17:25.280 --> 17:32.160]  innovate anymore my ass. I think it was. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with them. I think that's bang on.
[17:32.160 --> 17:41.200]  Great work. I think the 2019 Mac pro is amazing and incredible, but hardly is innovative in terms
[17:41.200 --> 17:49.120]  of like, let's try a drastically new kind of take on things. Right. I think that there's sort of a
[17:49.120 --> 17:57.120]  very, at least from 2013 onward, but probably going back to like 2008, which I think was when
[17:57.120 --> 18:05.120]  the proceeding Mac pro had shipped the one that the one that Syracuse wound up using for like
[18:05.120 --> 18:11.520]  40 years. Right. Yeah. Which was also a big case, right. A big sort of traditional case
[18:12.320 --> 18:21.680]  prior to that, prior to 2008, the compute the importance of the Mac to Apple and the
[18:21.680 --> 18:32.000]  overall Mac market was such that it was still the, the tailwinds of like the eighties and nineties
[18:32.640 --> 18:41.600]  where pro computers were like half of Apple sales. Right. Just the whole era before laptops taking
[18:41.600 --> 18:47.920]  over the industry where desktops were actually laptops were the niche that were more expensive
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.360]  and people only spent, you'd spend a couple extra thousand dollars to get a laptop with comparable
[18:53.360 --> 19:00.560]  specs to the same, what you could get for the desktop with the same specs. And so the desktop
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.840]  was the main computers, every company sold, including Apple. And some of them were pro
[19:05.840 --> 19:11.360]  and some of them weren't. And then everything started shifting to laptops for all the obvious
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.800]  reasons, just once the performance. Yeah. More convenient. And the performance was there and
[19:16.800 --> 19:23.600]  the price came down to the same consumer level prices. I mean, for now. One more applications
[19:23.600 --> 19:27.840]  were on the web now. Right. So you didn't need quite as much local power to do your
[19:27.840 --> 19:32.480]  outlooky style, like your calendars, your Gmail, like that kind of stuff. I mean, honestly it's
[19:32.480 --> 19:38.400]  like, and putting aside all the thermal advantages and performance at price or performance per watt
[19:38.400 --> 19:43.840]  advantages of Apple Silicon, even on the PC side with Intel, I mean, it's, it's been decades now
[19:43.840 --> 19:52.480]  where it's just no, it's no big deal to put a, a, a fine or even very nice PC into a laptop.
[19:52.480 --> 19:57.440]  Whereas like in the nineties, that was like incredibly expensive. Like just, yeah.
[19:58.080 --> 20:01.680]  Yeah. I mean, you remember all those ads for like the bunny suits and like the,
[20:01.680 --> 20:05.520]  like the Pentium with a snail, like a snail with a Pentium on the back when Apple was really
[20:05.520 --> 20:12.000]  shit talking Intel all the time. I did. They can't enchant, shouldn't do it now, but like,
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.160]  I kind of missed the shit talking version of Apple, which was pretty funny with the power PC
[20:16.160 --> 20:21.440]  stuff, despite kind of getting creamed and in a lot of ways they had like the G five was pretty
[20:21.440 --> 20:25.920]  cool. Could not fit in a laptop, which just wasn't going to happen. Right. Never. We are right. It
[20:25.920 --> 20:30.640]  was, and that was really what prompted the switch when jobs announced the switch to Intel. It was
[20:30.640 --> 20:35.200]  basically, look, I told you two years ago, we were going to put the G five in a laptop and we
[20:35.200 --> 20:40.400]  couldn't do it. And therefore we're switching. Here's why. But I think that the mismatch that's
[20:40.400 --> 20:49.440]  happened post 2008, starting with the trashcan in 2013 is that there's a sizable segment of pro Mac
[20:49.440 --> 20:55.440]  users who just want the most performance they can get for whatever the reason of what they're doing,
[20:55.440 --> 21:01.440]  whether they're aerospace engineers doing complex models of wing designs for new airplanes or
[21:01.440 --> 21:10.800]  developers with really complex, mind-bendingly complex X code projects with just massive,
[21:10.800 --> 21:16.640]  massive dependencies and very long. If you do like a totally clean build really long build cycle.
[21:17.200 --> 21:22.960]  There's precious few of those. I mean, there's Apple's pro stuff. There's Photoshop, I suppose,
[21:22.960 --> 21:28.080]  but there's, there's big apps out there, but there's not, there's not that many people who
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.880]  really need to crunch that much stuff. The Swift come every people love the Swift language. The
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.560]  Swift compiler though is relatively slow compared to most other compilers. It's just, and it's just
[21:38.560 --> 21:46.800]  a trade-off that you get a language that developers like more or even love and has these things.
[21:46.800 --> 21:52.480]  And it just making the language nicer for developers almost always makes it harder for the
[21:52.480 --> 21:57.440]  compiler. I mean, it's, I think that's a, I think that's one of the classic computer trade-offs,
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.880]  right? Like memory and speed, pick one kind of thing.
[22:00.880 --> 22:06.720]  Right. And C compilers are faster because C you're, as I'm, I love how I'm, I'm telling you
[22:06.720 --> 22:12.400]  this, but C is very low, low to the machine. Yeah. Well.
[22:13.120 --> 22:15.600]  There's optimizations that will take a long time.
[22:15.600 --> 22:21.680]  I didn't look into it, but I think I saw, I forget it. I'm calling it a tweet because it's,
[22:21.680 --> 22:24.240]  I think it's on Mastodon, but forget it. Everything's a tweet these days. I can't
[22:24.240 --> 22:27.200]  be bothered to keep track of it. Yeah. Call them tweets. I like calling
[22:27.200 --> 22:31.200]  them tweets. Yeah. I know. I liked your, your comment on that too. It's whatever. It's a form,
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.480]  not a, not an item at this point. Anyway, it was like a C compiler written in some
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.120]  incredibly small number of bytes and it just didn't do any error correction. It was like,
[22:41.120 --> 22:46.720]  I don't know if I knew it. If it doesn't do any error correction and like you,
[22:48.160 --> 22:51.440]  like just the symbols that you put, it'll turn that into code. You can write it
[22:51.440 --> 22:57.280]  tiny, like really, really tiny. It's trying to get, trying to figure out where you've gone wrong,
[22:57.280 --> 23:02.880]  which is the bulk of it. I saw the same thing. I just made a note. I will put it in the show
[23:02.880 --> 23:12.640]  notes. Some freak of nature genius packed an entire C compiler into 512 bytes because
[23:12.640 --> 23:19.040]  he wanted it to load it. There's some kind of like boot loading area on an Intel PC that is limited
[23:19.040 --> 23:25.840]  to 512 bytes. So he stuffed a C compiler in there. Yeah. And his follow up message was like,
[23:25.840 --> 23:29.680]  well, cause you're a secret programmer. We just trust that you won't screw it up, which is
[23:29.680 --> 23:35.280]  hilariously, like C's always going to screw up. That's kind of, it's basically you're juggling
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.040]  with knives at that point. His explanation, it's worth it. His, his explanation of it is
[23:41.920 --> 23:47.360]  10 times longer than the actual C compiler, but it's a wonderful explanation. If you're a nerd,
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.680]  I won't, we won't digress here, but it's, I'll put it in the show notes. I swear it's wonderful,
[23:51.680 --> 23:57.120]  but anyway, where I'm going though, is that app there's, there's a number of pro Mac users who
[23:57.120 --> 24:04.160]  just wish that Apple would, would have done the 2019 Mac pro all along. Just keep it in a big box
[24:04.160 --> 24:10.480]  where Apple doesn't have to worry about the thermals. Just sell a big box that opens up and
[24:10.480 --> 24:16.800]  puts Intel stuff inside and runs, hopefully runs as quiet as possible and give it a lot of ports
[24:16.800 --> 24:22.400]  on the back and just give me the performance and wish that they had done that all along.
[24:23.120 --> 24:28.800]  And in the meantime though, we'd go through these year long gaps without any update on the Mac pro
[24:28.800 --> 24:36.080]  and people who care about the Mac pro would worry that Apple wasn't interested in the Mac pro at all
[24:36.080 --> 24:44.240]  anymore. What do you got? And it's the danger of being on this one weird platform or platforms at
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.360]  this point from Apple, where if you're in the Apple ecosystem and Apple isn't interested in
[24:49.360 --> 24:55.200]  making hardware X, you don't have an option to buy it. Right. So like, if you like, if you like
[24:55.200 --> 25:00.480]  the mini iPhone form factor now that they've apparently stopped making it a year ago with
[25:00.480 --> 25:06.720]  the iPhone 13 mini you're, you're out of luck. Right. I mean, now the upside is like huge fan
[25:06.720 --> 25:11.280]  of the mini form factor. The only reason it doesn't hurt so much with the iPhone mini is
[25:11.280 --> 25:17.120]  that there really isn't such a thing in the Android world either. But like with, with PCs,
[25:17.120 --> 25:23.120]  you can get any weird form factor you want. Right. So if you still like 17 inch or 18 inch
[25:23.120 --> 25:28.960]  lunch tray size laptops, you can get them in the PC world. No, you can get really gigantic.
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.480]  The biggest ones are often really tricked out and like, yeah. Right. Yeah. You can't,
[25:34.480 --> 25:37.680]  you can't get that in the Apple world. Yeah. You can get weird hardware.
[25:37.680 --> 25:44.240]  Right. I think at least people accusing Apple of being monopoly, but that's not how monopolies work.
[25:44.240 --> 25:48.480]  No. They're a monopoly on Mac OS, but it's a monopoly? I don't know. It's not,
[25:48.480 --> 25:52.960]  not really. It just, it's, it is a unit. It is. And if that,
[25:52.960 --> 25:56.000]  if they're not making something for you and you have different requirements, then
[25:57.600 --> 26:04.240]  it's a big ass to switch ecosystems. All right. Which is, I think an oblique way of getting it,
[26:04.240 --> 26:09.280]  what this new Mac pro may be. One of the issues is a lot of these very,
[26:09.280 --> 26:15.440]  very custom workflows are tuned for Intel and not necessarily tuned for Apple Silicon.
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.920]  And now you're coming out with a new Mac pro let's give it fantasy specs of like, it's
[26:21.200 --> 26:28.320]  probably won't be able to, but let's say double a, an M1 studio. So an M what is it? M1 ultra,
[26:28.320 --> 26:35.200]  I believe, which I have, and it is fast as hell. Like I, I don't need a Mac pro. I, for many,
[26:35.200 --> 26:42.480]  many years, I would buy Mac pros. Mac studio is pro enough for me. And I think I would effectively
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.480]  be, it's similar to the studio display that we were talking about, where to go up to the XDR,
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.440]  I feel would be extra money that I don't need to spend in order for my actual use case. And I think
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.600]  the studio does that. So where does that leave the next Mac pro? A whole bunch of Apple Silicon
[26:59.600 --> 27:05.280]  thrown out a problem, but software not yet tuned for it and may not be tuned to it for a while.
[27:06.000 --> 27:12.160]  Well, I, I just keep going back to that 2013 one from 10 years ago. And I feel like it's,
[27:13.120 --> 27:17.360]  it's almost like what, what the people who love the Mac pro were thinking is I'm so worried that
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.800]  Apple doesn't care about it anymore. And in fact, I think it's the opposite. It's that Apple cared
[27:22.800 --> 27:32.480]  so much and, and at, at very high levels in Mac engineering and product marketing like Phil Schiller,
[27:32.480 --> 27:41.040]  they really do value the sort of race car version of workstation computing. And they cared so much
[27:41.040 --> 27:50.800]  that they engineered this incredibly in a way, beautiful Mac pro the cylinder and it, it,
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.160]  with the highest finish super shiny. I mean, it looks like something from, again,
[27:56.160 --> 28:04.160]  like a star Wars movie or something. It's dark, shiny thing and engineered an incredibly innovative
[28:04.160 --> 28:08.640]  thermal system to do the exhaust through the middle. They spent an incredible, I mean,
[28:08.640 --> 28:14.400]  it's not just like, Oh, it's going to be small. And some Johnny Ive or somebody else on his team
[28:14.400 --> 28:20.240]  did a sketch of a cylinder and handed it off. I mean, it was a monumental amount of design
[28:20.240 --> 28:27.440]  and engineering work to make that work. And it just was a bad bet on a really bad bet on where
[28:27.440 --> 28:36.080]  PC computing was going for the rest of that decade, which was all towards big acid GPUs
[28:36.080 --> 28:42.880]  that a physically wouldn't fit inside there and B even if they somehow could be reduced in size
[28:42.880 --> 28:52.880]  to fit, wouldn't have the thermal headroom to, to run as hot as they do. I just think people,
[28:52.880 --> 28:57.280]  the people who were worried would have been happier if Apple cared less and it just phoned it
[28:57.280 --> 29:03.440]  in with the big box all along. Yeah. I think there's just two points to that. I think the
[29:03.440 --> 29:08.800]  suppliers that Apple was dealing with at the time Intel and ATI, they did not share the incentives
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.640]  that Apple did. Apple wanted to make quiet, very, very fast computers, both laptops. And in this
[29:14.640 --> 29:22.240]  case on the desktop, whereas both Intel and ATI at the time, or very soon after were incentivized
[29:22.240 --> 29:28.880]  to make the biggest, most power hungry chips they can because they were getting pushed up market
[29:28.880 --> 29:36.000]  specifically with the like some of the ATI and the AI and sort of crypto mining stuff that all
[29:36.000 --> 29:41.360]  the GPUs got sucked up in the, the parameters under which they were expected to operate
[29:42.320 --> 29:47.600]  changed. Like their, their markets were chasing the high end power is no consequence kind of
[29:47.600 --> 29:52.320]  thing. Whereas Apple really wanted what they ended up making for themselves in terms of Apple's
[29:52.320 --> 29:57.840]  Silicon. And I guess the second thing with that is while I really admire them for making the
[29:57.840 --> 30:04.720]  trashcan or a different form factor experimenting with stuff, is it like, did they make an El Camino
[30:04.720 --> 30:09.200]  when they're like, this is a pickup truck, but it's, it looks cool. Like, well, this is a pickup
[30:09.200 --> 30:13.600]  truck. Looks like a pickup truck for a reason. And I don't mean the crazy over the top modern
[30:13.600 --> 30:18.720]  ones that are basically like, there's a limo in front and like, like none of that. That's an
[30:18.720 --> 30:24.960]  obscene exaggeration of a pickup truck, but like a good old Ford pickup truck that you'd see banging
[30:24.960 --> 30:29.440]  around a farm kind of thing like that. It works. It's a flatbed. It's got wheels and it, it will
[30:29.440 --> 30:35.520]  last forever. Don't mess with it. Right. Don't mess with it. Yeah. All right. Let's take a
[30:35.520 --> 30:38.320]  break and we'll keep, we'll pick it up. Let me take a break here and take our first sponsor
[30:38.320 --> 30:44.320]  though. It's our good friends at rocket money. Rocket money is a personal finance app that
[30:44.320 --> 30:50.240]  finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending and helps you lower your
[30:50.240 --> 30:56.560]  bills all in one place. Do you know how much you actually spend on subscriptions every month?
[30:56.560 --> 31:02.320]  Most Americans that rocket money did a poll. Most Americans think they spend around 80 bucks a month
[31:02.320 --> 31:09.040]  on subscriptions, but when you tally it up, it's actually, the average is closer to $200. So most
[31:09.040 --> 31:14.560]  people's guess as to how much they spend on subscriptions every month is off by more than
[31:14.560 --> 31:18.800]  a factor of two. And if you don't know exactly how much you're spending every month, you need
[31:18.800 --> 31:26.240]  rocket money. It's so easy. You sign up for rocket money. They analyze your finances and they report
[31:26.240 --> 31:32.960]  to you exactly every single subscription that's coming in on your credit cards and let you go
[31:32.960 --> 31:39.280]  through them. And it's a great way to either a cancel the ones where you're like, I don't really
[31:39.280 --> 31:43.280]  use that anymore. I'm subscribed to this streaming service. Maybe you signed up for a streaming
[31:43.280 --> 31:48.880]  service to get like one specific show and you never canceled something like that or subscriptions
[31:48.880 --> 31:54.400]  that you would completely forgot about and are just continuing to recur every month without you
[31:54.400 --> 31:58.000]  even thinking about it. And you're like, ah, I don't, I haven't used that in months. Cancel
[31:58.800 --> 32:05.360]  rocket money is absolutely great that, and they even let you cancel subscriptions right within
[32:05.360 --> 32:11.520]  rocket money itself. You can just let rocket money cancels subscription for you right there
[32:11.520 --> 32:16.960]  in the list, save time, just get it done. You don't have to like make a to do to remind yourself
[32:16.960 --> 32:22.880]  to cancel this, cancel that, do it right in rocket money and save some money. It's one of those
[32:22.880 --> 32:28.480]  things you sign up for rocket money and you actually save money by paying for rocket money
[32:28.480 --> 32:34.160]  because you canceled so much stuff that you weren't using. Didn't remember that sort of thing.
[32:34.160 --> 32:38.880]  Rocket money also helps you manage all of your finances in one place and automatically
[32:38.880 --> 32:44.320]  categorizes your expenses. So you can easily track your entire budget in real time and also
[32:44.320 --> 32:51.280]  get alerted. If anything looks off over 3 million people have used rocket money and they have saved
[32:51.280 --> 32:58.400]  the average user of the app up to $720 a year, 720 bucks a year, 3 million people stop throwing
[32:58.400 --> 33:03.440]  your money away, cancel your unwanted subscriptions and manage your expenses the easy way by going to
[33:03.440 --> 33:11.840]  rocket money.com slash the talk show. That's rocket money.com slash the talk show, rocket
[33:11.840 --> 33:20.000]  money.com, the talk show. So that's what I hear. Here's where I'm going with all this. I think,
[33:20.000 --> 33:27.600]  I think that I think we are going to see the Mac pro at WWDC and I think they're going to go back
[33:27.600 --> 33:35.520]  to ambitious and ambitious design. I think so. I do not think so. I do not think it's going to
[33:35.520 --> 33:43.680]  look like the 2019 one and you open it up and there's a tiny, tiny little. Because it would be
[33:43.680 --> 33:48.880]  pretty funny. It's like, have you ever seen like, like by the tail end of VCRs or CD players, like
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.720]  you'd open them up and they're mostly just that shape to fit in the cabinet. Otherwise it's just
[33:54.720 --> 34:01.520]  empty space. What about the one alien and in one of the men in black movies, there was an alien.
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.520]  Oh, yeah. And I think it was like, it was like a eight foot tall alien and his chest opened up.
[34:07.520 --> 34:14.720]  And in fact, there's a little, a little guy, the size dude, like a, like a frog and the outer guy
[34:14.720 --> 34:18.880]  and the outer guy was just a robot. And the real alien was just a little, like a little
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.440]  Babu Frick, like the Skywalker reference. Yeah. The only good part of that movie. Yeah. The only
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.240]  good scene in the whole movie, Babu Frick, a little guy like that. There's some argument to
[34:28.240 --> 34:33.360]  be like the, the new case was received incredibly well. Like people like that's awesome. And I think
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.440]  maybe if you roll out another, I don't know, you come out with a pyramid, people are going to be
[34:37.440 --> 34:43.520]  like, would you stop doing, stop it. Just give us what we want. But I don't know. I do think that
[34:43.520 --> 34:48.720]  there may be, I think there's going to almost have to be some, like, it can't just be a bigger,
[34:48.720 --> 34:53.120]  better max studio. Like what's the, what's the point really? Why didn't you just make
[34:53.120 --> 35:01.120]  a little bit of a bigger max studio and do that? So that brings us to expansion and graphics cards
[35:01.120 --> 35:05.760]  and all of that jazz. And sort of a lot of the, a lot of the weight in that industry is on Nvidia,
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.480]  who have been having some recent issues, but it seems more of a short term thing. And I'll
[35:12.480 --> 35:18.480]  leave that to you and Ben to figure out. I'm a little bit behind on dithering, but could Apple
[35:18.480 --> 35:22.880]  work with Nvidia? Yeah, probably. Would they? I don't know. Both those companies seem so
[35:22.880 --> 35:27.680]  headstrong then they, they get a real sense. They don't like each other. The other aspect that I was
[35:27.680 --> 35:34.720]  kind of touching on was a lot of this lower level stuff is sort of very, very tuned for Intel things.
[35:34.720 --> 35:39.520]  And I was joking previously about this. I honestly don't think this is going to be the case,
[35:39.520 --> 35:45.360]  but do you remember those 46 boards that you could plug into like max way back in the nineties?
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.800]  I do. I would, I would laugh. I would laugh my ass off if there was like, like a, like a little
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.560]  tiny, awesome Apple Silicon thing. And then just a slot was like, well, we just stuck a PC in there
[35:56.560 --> 36:02.000]  because, because we can, for those, as an add on, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, if you want,
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.120]  if you want the add on whatever, we'll give you a whole bunch of like Intel chips stuck on a board.
[36:07.120 --> 36:13.120]  They have the capability to do that, right? Like Mac OS runs on Intel. They can make their daughter
[36:13.120 --> 36:17.920]  board board talk to the thing. I think it's crazy. I do not think that's going to happen.
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.400]  I'm just spitballing weird and crazy things that you could do with a massive enclosure like that.
[36:22.400 --> 36:27.280]  And ultimately you do need to address the expandability mark somehow for that, for that,
[36:27.280 --> 36:31.680]  For those who don't remember, I don't remember it was sometime in the nineties, but at some point in
[36:31.680 --> 36:38.880]  the nineties, Apple sold, you could buy, I think it might've been before the power PC. Maybe that's,
[36:38.880 --> 36:46.480]  you know, it could have been with the Motorola X 68, 6,000, 68,000 series, but you could buy
[36:47.040 --> 36:54.560]  a very expensive. I forget the name of those slots. New bus was a new bus might've been new
[36:54.560 --> 36:57.920]  bus. Yeah. It might've been new bus. I'll try to look it up for the show notes here,
[36:57.920 --> 37:04.880]  but there would be a very expensive card that was effectively just a whole, it's just a whole Intel
[37:04.880 --> 37:12.720]  PC. You'd put it in a card and then you'd launch like an app and you'd be in Mac OS or system seven
[37:12.720 --> 37:19.440]  or whatever it was at the time and launch an app that would run a PC, but instead of emulating,
[37:19.440 --> 37:25.440]  it was running it on the PC and the card. So it wasn't, you didn't, I don't think if I,
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.120]  if I'm recalling, I didn't own one cause I had no need for it and it was very expensive,
[37:29.680 --> 37:35.120]  but it wasn't a dual boot type thing. It wasn't like shut down the Mac and hold down the P and
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.720]  the C keys on the keyboard and reboot into the PC. No, it would run as an app, but those apps
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.080]  weren't being emulated. They were running on a PC on a card. It was crazy. Yeah. If anything,
[37:46.080 --> 37:51.280]  it was a little bit like classic where some, I mean, it was all on the same thing, but like,
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.120]  you remember how classic was these janky cutout windows that like you dragged in another window
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.440]  across it. It would do the no redraw thing from windows back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. You could
[37:59.440 --> 38:07.120]  see it repaint. Yeah. I don't think they're going to do that. And I, for whether Apple is going to
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.240]  be able to pull this off or not. I mean, effectively, I know Nvidia has competition.
[38:12.240 --> 38:18.400]  AMD has graphic cards that are, that are well-regarded, but there's no dispute that
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.760]  Nvidia's are the best or the fastest. If what you really need is the highest performance GPU
[38:23.760 --> 38:29.200]  and lots of people who are not video game enthusiasts are doing work that requires
[38:29.200 --> 38:34.400]  the fastest possible GPU they can get. Well, there's also specifically CUDA,
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.600]  which is their programming model for that, which is sort of a, sort of similar to metal shaders.
[38:39.600 --> 38:45.120]  There were metal compute shaders, specifically Apple sort of invented and abandoned OpenCL,
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.720]  which was another take on the same kind of like general purpose program or general programming
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.080]  on a GPU style device kind of thing. But CUDA is the one that's captured everybody's imagination.
[38:56.080 --> 39:02.320]  Like that's, that is the go-to programming model for high-end GPU stuff now. So yeah,
[39:02.320 --> 39:09.280]  not only do they need the speed, but I feel like a little bit like Intel. If Intel slipped a
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.520]  generation and they weren't the fastest chip, you were still running the Intel instruction set.
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.440]  Right. But that's slowly going like that advantages, but you know, for years,
[39:19.440 --> 39:24.800]  if they had a bad one, eh, it's not the end of the world because ultimately AMD is still running
[39:25.440 --> 39:29.360]  our instruction set and we are holding those reins.
[39:29.360 --> 39:34.640]  Right. So like, I think what you're saying here is, so let's just say next week at the keynote,
[39:34.640 --> 39:44.320]  John Ternus is up on stage and he's introducing a new Mac Pro and lo and behold, Apple can flat out
[39:44.320 --> 39:50.640]  say this, whatever it is, it's, it's not a M1 Ultra, M1's too old at this point, M2,
[39:50.640 --> 39:58.720]  whatever the name is. And for the Mac Pro and Mac Pro only, Apple has their own Apple Silicon
[39:58.720 --> 40:08.800]  graphics that outperform Nvidia's top of the line, whatever. So cycle for cycle outperforms Nvidia
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.040]  at the high end. That's still- I don't think they could do it given the same power budget.
[40:13.040 --> 40:19.600]  Right. But that may, but that may not be enough for the industry because the industry is locked
[40:19.600 --> 40:26.240]  into CUDA or not locked in, but CUDA has so much momentum and those type of things, if you've got
[40:26.240 --> 40:33.200]  this whole, the thousands and thousands of programmer person hours into CUDA and experience
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.160]  in CUDA. And so you've got a code base and experience, and it's, you know, that you can just
[40:40.160 --> 40:47.600]  buy Intel PCs and Nvidia graphics cards going forward. That train is, has left the station and
[40:47.600 --> 40:53.840]  it's, it's not enough for Apple to say, if you use our APIs instead of CUDA, you'll get better
[40:53.840 --> 41:01.120]  performance. They're like, it may not be enough. I think that's right. Yeah. Also it's, it's like
[41:01.120 --> 41:07.520]  the Win32 API, which lasted forever. There was a massive lock-in in Windows, even after into the
[41:07.520 --> 41:13.040]  2000s, where the Mac took off. There's still a bunch of stuff like, and the stuff that is
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.920]  very window centric is often this high-end performance stuff like, like architectural
[41:17.920 --> 41:22.640]  software, like CAD software. There's very like industry niche specific things that are tied to
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.800]  Windows. Not because they couldn't run on the Mac, but because like, well, bringing that over
[41:26.800 --> 41:30.960]  is a huge pain in the ass and we're not going to get the market we can get. And a lot of these
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.560]  people buy computers to run that software rather than the other way. The other thing with CUDA is
[41:36.560 --> 41:41.840]  that yes, people are accustomed to the API and all that, but like one of the issues, not, not after
[41:41.840 --> 41:47.920]  the iPhone, prior to it was getting developers who knew Objective-C was a huge pain in the ass,
[41:47.920 --> 41:52.640]  which limited the talent pool that you could bring in for Microsoft needed to train up a bunch of
[41:52.640 --> 41:56.400]  people. Adobe needed to train up people. Apple internally needs to train up a bunch of people.
[41:56.400 --> 42:00.880]  I know big nerd ranch had a lot of hand in it and a lot of that. And like getting people up to
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.640]  standard or, or knowing how to do stuff with Objective-C was a huge lift until maybe the iPhone
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.600]  made it so that everybody wanted Objective-C. Swift came easier, I think, because it was a
[42:11.600 --> 42:17.680]  little bit more familiar, but also everybody wanted to be on the iPhone anyway. So whenever
[42:17.680 --> 42:24.240]  everybody learned Swift, cause they had to CUDA is where it's at some CUDA like Apple only thing
[42:25.120 --> 42:29.920]  less so, and if you want to hire somebody you're like, okay, well, you know, all of the basics,
[42:29.920 --> 42:34.880]  you know how CUDA works is works mostly the same, but it's not quite the same and having
[42:34.880 --> 42:39.920]  experience with like the particulars of the device matters in these cases. Cause like an
[42:39.920 --> 42:44.880]  Nvidia device, well, first of all, the big thing is that the memory bandwidth, like an Nvidia
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.240]  devices, they've got the Ram right next to the right next to the GPU and on Apple devices,
[42:50.240 --> 42:56.720]  it's all shared with the CPU. So the costs of sending something to the card on a Nvidia device
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.280]  are greater than an Apple device. They're smaller, which means you may tweak your algorithms in
[43:01.280 --> 43:05.120]  completely different ways. For the Nvidia, you may be like, I'm going to give you everything and you
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.680]  figure it out and then get back to me. And for an Apple one, you may want like a more iterative
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.240]  operating in place kind of algorithm, which are totally different approaches, regardless of
[43:14.240 --> 43:22.800]  whatever CUDA or metal shader, like it's difficult and different. And in order to make your incredible
[43:22.800 --> 43:28.240]  new Mac pro a success, you kind of want people to be able to do the same thing they're always
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.240]  doing, you know, to leverage it, but you're going to need them to do something slightly different.
[43:32.240 --> 43:37.360]  And I fear that that's exactly what happened in 2013 is that in order to take the best advantage
[43:37.360 --> 43:45.520]  of the 2013 Mac pro you needed to program these crazy dual GPU, ATI boards, and you sort of needed
[43:45.520 --> 43:50.160]  to change your programming model up a bit. And I think that's kind of where it stalled out beyond
[43:50.160 --> 43:57.040]  the hardware failures of like heat and like stuff like just presuppose that everything worked
[43:57.040 --> 44:01.440]  perfectly. I still think you've got a bit of an uphill battle in terms of convincing people that
[44:01.440 --> 44:10.720]  this model of computer, this model of computing is the way to go. So yeah, it just makes me excited
[44:10.720 --> 44:16.320]  to see the announcement. And I know I, again, we'll get to the headset, but if the WWDC keynote
[44:16.320 --> 44:21.840]  comes and goes without mention of the Mac pro, I'm going to find it baffling. I really am. Because
[44:24.400 --> 44:29.120]  I know that it was over a year ago at this point, it was like at the end of March or April last year
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.920]  when they did the little mid-cycle special, I think it was all remote, it was broadcast. But
[44:35.920 --> 44:40.560]  when they announced the Mac studio and the studio display and Ternus said at the end of the whole
[44:40.560 --> 44:46.560]  thing, we're not quite complete with our move to Apple Silicon. We've got one more yet to come.
[44:46.560 --> 44:51.760]  That's the Mac pro, but that's a story for another day or something like that. I forget exactly how
[44:51.760 --> 44:57.920]  we said it. It was very carefully, it wasn't dashed off, right? Number one, it's not live.
[44:57.920 --> 45:03.760]  Yeah. Well, also, they don't do that even live. I don't think maybe they dash stuff up. They're
[45:03.760 --> 45:10.640]  very, very good at communicating. I know for a fact, I cannot name my source, but let's say
[45:11.360 --> 45:20.000]  a person very close to the matter, I can confirm that Can't Innovate Anymore My Ass was an ad lib.
[45:20.000 --> 45:23.360]  Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome. Oh, I love that. That's great.
[45:23.920 --> 45:29.680]  It was not in the rehearsals. But also one of the very few people who could get away with that,
[45:29.680 --> 45:36.080]  right? Yeah. Who could? Who could take the call from Tim Cook after the keynote? And hey,
[45:36.080 --> 45:42.160]  was that in the script? And, you know, justify it. So it did happen on stage occasionally,
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.920]  where there'd be an ad lib. But that was very careful. And I re I also do not think
[45:48.560 --> 45:56.800]  that, like Apple, like Ternus thought in April last year, that the Mac Pro was just around the
[45:56.800 --> 46:03.440]  corner. I think they knew the roadmap. And obviously, something has changed since 2020,
[46:03.440 --> 46:08.560]  when they first announced the shift to Apple Silicon, and said, we expect we're going to
[46:08.560 --> 46:14.320]  start later this year, and we expect to get the whole platform on Apple Silicon in one year.
[46:14.960 --> 46:22.000]  Obviously, the Mac Pro has blown past that one year. But so something changed at that point.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.400]  But I think last year, when they introduced the Mac Studio, they knew what was coming. And I don't
[46:26.400 --> 46:35.360]  know what it is. But I it's got to be something to me, there's that is as as dramatically better
[46:35.360 --> 46:40.480]  than the Mac Studio as the Mac Studio is from the Mac Mini, maybe even more so. And I don't know
[46:40.480 --> 46:45.600]  what that means. But me neither. I think maybe to figure out or to have a better guess of what
[46:45.600 --> 46:50.400]  that would be would be to understand the markets that they're trying to serve. Like, I don't know,
[46:50.400 --> 46:54.640]  are you going to give these to Pixar? Are you going to give them to like, who? Who are you
[46:54.640 --> 46:59.600]  building these things for? Is it Genentech? Are you doing like crazy gene research or all of them?
[46:59.600 --> 47:04.400]  We built a thing that will like figure out COVID in like, over an afternoon while you're drinking
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.760]  a cup of tea. Right? Like, what is it? And then you can maybe guess. But would you? I guess my
[47:09.760 --> 47:16.400]  question for you is if WWDC comes and goes, and there's no mention of the Mac Pro, and like a
[47:16.400 --> 47:22.240]  week later, they get you on the phone. I'm like, Hey, John, we got bad news. We're just not doing
[47:22.240 --> 47:26.160]  one. We're happy with the Mac Studio. Obviously, they're going to spin it. We're very happy with
[47:26.160 --> 47:31.200]  that. It turned out better than we expected. Yeah. It's like you work for Apple PR.
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.720]  That's exactly what they would say. It's worked out better than we expected. And that would
[47:38.720 --> 47:44.480]  presuppose that they are going to announce the next generation Mac Studio though, right? Sure.
[47:44.480 --> 47:49.360]  And they just say, here's the M2 level Mac Studio. Better. Yeah, I could see that. I guess
[47:49.360 --> 47:53.600]  we had a plan. It turns out our plan did not survive contact with the enemy and that we
[47:53.600 --> 47:58.160]  defeated the enemy. And now we're all one big, happy family. And like the Mac Pro is awesome.
[47:58.160 --> 48:07.040]  The Mac Studio is awesome. So why not? I guess that's the second most likely scenario. I think
[48:07.040 --> 48:13.360]  the most likely scenario is an incredibly innovative architecture. Not even talking.
[48:13.360 --> 48:24.080]  And again, I think Apple's long-term internal affinity. Everybody's fear that Apple doesn't
[48:24.080 --> 48:29.840]  care about the Mac Pros because obviously it's the least selling Mac made by quantity because
[48:29.840 --> 48:35.520]  it's super expensive. And the only way... I know. It's not the only factor in how it works. I know.
[48:35.520 --> 48:40.640]  I'm preaching to the choir here. Right. But people worry, and I think a quote unquote typical
[48:40.640 --> 48:44.560]  company would think that way and think that there's why in the world are we spending any
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.680]  resources at all on this thing for 10,000? Or I don't know how many people buy Mac Pros. Maybe
[48:49.680 --> 48:56.240]  it's more than tens of thousands, but it certainly isn't millions, right? It's somewhere in the
[48:56.240 --> 49:01.040]  thousands. Why are we spending all this time on this when we sell a billion iPhones a year?
[49:01.040 --> 49:05.200]  There's no comparison. All we care about is iPhone, iPhone, iPhone. That's not how Apple
[49:05.200 --> 49:10.800]  thinks internally. And they have a keen interest in it from an industrial design perspective that
[49:10.800 --> 49:15.600]  the trash can for all of it's all the things we did complain about it already on this show.
[49:15.600 --> 49:21.840]  It was a marvel of design and shows how much they care. Even the 2019 one where they're like,
[49:21.840 --> 49:27.120]  okay, okay, we'll just put an Intel thing in a big box. But they'd spent five minutes in the
[49:27.120 --> 49:32.880]  keynote talking about how they drilled the holes in a special pattern. Yeah.
[49:32.880 --> 49:40.320]  Yeah. They, they, they, they spent five minutes on that and they really wanted to talk about it.
[49:40.320 --> 49:47.040]  They spent the, they, they engineered thousand dollar wheels. I mean, they do care, but the
[49:47.040 --> 49:52.160]  other thing, but the other thing is people think that that's Apple just wanting money, which sure.
[49:52.160 --> 49:59.040]  But at the other point, it's like, well, they, they did things that they really wanted for
[49:59.040 --> 50:05.360]  themselves, just to make it a work of art. And they did it against a consumer body that is willing
[50:05.360 --> 50:11.920]  to pay the price. Like this hinge costs a thousand bucks. Is that dumb to lay people? Sure. Is that
[50:11.920 --> 50:16.240]  a drop in the, I mean, let's not get into the writer's strike and how much money the studios
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.800]  have, but they can afford a few stands, right? Just drop in the bucket for that.
[50:20.800 --> 50:30.400]  But I, I think that the other thing that it's easily overlooked is, is how ambitious the whole
[50:30.400 --> 50:38.240]  Johnny Suruji division is on put the industrial design aside, just the system architecture side
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.920]  for the M-series chips there. It's incredibly ambitious what they've been doing with Apple
[50:43.920 --> 50:50.960]  Silicon. And it explains because before Apple Silicon, at some point between the years like
[50:50.960 --> 50:58.640]  2015, 2016, and 2020, when they finally announced it, it was clear from just pure benchmarks that
[50:58.640 --> 51:05.440]  iPhones were outperforming, like on single core benchmarks, outperforming MacBooks, MacBook pros.
[51:07.840 --> 51:13.760]  They could have built Macs using a series chips. I mean, in fact, they did with the developer
[51:13.760 --> 51:18.400]  kit thing, the developer kit that they gave out in 2020 was based on an A-series chip,
[51:18.400 --> 51:24.640]  and it was a good computer and it had the same nice performance per watt advantages overall.
[51:24.640 --> 51:27.520]  They could have just sold that. They could have just called it a day and be like, you know what,
[51:27.520 --> 51:33.600]  iPhone chip and a thing, here you go. But they spent a fortune of money, of time,
[51:33.600 --> 51:40.160]  engineering talent to build this entire M-series architecture, which makes no sense for phones,
[51:40.160 --> 51:47.120]  right? You'd never put these chips into phones because of the size and power characteristics.
[51:47.120 --> 51:52.720]  A-series chips are exactly what you want in a phone, and these M-series chips are what you want
[51:52.720 --> 52:01.120]  in PC class desktop computers and laptops, and really incredibly innovative. You mentioned the
[52:01.120 --> 52:08.720]  shared memory before, and it's such an inversion of the way things were before, where Intel had
[52:08.720 --> 52:16.000]  been selling integrated graphics on their lower-end consumer PCs for years, that shared
[52:16.000 --> 52:22.320]  memory. And that was like a downside. It was like, oh, it's a thousand dollar laptop with
[52:22.320 --> 52:28.000]  shared memory. With Apple, it's the opposite, where it's this tremendous performance advantage
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.040]  because the graphics are designed with the CPU in mind to work together that they can share memory,
[52:35.040 --> 52:41.200]  and when something in memory goes from the CPU to GPU, it's already there, and you save this
[52:41.200 --> 52:47.600]  whole copy. Yeah, over a bus. People go bananas over bus speeds, but guess what? How about no bus
[52:47.600 --> 52:53.440]  speed? No, infinite, right? Literally infinite bus speed, which is when you're doing things
[52:54.080 --> 53:01.360]  at the speed of modern computers a million times a second or something incomprehensible to human
[53:01.360 --> 53:07.520]  mind's speed, those copies matter. Who knows what else they might have up their sleeve in terms of
[53:08.160 --> 53:14.400]  architectural pushing the entire state-of-the-art forward that would only be in the Mac Pro? And
[53:14.400 --> 53:22.880]  I've drawn this analogy on the show before, but I think it's a really good one. In very broad
[53:22.880 --> 53:31.920]  strokes, it's why consumer car companies have Formula One racing divisions and make race cars.
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.480]  I was about to just exactly back that up, which is the purpose of the Mac Pro is not necessarily
[53:38.480 --> 53:43.840]  to sell units, but it's to encourage people in the lab to figure out interconnects between,
[53:43.840 --> 53:50.560]  okay, now we've got two M1 Ultras or two M2 Ultras. How do we build that interconnect? How
[53:50.560 --> 53:56.080]  do we make that work as fast as possible? How do we deal with memory contention, which was a big
[53:56.080 --> 54:02.080]  issue. I mean, whatever, coming back in history, in the nineties, like a lot of Sun and similar
[54:02.080 --> 54:07.760]  workstations had different ways of addressing memory and working the details out on all of that
[54:08.640 --> 54:14.000]  behooves the platforms lower down, right? Like as eventually, whatever you put in your Mac Pro
[54:14.000 --> 54:21.280]  2023, that tech will find its way into product X, whatever product X happens to be, like no idea
[54:21.280 --> 54:26.400]  what it's going to be, but any research that you've done in order to use the high end affected,
[54:26.400 --> 54:30.080]  I don't know if it's a loss leader, probably a loss leader, but it's going to filter down, right?
[54:30.080 --> 54:35.680]  And by stretching yourself to do these obscene and crazy things, you will ultimately learn a
[54:35.680 --> 54:39.520]  whole bunch that can be applied elsewhere, not necessarily taking the parts, but taking what
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.480]  you've learned and using that elsewhere is invaluable.
[54:42.480 --> 54:49.280]  If, if you're single-mindedly focused on the phone, you really wouldn't need any more graphic
[54:49.280 --> 54:55.920]  capability than to push a 6.7 inch display at retina level, right? And I know there's rumors
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.160]  that the next year's phones might be a quarter of an inch bigger or something like that, but the
[55:00.160 --> 55:04.560]  basic size of a phone is relatively small. You know how many pixels there are, but if you're
[55:05.280 --> 55:11.440]  also have this division that's spent years trying to push the state of the art forward for giant
[55:11.440 --> 55:20.000]  5K, 6K, get it up to 8K displays, all of a sudden you've got this architecture and muscle
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.920]  and experience where maybe you could build something like a headset with two 8K displays
[55:25.920 --> 55:31.360]  in front of each eye and have it run cool on a thing that's in front of your face. That,
[55:31.360 --> 55:37.520]  that tech would make no sense on a phone or even an iPad really in terms of how many pixels it's
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.960]  pushing. But all of a sudden here's the new product category where us having us, Apple,
[55:42.960 --> 55:50.720]  having built these race car workstations for the Mac, it all of a sudden it's relevant to
[55:51.360 --> 55:55.280]  what ultimately is intended to be a mass market consumer product.
[55:55.280 --> 56:00.400]  Yeah, I think there's a lot of computing or computer companies. I don't even know if they
[56:00.400 --> 56:08.400]  exist. Dell, HP is gone, Compaq. There was that run in the 90s of sort of built to order things
[56:08.400 --> 56:14.880]  that did well and made a lot of money on basically having the supply chain all work out, like just in
[56:14.880 --> 56:21.520]  time manufacturing and all of that. Apple doesn't wait for technology to become available from its
[56:21.520 --> 56:29.360]  partners. Apple makes the technology by itself. And while ATI and Nvidia are stretching to try
[56:29.360 --> 56:37.920]  to fill GPU quarters for crypto or AI or whatever the high-end massively parallel programming model
[56:37.920 --> 56:47.280]  du jour is, or premise du jour is, Apple is left alone in some ways to like, it has to be the one
[56:47.280 --> 56:52.000]  inventing new ways to use this stuff and has to be the one pushing itself. Certainly games aren't
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.680]  doing it for them. They need to be the one reaching just that extra little bit further.
[56:57.680 --> 57:03.040]  And I admire them for doing it in all kinds of ways, both in the thermal
[57:03.040 --> 57:07.040]  corners that they trapped themselves in and maybe in a giant ass computer that's going to
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.760]  really confuse us. Or if they're just like, you know what, we got a lot of really fast compute,
[57:11.760 --> 57:14.400]  but we can't make a product out of it. So forget it.
[57:15.040 --> 57:21.280]  And I think it's directly related, even though it's not a workstation class machine, but the
[57:21.280 --> 57:32.640]  other overly ambitious Mac design that got ahead of what the internals could support was the
[57:32.640 --> 57:38.800]  no-adjective 12-inch MacBook. We have that one too. If there's a dumb Apple computer,
[57:38.800 --> 57:45.760]  I bought it. I don't know what to tell you. The 12-inch MacBook makes, even today's,
[57:45.760 --> 57:52.960]  and I'm a little surprised. I didn't know what name they would call it, but bringing something
[57:52.960 --> 57:58.400]  back that is insanely thin was something I thought Apple would do because it was clearly
[57:58.400 --> 58:03.680]  something they were interested in a decade ago. But it really did. And when you look at one side
[58:03.680 --> 58:08.960]  by side, especially when you hold it, it's like pictures on the web didn't do justice to how much
[58:08.960 --> 58:16.160]  thinner it was than the MacBook Airs of the time. It was just so thin and light compared to anything
[58:16.160 --> 58:21.680]  else Apple had ever made. And the performance just stunk because that was the best. It was like,
[58:21.680 --> 58:25.920]  what was it, ATOM, A-T-O-M, the Intel Atom architecture.
[58:26.880 --> 58:31.440]  Kind of a third-rate Intel thing, like intentionally sort of spec to run in a very
[58:31.440 --> 58:36.960]  tight network. Well, and no fans at all. Yeah, it was very cool. And I know people who loved it.
[58:36.960 --> 58:42.560]  I really do, especially people who, for obvious reasons, the type of people who have
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.600]  jobs where either they're traveling all the time or even when they're quote unquote at work,
[58:49.600 --> 58:54.320]  they don't really have a desk where they spend all day. They're moving around all day and they
[58:54.320 --> 58:57.920]  need to take their computer with them. Well, obviously making it as thin and light as possible
[58:57.920 --> 59:03.520]  means you're schlepping the least amount around. Yeah, I really love mine. I know our friend Rob
[59:03.520 --> 59:10.160]  Ryan swore by it. He would take all his meetings and just pop it. It just shows that both at two
[59:10.160 --> 59:19.760]  extremes, the 2013 Mac Pro and the 12-inch MacBook showed or proved that Apple needed to take its
[59:19.760 --> 59:28.080]  silicon story into its own hands because left to the industry state of the art, they weren't getting
[59:28.080 --> 59:34.160]  chips that enabled them to build the computers that they imagined. They needed to do it. And I
[59:34.160 --> 59:42.400]  feel like that's where they are forever. And I don't think Nvidia is just the new Intel
[59:43.920 --> 59:52.240]  in terms of being PC oriented, the best performance, but they're building things that
[59:52.240 --> 59:59.120]  are not commensurate with Apple's imagination for the performance per watt characteristics
[59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.040]  of how a high-end graphics card should work. So Apple needs to do it themselves.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.040]  And the other thing about the trashcan that I think makes me optimistic is that it's clear from
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.760]  the trashcan forward that Apple knew how important GPUs were to the future of computing. And so
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:24.000]  Man, I think this is one of the first arguments I had with Syracuse back in
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.480]  97, something like that. Not a real argument, but with OS X, or maybe, yeah,
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.800]  probably you would agree with Syracuse on this because you guys are both older Mac people than
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:39.440]  I am. But with OS X, everything was buffered and the windows were slow, incredibly slow to be
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.400]  drawn. My position was like, yeah, sure, but they're using the GPU to composite all of this
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:50.800]  and the future will be better. I have since getting to know you better. And just my product,
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.280]  my appreciation for products has sort of changed over the years. And I do think that like,
[01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.720]  I think it was the right thing to do. And I think it stank at the time. And I think it made a lot of
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.880]  sense for people to remain on macOS for the year or two that it took to sort of get a little bit
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.760]  better. On the other hand, the entire industry now runs like that. Everybody has like a compositing
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.560]  thing. You're all drawn to a back buffer. It all gets composited. That's how it works. Linux does
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.640]  it. Windows has done it for years. And that's sort of when they took GPUs, started to take GPUs
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:28.640]  more seriously. I think the 2013 was a big bet on taking GPUs more seriously as general compute.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:34.240]  And that's why they introduced OpenCL effectively alongside it, which was sort of their version of
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.600]  CUDA, except if CUDA was DirectX, to stick to the Microsoft knowledge, if CUDA was direct through
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:47.520]  the DirectX, the Windows, Microsoft only API, then CUDA was sort of equivalent on the compute side.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:54.160]  They wanted an OpenGL thing, which was OpenCL to sort of like open that up and have a collective
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.680]  thing. Hey, let's all just do OpenCL rather than getting sucked up in CUDA. Both OpenGL and OpenCL
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.400]  failed for any number of reasons, mostly having to do with the way committees work and a whole bunch
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:10.240]  of... Frankly. And Apple, I'm sure plays great on committees, but moves a lot faster when they're
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.000]  like, you know what, fuck it. We're going to do what we're going to do because we can build the
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.240]  chip and make the thing. So why are we bothered with you guys? I am very, very curious to see
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.680]  how this kind of thing is going to go. And one of the things that they are lacking is games driving
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:34.160]  them forward in terms of GPU. And I think that's been true since forever. I know Marathon has just
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:40.000]  been re-announced, but it's not coming to the Mac, which is heartbreaking even for me. And I'm like...
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:46.320]  Hold that thought. Let's take a break and thank our next sponsor, Squarespace. Oh,

[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.720]  It's I'm a few weeks behind on that. Yeah. So what I might've just, I might've if they've
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.760]  covered stuff that I've said, sorry. I don't know. I haven't.
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.800]  Were you, did you play, I, I forget where you, you just said you weren't as long time
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.920]  Mac user. Did you ever play back in the day? I did, but I came into the Mac in 97 when
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.080]  I didn't say it. The reunification. Yeah. Reunification. When, when, yeah,
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.760]  when I got an ex back. Yeah. So during the reunification, because Steve told me that
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.920]  there would be a, like an open step Mac running in like no time at all. And there, there was not,
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:01.280]  it was 2001. So I had, I had a great Mac. I had like a G three, two 66 with some AV.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.960]  Like I could plug in my my VCR to it. That was cool. And yeah. So
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.200]  system eight, which was amazing. I really liked system eight, 8.5 was great. Like the stuff went
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.760]  to all of the quick drive, I believe went to power PC native. And I really fell in love with
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:24.880]  what the Mac was coming from. Effectively windows NTOS two kind of thing. Like it boggled my mind
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:31.680]  that when you held down on a slider, the Mac would stop because it would be like, you know what,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.360]  this guy really wants to scroll. I'm going to use everything I got to make this.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.840]  The event loop for like mouse down actions was still from like 1984 where it was just,
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.200]  it just, it really was, it was like somewhere low and wild. It was just a while loop while button
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.200]  is still down. There's like some. And it was fricking rat in a cage, just like,
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.080]  I just got to move this cursor. Right. And it had it. I don't know. I, I think
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.520]  somebody, maybe I know, I think Keith Statenfield still at apples. He was like, I think the head
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.560]  engineer on, on at least the last half or the last five years of the classic Mac OS,
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.840]  like some kind of talk or retrospective 20 years later of where the system architecture wound up
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.360]  with Mac OS 8.5 and Mac OS nine Mac OS nine was really good and really, really gave Apple
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.760]  the headroom they needed to let Mac OS 10 establish itself and get off the ground. But it
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:38.400]  was, it was weird. And it was nowhere near as crude as people think there was a kernel,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:45.360]  but it also had to support these ancient API APIs. If they could have said carbon only,
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:51.520]  no software except carbon, they could have used a modern, had a much more modern system architecture.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.960]  That was kind of the Copeland plan, right? Which was new kernel and new kernel. I think there was
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:02.800]  some derivatives that took Mark, but yeah, I, I think you and I were talking about this at Ben
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.560]  in a text chain, how I honestly think carbon is probably a key savior for Apple at the time.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.520]  Oh, without question. During that transition.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.080]  Right. And it's, and it's championed with Scott Forstall who came from next, but was the, not the
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:23.440]  voice of reason, but the voice of practicality like, yes. And nobody was more committed to the
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.560]  future of cocoa and the next technologies that enforced all, but as a practical matter for the
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.840]  late nineties and first few years of the two thousands, they needed it and they modernized
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:39.040]  it. But anyway, in that era, a company who you may have heard of named bungee in December,
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:45.200]  1994, came out with a first person shooter that was Mac only called marathon. And so like the
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:53.760]  weird, I don't know, it was like the tail end of the piece, the windows PC universe and the Mac
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:00.960]  universe being so utterly foreign, right? Like the internet, the internet was the,
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.160]  and as much as carbon saved Apple, the internet saved Apple too, right? Web and the web,
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  because there's everything moved to the, as so much moved to the web as the
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.600]  To pressure off the native apps. Right. And the lowest common denominator,
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.200]  right? So all these companies who were only going to write once and we're going to write
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:22.400]  against win 32 and that left Apple Mac users out in the cold. It, when that shifted to,
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:26.560]  we're only going to write it once and it's going to be in the web. That meant it could run
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.440]  everywhere. So that saved Apple, but you know, floppy disks were formatted differently. The
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:37.840]  apps were entirely different extensions, man. Right. You don't get me started. Don't get me.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:44.000]  So I know, I think it's a necessarily evil and I have for 30 some odd years now, but whatever.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.960]  I don't, they're gross. They're gross for all of the reasons going to be gross.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:53.520]  I was tend to basically introduce them to the Mac gross. We're now living in a,
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:02.400]  we're now living in a world where top-level domain is dot zip and that's bad. Anyway,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.880]  I feel like we're just tripping down memory lane. You're the master of these digressions,
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.160]  the dot zip thing is that Google of all companies who should know better
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.880]  is also a domain name registrar. And one of the new domains that they've launched,
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:23.040]  you can get like guy English dot zip now, which don't download guy English, but that's the actual
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:28.960]  domain name. And it's, if you think about it, it's horrible because if you can put together a URL
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.800]  that's like redirecting and looks like it's something else, it will look like it's a file
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.400]  name dot zip that you're just downloading a file where instead you're actually going to this
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:48.400]  website you didn't intend to go to. It's a bad idea. But at a time when PC users were celebrating
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:55.680]  doom from id software, the groundbreaking first person shooter was PC only, but the Mac had
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.320]  marathon and it obviously is not as popular as doom because the Mac was smaller, but in its weird
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:10.000]  ways, I played both as a Mac, zillions of PC users in the nineties who never got to play marathon
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.720]  because they didn't have any, they didn't know where they could use a Mac. Whereas a Mac user,
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.800]  I had seen doom and played doom, very different game. Doom was really just pure,
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.400]  just go there and blow apart anything that moves and marathon had a story, a really,
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.000]  really interesting way. Yeah. The bungee way. Yeah. I think for those of you out there who
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.480]  were either too young or weren't Mac users in the nineties, bungee of course went on to make
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:43.040]  the halo franchise. Now they're best known for the destiny franchise, which all of my adult friends
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:48.880]  who do play video games are addicted, addicted to, but Hey, if you played halo, which I did play,
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.560]  that was one of the last games I played. Halo was so marathon like, and in fact, I think,
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.560]  I don't know if it was a different time or something, but it took place in the greater
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.920]  marathon universe and they had Easter eggs buried, but the way that there was stories and
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:11.520]  talk about relevant to today's world, there was an, there were, I think, dueling AI constructs
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.040]  in the marathon world where you'd be running around the spaceship, shooting these aliens,
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:25.600]  and you'd get to a console. And some of the AIs were unhelpful, just a fantastic game. And
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.880]  it was a great first person or single player game with a great story that was very, very engrossing
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.160]  and rich the game. It's the engine was innovative and powerful and had things that I don't think
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.480]  doom even had, like it was meant to, I believe you could look up and down. Yeah. You could look
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.720]  up and down with the mouse. And so you weren't just playing on a 2d map. You were playing 3d
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:56.640]  and where to me, it's just doubt right down memory lane. And it's just amazingly warm memories was
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:02.960]  the multiplayer. Now, multiplayer in that time, absolutely positively couldn't take place over
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:09.120]  the broader internet. So it was the quote unquote land party, but like the no modem,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.520]  like, no, but I only played at the school newspaper. So at Drexel, I came out in 94,
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:22.000]  it came out in 94. I graduated at the end of 96 or June 96. And I hung around for another
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.080]  year in the area and still friends with the paper. So he played, but the school newspaper
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:33.680]  at Drexel, the triangle we had, we didn't, we made real money with real ads, good money, nobody,
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:40.640]  and all the entire staff was volunteer. So we didn't pay the editors or writers. We just,
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:46.400]  it's a good way to make money. That's what studios are doing. We traded, we traded ad space
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:54.240]  to local restaurants in exchange for free food. So we got instead of money, so we could eat dinner
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:00.080]  four or five nights a week at the paper. So we, I got to eat food and then we would just spend all
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:07.280]  of the money we made from advertising, printing the actual newspaper and buying expensive Macintosh
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.760]  computers and laser printers. That's a, that's a great scab. Yeah. You don't have to pay. It's
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:19.840]  like, yeah. So, and we have the off the office space was what was provided to student clubs
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:25.760]  at any university. There's all sorts of student organizations. There's amazing. Yeah. That is
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:30.880]  like, we had a nice corner office. I hope they're still there. I haven't, I haven't been in touch
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.880]  with anybody at the triangle for a long time, but, but we spent all the money on expensive
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.160]  Macintosh hardware and we had, it's a nerdy engineering school. And so we had
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:47.440]  a very good land for ourselves and we'd upgrade the ethernet whenever we could. So we had,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:53.440]  I don't know, a eight to 10 high-end max that we're all, so we're all in the same room with
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:01.680]  nice displays and we, and we would just stay up all night. Just, just the eight, 10 hours
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:07.120]  like blowing, blowing each other. I want to do that now. Don't you want to do that now?
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  Until you realize like, I don't want to be up. No, I don't want to be up on that. I don't know
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.200]  that. I like that. I like the vibe of it, but like the actual effort put in is like,
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.960]  it was just amazingly fun. And it was just a tremendously fun game multiplayer like that
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.880]  with some great levels and including the mouse look thing. I remember, I don't remember the
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.720]  names of the levels, but my favorite level was this one where anybody who played, it was sort
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:38.480]  of like a big, big arena with a stage in the middle. And that stage was where the best weapons
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.440]  would appear. And so you'd, you'd end there like these snipers coming down. Yeah. And there'd be
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.600]  teleport spots where you'd try to teleport up there and that's where you'd go to get the weapons.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.800]  And then you'd have to like do quick jump off. But meanwhile, people would position themselves
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:16:00.080]  up in the, you know, like in the last Batman movie when Bane sent them to some weird jail
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.080]  over in the Middle East, he had a climb up. It was like that type of circular long, you know,
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:12.880]  real big. Yeah. But you could teleport to these alcoves that were up there. And one of the weapons
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.160]  was a rocket launcher. So you could just get up there, point your rocket launcher where you knew
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:24.320]  the best weapons would spawn on that stage down below. And then boom, just blow people apart the
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:32.000]  second they got there. It was so fun. And it was one of the, it was a game where the more you had
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.280]  memorized the maps and you knew all the spawn locations, the respawn. The other thing that you
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:43.440]  could do is you could take a guess when you killed somebody, guess where they might respawn
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.440]  and already point there. And that was the, that was like the best would be like, let's say I killed
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:56.160]  you. And then I've still got the rocket launcher and I take a guess where you might appear and I'm
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.440]  already aimed there. And then lo and behold, I guessed, right. Boom. You're dead again. One
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:06.480]  second later. And it tells you. There are thousands of you devoted listeners who are
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:11.520]  realizing that you are a jackass like that. I was the worst camper, man. You're just camping. Yeah.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.760]  Yeah. And I think that's the wrong way. I'm not surprised, but that is satisfying when you like,
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.360]  you feel like you're in the zone, like, okay, I killed this guy. I know he's going to come back.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:27.760]  Yeah. Yeah. And you've got no chance. You literally, there's nothing you could do. You
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.200]  could be the best marathon player in the world and there's nothing you could do. If the half a second
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.640]  after you respond, there's already a rocket coming right at your face. Cause you can time it. You
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.280]  know how long they'll take you respond. If I fire now, he'll just, he'll teleport right in front of
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.840]  it. Yeah. Yeah. So you know, the way the kids today, like when they're playing the Fortnite
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.160]  or those games and they, they pay the money to get the dance moves and stuff like that,
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.920]  that they can do. But when you were playing in a land in a room altogether, you would just stand
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.720]  up and do the dance for real and just put your finger right in the guy. I mean, it's amazing.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:08.320]  I didn't get beaten up. I mean, frankly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's like a lifelong. Well,
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:16.000]  anyway, anyway, marathon it's coming back. It's but it's coming back in an entirely new,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.640]  it's like they're using bungee is using the intellectual property from marathon
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:26.960]  to make a new game. It's called an extraction something. I don't know. It sounds to me like
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.320]  you play, it's sort of like a more like a Fortnite type thing, but Fortnite is
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.760]  20 randos around the world, get put on an Island together and the last person alive wins
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.480]  these extraction games. I think it's like, you have to, you have to get to like a certain point
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.960]  on the map and maybe there's two teams or something like that and capture the flag. I don't know.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:51.200]  I think that the, I don't know the class of the names of them. There was a Star Wars game like
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:56.160]  that though, that I think, I think this might be modeled after you could be like Han Solo or
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:01.680]  Darth Vader. Yeah, maybe, maybe that was it. I didn't play it. I watched Jonas play it, but
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.200]  anyway, marathon's coming back in name only. Maybe it'll be fun. I don't know. But the sad
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:12.800]  part about it is what you said. It's it. And it's Sony, Sony bought bungee bungee went from
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:18.400]  being a Mac only. This is where it's sad from a Mac users part. They used to make,
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:24.080]  they used to make Mac Mac games only, and they made the best Mac games and were the,
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.480]  the only company making games that if you could get a PC user's attention, they would say,
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:35.360]  huh, that actually does look like a good game. They, halo was going to debut as a Mac game,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:40.880]  just like marathon, but then a small company named Microsoft bought bungee. But then halo
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.560]  became what Mario is to Nintendo platforms. Halo was to the Xbox. It was the exclusive
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.360]  and it got me. I honestly, that's the reason I bought at the original. I bought the original
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:58.320]  Xbox in 99 or 2000, whatever year it came out. Instead of buying whatever the original Xbox
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:02.800]  whatever the PlayStation two or whatever the PlayStation was at the time, because I wanted
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.400]  halo, I knew I wanted it because I knew I loved marathon. It did come out for the Mac eventually
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.760]  halo, but it was bad. I played it on my Mac and it was a port by another company. It was fine.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:19.200]  It was good, but it didn't have that magic. Yeah. Bungee's got magic when they put their
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.440]  hardens or something. It's magic. And I, I can just ports are complicated and difficult
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.600]  because you want to maintain the same thing, but you know, you feel like the Mac people at
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.800]  bungee would have put some great Mac twist on it in some weird way. Yeah. For reasons I still
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:40.960]  don't understand Microsoft sold bungee eventually. And now Sony owns bungee. It, it seems weird
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:46.560]  given that Microsoft is interested in buying EA. They obviously want to own intellectual property
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:53.040]  and game studios and want to spend Microsoft's trying to buy wait, no. Well, what's the parent
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.440]  company of EA? Whatever. No, no. It's Activision you're thinking of. Oh yeah. That's right.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:05.600]  Activision is, but doesn't Activision own EA? Do they? Oh, whatever. Man.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:17.360]  Yeah. I guess the EU is doing their thing where it's Activision. I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.880]  And it's a weird, whatever. It shows what a dummy I am at remembering
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:30.560]  names. It's Activision, of course, but anyway, but for some reason they want to spend $68 billion
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.040]  to buy Activision, but didn't want to keep bungee. And now Sony owns bungee and destiny is
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.080]  beloved. And now they're coming out with this new marathon game and it's only going to be for
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:46.640]  PlayStation, X-Box and PC. Ooh. But I guess I understand why. Right. It would have been,
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:53.120]  well, it would have been awesome if they said and Mac, but I guess the other thing does do a great
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:59.760]  job of like courting game developers. I really don't. I like Apple arcade. I do. But one of the
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.840]  big problems with that is if you are just to some background, I know, but for the listeners, I worked
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.880]  at Ubisoft at the beginning of my career was all in video games. And I was at Ubisoft at one point
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.520]  and the console makers have very strict HIG, like a human interface guideline. And they will reject
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:25.840]  you if you don't comply with it. Like if you in every game button X does Y like it does it. And,
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.160]  and you don't need to read the instructions. It's just I'm on my X-Box. I know if I do this,
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.480]  it's going to do an affirmative action. If I do that, it's not the menus work a certain way.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:41.760]  Everything kind of has a formula, like a HIG and it's good. Apple lets people bring their games
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:48.160]  over, but doesn't really provide a HIG for what the game should do really. And so they're kind of
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.760]  like all over the map and they don't feel unified as, as, as a concept. This is under Apple arcade
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:00.400]  games, not under Apple arcade. Just want to upsell you, but it's horrible. Like it's,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.200]  it's just seems like a mess of all kinds of stuff. Apple arcade is good,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:08.880]  but I wish they'd have a stronger communication and a stronger opinion when dealing with game
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.040]  developers, which I think would be of their platform and courting them and listening to them
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.520]  sort of the same way that they, I don't want them to don't want them. They've clearly succeeded in
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:25.120]  television. And I think succeeding in games in a similar way would really work for the company.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:30.560]  And I think they're going to need to hire some outside people in order to help them
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.280]  achieve that. If that's even something they want to achieve.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.400]  Well, I'll hold that thought. Let's shift to the headset where I think
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.760]  maybe that's where that might go, but let's hold that thought. And let me thank our third
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.960]  and final sponsor of the show. Our good friends at Collide, K O L I D E. They've got big news.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.080]  If you're an Okta user, they can get your entire fleet of devices to a hundred percent compliance.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.360]  Now, how can they do that? How does it work? They patch one of the major holes
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:06.080]  in zero trust architecture, and that's device compliance. Without Collide, IT departments
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:12.080]  struggle to solve basic problems like keeping everyone's operating systems and browsers up to
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:17.920]  date with security patches and updates. Insecure devices are logging into your company's apps right
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.520]  now because there's nothing to stop them. Collide is the only device trust solution that enforces
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:30.080]  compliance as part of user authentication, and it's built to work seamlessly with Okta.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:36.400]  The moment Collide's agent detects a problem, it alerts the user and gives them simple,
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:41.760]  easy to follow instructions for how to fix it. If they don't fix the problem within a set time,
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:46.240]  then they're blocked from logging in to your internal apps. It's that simple.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.240]  Collide's method means fewer support tickets, less frustration, and most importantly,
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:59.920]  100% fleet compliance. Visit collide.com slash the talk show to learn more or book a demo.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:05.920]  That's K-O-L-I-D-E collide.com slash the talk show.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.680]  All right, onward to the headset. And I think games are a good segue.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:17.280]  Yeah. Because we're going to find out what Apple thinks the answer to the question.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:23.840]  Okay, we get it. They're making a headset, apparently. I mean, again, we could all be
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:31.680]  in for a big surprise in a week. I don't expect that to happen. I think somebody inside Apple
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.080]  would have started spreading the word to stop expecting a headset by now. So let's just...
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.400]  Yeah, I mean, that notion's come up a few times, right? Which is, I forget if it was Jason on the
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:47.680]  show. Basically, I'm just here to pitch previous episodes of the show. But yeah, basically, if
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.360]  things are getting out of hand in terms of expectations, it behooves Apple to be like,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.440]  hey, guess what? Just chill out because don't get too excited.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.960]  So if we spend all this podcast time talking about the expectation of a headset next week,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:08.720]  and it doesn't come... It's not us who look foolish. It's Apple. At this point.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:16.000]  Yes. Right. Exactly. Also, I don't want to talk about it. And I'll tell you why. A,
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.840]  I think you and Jason covered it really well. I love the sports stuff. I know a friend,
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.200]  Chris Parrish, and you and I were all texting about similar stuff earlier with regards to
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:30.400]  soccer rather than baseball. Seeing games up front is cool. I like all of that notion.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:38.480]  Who knows what's going to happen? What I am interested in is not the specifics of the
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.320]  product, which eventually if it exists, we'll see it. It'll be announced soon enough. So
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.160]  what's the point in really drawing on that? I think that that gun has been covered. Is
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:57.040]  what new ways of interacting with computers do we expect? Not just with this potential device,
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:03.680]  but I think the humane stuff fits into this too. The company humane, you're saying?
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.680]  The company humane. Yeah. And I know they're drastically different concepts at this point,
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:13.200]  but effectively, if you forget whatever the specifics are going to be, like Quinn did a
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.560]  great job. You've had a really great... I'm sorry you stuck with me this week. You've had
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:23.840]  a great long run. You should definitely get Joanna back on because she's amazing. But I
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.040]  appreciate it. It's either me or Molt's just filling it out. Quinn Nelson was awesome though.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.240]  He was awesome. Yeah. It was great. Yeah. I love it. I haven't listened to last week,
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:40.560]  but I'm sure they're great too. The notion of the humane device is one that does not require
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.960]  a phone and is sort of as presented, fits in the lapel pocket and projects stuff. I guess
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:53.360]  my take on this and potential glasses are that computing becomes an environmental factor.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.160]  If it's not clipped onto your lapel, but you've got four of them scattered around,
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:01.920]  like aerotatics in your kitchen, whatever you address, it'll project something and you can
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.320]  interact with it, or it's on your glasses and you can see wherever in the world that you happen to
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:15.200]  be. This is sort of an ambient computing kind of take with connectivity and connectivity.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:23.040]  With connectivity and AI, hopefully providing input in terms of being able to understand what
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.880]  it is you want and output in terms of being able to hopefully find you an answer. I think maybe
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:36.000]  let's put aside the caveats about how AI just makes shit up sometimes and assume that that's
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.440]  going to be okay. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure that that's a good assumption, but let's just
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:48.640]  assume that the people developing this technology think that that's going to be okay. Both either
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:54.320]  having glasses or a humane style device leads to an ambient computing sort of experience.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:02.560]  What does that mean? What's different? Where's the world in 10 years? Not like,
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.680]  hey, in six months, are we going to pay X amount of dollars for a couple of either a humane device
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:12.640]  or some potential glasses? Well, you know that I always walk around with a notebook in my back
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.960]  pocket, right? I'm a field notes junkie and it's a decades-long habit at this point where
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.960]  something comes to my mind or it's like, wait, I got to do these three things today.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:27.600]  Don't let me forget them. You've been using it during this conversation.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:35.360]  I do. We're on camera, by the way. But it is something that I have to think about. I think,
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.800]  oh, there's something I want to write down. I want to make sure I go to the dry cleaner before
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.840]  the end of the day. I take out my notebook, I write it down. And that's like, in a broad
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.440]  analogy, that's like what computers have been like at this point. Like, oh, I want to do something on
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.840]  a computer. Let me open my laptop and start typing. Let me take my phone out of my pocket and
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:57.200]  tap, tap, tap. Ambient computing is more like if you had somebody following you around who's
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:02.080]  writing everything down on a notebook all the time and you don't have to do it. And then you're like,
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:06.400]  you just turned to your assistant like, what? Where the hell did I have lunch last Tuesday?
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.000]  And they're like, flip, flip, flip through the pages. Oh, you had lunch at Shake Shack.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.600]  And it's like, oh, yeah, that's right. But it's just there, right? And yes,
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:24.720]  technology is always surprising when it comes to fruition. And however visionary our science
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:31.680]  fiction authors of decades past were, they always miss some things. Nobody can forget
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:38.400]  it. Nobody can foresee it. And it's like, nobody really foresaw like, what if AI becomes a real
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:45.200]  thing and a practical thing people can use? And it's really dumb. Like, nobody envisioned that.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:50.560]  Nobody envisioned. Everybody's idea was that the AIs, no matter what, whether they went bad,
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.400]  or they didn't go bad, that they were smarter than the humans, right? And, you know, C-3PO.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:01.520]  Hal9000 had a plan. He was like, I'm going to get him out of the ship. I'm going to close
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:09.520]  the door. It made sense. Hal was very smart. C-3PO is very smart. And it was original to think,
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.480]  well, what if he's a bit annoying? What if he's a bit of a worry wart?
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.240]  Ultimately, he is a know-it-all. It's not that he's dumb. It's not that he doesn't know a thing.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.520]  He's just, he's a know-it-all. Yeah. And what if an R2, what if R2, what if there's a robot
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.240]  and all it can do is beep, but is very sarcastic and is a bit of his cocky smart ass? But he was
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:35.840]  smart, right? There was nobody envisioned the idea that what if the AI comes and it's just really
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.560]  dumb? You can spend five minutes with it and convince it to two plus two equals five. You
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:45.200]  know what I mean? Like people have done that. But it's where we're going, right? And the headset
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:52.880]  will be the first step or one of the first steps. I still say AirPods are one of those steps, right?
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:00.240]  Exactly. Exactly. That's kind of where I'm going with that is like, it's sort of, sure, VR, AR stuff
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:05.120]  is possibly a product. It's definitely this humane thing as demonstrated at least seems to be the
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:11.280]  same kind of thing. But ultimately the mechanism through which be it AirPods or whatever other
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:17.360]  kind of stuff is incidental to the actual experience. I can just get stuff projected
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:21.760]  in front of my eyes, whether it's from a projector in the room or like something that I'm wearing or
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.160]  ambient noise detection in my AirPods, which I, the transparency mode in AirPods is pretty
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:32.000]  incredible. It'll dampen out a whole bunch of stuff. But like when I'm about to get hit by
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.200]  something, I know it doesn't happen because I know that it's there. I forget that it's on all the
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.560]  time. And I use them as a pedestrian in a big city with lots of traffic all the time. And I think as
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:48.480]  like a truck goes by or a bus goes by and I hear it, I think, Oh, I should put transparency on.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.600]  And then I hold it to put transparency on. And then I hear what really is going on in the real
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.720]  world. I was like, Oh, it was on. And that was just letting me know. It's it's fantastic. It's
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:03.360]  really, really good, but it really is. It disappears. Right. And it's exactly that is
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:07.600]  an ambient computing where you literally forget you're using it. You're supposed to forget you're
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:13.040]  using it when you're using them on an airplane and you've got the noise cancellation on.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:18.560]  You just completely forget that airplanes are very noisy. You know, that the white noise,
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.920]  the baseline white noise on an airplane is really high and you just completely forget it. Because I
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.400]  one thing I always do is I always take them out when I go to take a leak on an airplane,
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:33.120]  because I'm super duper quadruple. That's the last place you want to lose an airplane. They
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:37.360]  never fall out of my ears. I've never I everyone's in a while they'll fall out on a sidewalk. I've
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:43.280]  never lost one. But I just know Murphy's law says that the most likely place would be like,
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.880]  I'm halfway through a piss and the airplane hit some turbulence. Am I right? Today,
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:54.400]  flight ground against John Gruber got his arm stuck. Oh, no, I'd kiss it goodbye. That's for
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:03.040]  sure. 0.0% chance that I'm fishing an air pod out of there. But I know I worried. I guess those
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.600]  those airplane toilets, they have a real powerful sort of vacuum flush. But I'd be worried that it
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.040]  would just be sitting there and I couldn't flush it down. And the next guy would come in and be
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:18.480]  like, Oh, an air pod. Yeah. So the thing is, it's like, sure, games obviously makes sense. But I
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.800]  feel like games are sorry for the headset games. We know what that is. Right. And so the next kind
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:33.520]  of thing is, well, what is an AR? An AR is not just glasses. It's not ears. It is really sort
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:41.040]  of an ambient experience. And I think your explanation of ambient makes the most sense,
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.560]  which is it's just constantly competing with you, which presupposes or is predicated upon the
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:55.840]  notion of constantly recording stuff, which is creepy. And I guess my thesis is that Apple's
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:02.720]  investment, both in terms of technology and in terms of communication in privacy over the past
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:08.320]  many, many years. In their brand, right? Advertising. It's their brand now. There's
[01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.040]  billboards within the Apple logo and a lock on top. Do you know how often you mutilate your logo?
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:18.560]  Yeah. Not often. They do it with a lock because they want you to know. And I think that in terms
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:25.200]  of whatever product lines you watch, you watch also inherently very personal information.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:32.320]  The notion that in order to achieve or to be trusted in this new space of more ambient
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:39.920]  computing, you must take this very, very cultural signifier seriously. And I think you can come
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.760]  out with products that are maybe cool or interesting, but unless you've built trust
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:52.080]  over years, it's going to be a very difficult sell. Yeah. I'm super excited at this point. I
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.840]  know it's clear from the last couple of episodes of the show and Jason and I talked about it and
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.680]  I've talked about it with Molts and other people and Quinn. Quinn especially is one of the reasons
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.480]  I had him on because he did such a good video. Projecting some of these ideas of what you could
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:11.440]  do. I'm super duper curious what Apple's answer to that question is, but at this point,
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:16.560]  if it's sufficiently good hardware and the latency's low, I can imagine that all sorts
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:23.040]  of things are going to be really cool and useful on a headset. I really am. I wonder,
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:28.960]  I mean, and the weird thing about Apple and gaming is as much as the Mac is perhaps as
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:36.960]  little relevant to overall PC gaming as it's ever been. I mean, I think that's on it.
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.320]  It's funny because it's more capable than it's ever been. More capable at the nadir of
[01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:49.040]  actually having games on it. You name the games that people who consider themselves gamers are
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.160]  playing and the number of them that are available on the Mac is you count them on one hand, I think,
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:00.400]  maybe even if you've lost a couple fingers in a lawnmower accident, you still might be able to
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:06.400]  count them on one hand. Yet, Apple is arguably maybe the most profitable gaming company in the
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:14.000]  world with the iPhone, right? I'm not looking up the numbers. I may not even be close. I mean,
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:22.960]  honestly, and so there is a lot of game source code out there that is targeted towards Apple
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.920]  Silicon, but it's on the phone and does that translate? That's a market thing. I mean, so
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.360]  well, it is. It is a market thing, right? Yeah. I mean, so yeah, that's kind of what it's going.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:38.400]  You know this. I'm not as public as I used to be, but at one point back in the early iPhone days,
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:44.960]  I worked on tap, tap revenge, which was a big hit and basically a dance dance revolution style game
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:51.280]  on the phone slash guitar hero type guitar hero that that style sort of MIDI notes would come
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.520]  down. You tap him and it was, it was a sensation. It really, I'm not saying that just because you
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:01.440]  worked on it. I mean, it was absolutely a sensation. Yeah. It blew my mind. Yeah. In fact,
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.160]  the company tactically set up getting bought by Disney, right? So that's cool. I still get emails
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:12.800]  from Disney telling me about just dumb internal stuff. Anyway, long story short games were cool
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:20.800]  and yet never really the focus. I like one of my proudest moments is jobs on stage playing tap,
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.920]  tap revenge, multitasking was added. It's like, Hey, look, I can get out of this dumb game and
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  go do something useful and then come back and the game is still there. That was the demo of
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:36.240]  multitasking. And I'm like, that's very Steve jobs. And I like that, but it's, I don't think
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:41.920]  the company's ever really had a strong advocate for games. And I, I, I think it is a testament
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:50.320]  to how well constructed and the culture of the company that they've had so many long term managers
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.640]  and, and they have adapted in so many ways to the changing environment in terms of computing
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.040]  and in terms of the capabilities of the chips, in terms of software, in terms of the internet.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.320]  And at the same time, none of these people at games and I don't really play games. I play FIFA
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.040]  every now and then, but it's like, we, I'm not, and you're not one of those people that goes and
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:15.040]  plays land parties anymore, but there are people there. And in terms of advancing in games, I think
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.600]  you need an advocate for that kind of thing. Well, maybe it's Shiller though. I mean, and again, I
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:25.280]  did, I, it's not like Phil Shiller calls me up a month before WWDC and tells me what's on the
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:29.360]  agenda, quite the opposite, but we do know, I don't even know how, I think we know this from
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:34.000]  the Epic lawsuit. It came out in testimony that Phil Shiller, number one, he knows a lot more
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:39.520]  about games than you might think. And he has like a, I don't know if it simulates F1 specifically,
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:45.280]  but like a, a race, a VR race car simulator at his house. That's cool. Like, imagine what Phil
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.200]  Shiller money could buy you in terms of how nice it's probably, you know what I mean? Like, it's
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.080]  probably got like a really nice steering wheel. It's not just Phil Shiller money without Steve
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.080]  bomber taste. Steve bomber would just buy an F1 car and race it himself like Tony Stark. No,
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:05.040]  you know, you know, Phil's setup looks good too. Like it looks good even before you're playing it
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:12.240]  as high level as anybody at Apple can get, who's obviously got a keen interest in and experience
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:17.760]  with VR gaming. I guess the other thing I would just, I don't want to focus too much on games
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:22.960]  just with the headset, but I do think it's gotta be a huge part of the story. And in one sense,
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:29.280]  I guess the way I'm looking at it is that old Axiom that if you're going to be the upstart
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:36.080]  and take over the entrenched incumbent, you can't just be two X better. You've got to be 10 X
[01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:41.440]  better. It's not a magic number. If you could put a number on it and it's actually 8.5 X better.
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.160]  Well, that's closer. It rounds up to 10, but you've got to be like roughly an order of magnitude
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.640]  better. Where Apple's strength in gaming is clearly on handheld phones, right? And men,
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.480]  one level up probably iPad. I'll bet the second, by far the second most amount of money they get
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:05.280]  from app store gaming revenue is on the iPad, not the Apple TV or Mac. And that's the phone is even
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.760]  the biggest phone iPhone you could buy is a relatively small, really relatively small
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.360]  viewport. It's less immersive because it comes back to, I think I was talking about it with
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:25.200]  Snell recently about how immersive going to a real movie theater is because the screen is so big.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:31.280]  There is a psychological aspect to it that it makes it more immersive than watching on your
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:39.280]  TV at home. No matter how big your TV is, it just is your mind gets full PC gaming with a big PC
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.320]  gaming monitor right in front of you is way more immersive than gaming on a phone because it's a
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.360]  bigger screen and that you've got better controls. But what can be more immersive than even the
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:57.200]  nicest display in front of you is that your whole field of view, right? And that could simulate
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:06.560]  the illusion that you're looking at reality, that it's not a big 35 inch display in front of you.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:12.880]  It's literally the world. It's that immersive. So to me, if Apple's ambition is to become like
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:20.560]  a leading gamer gaming platform, not just a casual gaming platform, I honestly, it would make sense
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.160]  strategically to say, you know what? We lost this battle with the PC class gaming. Let's go to the
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:34.880]  next thing, which is full immersion of VR. That would make sense to me. And then all of a sudden,
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.560]  instead of the Mac versus the PC, it's okay, you're stuck on a PC looking at a stupid display
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:45.280]  or you've got one of these janky headsets that are out there for PCs attached to it,
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.680]  like a PlayStation, which are, I mean, they're great. They look great. I don't have one,
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:56.320]  but yeah. Well, like I said, I said last week in terms of how much he's attached to it,
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.040]  he didn't even take it to college with him. He did take his PlayStation, didn't take the headset.
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.080]  I mean, that's how much he cares about the headset.
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.040]  About Star Wars Squadrons a while ago, I don't know when it came out,
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:13.200]  which is, guess what? You fly an X-wing or a TIE fighter, but it supports the headset.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.880]  And I liked the game, but I never even bought the headset. I was like, okay, well,
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:26.480]  I'm not really called to spend that much extra money. I do think that VR is a distinctly
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.920]  different thing than AR, right? And one of the great things that they do have going in
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:40.000]  and to their advantage, just, I mean, all of Mac OS and iOS devices, except the watch, I guess,
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  support game controllers. So whatever, if they strap something to your face and you can use a
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.200]  game controller, that's great. Obviously there are PlayStation games where you can interact
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:55.280]  more physically in the environment, but I feel like if you're on a long haul flight,
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.680]  you're not going to get up and dance around the cabin.
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:01.760]  Trenton Larkin Imagine flailing your arms while you're sitting there and you're like slapping
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:03.680]  the guy next to you in the face.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.880]  David Bonilla Right. Yeah. You're getting ejected pretty
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:08.320]  quick. Yeah. I do like your...
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:12.560]  Trenton Larkin You're knocking your own drink off your seat tray table. No,
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:15.440]  you need like... You want your hands to stay still and be...
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.920]  David Bonilla I think there's two different experiences there. I think there was an
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.920]  experience, like at least for the things that I've tried, the VR, the PlayStation stuff,
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:30.960]  and the Oculus, there is an experience where you are part of the world and your whole body is sort
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.920]  of incorporated into it. And that's one thing. There's also a concept of like, oh, it's just
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:44.800]  a giant ass screen in front of your face. Like the Game Boy worked great because you could just sit
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.200]  there and play it and it was fun and it was pretty compact. You could sit and play it on the bus.
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.440]  I don't know if you've seen that Tetris movie, but man, it's pretty good.
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.840]  Trenton Larkin I did. No, I did see the Tetris movie. I loved it.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.560]  David Bonilla It was, interestingly,
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.480]  it's not what I expected. It is not a spy thriller, but it's not a spy thriller. It's not a
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:09.200]  comedy. They're driving cars and when they bump, they glitch, which is weird. Like there was some
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:15.200]  very weird artistic things. Parts of it may as well just be a stage play. Like there was his
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.400]  apartment, there was a meeting room and there was maybe his hotel. Oh, and a club at one point. Like
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:27.360]  it's so limited in terms of like what happens. Great movie. Well, great. Very interesting. Worth
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:35.840]  checking out. I guess what I'm saying is the way that you engage with a full, under full immersion
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.160]  can either be a full body experience or it can just be like a very personal experience.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:48.960]  One of them requires basically a room that is padded. How many coffee tables are you going to
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:56.000]  fall into? And one of them could be like a little bit more confined. And I think games
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:02.320]  need to realize like, what is this platform and what's it doing? And I think part of the reason
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.280]  that is kind of pointless to talk about this potential device until next week is we don't
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:15.600]  know. We have no idea. We can guess all we want, but ultimately it is, what is it for? Who knows?
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.600]  Like, what's the UI? Who knows? Who knows what the goal is? Is it a Game Boy that you can sit
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.760]  and just enjoy quietly? Or is it like, clear out your living room, kids? We're going into VR
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:35.840]  adventure. Those are very different things. And I think ultimately VR is a stop along the way
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:42.080]  to like sort of a more augmented reality thing, which is where I was going with the humane devices
[01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:48.480]  at the earphones and all. Yeah. I think if it's successful and if it's ambitious, as I suspect
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:53.600]  it is, and you know, there's rumors that it's going to cost $3,000, which I know is very
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.440]  expensive for a consumer product, but as I've said, like inflation adjusted the original Macintosh
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:06.880]  from 1984. It was $2,500 then. That's like over $7,000 now just to get the one and only Macintosh.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:13.040]  I mean, in the 90s, Silicon Graphics and Sun workstations, it was $20,000 just to get a computer
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:20.000]  on your desk on those platforms. And in that era is money. So I'm not saying that $3,000 headset
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.760]  is nothing if that's the price, but it to me is exciting if it is. Let's just say it is $3,000.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:34.560]  It just means that it's got to be really exciting technology. Like if an iPhone 14 Pro is $1,000,
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:42.720]  how much cool computing power could three times that be packed in front of your eyes,
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:47.840]  like by Apple's current engineering standards? You're not even talking about the paradigms for
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:52.320]  how the software is going to work, which is the most interesting thing to me. But you know that
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:57.840]  they've got the Silicon chops to do it. Like they may not have the chops to do it and sell it for
[01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:04.560]  $750 yet. That's the five years in the future. But if they're going to pack $3,000 of their current,
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.840]  this is the best we can do into a headset, that should be a really impressive hardware device,
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:18.720]  like as a computer. Sure. With that much money, whatever the bill of materials is. Yes,
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:26.560]  that totally makes sense. But ultimately, why? Do you know what I mean? It's like, could you do
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:32.800]  that? Could you strap that much worth of compute onto your face or whatever it is? Sure. And I
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:39.280]  guess I'm going back to the Mac Pro, the 2023 concept of a Mac Pro. Why? What is it you're
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.840]  trying to achieve? What is the purpose of this? And if you can sort of glean the purpose, which
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:50.960]  I don't think we can, then maybe you can sort of guess what technology would be. But I don't think
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:57.360]  that like, hey, we've got this much tech. Let's throw it at somebody or at a device and see what
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:04.240]  happens. That feels a little initially backwards, but potentially kind of like the watch, like,
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:11.120]  hey, let's try something and see where it goes. And I think going back to the last 15 years of
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.040]  major introductions, like the iPhone introduction didn't really need the why, right? Everybody had
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:26.800]  phones and iPods. But the one outlier was like an iPod. What was it? An iPod, a phone, an internet
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:32.400]  communicator. And everybody's like, oh, that's bullshit. You wanted the rule of three. Guess what
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:38.080]  everybody does? It's like the third one. But for the most part, once Jobs started demoing it,
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.400]  everybody was just like, gimme, gimme, gimme, I need it. Whereas with the iPad,
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:47.840]  the whole keynote was why, why, why did we build this? What is the point? It was very explicit.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.840]  It wasn't like hinting at why. Steve Jobs literally said, what is the slide? As I recall,
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:50:00.240]  it was like a MacBook on one side, an iPhone on the other. Is there space in the middle for
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:07.600]  something that is sort of like a phone and sort of like a laptop? We think, yes, here's why.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  Here's why. And it was this, that, the other. I would expect that would be the exact cadence
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.960]  of the headset introduction. Why? I wouldn't be surprised if they actually just come right out
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:25.600]  and say it the way Jobs did. Like, why would you want to do this and strap a thing on your face?
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.880]  Well, we've got some answers. This, that, the other.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:36.560]  That does make sense. And I think the question is still open for iPad, right?
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.840]  Right. Well, maybe now what's the point of iPad? You'd be like, I don't know,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.320]  makes a bunch of money. Right. But I think I'm sure the iPad people are very upset with me now,
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.840]  but clearly between the, the max, like the, our max and the phone iPads are getting a little,
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.800]  I think I'd say this as somebody who works on an iPad.
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:01.600]  I think if they're successful, it it'll be the sort of thing like the, the sort of broad
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:09.120]  foundational platform where there is no one answer, meaning in the same way with the phone,
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:13.280]  like so many people use their phones in such different ways. I mean, but my wife
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:18.880]  hardly uses the camera. She, she just has never been a photographer. She knows I take family
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.760]  pictures. She just doesn't take a lot of pictures. Like if you look at her camera roll of pictures
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.720]  she'd taken, it's, it's mostly like products like things she wants to buy or something like that.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:34.800]  She just doesn't take photos. Other people specifically only upgrade their phones just
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.440]  to get the new camera and hardly use the other features. Right. I could see the headset being
[01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:43.600]  that I, if it's successful where some people are going to buy it and it's going to be for,
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.880]  for work that they'll put it on and use it as like virtual displays for their Mac or doing stuff.
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.600]  So they can have like the equivalent of a desktop display while they're traveling without carrying
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:57.920]  one around and they'll never play games. They have no interest in it. Other people will buy it just
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:02.800]  for the games and watching movies on airplanes or something like that. And obviously the broader
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.280]  mix of people will be a little bit of everything, but I could, you know, if it's a really that
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:15.600]  foundational, like the Mac and like iOS as a platform, it'll be for work, for information,
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:21.360]  for entertainment. Yes. Not, not like one of those things, but yes to all of them, because it's a
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:26.960]  foundational platform and a general purpose computing system that you could do anything
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:35.680]  that you can imagine. So I guess this is, if that's true, if all of the platforms have
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.480]  basically their Venn diagrams intersect a lot and they've all got unique capabilities,
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:45.520]  like currently I can use a pencil, Apple pencil on the iPad. That's great. iPad's great for a
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:50.560]  lot of bunch of stuff. Macs are good for a bunch of stuff. The watches obviously very specific
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:55.920]  AirPods, very specific, the phone very broad, but still really quite specific in that like,
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.520]  you're not going to do a spreadsheet on your phone. And maybe this new device is also like that.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.480]  I feel I'm harping on this a bit, but is that not
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:13.920]  more of a broadening of computing into not quite ambient, but like, however you want to access
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:19.840]  your stuff, you can do it, which is an old son. So I was like Scott McNealy, I believe his name
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.080]  was like a, you just log into any computer, you get your user account, you do your stuff. Like
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:28.720]  if I can touch any computer and it could do anything that I needed to do in any, maybe
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:33.920]  there's better form factors to doing a certain thing better. Like, do I want to draw with my
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:40.560]  mouse? Probably not. iPad's good for that. Is that not just sort of broadening computing to
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:45.760]  being like whatever the surface is that you're interacting with will offer you benefits by its
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:55.680]  physicality, but not necessarily in and of itself. Like, I guess when you buy an iPad,
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.600]  are you buying the iPad or the ability to interact with your software in a new and interesting way?
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.160]  It's a very philosophical, I was about to say, I'm wrapping up here and you're getting,
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.000]  you're getting into Philly. I do think you're right though. And I guess,
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.600]  I guess the other thing that's interesting about the headset as a new platform for Apple is it's,
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.240]  it, and I'm not discounting, we just talked about, I think AirPods are the first mainstream AR
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:29.040]  product. I think they're more important and more interesting as computers, not as headphones,
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:34.320]  but as computers than most people give them credit for. The watch, I don't underestimate at all,
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:39.360]  but again, ambient, right? It's, most of what the watch does isn't you interacting with it.
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.360]  Most of what the watch does, it's just doing on its own on your wrist when you're not even looking
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.040]  at it, keeping track of all your vitals and your health statistics and stuff like that.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.640]  You have to go back to the iPad for a thing that you're actually looking at that has a display
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.880]  that's going to have a new set of APIs for developers to write software against.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:03.840]  It's the first one though, the iPad came out in 2010, which was early days for the,
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:11.840]  for iCloud and stuff like that. This is the one that's debuting when the Apple broader ecosystem
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:18.400]  is established. And I was going to say millions, but I think by Apple's count, it's like billion
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:26.320]  active users are, have their data and information and their digital lives in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:32.240]  I think that's a big part of it, of the ambient part of it. And I know people are not going to
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:38.160]  walk around with this first headset as it's being rumored, that ski goggle thing. They're not going
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:44.080]  to be out on the sidewalk driving their cars or wearing it all day long. It's not like glasses,
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:50.000]  it's not AR glasses. But I really do see, obviously, that's an end point for where
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.400]  technology is going. And in the same way we talked about Mac OS X launching with an advanced window
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:03.680]  manager years before it was ready, getting the AR segment of this off the ground with
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:11.280]  crude hardware by AR standards, right? Like 10 years from now, when the glasses that show
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.960]  ambient heads up displays for everything in your field of vision are commonplace, we'll look back
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:26.560]  at headset 1.0 as being almost comical in AR because of how it, but it is what it is. And to
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.440]  get the software ecosystem to get people... I think it's comical in retrospect, like if we
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.240]  just, we have praise upon marathon, if you played it now, you'd be totally disappointed.
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:40.320]  Right. I was just watching a video of it and I was like, Ooh, that's actually really janky.
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:46.480]  Right. And the original Macintosh was really slow and everything in hindsight is slow. The
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:49.760]  first iPhone. That's okay. That's the nature of introducing something new. It's always the worst.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:54.000]  It's always the worst one, but you've got to start somewhere. So anyway, I'm excited.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.640]  And again, I said this to Jason and I could say it to you, I'm excited. I'll see you next week.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.320]  I know I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah. It's been a long time. Well,
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.760]  December. So not too long. I could do with a couple of months off from you, to be honest.
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.840]  Well, hopefully we didn't jinx the Mac Pro like we did 10 years ago.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.720]  I think he can't jinx it. Hey, Hey, I loved it.
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:22.560]  That's why I never got invited back to the life show is like, yeah, I got it.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.680]  I got it. We got a guy.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:32.560]  Anyway, I will see you literally see you next week. I will see everyone out there listening.
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:38.000]  I will see like a thousand of you next week in the California theater. I look forward to that.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.680]  You get your tickets. If you don't have one now, go just go to during fireball.net slash the talk
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.560]  show. The ticket stuff is at the top there. I look forward to that. So I'll see lots of people.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:53.600]  I will thank our three sponsors today. They were let's see if I can do it off the top of my head.
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:58.320]  We had rocket money where you can personal finance and find all the subscriptions.
[01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.720]  You might want to cancel Squarespace, build your own website and collide fleet device management,
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:08.160]  get your fleet into a hundred percent compliance, whatever that means.
