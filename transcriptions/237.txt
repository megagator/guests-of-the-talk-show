[00:00.000 --> 00:05.280]  This is episode 237, which is actually, to me, a very special number,
[00:07.360 --> 00:12.560]  because of course that's the room in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining where bad stuff happens.
[00:12.560 --> 00:16.240]  I'm curious, have you seen Ready Player One? Maybe you even, you're the one who told me I
[00:16.240 --> 00:21.120]  should go see Ready Player One. I guarantee you I didn't tell you. You should go see it. But yes,
[00:21.120 --> 00:28.720]  I've seen it. And so here's a bit of a spoiler. I don't, is it a spoiler? I don't know. At this
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.840]  point, I feel like the movie's been out on home video for a while. So I will say that in Ready
[00:33.840 --> 00:41.600]  Player One, there is an homage to The Shining. And I had no idea. I went into the Ready Player One
[00:42.320 --> 00:45.440]  knowing almost nothing about it. My son and I went to see it in the theaters.
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.840]  I am, of course, a huge Spielberg fan.
[00:49.840 --> 01:00.160]  It sounded like a good movie. It's like virtual reality, apocalyptic future, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.080]  I was like, all right, that's it. I don't need to know anymore. And I went into this movie Blind.
[01:05.040 --> 01:15.360]  And when The Shining sequence came on, I swear to you, I wept. I actually had tears streaming
[01:15.360 --> 01:25.120]  down my face. Like I actual tears. It was so amazing. I absolutely cannot believe how good it
[01:25.120 --> 01:33.760]  was. We know what they say, john representation matters. I don't know about the movie overall.
[01:37.280 --> 01:40.400]  I think that's the general consensus. People found things to like,
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.000]  right. But then they the immediate caveat is I don't know about the movie overall. I guess
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.200]  I would still recommend the movie overall, because it is it held my interest.
[01:54.480 --> 02:00.640]  Let's put it this way. Like it's, it did, I think the best it could do with the source material.
[02:00.640 --> 02:07.280]  Yeah, which was not very, I mean, you know, I don't know, I'm not really in, I don't live in
[02:07.280 --> 02:15.760]  fear of angering. Ready Player One fans, you know, it's not something I quake about. But that said,
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.480]  I probably will anger some people, but I just think the book is, it's terrible. You know,
[02:20.480 --> 02:27.920]  and I think the author is certainly has had a vision and certainly has a lot of clever ideas
[02:27.920 --> 02:33.680]  and things like that. But the book itself is very poorly written. I believe it's very amateurish,
[02:33.680 --> 02:40.640]  and it's prose. And it totally took me out of the story. And then a lot of the concepts in the story
[02:40.640 --> 02:48.640]  are very, I don't know, either basic or not very well thought out or don't take into account like,
[02:48.640 --> 02:53.120]  you know, simple logic and things like that. And you can totally set all those things aside and
[02:53.120 --> 02:58.480]  go, you know, I just loved it was a rollicking good time and all that stuff. And I get it,
[02:58.480 --> 03:03.840]  I get it. I'm not telling anybody else, they shouldn't like it. Just for me, it wasn't so great.
[03:03.840 --> 03:08.880]  And so the watching the movie, I was very, very concerned. I'm like, I might even be able to make
[03:08.880 --> 03:13.520]  it through this thing. And I actually didn't watch it for a long time, and then saved it for a plane
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.320]  ride, which is what you do. And I ended up watching it on the plane. And it was just fine. It really
[03:20.320 --> 03:24.880]  was just fine. Like I didn't, you know, it wasn't like I came away from that with any sense of like,
[03:24.880 --> 03:29.760]  Oh, I wasted my time. I was like, that was, you know, it's absolutely enjoyable. Great actors in
[03:29.760 --> 03:35.920]  it. Lena Waithe is in it, who's one of my favorite actresses. She's an amazing director as well.
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.440]  Directed a great series called Chicagoland. If you haven't seen it, it was also in Master of None,
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.480]  season two, or both seasons, but season two, she directed an episode that I think won an Emmy. And,
[03:48.480 --> 03:51.600]  you know, there's a lot of good things to love about that in Spielberg, right? Like,
[03:51.600 --> 03:55.600]  he knows how to handle those big things, and treat them with a sense of truth. So
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.680]  it came away feeling okay about the movie itself.
[03:59.280 --> 04:07.280]  It's, I'm glad that Spielberg is still so productive. And I mean, I would say bordering
[04:07.280 --> 04:14.160]  on prolific, right? I mean, in some ways, it's, it's the opposite of Kubrick, who, as you know,
[04:14.160 --> 04:21.120]  years went on, was almost spiraling into, like a logarithmic scale on how frequently movies came
[04:21.120 --> 04:29.600]  out. Right. But it's funny, because he's so gifted, he literally, you know, like,
[04:32.320 --> 04:39.200]  again, debate class or law school, you know, you're, you're always expected, you could argue,
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.200]  you have to be ready to argue either side, right? You know, like, you can't just say,
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.920]  Well, I think this guy is guilty. So I would like to prosecute him, you know, you share,
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.800]  you might have to defend them. Yeah, what's your argument for the defense? And in that way,
[04:52.800 --> 04:58.880]  it's like, if you were in like a debate, and you were going to have to argue for somebody to be the
[04:58.880 --> 05:04.800]  best filmmaker ever, and you got dealt the card Steven Spielberg, I would, I may not be who I
[05:04.800 --> 05:09.200]  would have picked out of the deck, but I would be like, Oh, this, this, I can do this, right,
[05:09.200 --> 05:16.160]  I can make the argument that he's the best there ever was. Right. But what's weird about him, as
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.680]  arguably, you know, certainly one of the best, but it's like, he occasionally puts out some real
[05:21.680 --> 05:27.040]  clunkers, you know, like, ones that are like, I don't even see how anybody thought this was
[05:27.040 --> 05:32.000]  a good idea, right? Like Indiana Jones four, whatever that was called, you know, sure. Like,
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.760]  that was a bad movie, you know, the Crystal Skull, the Crystal Skull, like, that is,
[05:37.760 --> 05:42.560]  it is very, very difficult to believe that that was made by the same people who made
[05:42.560 --> 05:48.880]  the first movies in the series, right? Like, and that's one in particular, where I'm a particular
[05:48.880 --> 05:53.040]  humongous fan of Raiders of the Lost Ark. And I would even say that the other comes with a lot of
[05:53.040 --> 05:59.680]  baggage, right? Right mind, you know, and that, you know, I like Temple of Doom, and I like the
[06:01.040 --> 06:07.440]  last crusade. I thought they were good sequels. And, you know, but they weren't Raiders,
[06:07.440 --> 06:12.720]  there was something there was some ineffable, there's something about Raiders and the exact
[06:12.720 --> 06:18.160]  tone that it strikes that they never seem to have been able to recapture, you know, maybe
[06:18.160 --> 06:24.640]  can't be recaptured. It was just so perfect. I put the Crystal Skull one, it's like, how is this
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.360]  made by the same people? I cannot believe this, right? Right. Ready Player One is not in that
[06:29.360 --> 06:33.840]  territory. Ready Player One is is pretty good. But it's still you have to it's like you said
[06:33.840 --> 06:38.800]  about the source material. It's like, it's like, I'm not sure how before they even started
[06:38.800 --> 06:44.640]  production, how they thought this was going to be that good. Mm hmm. I don't know. Yeah, I mean,
[06:44.640 --> 06:50.640]  you know, the problems were very clear on their face walking into it, right? Like, you know,
[06:50.640 --> 06:55.680]  you looked at that, and you said, Okay, here are your issues. It's a jumble of pop culture stuff
[06:55.680 --> 07:04.640]  without any true like, gluing force, right? It's an enormous amount of exposition going on in it.
[07:04.640 --> 07:11.120]  That really has nothing to do with an ongoing story. Like it's it's just a lot of digression
[07:11.120 --> 07:16.400]  into his personal likes the author's personal likes, right? Like, oh, I loved this game from
[07:16.400 --> 07:21.280]  the 70s. So now I'm going to describe it to you in intimate detail, right? And I think one of my
[07:21.280 --> 07:26.480]  original issues with the book and the reason I read it twice, even though I hated it, is which I
[07:26.480 --> 07:33.600]  do sometimes because just to make sure, but I, I, I listened to the audio book, and Wil Wheaton
[07:33.600 --> 07:40.560]  read it. And I like Wil Wheaton quite a bit, but I find his audio narration to come off as quite
[07:40.560 --> 07:47.520]  smug. Like in it normally I don't mind. You know, I totally like the guy a lot. I like his writing
[07:47.520 --> 07:51.360]  and all of this. But when he was reading-
[07:51.360 --> 07:53.840]  Trenton Larkin His narration's a little too Wesley Crusher is what you're saying.
[07:53.840 --> 07:58.800]  Jay Haynes Yeah, basically. And the situation is that you had that source material, you know, with
[07:58.800 --> 08:03.760]  its particular proclivities to like condescension and like, oh, you didn't know about this game, but
[08:03.760 --> 08:08.640]  I'm going to explain it to you in detail and why it was so amazing and whatever, right? And then
[08:08.640 --> 08:15.360]  you pair it with his voice. I convinced myself that maybe I was just I had some sort of anaphylactic
[08:15.360 --> 08:23.360]  reaction, right? To the combination. So I went ahead and read it myself, you know, like in text
[08:23.360 --> 08:30.720]  form. And I was like, Oh, no, I was. It was bad. It's good. Did you sound like it?
[08:30.720 --> 08:39.360]  Trenton Larkin He did. He had in fact read the book beforehand. And we had a very, I thought very
[08:39.360 --> 08:45.360]  interesting conversation after the movie about it was, you know, to me, this is good parenting. It's
[08:45.360 --> 08:50.560]  like, we had a very, like an hour long conversation about movie versions of books. And of course,
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.840]  yeah, that, you know, there's, there's a lot of people who just have their take on it is the book
[08:55.840 --> 09:01.520]  is better than the movie. And that's their book is the North Star. And that's it. And it's like,
[09:01.520 --> 09:06.160]  that's not a good take. And we, you know, he's seen The Shining. I think he's even read the book
[09:06.160 --> 09:09.680]  on The Shining. And I was like, The Shining is, you know, maybe the canonical example where the
[09:09.680 --> 09:15.120]  book is excellent. And the movie is amazing. And they're totally different. And, you know,
[09:15.120 --> 09:19.840]  the author of the book had, because it was different, had bad feelings about the movie.
[09:19.840 --> 09:25.840]  And then he made his own version for television. And it was all Yeah, right. Do you ever see that?
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.720]  I actually, it's funny. I never did. I've only heard about it like apocryphally. I don't know
[09:30.720 --> 09:37.360]  what even made me watch it. Because like, for example, I've never seen the movie 2010. Because
[09:37.360 --> 09:47.920]  it to me is it's like, what's that word when you're breaking a religious law? Oh, well, not
[09:47.920 --> 09:56.240]  verboten. taboo or no. I know what you're talking about. But it's not coming to me. Yeah, not coming
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.120]  to me either. But that's what I feel like that, you know, you can't just make an unauthorized
[10:01.120 --> 10:05.520]  sequel to 2001. What the hell's wrong with you? So I won't, I won't even watch it. Well, not even
[10:05.520 --> 10:13.120]  look at it. Now was Isaac Isaac Asimov was not alive. Right? When the No, not Asimov. It was
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.680]  Arthur C. Clarke, as you're thinking of. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I apologize. Yeah. But was he
[10:17.680 --> 10:23.600]  alive at the time they made 2010? I can't remember. I don't know. He wrote the book.
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.560]  You know, he wrote, certainly, I read the book, and I'm almost positive. I did see the movie,
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.000]  but it's in the sort of in the hazy reaches of my movies watching past, you know, I don't I doubt I
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.960]  dwelled on it, which probably says a lot, you know, I know, I should I don't know why I'm
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.240]  irrational. I am I don't know if you've ever noticed this. I have never I have some hangups
[10:44.240 --> 10:49.840]  never crossed my mind. But for whatever reason, I decided I would watch the ABC miniseries The
[10:49.840 --> 10:53.600]  Shining. Okay, you know, Stephen King, it was I think it was called Stephen King's The Shining,
[10:53.600 --> 11:01.360]  just so you knew that this one was by the book. And it was, it was bad. It's just bad. It's just
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.920]  poorly made, poorly shot, poorly cast. Like anything that can be bad about it was bad.
[11:08.960 --> 11:14.720]  Well, it's like, you know, people use that phrase too close, right? You're too close to something
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.480]  to see it, right for what it is or to see the value in it. And, you know, I certainly believe
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.800]  that that even great authors or great playwrights or screen screenwriters can fall prey to that. And
[11:26.800 --> 11:31.440]  I think that's an example of that for sure. Yes, do you need a distant eye to look at it for you?
[11:31.440 --> 11:37.120]  Yeah. Anyway, Ready Player One's overlook thing made me weep. It was so good and so amazing and
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.720]  so loving. And it just so you know, just the right and it was just the right length, you know.
[11:42.720 --> 11:48.240]  Right. So it's, to me, there was lots of great stuff in there like that, I think,
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.440]  but it's just, you know, the overall was a little bit rough for me.
[11:54.400 --> 11:59.360]  But the other thing about Spielberg I want to before we go off it is he's also making
[11:59.360 --> 12:03.520]  still making some amazing, amazing movies. Have you seen Bridge of Spies?
[12:04.640 --> 12:10.800]  I haven't yet. And it's on my list. But yeah, it looks looks amazing. It's like this late stage
[12:10.800 --> 12:16.240]  collaboration with Tom Hanks and Spielberg is amazing. The post is really good to Bridge of
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.640]  Spies, though, in particular is one that I would hold up. So you know, anybody out there is looking
[12:20.640 --> 12:28.080]  for movies to watch over the holiday season. Bridge of Spies is so good. And it's, you know,
[12:28.080 --> 12:33.760]  it's like proof that he still got it. But it almost it's interesting to me that he wavers
[12:33.760 --> 12:40.640]  between like a, quote, small movie like Bridge of Spies, which isn't really effects laden. I mean,
[12:40.640 --> 12:46.240]  you know, the effects are that it, you know, takes place in the past. So I mean, there's obviously
[12:47.520 --> 12:54.240]  some sort of, you know, special effects trickery going on there, but it's not a blockbuster,
[12:54.240 --> 13:02.320]  you know, right. $500 million grossing movie, you know, it's, you know, it's a movie for adults,
[13:02.320 --> 13:08.480]  I guess. Yeah. I don't know. I do. I worry I it is interesting, because the other thing about
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.320]  like a movie like Ready Player One, which was clearly meant to be like a ginormous worldwide
[13:14.320 --> 13:22.080]  blockbuster is. And it was the explanation that I saw for why Crystal Skull was the way it was
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.600]  that when they make movies now that are supposed to be, you know, like one of the top grossing
[13:27.600 --> 13:33.760]  movies of the year. It's like, it's also arguably why the James Bond movies have gotten a little
[13:33.760 --> 13:40.160]  incoherent is that it's all about the spectacle. And the worldwide box office is so much bigger
[13:40.160 --> 13:46.880]  than the US box office, that the sense that a movie makes by listening to the dialogue and
[13:46.880 --> 13:51.840]  what they say isn't even that big a consideration anymore. Because the idea, you know, most of the
[13:51.840 --> 13:57.040]  people who are going to be buying tickets to see it are not even gonna care. Yeah, that it's all
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.360]  either dubbed or subtitled or something. Right. It's just the spectacle of it.
[14:01.360 --> 14:04.960]  Jay Haynes Yeah, I mean, I think that that, you know, that concern has been around for a long
[14:04.960 --> 14:09.680]  time since the blockbuster. Well, Star Wars really birthed the blockbuster, right. But since that
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.720]  time, I think that film, you know, people interested in film who've written about it or
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.240]  talked about it, that's been a major concern. But I think it's, we've gotten to the point where we
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.800]  had all the arguments, and now everybody just assumes it's true. And nobody bothers to really
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.800]  push back against it and go like, Oh, no, you know, it's a thinking man's blockbuster, or
[14:28.800 --> 14:33.280]  whatever. And we've gotten to the point where we sort of, you know, you have all the arguments,
[14:33.280 --> 14:37.920]  but the generation that had the arguments is now past and the generation that has grown up with
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.960]  that in their face is now here, and they don't care, you know, and it's, it's an interesting
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.280]  one. But they're there every once in a while, you will still see these big movies that managed to
[14:49.280 --> 14:54.320]  have just a great combination, of course, of director, screenwriter, you know, team,
[14:54.320 --> 15:01.120]  etc. You can almost never credit one person. But that do it right. And like, Mission Impossible was
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.400]  quite excellent in that regard. Because it certainly was a blockbuster. But the last,
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.440]  I think three have been attached, you know, because they used to be pretty standalone,
[15:11.440 --> 15:15.680]  right? Yeah. But the last three of them have sort of been attached to one another. Did you see the
[15:15.680 --> 15:18.720]  latest one? I did. I did. Yeah. What would you think? What do you think?
[15:18.720 --> 15:27.200]  Ah, good enough. You know, I'm not disappointed. I, you know, it is effectively I've been thinking
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.880]  about it. I thought about before I even hit play on it. I think I just watched it last weekend.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.240]  Definitely recently. You know, it seems very obvious, but I also seem to be personally 15
[15:38.240 --> 15:43.840]  years late to the realization that the Mission Impossible and Ethan Hunt are America's James
[15:43.840 --> 15:51.920]  Bond, James Bond, right, right. It's, you know, yeah. Yeah, I like the series a lot. It's, you
[15:51.920 --> 16:00.240]  know, it's, you know, as a bond fan, I feel like you, how could you not? It is interesting to me
[16:00.240 --> 16:05.760]  that it's an interesting film series to me, because they try not to, there's a formula,
[16:05.760 --> 16:11.520]  obviously, but they try not to remake it. And that they've done, you know, even just by starting with
[16:11.520 --> 16:18.160]  by having the first one helmed by Brian De Palma, you know, who's sort of the
[16:20.160 --> 16:25.040]  what was it noir, right? It was an action movie, or noir disguised as an action movie,
[16:25.040 --> 16:31.680]  which he's sort of the failed Spielberg. I that sounds wrong, because I'm a huge De Palma fan,
[16:31.680 --> 16:38.640]  you know, but, but at a certain point in the 70s, he was shoulder to shoulder with Steven Spielberg,
[16:38.640 --> 16:46.640]  you know, and, and was sort of the, you know, and Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, you know,
[16:47.200 --> 16:55.120]  and Scorsese, that there were all these guys, who were, you know, and they were all came of age in
[16:55.120 --> 17:00.160]  the 70s, and made these amazing movies, and they all sort of had their personal styles, you know,
[17:00.160 --> 17:05.120]  like, De Palma's camera movement, you know, De Palma was moving the camera around before
[17:05.120 --> 17:11.040]  steady cam was even invented. I don't even know how, you know. So it was fascinating that the
[17:11.040 --> 17:17.600]  first one was De Palma. And it's I love the first one is truly a magnificent movie. But then they
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.560]  had what John Woo directed the second one or the third one? Yeah, the second one. The second one
[17:22.560 --> 17:32.000]  was John Woo's. I mean, he had made other stuff before in the US. He made Broken Arrow, I think.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.520]  Yeah, but it was supposed to be his big entry into the US market. And it certainly was very John
[17:37.520 --> 17:42.400]  Woo. I mean, yeah, you can't say that that movie wasn't a John Woo movie, even had the slow motion
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.480]  dogs. I mean, it was Oh, yeah, he had the doves, but it wasn't the right choice. And it was
[17:46.480 --> 17:52.320]  certainly, you know, what the most incoherent, ironically, I think some of the most like weird
[17:52.320 --> 17:58.560]  and awkward and, and good and in that way, villain performances, Doug Ray Scott is the villain in
[17:58.560 --> 18:08.080]  that. And it's, he's just so sneery and malevolent, you know. But it was it had some good things about
[18:08.080 --> 18:11.920]  it. And a lot of the good things were basically Tandy Newton and Doug Ray Scott, you know.
[18:13.040 --> 18:19.920]  But it was a, it was a misstep. But then the third one recovered big time, you know, and it just
[18:19.920 --> 18:25.840]  just has gone on to be, I think, a really, really great example of the action or blockbuster genre
[18:25.840 --> 18:33.360]  that manages to, to miss out on the, you know, oh, this is a horror show. And, you know, is not
[18:33.360 --> 18:37.840]  worth your intellectual interest, you know, kind of thing that's been happening with these movies.
[18:37.840 --> 18:41.120]  Yeah, I mean, which have you have you seen? I'm sorry, I digress.
[18:41.120 --> 18:46.320]  Well, I, before we get off Mission Impossible, I like the series a lot. And I liked the last one.
[18:46.320 --> 18:52.240]  It's, it's good. It's probably it's not my favorite. I don't know. Maybe because there was
[18:52.240 --> 18:59.440]  a little too. There wasn't like a there there. I don't know. Okay. I'd give it at least a B plus,
[18:59.440 --> 19:04.720]  certainly worth watching. And it was it was a little long. Like, I, I'm not quite sure why
[19:04.720 --> 19:10.240]  it was over two hours long. But yeah, I think I think that's a disease all movies are suffering
[19:10.240 --> 19:14.160]  from, you know, the editors are getting less and less power. And the directors are getting more
[19:14.160 --> 19:20.560]  and more power. And, you know, the analogs of the corporate world are strong, you know,
[19:20.560 --> 19:25.280]  when you get a CEO, and there's nobody there to tell them, no, you end up with, you know,
[19:25.280 --> 19:30.160]  problems. And the directors, the CEO of that production, and you need an editor to be like,
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.400]  Nah, you know, who else has direct? I mean, with the list of directors of the Mission Impossible
[19:34.400 --> 19:40.800]  movies is so great. Brad Bird directed the one. That's right. JJ Abrams, directed was that the
[19:40.800 --> 19:48.640]  third one that I think he directed to DJ Abrams. Yeah, but really great directors in it. You know,
[19:48.640 --> 19:53.680]  I don't know. It's a great series. And I think it's a real testimony to Tom Cruise. I mean,
[19:53.680 --> 19:59.600]  however weird he is in his personal life. He's really, really racked up a hell of a film
[20:00.640 --> 20:06.640]  catalog. Yeah, so the yet john john Woo was the the second one of the JJ Abrams sort of resurrected
[20:06.640 --> 20:11.840]  it, you know, with Mission Impossible three. And remember, it was, it was only four years between
[20:11.840 --> 20:16.640]  the first two and then six years to the second one of the third one. Because I think everybody was
[20:16.640 --> 20:21.760]  like, Oh, God, that's over. Right. Right. And but then JJ Abrams kind of resurrected and then Brad
[20:21.760 --> 20:28.960]  Bird, which was one of the best entries in the in the whole series and then Rogue Nation and Fallout
[20:28.960 --> 20:34.400]  are both Christopher McQuarrie. That's right. That's right. Which is Yes. Both of them, I think
[20:34.400 --> 20:39.760]  are excellent. Yeah. Now it's a good series. I really liked it. Yeah. I mean, in the way that
[20:39.760 --> 20:43.760]  that the Bond films sort of ebbed and flowed with the quality of the director, you know,
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.360]  sometimes you would get a director and in the 70s, who who went on to be to be great, but at the time
[20:49.360 --> 20:53.200]  was just sort of doing whatever. And then sometimes you got directors who were on the wane,
[20:53.200 --> 20:57.920]  right? And like the the we're friends of the broccolis or something they got, they got a
[20:57.920 --> 21:03.040]  directing job. And you sort of saw the difference. But what I was gonna say about the blockbuster big
[21:03.040 --> 21:08.640]  movie thing in I'm not going to talk about the movie at all, because it's opening today. You
[21:08.640 --> 21:14.000]  know, I won't talk about plots, but particulars, but into the spider verse Spider-Man animated
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.840]  film. Yeah, I've heard about this. Yeah, I highly I mean, I don't know, you know, I don't know when
[21:17.840 --> 21:22.400]  this will air. But if if you haven't seen it by now, if you didn't go see it an opening weekend,
[21:22.400 --> 21:28.000]  go go see it immediately. It's amazing. And not only is it one of the best Spider-Man movies,
[21:28.000 --> 21:34.480]  if not the best Spider-Man movie ever made. It is just an incredible animated film with a ton of
[21:34.480 --> 21:41.760]  heart, really, you know, conscious of the world we live in, really entertaining and heartwarming.
[21:42.400 --> 21:47.680]  And it is sort of does that it pulls this magic trick in that it, it does that thing where a
[21:47.680 --> 21:53.200]  movie deconstructs the genre that it's in, you know, even you've seen this with some other
[21:53.200 --> 21:58.080]  movies where, you know, it's a very self referential in terms of like, it knows it's an
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.160]  action movie. So it's gonna play with the tropes. Let's, let's say true lies or something like that,
[22:02.160 --> 22:08.480]  right? Where, you know, this this action movie is just it's so over the top, because it knows it's
[22:08.480 --> 22:13.680]  supposed to be and it also comments on it, you know, whatever. But it does that for comic book
[22:13.680 --> 22:23.280]  movies and comics in a way that's that is also very respectful, right of the of the genre. It
[22:23.280 --> 22:28.800]  does not make fun of it. It makes you feel like these are fans of this, you know, genre that made
[22:28.800 --> 22:33.760]  it. And they want you to have the best experience possible. And it's really good. I highly recommend
[22:33.760 --> 22:40.640]  it. Yeah, it looks good. It just also seems well cast. I know, I don't know much about it. I again,
[22:41.520 --> 22:45.760]  it's a lot like Ready Player One, I kind of got the gist. I get it multiverse. There's multiple
[22:45.760 --> 22:51.040]  Spidermans and sharing kind of dimensional thing, right? People are shooting through different
[22:51.040 --> 22:55.920]  dimensions. And you get a whole bunch of different universes where there's always a Spiderman. All
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.320]  right, cool. Yeah, I'm sold, which is a concept that was established in the comics, you know,
[23:00.320 --> 23:05.360]  so the comics already have established the framework for that. But none of the movies
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.400]  have ever touched on that. But the only other thing I know about it is that at least one of
[23:10.400 --> 23:17.760]  them, I believe he's a Peter Parker is played by john Malaney, who's a stand up comedian who
[23:17.760 --> 23:21.840]  Yeah, john Malaney plays and this is not a spoiler because it's in the credits of, you know,
[23:21.840 --> 23:27.840]  IMDb, etc. But he plays Peter Parker, which is in it's in the trailer. So I'm fine mentioning it.
[23:27.840 --> 23:34.080]  But Peter Parker. Yeah, I wouldn't call that like a Mad magazine. Yeah. Pig version, comic book
[23:34.080 --> 23:42.960]  version of Spiderman spider pair. Right? Exactly. And it's, it's amazing. I mean, the how that's
[23:42.960 --> 23:47.360]  handled in the movie is incredible. You would think that something like that would take you
[23:47.360 --> 23:51.840]  completely out of it and kill any dramatic momentum the movie had. But they somehow
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.320]  managed to sidestep it entirely. john Malaney is a national treasure, in my opinion, big fans here
[23:58.320 --> 24:03.920]  in the Gruber household. We've gone to see him all three of us. He's, he's truly, truly and a
[24:03.920 --> 24:08.640]  terrific stand up comedian. And I can totally see how his voice would be perfect. Like,
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.400]  he could make a living in doing animated movies. You know, he's got a voice.
[24:12.400 --> 24:18.480]  Jared Polin Yeah, absolutely. But the cast overall is really good. Haley Steinfeld is in it.
[24:18.480 --> 24:26.480]  Jake Johnson is in it, who's many people probably know from the that Zoey Deschanel series. I don't
[24:26.480 --> 24:32.720]  know, I never watched it. But he's a great actor. I like him. But the lead the Miles Morales, who's
[24:32.720 --> 24:40.720]  the kind of lead spider man, spider, spider young person is played by this guy named Shamik Moore.
[24:40.720 --> 24:46.880]  And Shamik Moore is not known to a lot of people, although I think this will certainly get him a big
[24:46.880 --> 24:52.160]  exposure. But he was in this movie called dope, which was very under seen and incredibly funny.
[24:52.720 --> 24:59.440]  I really, really liked it. But it was super talented actor and definitely held his weight
[24:59.440 --> 25:04.160]  with other characters. And there are other people in it that are, yes, they're in the credits, but I
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.640]  don't want to mention them. Because when they when they pop up, people will be like, holy crap, you
[25:08.640 --> 25:16.160]  know? But it's sort of like Ready Player One that way. Yeah, exactly. Like, I mean, the uncle voice,
[25:16.160 --> 25:24.240]  which is fine. The uncle voice, which I'll mention, is played by Mahershala Ali. So it's,
[25:25.040 --> 25:30.800]  you know, there, there's amazing, an amazing cast of this Lily Tomlin plays Aunt May, you know, so
[25:30.800 --> 25:37.680]  it's, it's great. It's, they got us really solid. What's the story on how this movie even came to
[25:37.680 --> 25:47.600]  be? Because it's like, for as rich as Disney is, the the Marvel film universe is still like the,
[25:48.560 --> 25:55.760]  it is like this, the worst. It's fragmented. Yeah. Right. It's the victim of really poor
[25:56.560 --> 26:03.040]  decisions made by a flailing Marvel, you know, in the 90s or late 80s. Right. When Marvel was
[26:03.040 --> 26:11.120]  flailing, they sold like the X-Men to Fox, and Spider-Man, Spider-Man, Sony, and it was exciting
[26:11.120 --> 26:17.600]  because Sam Raimi was going to make it. And I'll tell you the truth. I've never been a big Sam
[26:17.600 --> 26:24.400]  Raimi fan. And, okay, the Spider-Man movies he made our exhibit, they can't be friends.
[26:24.400 --> 26:33.120]  Well, I, you know, it's, what is it that you don't like about him? Is it the, is it the,
[26:33.120 --> 26:38.320]  the humor or is it, it's what he thinks is funny and I don't. Okay. Yeah, I got it. And I figure,
[26:39.680 --> 26:46.000]  and I don't know, like, to me, the way that he made the Spider-Man movies, and maybe that's
[26:46.000 --> 26:51.440]  the way they had to be made. I don't know. But it's, it's almost like there's a, there's always
[26:51.440 --> 26:59.840]  been like a video game-ness to his visuals that I don't like, you know, and, and I dunno, I enjoyed
[26:59.840 --> 27:05.280]  them. I've watched all the Spider-Man movies, I think. But why, what a twisted saga. And,
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.680]  and now they've, you know, they've somehow got Spider-Man in the regular Marvel universe through
[27:11.680 --> 27:16.640]  some kind of finagling, but what's the deal? Like they had like an exception for animated movies.
[27:16.640 --> 27:25.760]  Is that, is that what happened legally? No, it's, the studio is, it's Columbia and Sony and Marvel
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.760]  co-production, right? So it is still a Sony thing because they do own the licenses even for animated
[27:31.760 --> 27:38.480]  stuff. But Marvel and Sony have this sort of deal, this cross-licensing deal now where Marvel
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.320]  basically gets to use the character, but Sony is still making like Venom and like other Spider-Verse
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.600]  characters stuff. But it's very, it is very complicated. I heard that was terrible. Somebody,
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.320]  I read like a review of the Venom movie and they were like, this, this movie doesn't even make any
[27:54.320 --> 27:59.600]  sense. Yeah, I haven't seen it. And it's unfortunate too, because Venom is such a great character,
[27:59.600 --> 28:06.320]  but I'll be honest, I never really had any sort of faith in Venom as a character that was not
[28:07.040 --> 28:12.560]  an immediate foil for Spider-Man. I mean, the whole reason Venom was invented was to explore
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.840]  the darker side of, you know, what, what Peter Parker could be or was. And it came out of the
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.880]  whole Secret Wars thing, which is a whole nother story, but I really do believe that it's like
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.720]  Spider-Man without Venom is pointless as hell, you know, in my opinion, but.
[28:27.920 --> 28:33.920]  Yeah. I was reading comic books back in the Secret Wars era. Wasn't that, was that, was that,
[28:34.640 --> 28:40.400]  am I misremembering that it was like, he got like, he got the black costume from outer space
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.960]  and yeah, well, it was when they were fighting. Yeah. It was, they're fighting in the secret wars
[28:44.960 --> 28:51.680]  off planet and he, his suit got damaged or whatever. And he found this, um, this suit
[28:51.680 --> 28:59.360]  that was just sort of, um, like ready-made or there and he came upon it and everybody's like,
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.960]  uh, maybe you shouldn't put that on, you know, like where did it come from? Um, but it was the
[29:04.960 --> 29:10.480]  symbiote. It was, it was a, it was an alien that gave him additional strength and power and
[29:10.480 --> 29:16.160]  eventually became, you know, obviously its own villain when attached to Eddie Brock. But yeah,
[29:16.160 --> 29:21.440]  that's where he acquired it off planet. Um, yeah. And, um, it was, it was very,
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.360]  it was a very interesting, it was, it was fun. It was a sort of precursor to infinity war.
[29:25.360 --> 29:30.640]  Yeah. Um, you know, in that, and it was, it was definitely a, an interesting kind of
[29:30.640 --> 29:37.280]  crossover, big event. I mean, Marvel was doing a lot of those in that era. Um, but then that
[29:37.280 --> 29:43.200]  I have, um, so one of my personal, I have a few personal comics that I really, I held on to,
[29:43.200 --> 29:47.280]  like I had an amazing fantasy 15 for a while, but ended up selling it. Um, that's the first
[29:47.280 --> 29:54.240]  appearance of Spider-Man. Um, and then I have, uh, but I have a web of Spider-Man number one,
[29:54.240 --> 29:59.200]  which is the web of Spider-Man number one is when he realizes that the suit is no good for him. And
[29:59.200 --> 30:04.400]  he has to get rid of it and he tries to get it off of himself. You know, that's that storyline.
[30:04.400 --> 30:08.400]  Yeah. And it's just like, I, that was just one of my treasured, you know, belongings growing up.
[30:08.400 --> 30:12.000]  And like, I had a lot of love for the venom character, so I haven't even seen the movie
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.880]  because I don't want to be sad. Right. You know, I just don't want to be sad. Um, but anyhow,
[30:18.880 --> 30:25.360]  I think it's, it, it's the, the animated one sidesteps a lot of the problems that could have
[30:25.360 --> 30:31.680]  cropped up. And I think the secret sauce there, which is no real secret is, um, Miller and Lord.
[30:32.320 --> 30:39.680]  So, um, I don't know if you know who Christopher Miller and Phil Lord are, but they did the,
[30:40.240 --> 30:46.080]  they started off, um, in like 2009, they made this movie called cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
[30:46.080 --> 30:51.520]  Sure. You ever seen it? Uh, well, I know the book and I think we watched the movie too. Yes.
[30:51.520 --> 30:56.800]  Yes. We did watch the movie. It was when, uh, it was age appropriate for my son. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:56.800 --> 31:03.600]  Yeah. It's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. It's hilarious. It's funny and, and, and heartfelt and kind of
[31:03.600 --> 31:11.600]  zany, but in that grid way and, and totally proves why, um, what's his name, uh, from SNL, the, the
[31:11.600 --> 31:17.920]  lead actor in, in that, uh, bill hater. Yeah. Bill here. Well, he's such a great voice talent
[31:17.920 --> 31:22.240]  and he's in some Pixar stuff now because he's a big Pixar fan. But, um, anyhow, cloudy with
[31:22.240 --> 31:26.480]  the chance of meatballs was great. And they, they kind of cut their teeth on that and they ended up
[31:26.480 --> 31:33.120]  playing that into directing 21 jump street. And then, which, um, have you ever seen that? Yeah,
[31:33.120 --> 31:39.440]  I think so. I think that 21 jump street was, I don't know why I don't remember. Yeah. Jonah
[31:39.440 --> 31:42.880]  Hill. And I mean, it's not like you need to remember anything about the movie. It was very
[31:42.880 --> 31:46.080]  funny, you know, but it's one of those things. It's like, okay, that was hilarious, but it's not,
[31:46.080 --> 31:52.000]  you know, it'd be on your rewatch list. Um, but, uh, yeah, Jonah Hill was in that, uh, and that
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.320]  was a project that he tried to get off the ground. It was sort of his Genesis, but, uh, Miller and
[31:56.320 --> 32:02.560]  Lord directed that and it was a big hit, very surprise hit because everybody was like an R
[32:02.560 --> 32:12.720]  rated comedy starring Jonah Hill and, um, uh, what, uh, um, who was the other, Oh, Channing Tatum,
[32:12.720 --> 32:20.480]  you know, and, and I'll based off of 21, what, you know, 21 jump street and, but it was a huge hit
[32:20.480 --> 32:25.920]  surprise hit. So that sort of like gave them a platform to stand on. Um, and then they,
[32:25.920 --> 32:32.320]  they made, um, 22 jump street as well, but they made their biggest bang with the Lego movie.
[32:32.960 --> 32:36.640]  So they're behind the Lego movie. And so when you look at that, you go like, okay,
[32:36.640 --> 32:43.120]  animate animation expertise, um, great sense of humor. They honor material. I mean, the Lego movie
[32:43.120 --> 32:46.640]  when, you know, you first saw that was coming out, you're like, Oh God, what cash-in job is this
[32:46.640 --> 32:52.560]  going to be? Right. And it was hilarious. And somehow managed to like honor the origins of all
[32:52.560 --> 32:59.040]  those superhero characters, as well as the concept and feeling of Lego and like the joy of creation
[32:59.040 --> 33:03.520]  and family and all of this stuff. And you're like, how the hell did this happen in a Lego
[33:03.520 --> 33:08.400]  movie? You know? So it just proved that they, they really had chops. And so when I heard the project
[33:08.400 --> 33:13.120]  was gonna, was going to fire up like an animated Spider-Man, I was like, Oh, you know, another one,
[33:13.120 --> 33:16.880]  cause they've all been crap. All the animated Spider-Mans have been pretty terrible. Um,
[33:17.840 --> 33:22.160]  but it was produced by Amy Pascal and I'm like, well, she's not, you know, she's not a dummy.
[33:22.160 --> 33:27.920]  Um, and then, um, they got attached, uh, filler and lore got attached and I was like, Oh, hell
[33:27.920 --> 33:33.200]  yeah. Like I'm in like, whatever they do, I think they'll do it right. And they managed to chart the
[33:33.200 --> 33:38.880]  course between Sony and Marvel and all of that to be, to use the extended universe and the characters
[33:38.880 --> 33:43.200]  and to do it right. And it was good. It was really, really good. Yeah. Cause the other thing,
[33:43.200 --> 33:49.760]  when I, when you hear animated superhero movie, you think about those awful, awful DC ones that
[33:49.760 --> 33:54.640]  they keep turning out, you know, like I don't watch them, but I can't help but watch the
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.200]  previews. Like I see a new one show up in iTunes and I'm like, well, let me, let me see how bad
[33:59.200 --> 34:05.360]  this one looks. And they're like, how much of an asshole can Superman be? And they're, they're,
[34:05.360 --> 34:10.560]  they're made using that, like whatever the, do you want to call the style? It's like,
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.800]  but it's like the dower filter, but it's like even like a low frame rate, you know what I mean?
[34:16.800 --> 34:22.080]  They're like only animated at like 12 frames per second. It's everything. Oh, you're talking about
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.120]  the animated ones. Like the animated DC movies. I was talking about the cinematic universe ones,
[34:27.120 --> 34:31.520]  but sure. No, the animated ones too. No, the animated ones are so bad. I know what you mean.
[34:32.160 --> 34:35.840]  There have been a couple of good ones to be honest. Like there's a couple of the justice
[34:35.840 --> 34:39.920]  league ones that are decent. Oh, come on. Cause they had people involved. They're the right
[34:39.920 --> 34:44.080]  people involved. I swear to God. But for the most part, they're not good. Yeah, you're right.
[34:44.080 --> 34:48.240]  They're not good. I actually watched it. I couldn't help it. I actually watched, I watched
[34:48.240 --> 34:55.120]  the, uh, the dark night. Uh, the one that's based on like the most beloved graphic novel of all time.
[34:55.120 --> 35:03.760]  Right. That's not good. The one that I did like was the one based on, and I can't, I mean,
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.720]  there have been so many, I can't even begin to think that I would call it out of my, out of the
[35:08.720 --> 35:16.320]  ether, but there was one that was based on this storyline where the golden age heroes had to link
[35:16.320 --> 35:22.320]  up with the, with the silver age heroes, um, and kind of defeat this cosmic threat of some sort.
[35:22.320 --> 35:30.320]  So it was like Barry Allen and, um, uh, classic flash. What's his name? Um, or new flash. So it
[35:30.320 --> 35:34.480]  was basically like new flash, old flash had to team up kind of thing. That was really good. Like,
[35:34.480 --> 35:38.960]  and so there have been some gems in there, but I agree that the animation itself,
[35:38.960 --> 35:44.720]  like production value has never been good, which is actually a great contrast to
[35:45.360 --> 35:50.880]  into the spider verse, which is, has a style that is absolutely unlike any movie I've ever seen
[35:50.880 --> 35:57.920]  animated or otherwise it lives incredibly unique. Um, Sony, there was like this new story, which,
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.320]  you know, people got kind of wrong, uh, to be honest. And the animators on the project are
[36:02.320 --> 36:06.560]  actually kind of mad about it, but there's a story that Sony was like saying, Hey, we're,
[36:06.560 --> 36:12.000]  we were going to patent the system that we used to create this movie. And everybody took it to
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.480]  mean that they were trying to patent it. So nobody can make anything like it, you know, but in
[36:16.480 --> 36:20.880]  reality, they're patenting the tools that they made, which Pixar does. Right. I mean, they just
[36:20.880 --> 36:26.800]  picks are just open source, their tools, some of their big tools this, uh, like a year or two ago.
[36:26.800 --> 36:32.480]  And, um, you know, open sourcing a tool is a big deal for a studio like Pixar who relies on,
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.760]  I mean, tools, a huge part of their value prop and their workflow, you know, what they do,
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.800]  how they create movies. And so anyhow, the, the Sony is saying like, Hey, this thing that we use
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.680]  to create this is so unique. We want to productize it so other people can use it. Um, but there,
[36:47.680 --> 36:54.480]  the animation style is one of the best I've ever seen. It sort of manages to translate the feel
[36:55.040 --> 37:01.360]  of like half tone and comic and, you know, hard-edged line, you know, line drawn look,
[37:01.360 --> 37:08.960]  um, with a, a really clever use of art style to. Telegraph to the audience, what universe each
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.800]  Spider-Man is from. Right. So like they're, they're all animated. I mean, and there's no way I would
[37:12.800 --> 37:17.120]  have thought they'd be able to, to sort of include all these different styles and animate all of
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.920]  these characters differently to, to kind of Telegraph where they came from and for it to
[37:21.920 --> 37:25.680]  still mesh somehow. And they did it, they pulled it off. It's really good. No, I'm looking forward
[37:25.680 --> 37:33.600]  to it. Um, yeah, that's a bit of a digression. I love movies though. We do digress. I think
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.760]  it's just our ammo. All right. Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor. It is,
[37:39.760 --> 37:47.440]  uh, Jamf J A M F. This episode is brought to you by Jamf. Now look, it's easy to keep track of your
[37:47.440 --> 37:53.760]  own Mac, iPad, iPhone, but what about the other Apple devices at your work as a business grows?
[37:53.760 --> 37:58.720]  So does its digital inventory and it gets harder to manage everyone's Apple devices.
[37:58.720 --> 38:05.520]  Uh, and it's especially true if employees are remote and in a lot of new companies,
[38:05.520 --> 38:11.600]  everybody's remote, right? I mean, that's the new way that people make companies. Uh, Jamf now

[39:49.360 --> 39:54.080]  I think we're done. I think we've done enough on movies. Maybe we need an editor.
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.400]  It is funny though. I, you know, we touched on a lot of, a lot of ones I've been sort of vaguely
[39:58.400 --> 40:03.440]  thinking I should talk about. Like I've been kind of wanting to make the point of just saluting the
[40:03.440 --> 40:08.480]  mission impossible series. Like, like I think it's, you know, I mean, it's not like they're
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.720]  quiet, you know, they're obviously big budget movies. They're always well promoted and they
[40:12.720 --> 40:20.240]  seemingly all do well, but I kind of feel like the, the series as a whole is sort of doesn't
[40:20.240 --> 40:26.000]  get the recognition it should. I think it's, it's, it is extremely rare to make what, seven movies
[40:26.000 --> 40:32.880]  and have them all be good. Yeah. I mean, anytime you make more than, more than the allotted three,
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.960]  you know, that people think should ever be, then you start to get into this thing. It's like,
[40:36.960 --> 40:41.520]  Oh, is it a cash grab? And is it going downhill? And I think it does deserve credit for continuing
[40:41.520 --> 40:49.520]  to evolve. You know, kind of become a little bit more, not self-referential, but self-aware,
[40:49.520 --> 40:54.480]  you know, to some degree. And it's, it's clever. It's keeps coming up. They keep coming up with
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.560]  nice, nice new ideas. And I think certainly you can't, you can't talk about mission impossible
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.120]  at all. Not, not to spend another 30 minutes on movies, but you can't talk about it without
[41:05.120 --> 41:08.800]  talking about, you know, Tom Cruise and his commitment to those things. And you can have
[41:08.800 --> 41:13.360]  problems with him personally or whatever. And I totally understand, but his commitment to those
[41:13.360 --> 41:20.720]  movies, to making those things feel real and the stunts and, and, and his desire to make them as
[41:20.720 --> 41:28.080]  good as possible. All backed by, of course, his very unique star power and power in the industry,
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.960]  et cetera. And you can't, you can't imagine those movies getting made or being good without him,
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.880]  you know? Yeah. He's sort of an ageless wonder. I mean, it's, it's, you know, my, my wife watched
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.680]  the movie with me and she thinks he's got, uh, some, I think she said filler. I don't know what
[41:43.680 --> 41:48.400]  that is. It's some kind of thing. They stick in the face or something, but, you know, but he
[41:48.400 --> 41:52.800]  certainly doesn't, doesn't look like artificial. It doesn't look like he's had weird cosmetic
[41:52.800 --> 41:58.000]  surgery. He just looks like he's in tremendous shape. And, you know, uh, it's kind of remarkable,
[41:58.000 --> 42:03.920]  really. It's like, he's still making action movies and he's totally credible at it. It's,
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.040]  it's very, very credible. Yeah. It's, it's actually pretty wild. Did you see the thing?
[42:09.040 --> 42:16.240]  Um, he's, I guess they're making a new top gun movie. Uh, yeah. And oh no, we can, we can spend
[42:16.240 --> 42:21.280]  about 40 minutes talking about this that he made. I don't even know. I don't know who he did it
[42:21.280 --> 42:26.080]  with. I don't, I, I, I should know. I don't, I could look it up for the show notes, but he,
[42:26.080 --> 42:31.600]  he made a video recently and put it out, uh, from the set of top gun and he's in costume,
[42:32.160 --> 42:37.680]  I guess, as maverick. Uh, like, I don't, it just seems so weird. Like,
[42:37.680 --> 42:41.040]  I don't know how they're going to make this movie. Like how can, how can there are no
[42:41.040 --> 42:46.400]  57 year old fire pilots and he kind of has to be 57 because he made the first one in the eighties.
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.080]  Right. Like, but anyway, but the movie isn't about the, the promotional video isn't about,
[42:52.080 --> 42:58.800]  uh, top gun. He's just there in, in costume, but he's there to talk about motion smoothing
[42:58.800 --> 43:04.640]  and it's remark. Have you seen this? Yeah, I have. Absolutely. I know, you know,
[43:04.640 --> 43:12.160]  I know, you know what motion smoothing PSA. Um, right. Which was, uh, uh, it was, it was the,
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.080]  the guy with him, by the way, it was Christopher Macquarie. Oh, that was Christopher Macquarie.
[43:16.080 --> 43:22.560]  Is he doing the top gun? I believe so. Don't quote me, but I believe so. Yeah,
[43:22.560 --> 43:28.000]  that would make sense. But yeah, exactly. And they did record it at, uh, straight to the camera PSA
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.480]  and instructing people on how to remove motion smoothing, which the film was hilarious.
[43:32.480 --> 43:38.960]  I will put this in the show notes. I've got this here. Um, but it's so great and it is,
[43:38.960 --> 43:44.480]  and it didn't, I'm, I'm misremembering the details of this, where they even said like, hey,
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.240]  when you go home for the holidays, like, yeah, take your, take your, take your parents' TV and
[43:50.240 --> 43:53.920]  turn off motion smoothing. Like, I don't know. I don't know if I remember the reference of the
[43:53.920 --> 44:00.800]  parents, but I think all of us do that. Right. Like it's as a service for our parents. And like,
[44:00.800 --> 44:04.720]  sometimes without them even knowing, cause just, we're so mad that they have to watch movies like
[44:04.720 --> 44:09.920]  this, you know? Right. It was, they did reference it. They did use the colloquial to reference it,
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.840]  which I think a lot of us have over the years, which is the soap opera filter.
[44:13.840 --> 44:22.640]  Yeah. Right. Right. It is, it is one of the strangest aspects of like the fact that that
[44:22.640 --> 44:30.640]  video has to exist is extraordinary and it's fascinating. Um, and I was talking, I was on,
[44:30.640 --> 44:34.320]  I think on a Slack group or something with some friends and we were talking about this video and
[44:35.040 --> 44:39.600]  I do think that part of it is simply that Tom cruise loves movies, right? Like it,
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.240]  it, he doesn't need, you know, he's obviously doesn't need to work, you know, I mean,
[44:44.240 --> 44:49.440]  well presumably, I mean, unless he's, you know, squandered himself some hell. Yeah. Right. You
[44:49.440 --> 44:54.000]  would think that financially he's, you know, he doesn't need to work and you know, but instead he,
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.200]  he's constantly working, he's, you know, making movies, you know, not, you know, much again,
[44:59.200 --> 45:05.520]  like Spielberg prolific. Um, right. I, but I think he loves movies, you know, and I think that that's
[45:05.520 --> 45:11.760]  what comes out in that motion smoothing video is they, they put all this effort into making movies
[45:11.760 --> 45:16.240]  look good. And then people watch them on TVs that out of the box make it look like garbage.
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.800]  And that's what, isn't that the strangest thing in the world? Like we live in a world where TVs are
[45:23.760 --> 45:27.760]  beautiful there and they're huge and they're getting bigger and bigger is definitely better,
[45:27.760 --> 45:32.720]  right? People have, you know, you can buy like 67 inch TVs and, and they're reasonably priced
[45:32.720 --> 45:40.960]  and they have great color or they're capable of great color. And out of the box, they all
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.720]  have this terrible, terrible thing turned on. And like, why, why is that?
[45:45.600 --> 45:53.520]  I, how did you know, there probably have been much better, like, you know, treatises written on this
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.080]  by, by people who have studied it. And I'm sure I've probably read someone somewhere, but the
[45:58.080 --> 46:06.160]  basics of it are that live sports look better with mostly sports still drives cable, you know,
[46:06.160 --> 46:11.680]  and TV. But I mean, I, that's, that's the basics of it as far as I understand it. And, you know,
[46:11.680 --> 46:16.240]  maybe, maybe I'm wrong, but yeah, cause that is certainly is bewildering to anybody who loves
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.640]  movies because it's makes movies look fricking terrible. And that is, that is the one thing in
[46:20.640 --> 46:26.720]  that PSA that I sort of disagree with is that they, they endorse going into relatives homes
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.240]  and turning it off only for when you're watching movies. But that's a hard, I think that's hard to
[46:32.240 --> 46:37.920]  do, right? Like, yeah, I mean, I guess you could do it if they have like an Apple TV or if they
[46:37.920 --> 46:45.600]  have like an Amazon fire stick or box or something, you know, anyone or Roku rock, you, how do you
[46:45.600 --> 46:54.160]  pronounce it? Roku, Roku, Roku. I always get it wrong. And now I, I second guess myself. But if
[46:54.160 --> 47:00.560]  you have, you know, any of these set top boxes, you know, you can presume that you're using them
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.320]  mostly to watch movies and movie like TV shows. But I don't even know if that's safe to assume
[47:06.320 --> 47:10.960]  anymore though, because so many people who are cutting their cable, they watch, they might be
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.840]  watching their live sports through those boxes now too. All right. So how do you tell your TV
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.120]  to turn off motion smoothing only if it's a movie like you can do it by the input, but
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.600]  you can't really assume that everything from these things is a movie anymore. So I just say turn it
[47:25.600 --> 47:31.680]  to hell off for everything. You don't need it. It's it's a Yeah, I don't. I love sports. I like
[47:31.680 --> 47:37.760]  to watch sports. I don't think motion smoothing makes sports look better. No, I mean, it doesn't
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.680]  right. I mean, I'm not in my mind. But it certainly is the look that people have become more
[47:41.680 --> 47:47.200]  used to, you know, that high frame rate look in basics interpolation as additional frames, right?
[47:47.200 --> 47:53.440]  Right. To make it look look smoother, which is dumb, because it creates images that weren't
[47:53.440 --> 47:58.160]  there, you know, in effect. I think Ryan Johnson called it liquid diarrhea at one point.
[47:59.040 --> 48:04.720]  Johnson, that was one of the other things that I would that that PSA was like, I would like to see
[48:04.720 --> 48:11.680]  the Ryan Johnson version of it, because it would be R rated. Right. Right. Johnson's hatred of
[48:11.680 --> 48:15.840]  motion smoothing makes it look like makes me feel like maybe I'm okay with motion smoothing.
[48:15.840 --> 48:22.480]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think like all these guys are in on it, like James Gunn
[48:22.480 --> 48:28.080]  and Edgar Wright and and Chris McCrory and all these guys. But yeah, it's it's certainly
[48:29.520 --> 48:38.480]  terrible, you know? Yeah, it's just makes the the bottom the lowest common denominator on this is
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.560]  like, does it look good in the store? Right. And I think a lot of it has to do with that. And the
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.160]  fact that they play like sports and highlight reels and stuff in the store to get people to buy
[48:46.160 --> 48:51.840]  big TVs and watch live sports. And the thing is, like, live sports is the thing that's keeping
[48:51.840 --> 48:58.320]  cable alive. Like it's the it's huge, you know what I mean? And for for people that want, you
[48:58.320 --> 49:02.160]  know, to be able to get those games and to bounce around between games and all that stuff, because
[49:02.160 --> 49:06.960]  the streaming services, unless you subscribe to something very specific, and the MLB is very
[49:06.960 --> 49:12.720]  unique in this, like the MLB app, you know, you can't just get every game you want, you know,
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.640]  it's not the way it works. And even with the MLB app, as you know, you know, if you want to watch
[49:16.640 --> 49:23.280]  a game that's on locally, you know, local team, you often have to resort to your your local
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.240]  broadcaster. Yeah. So yeah, I've been that. Yeah, for those who don't know, it's if you're outside
[49:30.240 --> 49:37.200]  the US, this is I think this is going to sound crazy. But like, I pay, I pay like 100 bucks a year to subscribe
[49:37.200 --> 49:43.200]  to the MLB app at bat, and I'm happy to do it. It is maybe it's more than 100 bucks. I don't know,
[49:43.200 --> 49:48.320]  like 120 or something. I don't know. But the Yankees play 162 regular season games a year.
[49:48.320 --> 49:57.600]  I watch, I'll bet I watch at least 100 of them. Maybe more. But because I don't live in New York's
[49:57.600 --> 50:04.160]  TV area, I can do that I can just fire up any device, my Apple TV, and I my phone, my iPad,
[50:04.160 --> 50:10.080]  whatever. And because I subscribe, I can watch. But you can't watch your local team that way. So
[50:10.080 --> 50:16.480]  like, I couldn't watch the Philadelphia Phillies. Or if I happen to be in New York, I can't watch
[50:16.480 --> 50:24.560]  the Yankees on the app. Because they have these TV deals. And it's, you know, we could probably
[50:24.560 --> 50:30.080]  draconian, it really is like a mafia situation, right? Well, and in Philly, in particular, because
[50:30.080 --> 50:37.760]  the Philadelphia's, you know, Comcast is headquartered in Philadelphia, the two tallest
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.560]  buildings in city are both Comcast towers, they don't just have one giant tower, they have to,
[50:43.120 --> 50:50.240]  they they they quite literally own the city. And they have the TV rights to the Phillies. Like,
[50:50.240 --> 50:56.480]  how is that? How is that legal? It's like the cable company actually owned the TV right. So
[50:56.480 --> 51:01.760]  you have the only way to watch the Phillies is on Comcast Sports Network. Oh, my God, like,
[51:01.760 --> 51:07.440]  it's not even that it's it's some, you know, like the Yankees have the yes network that the Yankees
[51:07.440 --> 51:12.320]  themselves own. And they actually had a fight like two years ago, where they weren't on Comcast,
[51:12.320 --> 51:16.640]  because they were arguing over how much you know, they had like a financial disagreement. And so
[51:16.640 --> 51:21.280]  at least, I think it was like two years ago, two or three years ago, the Yankees played most of the
[51:21.280 --> 51:25.600]  season, and you couldn't even watch them on TV. People in New York couldn't even watch the Yankees
[51:25.600 --> 51:31.600]  period. And even though they weren't on cable, because they had to spat with Comcast, you still
[51:31.600 --> 51:37.040]  couldn't watch them in the app. Because it was a local blackout. Right? Very, very. Yeah.
[51:37.840 --> 51:44.800]  Yeah. And in the, you know, consumers, there's this, you know, once again, this is another huge
[51:44.800 --> 51:50.400]  discussion we could go on, but consumers always get screwed in this. And the the cable companies
[51:50.400 --> 51:57.360]  and the the distribution companies fight all the time, right? Like the fight about the content
[51:57.360 --> 52:02.560]  that goes on at the sports situation is is one element of this, you know, they fight for the
[52:02.560 --> 52:07.680]  deals, and they, they cut local deals, and they cut national deals, etc, etc. But like, there,
[52:07.680 --> 52:12.000]  there are other deals too, with like content producers like Disney, for instance, Disney
[52:12.000 --> 52:17.360]  always fights with Comcast. They fight with Comcast, like off and on all the time. And so
[52:17.360 --> 52:24.000]  like, sometimes you'll be on your Comcast, and you just won't get ABC, or whatever, they'll threaten
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.520]  to like remove CBS or whatever, you know, they fight with each other all the time. And so the
[52:29.520 --> 52:34.800]  only person that loses the consumer, and what usually results is some even more draconian deal,
[52:34.800 --> 52:39.040]  you know, that locks you out of even more choice. It's really bad, which is why everybody loves
[52:39.040 --> 52:44.880]  cord cutting. It's just not there yet. Yeah, I've noticed, because we go to Walt Disney World every
[52:44.880 --> 52:50.960]  year. And we're, it's funny, I don't know, if you're like this, but it's, we as a family,
[52:50.960 --> 52:56.480]  we don't, we're not anti TV, we watch, you know, plenty of TV at home. But whenever we travel,
[52:56.480 --> 53:02.320]  we almost never even turn the TV on in a hotel room. Yeah, because we're, wherever we are,
[53:02.320 --> 53:10.000]  whether it's Disney or anywhere else, we're in this outside our home traveling to do something,
[53:10.000 --> 53:15.200]  right. And that something is not watching TV. So like, no, we've even commented, like, there's a
[53:15.200 --> 53:18.720]  lot of times where we don't even know, you know, like the TV couldn't even be plugged into the
[53:18.720 --> 53:23.120]  wall. And we wouldn't know because we just never turn it on. But every once in a while, I will be
[53:23.120 --> 53:26.880]  there. And maybe it's like a Sunday in Dallas Cowboys are on or something I want to watch
[53:26.880 --> 53:32.240]  sports. And it's very funny, like, when you're at Disney World, they have a very strange selection
[53:32.240 --> 53:41.840]  of channels available. Like, they definitely have, they have the owns. Yeah, it's, it is like,
[53:43.760 --> 53:47.040]  it's very strange. It is. It's like you're in the Disney universe.
[53:48.400 --> 53:52.000]  Like, they have like, you've got Disney Junior and Disney Channel for sure. And like,
[53:52.000 --> 54:00.720]  everything else is like a question mark at 18, like 18 different ESPN. Yeah, ESPN Ocho.
[54:00.720 --> 54:05.200]  Yeah. So there's, it's like, you're, you're, if the sport you want to watch is on ESPN,
[54:05.200 --> 54:08.240]  you're in luck. And if it's not, you might be out of luck.
[54:10.480 --> 54:20.720]  Yeah. I think they're the TV, like the division, you know, deal scenario, whatever you want to
[54:20.720 --> 54:26.240]  call it is one of those things that everybody wants to try and break up, which is why everybody's
[54:26.240 --> 54:31.520]  like trying to like come up with these streaming packages and OTA packages, including Apple,
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.800]  you know, and everybody else. And it's one of the big major things everybody wants to take down,
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.200]  you know, they want it to go away. And nobody's really figured out a way to do it though, because
[54:41.200 --> 54:46.480]  the claws are in super deep. And it's difficult to get them to give up because you're essentially
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.840]  telling them to give up like an essential monopoly and all the money in the world for some other
[54:51.840 --> 55:00.320]  nebulous ideal. And that's just very difficult to do. So do you have cable? I do. And to be honest,
[55:00.320 --> 55:08.240]  I only have it because my wife watches Bravo. We definitely still have it. And my wife watches
[55:08.240 --> 55:17.040]  a bunch of shows that I guess we could get through cord cutting. But, you know, it's, you know,
[55:17.040 --> 55:22.480]  just, it's just, we, we have it. I think we're, you know, the bills on auto pay. I'm sure it's
[55:22.480 --> 55:29.120]  a ridiculous amount. But I don't see it. I call, I call them and, and, and threaten to cancel and
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.800]  get a lower rate every like six to eight months. Can you do that for me? Yeah, I know. It seems
[55:34.800 --> 55:41.520]  disingenuous, but at the same time, I don't know. Would I cancel? Sure. If there was another viable
[55:41.520 --> 55:46.400]  option, absolutely. And so I figure it's the monopoly tax. You know what I mean? If they're
[55:46.400 --> 55:50.640]  going to be a monopoly, they're going to have to deal with me calling them once in a while
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.240]  to get a lower rate, which they do. Like you, all you got to do is call them and they're like,
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.480]  Oh yeah, here's this promo deal. If you'll stick around. And I'm like, great. Why didn't you just
[55:58.480 --> 56:02.560]  give me the promo deal? You know what I mean? I mean, I'm a loyal customer. Why don't you just
[56:02.560 --> 56:09.520]  give me that? I've literally been a Comcast customer for over a decade, easily. And that,
[56:09.520 --> 56:18.400]  that is just, they have no, they have no desire to be friendly to loyal customers because there's no
[56:18.400 --> 56:23.360]  other choice in many areas. And that's the big thing. I mean, obviously that ties into
[56:23.360 --> 56:28.480]  neutrality and a bunch of other things, but it's just sad that they've gotten common,
[56:28.480 --> 56:34.560]  they've gotten complacent and lazy about trying to please anybody or treat them well because you
[56:34.560 --> 56:38.880]  have no other options. Like somebody punches you in the face and you're tied to a chair. What are
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.280]  you going to do? You know? Well, I think one of the things for us too, though, is that we have a
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.200]  TiVo. We've had a TiVo for, Oh my God, that's probably like close to 20 years now. I mean,
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.760]  we don't have a, we're not using a 20 year old TiVo box. I forget how many we've had,
[56:53.760 --> 57:02.640]  but not too many. And I, I know, I think Syracuse still uses one too. And I know that I tell people
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.920]  this and they're like, TiVo is still a thing. And it's like, yeah, but it is the best. It is the
[57:07.920 --> 57:15.040]  best play pause experience and fast forwarding of anything I've ever seen. Like it, I don't
[57:15.040 --> 57:19.440]  understand how this isn't a solved problem, you know? And I know that when Apple came out with
[57:19.440 --> 57:26.320]  like the, the current generation of Apple TV you know, that they, they emphasize to us, you know,
[57:26.320 --> 57:31.840]  that they spent tons of time, you know, getting their, the stuff for streaming video to,
[57:31.840 --> 57:37.440]  to be able to fast forward and, you know, go back and forth better. Cause it's always been a
[57:37.440 --> 57:43.040]  problem. You know, sometimes it works and then sometimes you get a spinner and it doesn't work,
[57:43.040 --> 57:49.680]  it doesn't work. Right. It's, it's, it's confounding with TiVo. It is, it has no latency
[57:49.680 --> 57:55.520]  at all. And it never has like it going back to like when I first got one in like 1999, like
[57:56.320 --> 58:03.440]  it, it, it, it, it's the only onscreen thing that, that perfectly works for fast forwarding.
[58:03.440 --> 58:09.680]  Everything else is always a little frustrating and they have, they've been having it and,
[58:09.680 --> 58:16.640]  and it continues to get better. They've actually added the thing that the, who was the rival to
[58:16.640 --> 58:25.600]  TiVo back in the day? Oh, good question. They had an arch rival. They did. And they are,
[58:25.600 --> 58:30.880]  the arch rival had a 30 second skip button and TiVo never did TiVo never, you know,
[58:30.880 --> 58:38.160]  they had fast forward, but they didn't have like a 32nd button. But what they've done in about a
[58:38.160 --> 58:45.360]  year ago, they added this new feature. They have a four button 31 second skip button. No, it's,
[58:45.360 --> 58:51.200]  it's you just, they, I'm not even sure how the backend of this works and it doesn't work for
[58:51.200 --> 58:55.680]  every show is cause it's not magical. The, but the, you know, there's some kind of human
[58:56.560 --> 59:03.600]  interaction on TiVo's end, but TiVo knows what shows you have. Like it's not just like a VCR,
[59:03.600 --> 59:08.880]  you know, where it's just a random video feed, you know, like it knows that you were watching
[59:10.080 --> 59:16.480]  Full Frontal with Samantha Bee. And it knows that this is episode season three, episode 27
[59:16.480 --> 59:21.600]  or something. And they, for some shows and the more popular the show, the more likely it is
[59:21.600 --> 59:27.920]  about a year or so ago, they started adding codes for the, like, they know where the commercials are
[59:27.920 --> 59:32.480]  and you can just, it just tells you hit the D button and skip all the commercials.
[59:32.480 --> 59:37.920]  And so you just have one button, you just hit D and you just instantly jump to the exact right
[59:37.920 --> 59:43.280]  second you want to be at after the commercial break. Like not, it's not, it, it, you know,
[59:43.280 --> 59:49.040]  it's uncannily perfect. It's a great, it's really a great experience, but
[59:50.640 --> 59:54.640]  it's funny cause I mentioned this Samantha Bee show cause there was an episode that we missed
[59:54.640 --> 59:58.240]  and our TiVo for whatever reason didn't have it, even though we have a subscription to it.
[59:58.240 --> 01:00:07.040]  And so I, I, I downloaded the TBS app to the Apple TV. This is, I think literally last night.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.600]  And I had to download the TBS app. I had to authenticate through Comcast or Xfinity,
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.960]  whatever you want to call it, you know, which, and it all worked it's, you know, but it made me mad
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.520]  cause I have the single sign on thing on my Apple TV. It shouldn't, I shouldn't need to do that
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.360]  anymore. But then, you know, I could, I could watch any episode of Samantha Bee show I wanted to,
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.960]  but there were two commercial breaks and each commercial break had six commercials and you
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:44.000]  can't skip them. Like he literally just got to sit there and watch these. And it's like the rant,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.680]  I've said this, I think I mentioned it on the show, like the thing that TiVo makes,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.640]  it, it, it's the opposite of a, you know, that type of box. But like when we first computerized
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:02.000]  watching TV first started using computers as the, put a real computer between the TV, you know, the,
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.400]  the signal coming in from the cable to your TV, put a computer in between it. We did it so we
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.160]  can skip commercials. And now more and more we're using the, we're watching, we're watching stuff
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.880]  through a computer more than ever. Some people, everything they watch, you know, it goes through
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:26.320]  a computer and we're using the computer to make the ads unskippable. Like it's so wrong at a
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.560]  fundamental level. That is totally wrong. Yeah, exactly. And that, that goes kinds of experiences
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.280]  are what I mean by kind of like spitting in people's face, you know, because you know,
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.320]  that's mandated by the cable providers, right? Like Apple doesn't want that. And CBS or the,
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:46.880]  you know, no app maker wants to stream you that, but the companies themselves are beholden to those
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.480]  advertisers and just all the way down. It makes the customer experience extremely poor and that
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.360]  Comcast sign on thing. I don't know if iOS 12, it started working and forgive my ignorance on this.
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:03.600]  Somebody may know, I don't know, but you know, Comcast always didn't work cause they hadn't
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.120]  arranged, you know, they hadn't worked out the deal with them yet. And I don't know if it started
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:13.040]  working yet or not. I noticed an interesting behavior on my, cause I was set up an iPad for my
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:21.120]  son. All right. I kind of used a normal one and set it up for him and was installing everything
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.120]  brand new. And once I had lined in, logged into my iCloud account I was able to kind of like log
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.920]  in like Disney junior for instance, and authenticate with Comcast without having to
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.280]  enter my Comcast password. Whereas previously it would do this fake thing where it looked
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.000]  like you could do it. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about, but like you could click
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.960]  on Comcast and, and it would say, Oh yeah, we know your provider. Is it Comcast? You know,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:51.600]  and you'd think, Oh great. I, all I gotta do is tap this and I'm home free. And then it would
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.920]  still force you to log in because it's not real. You know, it's not like actually doing it. It's
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.040]  just offering it in the list so that, you know, they know, you know, or whatever. But now it like
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.320]  seamlessly logs in and I can't, I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's iCloud wide or what,
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.800]  but that's the way it should work. You know, one tap and then effectively it should just
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.560]  automatically find your account and just use it. You know, like the tapping part of it is,
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.400]  is the part I think they need to get rid of next. But that for a long time, you know, the Comcast
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.360]  experience, every time you had to log in, I don't think any executive at Comcast ever really
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.960]  understood this, but every time you had to log in, it was effectively like spitting in your face.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.280]  You know, it was like we, you know, you know, you're having to log in right now specifically
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.240]  because we, we are being punks and don't want to agree, you know, um, and being protectionist
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:50.240]  about this and you're the one who's going to suffer. So anyhow, it sucks.
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:04:00.080]  I, I've, I, I think I've mostly as a defense mechanism, I've, I've largely forgotten the
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.160]  experience, but when we moved two years ago, I know I've talked about this on the show,
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.080]  but it was probably like two years ago, but to get the TiVo working, you have to have these things
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.400]  called cable cards that are like, they're literally cards and they go in the back of the TiVo and
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.480]  it's, you know, you need one for each, however many inputs you have. And I think, I think we
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.120]  have like four now. I don't know how I've blacked out, you know, but in other words, our TiVo can
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:32.560]  record like four shows at the same time. Um, and they make it very, very difficult. And we were,
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.080]  we almost, I almost gave up. I was actually like on the cusp of just cancel it all, cancel the cable.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.120]  I'm going to sign up for this PlayStation view thing, which seems like the best,
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:50.720]  you know, the best equivalent to cable TV for a cord cutter at the time. And then I got like,
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.920]  somehow, and I, I didn't, I don't know how it happened, but I got escalated to like the secret
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:02.560]  agent team at Comcast and like the guy showed up and he was like totally aces, you know, he knew
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:09.120]  everything. Um, do you ever see the movie Brazil? It's one of my favorite movies. He was the Robert
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:16.000]  De Niro, you know, so the Robert De Niro B slash six. Yeah. Yeah. So the Robert De Niro guy showed
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.480]  up and literally in five minutes everything was working and in every other, you know, like the
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.720]  three, four times that somebody else had come was always 90, 90 minutes. They'd never heard of a
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.680]  TiVo. They have no idea. And then they're on the phone for an hour talking to somebody at, you
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:41.280]  know, somewhere and they're reading off all of these like crazy 20 character strings, you know,
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:47.920]  that the diagnostic mode brings up just, uh, and this guy showed up five minutes later,
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.040]  everything's working and he's like, bloop, bloop, bloop. And he's like showing me like,
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.320]  here, here's the end, you know, like, cause that's the other thing too, is usually like when
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.240]  somebody shows up like that, they just want to leave and you're like, well, hold on a second.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.560]  Let me see if this works before you leave. Right. He showed me, he was like, here, look,
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:09.040]  here's proof that it works. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah. I love, I love a good tech. Like I'm,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:15.120]  I'm a huge fan of like a competent tech working at a place, you know, either a contractor working
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.360]  for them or working directly for them who shows up and is like, oh yeah, here's what's, here's
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:24.160]  what's wrong and fixes the problem. And like, I've had this experience in my old house. We had,
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.720]  you know, it was built in the fifties, so the wiring was whatever it was. Um, and you know,
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.600]  time after time after time, I was, yeah, exactly bad. And time after time after time,
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.960]  we were just having trouble with it, pulling new lines, trying to figure all this stuff out.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.920]  And like the, I had people come out like three, four times from Comcast. And then some guy came
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:46.160]  out, he was like, oh, it's this, you know, he goes, guarantee you, I got to go up on that pole.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.480]  I got to replace this filter at the source. It'll be, it'll be fixed in like 15 minutes.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.440]  He climbs up there, he fixes it. Boom, done. And I'm like, you know what?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.320]  Can I just like permanently request you? Right. Right. You know, I love that. I love a competent
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:06.800]  tech. Oh, Comcast. All right there. Let me take a break and thank our next sponsor.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.920]  Linode. Linode is where you go to host a website. You can instantly deploy and manage
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.360]  an SSD server in the Linode cloud. And you can get your server running in seconds,
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:25.200]  literally like 30 seconds. You can actually get your own server up and running with your choice
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.600]  of Linux distribution resources and node location. They have 10 data centers
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.080]  worldwide. You can pick one that's close to you, get the, get the absolute lowest ping.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.320]  You can host somewhere else. If you're most of your customers maybe are in the West coast,
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.280]  you can get a server, you know, get your server on the West coast, whatever you need.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:52.720]  Their plans are unbelievable for just five bucks a month. You can get a plan with a full
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:58.480]  gigabyte of memory for a lot of sites. That's all you need. Like their starting plan for $5 a month
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.760]  is actually really, really good and could host an awful lot of pretty popular websites.
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:12.560]  Uh, if you need more though, they have high memory plans that start at 16 gigabytes. That's 16 gigs
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:19.840]  of Ram. You can start at a seven day money back guarantee. So sign up, start paying for some
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.000]  reason you're unhappy up to a week. You can just get all your money back, but you know,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.480]  you might only be out five bucks because you may only need the $5 plan. Unbelievable.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:36.400]  Um, they have hourly billing and a monthly cap on all plans, so you won't be surprised. Uh,
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.920]  and they have all the add on services that you could possibly want backups,
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:49.920]  node balancers, stuff like that. 24 seven friendly support, uh, native SSD storage across the board,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:56.960]  40 gigabit network, Intel E five processors. Uh, it's just unbelievable what they have. They,
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.080]  they're, the company is growing so big. It's, it's crazy. So they've got block storage. Here's
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:08.800]  the locations that they have. They have Newark, Fremont, Dallas, Atlanta, Frankfurt, London,
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.240]  and Singapore. And they are soon, maybe it's even out now. I'm not sure, but it's soon. They're
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:21.600]  going to have one in Tokyo. Uh, they have a restful API that is out of beta so you can write
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.560]  your own code to talk to your server, everything you need. It's, it's really great. Uh,
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:36.560]  and they're hiring, so you can go to www dot line node.com slash careers and take a look.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.360]  If you're, you know, a networking nerd, that type of person looking for a job, go check them out.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.080]  And they have a special deal just for listeners of the show. You get a $20 credit when you visit
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:55.360]  line node.com slash the talk show and use that promo code. Well, actually the PR that's the URL
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:03.280]  line.com slash the talk show. The promo code is talk show 2018. No, the just talk show 2018 gets
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:09.600]  you $20 of credit. So on a $5 a month plan, you could get four months for free. That's really
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:15.120]  quite a deal. So my thanks to line node. Excellent, excellent hosting company. Uh, go check them out
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:22.720]  at line.com slash the talk show. I don't know what the explanation is. Uh,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:32.560]  Philly is sort of downtown. Philadelphia is for a big city. It is relatively small downtown
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:39.280]  and it's part of what I love about living here is the, it's, you can kind of know
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.960]  everything downtown. It's, it's all walkable. Uh, and you can get from point a to point B
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:52.960]  in a couple of minutes. Uh, it's really useful. Um, but for whatever reason, like the Apple store
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:11:00.160]  is at, uh, I think it's on the 1500 block of Walnut, maybe 1600 of Walnut. Um, so like 16th
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:08.000]  and Walmart here in Philadelphia is where the Apple store is. One block east is a corner
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:17.440]  where there's a big Verizon store, huge, uh, with a, with, I swear to you, a giant cheesecake factory
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:28.720]  on top of it. Caddy corner is a big AT&T store, uh, across the street from the AT&T store is a
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:34.080]  fairly big T-Mobile, but it, it's funny because the actual retail footprint of the stores sort
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:41.760]  of tells you the nature of these carriers. Right. Okay. Verizon's biggest AT&T is sort of a copy
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.920]  of the Verizon and T-Mobile is more like a, you know, could easily be like a sneaker store.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.360]  You know, it's, you know, it's, there's nothing wrong with it, you know, but it's not, it's not
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:12:01.440]  big and huge and, and, uh, gotcha. Yeah. But now there's also, and it's all, why are they all
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.000]  together? I don't know. I don't know if it has something to do with that. They want to be close
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.640]  to the Apple store. It is, you know, like, like in most cities, Apple, Apple's location would they
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:18.240]  chose, you know, like the, it's like the best retail area, you know, the highest end retail
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:25.280]  area in Philadelphia is on Walnut street. Um, uh, none of these stores were there years ago.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.400]  Maybe the T-Mobile one was, but the AT&T and Verizon ones are fairly new, you know, within
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.880]  the last couple of years, uh, after the Apple store has been there. Uh, and now though, here's
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:43.040]  the thing that made me think of this is now there's an Xfinity cell phone store, like, so you
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:50.720]  can get Comcast as your cell phone provider and, and they don't have their own, right? So it's an
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.360]  MVNO. It has to be, I don't know the details of it. It has to be an MVNO though. They don't have
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:02.560]  their own network and they're, they, and they do have, there's a fair, you know, because we're,
[01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:09.760]  we're cable town, we do have a fair number of, uh, Xfinity wifi hotspots, you know? So like,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.800]  if you are an Xfinity customer, you can get wifi in large parts of the city. Um, if you need it,
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:21.680]  I don't, you know, but you, you know, with their phone, you don't really want to count on wifi.
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.240]  You, you need a network. But the thing that occurred to me and it just, I just wanted to
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:32.880]  bring it up is who, who thinks, you know, like, like I can see switching carriers. Like I'm,
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.760]  I've been on Verizon for years. It's not great. But the last company I think on the world that
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:43.440]  I would want to do more business with is Xfinity, right? Because why are you going to be like,
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.240]  that is not the consumer brand I would think you would want to shoot for, you know, or you would
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:53.360]  put on the front, it's Verizon, by the way, it's powered by Verizon. So it's like an alternate
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.200]  consumer brand for Verizon. Totally. I could see that some people don't like Verizon, you know,
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.640]  some people are like, oh, you know, Verizon has negative connotation with them or whatever,
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:06.240]  but if you're going to pick one, if you're going to pick a brand to take the place of a brand that
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.040]  people already may, you know, not like for just because it's been in the public eye and maybe
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.760]  they've heard negative things, whatever, you know, good God, you know, are you, I mean, you
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:21.360]  think you could come up with something better. Right. And the problem is that because my cable,
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.920]  I know what they do with my cable bill, and it's that they just keep charging me more and more
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.800]  because they can because they are taking advantage of their monopoly status. So they've, you know,
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.240]  that's their right, you know, I could cancel the service if I want to, right, I choose to
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.400]  keep paying them. But I've, I've got decades of knowledge that they will, they will keep raising
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:50.480]  raising my cable bill, and that I have to do what you would you do, because you're more sensible
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.840]  than I am is call them up and renegotiate. Like, that's a bad relationship, right?
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.520]  Right. Like, I mean, when I call a renegotiate, most of the time, it's basically a very mild
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:09.360]  faint towards, hey, I should probably cancel this because it's expensive. And they immediately
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.760]  transfer you to a customer retention person who's like, hey, we've got this deal, we're offering new
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:20.560]  customers, and we're just going to give you that. And it's usually like $100 off my monthly bill or
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.880]  $80 off my monthly bill. And I'm like, well, you know, you could have just given me this
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:30.880]  because I'm a loyal customer, you know, but their their point of view is like a gym, they operate
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.800]  like a gym membership where if you don't cancel, they're not going to tell you to cancel, right?
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.400]  You know, they're not gonna call you up and be like, dude, seriously, you don't go, we should
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.120]  probably just pause your membership for now. You know what I mean? No gym ever does that. And
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.760]  that's the way they operate. And it's it stinks. It's not it doesn't make me feel good about that
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.720]  company doesn't mean we want it. Like if Xfinity opened a gym, I would not sign up for that gym.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.400]  Right. Right. Exactly. Because not only would they not would they not cancel your membership if you
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.200]  weren't going but they probably just increase the price every probably six to eight months and never
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:10.400]  tell you. Right. I wonder though, the other thing that it makes me wonder about is it in some ways,
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.280]  it's a bad look to me for them because it shows I don't know whether it's a bad look or a good
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:21.280]  look like it's is it good because they have their their they're realistically looking at the fact
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:28.000]  that you know, cable is in decline. And it's never you know, cable TV subscriptions are not coming
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:35.920]  back, right? Like it the trend is going in one way. And it is towards not having cable. So is
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.240]  it good that they're looking at things like cell phone service because they've got to
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.000]  move beyond cable? Or is it a bad look? Like, hey, we can do this stuff. We can do this other stuff
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.600]  too. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think it's a good look if you're doing it yourself. And it's
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.640]  a bad look if you're just marketing somebody else's product, in my opinion. And so I don't
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.320]  I don't even think they view it that way. I wish I would hope that they would just from a, you know,
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.480]  business perspective and think they have the acumen to figure that out. But I actually probably
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:14.320]  think they think of it as a retention model, so that they can retain people, you know, they're
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.880]  saying, hey, if you get it in house, you don't have to worry about going to another cable provider,
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:23.040]  we've got all of your stuff here, right? It's more along the lines of that protectionist,
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.360]  right? versus innovative. And that's, that's the way I think that a lot of that stuff happens.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:38.240]  Yeah. Which brings me to maybe it's something that's actually on topic for the show is this
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:46.240]  ongoing series of reports that iPhone, iPhone XS, and especially the 10 are, it seems,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:53.280]  according to these reports that sales are bad, or disappointing that they are, I don't know,
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:02.000]  not good. And there's so much, it's, it's funny, because on the one hand, it's, it's, again, I
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.520]  don't know which side to come down on, on these stories, like, there's so much smoke that you feel
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:12.800]  like there's got to be some kind of fire. But on the other hand, it seems like every goddamn year,
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:19.760]  there's the same type of stories that so you know, some such and such supplier in in Taiwan,
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.360]  has said that a major company has drastically cut orders, and everybody knows that it's Apple. And
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:31.120]  so it must mean that something you know, that that they're not making anywhere near as many of the
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:38.240]  iPhone, whatever. And every year it these stories come out and every year, when Apple actually
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:45.920]  announces their quarterly stuff, it you know, it, it's nowhere near as drastic as it was, but like,
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.560]  the effect of this is seriously real, like, Apple has taken a huge hit. I mean, the stock market as
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:19:03.360]  a whole is, you know, a little shaky. But Apple's, you know, lost like $200 billion in market cap.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:08.560]  And, you know, this is not a financial podcast, I'm, you know, don't take investment advice for
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:16.880]  me. But I know that it matters. I one reason that it matters is that affects me, as somebody who's
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.120]  mostly interested in Apple's products is it's like a retention problem, because so many, you know,
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:28.400]  a lot of people at Apple, their Apple stock is, is, you know, a huge, huge reason they stay right.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.880]  And when Apple stock takes a hit, it's like, you can roll your eyes and say, I don't bounce back,
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.920]  because when the stories come out, but I don't know, when the company loses 20-25% of its market
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:46.000]  cap, that is a serious hit to to real people's personal, you know, wealth and investment.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.880]  I don't know what the hell's going on. I don't know what to make of it. Like,
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.640]  is this the same story as in previous years? And it's just people playing the game to
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:03.040]  manipulate the stock. And, you know, get clickbait, you know, like, iPhone, you know,
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.960]  the headline iPhone XR sales are in the tank gets a lot more clicks than iPhone XR is doing great.
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:17.520]  Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's like, because if you say, oh, iPhone XR is selling pretty well,
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.720]  you know, as to be expected to the mix, the mixes to the higher end, everybody just kind of like,
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.680]  oh, okay, more of the same. And that doesn't engender excitement as much as, oh, iPhone XR
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.960]  sales are taking a shit and maybe Apple, the golden child is going to fail this time, you know,
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:37.680]  and which I think is the motivator behind a lot of people pursuing those stories, because we're
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.400]  and I'm not even saying it's just like everybody's looking for something negative to say it because
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:48.640]  that's that is true with some reporters, but it certainly is also true that the news industry
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:53.760]  values things that are different, right? Like you're reporting on change. Reporting on something
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:21:01.360]  that has stayed the same is just not the primary motive of most news writers. They want to see
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.600]  things that are new and different and present those to the audience, which is understandable
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.960]  to some degree. But sometimes new and different, the hunt for new and different, the hunger for it
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:17.200]  can sometimes blind you to the realities of a situation because you want to see something
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.840]  is changing so that you have, you know, the ability to commentate on it or to highlight it
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:29.680]  or to be first to point it out. So we get a lot of people saying things prematurely, not just about
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.520]  Apple, but about a lot of things is sort of a motivator for the news industry. And you have to
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:38.880]  push back against it constantly. And it's hard to do as an editor, as a writer, etc. So I think,
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.720]  you know, part of it is that, you know, the hunt for some new information that is, you know,
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.280]  you're bringing to light for the first time. Sometimes that information is, hey, Apple maybe
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:55.200]  is not doing as well as it used to or whatever, as far as iPhone sales go. But I mean, there are a
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:01.840]  couple leading indicators that we know. One, we know that Apple is selling a shit ton of iPhones,
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:11.520]  but the growth rate of its iPhones sales have slowed in recent years, and that they are making
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:18.000]  up for it by increasing the sales price of iPhones. Like that's in the numbers. It's pretty
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.080]  undisputable that they charge more for them and sell a little bit less of them on a growth rate
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.480]  each year, and have been for the past few years. And so I think that the stock market is always
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.120]  going to remember that stock market does not represent current value of a company represents
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.280]  potential future value. And I think, you know, that yes, that's extremely bare bones for most
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:46.320]  financial writers, but I don't think most readers of those stories, you know, necessarily get it,
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:53.920]  especially once it hits mass media and very, very wide media. But they're looking at the future
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.520]  value of the company and going like, hey, if Apple can't sustain growth, then there's not a lot of
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:03.680]  future growth. And then maybe the stock's not worth as much. And that's what the stock market's
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:11.600]  reacting to. So, you know, it's on one hand, you're going, yeah, their growth is slowing,
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:18.720]  for sure. On the other hand, there is a lot of similarities between these reports and reports in
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:26.160]  the past, because a lot of those reports have been based on single component suppliers, or maybe even
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:32.960]  one or two component suppliers, and that the modern supply chain, especially for a company
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:39.920]  like Apple, who is the biggest company on the planet and has one of the best, most complex
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:48.480]  operations orgs in the world, you know, has always been that the supply chain is super complex.
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:57.760]  And reading into one supplier's ordering sheet is a recipe for for a misreading.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:00.080]  Right. And I think that's still true as well.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:07.040]  I wrote about this on doing Fireball, somebody at Apple, a longtime reader of the site. That's,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.040]  you know, a little birdie with knowledge of the situation just said that they were
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:19.120]  familiar with at least one particular supplier getting cut. And they didn't tell me why didn't
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:23.200]  even, you know, as often as the case, you know, would give, you know, sell a little info and,
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.200]  you know, you have friends like this, you don't ask, you know, if they wanted to tell me what
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:33.360]  the component was, they would have told me. But that it was, you know, all they all they said was
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.800]  that it had nothing to do with any current phone had nothing to do with it's something in the
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.880]  future, you know, presumably I didn't did they didn't even tell me, you know, like next year's
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.560]  phone, but I presume that that's what they meant. And they said that there was a similar situation
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:55.120]  last year that there was a late breaking change to the iPhone 10 are, you know, pretty much,
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:25:00.240]  I would guess I don't know exactly when but I'm going to guess that that's around January, maybe
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.880]  like around right now, like, anything for the 20, like next year's September iPhones, right around
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.440]  now is when they need to make decision, you know, like everything gets Yeah, well, two months ago,
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.360]  but yeah, exactly. Well, now would be a late a very late breaking decision. You couldn't I don't
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.080]  think I think it's too late now to make a major design change, you know, but you could do something
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:30.320]  but something changed with the iPhone 10 are late. And it you know, supplier a who might have had a
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:35.360]  lot of business no longer had the business. And it all got construed in the news as the iPhone 10
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.000]  was last year, iPhone 10 sales must be in the tank, but had nothing to do with the iPhone 10
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.520]  was the 10 are right. And so I think stuff like that happens a lot. I think that the supply chain
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:52.480]  stuff is nonsense. I really do. And I often say like, it's, it's, it's fine to be skeptical. And I
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.760]  still am even with what I'm about to say, I still, you know, I Apple officially says something and I
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.480]  try to treat it always treat it with, you know, some skepticism, you know, don't just take them
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:12.240]  at the word. But in general, when Apple says something on the record, it's usually the truth,
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:17.840]  right? It is they they they're a very clear communicating company. And like, when Tim Cook
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:23.760]  says, you shouldn't listen to the supply chain stories, they're nonsense. I really think that
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:28.720]  he means it. Like, it's not just that he's trying to spin it. Because these stories are usually
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:35.040]  a, they're always bad news for some reason. Like, there's never like, never a story like supply.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.880]  It never goes the other way. Supply supply chain tax to the max iPhone selling off the charts.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.400]  Yeah. Like, somehow, you know, it used to be remember when iPhone was on the rise. And like,
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.040]  there's something new here, you know, like, this is fresh. It was always about how many more units
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.400]  the iPhone was going to sell, you know, but it, you know, things get old things get boring,
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:02.560]  or whatever you want to call it. Right. So the supply chain stuff. I don't go for it. But I
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:07.760]  think it's absolutely true. What you said a couple of minutes ago, like the growth in iPhone units
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:14.880]  is over, like the market is saturated, like, there, you know, we've seen in the thing is that
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.040]  that's coupled with failures in markets where they had an opportunity. So it's not just that, yes,
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.880]  the market is saturated. That is absolutely true. But it's also that markets like India,
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.240]  where they had enormous opportunity. Unfortunately, they failed to capitalize on the
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:39.520]  opportunities. And they had a, you know, they had a sort of misunderstanding of the market there.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.600]  And, you know, aren't able to like capture it as well as they thought they would. And that that,
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:51.200]  I think, kneecap, maybe some potential growth that they thought they had, you know, in the in hand,
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.000]  you know? Yeah. And they're also and, you know, they say this when they do their, you know,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.040]  they talk about it, because it, you know, it matters. But the value of the dollar compared to,
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:08.720]  you know, foreign currencies hurt is hurting Apple in a lot of ways. Like, I just I did my goofy
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:15.840]  little video of the 10 r clear case a week ago on Twitter. And somebody told I forget what country
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.800]  it was, I'm sorry, but somebody told me that it whatever country they live in, it's it costs like
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:28.000]  $80. Like, so in the US, it's a $39 case is 40 bucks. So that's, it's, it's expensive for a
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.080]  phone case. And, you know, Apple's cases are expensive compared to third party cases.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:42.320]  What more expensive than you, you know, most Apple stuff is compared to stuff,
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:50.560]  the cases in particular are very expensive. But that's $40, like $80. That's kind of nutty,
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.200]  you know, like, I'm of the opinion that if you're going to use a case on $1,000 phone,
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:00.240]  $40 actually isn't too much. And if it's actually a better case, and I would argue Apple's cases
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:08.240]  are superior, like, I particularly think their leather cases are excellent. You know, if I had
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.000]  to use a case all the time, I would definitely use an Apple leather case. I think it's, you know,
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.720]  best feeling, best fitting. You know, everything you'd want in a case, in my opinion, worth a
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:27.040]  premium for $1,000 device. But you know, 80 bucks for a plastic clear case, boy, that that's hard.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.760]  That's, that's, that's a hard sell. Like, why even bother selling it? Like, how many of them
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:39.440]  are they going to sell? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, and I don't know whether that's an import
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:44.800]  thing or, you know, where they made them and how they're importing, importing them or whatever the
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:49.280]  case may be. But yeah, that's, that's too expensive. I mean, frankly, the plastic case,
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.680]  I found it to be nice. But in the cardinal sin that it commits, and I don't want to separate
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.240]  this from any other of these kinds of cases, because they all do it, is that the buttons
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.960]  are hard to press. And I'm, it's a, it's a done deal for me at that point. And I know why, you
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.520]  know, it's obviously it's flexible TPU sides. And, you know, they can only make it so flexible until
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:14.240]  the button probably gets unreliable or flimsy, or it tears out or whatever, you know, the little,
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:20.640]  little button mold. But once a button becomes hard to press that case is dead to me. And like,
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.280]  that's what I like about their leather ones, they their first leather ones had this solid button.
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.280]  Yeah, you know, like, it was just like a bump, essentially, that you could shove on,
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.720]  and it would press the button underneath. And the newer cases have this nicely,
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:39.680]  you know, kind of debossed little arrangement where there's a it's more flexible in that little
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.600]  hole. And so when you press it, it's like a nice snap, you can feel the button underneath, right.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:48.480]  And like, that's high, you know, absolutely, you can tell that this, they've been making this case
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.280]  for a while, and I've iterated on it, you know, from the first ones, and certainly better now.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.560]  But the plastic one for me, when you press on it, the buttons, it's just too hard. And it doesn't
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:03.520]  doesn't make sense to me. But you look at that in the context of all the other plastic cases out
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.560]  there. And I go, Yeah, this may not yellow as much. It certainly has less seams than most of
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:15.120]  the plastic cases. It's absolutely cream of the crop in terms of ID, you know, from all the other
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:21.120]  plastic cases out there for however much you could call that on a clear case, you know, but it's
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:24.720]  good. It's the best you could best you could possibly make. But then you look at it and you
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.720]  go like, Okay, well, you know, if you can't sell it for the same price all over the world, then,
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:35.120]  you know, who could, you know, if not Apple, then who could? Yeah, I don't know. I
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:42.800]  Apple sent me the clue. Did they send you one? Yeah, they sent me one. So I didn't pay for the
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:50.640]  Apple one. And I, you know, but I did buy a bunch of others. That people, you know, on Twitter,
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.480]  were saying, Well, I don't see, you know, why would I spend $40 for this where the Spigen has
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.760]  one for 11 bucks. So I bought the Spigen and I had the one from this company I mentioned on a
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:04.480]  couple episodes ago, total Lee, which is such a crazy stupid name, but they're very,
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:10.560]  they're like the wire cutters, like top rated, nice budget casemaker, that totally one and the
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.600]  Spigen one are very, very similar. They're much more rubbery than apples. They're they're sort
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:21.760]  of a softer rubbery type thing. The Spigen one is crazy, though it they it's a clear case,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:29.280]  and they've printed their logo on the one side. They've printed in small print on the other side,
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:35.440]  like right on the side underneath the volume buttons they've printed in in myriad. So that's
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.480]  Apple's old font they've printed like design designed by Spigen in California manufactured in
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:48.240]  China or wherever. And then up on the top, the craziest part is they it it has a thing that says
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.800]  like air gap protection. And then there's like an arrow pointing to the corner of the kid. This is
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:03.280]  printed on the actual case now. It's just a marketing phrase printed on the case. It's not
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.880]  printed like in black ink. It is I guess it's just embossed or something like it's like a frosted
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.040]  ink or something. Yeah, you have to look for it to see it like at a glance. If I had this case,
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.680]  you wouldn't see that, you know, you would think it was just a clear case. You wouldn't think
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.320]  there's a logo and there's small print and this, you know, crazy thing telling me that the corners
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:28.960]  have a air gap trademark, you know, protection. But I noticed it and it's supposed to be a clear
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:35.120]  case, right? Like, why would you print anything on there would drive me insane using that on my phone.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:45.200]  Yeah, and I think that that willingness to be chill about that stuff is certainly, you know,
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:51.600]  has been an Apple trademark for a while in their design. But it really does not, by its nature,
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.240]  it doesn't jump out at you until you use some other product that is by definition not chill
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:02.880]  about it. And you're like, wow, okay, I get it. Like, you know, this is your brand. But really,
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.560]  do I need to all this, you know, and it makes it even worse is like, Apple has more of an excuse
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.440]  than anybody else to plaster Apple logos all over, right? Because the Apple logo represents, you
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.040]  know, some sort of high end product and, you know, well designed, like it has a lot of implications,
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:23.600]  right? Whereas, you know, I don't think anybody's gonna be like, Oh, my God, is that a Spigen?
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.160]  Oh, right. You know, oh, my Oh, grace gracious. Oh, you sprung for the Spigen man, you must be
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.880]  doing well. You know, and I think, I think that they're saying, you know, there's a disconnect
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.600]  there. And it's certainly hard to appreciate until you're faced with it, right? Where you're like,
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:45.680]  Oh, thanks for not putting your shite all over everything, Apple, you know, right. Yeah,
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:53.200]  there's, you know, it would be, it would be so tragic, like, if, you know, this generation,
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:58.320]  you know, like 20 years from now, and, you know, Phil Schiller is retired, and, and, you know,
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.880]  new people are coming up the ranks at Apple, and they start making everything with six Apple logos
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:10.480]  everywhere. Yeah, there's this, there's this design trend in sneakers right now, that is,
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.440]  you know, it's basically called overbranding or overbranded. And, you know, it is what it is,
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.760]  right? It is what exactly what it sounds like, where, like a Nike shoe will have like six Nike
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:26.240]  logos on it, you know, or, you know, sweatshirt may have a repeating pattern of Nike logos
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.880]  across its face and back, you know, because it's, it's sort of, people love the brand and want to,
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:39.200]  want to rep the brand, and the brand itself has transcended whatever it used to be, like, hey,
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:44.560]  orientation logo to show you that, yes, you're buying a Nike thing, like a stamp of
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:49.280]  officiality, you know, of some sort, it's transcended all that, and it's become its own
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.200]  pop art almost, you know, and you could absolutely see, like a point where you have like, you could
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:00.320]  have like a MacBook with like a, you know, an Apple print across it, like just the apples and
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.360]  repeating pattern across the face of it or whatever is like a special edition. I hope they
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.120]  don't go that way. I'd certainly, I think it's fun sometimes in a sweatshirt. I would want it on a
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:17.440]  piece of electronics, but it is, I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that kind of stuff,
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:21.440]  at least from their accessories, because, you know, Apple does like to hire designers to play
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.680]  with their accessories and to make interesting things. So I'm surprised we haven't seen like an
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.640]  overbranded Apple, you know, kind of case or, you know, iPad case and stuff like that.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.800]  Yeah. And I could sort of see that, you know, it, they probably could make it work like some,
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:40.080]  you know, like the way that like Louis Vuitton sells stuff with that LV, the LV logo in a,
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:47.040]  in a repeating pattern. Like I could see like an Apple watch strap that, that has like, you know,
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:54.000]  a repeating pattern of Apple logos. Like there's ways that it could be done well, but I don't know.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.320]  Just as easily. Yeah, exactly. Spike it, spike it, spike it. Just as easily. It could be gauche,
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.600]  you know, and it's a clear case. That's supposed to be invisible. Like why would you print?
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.800]  Yeah, yeah, exactly. Well, like, look, I don't want to like wax Rapsodic about this case any
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:15.520]  longer than we have to. But, and I, as I said, I already, I'm off the market for this case because
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:21.920]  of the buttons. Like I can't use it because of that. Right. But the, the fact that they
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.760]  are showing restraint is nice. You just have to say, look, this is the only company on earth
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.320]  that's going to be like, no branding means no branding. It's a clear case. Let's honor the
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:38.560]  truth of a clear case. Right. And I like, I get, I got crap about defending the original battery
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.520]  case, which there's like some FCC approvals or something like that shows that maybe we have a
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:49.040]  new battery case coming. Oh really? I didn't see that. Yeah. Yeah. I think MacRumors had the
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:56.240]  original story, but I could be wrong. But basically the, or, or maybe nine to five Mac,
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:38:00.560]  one of those two, I'm sorry, gents, if I'm misappropriate that you can find it and put
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:05.680]  it in the notes, but basically they found, even if it was nine to five Mac, I'm sure MacRumors
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:12.720]  had a copy of the story. I had it pretty quickly. Yeah. The, the original case, you know,
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:17.440]  that battery case, obviously the, the quote unquote controversy over it was that it had
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:23.200]  this big lump on the back, you know, um, that the battery, basically they just wrapped the,
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.080]  the plastic of the case itself right around the battery and the battery showed through the case.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.920]  And everybody thought, Oh my God, how hideous and all this stuff. And me on the other hand,
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:37.600]  I'm like, well, I mean, it's a battery case and the case shows the battery and it's,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.680]  that's pretty honest as far as I'm concerned. There's not, cause in most of those cases,
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:48.560]  there's actually a lot of air in there because they sort of create a smooth transition between
[01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:55.040]  the battery and the back of the phone. And so they have to create this big bulbous sort of enclosure
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:01.120]  right around it so that it doesn't have that lump. Right. Whereas on the other hand, Apple's like,
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:07.120]  well, why all this extra plastic and air to add extra bulk to it? Why don't we just, you know,
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  put the bare minimum of plastic on this necessary to cover it and to make it a case and that's it.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:18.480]  And we're done. And I actually appreciated that. I thought that was clever and I, I did not have a
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:23.360]  problem with that even though everybody else did pretty much on the planet. I hated the sheep of
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:31.040]  that case. I was with you. Uh, I'm also of, of the mind that I don't think that the way you charge
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:38.000]  the mighty mouse is ridiculous. I'm okay with the lightning port underneath because you only need to
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:44.160]  plug it in for a couple of minutes and it gets a charge for months. And if they put it where
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.040]  everybody thinks it should go so that, you know, it would plug in the top, it would do, you'd have
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:54.000]  to design a totally different mouse. There's no, there is no room for a port given the design of
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.840]  that mouse. Well, John, you're on your own with the mighty mouse, but I appreciate you making the
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:08.320]  argument. I, I'm just saying I'm not, I, you know, I don't have one, so I haven't like had to use it
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.840]  or experience it. I have one that came with my iMac years ago and I've, you know, I don't know,
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:17.760]  it's just sitting on a shelf somewhere. So maybe, maybe I shouldn't speak to it because I don't use
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.200]  it. But anyway, I was fine with the battery case too. The other thing with the battery case design
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:30.080]  was it wasn't just a truthfulness, like here's the battery. It was also by putting it in,
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.600]  by centering it, it, it meant there was no battery covering the antennas at the top or
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:41.840]  bottom. And that's a huge problem with these battery cases because all of the, the, the
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.640]  materials are put two and two together there. That makes a lot of sense. The materials in a battery
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.920]  are not good for a cell phone reception or any antenna reception. I don't know, you know,
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:57.600]  probably all of them, Bluetooth, wifi, everything. And so that, that if you think about that, that,
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.880]  that the, where the battery hump was, it's away from the top and bottom and that's why.
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:09.120]  And apparently that's, and you know, they, you know, all a battery case for a battery case to
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:15.440]  work, it has to be, well, I guess it doesn't have to, somebody could obviously just make
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.840]  some crazy uncertified lightning connector and use it, but because it has to have a lightning
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:27.760]  connector, it has to be MFI certified. And apparently, you know, there's this whole,
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:36.080]  actually we can talk about the cables, but the, this whole MFI thing is fascinating,
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.200]  but nobody really like, Nilay Patel has said that, you know, the Verge has been trying to get the
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.320]  story for like over a year and they just, they, they're coming up empty because nobody will talk
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.960]  about it because of the, the terms of the agreement, you know, and there's, it's like,
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:58.640]  you become an MFI license licensee and you you're subject to like big fines. I mean,
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:04.080]  like $10 million fines or something, if you, you know, like get talk, talk about the confidential
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:12.560]  nature of the agreement. So nobody talks about it. So it's a very secretive world, which in turn,
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:17.120]  you know, and you know, you're in the business too. It, it makes you think, well, that's a good
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:23.440]  story, right? Like, right. Yeah, it does. You hear, this is secretive and, and there's all
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.720]  sorts of crazy rules and instantly, you know, your light bulb goes on, you think I would like
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.200]  to have that story from who can I get to talk about? But apparently with battery cases in
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.000]  particular, you know, part of it is just Apple being Apple, but part of it too is that they,
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.800]  you know, they don't want you to, they don't want, they're not going to certify a case
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.360]  if you put your iPhone in the case and all of a sudden it, it gets bad cell phone reception,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.520]  because who are, who are people going to blame? They're going to blame Apple, right? People
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.480]  aren't going to think, and it's natural, right? You would think, you know, you know, brand X,
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.840]  let's just say, you know, you know, or let's just say like Mophie. I don't know. I mean,
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.840]  Mophie makes cases, but they're a well-known brand. Their cases are fairly premium priced.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:17.440]  So you would think, you know, well, this isn't going to, you know, make my cell phone not get
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:22.800]  good wifi, right? But if you're, so you would, it just, you would just think like, all of a sudden,
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.400]  if everything, you know, your cell phone is slow and you start missing phone calls or phone calls
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.600]  drop or whatever, you wouldn't think to blame the case. You would just think it's a problem with
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:35.920]  your phone. Right. But that's why there's so few, there are, there just aren't many battery cases,
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:43.600]  you know, and there's, there was none for the 10. Right. Right. Right. And Mophie's just came out,
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.320]  but that's for the iPhone 10. And I don't think it's certified for the 10 S, even though the
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.200]  tennis is almost the same size, it just has like a slightly different camera bump. Well,
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:00.960]  and the antennas are different too. So I don't know if that makes any difference, you know?
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.800]  Yeah. The MFI thing is strange. I mean, it's certainly, I've heard very much the same,
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.600]  you know, very draconian terms and they like to keep it secret and all of that stuff. And
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.560]  everybody's reluctant to talk about it. They certainly have been reluctant with me as well.
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:21.200]  I have been able to talk to some of them. I think when it, when it comes to a real pain point,
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:26.880]  they're willing to talk because they view the press as a crowbar of sorts, you know? I just,
[01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:31.360]  I don't think that that, that this scenario is necessarily a big pain point for them. It's just
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.320]  sort of, you know, the cost of doing business and what they expect. You know, I don't think any of
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.840]  them are, are really worrying about these things like, like we as consumers may do because to them,
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.360]  it's money. And so they're making money and they don't really care. The last time I was able to
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:54.240]  shake anything loose out of that whole sort of cabal of manufacturers was when the home stuff
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:00.240]  started transitioning to, you know, kind of a more secure chip. You know, they, they were sort of
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.360]  willing to talk about it to a degree because there was some pain there because they had to switch to
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:13.040]  a hardware solution that was more specific and it caused delays. And they were, essentially all the
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.840]  manufacturers are getting blamed for the delays. When in reality, it's like, Apple's like, Hey,
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:22.720]  you got to do this thing. It's harder. It's better for security. It'll be better for customers. And
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:28.080]  they were right, you know, in, in the end, of course, but it still caused them a lot of grief
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:34.320]  and a lot of sort of customer blowback and bad publicity or whatever. So people were more willing
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:39.760]  to kind of talk to me and say, look, here's what happened. You know, Apple says this new home
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.760]  system, you know, has to have, you have to have this hardware chip has to have hardware protection
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:49.600]  has to have this strong kind of like essentially two factor, you know, authentication that says
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:54.400]  that I'm a, I'm the owner of this hardware device and you know, all of that, which makes it better
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:00.560]  than most of the, the smart home stuff out there and harder to, to kind of circumvent, you know,
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:06.800]  get, you know, Apple nanny cams or MFI nanny cams that are easy for people to stoop on, you know,
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.920]  by extension of all of this. But I certainly think that there is an opportunity. There was
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.960]  an opportunity them for them there to be like, we need people to know this is Apple, you know,
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.360]  causing this delay and not us. So when it comes to that, so that's what you need to do. If you
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.080]  really want them to talk, you need to find the pain and leverage the pain. I mean, I'm just
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.960]  speaking as a, as a reporter here, this is, this is the way you do it. You know, you go, what's your
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:35.520]  pain point? You know, do you want to talk about it? You know, let's, let's discuss it. What's the
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.680]  issue? And then of course, from that point, you do your due diligence and figure out whether,
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:45.520]  you know, they have a it has merit or not. But that's how you get to open up about this. And I
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.520]  just don't think it's too much of a pain right now because they're making money and everything's fine,
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:54.800]  you know? All right, let me take a break here. Thank our third sponsor. It's trace
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:47:02.720]  Pontes. Trace Pontes sell single family estate coffee. It's owned by the race family in Brazil,
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:10.080]  and it is terrific coffee. They describe it as premium select coffee. I'll tell you what
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.640]  it is. It's good coffee. That's what it is. One of the things that's great about it is that they
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:19.280]  don't, it's, it's so easy to decide which one to get, because it's not like they've got like 20
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:25.600]  different varieties. It's one variety of coffee. That's just good, good coffee. And you select
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:32.080]  the roast. They've got like a light roast, a medium roast, darker roast, and then the French
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:36.960]  roast is like the darkest. You can if you want to get started, you can just buy a couple if you're
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.800]  not sure what type of roast you like. I personally I like I like the light or the medium. I'm not a
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:50.960]  dark roast coffee person. But you might be some people are you can buy, you know, three or four
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:58.960]  three or four different varieties. See which one you like best. And the thing about coffee,
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:04.720]  I always mention it with this is that coffee is a perishable item. It's almost more like a fruit.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:11.040]  It is something that loses. It doesn't like go bad, but it loses freshness. You want fresh
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:16.560]  coffee. When you buy Trace Pontas coffee, they roast it and ship it to you. They're roasting it
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.480]  themselves. They tell you the date is on the package like and I have this description now
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:27.520]  and a lot of times the coffee is at my house. Ding Dong, there's the shipment. Here's the box.
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:32.320]  And I look and the date of the roasting was like two days before it's in my hands. Like that's how
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:37.280]  fresh it is. You can get it at Amazon, go to Amazon and search for Trace Pontas. And when you
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:43.840]  get it from Amazon, they encourage you to do it. It's still shipped and fulfilled from the Trace
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.000]  Pontas people. It's not sitting in an Amazon warehouse. You're getting the same fresh coffee.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:56.160]  It's really great. So here's the thing. You can just buy coffee, of course, but they also have
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.480]  subscriptions and a subscription. You can sign up to get some every week, every two weeks or
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.000]  every four weeks. It's your choice. You can change it anytime. And when you sign up for a coffee
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:12.480]  subscription, you save 10% off every bag of coffee. Now they've also got a special deal
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.920]  for listeners of the talk show. If you use the code, the talk show at checkout, when you buy
[01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:24.480]  a coffee subscription, you save an extra 10%. So you as a listener of the show will be saving 20%
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:29.600]  on every bag of coffee when you get a subscription. Not a bad gift idea either.
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.160]  If there's anybody on your holiday shopping list left and you don't know what to get them
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:40.640]  and they like coffee, why not pay for a one year subscription to Trace Pontas? Give them the gift
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:45.520]  of coffee that keeps on giving. And the other thing they have, again, they don't even pay me
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.880]  to say this. I'm supposed to tell you about the coffee, but they've got olive oil too that comes
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:57.600]  from a single farm in Chile, I believe. And it's good. They sent me this olive oil. It's really
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:03.760]  good olive oil. So you think, well, what? That's weird. Why would somebody sell coffee? Why would
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.040]  they sell olive oil too? It seems like a weird pairing. That's sort of what the Trace Pontas
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:13.600]  brand is, is they're just sort of going around the world to find single family farms that grow
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.120]  really good gourmet products. And then they bring them to the United States and around the world.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:24.000]  That's what they're doing. So it's not really, I've never heard of a company that sells olive
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.320]  oil and coffee before, but it makes sense when you think about it that way. So my thanks to them,
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:35.680]  go to tracepontas.com and remember that code, the talk show, and everybody gets free shipping
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:41.840]  in the USA, whether you go to Amazon or if you go to the Trace Pontas website, tracepontas.com
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:48.400]  slash coffee, if you just want to start at the coffees. So here's the thing on the MFI thing I
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:58.080]  wrote recently about the weirdness of the USB-C cables right now and how it is. We're so many years
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:05.840]  into the USB-C Apple world, right? Like the MacBook. And now all of the new MacBooks come
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:11.840]  with USB-C, right? It's now that the Airs come out, the new Airs come out where they still sell
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.440]  the old Air, but in terms of what's the latest model, all of the MacBooks now are USB-C.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.000]  But the only two cables in the world that you can buy that go from USB-C
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.160]  to Lightning are Apple's cables. They have a one-meter cable and a two-meter cable.
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:35.680]  Apple's cables, much like their cases, pretty expensive compared to third parties.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:41.840]  And unlike their cases, which I would argue are actually some of the best cases in the world,
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.520]  their cables, maybe the quality is not that so great. Certainly the durability on Lightning
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:56.240]  cables is questionable. Yeah, yeah. And I believe Marco posted this and it made complete
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:02.960]  sense to me the immediate moment I read it. But with the Lightning cables, a lot of the
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:06.720]  durability issues of the cables obviously are based on the cable relief and all of that, which
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.920]  is obviously physical and very easy to see. But I was encountering this period, this issue
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:19.920]  on my cables a lot, and I couldn't quite pin it down why they were failing on me.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:26.720]  And I finally was able to figure it out via reading this and it made complete sense. But
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:32.960]  they were coming up with these like blackened pins on them and then becoming very difficult to
[01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.640]  use to charge. You'd like flip them over and try and scratch them off with your finger and stuff
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:41.600]  like this. But apparently the pins, you know, well not apparently, I do know this for a fact,
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:49.200]  the pins to connect to charge and to transmit data are in the iPhone, right? So they're
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:54.480]  obviously they're not on the cable, the cable itself is flat contacts. And the sort of pins
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:06.240]  on the iPhone are what, you know, make the contact. Well, those pins get bent. And when
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:12.560]  one of them gets bent, it creates this sort of like short problem, which kind of creates that
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.960]  carbonization, the blackening on that contact on the cable. And then they no longer charge
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:23.440]  properly. And this has been happening to me for years. And you know, ever since they kind of
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:30.320]  switched over to this new pin system, and it's frustrating, you know, your cables perfectly fine,
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:35.120]  other than that you got one pin that's blackened, and it barely connects to the cable.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:39.120]  And, and it barely charges, and you got to scratch it with your fingernail to try and clean it. And,
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.920]  you know, maybe you can use an eraser or whatever. But the long story short is, it's, it's kind of a
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:50.320]  flaw. I mean, not kind of flaw, it is a flaw, you know, and like that, that to me, is irritating,
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:54.720]  because like the rest of lightning, I have no problem with I'm unlike a lot of people who are
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:00.000]  USB C fanatics, and, you know, fine, whatever you like USB C, cool. It works fine on the iPad,
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.760]  you know, I'm fine with it, I'm down. But at the same time, I don't have any problem with
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:08.640]  lightning. And it's been around a long time, there's a lot of buy in now. It's fine. But
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:13.360]  if it doesn't work, it didn't work. Well, the thing that I learned, I guess I shouldn't be
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.360]  surprised. But what I learned when I started looking into this, why are there no third party
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:27.680]  USB C to lightning cables is that every single MFI licensed lightning cable is you have to buy
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:33.600]  the actual lightning connector from Apple, like, it's not like that you license a design, and you
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:41.760]  get you as a cable, you know, like whoever makes Amazon's lightning cables, or I always forget
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.720]  their name, what's the name, mono price, mono price, you know, as is one of my favorite places
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.800]  to buy cables, because their prices are good, and the cables are, you know, the prices are really
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.520]  low, and the cable quality is very good. But the actual lightning connector, even for mono price,
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.680]  or, you know, who makes millions and millions of cables, they all come from Apple. And the
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:09.760]  obviously, it's like, you need a new lightning connector for the USB C ones, because it can do
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:18.880]  higher power, right, you can plug, you can plug that into an 85 watt MacBook Pro charger, right,
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:24.080]  and you're not going to get 85 watts to charge your phone, but the cable needs to negotiate that,
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:32.320]  you know. Whereas the old USB a connector, you know, the lightning cable that we all have a
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.680]  million of all over the place, you know, the most powerful thing you can plug that into as a USB
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:44.320]  port is, you know, like 18 watts or something. Right. And so Apple, you know, and Mac rumors
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:50.560]  had a story I linked to it. Supposedly, this problem, this log jam will be solved early in
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:57.600]  2019. That Apple is, you know, the gears are in motion and third party companies are have been
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.840]  told by Apple that they will get these, you know, these new lightning connectors will be available
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:07.360]  in 2019. But they they're like four bucks each. They're like twice the cost. So every single one
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:13.040]  of those every, even when you buy a third party cable app, there's like a $4 lightning connector
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:19.200]  that Apple sold to the company. Yeah, and that's a huge expense for those companies. Yeah, yeah,
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.880]  especially, you know, I mean, I don't know what Monoprice will, you know, charge. But, you know,
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:28.480]  if they're selling $10 cables, and it has a $4 lightning connector, that's, you know,
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.520]  right, a significant portion of the cost. It's enormous, right, right. And Monoprice is sort of
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:39.600]  known for passing on the savings to the customer, so to speak, by, you know, producing and, you
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.040]  know, producing the cables directly or buying them direct from the factory and selling them.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:48.240]  And they're decent cables, you know, I've always used their stuff in a wide variety of audio,
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.440]  and video applications. It's always been great. But when you cut into their margins that hard,
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.960]  then you start to go like, hey, how, how long are they going to stand for it? You know?
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.880]  Yeah, and I don't even know that it's, you know, I don't think that they're raising the prices on
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.480]  it just arbitrarily. I think it actually is a more expensive, you know, it makes sense that it would
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:11.280]  be more expensive if if it supports, you know, it's technically more difficult because it's
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.200]  whatever. But yeah, and you know, Apple makes a ton of devices. But still,
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:24.160]  when you look at every USB C device, period versus only lightning devices, it's probably there's
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.120]  probably a disparity there. The other thing I learned after I wrote about scale that I got an
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:39.200]  email from a reader, you know, who's who is in the third party, lightning world. And they told me
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.760]  that last year, there were like, I don't know, four or five months where there were no lightning
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.960]  connectors available to third parties period. Because Apple was consuming the entire supply,
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.080]  every single lightning connector that was being made Apple needed because they were putting three
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.600]  in every box with the iPhone 10. And I was like, that doesn't make any sense. Why would there be
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.440]  three lightning connectors in the iPhone 10 box? But you think about it, there were there was one
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:14.240]  for the charger cable, one for the headphones, and then one for the headphone adapter. And it
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:19.520]  literally they did that. And you know, what, how many do they sell a quarter? They sell, I don't
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.920]  know, 70 million iPhones. I don't know how many iPhone 10s they sold, because they didn't break
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:28.560]  it down. But, you know, figure 50 million or something like that. So, you know, 50 million
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:34.800]  iPhones means 150 million lightning connectors in the boxes. Jesus. Yeah, when you think of the
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:41.600]  scale, it's pretty, pretty wild. Yeah. And so that means, you know, the third parties,
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:48.560]  unfortunately, I mean, not only is Apple making money, but they also have the sort of set up the
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:53.760]  room where a delay like that is not going to kill them, even if it happens, but a third party,
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:58.400]  that might kill them, you know, like, if you're trying to make cables, and you think you got
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:03.440]  a unique marketing spin, hey, we're gonna make cables that are pink, you know, or wrapped in
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:08.960]  horsehair or whatever, you know, whatever they do. If you're basing your business off of those
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:14.240]  those connectors, you're kind of boned, you know, you don't have the runway to make up for that.
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:21.920]  Yeah. I just is mind boggling to me that that you just don't think of that. But it really could be
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:28.080]  the case that, you know, one of the reasons they don't give you the headphone adapter anymore is
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:34.400]  that it's they don't have enough. Well, that, you know, making when you when you're working at the
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:40.320]  iPhone scale, it really does. It really makes a difference. You know, 50 million extra headphone
[01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:46.320]  adapters is is like a serious operational issue. Right? I mean, even if it costs them 50 cents,
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:51.600]  that's $25 million. Right? It's and I guarantee it probably costs a little bit more than that.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:58.640]  Yeah. I don't know. It's kind of mind boggling. Anything else? What else do you want to talk about?
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.640]  I can't I can't think of anything burning at the moment.
[02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:12.800]  The only other thing I just want to touch on briefly is the the MacBook Air, the new MacBook
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:21.840]  Air. And is it? Is it? I like it. And I tend to think that that is, you know, just the nut of my
[02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:28.320]  review was this is the MacBook that most people should buy. And I've seen some pushback on that
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:36.480]  on the grounds of why would you know, why buy the MacBook Air instead of the the 13 inch MacBook Pro
[02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:44.000]  without the touch bar, the aka the MacBook escape, because it's it's significantly faster, only
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.480]  marginally heavier, it's like a quarter of a pound or something, but pretty insignificant. And even
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:57.200]  in terms of thickness, it's it's like the teardrop shape of the air is sort of an illusion, you know,
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:02.480]  that it's really just the side and that if you actually put them side by side, by it's actually
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:10.720]  not that much smaller by volume. And I don't know why I feel now I still I still like the air. I
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.840]  don't know why that is. I'm curious what your thought is, you know, a month now. And you know,
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:19.680]  now that it's been out for a while, and it's not new where your thoughts have settled on the MacBook
[02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:27.920]  Air versus Yeah. The keyboard is better. Yeah, Mac books, well, good pros, you know. And by better,
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:33.040]  I mean, it has a different feel. And if you like that different feel, it's better, you know, right.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.840]  And I'm, I'm fine with the price. I have a pro and I'm fine with the keyboard. To be honest,
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.200]  it doesn't bother me. But I certainly understand that a lot of people, it does bother them. And if
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.440]  it bothers you, it's a great option, you know, especially if you type a lot and don't do a lot
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:57.600]  of other things, you know. And I think the same people that argue that Chromebooks are just fine,
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:03.600]  because we do all of our work on the web now, etc, etc. You know, this is an excellent computer
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:09.760]  for that kind of workflow. So if you're if you're a student, and you do a lot of your work in Google
[02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:15.200]  Docs, or, you know, in corporate world and do a lot of your work in Google Docs, I mean, there's
[02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:22.080]  it's hard to argue, it gets a computer like the air, which may not edit video all that fast,
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:29.040]  but certainly is an excellent overall computer, and lighter or lighter than the MacBook Pro for
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:36.960]  sure. And, and great keyboard and proven to work for a long period of time. You know, it's it's
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:43.360]  hard to argue against it as an option. I feel that I still like the shape of it. I like the angle.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.880]  I like you know, my hand rest feels it feels better there. I don't like the high lip of the
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:56.080]  MacBook Pro. Yeah, I tend to I tend to have a little bit lazier, you know, typing stance.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.640]  So I like the fact that it has that nice low lip so I can kind of rest my arms on the table.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:09.760]  I like the shape of it. It's pleasant. I just think there's not a lot to recommend against it.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:14.880]  It's not so much as I'm advocating for it as like, you know, the best computer or whatever.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:19.920]  It's just there's, it's hard to find arguments against it. It's like, why, why, why don't you
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:24.560]  want it? And the arguments against it, I think, are largely centered on, well, wouldn't you want
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:29.440]  the maximum performance or the price? Right. And I think for some people, that's absolutely true.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:34.880]  Sure. You know, if you're if you're, you know, burgeoning YouTube star, you should get a MacBook
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:41.920]  Pro, so that you can edit your videos and save time, save time. Exactly. Save time on your
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.960]  rendering and export all of that stuff. It makes total sense for you to consider it from that
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:52.240]  angle from that perspective. But you know, if you're a student who wants a computer that is,
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:58.080]  you know, a reasonable price, certainly cheaper than a MacBook Pro, but does everything pretty
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:04.640]  much by the book and is really well proven at this point, I think a lot of people are completely fine
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:09.520]  to say, Oh, you should wait and buy the next gen, you know, whenever any new Apple product comes
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:14.800]  out. And they're right to many degree, you know, in many ways, there's always some weird little
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.720]  quirks when Apple kind of invents something new, because it's completely fresh. And the second
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:27.120]  generation is often fixes those problems. This is proven and very well known. Well, you really can't
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:32.240]  get much more nailed down than this. Right. You know, if you're if you want to talk about reliable
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:40.080]  and lack of fuss, and probably not a lot of weird manufacturing quirks or any issues. This is an
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:48.080]  extremely proven design and platform. So it's also going to be reliable and going to be you're gonna
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:52.960]  have a lack of surprises on that front. And the air is still, you know, a month old or six weeks
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:57.920]  old, however long it's been, but the third generation keyboard design came out in the summer
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:04.560]  with the touch bar MacBook Pros. And, you know, six months is, you know, you expect to get a lot
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:09.440]  more than six months out of a keyboard. So we'll see how it goes. But so far, anecdotally, it seems
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:14.880]  like this third generation design with the membrane has solved the reliability problems with
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:20.160]  the keyboard. I mean, it right. I'm not saying nobody has an issue with the keyboard, but it
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:25.040]  certainly doesn't. It seems like the problem that was a real problem has been solved.
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:31.360]  Yeah, I don't, I the reliability for sure seems to be better. I don't know if it has fixed any
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:36.480]  problems re people's feel, you know, if people have problems with the field, they probably,
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:43.280]  I don't know if it has rectified all that much for them. But it's certainly from a reliability
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:49.760]  perspective, I think that people seem to feel better about it. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good summary.
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:55.200]  That's probably my take too. I still feel I'm still a big fan of the new air. I really, really
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:59.520]  like it. Yeah, I am too. I mean, I don't think it's irrational either. You know, I think some
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:03.760]  people want to put it in that bucket. You're like, Oh, you just like it because, you know,
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:08.800]  of what it used to be or the concept, you know, the original concept. And I think the concept
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:13.600]  still holds up. It's a light computer. It's extremely pleasantly shaped. It's well made.
[02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.720]  And it does exactly what you need it to do. You know, what more do you want? Yeah.
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:21.440]  Well, thank you for your time. It's always good to talk to you. Have a good holiday.
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:26.960]  Have a good holiday season. Yeah, everybody can. Everybody can can see your work at tech crunch,
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:36.320]  of course, and follow you on Twitter at at Panzer pan z er. My thanks to our sponsors. We had
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:46.320]  line ode trace Pontos and Jamf Jamf. Now where you can manage manager Apple devices. Thank you,
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:07:09.120]  Matthew. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
