[00:00.000 --> 00:03.200]  You're a letterman fan uh, yes
[00:04.160 --> 00:09.200]  You've been watching the the end of the show sort of yeah, uh, I watched last night
[00:10.000 --> 00:10.960]  and
[00:10.960 --> 00:12.480]  the night before
[00:12.480 --> 00:15.280]  Yeah, the uh bill murray popping out of a cake
[00:16.720 --> 00:18.720]  That was kind of strange
[00:18.880 --> 00:23.760]  It was like to me. It was a real throwback to the 80s. I mean, that's the type of just
[00:24.380 --> 00:28.720]  Nonsense from the the the late night show in the 80s. Yeah, and
[00:28.720 --> 00:31.840]  And I don't know like some of it. It almost seems like
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.240]  that the
[00:34.240 --> 00:40.160]  fact that bill murray was there was almost wasted but I guess not because so much of it is reminiscing and those and the
[00:41.040 --> 00:43.760]  uh, you know the old videos and that kind of stuff but
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.400]  It was fun
[00:46.400 --> 00:53.360]  Um, so we're recording on wednesday the 20th letterman's final show will air actually he's probably funny. I didn't even think about it
[00:53.440 --> 00:55.680]  He's probably recording it as as we are
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.480]  Well, that's actually kind of oh that just gave me like goosebumps. Should we uh, hang up and go
[01:02.640 --> 01:06.800]  It's it's funny i've never gone i'm a huge letterman fan never once
[01:07.840 --> 01:10.240]  Saw him live and I do kind of regret that
[01:11.360 --> 01:13.520]  I never got to see jordan live either. So
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.520]  Yeah, it's okay. We'll live did I ever see jordan live? I don't think I did. I don't think I did
[01:19.520 --> 01:21.840]  I think I I wasted all of those years. Yeah
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.880]  Uh, I almost had I had tickets once one time early on in the run of um,
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.480]  uh his show on cbs, so this was probably
[01:31.680 --> 01:36.640]  If I think about it's probably 1998 thinking about where I lived I had a roommate for a year
[01:37.280 --> 01:40.480]  and they did a thing where they were going to uh,
[01:42.240 --> 01:43.200]  Have
[01:43.200 --> 01:47.120]  Like a whole week of shows where their audiences were all going to be from the same city
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.240]  And so one night that week the whole audience was from philadelphia
[01:50.240 --> 01:54.800]  And yet, you know, you entered a contest and you did it and my roommate and I thought well, you know what?
[01:54.800 --> 01:59.680]  We've never gone. We've always wanted to see letterman. Let's enter this and we'll be in the philly crowd and we've won
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.840]  And so we got you know, I don't know thousands of people entered we were one of like three, you know
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.240]  300 who got two seats
[02:08.240 --> 02:10.240]  and all we had to do was um
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.600]  Show up for like a bus around noon and they were going to bus everybody up together. Um,
[02:15.600 --> 02:19.520]  and we were getting ready to go and uh, my roommate, uh,
[02:20.080 --> 02:25.520]  Like checked his email and there was a thing that was like all you have to do is click this button by you know last friday
[02:26.640 --> 02:28.560]  And you're good to go
[02:28.560 --> 02:30.560]  and it was like
[02:31.200 --> 02:35.680]  I just looked at him. I was like are you freaking kidding me and he's like, i'm sorry
[02:36.480 --> 02:43.040]  So we won but we didn't claim the tickets in time. And so I guess the idea that the the idea behind it was
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.080]  You know, they want to make sure they they filled the whole theater
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.800]  And so the click the thing was like, okay, you've won but are you sure you're gonna go and then it was like
[02:50.800 --> 02:55.120]  That's all you had to do. But in the meantime, they they filled our seats with the alternates
[02:55.920 --> 02:59.600]  Oh, well, that's a good story probably better than the show would have been
[03:00.160 --> 03:06.000]  Maybe yeah, I don't know. I've never been to any of those tapings and I I even live in new york city and i've been here for
[03:06.720 --> 03:08.240]  now, uh
[03:08.240 --> 03:13.200]  10 years basically and i've never gone to on it, but I I my first year in new york
[03:13.200 --> 03:17.520]  I found some email mailing list where you sign up and you get emails
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.720]  inviting you to be in studio audiences for random stuff and
[03:23.280 --> 03:28.320]  I've never even gone to one of those but it's funny to see the stuff that comes along. It's you know weird game shows and
[03:29.840 --> 03:34.160]  One day maybe i'll go to uh, fallon now that he's he's the man
[03:34.160 --> 03:37.600]  Yeah, or the uh, seth meyer show or so or seth. Yeah
[03:38.640 --> 03:40.240]  I I you know
[03:40.240 --> 03:45.520]  I don't know i'm a little wistful about the letterman thing. I guess I think he's right, you know, it's like one of those things where
[03:47.360 --> 03:52.240]  I think he's right that this is the time to go. I do think he's I think he's I think he's I think he picked the right time
[03:52.240 --> 03:56.480]  I think you know sooner would have been too soon and I think it probably is time
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.520]  But it's still it's like it just it how can you just it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.240]  It how can you not be sad if you're a fan? Yeah, and I wonder how much of it has to do with
[04:09.280 --> 04:15.840]  Not just you know hosting the show but all the other demands that being uh, you know being a public figure in the media today
[04:15.840 --> 04:17.760]  Are for example
[04:17.760 --> 04:19.440]  He doesn't really do anything online
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.120]  He doesn't really do anything in social media and I wonder how much of that gig now is is that sort of stuff?
[04:25.200 --> 04:26.960]  Maybe it's none of it. I don't know
[04:26.960 --> 04:31.680]  No, he's pretty clear about it. Like I think it was in the new york times interview either that or he did two big interviews
[04:31.680 --> 04:35.040]  Recently, which is unusual for him. He's you know, usually pretty reticent
[04:35.600 --> 04:38.880]  But uh, he did the new york times interview and a rolling stone interview
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.000]  um cover story really and uh, I think maybe in both places it was acknowledged that like
[04:44.720 --> 04:46.800]  The game today with the late night show
[04:47.680 --> 04:49.680]  Is partly at least partly
[04:49.920 --> 04:55.760]  To make viral bits that you know that can be separated from the rest of the show five minutes on youtube
[04:55.760 --> 05:01.600]  And can get shared and that he you know, his show really doesn't do that and it's not really set up to do that
[05:02.720 --> 05:05.120]  uh kind of the opposite of john oliver, which is
[05:06.240 --> 05:09.760]  Basically, uh exists to feed the monday morning blogger
[05:10.640 --> 05:11.760]  quota
[05:11.760 --> 05:13.760]  right every single site
[05:13.840 --> 05:15.600]  rushing to uh
[05:15.600 --> 05:17.360]  summarize
[05:17.360 --> 05:22.960]  What he said the night before it is that is exactly what happens with his show. It is so funny. It's like
[05:22.960 --> 05:26.720]  Like it's it's like why don't you just let people watch it? Yeah
[05:28.160 --> 05:30.160]  Well, but that is one way
[05:30.320 --> 05:36.660]  You know wink to let people watch it is to have them watch it on your blog with your you know, your submarine commentary
[05:37.600 --> 05:40.560]  Right. Uh, hey, I really enjoyed uh
[05:41.920 --> 05:47.680]  Your intimate look at your uh, iphone stands and I want to send you mine you posted
[05:48.320 --> 05:50.320]  Uh this weekend daring fireball
[05:50.320 --> 05:55.680]  Your uh, your two iphone docs and uh, I think you'll get a kick out of the one that I bought
[05:56.080 --> 05:59.360]  In tokyo, is this for real? Is this for real? I don't want to even say
[06:01.360 --> 06:03.920]  You did you own this stuff? Yeah, I bought it in tokyo
[06:05.360 --> 06:10.480]  All right. I'm not I don't even think we should talk about i'm going to put it in the show notes right now as
[06:12.000 --> 06:14.000]  dan's iphone
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.000]  doc
[06:16.000 --> 06:22.500]  It's you're you're gonna all gonna have to go and load the show notes and see this for yourself because there's absolutely
[06:22.640 --> 06:27.600]  No way that we can do justice to it unless you really want to talk about it. I'll just tell you the back story
[06:27.600 --> 06:29.600]  I here's what I think
[06:29.600 --> 06:36.800]  I I don't even remember. Uh, well, I know where I found it. I found it in uh, tokyo hands, which is the greatest
[06:37.520 --> 06:39.520]  it's it's kind of a mixture of a
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.400]  home depot and um
[06:42.400 --> 06:47.600]  I don't know like a bed bath and beyond or something like that. I don't know. It's just a great home and
[06:48.160 --> 06:50.240]  hardware store in tokyo and
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.720]  I think it it
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.200]  I don't think it's the same company that makes the
[06:56.240 --> 07:02.640]  Incredibly realistic food models that you would see outside of a japanese restaurant where?
[07:03.760 --> 07:07.680]  Uh, you know the each little piece of sushi looks perfect and that kind of stuff
[07:07.680 --> 07:11.760]  I bought those in the past does this thing have a charger? No, it doesn't
[07:11.760 --> 07:17.200]  No, no, no, so it just props it up. It's just a way to prop up. I have a six plus
[07:17.200 --> 07:19.200]  I don't need a charger, sir
[07:19.360 --> 07:21.360]  uh
[07:21.600 --> 07:22.560]  Anyway
[07:22.560 --> 07:30.000]  The year before I bought this I got an iphone 4s case that that's bacon and eggs and that looks even more ridiculous. But
[07:30.560 --> 07:31.600]  um
[07:31.600 --> 07:33.600]  so this cheeseburger
[07:33.680 --> 07:35.680]  iphone holder is my
[07:35.680 --> 07:41.520]  It's my favorite. I wanted to get one for the office, but I was worried that someone would snag it because it's just so crazy
[07:41.760 --> 07:46.240]  I i've been meaning to write about these iphone docs for a while and it's just one of those things where I didn't really have
[07:46.320 --> 07:49.920]  A reason to and then went at so the thing is is apple came out yesterday, right?
[07:50.000 --> 07:55.360]  And that was the context right with a new lightning thing and it's just been
[07:57.120 --> 07:58.240]  Like
[07:58.240 --> 08:01.360]  Over the I like having an iphone doc a charging doc though. I like it
[08:01.440 --> 08:05.360]  I like did you know if i'm gonna have to charge my phone while i'm at my desk or something like that?
[08:05.360 --> 08:09.040]  I why not have it on a doc. It's better than having it lay down. Um
[08:11.840 --> 08:18.400]  But over the years it's just been like nobody could ever keep it straight like the original iphone shipped with a doc, right
[08:19.200 --> 08:22.000]  It was like right there in the box and it was a great doc
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.720]  And then it didn't fit the 3g or 3gs and it's like oh, well, no
[08:26.800 --> 08:32.000]  And then they didn't come with a doc and then the iphone 4 came out and it turned out the iphone 4 fit in the original
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.800]  iPhone doc really well, even though the iphone 4 had like a sort of square bottom
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.000]  And the original iphone was more like the apple watch sort of a pill shape capsule shape thing
[08:42.400 --> 08:49.920]  It just fit in that the the crevice they had for it almost perfectly and the 30 pin was more than enough to keep it stable
[08:50.400 --> 08:53.360]  So I went back to the original doc with my iphone 4 and 4s
[08:54.400 --> 08:56.400]  but then ever since it's been a
[08:56.800 --> 08:58.800]  It's been a shit show
[08:58.800 --> 09:00.160]  I uh
[09:00.160 --> 09:02.160]  I never had a doc until the
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.840]  elevation doc which came what two weeks before the
[09:06.560 --> 09:07.360]  the
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.680]  The cord switched so that was it for me. I said i'm not buying anymore
[09:12.240 --> 09:15.600]  I somehow wound up with two elevation docs. I think I bought one
[09:15.760 --> 09:19.760]  I did the kickstarter and then I think they sent me one as like, uh, you know, like
[09:20.240 --> 09:23.920]  In my role as a you know, maybe you'll link to it public figure type thing
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.760]  I don't know. I don't remember buying two, but somehow I wound up with two and never used either of them because
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.120]  exactly, they it only shipped like two it was 30 pin and it only shipped two weeks before the
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.640]  The first lightning phone came out. I guess that must have been the iphone 5
[09:39.520 --> 09:41.200]  Yep, right
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.000]  And they did have a thing where you can you can go there now even and get like a kit
[09:46.080 --> 09:50.960]  So you can transform it in from a 30 pin thing to a lightning thing, but I never bothered with that
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.080]  No, who wants to do that? Well, i'm sure some people do it wasn't worth it for me. No nor I
[09:57.040 --> 10:02.720]  Uh, the big things for me with the doc is uh, in most cases you want to be able to use it one-handed
[10:02.960 --> 10:07.200]  In other words, you don't have to put one hand on the dock and one hand on the phone to separate it without
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.560]  Picking up the dock with the phone
[10:12.960 --> 10:18.720]  And you want to be able to fit I like the idea just I mean I waste money on everything
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.840]  Everything I just like the idea though of getting a dock and then being able to use it for maybe more than a year
[10:25.520 --> 10:28.560]  Just in case the iphone shape sizes changes
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.720]  So I like the idea of a doc that is sort of agnostic to the shape of the iphone future proof
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.240]  future proof well, it makes sense too because uh, so many people use a case now
[10:41.040 --> 10:46.240]  and that that's a slightly different shape than a phone with no case or
[10:46.240 --> 10:53.680]  Uh, there are so many different sizes, you know, there's four there's five c five s six six plus
[10:55.520 --> 10:57.920]  So lots of different phones to uh
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.280]  Handle with what with uh one design?
[11:02.240 --> 11:09.360]  Yeah, the new iphone doc from apple seems I i'm curious how I guess i'll buy one just because i'm again i'm really bad with money
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.320]  I don't need it, but i'm curious about how it works
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.760]  So I guess i'll buy one, um, because it doesn't have any kind of the only thing that it's just a lightning
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.240]  Nubbin that sticks out of a flat piece of plastic. There is no back
[11:22.880 --> 11:30.560]  There's no slot that the phone goes into it's just a lightning the lightning port itself is the only thing that's going to support the phone
[11:31.280 --> 11:34.800]  Which sounds like it would be a little fragile, but it I don't know
[11:34.800 --> 11:41.360]  Maybe they've figured some way to make it really sturdy. It makes me feel less irresponsible for picking my phone up by its lightning
[11:41.360 --> 11:43.360]  Cable all the time, which I do
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.960]  Yeah, do you have the problem where you you uh, your lightning cables kind of wear out over time because of that
[11:49.760 --> 11:51.760]  Has not happened yet
[11:51.760 --> 11:57.600]  Uh, in fact the one i'm using now is a third-party one and even that one has has been really good. So
[11:58.480 --> 12:02.160]  Yeah, it seems like it's tricky business designing a doc because like you said
[12:02.160 --> 12:02.640]  All right
[12:02.640 --> 12:08.800]  number one future proving it you want to go for different thicknesses and widths of the iphone and then you want to go case or
[12:08.800 --> 12:12.160]  And then you want to go case or no case and how many you know?
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.240]  How many types of cases can you manage to support etcetera and how how easy do you want to be?
[12:18.800 --> 12:24.000]  Uh to dock and undock it whereas it seems that lightning has its own kind of uh,
[12:24.640 --> 12:26.640]  tension system built in so
[12:27.040 --> 12:28.560]  Yeah
[12:28.560 --> 12:31.760]  Uh, I don't know. I don't you yeah, that's why I don't use a doc
[12:31.760 --> 12:38.400]  I'm, just kind of plug in and flop it down on the table next to me. Hmm
[12:39.360 --> 12:46.080]  Uh, I have a question for you though, which is why do you think they made this or if they'd had it a long time ago?
[12:46.080 --> 12:48.080]  Why do you think they decided to ship it now?
[12:49.040 --> 12:51.280]  Somebody said and I don't know if it's right or not
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.320]  But somebody said on twitter that the docs over the years a lot of them that apple is
[12:56.320 --> 13:02.160]  Apple's own first party doc for iphone has often come out mid cycle on on the iphone that they didn't come out
[13:02.460 --> 13:08.800]  Alongside the phones and I don't know why that would be I saw somebody else who tweeted that I think it was jeremy horowitz
[13:09.120 --> 13:13.680]  Um, who's at nine to five mac now that he I guess he got one already and it
[13:14.480 --> 13:18.180]  Like he read the fine print on the box or whatever and it was 2014
[13:18.960 --> 13:24.400]  So it must have you know, they must have started assembling them months ago, but that didn't start selling them until now
[13:24.400 --> 13:26.400]  I don't quite get it
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.680]  um
[13:27.680 --> 13:29.680]  I think the basic idea though is that
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.800]  For some people a doc whether you use it at your desk or you use it like at your bedside or you have both
[13:35.440 --> 13:37.360]  It's you know, it's a sensible place
[13:37.360 --> 13:39.360]  If you're going to charge your phone at the same place all the time
[13:39.440 --> 13:41.680]  It makes sense to have a doc instead of just a cable
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.800]  I mean if you just have a cable, you definitely can't do it one-handed you need two hands
[13:46.800 --> 13:54.320]  Um, so the one-hand ability is definitely to me a convenience and I get my desk like when i'm developing, you know
[13:54.400 --> 13:56.960]  Working on betas of vesper and stuff like that as a dev
[13:56.960 --> 13:57.840]  I know
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.320]  Almost all developers have some kind of doc so that they can have their phone in a usable readable state alongside their their computer
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.240]  I have some corrections to make. Oh, I should get this out of the way. Let's do it
[14:09.760 --> 14:12.000]  Um, actually a lot of these are pretty old
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  Paul kapos was on the show. I don't know if two months ago, uh, and we were talking about aspirin
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.280]  And whether it was something that was thousands of euros old or like a hundred years old
[14:24.480 --> 14:27.840]  So aspirin as we know it was first produced 110 years ago
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.360]  In the late 1800s sort of a snake oil type thing, but it actually worked
[14:34.160 --> 14:36.640]  But the natural form of it which is called
[14:37.360 --> 14:39.360]  salicylic acid
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.240]  Is found in plants i.e. The willow and myrtle and has been used for thousands of years
[14:44.800 --> 14:51.040]  So that's the source of the confusion as early as 3000 bc the ancient egyptians used willow bark and myrtle
[14:51.600 --> 14:53.600]  To reduce pain and fever
[14:53.840 --> 14:57.440]  And those are some of the ingredients that were used to make aspirin
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.120]  Starting in the late 1800s. So it's sort of a little bit of column a a little bit of column b
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.040]  I have another note here. I don't remember
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.240]  Which show it was I think it was merlin man when we were talking about man. These are old shows
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.280]  Yeah, well, I forgot to look at these notes. I have these notes for all the follow-up all the corrections
[15:17.280 --> 15:22.800]  and I really this should be a very long list because I make a lot of mistakes every episode, um, but when merlin was on and
[15:22.800 --> 15:30.000]  We had a discussion about when to let our our growing children watch which movies and I said that
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.440]  You know caddyshack came up and I said no, of course jonas hadn't seen caddyshack yet
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.160]  And then my wife was actually listening to the show and she goes you dummy. We let him watch caddyshack
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.720]  And I remembered yes, we did. So yeah, so I let my son watch caddyshack when he was I think 10
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.360]  I think that's when I first saw it too
[15:45.760 --> 15:52.480]  That's that's my thinking that was my thinking of of letting him watch my I remember my dad like stood in front of the tv for
[15:52.480 --> 15:56.720]  A couple of minutes, uh during one scene. He's like just look over there for a second
[15:57.600 --> 16:00.880]  And uh, yeah, it's a great movie to see and then you watch it again
[16:00.880 --> 16:06.080]  like 50 times in college and you it's a totally different movie at that point, but uh,
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.920]  Why not yeah, uh again
[16:10.800 --> 16:15.680]  No idea which episode this was for but somebody I I don't I guess we were talking about some of my eye problems
[16:15.680 --> 16:21.360]  And we were talking about uh that warby parker should make a monocle ends up they do make a monocle. Uh,
[16:22.400 --> 16:26.320]  I'll put that in the show notes warby parker does make a monocle. I don't know that I would recommend it
[16:26.320 --> 16:31.200]  it seems to me like that's sort of taken the you know, the hipster, uh
[16:33.600 --> 16:38.400]  The hipster thing a little far going with monocle, but there you go that's marketing man
[16:39.760 --> 16:41.760]  Or be monocle. There he goes right in the show notes
[16:42.800 --> 16:51.600]  Um, uh, joanna stern joanna stern was the great joanna stern was on the show a few weeks ago and we were talking about these
[16:51.600 --> 16:58.240]  And we were talking about these. Um, both of us had turned out bought the same bluetooth
[16:59.040 --> 17:01.040]  headset beats
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.840]  Power beats
[17:03.840 --> 17:05.840]  These little beats power beats are bluetooth
[17:06.320 --> 17:11.120]  They're meant for like, you know, wearing my exercise and stuff. I'd never had bluetooth. You ever had bluetooth headphones
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.120]  No
[17:13.120 --> 17:18.480]  So i'd never had them before and I bought them while I was testing the watch because I wanted to test
[17:18.480 --> 17:23.840]  And these are like the 180 dollar ones. Yeah, they're they're you know, like everything from beats are pretty expensive
[17:24.640 --> 17:27.520]  I find i've been pretty happy with them so far. They're pretty comfortable
[17:27.840 --> 17:32.640]  Um, these are the ones that had that little like kind of finger coming off them that holds in your ear
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  Yeah, sort of there's like a thing that wraps around your ear and then there's a thing that goes in your ear. Yeah
[17:40.720 --> 17:41.920]  um
[17:41.920 --> 17:47.280]  But the complaint we both had was that the latency was really bad just the bluetooth latency
[17:47.280 --> 17:50.800]  So like when you pause it was like it felt to me
[17:50.880 --> 17:51.840]  I don't know what it really was
[17:51.840 --> 17:56.640]  But it felt to me like second or two goes by before the audio actually pauses
[17:56.960 --> 18:00.000]  And then you hit play again and it's a second or two before it plays
[18:00.800 --> 18:06.240]  Uh, which was like driving me nuts and somebody sent in I forget who sorry. I don't remember
[18:06.800 --> 18:12.960]  Um that you got to run the beats updater. There's a firmware update for these headphones you go to uh,
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.520]  I'll put it in show notes, but anybody who bought these things god, it never even occurred to me
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.520]  I guess it makes sense that there would be such a thing
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.360]  But i've never thought of headphones as having firmware that you could update. Um, so you run this beats updater
[18:28.160 --> 18:29.440]  and
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.640]  It still is not quite it. I don't think bluetooth can ever
[18:33.200 --> 18:40.720]  You know is ever going to match the latency of hardware, but you know like a you know a cable but it it's a
[18:40.720 --> 18:44.640]  It it reduces the latency all the way down to what I expected at the outset
[18:44.960 --> 18:47.280]  There's like a fraction of a second where when you pause
[18:47.520 --> 18:52.320]  Until it actually pauses and there's a fraction of a second when you go to restart the audio before it actually starts playing again
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.000]  But it seems totally reasonable and way different than what it was when I opened them out of the box
[18:58.960 --> 19:04.560]  So anybody out there who buys like these beats, uh headphones if you get these bluetooth ones and you find the latency is like
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.640]  Insane, like how could they do this?
[19:06.640 --> 19:14.480]  Uh get this updater. The updater is weird, too. It's like a mac app that you run that then goes to opens a webpage in safari
[19:14.560 --> 19:19.920]  And it's the web page that shows you the progress as it updates a thing that's plugged into your device by usb
[19:20.640 --> 19:25.360]  Very strange, but it worked. Isn't that amazing software update for your headphones?
[19:26.480 --> 19:30.000]  It just never would have occurred to me to look how do you uh, how do you charge them?
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.080]  And how often do you charge them?
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.760]  uh usb
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.200]  You charge them by usb. There's a a little micro usb
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.600]  Thing on the bottom of the left earpiece and it has a rubber
[19:42.320 --> 19:44.480]  Nubbin that covers it I guess for you know
[19:45.120 --> 19:47.120]  sweat and water resistance, um
[19:47.440 --> 19:49.440]  So you just plug it in by usb
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  so the the the
[19:52.080 --> 19:56.080]  the fact that apple made that uh, iphone dock and and
[19:56.080 --> 20:02.720]  Does not yet have uh, a proper charging station is something that that puzzles me. But
[20:03.760 --> 20:05.760]  not you know charging station for what well just
[20:06.480 --> 20:11.200]  Now I have three things I plug in almost every night four if you count this new macbook
[20:11.200 --> 20:13.920]  and now if I get wireless headphones, that's five so
[20:14.800 --> 20:16.160]  um
[20:16.160 --> 20:20.560]  So someone's got to do a really, you know, it could be apple. I don't know someone's got to do the the best
[20:21.040 --> 20:23.040]  charging station possible
[20:23.040 --> 20:29.440]  So how long do they last? I think that they say they last like six hours. Um, I had so that's once a week or something
[20:29.440 --> 20:31.600]  I've been running a lot recently. Um
[20:32.240 --> 20:38.720]  At the last, you know since the weather's gotten nicer and I did have one run where uh, my headphones conked out halfway through
[20:38.960 --> 20:43.280]  And I was very confused. It just was like it just plays like a little sad song like
[20:43.760 --> 20:49.840]  Do do do do do and uh, and then I guess that means we're out of juice. Goodbye and then you got nothing
[20:50.640 --> 20:52.240]  um
[20:52.240 --> 20:55.840]  So, I don't know. I try to remember to charge him every every second day or two. I don't know
[20:56.560 --> 21:01.520]  It's hard to know but you do get a little battery meter in in your status bar in ios
[21:04.400 --> 21:06.400]  So it's like when you have them paired with your phone
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.880]  It shows up in between your phone's battery
[21:12.640 --> 21:18.640]  Indicator and the little bluetooth icon in the status bar. There's a little vertical battery a little tiny one
[21:18.640 --> 21:24.960]  It's actually hard for me to see um, but I can kind of get a rough picture of whether it's like mostly full or mostly empty
[21:26.160 --> 21:29.680]  So you can see the battery on your phone of the charge of your headphones
[21:30.800 --> 21:37.360]  It's all fiddly enough. It's it the whole thing is fiddly enough that I can I now understand why apple doesn't ship their own
[21:38.080 --> 21:40.080]  Wireless headphones yet
[21:40.080 --> 21:41.760]  Yeah
[21:41.760 --> 21:43.760]  But it works well with the watch
[21:43.760 --> 21:47.920]  Uh, it did in my testing but in in real life, I don't uh,
[21:48.720 --> 21:54.080]  What I really want to listen to is podcasts right and to listen to podcasts. I still need my phone
[21:54.080 --> 21:59.520]  So i'm still got my phone on my arm, you know while i'm running it's you know, I have it paired with my phone
[22:00.480 --> 22:06.240]  All the 99.9 percent of time I I did pair it to the watch while testing it to see if it worked and it did work
[22:07.200 --> 22:10.800]  But that's really only good for like music that you stick on your on your watch
[22:10.800 --> 22:14.480]  So strange they haven't they didn't launch with podcast support but
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.480]  Priorities, I guess yeah, and you know
[22:19.040 --> 22:22.400]  Who knows who knows what the schedule is for third-party apps?
[22:22.400 --> 22:28.240]  I mean like a watch kit app is never going to be able to do it. Like there's no way you know, like marco can't make overcast
[22:29.440 --> 22:35.200]  Store anything locally on the watch yet, right? It's all you know, watch kit is all stuff that wrote, you know
[22:35.200 --> 22:37.280]  Runs and stores stuff on the phone
[22:37.280 --> 22:41.920]  So the only way that you could get podcasts on it now would be if you put the actual podcast
[22:42.140 --> 22:47.280]  Episodes in your itunes library and then made a playlist in itunes. I mean this sounds like having an ipod in
[22:47.900 --> 22:53.440]  2002 you make a playlist and then you tell your watch that's the playlist I want to sync to but then you're stuck managing your
[22:53.680 --> 22:56.480]  Podcasts by hand like, uh, you know like an animal
[22:58.320 --> 23:00.320]  Yeah, that's not worth it yet
[23:01.200 --> 23:03.200]  No
[23:03.200 --> 23:06.400]  I mean it wouldn't theory would be nice. I would love to go back to it. I would love to go back to it
[23:06.400 --> 23:10.640]  Be nice. I would love to go running without the phone and just have the watch and I don't care about gps
[23:10.720 --> 23:14.640]  So that wouldn't bother me but it's to have the podcast to listen to I still need the phone
[23:17.760 --> 23:19.760]  Cool what else you got
[23:20.480 --> 23:26.400]  Uh correction wise. Oh one more thing and this is like super nerdy. This was last week with uh,
[23:27.200 --> 23:32.480]  With david sparks on the show and I said, uh, this is my mistake not his that rtf
[23:32.480 --> 23:38.000]  You know the rich text format that text edit has long defaulted to I think all the way back to the next
[23:38.320 --> 23:41.120]  days even before next was purchased by by uh,
[23:42.320 --> 23:47.860]  Apple, you know the rich text format and that's a microsoft originated format was sort of cross-platform
[23:49.360 --> 23:52.160]  Styled text, uh, it wasn't supported in ios
[23:52.160 --> 23:56.800]  I said it still isn't supported in ios and I was talking about the complications that people you know, you have if you
[23:57.520 --> 24:00.720]  You if you restore your text in anything but plain text
[24:00.720 --> 24:05.440]  That long term eventually whatever styled text format you have chosen to use
[24:05.920 --> 24:12.240]  Is not going to be supported anymore and it turns out rich text format is in ios as of ios 7
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.400]  Ios 7 added it and i'll put a link in the show notes. There's an nsr
[24:17.200 --> 24:19.040]  at rtf text document type
[24:19.760 --> 24:21.920]  in ios as of ios 7
[24:22.720 --> 24:28.000]  But uh, so it's not even that recent I guess I guess it's two years ago, but I did not know that what?
[24:28.000 --> 24:35.040]  Uh, anyway from ios one through six. There was no rtf support. So I was kind of right what format does the notes app use?
[24:37.600 --> 24:39.680]  Uh, that's a very good question I
[24:40.400 --> 24:41.840]  think
[24:41.840 --> 24:43.840]  That it now uses
[24:44.560 --> 24:46.800]  html under the hood hmm
[24:47.520 --> 24:50.960]  Interesting because I believe it does styling right you can
[24:50.960 --> 24:58.000]  Yeah, they it didn't used to and now it does and I believe it's html. It's some kind of html under the hood
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.520]  But you're not supposed to know that. Yeah interesting. What is vesper use?
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.320]  That's plain text. Oh, that's right. Right then which you know, it was a very deliberate choice on our part. Yeah
[25:09.120 --> 25:11.120]  cool
[25:12.080 --> 25:17.600]  Uh, I think that's it though, I think that now I think i've cleared the deck on corrections and mistakes speaking of those
[25:17.600 --> 25:21.200]  And mistakes speaking of those, uh bluetooth earbuds while I remember
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.360]  I did go into the apple store a few weeks ago and just kind of
[25:25.920 --> 25:31.280]  looking at the options that were out there, uh in case I was going to do an impulse purchase and
[25:32.080 --> 25:39.120]  The the guy there kind of showed me all the different options and that's the one that he recommended but they even those looked a little
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.680]  a little cumbersome
[25:41.680 --> 25:44.240]  Which ones the beats ones the ones that you have?
[25:45.040 --> 25:46.160]  Yeah
[25:46.160 --> 25:50.640]  Do you know what drives me nuts about them? I'll tell it it and it just I know that they didn't make them
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.160]  They're probably designed
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.920]  Before the beats acquisition by apple and I know that they're you know, they're made for any anybody, you know
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.640]  They're not like meant to be paired with an apple product. They're meant to be paired with any product that supports bluetooth
[26:04.080 --> 26:10.720]  But the little clicky thing for plus minus and play pause and that has the microphone on it
[26:10.720 --> 26:15.840]  Is on the left string not the right string and every apple one ever made is on the right string
[26:15.920 --> 26:18.960]  And so I still have the habit where I if I go to pause it while i'm wearing them
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.320]  I reach up with my right hand and I fish around and can't feel it
[26:24.640 --> 26:29.040]  I've experienced the same thing these bows headphones i'm wearing now have it on the left
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.480]  Your uh your phone pod, I guess so whatever you'd call it and it why would you do that?
[26:34.560 --> 26:39.120]  If you're a designer like I I know that you can't just say well apple did it this way so it's a standard
[26:39.120 --> 26:42.640]  But it's a de facto standard because nobody makes more headphones than apple
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.080]  I think apple is probably like the number one headphone maker in the world
[26:46.160 --> 26:51.120]  There's probably more pairs of those white earbuds out there than any other headphone in existence
[26:51.440 --> 26:57.280]  I guess in this case because there is only one cord coming off of them. These are can headphones earbuds
[26:57.360 --> 26:59.360]  I guess by definition you have to have
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.840]  two cords, so
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.400]  Uh, all the earbuds i've seen do it on the right
[27:05.440 --> 27:07.440]  But I don't know
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.440]  Strange
[27:09.760 --> 27:10.640]  Yeah
[27:10.640 --> 27:18.560]  All right. Let me take a break and uh, thank our first sponsor and it's our good friends at squarespace longtime supporters of the show
[27:19.120 --> 27:22.880]  Here's the thing. I I talk about squarespace all the time because they're often sponsored this show
[27:23.120 --> 27:26.080]  best way to think about squarespace is that they are like
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.600]  Next generation. They're like leveling up on hosting your own website
[27:31.600 --> 27:37.040]  like the old-school way of hosting a website is you get some kind of account and then you have a bunch of folders and
[27:37.340 --> 27:40.160]  directories that you sftp in and you
[27:40.880 --> 27:43.040]  Just make all your sites with files
[27:43.600 --> 27:49.440]  And images and throw them up there and and do this now squarespace is so much far beyond that
[27:49.440 --> 27:57.440]  They're not a web host. They are an all-in-one platform and it you start with something that is so much more advanced
[27:57.680 --> 27:59.280]  It's it's like
[27:59.280 --> 28:01.040]  If you're making an app
[28:01.040 --> 28:08.640]  In today's world you start with these incredible frameworks, you know, like cocoa for ios or the android frameworks for android
[28:11.280 --> 28:18.160]  Squarespace is like that for a website you start with this tremendous framework that has all this sort of stuff you need
[28:18.560 --> 28:20.800]  And you're working at such a higher level
[28:21.440 --> 28:23.440]  and it is
[28:23.600 --> 28:25.040]  great
[28:25.040 --> 28:31.760]  for both sides of the expertise fence if you are the sort of person who doesn't know the technical stuff like
[28:32.380 --> 28:35.380]  html syntax how to write javascript how to write css
[28:35.840 --> 28:37.840]  It's great because you can
[28:37.840 --> 28:42.560]  design your own website visually like using an app just looking at it and
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.760]  Making it look the way you think it should look and then that's the way it really is
[28:46.320 --> 28:50.560]  Um, but if you have the technical expertise and i'll bet a lot of people who listen to this show
[28:50.560 --> 28:54.320]  Do and you know how to build your own site by hand with html and stuff like that
[28:55.280 --> 28:57.120]  And you might think well then I don't need squarespace
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.440]  Well, you don't need it, but it could really really just give you a leg up and you can get started. You can be finished
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.280]  in
[29:05.280 --> 29:09.680]  Minutes, maybe but hours even with a lot of tweaking as opposed to days or weeks
[29:10.240 --> 29:13.200]  Because they give you the hooks where if you want to
[29:13.680 --> 29:19.600]  Inject your own javascript into a page because you're using uh, you know some kind of thing that has a javascript
[29:19.600 --> 29:23.360]  thing that has a javascript api you can do that if you want to
[29:24.160 --> 29:27.040]  Tweak the css. You don't want to just use the visual stuff
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.640]  You actually want to get in there and do something specific in the css. You can do that, too
[29:31.120 --> 29:32.080]  so
[29:32.080 --> 29:35.920]  You've got the automatic mode, but you can like switch to manual if you want
[29:36.480 --> 29:43.120]  Really really great stuff and you can just save so much time and be relieved of so many details that you don't need to worry about
[29:43.600 --> 29:45.280]  Everything looks professional
[29:45.280 --> 29:50.960]  So many professionally designed templates to choose from and they're all just starting points where you can tweak them and modify them from there
[29:51.280 --> 29:57.680]  And you can use it to build just about any sort of site you can imagine an online store squarespace has their own commerce stuff
[29:58.480 --> 30:05.360]  A blog you can use it for podcasting. They have their own they even let you host the audio there. Um, they take care of everything
[30:06.160 --> 30:10.640]  Uh, so where do you go to find out more if you have a website to build any kind of idea for a website?

[30:29.760 --> 30:31.760]  Uh build it beautiful
[30:31.840 --> 30:33.760]  That's their new slogan
[30:33.760 --> 30:36.800]  So what's going on? You know, I got yesterday. What's that?
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.120]  I got my uh
[30:39.120 --> 30:41.120]  My personal apple watch. Whoa
[30:41.120 --> 30:46.080]  I got the one that I ordered one minute after they went on sale space black. Uh
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.880]  Link bracelet
[30:48.880 --> 30:50.320]  How do you like it?
[30:50.320 --> 30:53.760]  I I like it a lot. I'm very very happy that I picked this one
[30:54.160 --> 30:56.960]  What band were you wearing with the uh review unit mostly?
[30:57.600 --> 31:00.720]  Uh, mostly the link bracelet. Oh, okay. I didn't know you had one
[31:01.360 --> 31:04.240]  So yeah, I got the what the watch they asked me
[31:05.280 --> 31:09.760]  You know when uh, the you know, like a week before I got the review unit they were you know, they were like
[31:09.760 --> 31:11.520]  Which one do you want?
[31:11.520 --> 31:14.960]  And we're not seeding review units of the edition models
[31:15.840 --> 31:19.600]  So you can have any one you want except for the edition which I would not have asked for anyway
[31:19.600 --> 31:25.760]  Have you seen one yet in the wild? I have I have not not outside the store not either or an apple event
[31:25.760 --> 31:27.440]  I've actually been thinking about writing about that actually
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  Uh, hold that thought hold the thought. All right. All right
[31:34.320 --> 31:37.840]  And I asked for this one I asked for I said well, okay, i'll take the
[31:37.840 --> 31:43.280]  Space black, uh link bracelet and they said, okay, and then uh when I got my review unit there
[31:43.280 --> 31:47.040]  Like we couldn't give you that one. Sorry. And so they gave me the regular link bracelet
[31:48.400 --> 31:50.400]  I you know, I
[31:50.720 --> 31:55.920]  I asked why and they they just gave me that apple like we don't you know, we're not going to tell you why and that was
[31:55.920 --> 31:57.120]  that
[31:57.120 --> 32:00.320]  but my guess, you know just based on the shipping times is that they just
[32:01.120 --> 32:06.480]  Were backlogged production-wise even with the relatively few number that they would need for the review unit
[32:06.480 --> 32:08.480]  But definitely for sure though
[32:08.480 --> 32:14.080]  Even like back at the end of march when I got the review unit. I saw apple employees who were wearing it
[32:14.080 --> 32:18.000]  So there you know people who were within apple have had the black space
[32:18.960 --> 32:21.040]  Space black link bracelet, you know
[32:21.840 --> 32:24.160]  Since march at least if not earlier
[32:24.960 --> 32:30.880]  I saw schiller tweeted a while a couple weeks ago. Somebody asked him on twitter what watch he wears and he has the black
[32:31.600 --> 32:33.440]  link bracelet
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.080]  So I like it a lot. I don't have no idea why it took so long to ship but I guess it you know
[32:38.240 --> 32:43.600]  Whatever the wherever they're producing these things they must have been lower priority than some of the other models
[32:44.240 --> 32:48.720]  And what was the process like kind of shifting over from one watch to the other did?
[32:49.520 --> 32:54.320]  There's not really that much living on the watch. So no, so i've done this before
[32:54.940 --> 32:59.760]  Because I had that bum I had the bum review unit. So I did it like one day in
[32:59.760 --> 33:05.040]  And I forget why I don't know if I was just curious and tinkering but a few weeks later
[33:05.040 --> 33:10.640]  I just reset my watch not because I needed to or had any kind of problem, but just to like I forget why?
[33:11.840 --> 33:13.840]  Oh, I know why
[33:13.840 --> 33:16.000]  Because I wanted to see what it was like
[33:16.720 --> 33:18.720]  To use it with an iphone 5s
[33:19.680 --> 33:26.000]  Instead of a six and so I had to unpair it from my six put my sim card back in my old iphone
[33:26.000 --> 33:31.280]  5s and go through it again. So i've done this a few times. It's actually it it's not too bad
[33:31.520 --> 33:34.400]  But it's kind of a pain in the ass takes about 15
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.120]  to 20 minutes
[33:37.440 --> 33:44.960]  Part of it is that when you unpair it it makes a backup of the watch on the phone and the backup is
[33:46.400 --> 33:47.360]  Not
[33:47.360 --> 33:51.680]  In icloud, it's only on the phone. It's like part of the data
[33:51.680 --> 33:58.000]  of the apple watch app on the phone and so unpairing takes about five minutes and you think why the hell does it take five
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.160]  Minutes to unpair it's because it's doing the backup
[34:00.800 --> 34:06.080]  Then the next time you pair an apple watch whether it's the same one or a different physical thing
[34:06.400 --> 34:11.920]  When you when you go through in the apple watch you have the option to restore from any of your backups
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.520]  I've actually got like I don't know i'm up to like eight backups now and you can't delete those backups
[34:17.520 --> 34:22.960]  Yet, maybe I I I don't know sometime I guess i'll update the app so you can delete them. But um
[34:23.840 --> 34:28.320]  But there's a time stamp on it so you can see, you know, give me the one that I just backed up 10 minutes ago
[34:29.200 --> 34:32.800]  And then it takes like another five 10 minutes for for that to restore
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.040]  There's a few other things though that I always forget to do like I always forget to to set apple pay up again
[34:39.920 --> 34:42.960]  And it makes sense. It makes sense that that doesn't carry over
[34:42.960 --> 34:46.880]  Because it's you know, the secure element things aren't part of the software, you know
[34:46.880 --> 34:50.400]  The the whole point of it being a secure element is that it's you know, a separate storage
[34:50.400 --> 34:54.480]  So you have to every time you do it you have to restart, you know, start apple pay all over again
[34:54.480 --> 35:01.520]  It's also a different card number for each device. Yes, right. It's each device gets a different
[35:02.400 --> 35:08.240]  Unique identifier not just you know, so you can't there's no way that you can just restore from backup and access
[35:08.240 --> 35:17.120]  That come over which is good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. It wouldn't be it wouldn't be secure if it if it worked the other way
[35:17.120 --> 35:19.120]  But it is unfortunately
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.280]  Therefore a little bit less convenient
[35:23.120 --> 35:28.240]  Because I never I actually remembered with this one because I got burned like two or three times with the old one when I reset it
[35:28.240 --> 35:29.920]  But this time I actually remembered to set it again
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.520]  But then you go to like, you know, you go to use apple pay and you sit there and you're double clicking the thing
[35:33.520 --> 35:36.880]  And then you go to like, you know, you go to use apple pay and you sit there and you're double clicking the thing
[35:36.880 --> 35:40.160]  And you sit there and you're double clicking the thing and it's like you haven't set it up yet
[35:40.880 --> 35:47.440]  And you re so you restored your personal watch off of the backup from the test unit and that worked well
[35:47.920 --> 35:49.920]  Yeah, perfectly cool
[35:49.920 --> 35:51.520]  Yeah, I did
[35:51.520 --> 35:56.000]  It's like six and one half a dozen of the other. I don't even know what else I would have lost, you know
[35:56.400 --> 35:58.400]  Your apps are going to come over anyway
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.120]  Because I there just isn't that much I guess, you know, it's that I didn't have to reset, you know
[36:03.120 --> 36:08.260]  Reconfigure all my watch faces, right? Yeah that I I switched to my personal one after
[36:08.820 --> 36:13.220]  I don't know three or four days with the review unit. So I just started from scratch
[36:13.300 --> 36:17.860]  I figured well, I didn't really do anything good those first few days anyway, so
[36:18.740 --> 36:20.740]  I'll just start over
[36:22.020 --> 36:26.500]  But I imagine at this point you've set up enough stuff that you don't want to have to think about it
[36:27.460 --> 36:32.100]  Yeah, more or less but even so I don't have that many watch faces configured and they're not that hard to fiddle with
[36:32.100 --> 36:35.860]  And I play with them and you know, it's I would say of all apple products
[36:36.340 --> 36:41.780]  It's the one where the difference between restoring from backup and starting all over is probably the least
[36:42.580 --> 36:47.700]  You know the least difference do you do you have like a mental algorithm as to where you put different apps?
[36:48.180 --> 36:51.140]  I've spent most of the last seven weeks with them in random places
[36:51.380 --> 36:54.660]  mostly with the ones that I do use the most centered around the
[36:55.220 --> 36:57.380]  Clock face and then let all the other ones be random
[36:57.940 --> 36:58.980]  um
[36:58.980 --> 37:00.980]  I switched to
[37:00.980 --> 37:03.060]  A new system the other day
[37:03.380 --> 37:06.180]  Well, I guess maybe it was when I got this watch and I took some time, you know
[37:06.180 --> 37:09.620]  since it was a new watch it took some time to play with it and
[37:10.340 --> 37:14.980]  Instead of making like a circle around the clock app. I've I've set it up you can
[37:15.700 --> 37:20.100]  It takes some playing with but the way that they stick in that honeycomb pattern
[37:20.820 --> 37:22.260]  I've made like
[37:22.260 --> 37:29.220]  A pyramid on top of the clock app and a separate pyramid below it and then not much to the right or left of the clock
[37:29.220 --> 37:35.160]  App and the ones on top are all third-party apps and the ones down below are the the built-in apps. Ah, interesting
[37:36.100 --> 37:39.880]  I've i've kept the third-party apps toward the outside perimeter
[37:40.340 --> 37:43.880]  But i've tried to keep them as close as possible to their corresponding
[37:45.060 --> 37:50.660]  apple app so I have city mapper next to the maps icon and
[37:51.460 --> 37:54.900]  uh the various running apps that i'm testing next to the
[37:55.700 --> 37:57.700]  main workouts app
[37:57.700 --> 38:01.540]  Uh, but I don't know if and and I also have tried to
[38:02.180 --> 38:03.700]  position them
[38:03.700 --> 38:07.220]  Uh using the same kind of layout as my iphone home screen
[38:07.300 --> 38:13.460]  So overcast is like bottom left or bottom right corner, but I don't know if i'm gonna stick with you know, this is just kind of
[38:14.900 --> 38:16.260]  half random
[38:16.260 --> 38:18.260]  Set up. Yeah
[38:18.260 --> 38:19.060]  um
[38:19.060 --> 38:23.060]  I have to get the bit the next thing I have to do like just busy work on the watch is just
[38:23.540 --> 38:27.300]  I have to delete about 20 of these. Yes. Yeah, like i've had it
[38:27.300 --> 38:31.540]  Set up so that it installs just automatically whenever one of my iphone apps
[38:32.100 --> 38:37.460]  Gets an update with a watch kit component. It just automatically puts it over because i've wanted to be
[38:38.180 --> 38:39.060]  uh
[38:39.060 --> 38:44.180]  You know just show me everything while i'm learning about this platform and experimenting with it
[38:44.580 --> 38:48.260]  but in practice I use so few of them that just having them there just may it just makes for
[38:48.900 --> 38:51.140]  It just makes it harder to find the ones I actually do use
[38:51.860 --> 38:55.300]  Do you sometimes I see the circle kind of filled in?
[38:55.300 --> 39:00.420]  Halfway, like it's doing an update and it just kind of sits like that for a while and I don't know
[39:01.300 --> 39:04.180]  When that happens or why and and how to stop it
[39:04.580 --> 39:10.100]  I've seen that too and what i've found the best thing to do when you get that if you have like a third-party watch
[39:10.660 --> 39:14.580]  That it looks like it's installing but it seems paused, you know
[39:14.580 --> 39:19.380]  It has like you said it has that progress meter over the the icon. Sometimes the icon isn't even there
[39:19.380 --> 39:22.420]  It just has the generic icon. Yeah, I found the best thing to do
[39:22.420 --> 39:25.940]  It's harder if you don't even know what app it is, but go to the phone
[39:26.260 --> 39:29.940]  go to the apple watch app on the phone go to that app and
[39:30.820 --> 39:32.820]  Uninstall it and then reinstall it
[39:33.860 --> 39:39.940]  Oh from the watch fix it from no no from from well from the phone but uninstall it and reinstall it
[39:40.580 --> 39:42.580]  in the watch app not
[39:42.580 --> 39:47.860]  Delete the app off your iphone and then right. Okay, right. Just delete it using the apple watch
[39:47.860 --> 39:52.420]  Yeah, it's so hard to talk about using the apple watch app on the iphone
[39:52.420 --> 39:55.860]  I think what i've been doing is just restarting the watch and that seems to
[39:56.740 --> 40:03.380]  Fix it, but I don't know. Yeah. I wonder if that's one of the problems that they've cleared up with. Oh, yeah 1.01 because
[40:04.180 --> 40:06.180]  Uh, I mean it only came out yesterday
[40:06.500 --> 40:12.340]  Uh, I think or the day before yesterday or the day before maybe so it hasn't been enough time, but I haven't seen it again yet
[40:12.820 --> 40:15.060]  Yeah, I haven't either. I don't think there's much
[40:15.060 --> 40:16.900]  I don't think there's much
[40:16.900 --> 40:18.340]  user facing
[40:18.340 --> 40:20.020]  stuff in that update
[40:20.020 --> 40:25.780]  No, I don't think so either except for the emoji. Oh, yeah true and the new language support. They did add a bunch of languages
[40:27.380 --> 40:28.740]  That's good
[40:28.740 --> 40:29.780]  Yeah
[40:29.780 --> 40:31.860]  Um, so which which watch are you wearing?
[40:31.940 --> 40:37.540]  Uh, i'll tell you one second when you when you I don't know if we're allowed to talk about this when you received your review unit
[40:38.500 --> 40:39.540]  uh
[40:39.540 --> 40:41.540]  was there some sort of like
[40:41.540 --> 40:47.620]  Space with that you went to or something like that. Was there like a meeting place that you went to?
[40:48.260 --> 40:51.860]  Yeah, I think technically i'm not supposed to talk about it. All right, let's not talk about it
[40:51.860 --> 40:57.780]  Yeah, but you go there but you know, I but I just like any other product I've I have personally never once
[40:58.500 --> 41:02.020]  Received any review unit from apple that wasn't accompanied
[41:02.580 --> 41:08.180]  By a briefing where you talk to somebody from apple and they you know, and it sounds annoying but they they
[41:08.180 --> 41:15.780]  In my experience also, they're also very respectful of your time and patience and they don't really waste your time
[41:16.180 --> 41:19.780]  But they definitely don't they don't just give you a box. They certainly don't ship them to you
[41:20.820 --> 41:24.820]  You know, they just sort of run you through some basics no matter what the product is
[41:26.260 --> 41:30.420]  And so yeah, I had to go I went to new york and had a briefing there. All right, I
[41:33.220 --> 41:35.620]  I guess I don't know if i'm allowed to talk about this either
[41:35.620 --> 41:39.220]  But let's i'm going to say something because why not because it was cool. Uh,
[41:40.020 --> 41:44.820]  I I got mine after you got yours and I think I think someone else I think philip elmer de witt
[41:44.820 --> 41:48.420]  Was at the same kind of wave that I was in and I think he wrote about it
[41:48.980 --> 41:57.060]  In a in a somewhat cranky amusing way. Um, but was what was interesting is that at uh, the thing I attended
[41:57.620 --> 42:01.380]  Apple had brought in their two tables full of watches to
[42:01.380 --> 42:06.180]  Give you a demo of
[42:06.180 --> 42:09.540]  To and this is not at an apple store. This was at a you know
[42:10.580 --> 42:15.940]  at a totally different place and they had brought in those huge watch displays and
[42:16.420 --> 42:22.100]  Completely unnecessarily and I thought it was pretty pretty interesting and kind of unique that they did that
[42:22.740 --> 42:26.580]  Yeah, they had the same thing at uh from all right. All right. Well, never mind at the end of march
[42:26.820 --> 42:28.820]  Well, the funny thing is so years ago
[42:28.820 --> 42:30.820]  Uh
[42:31.220 --> 42:36.980]  When was that when the when they first they had a they had a briefing for mac os 10 and I
[42:38.260 --> 42:40.260]  Wrote about it at daring fireball
[42:42.020 --> 42:46.820]  Oh, right when where I met with shiller at the yes, yes couple of product, you know
[42:46.900 --> 42:50.500]  So a couple other guys from his product marketing team and some people from pr
[42:51.140 --> 42:54.660]  Uh, and I just wrote about the actual experience of the briefing
[42:54.660 --> 43:00.020]  Um, and I had asked I you know, they were and it was the whole idea was they were giving us access to
[43:00.420 --> 43:04.420]  Mac os 10 10.8. I think was it 10.8
[43:07.700 --> 43:09.700]  Let me see when was that
[43:09.940 --> 43:15.780]  But it was like they they had been on a schedule where mac os 10 was getting updated every two years and they wanted to get
[43:15.780 --> 43:17.300]  back on
[43:17.300 --> 43:20.740]  Like an every year schedule and it was a surprise and they said, you know
[43:20.740 --> 43:26.180]  do you want to come meet in new york and they didn't even tell me what it was and it turned out if we were getting
[43:26.180 --> 43:28.180]  a pre-release version of uh
[43:29.380 --> 43:31.780]  Uh, you know an upcoming version of mac os 10
[43:34.020 --> 43:38.740]  Uh, and I asked you know, and they were like, you know, and I was like was this on the record or off the record?
[43:38.740 --> 43:40.500]  Like it's on the record, you know, you can write about it
[43:40.500 --> 43:45.060]  You know, we want you we want to start getting you know, we want you guys to use this they gave us
[43:45.940 --> 43:49.060]  Like macbook airs or macbook pros. I forget which pre-loaded with it
[43:49.060 --> 43:52.900]  So we didn't have to put a beta on our regular machines
[43:53.620 --> 43:55.620]  um
[43:55.700 --> 43:59.540]  And they were like it's on the record you can talk about this, uh, you know what you learn but
[44:00.020 --> 44:05.220]  They did not anticipate me going meta and writing about the actual briefing as opposed to
[44:05.700 --> 44:10.180]  What was said about the thing and they weren't I was wasn't I didn't get like a nasty gram or anything
[44:10.260 --> 44:16.980]  but then every other briefing since they've always reminded me that they've changed they've changed the language of the
[44:16.980 --> 44:18.740]  The
[44:18.740 --> 44:22.020]  What's on the record and what's off the record such that writing about the event, you know
[44:22.020 --> 44:24.420]  The breathing itself is actually you're not supposed to
[44:25.060 --> 44:26.020]  well
[44:26.020 --> 44:32.260]  Here they're called it that they've called it the john gruber clause. Well, here's the uh, here's the fortune article by uh,
[44:32.580 --> 44:34.580]  elmer de wit that uh
[44:34.900 --> 44:36.900]  That'll be the the new clause
[44:38.260 --> 44:40.020]  I just see
[44:40.020 --> 44:43.940]  There he is, uh trying it. Oh photo credit apple pr
[44:43.940 --> 44:45.940]  Awesome
[44:47.220 --> 44:53.860]  Anyway, I I just thought that was an interesting example of going above, uh above what's necessary to uh,
[44:55.220 --> 45:00.500]  To do something in a cool way and maybe we'll have to edit this whole thing out. I don't know. No, I think it's all right
[45:00.900 --> 45:03.460]  So anyway, so you asked me what i'm watch what i'm wearing
[45:04.740 --> 45:06.740]  and it's the uh
[45:06.820 --> 45:08.820]  the blue sport
[45:09.700 --> 45:11.700]  Version
[45:11.700 --> 45:18.660]  Which is my the one I personally ordered and uh, and I love it. I I tried out the you know, the main watch
[45:19.540 --> 45:26.660]  uh, and they and I got the milanese loop and the green sport band, which is not uh,
[45:28.260 --> 45:34.340]  Doesn't look as great. I think the blue one looks really good. I've been I've really enjoyed it. Um, it's I I noticed the
[45:34.980 --> 45:37.220]  Weight difference between this one and the main one
[45:37.220 --> 45:41.300]  And I actually prefer the lighter one. I'm not you know, it's not even for
[45:42.500 --> 45:47.140]  I'm not like going out and running with it all the time. I just kind of like the the lighter thing
[45:47.140 --> 45:49.620]  But I also have never in my life owned
[45:50.340 --> 45:55.620]  A heavy kind of dude watch or anything like that. Yeah, the last watch I wore
[45:56.420 --> 45:58.420]  Uh was a casio
[45:58.660 --> 46:00.020]  calculator watch
[46:00.020 --> 46:01.700]  unironically
[46:01.700 --> 46:03.940]  In middle school or something like that
[46:03.940 --> 46:08.980]  I think anybody would get used to any weight watch the gold one might always be feel a little heavy
[46:08.980 --> 46:13.540]  But only in a way that I think you'd want a gold watch to feel heavy like you kind of don't want to forget
[46:13.540 --> 46:15.540]  That you're wearing a gold watch
[46:15.540 --> 46:19.380]  But I as someone who's worn a heavy-ish stainless steel watch for a couple of years
[46:20.020 --> 46:24.980]  I found it a little bit hard to get used to at first but it it quickly you you acclimate
[46:25.940 --> 46:31.620]  I noticed it most with i i've tried just just experimenting with apple watch i've tried
[46:31.620 --> 46:37.060]  Wearing it on my right wrist just to see what left-handed mode is like and when I put it on my other wrist
[46:37.060 --> 46:38.820]  I was like, holy crap. This is heavy
[46:38.820 --> 46:42.180]  But it's funny because my left wrist is so used to wearing a watch that I never noticed it
[46:42.180 --> 46:46.740]  But for people who haven't been wearing a watch the last few years I can totally see how the first impression
[46:47.220 --> 46:52.660]  Would be I like the sport watch because this feels this doesn't feel like i've got something weighing my wrist down
[46:53.620 --> 46:55.620]  Yeah, it's I mean it's not a huge difference
[46:55.620 --> 47:02.020]  It's I mean, it's not a huge difference. Uh, and and actually the milanase loop is lighter than the sport band
[47:02.580 --> 47:04.820]  So the all-in weight is almost the same
[47:05.460 --> 47:07.700]  But it just kind of uh distributed more
[47:08.420 --> 47:10.420]  more evenly
[47:10.660 --> 47:12.020]  Anyway
[47:12.020 --> 47:16.420]  The thing I like here so just to go back to this the space black my my day
[47:16.900 --> 47:20.980]  You know 24 hours with an impression is it's exactly what I thought it was going to be like when I bought it
[47:21.460 --> 47:23.940]  Which is that it just looks like one
[47:23.940 --> 47:27.940]  Shiny black object on my wrist, especially when the screen is off
[47:30.100 --> 47:36.100]  It doesn't look like a shiny device with a black display it just looks like a black thing on my wrist
[47:36.820 --> 47:40.260]  And then when it lights up and it's like on the watch face it to me
[47:40.260 --> 47:44.900]  It looks really cool that the you know, it's just the only thing you really see are the pixels of the watch face
[47:45.860 --> 47:51.460]  Like it it now it's not that you can't see the edge between the sapphire and the the stainless steel
[47:51.460 --> 47:54.980]  But at a glance you can't it's all just shiny and black
[47:55.540 --> 47:58.820]  It's a very it's a very cool effect in my opinion. Yeah, I think that's a good look
[47:59.460 --> 48:04.340]  The this this the I don't know what you'd call it aluminum, uh sport
[48:05.300 --> 48:12.580]  Definitely when it's off kind of has a distinct look to it. It's very bright and it attracts a lot of light. So
[48:13.300 --> 48:15.860]  It's I don't think this will age well
[48:15.860 --> 48:22.980]  And one of the reasons I got the cheaper one is because I figure i'll be upgrading this probably every generation for the foreseeable future. So
[48:25.140 --> 48:27.140]  You know
[48:27.300 --> 48:34.020]  Budget but uh, it definitely sticks out the other thing I noticed and i'm curious to see because I know like the the
[48:35.620 --> 48:38.180]  The space black ones only started shipping a few days ago
[48:38.180 --> 48:42.340]  like I didn't get the first one, but I don't think anybody got one more than like like
[48:42.340 --> 48:50.340]  Three or four days before me. Um, and a friend of the show everybody internet sweetheart renee richie was waiting for one, too
[48:50.340 --> 48:55.140]  I think he and his seemed to ship at the same time mine did but because his was going to canada
[48:55.140 --> 48:58.980]  He probably didn't get it till today, but i'll bet I haven't looked at twitter today. I'll bet he's got it
[49:00.580 --> 49:03.380]  i'm really curious to see if other people have this problem too is
[49:05.140 --> 49:09.780]  I when I tried to take the band off the bracelet off it was a
[49:09.780 --> 49:13.780]  I on at first I thought it was stuck like I you know, and i'm used to taking it on and off
[49:13.780 --> 49:16.580]  I've swatched swapped the band on my review unit
[49:17.380 --> 49:22.100]  Dozens of times over the last six weeks and even right from day one never really had a problem with it
[49:22.340 --> 49:27.300]  You click those little release buttons slide it out and it just goes out with this space black one
[49:27.300 --> 49:35.860]  i'd click the button and the button definitely went in and the bracelet just did not budge in that slot just didn't budge and
[49:35.860 --> 49:41.460]  At first I thought hmm and then I I really started to think maybe this is you know, i've got another problem here
[49:42.500 --> 49:47.220]  So then I put it down on a table and I really pressed the button hard and I really put a little bit more
[49:47.220 --> 49:51.140]  Force than I was comfortable exerting to slide the band out
[49:51.860 --> 49:56.340]  And it nudged a little bit and then once I got it going a little bit I could get it out
[49:56.900 --> 50:01.940]  But more or less it just felt like there was a lot of friction and it was a very tight fit
[50:01.940 --> 50:06.500]  Uh, and then after I got both halves out once
[50:07.140 --> 50:10.580]  It never was that difficult to get you know to do it again
[50:10.580 --> 50:15.940]  But it still even after doing it a few times has an amount of friction that is unlike
[50:16.980 --> 50:18.980]  The review unit one
[50:19.700 --> 50:21.540]  So I talked to uh, what's his name?
[50:21.540 --> 50:27.140]  Greg konig the guy the the guy who has all these in crazy cool insights into
[50:27.140 --> 50:34.180]  The metallurgy of the apple watch, you know that he wrote that uh, amazing post about you know, what apple's doing with metal
[50:35.620 --> 50:37.620]  You know the guy i'm talking about on twitter yeah
[50:38.820 --> 50:45.860]  So I asked him about it and he said like I was like, so do you think this dlc coding would that increase friction?
[50:45.860 --> 50:47.860]  And he was like no the opposite
[50:48.660 --> 50:52.340]  You know a lot of like high-end machine tools are used at dlc
[50:52.340 --> 50:59.940]  Coding to decrease friction. Um, so it's not the dlc coding his theory and it probably makes sense to me
[51:00.580 --> 51:08.100]  Is that I just happen to get like a bracelet that you know within their tolerances, which are crazy small
[51:08.740 --> 51:15.380]  Has a slightly thicker, you know lugs on the bracelet that slide in and I got a watch with slightly
[51:15.380 --> 51:22.500]  Thinner diameter slot and it just happened, you know both are within range but because the slot's a little tighter
[51:22.580 --> 51:24.580]  And the bracelet's a little thicker
[51:24.980 --> 51:28.020]  It just makes for a tighter fit and that it's sort of inevitable
[51:28.420 --> 51:33.060]  At manufacturing things at the scale that apple is that you know, you run into something like this
[51:34.020 --> 51:40.180]  Whereas like if you were buying a thousand dollar watch from rolex, you know, you're buying a thousand dollar watch
[51:40.180 --> 51:45.940]  From rolex, you'd never run into this because everything is done by hand and it's they're not doing you know, a million units a month
[51:46.660 --> 51:52.660]  Yeah, and you got to assume it. Well, I don't know but I would assume that over time it'll loosen up a bit
[51:52.660 --> 51:56.420]  But I don't know. Yeah, it's definitely loosened up from the first time I took it off like
[51:57.140 --> 52:00.900]  And it really does and I assume some of this stuff is not done by robots
[52:00.900 --> 52:04.660]  I mean whenever you see behind the scenes stuff in apple's assembly places
[52:04.660 --> 52:09.460]  I mean, it seems like everything is done by hand and it's definitely loosened up from the first time I took it off
[52:09.460 --> 52:13.620]  I mean, it seems like everything's done by hand really or almost everything, you know, and then
[52:14.260 --> 52:19.460]  Um, I just presume that somebody there had to put the bracelet on the watch and could tell that it was tight
[52:19.540 --> 52:21.140]  But let it slide
[52:21.140 --> 52:25.220]  I mean and again, it's not dysfunctional and once I did it once it was easier to get it on and off
[52:25.300 --> 52:27.300]  But i'm curious to see
[52:28.260 --> 52:30.260]  It just seems like we're seeing so many
[52:30.740 --> 52:34.260]  Little things that affect a small number of people with the watch, you know
[52:34.260 --> 52:38.500]  And i'm curious to see if this is one of them once the space black ships to more people
[52:38.980 --> 52:42.340]  well that kind of helps explain some of the uh,
[52:43.380 --> 52:44.820]  quantity
[52:44.820 --> 52:45.940]  issues
[52:45.940 --> 52:50.100]  Yeah, I definitely think so. I mean, I mean it's the first time they're making this thing. So
[52:50.740 --> 52:52.740]  Sure, of course, there's going to be
[52:52.980 --> 52:55.300]  And they're all different. So there's going to be
[52:56.180 --> 53:00.500]  Some stuff here and there for removing the links from the bracelet, you know
[53:00.500 --> 53:05.140]  But the way you take the links out to resize it it was easy as pie just as easy as it was with the
[53:05.460 --> 53:12.420]  The regular stainless steel one I had as a review unit. That was easy. It was only taking the bracelet, uh out of the slot
[53:13.700 --> 53:18.820]  That's interesting that the coating makes it have less friction because I would not have guessed it
[53:19.140 --> 53:24.580]  Yeah, it i'll tell you what the other thing too before we move on i'll just say it does feel weird to the touch
[53:24.820 --> 53:27.220]  like not weird in a bad way, but like
[53:27.220 --> 53:30.420]  If I close my eyes and just run my finger over the side of the watch
[53:31.220 --> 53:38.340]  It doesn't really feel like metal to me. It doesn't feel like steel, but it doesn't feel like plastic or rubber. It feels like
[53:39.220 --> 53:44.100]  I I don't know like I I think if I was really honest and I didn't know what it was and I was blindfolded
[53:44.660 --> 53:49.220]  And you said what substance is this? I'm not sure i'd be able to guess it's a very strange
[53:50.020 --> 53:56.740]  Feeling not in any way unpleasant. It's nice. It feels very nice to the touch, but it doesn't feel like metal to me
[53:56.740 --> 54:02.820]  But it doesn't feel like steel. Whereas if I touch the other apple watch the review unit you can instantly tell this feels like steel
[54:03.700 --> 54:06.340]  is it that it's less porous or
[54:07.380 --> 54:09.860]  yeah, it's it's a little bit it's like
[54:10.580 --> 54:16.020]  It feels sort of like a plastic coating on steel. Yeah, but the plastic's the wrong word though
[54:16.340 --> 54:20.740]  But I mean plastic only in that it feels smoother. It feels less porous. It feels
[54:20.740 --> 54:26.500]  Like perfectly polished. That's cool. I'll have to try one out. I haven't I kind of skipped that one during the
[54:27.140 --> 54:31.780]  Try on session. Yeah, I definitely and I recommend if anybody does get you know
[54:31.780 --> 54:35.540]  Some hands on time with one just feel it don't just look at it. But like actually feel it
[54:36.340 --> 54:39.380]  What color is the accent on the crown? Is it black also?
[54:40.100 --> 54:42.420]  It is black. Oh cool. Everything is black. Yeah
[54:43.620 --> 54:46.180]  It is there is a sort of darth vader ish
[54:46.980 --> 54:48.980]  Aesthetic to it
[54:48.980 --> 54:54.180]  Uh, do you do you go for a different face with the black one than the silver one?
[54:54.660 --> 54:57.380]  No sound activity with the orange second hand
[54:58.420 --> 54:59.540]  cool
[54:59.540 --> 55:06.900]  I see now that the you know, I don't know so maybe it was on twitter or somewhere where you were trashing the color face, but
[55:07.780 --> 55:13.300]  Uh, it actually looks great when you have a colored band. Oh, I didn't want to trash. No, I know i'm just kidding
[55:14.020 --> 55:17.620]  Actually, there's something very annoying about the color face. So if we have some swing here
[55:17.620 --> 55:20.180]  Let's talk about it there. Uh, I I uh,
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.180]  Well, hold that thought let's do a sponsor read and then we'll know we'll know where we're coming back to when we come back
[55:24.180 --> 55:30.020]  We'll bitch about the color face. Uh, let me take a break here and tell you about our next sponsor another long time
[55:30.580 --> 55:33.460]  Friend of the show our good friends at fracture
[55:34.580 --> 55:41.460]  Fracture is is the service where you send your photos to them. They print it directly on glass
[55:41.460 --> 55:48.500]  Glass your size whatever size frame you want anything from a little five by five square
[55:49.060 --> 55:52.580]  Up to a giant like 23 by 29 inch thing. You can hang on a wall
[55:54.960 --> 55:56.960]  Amazingly to me it's amazing to me
[55:57.540 --> 56:01.060]  With you know with all the talk about megapixels and how they don't really matter etc, etc
[56:01.060 --> 56:06.580]  But that you can take like photos with your iphone and print them on like a 23 by 29 thing and it looks great
[56:06.660 --> 56:08.660]  And it doesn't look pixelated at all
[56:08.660 --> 56:13.540]  Uh, you can totally do that all sorts of sizes really great service
[56:14.660 --> 56:20.820]  And just amazing results. They print this stuff right on the glass and it looks like it's right on the surface now
[56:21.220 --> 56:23.540]  Really what they do the printing is on the bottom
[56:23.780 --> 56:28.420]  So like it's not going to scratch off or anything like that with what you expose like if you hang it on a wall
[56:28.900 --> 56:31.620]  The printing isn't on top of the glass. It's on the bottom of the glass
[56:31.860 --> 56:37.540]  But because it's just this thin layer of glass the effect is is exactly like, you know
[56:37.540 --> 56:43.460]  The effect of like the the display being laminated to the glass on an iphone. It just looks like the
[56:44.340 --> 56:46.340]  Like the picture is on glass
[56:47.940 --> 56:52.020]  I've said this so many times but i'm telling you you get a couple of these you hang them up on the wall
[56:52.180 --> 56:55.940]  And when people come into your house, they say whoa, what is that? How did you do that?
[56:56.100 --> 56:59.140]  How is that possible because it doesn't look like any other
[56:59.780 --> 57:00.740]  our
[57:00.740 --> 57:08.100]  Picture hanging on your wall. There's no bezel around the side. It's edge to edge and it really clearly does not look like a piece of
[57:08.180 --> 57:13.380]  Paper with the photo on it behind glass. It really does look like it's right on the surface
[57:14.100 --> 57:16.100]  It's such a great effect
[57:16.580 --> 57:19.060]  Father's day is coming up. It is a tremendous gift idea
[57:20.180 --> 57:24.660]  For anybody in your family can't can't go wrong with fracture as a gift idea
[57:25.300 --> 57:27.140]  So where do you go?
[57:27.140 --> 57:28.740]  to find out more
[57:28.740 --> 57:30.740]  go to fracture me
[57:31.140 --> 57:34.820]  dot com and use the code when you check out daring fireball
[57:35.540 --> 57:37.540]  And that will save you
[57:37.940 --> 57:39.940]  uh 15 on your order
[57:41.140 --> 57:44.020]  So my thanks to fracture go there. I know I talk about them every week
[57:44.020 --> 57:46.420]  But they keep sponsoring because you guys keep buying the pictures
[57:46.420 --> 57:49.700]  So keep buying pictures and if you haven't done it yet check them out. You're nuts if you don't
[57:51.460 --> 57:57.780]  So you want to talk speaking of color photos we can talk about the color color face looks great with the uh color sport band
[57:57.780 --> 57:58.820]  I love it
[57:58.820 --> 58:03.240]  uh, but it's there, you know, and every watch face has different complications
[58:04.420 --> 58:05.460]  and
[58:05.460 --> 58:10.820]  Uh because I have not owned a watch in so long. I can't tell time
[58:11.700 --> 58:14.900]  So I keep the digital time in one of the corners
[58:15.940 --> 58:17.700]  um
[58:17.700 --> 58:21.220]  Sorry, kind of embarrassing. It is a little embarrassing. I know
[58:21.620 --> 58:22.740]  um
[58:22.740 --> 58:25.540]  But you know why you know, what actually is the main reason is that?
[58:25.540 --> 58:32.180]  The watch uh has sleeves have not been a problem like the watch fits pretty nicely under my shirt sleeves
[58:32.580 --> 58:38.180]  But it kind of parks itself in a way that if I stretch my arm out, I can't really see the whole watch
[58:38.740 --> 58:44.900]  Very easily like yeah, I kind of have to fiddle with it. So in the bottom right corner, I keep the digital time
[58:46.340 --> 58:48.340]  But there is no digital time
[58:48.740 --> 58:54.100]  Function complication in the color face. So you have to use world clock
[58:54.100 --> 58:55.860]  world clock
[58:55.860 --> 58:57.460]  um, right
[58:57.460 --> 59:01.300]  so you have to keep your city and I guess I don't know what the
[59:02.180 --> 59:04.020]  details are but when I
[59:04.020 --> 59:10.420]  essentially when I leave when I switch cities, I have to change the time manually the city manually to
[59:11.140 --> 59:16.100]  Have the have the current time there, which is fine. I don't you know, it's not like i'm traveling all the time. But
[59:16.820 --> 59:19.320]  Uh, so but now it always says nyc
[59:20.020 --> 59:22.020]  with the local time
[59:22.020 --> 59:24.660]  In the corner, so friend of the show
[59:25.860 --> 59:30.260]  Dave whiskus editor of the show as a matter of fact, uh, he came up with a clever
[59:31.060 --> 59:32.180]  um
[59:32.180 --> 59:33.940]  hack on that
[59:33.940 --> 59:39.560]  So with the color face, you can also one of the uh, it's the only one where you can have the monogram
[59:40.500 --> 59:42.500]  um
[59:42.560 --> 59:44.020]  Complication
[59:44.020 --> 59:50.260]  It is the color face with the monogram, right? I don't think so. I think that's uh, let me customize it. Nope
[59:50.260 --> 59:56.100]  Oh, wait, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you can set a monogram on the phone in the apple watch app
[59:56.420 --> 01:00:01.300]  There's somewhere in the settings and you set a monogram. You only get up to four characters. I think
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.380]  Uh, you have four characters to play with and you could just put your initials in there
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:10.420]  Anything up to four characters and then it puts it like underneath the 12, you know
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:17.060]  Like where the logo usually goes on a on a watch so I figured out you can't put emoji in there, but you there are
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:23.220]  Those I don't even know what you call them. But those unifold unicode characters that are pictures but aren't emoji because they're black and white
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.300]  and um
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:29.140]  There's the one that's the apple logo, you know, I think you can get by typing
[01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.180]  Shift command option shift k yeah option shift k on a mac
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.540]  So there's no way to get that on ios
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.820]  But if you get it type it on your mac with option shift k you can like text it to yourself and then copy it from
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:48.020]  the text and then paste it into the monogram thing and then you can have a little apple logo
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.700]  On the color face underneath the 12 o'clock
[01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:58.580]  Which is a neat little trick but to me it renders a little too small it's it's like the size isn't right
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.180]  Whisk has had the idea though, uh, because I think he does the same thing you do where he wants the digital time
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.260]  Even with an analog face is you can also name
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:14.260]  Custom custom names for the time zones. So like if like let's say you live in philadelphia
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:19.380]  If you don't want it to say nyc for your home time, you can make it say phl or whatever
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:25.380]  Or whatever your hometown is in your time zone so you could name the time zone with the apple logo
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.140]  And then you just have a little apple logo and the digital time up in the corner
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:36.020]  Which is a pretty neat trick if you want the digital time, but don't want to have stupid nyc or you know
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.020]  Sf or something like that up there, too
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.900]  Yeah, although when I so so then when I was in california last week or two weeks ago
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.740]  I switched it from san francisco to la once I landed in la
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:53.060]  And but it was kind of cool. It's like yep. Now i'm in la and my watch is telling me that so I don't maybe it's a
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.060]  Feature and not a bug
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.780]  For the u.s. At least I well again this is why they let you customize it is to me
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.020]  I guess i'd rather just have the time zone like
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:06.500]  You know, I just eastern daylight time or pacific daylight time or something like that
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.980]  But I get you know for like worldwide. I don't really think I don't even know what the name of the time zone is for
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:17.300]  Paris or something like that. I just you know, I want the city but I think it's pulling in the city from your world clock
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:22.260]  Settings, which I think is across ios. Yes, so you go to the
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.980]  You go to the clock app in
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.660]  I think I don't know who knows yeah, I don't know who knows
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.580]  Who knows? Yeah, who knows how you do play around messing around with that?
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.940]  Honestly, like this is some of the most fun i've had that was messing around with this thing. Yeah, I totally agree
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.380]  uh, you know people all the time are asking me should I should I get one and
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:50.180]  I would say the entertainment value is has paid at least paid for half of it so far
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.020]  I've had a breakthrough i've been trying to write about the um, and as we record
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.300]  I think this is one of those things famous last words because sometimes I get I get backed up and I don't get stuff out
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:01.620]  the door
[01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.820]  but I think
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:09.060]  That the article i'm talking about writing will be published on daring fireball before this episode of the podcast airs
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.820]  So i'm going to talk about it in the past tense. So that's what you've been up to
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.220]  I've been trying to write about the interact. It's not super long
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.660]  It shouldn't be a super long article
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.780]  But i've been struggling to write about this ever since my initial apple
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.100]  Watch review and I said hey, I didn't even write about the software here, but i'll write about it later
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.500]  And I still haven't written of it and it's because i've it's not because i've been lazy
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:32.420]  It's because i've really been struggling to just get it that i've felt like
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.060]  There is something to get
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.700]  That i'm close to getting
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.860]  But that I couldn't quite get
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.460]  until uh
[01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.220]  two days ago
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.300]  And steven berlin johnson wrote a piece on medium. Um
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:52.900]  Kind of complaining about the behavior of the digital crown button that he thinks it does too much that it should be
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:56.580]  You know, like on the iphone you hit the home button and no matter where you are. It takes you home
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.300]  And then like the one other thing it does
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:07.540]  Is if you're like on a not first home screen and you hit it it takes you to your first home screen
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.380]  But no matter where else you are tap that button once always takes you home
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.140]  So his idea was that he thinks that it's like the digital crown
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.940]  It sounds complicated because if you're like on a watch face
[01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.260]  it takes you to your home screen where your apps are and if
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.980]  You're on the home screen with the apps
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:31.220]  And you press it if the clock is centered
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.140]  It'll take you back to your watch face. And if the clock isn't centered
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.900]  It'll center on your clock face and then you can tap it again and it'll take you to your watch face
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:44.740]  And if you're in an app, it'll take you back to the list of apps and that he thinks that's
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:50.340]  It's like too much and that every time you tap the digital crown just once it should just take you back to your watch face
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.020]  And I totally understand how what he was his arguing
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.820]  is simpler
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:04.660]  But I feel like it misses it helped me centralize my my understanding of the watch interaction design and I think what he's missing
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:11.700]  Is that the biggest difference between the watch and ios and any other thing i've ever used is that there's really two modes
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.420]  To the watch there's watch face mode
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:22.580]  And app mode and app mode for lack of and these are my terms not apples app mode is pretty much everything else like
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.140]  when watch face mode to me
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:31.140]  Is the primary mode of the watch and watch face mode is it shows a watch face?
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:36.100]  You slide down for notifications you slide up for glances
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:41.860]  And from a glance you can launch the corresponding app
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.300]  And all that time
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.420]  you're
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.420]  You're just you stay in
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.500]  watch face mode
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500]  Not not at watch face mode
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.940]  So like when you're in a glances you hit that home button
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:06:00.360]  It just takes you back to your watch face because you're still in watch face mode if you pull down notifications
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.940]  You hit the digital crown button just takes you back to your watch face
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.940]  uh
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.620]  The other thing the digital crown button does is it lets you switch between the two modes
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.860]  So that's you know, that's the two functions of the digital crown button
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.860]  One is while you're within either one of those modes. It just takes you back to the default place for that mode
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.140]  Which for watch face mode is your watch face?
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.820]  And which for app mode is the list of apps?
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:35.300]  And then you can you know, then you hit it again and you toggle between the two
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:41.220]  Hopefully this will make a lot more sense in my article but that to me is the big breakthrough and i'm
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:46.820]  Very clear to me the more I think about it that this is the way the watch interaction model works and the biggest tell
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.060]  Is that when you're using an app, like let's say you're using overcast. That's an app that I use a lot
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.420]  Great app
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:03.380]  It's really a great app really really is. I mean he nailed it the first version and then he re-nailed it the second version
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:10.100]  Yeah, I totally agree and it's and it's amazing that apple isn't even doesn't even seem to have any
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.140]  Podcast anything on the horizon. So
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.860]  Yeah, well, I don't think so
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.980]  If i'm in overcast
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.540]  And I hit the digital crown button once
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:24.820]  Two different things can happen
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:30.100]  I'll either go back to the list of apps that you can pan around or i'll go back to my watch face
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.640]  And the difference is how did I get to overcast?
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.740]  If you launch it from the glance
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.220]  You hit the home button to just go back to the glance
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.740]  Right. I don't know if I have the glance installed
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:51.860]  I haven't been using glances really only for like heart rate. I you should try here. I have the
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.700]  To me getting used to using you you hit it once to go back to the watch face
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.780]  So you go from watch face to a glance any glance go to the weather one go to any glance
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.900]  Oh, if you tap tap the glance to launch the app when you tap the digital crown button
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:08.100]  You go back to the watch face because you haven't switched modes
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:12.180]  You're still in watch face mode and you've only used the glance as like a launcher
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:18.660]  If you launch the app from the list of apps when you hit the digital crown you go back to the list of apps
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:23.380]  You go back to which one you are. You have to still hit the digital crown once more to switch to the other mode
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.420]  And then the other thing that you never have to worry about at least in the default
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.140]  Configuration which I really do think is right for everybody is at any point
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:38.340]  You can just put your wrist down and stop paying attention to the watch and 30 seconds later
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.780]  You just get put back into watch mode so that when you look at your watch the next time it's just showing the watch face
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:50.100]  With exceptions for things like the workout app or the remote app which if you're using them
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.820]  Stay there because they assume that you know
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:56.500]  If you're using your watch to control your tv or if you're doing a workout
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:00.820]  You want to have it default to that until you're done with the whatever it is you're doing
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:06.900]  So it's almost like there's two different hierarchies of of interface. Yes, exactly
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.220]  And my my guess is that the watch face
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:14.660]  Trunk, or whatever you would call it probably gets the most
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:16.900]  Time
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.220]  Yes, I certainly the quickest I guess
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:25.220]  I almost think of the and I this sounds denigrating but I don't mean it that way
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:31.300]  I almost think of the app mode as sort of like a junk drawer like like the watch world is
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:38.180]  So neatly organized you've got these limited number of faces to choose from with the complications that you can play with and again
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:42.340]  I i'm with you. I think it's a lot of fun to play with them. I i'm still doing it eight weeks later
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.740]  Notifications from the top
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:52.580]  And the glances from the bottom if I tell you if you haven't tried you try using glances organize them in a way
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.580]  That seems useful to you
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:59.220]  I just like the icon screen so much like I almost want to look at that more
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.700]  And I I I do always pick the wrong app, but whatever I've gotten better at it
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:12.100]  Yeah, I find a little better too. I find like they're picking the apps off that little screen. It it looks it's like candy, you know
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:17.780]  Yeah, I find that if you try to tap the top of the app, I I i'm more accurate
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.660]  I wonder if the uh, the the
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:26.180]  Whatever you would call it the algorithm it uses to
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:33.700]  Figure out where you're trying to touch is different on the watch than it is on the on the iphone or ipad
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:39.620]  I'm convinced that it is. Yeah convinced and it makes it have you ever tried using it not on your wrist
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:45.060]  Like take the watch. Yes, like when i'm giving a demo to someone and I want to type in my passcode
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:48.100]  It never works, right? It is impossible to tap them correctly
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:54.760]  I feel like they have corrected for the parallax of the angle that you're at, you know, it's it's completely optimized
[01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.460]  For being on your wrist at the distance where you would you know?
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:03.380]  Keep it from your eyes to poke at it with your other hand index finger
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:11.540]  Yeah, i'm convinced that they're that they went through and I think they even I think they even changed the parallax to account for
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:16.180]  Left-handed and right-handedness that it's not just up down parallax, but like left right
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.980]  that it's you know, everything has a little bit of slop in the one direction because
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:26.180]  You know if it if if the watch knows it's on your left wrist with the crown
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:31.060]  In the upper right it knows something about which way you're likely to
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.420]  You know miss tap with your other hand's index finger
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.700]  Hmm
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.100]  Wow, I just discovered something crazy
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:45.140]  All right, if you if you open an app and very quickly
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.620]  Scroll down on the digital crown it quits the app
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:55.380]  As if you are zooming out of the way you can zoom into it. Oh, yeah if you launch it and then quickly
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.940]  Scroll out it quits it for you
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.100]  Huh weird
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.060]  Yeah, it totally does
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:08.020]  I find that a little weird. I do find it a little weird that you can zoom into an app, but can't zoom out
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:10.900]  But I guess you can but yeah, if you're fast enough now, you can
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.180]  I think that the zooming into an app is seems like a gimmick
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:19.620]  Well to me it only happens by accident, right? When would you ever do it by perp? You know purposefully put an app
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.180]  In the middle and then zoom into it
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.220]  Because you have to you have to have your finger on the screen
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:32.260]  Not the wheel not the crown to get it centered in the first place
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.140]  Right and the only app I ever want to zoom into is the watch
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.780]  Right, which you can zoom into
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:45.460]  Right, and the only app I ever want to zoom into is the watch right which you can do just by tapping the button
[01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:51.380]  You don't even have to zoom in. So I wish that you zooming in anywhere. It's re-centered it onto the watch but
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.260]  maybe that would be
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:59.540]  I don't think that would work. Uh, yeah, I don't know. I I don't know what the alternative is though
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:02.340]  They're not going to zoom into the icon so far that it
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:08.660]  That it blurs and they're not going to stop the zoom at some point are they I don't think so no
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:14.660]  But my point though is that I think that the watch the the watch face world being the primary interface
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.980]  It could have been the only interface
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:22.580]  And there don't now in that in that scenario every app you had would have to be a glance
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.500]  And you couldn't you know, if you deleted the glance you'd be deleting the app
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.700]  Um, but you could do everything that way it now it wouldn't be a good interface for supporting
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:37.380]  More than I mean, what's the what's the most number of those glances that you could have that would be practical?
[01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:41.540]  I would say maybe like 20 and even then it's a lot. I was gonna say five or six
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:46.500]  But well, i'm just saying the maximum. Yeah, 20. Um, and so I think you know
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.780]  I think that I think the basic idea behind the watch is you're going to live in a what you know, most of what you do
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:54.340]  Is is the watch face world
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:14:00.020]  Is is the watch face and stuff you can get from there and you put your favorite?
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.900]  You know five or six things as glances that you can just swipe up to get to
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.500]  You can deal with no most notifications right there without switching to any kind of app
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:18.820]  And then for everything else yada yada yada that's why there's the app mode
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.380]  and you switch to the app mode to do everything else instead of trying to
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.380]  um
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.660]  Shoehorn any additional complaint. I know the whole thing
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.380]  I think then there's so many people who've complained about it being complex
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:36.180]  but I feel like separating this into two different modes and that people don't need to worry about you don't need to
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:41.860]  You know, it took me eight weeks of thinking about it every day to come to this conclusion that it's sort of just two based
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:43.060]  You know two
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:44.980]  two modes that you switch between
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.980]  People don't need to understand that to use it
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.580]  You just you know
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:54.260]  You just kind of have to just keep tapping the crown a couple of times until what you want to see shows up
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.980]  So it is it is a complex interface it is there's a lot of complexity to it
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.500]  I think they put a lot of thought into it
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:05.860]  But I also think that you don't one doesn't need to really understand that to any degree to use it
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.820]  You just kind of have to keep stabbing at the digital crown
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.900]  Maybe twice maybe three times and then you'll be back to where you want to be
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:19.620]  Do you think that the so right now so many of the you know, it's so early so many of the the glances and apps
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.260]  Are effectively the same thing. Do you think they'll
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:27.140]  Differentiate more as people start to understand what these things do
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.740]  Right now it seems like glance is just a dumb version of the app
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:35.540]  Yeah, like a but a version with just one button that launches the app
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.860]  Really because you can't have buttons and glances even apples glances don't have buttons
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:47.060]  Except for while some of them now playing does which is the the glance I use the most really. Yeah
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:52.100]  Yeah, I I I I take a pack apple does cheat with their glances
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.380]  By having buttons. Yeah now playing is a pretty cool one
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.140]  Third-party ones just launched the app and even some apples just launched the app like weather and stuff like that
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:02.980]  I find
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.980]  Like in the early days of using it
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:12.020]  I even knowing and deliberately trying not to use it as a little mini iphone on my wrist. I found myself
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:16.420]  You know when I wanted to do something that wasn't right there on the watch face
[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:21.460]  Like I love the way that you can just touch if you have the temperature showing you just tap the temperature and it jumps
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.060]  You over to the weather app
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.980]  Love that. I love that if you have like a calendar showing you can do the same thing for calendar
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:33.220]  Like I think that's such a great way to jump to your if you use the activity app all the time
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.700]  Just tap it right there on your watch face and you go there
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:41.860]  But then for everything else I would go to the home screen and pan around the thing and launch an app
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:46.100]  I just I found I wasn't using glance as much but but
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:49.860]  Purposefully trying to use glances more. I really do think they're pretty great
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.420]  Yeah, i'm gonna all right. This is like a goal now is to spend more
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.220]  Consciously spend more time with glances
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.580]  I will do that and I will report back
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.580]  And I will report back
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:07.940]  All right, so something we didn't get to talk to at the beginning was I still have about the edition
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.500]  Series and I still have not seen I thought I saw a guy with one the other day
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.100]  But it was just the stainless steel reflecting kind of a warm
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.420]  a warm color
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:25.060]  Yeah, and I haven't even seen any on instagram. I mean besides the celeb, you know the celebs who have their fancy
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:29.460]  Special models. Yeah, I was thinking about it the other day
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.740]  and
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:37.620]  The thought that occurred to me was we spent so much time over the six months between when they announced it and when it came out
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:42.660]  Talking about the addition stuff, you know what, you know speculation on the price
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:50.020]  Commentary on what does it mean for apple as as a whole strategically, you know, is this a shift?
[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:52.180]  Is this something new is it?
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:58.420]  Have they become a new a different company is as bad for the you know, the typical user, you know
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:03.060]  uh, like the two sides of the argument, uh, it and we debated all this to death is
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.060]  it
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:10.180]  Does it mean that apple it only cares about the the super rich because they can get a better?
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.380]  Device than the people who buy the 399
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.380]  sport edition
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:21.380]  Or does it mean that it's great for the typical person because you get a device with the exact same
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:27.880]  Functionality in electronics for 399 dollars that somebody with money to burn spent seventeen thousand dollars on it
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.520]  Right, like there's two ways to look at it
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.320]  But in the I was thinking about the other day, maybe I mean if nobody's buying these things maybe the whole thing is like irrelevant
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.880]  Like it might as well like the difference between the world where the addition line
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.520]  Exists and the hypothetical world where they only had the steel and the sport ones
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.280]  There's no difference between those two worlds because nobody actually has the addition ones
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.280]  And I wonder how many?
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.880]  actual
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.880]  You know models they made
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.520]  I wonder too
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:03.000]  Maybe maybe it truly was limited. Maybe there was like a hundred of each or something. I don't know. I don't know
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.640]  I don't know. It just seems like there's the and it seems so there's the ones that you know
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.800]  That they list and that they show on the website
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:15.960]  They have them in the tables in some of the stores the philly store has the addition ones and that you can you know
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:18.120]  order and buy
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:23.480]  But then there's also like the addition addition ones that they've had some of these press events
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.680]  where there's like band options that aren't even available, you know, like carl lagerford has the
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.960]  The gold milanese loop band. Yeah
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.100]  You know these somebody else had that one too, I don't know if it was it was a beyonce
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.880]  You mean the gold link band link bracelet? No, no, no. Oh really?
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:49.880]  Oh, no, maybe it is. No, maybe you're right. Maybe it was definitely yeah, it was the link price. It was a link bracelet
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.880]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry gold link bracelet
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:53.080]  um
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:59.000]  That aren't even option offered and there were color options that that people had for like the leather bands that you know
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.480]  You can't get elsewhere. That's how you know, you had a good year
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:06.360]  When you get a gold link bracelet, yeah
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.400]  Just you know something that's not even on the website
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.560]  Yeah, I guess I but I that doesn't mean I was thinking about this too, though
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.760]  That doesn't mean though that it was folly for apple to do it
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:25.400]  And it might be like I think that the the cynical take is that it's like just satisfying Johnny Ive and mark newson's
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.960]  Desire to make you know, crazy ass expensive gold watches
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:36.680]  but there might be a practical benefit to it too where it has that psychological effect of
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.760]  the
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.760]  Seven eight nine eleven hundred dollar steel ones looking a lot more
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:50.120]  Purchasable when they're next to ten thousand fifteen thousand dollar gold watches
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:54.840]  Like how do you get someone to buy a thousand dollar watch put it next to a ten thousand dollar watch? Yeah, that's true
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:02.760]  Uh, yeah, I don't know. Well, maybe maybe next time i'm in an international airport. I'll look more closely
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:07.160]  I haven't been to asia yet since uh, they launched so maybe
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.640]  I'll ask my sister in hong kong how many she's seen around the office and we'll
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.440]  We'll get a better idea
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.960]  I wonder if ben thompson has seen any because ben ben would be maybe the guy to
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:22.920]  Maybe spot a couple over there and maybe that is so that would be that would be the uh argument
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.800]  See argument c would be like argument a is that it was just folly argument b is that it's sort of a strategic marketing move
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:32.520]  To make this the steel ones look
[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:34.920]  mid-range and affordable
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.160]  Whereas if there were no gold apple watches the eleven hundred dollar or you know
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:43.800]  Whatever I spade for this space black thing would look extravagant
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:47.560]  Whereas it looks, you know downright cheap compared to a ten thousand dollar one
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:52.440]  Argument c would be that it was that they are selling these things and they're going to sell them
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.520]  But it's all it's totally an asian thing
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.560]  Or just that that was like the last priority in terms of manufacturing them. So they
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.640]  They're holding out right maybe maybe it's like a holiday or
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.960]  and so
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:13.960]  One more question I have is do you think they will update the the offerings at all?
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Before the holiday season
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.760]  Oh, that's a great question. I think no not this year
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.760]  Not even any new bands or anything like that. Yeah, I wonder if maybe they would come
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:31.880]  That would be something that it wouldn't surprise me that maybe like come september when they have new iphones to announce
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:39.400]  And last year the watch shared the stage with the iphone. Maybe the watch shares the stage with the iphone again and
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.080]  Maybe maybe they've got the third-party sdk update ready to ship
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:50.280]  If not, maybe it's you know, at least some kind of update on it, you know, I presume we're going to hear about that
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.040]  Wwc next month
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.960]  Um, and that developers will get to start writing
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.480]  The native apps that run on the watch not just watch kit
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:04.440]  Apps running on the phone projected on the watch but that that's not going to ship to you know
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:10.200]  In a consumer update to the watch for for months and months to come but maybe they'll show that in september and then maybe to
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.360]  Have something to sell though. They'll have new bands
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:17.560]  That's you know, and there was one of those celebrity instagram photos where they had
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.760]  Uh, you know a rainbow of sport bands, uh, on offer
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.400]  And you know having the sport model
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:31.400]  I'm, very excited about the idea of having many different because these bands are 50 bucks or you know
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.280]  probably third-party ones will be even even less i'm very excited about the opportunity to
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:43.640]  Have three or four different color bands to where with different, uh, you know during different seasons or whatever
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.760]  And some of those other colors like the yellow look super cool
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.600]  I would definitely want like a navy blue or something like that. So
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:54.040]  I hope that those exist sooner than later
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:24:00.600]  My son would love a red one like a project red red. Yeah, like any kind of funky red just red
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.320]  He's got the the black, you know sport model
[01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:07.800]  I think it would look great. That'd be a great combo. Yeah. Yeah, but that seems like the most natural combo
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.560]  In fact, the beats headphones I have right here are black and red. I mean red is a
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.840]  Is a fantastic combo. Yeah, you gotta imagine that's gonna happen at some point
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:23.400]  uh, it seems like they've had enough trouble just getting the the ones they've they picked out the door so
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:30.280]  yeah, I think too I that there's sort of a the apple has looked and part of the thing with the watch thing is
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.040]  That yes, they are more personal and you do want to personalize it. But the funny thing is like
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:40.920]  So I get the live version of the talk show at wwc next month, which I have to talk about
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:45.080]  Don't let me sign off on the show without talking about it
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:50.520]  But let's face it, you know that at that live talk show at wwc in san francisco next month
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.640]  That out of 500 people in the room. There's probably going to be about 480 wearing an apple watch
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:01.400]  And yes, they're going to be all sorts of bands and band colors, but there's probably going to be 300 of them wearing the black sport
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.640]  With the black. Yeah sport band
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:09.960]  And even with if every single sport and steel
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.960]  Combination is
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.240]  somebody has it
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.080]  Well, there's a you know, there's a uniformity there that holy crap
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.200]  This room is full of people wearing an apple watch with all the different different
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:27.160]  Holy crap, this room is full of people wearing an apple watch with all the different. I mean, it's still it's way less
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.420]  You know, it's way closer to being uniform than being individual
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:39.080]  Even given that and that need to you know, have some kind of expression with the watch thing the band that you choose
[01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:44.360]  I do think that apple has looked at the the case market for phones and how
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:49.240]  You know such a large majority of people put their phones in a case
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.640]  And how much money that represents and that they are kind of looking at these bands and yes
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.000]  There's going to be a third-party band program and they're going to have a certified thing
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.360]  And they're going to take a cut out of the certified stuff that they sell through the store and it has the made for apple
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  watch logo
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.640]  But they're really looking at and they're like we would like to take most of the money from people buying third-party bands
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.640]  So we're going to have a lot of them
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:18.600]  Like they totally could have watched launched the first version of the watch with a far fewer band companies
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.120]  and combinations
[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.720]  Oh, definitely
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.560]  And I think that they just looked at it as this is just pure not pure margin
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.640]  but there's an awful lot of margin, you know by
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:31.640]  upselling everybody or a large majority of people to
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.240]  An extra fifty dollars or even more more. Yeah
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.400]  150 for
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.000]  i'm kind of eyeing the blue, uh leather loop, but I want to try it on first and it's still
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.120]  two to three weeks shipping time so
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.560]  Hmm
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.840]  We'll see
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.360]  Breaking news. You know what? I'm going to hold this i'll come back to the breaking news
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:57.800]  Let's do a sponsor read and uh, and then i'll come back remind me to go to the to to the uh breaking news
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:00.360]  but
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:05.720]  Let me tell you about our next sponsor and it is another one of our uh, longtime friends of the show igloo
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.120]  igloo makes the intranet you'll actually like
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:16.440]  Um intra int ra it's a it, you know, if you've never heard of intranet, maybe you're young. Maybe you don't know
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.240]  Uh in the late 90s it I I feel like this is worth going over for the kids
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.320]  So in the late 90s when the internet
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.360]  You know blew up and became a huge thing
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.160]  Companies enterprises teams said well, this is great
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:38.360]  But we need something private something that is off the public internet for us to use for private communication
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:45.960]  Secure communication within our team. And so the word intranet came up and it's just like the internet except it's within your little team
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.320]  And there's companies like microsoft has like sharepoint and there's other ones
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.440]  And they all blew you know blew up and people spent tons of money on all this crap
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.960]  And it stinks and everybody hates it and it became anybody who's ever had to use an intranet
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.920]  It's like a dirty word. It's like
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.440]  So igloo they what they've done is they've taken that word which has sort of become a dirty word and they're embracing it and they're saying
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:16.200]  Look, here's an intranet. This is a great the basic idea of making a little private thing for your team to communicate on
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.560]  With a whole bunch of features is a great idea and let's just keep the word and we're going to make one
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:25.160]  That you're actually going to like so you sign up for igloo. You have your team
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.800]  You get all sorts of stuff little apps that are built into the system shared calendars
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:35.400]  Twitter like microblog so you can have like your own little team twitter type thing where you post things like tweets
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.120]  Except it's not on twitter. It's totally private. It's right there on your internet
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.920]  file sharing task management
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.840]  and more
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.680]  It's everything you need to work better together in one very configurable cloud platform
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:55.720]  They've added new features recently. They've got this thing where you can get
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:29:01.240]  Um, uh, uh, if you have like a document that has to have you know
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.240]  Somebody else like me and you are on a team for the talk show and you i've got to get you
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.760]  To sign off on the thing I can do that
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.880]  I can share the file and have like a read receipt, you know
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.760]  Like a read receipt for email to prove that you saw it. I can prove that dan frohmer saw this document
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:21.960]  Through this new feature in igloo really great if you've got that sort of process on your computer
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.040]  Through this new feature in igloo really great if you've got that sort of process on your team
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.520]  um
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.960]  Uh, they igloo always brags about this thing. They've got this thing called gartner's magic quadrant
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:39.080]  And it sounds like a bunch of gibberish but it's really what it means is gartner goes through
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:43.000]  And ranks a whole bunch of internet type software
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:49.320]  From all sorts of big names microsoft ibm. Google vmware salesforce sap all this stuff
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.760]  Well igloo is listed alongside all those big companies for the sixth consecutive year
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.040]  Praised by gartner for the ease of use that you don't need to be technical to set it up
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.840]  That you get great support
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:09.640]  They're competing with all those big companies in terms of what igloo's platform does but they do it in a way
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.040]  That is like totally modern really cool
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.600]  All through the web everything is scalable. Everything is responsive so you can use your phone you can use your tablet
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.440]  You can use your desktop
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.400]  Best of all, here's the thing. Uh, it's free to try

[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.920]  So breaking news, uh, I told you before renee richie was waiting on his space black
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:12.760]  Uh apple watch it arrived while we were doing the show. He texted me. Uh, his band came out fine. No, no friction
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.600]  Me
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.600]  Nice breaking news
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:21.240]  More breaking news apple stores to begin stocking watch bands this week
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.200]  from from scoop german
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:33.800]  Is that your new name for for young mark german should be yeah kids on fire lately he had like three today
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:37.560]  so one of them I was going to ask you about so, uh,
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.360]  more more details from
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.080]  ios 9 including the switch to san francisco as the
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:50.520]  Default system font. So first of all, do you think there's going to be an ios 9?
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.800]  Yes, as in like right now
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:01.720]  Yeah, I think I I would expect that it'll that I think that they really apple really likes annual schedules. And so I think
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.720]  that
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.600]  at
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:12.520]  WWDC in three weeks there will be ios 9 will be revealed mac os 10 10.11 will be revealed
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.600]  and
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.600]  We'll get them in the fall
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.520]  Cool
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:19.880]  I think I agree
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.560]  There's a lot of you know, and german himself has reported that that there might be more of a shift towards. Um,
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.780]  Reliability and bug fixing
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:35.460]  Uh as opposed to really laying it on thick with a lot of new features, uh, which I think is also
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.140]  I don't think it's partially in response to actual, you know, the reality
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:40.820]  of
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.820]  oh, you know ios 8 and
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:49.300]  The current, you know, yosemite and I think partially that that's the natural ebb and flow of the way these things go
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.540]  That they've spent the last few years
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:55.620]  Doing things that had to they had to do all at once like if you're going to add these
[01:32:55.620 --> 01:33:00.600]  Continuity type features where the two os's hand stuff off and and share so much
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.200]  um
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.320]  There's no way to kind of do that halfway. You've kind of got to go all in
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.400]  um
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:12.760]  But yeah, I totally think we'll see that i'd be i'd be and i'd be way more surprised if we don't see ios 9
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.280]  Because I feel like they they've had a new version of ios every year
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:21.240]  Yeah, I I agree. Uh, I think it's interesting. It's crazy how
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:25.400]  It's only a year ago that so many of these features were introduced too
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.000]  and
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.280]  they already
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.400]  seem
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:32.440]  You know like just part of the part of the way everything works
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.060]  Uh, I imagine since you know, you could kind of see if you go back and look at last year's announcements
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.920]  How they foreshadow a lot of the ways that the phone and watch
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.480]  Uh talk to each other
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.760]  um
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:51.720]  And now that all that stuff is kind of public. I would guess that there would be some more
[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:56.920]  Integrations between the watch and the phone and the mac and all that kind of stuff
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.280]  Yeah, I definitely think so. I mean i'm curious to see what they do. I mean probably
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.000]  Well, I don't know. It's hard to say because the watch is such a peripheral to the phone
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.420]  You know that the watch isn't really like a standalone member of the tribe. It's like a addition to the phone in particular
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:20.380]  It's interesting how in the in the apple store, they have a watch paired to an ipad, but you can't do that as a
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.260]  as a mortal
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:29.900]  No, I didn't know you could do that in the store. Yeah, they they're those demo units unless they're hiding a phone inside that crazy case
[01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:35.980]  Too those watch the live demos, which are kind of in that crazy case. Yeah
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.980]  That's an ipad mini that's
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.140]  In that same case, so I imagine that's what it's hooked up to
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:50.220]  I had the thought today and it was it was reminded of it earlier in the show when I was telling you that the one time
[01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:55.020]  I unpaired the watch from my phone was to go back to the 5s to see what it was like using a 5s with the watch
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:00.700]  That the next time I have a new iphone to review it's going to be weird
[01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:06.080]  Oh, yeah, because I guess i'll have to unpair
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:14.000]  to unpair my watch I mean unless I stop using the watch too, right, but the you know, that doesn't really seem like
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.280]  Notwithstanding
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:19.120]  whether or not I
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.960]  Am in the mood to keep wearing the watch
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.120]  I feel like as a reviewer part of the review process is how does it work with apple watch?
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.200]  But i'm going to have to you can't have your watch paired with more than one phone at a time
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.240]  And you can't have more than one watch paired with your phone at a time
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.040]  It's one watch per phone one phone per watch and that makes a review unit
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.720]  That i'm only really using for two or three weeks full-time sort of a pain in the ass
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:46.560]  Well, we'll we'll first see how annoying it is when the ios betas come out in a few weeks
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.840]  How how does that work?
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.960]  I guess you probably won't run that on your main device so it won't affect the watch
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.360]  But if you want to do something if you want to test something
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.920]  On the watch. Yeah, the way i've done it the last few years is i've waited
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:08.800]  Until sometime in july to update to the ios beta like I don't I don't run the builds from june
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.560]  And I leave that to the kids i'm too old
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:19.440]  But I do update before, you know at some point in july or august before before it actually ships. Yeah
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.320]  Yeah, that would be interesting with the watch too. I don't know
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.240]  Do so, uh, what do you think of this the move to san francisco?
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.240]  to san francisco
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.920]  Uh, i'm not surprised. I think it'll probably look good. Um
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.800]  The caveat being that there's like a hack
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.720]  I mean I talked about this months ago on the show
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:41.380]  But somebody came up with a hack on github for if you download the versions of san francisco
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:47.040]  There's two two versions of sam two families. There's san francisco text and san francisco display
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.240]  uh
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.560]  and text just means smaller and display means bigger more or less like the display variant of any font usually means something that you're
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.880]  Going to put at a display size meaning a big size
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:02.560]  And that there's differences between some of the characters subtle differences in the character shapes and the spacing
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.200]  Based on the presumption of how big it's going to be
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:10.480]  Um, somebody made a hack and they published it on github so that you could use
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.240]  um
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.140]  San francisco as the font in yosemite os 10 10.10.10
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:24.400]  Um, and I installed that and then I felt like I was going back, you know to my early, you know
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.920]  The younger days when I would install all sorts of crazy interface hacks on my system
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:33.040]  Because I was so curious about it and I felt like it looked okay, but it didn't look great
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.400]  But my guess is that that just means that they need to make some more tweaks to the font to make it look
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.800]  Right at the optical sizes that it appears on a mac compared to the watch
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.880]  Like I feel like the version that they shipped already
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:50.960]  Is truly optimized where even on the watch display text is still tiny because it's a tiny little watch
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.040]  And on the mac, it's a much more reasonable size. So I feel like it, you know
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.080]  I think it'll look good and I think on ios it'll look good, too
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.880]  yeah, i've gotten used to helvetica on the mac, but
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:09.040]  You know, it's i'm not glued to it. Yeah, i'm sure for a company that sweats the details like apple
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:11.760]  They'll make sure that it looks good at all those
[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.000]  system sizes
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.920]  Right and it you know, it's always been a little weird to me
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:24.560]  I've always thought that ios or not. I was helvetica and i'm just going to say helvetica and not just mention helvetica
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.840]  Noia at you know as a separate font, but let's just say helvetica
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.160]  um
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:34.240]  I've always thought it was a curious choice for a system font
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.320]  And you know and it's been the system font on ios all the way from the original iphone
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.640]  And I love it on the iphone
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.280]  I've you know
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:48.000]  it's not if some people think because I often say good things about helvetica that it's like my favorite font and it's not even close but
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.240]  I do like it and appreciate it for what it is
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.800]  and I think it's such a humble choice on apple's part back in 2007 because it's you know,
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.160]  Helvetica is helvetica. It's the you know, it's
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:08.720]  The only font that there's been a movie made about it's the default font in text documents, you know in text edit
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:14.400]  It's also not owned by apple. So any other anybody else can make a phone, you know
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:20.640]  And hcc has done it other companies have done it where if they license helvetica, they can use helvetica on their phones, too
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:25.920]  Whereas if you own your own font like they do with san francisco apple has a font that you know
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.800]  Can be part of their unique identity and nobody else can use it
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:34.960]  It's the new chicago right did they own chicago? Yeah, definitely
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.880]  Definitely
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.320]  What an ugly font I mean well, but it was perfect for it was yeah
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:46.080]  It was a perfect bitmap like yeah, 640 by 480. That's something I want to talk about
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.280]  At the there's a conference going on alongside wwdc this year the layers conference
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:59.520]  It's a design conference take two blocks away from moscone on tuesday and wednesday of wwdc week and i'm uh, susan care who designed
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.960]  Chicago is like the headline keynote speaker
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.920]  Uh, and then i'm doing a thing where i'm going to interview susan care on stage, uh, you know after her thing
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.080]  I would love I can't wait to talk to her about chicago in particular because to me chicago
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.720]  Is a is one of the weirdest fonts i've ever seen i've i loved it
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.800]  I love but only loved it at exactly 12 pixels. It was pixel font
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:26.320]  But like it's such a weird font like there's no other font that it it it doesn't look like anything else
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:29.120]  It doesn't look like like like helvetica
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.800]  Like helvetica, it's certainly you know, it is a san serif so it doesn't look like any serif font there ever was
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:36.400]  um
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.400]  But it's just weird. It's in a way
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.920]  It's sort of like bridge the gap between the pre gooey world
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:48.640]  And the gooey world where it sort of had some of the characteristics of like the fonts from the era before we had
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:56.880]  Proper type of graphic fonts, you know fonts that were really meant to fit on a pixel grid not any kind of high resolution grid
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.880]  I uh
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.240]  when I started splat f in 2007 I was
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.480]  monkeying around with different logos and fonts for the
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.880]  you know the title and I was
[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.440]  Going to try to use chicago, but it was just so
[01:41:13.020 --> 01:41:17.680]  Impractical at you know any any web resolution let alone retina resolution
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.580]  It just right couldn't work every time and then so I feel like apple was in a quandary
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:27.220]  when true type came out in system 7 and they couldn't get rid of
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.580]  Chicago
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:33.860]  And in fact, it was still the system font when system 7 shipped
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:38.580]  they didn't switch the system font until the you know, the redesign of the gooey with
[01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.460]  mac os 8
[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:44.020]  But it needed to be true type I give you know
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:47.380]  All the system fonts for true type if some of them were true type they all had to be true type
[01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.380]  so they made a true type version of chicago
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:54.420]  And then once they did that people started using it, you know out in the real world
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:59.940]  And every time i've ever seen it in my life like used. Oh, yeah and a sign or something right?
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:05.540]  It's always like wow, you have no idea what you're doing. Yeah, whoever whoever chose that font should be
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:12.660]  Should have their license to choose fonts away. Do you ever see the welcome to macintosh podcast by young mark bramhill?
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:17.540]  I saw i've seen that it exists, but I haven't checked it out. So he uses it properly
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:20.500]  So he uses it properly. You can you can go there at macintosh
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.500]  Macintosh.fm
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:30.340]  It's a great podcast by a really really smart, uh young man named mark bramhill, but he's he's got his logo set in
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:36.100]  Chicago, but of course, it's the bitmap version of chicago. Not the not the true type version
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.140]  I love it because mark mark i've met him. He was actually at the uh,
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.820]  when I was in new york and did the book thing, uh when I interviewed, uh, the authors of uh,
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:51.700]  Becoming steve jobs a couple weeks ago. Oh, yeah, he happened to be passing through new york
[01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:55.380]  He lives like somewhere down in the southwest and he was passing through new york with his dad
[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:02.180]  I think he's like 20 years old 19 years old something like that. So he's way younger than the bitmap
[01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:07.780]  Macintosh era but this is like the identity that he's chosen for his podcast, which really warms my heart
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:13.700]  Like to him though. It's totally retro you you did such a hilariously gruberish, uh,
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:18.100]  Non-promotion of that event. I totally would have gone. I didn't even know it was happening
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:20.420]  Ah, you know, so I didn't
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:26.420]  That that really wasn't though. That wasn't gruberish it came across that way in other words
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:31.620]  I didn't link to it or I didn't say anything publicly. I didn't even tweet that I was doing it. They told me not to
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.620]  Oh, okay, just to keep it. Um
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:37.300]  So they wouldn't need 50 security guards and
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:42.740]  Well, it might that's the thing is it it bothered me because there were a few empty seats
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.140]  And I know if I had tweeted it it there wouldn't have been
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:52.180]  I hate to see empty seats and there were so many people who said that afterwards said the same thing like just friend just
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:56.180]  Personal friends of mine who live in new york. You're like that's why didn't you tell me you're you know doing this but the
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:59.380]  the publishers of the book crown publishing
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:06.340]  And they did they like I think it was like 90 full so they did fill 90 of the seats and it would and therefore
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:10.260]  Because their promotions filled 90 of the seats if I had tweeted it
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:17.140]  If I had tweeted it it I guarantee it would have been overflow. There would have been people turned away. So what would have been better?
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:23.460]  Having a couple of empty seats or having you know dozens and dozens of people turned away at the door
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:27.940]  Because that store the the theater at that store in soho is really pretty small small
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:32.180]  Yeah, I wanted to go to uh real by the way real time follow-up as they say
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:36.120]  Uh, I did not start splat f in 2007. It was 2011
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:41.320]  And I just realized that I always messed those two years up because those are the years that I switched
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:49.160]  Jobs, um, and they rhyme. Yes, and there was an event in 2007 with uh, I want to say jason schwartzman or
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:50.840]  the uh
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:57.000]  No, well, yeah, because he was in the short it was something with uh, wes anderson maybe at the apple
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.040]  He said everything he's in everything with wes anderson. Yeah, who knows what movie well
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.480]  I think it was wes anderson speaking at the apple store or something like that
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:09.420]  And that was they had a line around the block or something like that. So I couldn't get into that and that was kind of disappointing
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:16.040]  Uh, so you don't want that to happen either. No, so I wasn't trying to be coy and I wasn't trying to be secretive
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.960]  But and it wasn't like they banned me. They were just like don't worry about it. You don't have to link it
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:22.840]  You know, we'll take care of that place. So I was like, okay, whatever you say
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:28.440]  That's so I don't ever don't know anybody who is upset that they didn't hear about it on during fireball
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.840]  I was you know, I was just doing what they suggested
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.600]  It
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.920]  Anyway, I think san francisco should turn out great
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:36.440]  I don't think it like I said
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:41.720]  I think installing the versions that they shipped right now as is is not going to give you the look that they're after but
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.680]  I'm with you. I mean, there's no way that apple's going to ship it if it looks ugly
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.880]  No, I think it's it's good and they're kind of setting the ground long term also for
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.240]  You know all these things to look more like each other
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:59.560]  Yeah, and I think you know, there's an argument to be made that that helvetica was never a great system font
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.560]  That there's a certain role that the system font plays that helvetica isn't great at I think it's a great font
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:11.560]  And I think it's a humble choice. But you know, it doesn't really look like a label and that's what ui font really is
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  They're like labels
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:20.360]  I also think it's pretty clear that they're shifting to using it like for any kind of user interface including hardware because the new keyboard
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:27.800]  On the uh, the the single port macbook uses san francisco as the keycap font on the keyboard as well
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:31.080]  And it looks good. I mean, I you know, I haven't I I don't notice that so
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:38.280]  Looks good to me. Oh you have that. That's the computer yet. I do. Yeah using it right now. I'm not no I uh,
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:42.040]  Well as I was complaining earlier, there's not really
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.800]  With something like this, uh, and i'm sure apple's busy, but it would have been a lot
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:53.560]  I think they could have done a little more accessories in the usb realm for this thing
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:58.280]  uh, you know, they had the the eighty dollar stuff that most people don't need but
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:07.080]  I I would have loved to have seen some sort of proper hub or chart some more interesting charging options or
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.040]  Even a usb-c to lightning cable
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:16.600]  Yeah, like an elegant hub. Yeah, just some just you know, and it's easy add-on sales
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.360]  Like I probably would have ordered a bunch of that kind of stuff instead i've been ordering
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:27.880]  Usb cords off amazon and they're all random manufacturers. They're all too short. None of them are any good
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:34.600]  I have i'm gonna have to send one back. So I I only use it for stuff that uh,
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.400]  That I I don't need to connect anything to it
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:41.180]  But it's great, you know, it is extremely
[01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:49.020]  Sexy machine is as much as a laptop can be a sexy machine space black. No, or space gray
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.580]  I'm, i'm a purist to me the most beautiful
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:57.020]  Mac ever is the you know, the original power book. Well the original
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:01.420]  Titanium silver power book. So titanium ones
[01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:07.180]  Uh, I never had a titanium one my my first actually and this should be it at some point of post
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:13.980]  But my first laptop that I ever bought with my own money was the 12-inch power book
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:16.300]  g4
[01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.300]  uh g3
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:22.060]  G4 I don't remember what chip was in there. I think a g4
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:27.660]  Yeah, what color was it? So it was the aluminum 12-inch, you know, I think the aluminums were always g4
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.660]  yeah, they were g4 and
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:32.940]  It was it was really great, but it was also great
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:39.980]  extraordinarily limited and and very heavy and as a result, even though it was compact
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:42.380]  I never really took it anywhere. So it's completely
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.100]  Kind of dumb as a laptop
[01:48:46.540 --> 01:48:49.420]  But to me those are just super beautiful machines
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:54.940]  So i've you know, even though I had choices for what colors I also and i've seen some other people say this too
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:58.780]  That space gray just reminds me so much of the sony vox
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:04.300]  that my friends had and hated that. I don't know just a weird, uh, a weird thing in my head
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:06.860]  So I as a purist I stuck with the silver
[01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.820]  Aluminum and it's beautiful. I really like it
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.700]  uh, and the screen is is
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.820]  it's my first retina mac and
[01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.820]  It really makes me realize how bad my vision has gotten
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:24.060]  It's like wow, this is blurry and how bad am I seeing?
[01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:29.660]  Um, no, it's cool. Uh, you know, we don't we don't need to get into review territory, but uh,
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.780]  I'm happy with I did not return it
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.500]  Um
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:41.900]  Do you see marco armand got one and he really did not like it that did not like that's what I was winking at
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.100]  Yeah, it does not like it does not like the keyboard
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:50.300]  Uh doesn't like the trackpad which really surprised me. I don't really like it. I don't really like it
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:55.180]  The keyboard, uh doesn't like the trackpad which really surprised me. I have not spent time with it
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:58.940]  I've only played with it in a store, but i've liked the way it feels in the store
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:04.780]  Um, not surprised. He doesn't like the keyboard and he found it to be too slow. So he's he's actually returning it
[01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.260]  Neither of those two things bother me
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:15.100]  Uh, the screen is is nice. I I it was not as I was not as blown away as I thought I would be by the screen
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:18.460]  I don't know if that's my vision or the actual screen
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.640]  Uh, the thing that that is a little I would say the most disappointing
[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.580]  is the speed and um
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.480]  You know, i'm still using a 2010
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.940]  macbook air
[01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:32.940]  13 inch yeah
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.940]  And it's still very fast
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:38.800]  It's probably the most impressive computer i've ever purchased
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:43.580]  Yeah, I had a 2010 macbook, but the 11 inch and I used it until last year
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:47.420]  I mean I used that a long time or maybe mine was 2011. So not at 2010
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:54.700]  but anyway, but that vintage of air I thought held up very well amazing and this I know is not going to I mean right now even
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:00.140]  even brand new it's doesn't feel very fast, which is fine. I use it for for
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.100]  you know writing blog posts, but
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:07.820]  I'm, not gonna I don't think i'm gonna get four years out of it. Uh, let me take a break
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:14.940]  And thank our final sponsor and then we'll wrap up the show and i'm gonna I have information I have details to reveal about the live
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.660]  episode of the talk show during wwc week
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:24.540]  But first I am going to thank our final sponsor of the show and it's automatic
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.180]  Now i've they've been on the show once or twice before
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.700]  Just spelled exactly like the dictionary word automatic. What is it? It is a small connected car adapter
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:38.700]  It's just a little dingus that you plug into your car's diagnostic port
[01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:43.580]  And I think every car since 1996 has one of these ports
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:49.020]  Somewhere down there underneath the dashboard. There's a little thing that you open up and there's a little tiny port. It's
[01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:55.900]  Industry-wide you plug the automatic in there and then you get access to this port the way that like
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:01.100]  Mechanics do that's what the mechanics do like when your car has like a light that comes on and says hey go get service
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:03.020]  A2
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:06.860]  How does that get reset after they actually do surface a2 they use this port?
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:10.780]  So you can go in there you use this check engine light comes on you plug, you know
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:14.780]  Your automatic will tell you in plain english exactly what's going on
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:20.060]  So instead of just knowing hey something has gone wrong and the engine lights on you'll know exactly what's on
[01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:27.820]  How do you find out from this dingus? Well, it communicates to a really well-designed app on your iphone and it communicates over bluetooth
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:32.380]  So it's not like you have to sit there and fish this uh, once you install it, you just leave it there
[01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:37.020]  Just leave it you put it in there, uh, and you never worry about it again and you do all your interaction
[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:42.460]  Through the iphone. It's the uh, the internet of things come to life and your car suddenly
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:47.420]  As long as your car was made in 1996 or later, it becomes like a smart car
[01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:52.060]  All sorts of stuff you get information about the diagnostic state of your car
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:59.980]  It scores your driving and coaches you to drive more efficiently and save gas and save wear and tear in your car tells you whether
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:03.660]  You're you know, maybe you're a little too heavy on the gas pedal like uh, like I am
[01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:06.700]  Maybe you're wearing your brakes out too fast. It'll give you advice on stuff like that
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:10.940]  Uh, if you don't want to pay attention to it, you don't have to but it'll give you a warning if you start going too fast
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.060]  Uh, the default is 70. I I crank that up to around 90
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:24.140]  And joking aside they even have something serious like crash detection so it automatic can detect a crash and call for help for free
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:27.980]  A human will even stay on the line with you until help arrives
[01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:31.740]  So hopefully nobody out there is ever going to need that but it's a great way to do that
[01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:36.460]  Nobody out there is ever going to need that but it's a good feature to have if you know if worse comes to worse
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:41.180]  They even have stuff all sorts of stuff this internet of things type stuff
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:44.700]  They've got nest integration to heat your home or turn on the air conditioning turn to you know
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:46.940]  I guess we're heading towards summer so heating isn't really an issue
[01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:49.980]  But you can have the air conditioning turned up as you get close to home
[01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:56.400]  You can find out all sorts of more stuff if you just want to learn about the nest integration stuff go to automatic.com
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:59.420]  Nest and they'll tell you about that
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:03.820]  Uh, and they have all sorts of other ways that you can you know connect this to you can connect it to google docs
[01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:05.500]  You can connect it to twitter
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.540]  evernote
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:07.340]  uh
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.680]  If this then that ifttt.com
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:12.780]  slash automatic has uh information
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:17.740]  Uh anything with an api that you might want to connect your smart car to they can do it
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:23.180]  Sounds fantastic, right? You probably this is very expensive. Guess what? It's a hundred bucks hundred dollar dingus
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:25.980]  You just plug it right in your car and you're done but even better
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:32.220]  Listeners of the show go to automatic.com slash talk show. No, the just slash talk show automatic slash com
[01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:36.540]  Automatic.com slash talk show and you save 20 bucks
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:43.260]  So it's only eighty dollars for you and it ships in two business days and they have a 45-day return policy
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:49.500]  Go there cough up to 80 bucks. They'll send you the thing 44 days go by and you're not impressed
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.620]  Just send it back to them and you get all your money back. So my thanks to automatic
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:54.620]  My thanks to automatic
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:57.580]  Um, so what else we got what else happened this week? Um
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:01.260]  That's an
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.820]  Yeah, that was funny verizon bought aol. Nah
[01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.780]  Is that interesting? Not really
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:11.260]  I don't really think so because I think I think the only thing that was really interesting to me is just how
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:19.340]  How far aol has fallen that they were worth like when the time warner thing went went down in the first.com era
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:25.020]  They were a 380 billion dollar company and they sold the verizon. Yeah, that was that was a good chart
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:28.540]  And a similar stat that I heard
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:35.260]  Uh that I read a couple weeks ago was that if you had bought amazon stock at the top of the bubble like the highest
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:37.260]  point of the bubble
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:41.340]  Uh, you still would have made a very nice profit holding on to it by now
[01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:47.740]  So yeah, it would have been you would have beat the market several times the s and p over that period so
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:51.020]  Uh the ups and downs of the.com bust I guess
[01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:57.500]  Uh, oh, well, we could talk a little about the wall street journal report about the apple tv
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:03.180]  Oh, yeah, that's yeah, that's definitely what I wanted. I knew there was something. Um, i'm bummed man. So
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:06.540]  How would
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:08.140]  What's the
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:13.740]  The gist of it the timeline seems to be that I I think ikan's letter prompted it
[01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:20.220]  I think what happened so carl ikan, you know, the what would you call him quote-unquote activist investor?
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:24.780]  Activist investor who owns I don't know six billion dollars in apple stock
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:31.420]  Which is a lot of money, but is not a lot, you know, it's not a lot compared to apple's market cap
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:35.340]  But enough that he can make some noise so more than tim cook owns
[01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:38.220]  Yeah, he posted an open letter
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:44.780]  Uh, I thought rather rambling, uh, didn't really have much of a point but and it just was sort of a side note in it that he
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:50.140]  Expects that the reason he expects apple stock to go up to around 200 and he thinks it's worth around
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:56.300]  240 a share and right now it's around 120 to 130. So he expects it to double, you know at some point
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:03.020]  And you know still thinks it's a great investment and one of two of the reasons why is that he thinks that he his firm
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:07.500]  He personally expects apple to begin making quote ultimate
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:13.500]  Ultra high-definition television sets in 2016 and that to enter the electronic car market by 2020
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.260]  And that both of those markets are very big and then the next day
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.340]  Daisuke wakabayashi of the wall street journal had this report
[01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:28.380]  That said i've let me see if I can quote it exactly
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:36.700]  But after nearly a decade of research apple has quietly shelved plans to make such a set more than a year ago
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:39.580]  more than a year ago according to people familiar with the matter
[01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:48.460]  Apple had searched for breakthrough features to justify building an apple branded television set those people said in addition to an ultra high definition display
[01:57:48.620 --> 01:57:53.500]  Apple considered adding sensor equipped cameras so viewers could make video calls through the set
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:58:02.460]  Ultimately though apple executives didn't consider any of those features compelling enough to enter the highly competitive television market led by samsung electronics company
[01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:08.380]  Apple typically likes to enter a new product area with innovative technology and easier to use software
[01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:11.260]  That's you know, and then it goes on from there
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:17.260]  But the article could have ended there if the wall street journal could have three paragraph story that that would have been the story
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:22.060]  I'm, not surprised. I you you you're depressed you you're I mean, no, not really
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:28.460]  I I just I bought a crappy visio tv and I and I learned a life lesson which is don't ever save
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.620]  A hundred dollars when you're buying a tv
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:34.780]  Let's spend spend the extra hundred bucks and get a better tv
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.460]  You know
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:46.220]  You could make the argument that the actual television and I think that's I think this is correct that the actual television piece of glass
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:53.980]  Doesn't matter that much. Uh, you know, they the tv companies of course want it to and they've stuffed all this crappy
[01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:56.620]  quote-unquote smart
[01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:58.620]  software on it
[01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:02.860]  um, but none of it's any good so really what you just want is a
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:05.180]  dumb piece of glass
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.260]  with an hdmi cable running into
[01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.980]  something good
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:12.860]  Yeah, which in this case, you know is either your
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:19.500]  Your cable box or your apple tv or your amazon fire stick or roku or whatever?
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:21.500]  and
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:28.140]  That's fine. I but on the other hand I still have this big screen sitting in my living room and I wish that it was prettier
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.340]  and
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:32.780]  You know, I think that apple could have probably done a much nicer job on that
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:39.100]  Right and sweat the details. I mean, there's all there's an argument to be made that I wish somebody would make an apple style regular tv
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:44.940]  Yeah, just a dumb tv but with apple quality, uh attention to the color
[01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:47.900]  Of the display the quality of the display
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.500]  uh
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:50.700]  the
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:58.380]  The bezel around the display make it something that apple would want to you know use to be like the tvs in the stores, uh
[01:59:58.620 --> 02:00:04.300]  and an apple attend apple type attention to the ports in the back and how they're arranged and the details and
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:10.620]  And the sound and the remote control and you know, even just as simple as the remote works
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:14.620]  which is not right not the you know, we have to get up and
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:18.140]  Basically stand next to the tv to get the remote to work
[02:00:18.140 --> 02:00:23.180]  And yeah, and even even things like what and what does it look like when you switch hdmi inputs?
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:25.980]  Does the font that tells you which one you're switching to look nice?
[02:00:26.380 --> 02:00:31.580]  Exactly. I have to say mine. I have a pi still have an old pioneer plasma that i'm going to hold on to until it
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:33.980]  Breaks because I love plasma so much
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:35.100]  uh
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.100]  And pioneer I I mean an apple
[02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:43.180]  I don't know if they still do because but I mean for years apple had pioneers in the apple stores connected to apple TVs. So
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:48.780]  Uh, I love my pioneer I and and little things like some of the stuff that I just said like where the ports are
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:54.860]  How do you get to them? How how distracting or non-distracting is the bezel around the display all of those things the pioneer did great
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:01.820]  Well, i'm just saying that there's other brands that yeah, so good. No, I I would not recommend a visio to anyone at this point
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:04.220]  I'm still running yahoo widgets
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:09.420]  This is not an old tv. My first tv. My first hdtv
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:15.420]  Was a brand called winbook which was the store brand for micro center
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:19.580]  Which was like a comp usa knockoff in chicago
[02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:22.300]  And this was 2005
[02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:29.500]  And it was like 1200 bucks for 32 inch or something like that and it was amazing
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:31.820]  It was it was it was great. Uh,
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:36.460]  Especially compared to this thing that you know that I just bought a couple years like a year ago
[02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:43.020]  There was half that price and much bigger, but just a piece of crap like the coating on the screen
[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:48.780]  Is has got to be the most reflective coating they could have bought like they almost did it as a joke
[02:01:49.420 --> 02:01:51.420]  So you can you can see your t-shirt
[02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:55.020]  Reflecting in the screen more than you can see the show
[02:01:55.900 --> 02:02:02.060]  Depending on the light like we try to watch tv during the day the other day just you can't do it because what were they thinking?
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.540]  You can't do it because what were they thinking? I don't know and and this is you know
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:12.060]  i'm an idiot for 100 bucks more I could have got a samsung with probably a better coding and all that stuff but
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:19.500]  So don't ever save 100 bucks on a tv and don't buy a visio. We've got a samsung upstairs and uh,
[02:02:20.140 --> 02:02:24.540]  It didn't didn't even pick it out. It's like it was like a
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:30.380]  Reward that my wife got she she does like this charity thing for food allergies. Oh, yeah, I donate
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:34.380]  it and she's raised a ton of bucks over the years and and
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.860]  Because she was like the biggest
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:38.300]  I don't know
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.620]  She I don't know if it was the city or the state or something
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:44.060]  But she was the biggest fundraiser in the state and she got a samsung tv
[02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:45.980]  um
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:47.980]  cool, and but it
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:51.020]  Even that samsung isn't that good in my opinion?
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:54.940]  Like if you turn it on it plays a sound like the windows the old windows startup chime
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:59.420]  And it annoys me and I can't I there maybe there's some way to turn it off. I can't figure it out
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:05.020]  I've tried it just annoys me to know why in the world would I want my tv to play a jingle? Well, you know
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:09.020]  When I turn it on just turn on all I want you to do is turn on
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:14.700]  I hate it. I think it also plays a jingle when you power it off too. So so we're getting somewhere
[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:18.940]  So there's definitely a market for a an apple quality
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:23.740]  TV television. Yeah, but I don't think it's a good I don't think it's a good business, right?
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:30.060]  You know what I mean? Right like people like me would buy I would pay extra for an apple just a dumb tv an apple
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:32.780]  Ht, you know high def tv
[02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:40.540]  With hdmi inputs or maybe you know in my the the idea was always that it would have an apple tv built into it
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:46.300]  But then i've even thought about that like I don't even know how much sense that makes because what you know, apple doesn't
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.700]  Rev the apple
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:54.860]  Tv hardware every year certainly not yet. Maybe they will going forward but you know to date
[02:03:54.940 --> 02:04:00.300]  I guess they've only been like three generations of it the old one and then two two versions of the new apple tv
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:01.900]  um
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:04.860]  But I expect a tv to last many years
[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:10.860]  You know and so building the apple tv stuff into the tv doesn't I don't know how smart that is, right?
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:13.340]  Because if the you know, if one version of the software
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:16.540]  Only runs on a certain a chip then
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:18.540]  What do you you're not going to throw out your tv?
[02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:25.100]  Uh, this is one of these things where I think a decade ago totally would have made sense given where apple was at that point
[02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:29.100]  But now when they're in the you know in the reality of shipping
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:32.220]  Hundreds of millions of devices a year
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:38.940]  Increasingly smaller devices have you know building some product line that has
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:45.260]  You know tens of millions of customers maximum and is a huge box that they have to ship
[02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:48.380]  I just it doesn't make it doesn't seem to be
[02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:54.940]  To reflect today's apple very well. So yeah, and the other thing too is if apple wants to go
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:05:02.220]  Like with the iphone, uh, six plus they switch to this new three x retina resolution
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:07.180]  But it's not really three x it's 1920 by whatever and that they just uh,
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:12.460]  Upscale to three x and then downscale to fit the screen they can do that because they control everything, right?
[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:14.860]  They control the ios they control, you know
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:20.620]  And they have all and they know that developers will get on board and do the right thing and update to 3x retina graphics
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:27.420]  And stuff like that with tv they don't have that they can't they can't force the industry to go to
[02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:33.020]  You know, whatever this ultra high def format is 4k types, you know 4k
[02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:37.180]  Content and I know netflix has a little bit of 4k stuff like house of cards. You can get in 4k
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:46.640]  But it's like to me the advantage of them pushing ahead with like hey here's a breakthrough in high definition resolution
[02:05:47.020 --> 02:05:51.500]  They can't make the industry ship content in that resolution and then therefore what's the point of it?
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:58.060]  Like it just the advantages of apple doing it just don't seem as apparent to me as as with the devices where they control everything
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:06:03.580]  and I guess just the difference between those two strategies is big enough that
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:09.900]  I think and I think that they've kind of proven they and roku and amazon and everyone has proven that
[02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:17.500]  You know enough people will buy and add on a little puck to their tv that that's a viable strategy to reach
[02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:22.380]  You know a good percentage of of households at least in the us
[02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:27.980]  Yeah, which is which is you know, and unlike
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:33.420]  Their phone business which they've now have, you know, incredible worldwide distribution
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:39.920]  This tv stuff is going to probably be us only for a while. I mean that the rights negotiations
[02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:45.740]  Is still very much on a country by country basis if you look at see how long it took netflix to
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.420]  Yeah to to get into different markets. Um
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:52.460]  You know it I I would be shocked if they had
[02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:57.420]  More than four or five countries of tv service at the beginning
[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:04.300]  Yeah, um, I also think and I wrote about this on daring fireball that and and that apple it seems to me that this
[02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:11.180]  The scoop that the journal got was from apple that I can said hey, we think they're going to do a high definition tv
[02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:13.180]  People have been saying this forever
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:17.740]  You know gene munster's been on it for a decade that apple's going to do a whole tv series
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:19.740]  That apple's going to do a whole tv set
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:22.380]  uh, and I feel like
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:28.700]  The journal report you never know who these people familiar with the matter are because sometimes they clearly aren't that familiar with it at all
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:34.780]  I think in this case, they probably are and I I think that the just the common sense ockham's razor is
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:38.960]  There's widely rumored to be new apple tv hardware coming at wwdc
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:42.620]  Including a software development kit so that you can write apps for it
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:47.900]  Um, I don't know anything about that. I I know in years past I know things and I coyly
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:52.300]  You know put them forward and you know, I I know a little bit more than I learn in this case
[02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:55.500]  I don't know anything. I don't know any anybody who's told me this other than that
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:08:00.380]  I know an awful lot of people who tell me that they've been told, you know third hand or whatever
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:03.260]  yeah, this is all coming at wwdc and uh
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:06.300]  Again, scoop german has been all over it
[02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:10.300]  Uh, I don't think anybody's gonna be surprised if there's new apple tv hardware
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:13.120]  at wwdc and the sdk
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:20.220]  I think that apple wanted to get out on top of this and they want to nip this
[02:08:20.460 --> 02:08:22.460]  But maybe they'll do a whole tv set too
[02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:28.780]  Because they're not going to do a tv set and they don't want people waiting for it that if you if what they announce in june
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:34.620]  As a little box that you connect to your tv by hdmi if that sounds interesting to you go and buy it
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:37.820]  Don't hold your breath and wait for a tv set from us
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:41.420]  Because I think if they didn't get on top of it, that's what everybody would think they think well, that sounds cool
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.940]  But maybe i'll just wait for the tv set that carl. I can tells me I should be waiting for
[02:08:46.220 --> 02:08:49.260]  Right, and I think it's also a way of saying hey, uh, you know
[02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:57.260]  Analysts and investors who are making their financial models for apple for the next 10 years. Don't don't bet on some
[02:08:58.620 --> 02:09:03.420]  Great product line, you know with with two thousand dollar 5k tvs either
[02:09:03.420 --> 02:09:07.820]  Yeah, because that's the thing too is even if they make an apple tv that becomes very popular
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:10.380]  It seems to be that the market for these things is about 100 bucks
[02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:15.980]  So there's not a lot of money in selling the hardware like whatever money there might be for them in this is in the content side
[02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:19.340]  It's the services and and icloud
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:21.180]  You know whatever
[02:09:21.180 --> 02:09:27.420]  Right selling the movies and tv shows through itunes taking the 30 cut of all the apps and games that you buy
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:33.500]  And whatever cut they get from netflix for you know, there's being built in and etc, etc
[02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:37.260]  but it's a content play more than a you know than a
[02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:44.060]  Hey, we're selling three thousand dollar ultra high def tvs. Yeah, and i've heard and you know, i've read that
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:48.940]  They're really pushing on this content thing to launch in september. So
[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:51.660]  We'll see
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:53.740]  Yeah, but they've been on that for a long time
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:56.140]  with struggle I mean
[02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:57.660]  you know and and
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.660]  probably for good reason that the
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:01.100]  tv and
[02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.860]  and movie industry
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:06.140]  has seen what happened to the record labels and is
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:09.580]  pretty pretty much still, you know cable cable tv is
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:18.140]  In in decline. I think that's not you know, controversial to say that right cable tv is in decline, but cable networks are still
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:21.180]  That you know the ones that are doing well are still doing well
[02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:26.780]  I think that what we've seen is we I just think we've hit peak cable like cables. Yeah peak is behind it
[02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:28.540]  And it'll be here for a long time to come
[02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:34.860]  You know decades to come I think I don't I don't think that the end is going to come quickly because I think there's too
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.580]  Many people, you know, and you know, let's just face it
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:42.620]  It skews older like my parents are not going to cut off their cable and switch to getting everything through the internet
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:50.380]  But it's you know, it's no secret that there's an awful lot of people in their 20s and especially their early 20s who've never
[02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:57.340]  Who've never you know, never called a cable company and said come hook me up for you know cable tv and it probably never will
[02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:05.900]  That they just obtain their content legally or illegally through other means but it's all ones and zeros for them
[02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:08.780]  um
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:14.540]  Yeah, and I think you make a good point I think with these with the content with the negotiating with the studios and the tv networks
[02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:20.640]  It's like apple having become the gargantuan industry titan that it is when it comes to manufacturing
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:24.620]  Physical things it's been a nothing but a tremendous advantage, you know
[02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:29.980]  the rich getting richer and that they have these economies of scale where they can corner the market on
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:34.460]  Components and that they have these state-of-the-art, you know, they they can drill
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:39.500]  Single pieces of aluminum into these shapes that no other company has the ability to do
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:43.660]  Um, you know they're and they're doing it with steel now with the apple watch right like they're making
[02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:50.380]  They're doing things with steel for with apple watch that are just unprecedented for the mass market consumer market
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.820]  When it comes to the rights for these things though
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:59.740]  I think the bigger apple gets the harder it is for them because the more wary all these other companies are
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:03.820]  You know that like you said like the music industry is sort of like whoa
[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:06.540]  How'd we end up giving these people so much control over the music industry?
[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:12.540]  Nobody is going to make that mistake now with movies and tv like nobody is going to go into a negotiation with eddie q
[02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.420]  And not, you know have their hand on their wallet
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:22.060]  Right, right and you can tell when when disney and abc are supposedly, you know, the ones
[02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:26.700]  the also not just jumping on it, uh, and even though
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:30.620]  Steve and his his family is so involved. Uh,
[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:33.180]  that you know that there's
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:39.500]  Actual resistance is usually disney was the one that that jumped on first for a lot of the initiative
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:44.060]  Yeah, I think like abc had their tv shows for sale before anybody else
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:49.820]  Yeah, like before nbc and cbs at least it was like abc and a bunch of like cable networks and and stuff like that
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:55.020]  Anything else on your mind before we wrap up? I think that's good. All right, i've got one thing
[02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:58.060]  I know i've waited till I I promised last week on the show
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:13:03.580]  The the live version of the talk show i'm going to give first crack to people who've who listened to the show
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:08.620]  I'm, not going to post it on during fireball until uh sometime after the show's aired and you know
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:12.780]  Look, you had to go through. I don't know how long this show was. How long was this show?
[02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:16.780]  It was at least an hour. We'll find out. Yeah. Yeah, it was at least an hour
[02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:18.780]  So you've waited through at least an hour
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:22.380]  Uh, and now here's where you can go if you want to come you're going to be in san francisco
[02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:24.380]  So the last couple years i've done it the same way
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:30.060]  Wwdc week i'm there in san francisco all week monday. You don't want to do it on monday monday is busy because that's the keynote day
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:33.900]  tuesday of wwdc week this year, that's uh
[02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:37.180]  june 9th
[02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:40.140]  Uh, I will be holding a live version of this podcast
[02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:47.100]  At mezzanine at I think it's 444 jesse street right across from blue bottle coffee
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:51.260]  A great location just a few blocks two three blocks from mezzanine
[02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:57.420]  Uh, great location just a few blocks two three blocks away from moscone right in the middle of where all the hotels are six o'clock
[02:13:57.740 --> 02:13:59.740]  to nine o'clock
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.780]  uh
[02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:04.640]  At mezzanine great event. We've been there. This will be our third year at mezzanine
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:10.140]  We're gonna have an open bar. We're gonna have somebody's gonna I forget who's gonna sponsor
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:13.980]  We have a bunch of sponsors for it, but somebody's gonna sponsor the bar so you don't have to worry about it
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:16.220]  The only downside to the open bar
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:22.060]  Is that it therefore requires, uh, you have to be 21 or over to come to the show which sucks for anybody
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:24.620]  Who's 20 years old or whatever? So bring id
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:28.460]  But you're going to need tickets too and it's sold out the last couple years
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:32.300]  So here is where you can go you get a heads up on getting a ticket
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.380]  Go to
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.380]  tito that's
[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:38.140]  ti.to
[02:14:38.140 --> 02:14:40.140]  ti.to
[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:41.660]  daring fireball
[02:14:41.660 --> 02:14:42.940]  and
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:47.100]  You can buy a ticket there for uh, twenty five dollars and that'll get you into the show
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:54.140]  Remember to bring id I think that the confirmation will remind you to bring id and it'll be tuesday. June 9th at uh at mezzanine
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.500]  You going to wdc this year dan i'm not
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:00.220]  That's a shame
[02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:04.380]  I need to yeah, I haven't gone i've only gone twice maybe
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:08.780]  Some day maybe next year i'll go I don't know
[02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:12.060]  Here's the thing. So I just started this. Uh,
[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:15.580]  By the way, you haven't told people how to get tickets yet. So don't forget to do that
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:17.420]  No, I did. I said go to tito.com
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:21.660]  Oh fireball. Oh, yeah, ti.to. All right. I wasn't listening
[02:15:23.020 --> 02:15:28.060]  No, I did say all right. Ti.to slash during fireball. All right, it sounded weird. So I didn't
[02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:35.820]  Now tito is the uh, it's a ticketing system created by the the the geniuses, uh behind the wool conference
[02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:40.140]  Oh nice. All right. It's a and in my opinion. It's a really great. It's great for me
[02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:42.300]  It was great for me setting it up and it's really great
[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:45.340]  and it gives you like all sorts of cool stuff like you get uh
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:49.820]  You buy a ticket and then you get a little thing in your email that you can put in your passbook
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:51.340]  And then when you show up at the show
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.780]  You don't have to have a ticket you just open up your passbook and and it will scan you right in
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:59.980]  I totally used that passbook on the apple watch to buy starbucks yesterday
[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:03.580]  And I got a very funny look
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:07.100]  Have you used apple pay? Oh, yeah every day, but I do it through my shirt
[02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:12.220]  So no one even knows what i'm doing. I just kind of rub my sleeve up against the whole foods, uh
[02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:15.340]  Point of sale and it pays for my food. So that's cool
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:19.820]  But you know with the passbook, it's you're scanning a barcode. So there's a very
[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:24.060]  Kind of awkward positioning of your arm over there reader
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:29.180]  Uh, it was weird, but it worked it was cool. I don't know whatever i'm not ashamed at this point
[02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:35.020]  Uh, i'm used to I I haven't had a google glass moment where i'm like, oh man, what am I wearing?
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:39.420]  You know, even with short sleeves, so I think i'm over it. I think we're cool with that
[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:43.340]  So we're about three weeks out from wwc. Yeah, you can get your tickets now
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:47.180]  ti.to tito t-i-t-t-i-t-o
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:54.620]  Slash during fireball and I I want to thank uh our sponsors our sponsors this week are square space fracture igloo

[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:48.380]  Oh, really? It's still there. I had to go through a little bit of uh,
[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.740]  Something to get it to get it right, but uh, it's there
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:54.460]  I thought you were joking. No, man
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:18:00.140]  Well, that's great. That's a wrap and uh, you know, we've got there's a couple more shows in between now and the live show
[02:18:00.140 --> 02:18:04.620]  but anyway, this will give everybody who listens a heads up to get tickets before uh,
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:17.820]  Before the masses who read the website get a crack at it
