[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  Are you a Sopranos fan?
[00:02.600 --> 00:03.600]  Yeah.
[00:03.600 --> 00:04.600]  Love it.
[00:04.600 --> 00:06.720]  I can't help but think that you were.
[00:06.720 --> 00:09.640]  So Amy and I, we never re-watched it.
[00:09.640 --> 00:20.400]  We watched it live when it was on, which I think was circa 1999 to 2006.
[00:20.400 --> 00:25.920]  Everybody knows that it started before 9-11 because two or three seasons it had the Twin
[00:25.920 --> 00:30.040]  Towers and the opening credits, and then it of course didn't.
[00:30.040 --> 00:39.320]  I have to say, we just got done two nights ago, and I have to say, it was one of those
[00:39.320 --> 00:43.360]  things where we didn't re-watch it, not because we didn't want to, but because I insisted
[00:43.360 --> 00:49.160]  on putting it off as long as possible to delay the gratification.
[00:49.160 --> 00:52.360]  And I have to say, it was so much better than I remember.
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.480]  I always thought it might be my favorite show of all time, and almost certainly would have
[00:56.480 --> 00:59.560]  been my answer to what's the best show of all time.
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.780]  But it's so much better and so much more enjoyable than I remembered.
[01:03.780 --> 01:04.780]  It's stunning.
[01:04.780 --> 01:07.640]  Yeah, I've only seen it once as well.
[01:07.640 --> 01:13.340]  I watched it in real time, but I started, I think, I didn't get HBO until the second
[01:13.340 --> 01:17.840]  or third season, so I had some catching up to do, so I got to binge it a little bit.
[01:17.840 --> 01:23.040]  And that was fun in the old west of the internet, we had to try to find copies of the earlier
[01:23.040 --> 01:26.540]  seasons before they were out on DVD.
[01:26.540 --> 01:31.440]  And when the series was over, I essentially declared it my favorite TV show of all time,
[01:31.440 --> 01:36.440]  but that was a long time ago, and I've always kind of, not dreaded re-watching it, but wondered
[01:36.440 --> 01:40.820]  if I re-watch it, it's probably not going to be your favorite show of all time again.
[01:40.820 --> 01:46.160]  Maybe you just felt that way after you watched it, because I really liked the ending, and
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.160]  I thought it was great.
[01:47.160 --> 01:50.760]  And there's so much great TV has come since then that surely it probably doesn't hold
[01:50.760 --> 01:51.760]  up.
[01:51.760 --> 01:56.000]  So I haven't re-watched it just because I'm letting it live in my memory as my kind of
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.080]  default answer of, oh, if you had to pick your favorite TV show of all time, what would
[01:59.080 --> 02:00.880]  it be?
[02:00.880 --> 02:03.920]  And there's favorite versus best, right?
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.200]  For many reasons, you know, I'm coming from the New York metro area or being Italian American,
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.920]  there's lots of things that make this show in my wheelhouse, and I love these type of
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.080]  movies, you know, Godfather, Goodfellas, all that stuff, anyway.
[02:16.080 --> 02:20.640]  There's lots of things that make me predisposed to love it independent of its quality, but
[02:20.640 --> 02:22.560]  also the quality is very good.
[02:22.560 --> 02:24.040]  So I haven't re-watched it.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.160]  I don't know if I'm saving it for my retirement or something, because it's more of an investment
[02:28.160 --> 02:31.360]  than re-watching The Godfather, which I've done many, many times, but I will eventually
[02:31.360 --> 02:32.360]  re-watch it.
[02:32.360 --> 02:38.240]  This, that, see, this is where you're in my Venn diagrams overlap, and when they do overlap,
[02:38.240 --> 02:44.120]  they overlap so completely, you know, and then there's parts that they're like diametrically
[02:44.120 --> 02:45.120]  opposed.
[02:45.120 --> 02:48.880]  I almost feel like I insulted you by asking you if you enjoyed The Sopranos, because I
[02:48.880 --> 02:54.780]  was so sure that you would, for all the reasons you said, even if you had been born in California,
[02:54.780 --> 02:56.560]  you know, I think you would have enjoyed it.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.560]  God forbid.
[02:57.560 --> 02:58.560]  Right.
[02:58.560 --> 03:01.720]  But I, you know, the fact that you are from New York and you are Italian American, and
[03:01.720 --> 03:05.800]  I know that, I happen to know because you and I have talked about it, I know you enjoy
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.720]  The Godfather and Goodfellas, you know, how could you not like The Sopranos?
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.840]  But I never know when you and I are going to disagree on something, but your reservations
[03:13.840 --> 03:22.200]  at rewatching it echo my own years, many years long procrastination of, of rewatching it.
[03:22.200 --> 03:26.560]  And I have to say it held up so much better than I expected.
[03:26.560 --> 03:27.560]  It's remarkable.
[03:27.560 --> 03:34.680]  Like, the one thing that I didn't anticipate was, because the thing I remember was it was
[03:34.680 --> 03:40.560]  the first show, maybe the first show period, but it's certainly the first show I knew where
[03:40.560 --> 03:50.520]  they went way off an annual schedule, where towards the end, the gap between seasons grew,
[03:50.520 --> 03:55.240]  I don't want to say exponentially, but sort of exponentially, semi almost exponentially,
[03:55.240 --> 04:00.320]  like there were, it was like two years between, like some of the seasons.
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.500]  And they, one of the things that I actually like it about the show, but they never did
[04:05.500 --> 04:11.360]  the, okay, the show opens up previously on The Sopranos, and here's like a couple of
[04:11.360 --> 04:17.440]  clips from last week to refresh you, and here's some clips from two years ago to remind you
[04:17.440 --> 04:20.120]  about this thing that's going to happen on this show.
[04:20.120 --> 04:21.120]  They didn't do that.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.360]  They've never done that.
[04:22.360 --> 04:25.720]  So it's like, you remembered what you remember.
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.360]  And I got so much more out of it, binging the whole thing straight through six seasons,
[04:31.360 --> 04:34.320]  because I could keep it all in my mind.
[04:34.320 --> 04:37.840]  There was so much that I missed the first time, because it was like, I just forgot about,
[04:37.840 --> 04:40.600]  oh, that's that guy from like two seasons ago.
[04:40.600 --> 04:43.880]  Yeah, there's a lot of characters in that show.
[04:43.880 --> 04:47.720]  Like, you know, it's so much not, rewatching a TV show is so much more of a commitment.
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.080]  You picked a good time to do it, you know, being trapped inside and everything.
[04:52.080 --> 04:56.000]  But rewatching a movie, you can hold the whole thing in your head and keep it all together.
[04:56.000 --> 04:58.180]  But I think that that is the advantage of the rewatch.
[04:58.180 --> 05:02.920]  If you really can jam it all in, you have a much larger portion of the show and sort
[05:02.920 --> 05:07.000]  of the working set of your brain's memory lets you appreciate all the details more.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  Well, and the other thing that's so obvious is that, you know, it's not like they took
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.920]  these gaps between seasons because they were the creators of the show were goofing around.
[05:15.920 --> 05:21.800]  It was, you know, it was so rich that it took them a long time to write it, you know.
[05:21.800 --> 05:28.980]  And it's so, I just forgot that like in between seasons as a viewer, it felt like there's
[05:28.980 --> 05:33.240]  a gap, whereas when you binge it, you're like, oh, these people who made the show, this is
[05:33.240 --> 05:42.020]  like this is like one big novel that plays straight through over seven years, very naturally.
[05:42.020 --> 05:43.020]  It's so impressive.
[05:43.020 --> 05:47.400]  I'm just blown away and I need to talk to somebody about it.
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.800]  The worst moment was two, three nights ago, where we had three episodes to go.
[05:52.800 --> 05:54.520]  We watched two.
[05:54.520 --> 06:00.520]  So the third to last and then the second to last, as they call it, the penultimate.
[06:00.520 --> 06:04.380]  And it didn't feel right to keep going right through to the finale.
[06:04.380 --> 06:05.380]  And Amy was tired.
[06:05.380 --> 06:09.760]  She gets a little bit tired before I do at night, you know, and it felt disrespectful
[06:09.760 --> 06:10.760]  to the finale.
[06:10.760 --> 06:12.280]  So you got to save it.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.640]  But I wasn't that tired.
[06:14.640 --> 06:18.560]  And the second to last episode leaves you so up in the air.
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.800]  It was like the closest I've come to insomnia in years.
[06:21.800 --> 06:26.960]  Like I just couldn't, I was just laying in bed reading books on my iPad, like could not
[06:26.960 --> 06:32.240]  sleep because I didn't remember everything that happened in the finale.
[06:32.240 --> 06:37.080]  And I knew it was just sitting there waiting, waiting for us to watch.
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.280]  So how did you handle the, was it always 16 by 9?
[06:40.280 --> 06:41.280]  I forget.
[06:41.280 --> 06:44.560]  It's the one that they had to, they had to redo the framing for, right?
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.480]  I think they had to redo The Sopranos too.
[06:46.480 --> 06:47.840]  I didn't notice.
[06:47.840 --> 06:49.640]  Everything looked good in 16 to 9.
[06:49.640 --> 06:54.620]  They must have gone back to the original, instead of just cropping, they must have gone
[06:54.620 --> 07:00.000]  back to the film because I don't think it was even high def in 1999.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Yeah.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.960]  No, I remember when it switched to high def.
[07:02.960 --> 07:06.240]  I saw this whole big thing about how they did the wire because the wire, they did actually
[07:06.240 --> 07:12.520]  shoot like the, you know, the, the four by three had a lot more information in it than
[07:12.520 --> 07:14.720]  was available in the 16 by nine.
[07:14.720 --> 07:19.560]  And so they, you know, they got, what's his name, David Simon or whatever the guy who
[07:19.560 --> 07:25.120]  did the wire was involved in the, in, in attempting to make a good HD version of it.
[07:25.120 --> 07:28.520]  And I think they did the best job possible, but it's still kind of weird when these shows
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.360]  span the standard def and high def eras, you know?
[07:32.360 --> 07:33.360]  Yeah.
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.560]  I, it's the first few, I would say they did a very good job and it was even to me, not
[07:38.560 --> 07:39.560]  noticeable.
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.560]  And I don't remember ever seeing anything cropped out that looked bad.
[07:42.560 --> 07:43.560]  I don't know.
[07:43.560 --> 07:48.000]  I don't know if they cropped out or if they had stuff that they could go wider.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.520]  I'm not quite sure I didn't, I never, I didn't look at it, but it, it stood up to me.
[07:53.520 --> 07:57.680]  You can kind of see though, it was the thing that made was that in the, especially the
[07:57.680 --> 08:04.600]  first season, there were some shots in some scenes and it wasn't a cropping issue.
[08:04.600 --> 08:10.960]  It was like, uh, it, it was like a, a noise issue.
[08:10.960 --> 08:17.960]  Like somehow when they went back to it, there were some shots that were in low light that
[08:17.960 --> 08:22.360]  once they blew it up to high, like maybe they didn't have the film.
[08:22.360 --> 08:26.760]  That's what I'm thinking is maybe they didn't have the film for those shots and had to blow
[08:26.760 --> 08:30.640]  it up from the standard def version.
[08:30.640 --> 08:35.400]  There were a couple of shots, even Amy commented on it and she's not one to comment on something
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.720]  technical like that, but only in the first season.
[08:38.720 --> 08:39.720]  Yeah.
[08:39.720 --> 08:44.920]  It almost makes me, uh, it's kind of like playing old video games on like modern equipment.
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.720]  I wonder if it would have been better to like, to watch the first season on a standard F
[08:48.720 --> 08:51.240]  television or can we just not go back to that anymore?
[08:51.240 --> 08:56.120]  No, I think it was, it holds up and it, and it makes it seem more seamless.
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.880]  It's like a more seamless experience to go straight through.
[08:58.880 --> 08:59.880]  Yeah.
[08:59.880 --> 09:00.880]  You just watch it on HBO.
[09:00.880 --> 09:01.880]  No.
[09:01.880 --> 09:02.880]  Uh, yeah.
[09:02.880 --> 09:03.880]  HBO max.
[09:03.880 --> 09:04.880]  Yeah.
[09:04.880 --> 09:05.880]  Yeah.
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.880]  That's what they call it.
[09:06.880 --> 09:07.880]  As if that's a thing.
[09:07.880 --> 09:08.880]  Well, you know what?
[09:08.880 --> 09:09.880]  It really annoyed me.
[09:09.880 --> 09:11.320]  What really, here's another thing.
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.380]  This is true.
[09:12.380 --> 09:17.600]  And I remember always enjoying the opening credits and theme song of the sopranos.
[09:17.600 --> 09:19.240]  So we binged the whole thing.
[09:19.240 --> 09:26.360]  I don't know how many episodes it was at least 13 episodes, the season, you know, times six
[09:26.360 --> 09:30.320]  60 plus 18, 78.
[09:30.320 --> 09:36.520]  But I think some of the seasons had more episodes, uh, I don't know, 70 to seven, 70 to 80 episodes.
[09:36.520 --> 09:38.840]  We watched the theme to every single one.
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.920]  Even when we watched like three in a night, we w we'd never skipped the opening credits
[09:43.920 --> 09:49.320]  and Amy skips the credits to everything.
[09:49.320 --> 09:53.400]  It's such a good, it's such a good theme song and such a good opening credit.
[09:53.400 --> 09:56.880]  And they never changed the credit or credits over the seven years.
[09:56.880 --> 09:57.880]  Yeah.
[09:57.880 --> 09:59.400]  It's good credit.
[09:59.400 --> 10:00.400]  So they're kind of long.
[10:00.400 --> 10:04.260]  I mean, I guess if you're getting settled into watch, it's fine, but yeah, it's like
[10:04.260 --> 10:05.260]  a thing.
[10:05.260 --> 10:06.260]  I don't know.
[10:06.260 --> 10:07.260]  And now I'm back on it.
[10:07.260 --> 10:14.640]  The other thing too, is that I associate when I hear the HBO static fanfare, I still for
[10:14.640 --> 10:20.160]  years and years afterwards, as soon as I see any HBO show, I expect the Sopranos theme
[10:20.160 --> 10:23.000]  song to, to immediately kick in.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.080]  And the only HBO show that rivaled that in terms of setting my ears expectation for what
[10:29.080 --> 10:34.200]  to expect after the HBO static was a Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.200]  Yeah.
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.040]  Yeah, Sopranos is still the one for me too, but it's shifting a little bit over time.
[10:40.040 --> 10:41.440]  I do skip the intro.
[10:41.440 --> 10:46.600]  One show that I've watched recently, I realized I watched almost all of season one and I realized
[10:46.600 --> 10:49.400]  I'm not skipping the intro on this show.
[10:49.400 --> 10:54.400]  It was the TV adaptation, not an adaptation, the TV version of Snowpiercer.
[10:54.400 --> 10:55.480]  Here's the movie Snowpiercer.
[10:55.480 --> 11:01.360]  I did see the movie Snowpiercer and I would like to watch the TV version, but I feel like
[11:01.360 --> 11:04.200]  it might be a tough sell on the wife.
[11:04.200 --> 11:05.880]  I mean, it's not, it's not the movie.
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.360]  It's a, it's, it's a, you know, inspired by the ridiculous premise of the movie.
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.000]  Here's the TV show with different characters and you know, anyway.
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.080]  And in that they do this thing, the show is pretty straightforward, but they do this stylized
[11:19.080 --> 11:24.300]  thing where the, like the show starts without any credits, you're just right in it.
[11:24.300 --> 11:30.200]  And they have some small, a couple of scenes, like it's usually from one character's point
[11:30.200 --> 11:33.540]  of view and that character is narrating.
[11:33.540 --> 11:38.520]  So there's, you know, I don't know, it's like 60, 90 seconds, two minutes of stuff where
[11:38.520 --> 11:44.040]  a character is narrating, saying something about Snowpiercer and then whatever it is,
[11:44.040 --> 11:47.000]  like it's just, you could have taken that scene and put it into the middle of any episode
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  because it fits perfectly.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.640]  It's in the style of the show.
[11:49.640 --> 11:55.500]  But then to the very end of that narration, the character always says, has some sort of
[11:55.500 --> 11:56.500]  wrap up phrase.
[11:56.500 --> 12:01.000]  They're like, well, that's what it's like on Snowpiercer or, you know, or, or the such
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.740]  as the way on Snowpiercer or, you know, something, something on Snowpiercer, 1001 cars long.
[12:08.740 --> 12:13.520]  So they say, and blah, blah, blah on Snowpiercer, 1001 cars long, and they cut from that into
[12:13.520 --> 12:20.340]  the credits, the quote unquote credits, which ties in with the, the sort of tagline 1001
[12:20.340 --> 12:21.340]  cars long.
[12:21.340 --> 12:28.780]  Then they show a very brief, like musical thing that has diagrams of the train and whatever.
[12:28.780 --> 12:31.060]  And it's before you know it, you're out of it.
[12:31.060 --> 12:35.900]  And I think because of the sort of the, the, the routine, this, the tradition of always
[12:35.900 --> 12:41.300]  saying something, something on Snowpiercer or 1001 cars long leading into the credits,
[12:41.300 --> 12:45.700]  it makes it seem like it's like, you know, someone doing shaving a haircut and not finishing
[12:45.700 --> 12:46.700]  it.
[12:46.700 --> 12:47.700]  Right.
[12:47.700 --> 12:50.540]  You have to play through the credits and they're so short.
[12:50.540 --> 12:53.860]  Trying to skip them would be like trying to cut someone off in the middle of a sentence.
[12:53.860 --> 12:55.420]  It doesn't make any sense.
[12:55.420 --> 12:57.700]  And I didn't realize that I didn't realize I was watching it.
[12:57.700 --> 13:00.340]  I didn't realize I was not skipping the credits until like literally three quarters of the
[13:00.340 --> 13:01.340]  way through the first season.
[13:01.340 --> 13:03.700]  I said, this show has found a way to make me watch the credits.
[13:03.700 --> 13:05.340]  I didn't even realize I was doing it.
[13:05.340 --> 13:08.060]  So I give that show props for that reason alone.
[13:08.060 --> 13:10.540]  Uh, Snowpiercer.
[13:10.540 --> 13:14.460]  So the gimmick, what was it, a novel originally?
[13:14.460 --> 13:15.460]  What's the source material?
[13:15.460 --> 13:16.980]  Was it a graphic novel?
[13:16.980 --> 13:19.700]  Uh, yeah, maybe a French comic or something.
[13:19.700 --> 13:21.540]  I have no idea what the actual origins are.
[13:21.540 --> 13:24.000]  I first saw it when it was the movie.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.900]  But I think a bunch of people on Twitter told me it was like a French comic or something
[13:27.900 --> 13:28.900]  like that.
[13:28.900 --> 13:34.380]  It's a, it's a great premise because it, it passes the sniff test of it doesn't even try
[13:34.380 --> 13:36.060]  to be vaguely plausible.
[13:36.060 --> 13:37.820]  It doesn't make, it doesn't make any sense.
[13:37.820 --> 13:38.820]  Yeah.
[13:38.820 --> 13:39.820]  It's like the fifth element, right?
[13:39.820 --> 13:46.460]  Like the fifth element is like so dumb and nonsensical and tries to make some sense,
[13:46.460 --> 13:53.400]  but it then just falls back and it's like, but Snowpiercer is like, I don't remember
[13:53.400 --> 13:55.100]  what the movie tried to do.
[13:55.100 --> 13:58.220]  Maybe the movie was just trying to kind of be like vague or like the movie.
[13:58.220 --> 14:02.260]  I think the movie's premise, the idea was there's stuff that you don't know viewer.
[14:02.260 --> 14:05.700]  So maybe if there were, if you knew more as a viewer, this would all make sense, but we're
[14:05.700 --> 14:07.000]  just not going to tell you.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.300]  But the television show is sort of obstinately insistent that, oh no viewer, you have all
[14:12.300 --> 14:13.300]  the information.
[14:13.300 --> 14:16.540]  No, this doesn't actually make sense, but just, we're going to put it right in your
[14:16.540 --> 14:23.380]  face and say like the television show repeatedly hinges on the nonsensical premise, right?
[14:23.380 --> 14:25.780]  That the train has to keep moving or they all die, right?
[14:25.780 --> 14:28.380]  Which doesn't make any sense in any way.
[14:28.380 --> 14:32.540]  And they don't try to explain it, but they're insistent that that is true and it factors
[14:32.540 --> 14:36.260]  into the plot a lot.
[14:36.260 --> 14:40.620]  But I think the thing that the movie was missing from the source material is the end.
[14:40.620 --> 14:45.220]  What makes the real premise so interesting is that the train is gigantic.
[14:45.220 --> 14:51.620]  Like you, I apparently, yeah, it's 10 mile long train with a thousand and one cars.
[14:51.620 --> 14:55.860]  Whereas in the movie, they only show you like, there's like four cars.
[14:55.860 --> 15:00.820]  There's like, I don't know, there's like the, the, the place where all the, the, the poor
[15:00.820 --> 15:07.740]  people are in the back coach, whatever they call it, there's the tail, there's the middle,
[15:07.740 --> 15:12.220]  and then there's the front and that's it because they only have two hours.
[15:12.220 --> 15:16.180]  And it's like, even on a TV show, like they, they show establishing shots of the train
[15:16.180 --> 15:20.260]  being humongous and long, but you know, they only can only make so many sets, right?
[15:20.260 --> 15:23.620]  And they also have it in a television show, since they have to sort of deal with this
[15:23.620 --> 15:28.940]  more often, they have a sort of a basement level in the train.
[15:28.940 --> 15:32.500]  And within the basement level is a little miniature train that goes from one end of
[15:32.500 --> 15:33.500]  the train to the other.
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.500]  Oh, I like that.
[15:35.500 --> 15:38.540]  Because how else are you going to get your characters from the, from the engine to the,
[15:38.540 --> 15:39.540]  to the tail?
[15:39.540 --> 15:40.540]  It's 10 miles.
[15:40.540 --> 15:42.300]  If they walk it, it'll take a really long time.
[15:42.300 --> 15:46.040]  So they got to go into, I figure what they call it, it's like the sub train or whatever.
[15:46.040 --> 15:49.620]  It takes long enough on the real world to sell it, to get to the car where you can buy
[15:49.620 --> 15:50.620]  a soda.
[15:50.620 --> 15:51.620]  Right.
[15:51.620 --> 15:52.620]  Yeah.
[15:52.620 --> 15:56.100]  So there's like the 10 sets they built for the show.
[15:56.100 --> 15:57.980]  And there's 10 miles of train.
[15:57.980 --> 16:00.900]  But each of the sets is like, you know, 20 yards long.
[16:00.900 --> 16:04.780]  But it is it's an interesting premise, because you can have this 10 mile long thing with
[16:04.780 --> 16:06.220]  thousands of people.
[16:06.220 --> 16:08.900]  But because it's a train, it's completely linear.
[16:08.900 --> 16:14.440]  You know, you can't just skip around, but I guess with this little mini train underneath,
[16:14.440 --> 16:15.440]  you can skip around.
[16:15.440 --> 16:18.300]  Yeah, because you kind of need that for plots, because if you really can't get from A to
[16:18.300 --> 16:22.060]  B without going through C, like it's the your the stories you can tell are very limited.
[16:22.060 --> 16:25.360]  And that's what the movie does is as well, you're going to get from the back to the front,
[16:25.360 --> 16:27.040]  you got to go through the cars, right.
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.700]  And this thing says, well, you can go under the cars, and then people in those cars won't
[16:29.700 --> 16:34.140]  see you because you're going under and, you know, but but but the main premise like that,
[16:34.140 --> 16:38.820]  you know, the every it's super cold on earth, and everyone's on this train, all right with
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.340]  you so far.
[16:40.340 --> 16:44.500]  And the train has to keep moving because if the train stops, then it'll run out of, you
[16:44.500 --> 16:47.900]  know, run out of heat, like so as to keep moving to produce heat.
[16:47.900 --> 16:52.500]  It's like that's not how thermodynamics works, like, you know, the effort you're taking to
[16:52.500 --> 16:54.780]  move this train could be used to keep people warm.
[16:54.780 --> 16:59.760]  But no, the television show says, if this train stops, then there will be no more heat
[16:59.760 --> 17:00.760]  there.
[17:00.760 --> 17:01.760]  And they're producing midichlorians.
[17:01.760 --> 17:02.760]  John.
[17:02.760 --> 17:06.060]  Yeah, like just the faster the train goes, the more the batteries get charged.
[17:06.060 --> 17:07.060]  Right?
[17:07.060 --> 17:08.060]  Is that how it works?
[17:08.060 --> 17:10.420]  If only electric cars work that way.
[17:10.420 --> 17:12.980]  The more you drive them, the more the battery gets charged.
[17:12.980 --> 17:16.580]  All right, let me take a break.
[17:16.580 --> 17:18.180]  Thank our first sponsor.
[17:18.180 --> 17:21.020]  It's our good friends at Mack Weldon.
[17:21.020 --> 17:24.300]  I don't know why they're telling me they want me to tell you about their spring essentials.
[17:24.300 --> 17:25.660]  It doesn't feel like spring here.
[17:25.660 --> 17:27.380]  I was shoveling snow.
[17:27.380 --> 17:29.380]  But they've got all sorts of stuff coming up.
[17:29.380 --> 17:30.460]  Spring is coming.
[17:30.460 --> 17:36.700]  They've got a new set of stealth boxer briefs that deliver enhanced breathability and support.
[17:36.700 --> 17:40.380]  Perfect for everyday wear or layered underneath your workout gear.
[17:40.380 --> 17:45.960]  And for sweatpants you can wear outside without feeling like you're a lazy person wearing
[17:45.960 --> 17:46.960]  sweatpants.
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.940]  Check out their new ace line.
[17:48.940 --> 17:50.660]  They've got these ace sweatpants.
[17:50.660 --> 17:51.860]  I don't have a pair of these.
[17:51.860 --> 17:52.940]  My son does though.
[17:52.940 --> 17:53.940]  He loves them.
[17:53.940 --> 17:55.380]  Wears them all the time.
[17:55.380 --> 17:56.940]  Looks very, very dapper in them.
[17:56.940 --> 17:59.140]  I agreed that they do not look like sweatpants.
[17:59.140 --> 18:01.920]  They look like nice pants, like nice athletic pants.
[18:01.920 --> 18:02.920]  Very nice.
[18:02.920 --> 18:03.920]  They're so nice.
[18:03.920 --> 18:06.900]  I actually ordered a pair before I even knew that this sponsor read was going to have me
[18:06.900 --> 18:07.900]  tell you about them.
[18:07.900 --> 18:08.900]  I'm going to have sweatpants.
[18:08.900 --> 18:11.060]  I haven't had sweatpants in years.
[18:11.060 --> 18:16.260]  Jack Weldon sells all sorts of other men's essentials, socks, shirts, hoodies, underwear,
[18:16.260 --> 18:19.780]  polo shirts, active shorts, all sorts of stuff.
[18:19.780 --> 18:20.780]  It's all great.
[18:20.780 --> 18:21.780]  I have lots of it.
[18:21.780 --> 18:22.780]  I love it.
[18:22.780 --> 18:26.320]  I'm wearing one of their hoodies right now as part of my multilayering for the freezing
[18:26.320 --> 18:27.320]  cold here.
[18:27.320 --> 18:30.100]  I need a snow piercer.
[18:30.100 --> 18:31.700]  You can look great, feel great.
[18:31.700 --> 18:33.940]  They've got a great loyalty program.
[18:33.940 --> 18:34.940]  You don't have to do anything.
[18:34.940 --> 18:35.940]  You just give them...
[18:35.940 --> 18:39.360]  When you buy stuff, you give them your email address so they can notify you.
[18:39.360 --> 18:44.500]  They're already in the club, and level one, you get free shipping for life, and level
[18:44.500 --> 18:48.280]  two, you get there by just spending $200 total.
[18:48.280 --> 18:53.640]  Not like one order, but when you get to 200 bucks, then you get 20% off every order for
[18:53.640 --> 18:54.640]  the next year.
[18:54.640 --> 18:55.840]  It's a great deal.
[18:55.840 --> 18:56.840]  You don't have to do anything.
[18:56.840 --> 19:01.280]  You just buy stuff, you get in a loyalty program, and you get free shipping, and then you start
[19:01.280 --> 19:03.820]  getting 20% off everything you order.
[19:03.820 --> 19:07.660]  They want you to be comfortable, so if you do not like your first pair of underwear that
[19:07.660 --> 19:12.200]  you get from them, you can keep them, and they will still refund you.
[19:12.200 --> 19:13.200]  No questions asked.
[19:13.200 --> 19:16.040]  They do not want the underwear back.
[19:16.040 --> 19:19.400]  Just keep it, but that's how confident they are that you're going to like it.
[19:19.400 --> 19:27.720]  Anyway, you can start with 20% off your first order by going to mackweldon, M-A-C-K-W-E-L-D-O-N.com

[19:33.160 --> 19:34.700]  will save 20% off.
[19:34.700 --> 19:37.900]  My thanks to Mack Weldon for reinventing men's basics.
[19:37.900 --> 19:41.860]  Go to mackweldon.com slash talk show.
[19:41.860 --> 19:43.300]  I've got those sweatpants.
[19:43.300 --> 19:46.320]  How are you doing all this COVID times without wearing sweatpants?
[19:46.320 --> 19:47.780]  Are you wearing jeans in your house?
[19:47.780 --> 19:50.280]  I wear jeans every day.
[19:50.280 --> 19:51.280]  That's madness.
[19:51.280 --> 19:52.280]  I know.
[19:52.280 --> 19:53.280]  Sweatpants is the outfit of the day.
[19:53.280 --> 19:54.280]  That's why I ordered them.
[19:54.280 --> 19:58.560]  I honest to God, you think I'm making this up, but you know me.
[19:58.560 --> 19:59.560]  You know me.
[19:59.560 --> 20:03.120]  I don't do homework before I do these podcasts, and at least of all, I don't really look at
[20:03.120 --> 20:04.520]  the sponsor read stuff.
[20:04.520 --> 20:05.520]  I was blown away.
[20:05.520 --> 20:09.720]  I looked at this Mack Weldon thing five minutes before we started recording, and I was like,
[20:09.720 --> 20:12.240]  holy crap, I just ordered these sweatpants the other day.
[20:12.240 --> 20:16.160]  Like literally, and they ship stuff fast too.
[20:16.160 --> 20:17.160]  It might've been yesterday.
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.160]  I don't know.
[20:18.160 --> 20:19.160]  I lose track of days.
[20:19.160 --> 20:22.000]  I think it was yesterday because I knew I didn't have the Sopranos to look forward
[20:22.000 --> 20:25.080]  to, so I ordered.
[20:25.080 --> 20:28.720]  So you're finally going to have some comfortable sweatpants just as like the vaccine is rolling
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.920]  out across the country.
[20:29.920 --> 20:31.520]  You're way behind on this.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.520]  Exactly.
[20:32.520 --> 20:34.160]  I had to buy new jeans too.
[20:34.160 --> 20:37.400]  I've worn out my jeans just by sitting.
[20:37.400 --> 20:38.400]  It's really depressing.
[20:38.400 --> 20:39.400]  Yeah.
[20:39.400 --> 20:43.720]  So it's the rough and tumble nature of your work that really wears through your clothes
[20:43.720 --> 20:44.720]  quickly.
[20:44.720 --> 20:45.720]  You know what?
[20:45.720 --> 20:46.720]  I got injured yesterday.
[20:46.720 --> 20:48.600]  It's a good thing I'm podcasting today.
[20:48.600 --> 20:49.600]  I have hand problems.
[20:49.600 --> 20:53.720]  I got two blisters on my left hand from shoveling snow.
[20:53.720 --> 20:54.720]  Do you...
[20:54.720 --> 20:57.840]  You got city hands, Mr. Gruber.
[20:57.840 --> 20:59.560]  Do you shovel the snow or do you have...
[20:59.560 --> 21:00.560]  I shovel it.
[21:00.560 --> 21:05.600]  I shovel it with my bare hands.
[21:05.600 --> 21:08.160]  Every time I do it, I think to myself, I need...
[21:08.160 --> 21:09.400]  You know what I need is one of those...
[21:09.400 --> 21:10.400]  I don't even know what you call it.
[21:10.400 --> 21:14.240]  I think it's a hoe, but it's not a shovel.
[21:14.240 --> 21:19.320]  It's a stick with a thing at the bottom so you can chop up the snow.
[21:19.320 --> 21:22.520]  Well, you got to shovel it when it's fresh.
[21:22.520 --> 21:25.960]  You can't let it just get all damp and crusty and frozen.
[21:25.960 --> 21:26.960]  Yeah.
[21:26.960 --> 21:27.960]  See, we can't do that.
[21:27.960 --> 21:30.880]  We live in the city and it's a busy pedestrian street.
[21:30.880 --> 21:36.160]  And so no matter how on the ball I am, it's already been sort of trampled by pedestrian
[21:36.160 --> 21:45.720]  traffic and that packs it down and it sort of turns it into an unshovelable, closer to
[21:45.720 --> 21:46.720]  ice than snow.
[21:46.720 --> 21:47.720]  Yeah.
[21:47.720 --> 21:51.000]  I remember dealing with that when it gets packed down.
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.180]  It happens less these days, but all the tools for breaking through that, the ones that really
[21:57.180 --> 21:59.120]  work well will also end up damaging the sidewalk.
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.520]  So, I mean, it's not your sidewalk.
[22:00.520 --> 22:03.160]  You probably don't care, but you also don't want your sidewalk all broken up in front
[22:03.160 --> 22:04.160]  of your house.
[22:04.160 --> 22:05.160]  So you got to be careful.
[22:05.160 --> 22:06.160]  Yeah.
[22:06.160 --> 22:07.440]  Actually, I don't know whose sidewalk it is.
[22:07.440 --> 22:08.440]  It might be mine.
[22:08.440 --> 22:09.500]  I might be on there.
[22:09.500 --> 22:10.500]  It's all of our sidewalk.
[22:10.500 --> 22:11.500]  Yeah.
[22:11.500 --> 22:15.640]  Well, I know this, if it did get damaged and I needed it fixed, I think I'd have to be
[22:15.640 --> 22:19.440]  the one to fix it because I don't think...
[22:19.440 --> 22:24.080]  Like I said, the city hasn't fixed that damn pothole with the buses run over in front of
[22:24.080 --> 22:25.080]  the house.
[22:25.080 --> 22:27.320]  I don't think it's a sidewalk either.
[22:27.320 --> 22:29.040]  Anyway, blisters on my hand.
[22:29.040 --> 22:30.200]  Can you believe it?
[22:30.200 --> 22:31.200]  I do.
[22:31.200 --> 22:32.200]  I do believe it.
[22:32.200 --> 22:33.200]  That's the...
[22:33.200 --> 22:37.240]  Too many years just cradling the mouse and typing on the keyboard.
[22:37.240 --> 22:39.800]  Not a lot of building up of calluses and that work.
[22:39.800 --> 22:40.800]  Yeah.
[22:40.800 --> 22:42.280]  And I gave up golf years ago.
[22:42.280 --> 22:46.560]  It's right on the spot where before I had a kid, I played golf.
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.400]  I'd have a bit of a callus there.
[22:51.400 --> 22:52.400]  We've had so...
[22:52.400 --> 22:53.400]  How much snow have you gotten?
[22:53.400 --> 22:58.240]  I mean, more snow this year than in a long time.
[22:58.240 --> 22:59.320]  I don't mean to complain.
[22:59.320 --> 23:03.560]  This sounds terrible because there's people in Texas who don't even have electricity and
[23:03.560 --> 23:06.840]  heat, but it's a bad winter.
[23:06.840 --> 23:10.360]  I mean, we have more snow this winter than last winter, but our last several winters
[23:10.360 --> 23:13.120]  have been incredibly mild in terms of snowfall.
[23:13.120 --> 23:17.320]  This one is still, I think, below average for us for snowfall, but it's not nothing.
[23:17.320 --> 23:18.320]  Yeah.
[23:18.320 --> 23:19.320]  Because you got...
[23:19.320 --> 23:23.360]  I got up there for two winters and that was enough for me.
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.640]  I mean, the one time we got so much snow, you couldn't even tell whose car was whose.
[23:26.640 --> 23:28.200]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[23:28.200 --> 23:29.200]  Yeah.
[23:29.200 --> 23:30.200]  I can't...
[23:30.200 --> 23:33.120]  I should write down what year that is because I'm already losing track of it.
[23:33.120 --> 23:37.640]  Like the record breaking year in Boston, we got like 150 inches of snow or something ridiculous
[23:37.640 --> 23:38.640]  like that.
[23:38.640 --> 23:39.640]  And it was...
[23:39.640 --> 23:40.640]  It wasn't that long ago.
[23:40.640 --> 23:43.840]  I want to say that it was like five years ago, but I'm so bad with time.
[23:43.840 --> 23:44.840]  It could have been 15.
[23:44.840 --> 23:50.680]  Somewhere between 15 and five years ago, our area had record breaking snowfall for the
[23:50.680 --> 23:51.680]  winter.
[23:51.680 --> 23:53.360]  It was like every single day, another foot of snow would fall.
[23:53.360 --> 23:54.960]  We were running out of places to put it.
[23:54.960 --> 23:57.840]  This is the good thing about having taken pictures of everything.
[23:57.840 --> 24:01.680]  I can actually go back in my photo library and just find the pictures of the ridiculous
[24:01.680 --> 24:06.720]  sort of Overlook Hotel, you know, in front of our house and say, oh yeah, that must have
[24:06.720 --> 24:07.720]  been the year.
[24:07.720 --> 24:11.720]  And then just look at the date on the picture.
[24:11.720 --> 24:14.840]  I do remember that being an issue when we lived up here.
[24:14.840 --> 24:19.960]  We lived in an apartment and I remember that it was an issue with the...
[24:19.960 --> 24:24.560]  They had the apartment complex would have a truck come through and plow the thing.
[24:24.560 --> 24:31.160]  But then by this time of the winter, it was an issue as to where to put the snow.
[24:31.160 --> 24:32.160]  We have like...
[24:32.160 --> 24:34.720]  So one of the big parking lots in the area, so we go for like walks with the dog and we
[24:34.720 --> 24:35.720]  go buy these parking lots.
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.080]  And it's one of those parking lots where they pile the snow, like the snow plows must come
[24:39.080 --> 24:41.880]  there and like dump it or pile it or whatever.
[24:41.880 --> 24:45.560]  And you know, we do that walk and it would be like springtime, it'd be like April or
[24:45.560 --> 24:48.660]  May and we'd be walking around and we'd be seeing that the snow pile still hasn't completely
[24:48.660 --> 24:52.600]  melted because it would be like five stories high and it would just get smaller and smaller
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.360]  and smaller as the spring wears on, smaller and smaller.
[24:55.360 --> 25:00.060]  And just as it gets smaller, of course, all of the dirt that was on the snow compresses
[25:00.060 --> 25:04.400]  until it becomes just like, it looks like a dirt pile, but it's actually snow and ice.
[25:04.400 --> 25:10.720]  Right, the amount of dirt that covers a five story mound of snow, when it gets down to
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.080]  one story, you've got like, it's like exponential though.
[25:15.080 --> 25:16.760]  It's not like five times the dirt.
[25:16.760 --> 25:20.600]  It's like five times pi times the dirt.
[25:20.600 --> 25:22.440]  Is that how math works?
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.080]  Yeah, I think so.
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.360]  Five pi cubed or something like that.
[25:28.360 --> 25:38.120]  All right, I want to get off the merry-go-round of current events and talk to you about the
[25:38.120 --> 25:40.120]  state of the Mac.
[25:40.120 --> 25:44.360]  And I feel like we haven't done this in a while.
[25:44.360 --> 25:46.200]  Here's my first question to you.
[25:46.200 --> 25:53.480]  Do you ever regret that you don't write the annual macOS reviews anymore?
[25:53.480 --> 25:57.520]  No, the way you phrased it, do I regret that I don't write them?
[25:57.520 --> 25:59.160]  No, I do not regret that.
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.600]  I regret that you don't write them.
[26:01.600 --> 26:07.840]  Now, you could phrase it a different way and say, do you ever regret that they haven't
[26:07.840 --> 26:10.320]  been written by you as in past tense?
[26:10.320 --> 26:11.320]  That's different.
[26:11.320 --> 26:13.640]  But do you ever regret that I don't write them?
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.080]  It's like, I was burned out on the writing process.
[26:17.080 --> 26:18.400]  I wouldn't want to go through that again.
[26:18.400 --> 26:19.680]  I did it for 15 years.
[26:19.680 --> 26:20.920]  That's long enough.
[26:20.920 --> 26:24.440]  But I did enjoy after having written them.
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.960]  And I also enjoyed knowing all the things that I was forced to learn by writing them.
[26:29.960 --> 26:34.480]  Because now, when I want to know something about macOS, I just got to go to the internet
[26:34.480 --> 26:38.680]  and Google for it instead of just knowing it, because I spent six months writing a review.
[26:38.680 --> 26:42.120]  And even when there'd be a section where you would think, oh, well, I know this, but then
[26:42.120 --> 26:44.780]  you start writing it, and then you realize you don't know it.
[26:44.780 --> 26:50.220]  And now you've got to spend an entire week learning about this new subsystem.
[26:50.220 --> 26:51.220]  That's why they took so long.
[26:51.220 --> 26:54.960]  And just constantly revising them, you'd know the facts because you'd be going over them
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.160]  again and again as every new build came out.
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.520]  But I was looking something up for ATP the other day.
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.520]  And I go back to my own reviews as a resource, because now I'm sold, I don't remember the
[27:07.520 --> 27:08.520]  crap anymore.
[27:08.520 --> 27:10.480]  So I go, I read my own reviews, and it's like someone else wrote them.
[27:10.480 --> 27:13.840]  It's like, oh, there's a lot of good information here about this topic.
[27:13.840 --> 27:15.120]  What was the last one you wrote?
[27:15.120 --> 27:19.320]  I'm not going to look it up, I don't even know that.
[27:19.320 --> 27:20.320]  Was it Yosemite?
[27:20.320 --> 27:21.320]  No.
[27:21.320 --> 27:22.320]  I don't know the names.
[27:22.320 --> 27:23.320]  I forget.
[27:23.320 --> 27:25.320]  I'm guessing it was 10.11.
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.320]  10.11.
[27:26.320 --> 27:29.640]  I can find out in a moment.
[27:29.640 --> 27:33.760]  It was April 2015.
[27:33.760 --> 27:34.760]  It was Yosemite.
[27:34.760 --> 27:36.760]  What's the number on that, though?
[27:36.760 --> 27:37.760]  10.10.
[27:37.760 --> 27:38.760]  10.10.
[27:38.760 --> 27:41.660]  All right, so I was off by one.
[27:41.660 --> 27:46.200]  What you're saying reminds me of the Mark Twain quip about the classics, and that the
[27:46.200 --> 27:52.360]  classics are the books that everybody wants to have read and no one wants to read.
[27:52.360 --> 27:54.520]  You're saying that's how you feel about your reviews?
[27:54.520 --> 28:01.420]  Well, no, I want to have written them, but the effort of writing them is very out of
[28:01.420 --> 28:06.780]  proportion to the enjoyment of having them already be written.
[28:06.780 --> 28:08.500]  Do you think it would have been harder?
[28:08.500 --> 28:15.720]  It probably would have, with their new, truly annual cadence.
[28:15.720 --> 28:22.480]  Because at least for much of the heyday of your writing those reviews, the schedule was
[28:22.480 --> 28:29.320]  sort of like the publication schedule of this podcast, Highly Irregular.
[28:29.320 --> 28:32.220]  Towards the end, it got like it is now.
[28:32.220 --> 28:37.720]  It got harder as it went on, because just look here, I'm looking at the dates.
[28:37.720 --> 28:42.320]  July, July, October, October, those are 2011, 12, 13, and 14.
[28:42.320 --> 28:47.640]  So they were basically on an annual cycle, give or take, for the last four releases I
[28:47.640 --> 28:48.640]  did.
[28:48.640 --> 28:52.740]  And they were doing the thing where I was doing the thing where I had to have the article
[28:52.740 --> 28:57.500]  up on day of release, with all the ebooks in the stores and all that other stuff.
[28:57.500 --> 28:59.580]  And so it was getting progressively harder.
[28:59.580 --> 29:02.900]  In the beginning, there was so much more leeway, sometimes I didn't even publish on release
[29:02.900 --> 29:03.900]  day.
[29:03.900 --> 29:09.080]  But yeah, the last four years were absolutely annual with just, you know, the annual in
[29:09.080 --> 29:11.900]  July, then they shifted to annual in October.
[29:11.900 --> 29:15.260]  So there was, you know, in the middle there, a little bit of a gap, but that was hard.
[29:15.260 --> 29:21.060]  And it would be even harder today, like just because Apple gives you so much less time
[29:21.060 --> 29:23.780]  to know when the release is coming out, right?
[29:23.780 --> 29:30.380]  Yeah, you'd have to more or less assume it was coming out at the end of September.
[29:30.380 --> 29:35.980]  Well, even like, you know, the whole thing they did with iOS, like, oh, and iOS 14 is
[29:35.980 --> 29:41.120]  out tonight or whenever, you know, like, they used to give you a week or two notice, and
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.940]  you would need that because you would never know, like, is this build going to be the
[29:44.940 --> 29:45.940]  GM?
[29:45.940 --> 29:46.940]  Is this build going to be the GM?
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.360]  And they could still change things, right?
[29:48.360 --> 29:53.180]  So like the lead time on the ebook store stuff alone was such a so annoying, right?
[29:53.180 --> 29:56.380]  You had to build the book and submit it to the stores and get it ready for publication.
[29:56.380 --> 30:00.580]  So you could, you know, flip the switch on day of, but you have to know when day of is
[30:00.580 --> 30:02.940]  otherwise, like, when do you upload?
[30:02.940 --> 30:04.580]  Like, when do you submit, right?
[30:04.580 --> 30:08.100]  These things just, yeah, I don't envy that.
[30:08.100 --> 30:12.020]  And I remember too that, and it makes sense, it's not like, oh, I would have never thought
[30:12.020 --> 30:13.020]  of that.
[30:13.020 --> 30:16.660]  But when you really think about it, and really like flip back through your reviews and see
[30:16.660 --> 30:25.540]  how copiously illustrated they are with screenshots, you were always a moment away from having
[30:25.540 --> 30:31.580]  to retake every single screenshot in a review, because of a cosmetic change in a late beta
[30:31.580 --> 30:32.580]  to the OS.
[30:32.580 --> 30:35.460]  Like, oh, the red, yellow, green buttons have changed slightly.
[30:35.460 --> 30:39.380]  So they change, they change the shade of gray, they move something by a pixel.
[30:39.380 --> 30:42.260]  And the worst part is the screenshots weren't just there for the hell of it, there was always
[30:42.260 --> 30:45.140]  a long section where I talked about the new look.
[30:45.140 --> 30:48.940]  And if I had a whole big paragraph about, you know, the particular shade of gray, and
[30:48.940 --> 30:50.500]  they change the shade of gray, I got to rewrite it too.
[30:50.500 --> 30:55.540]  I don't just know how to take new screenshots, I got to rewrite it.
[30:55.540 --> 30:59.900]  And there was no real way to, you know, you can't just automate it, you can't write like
[30:59.900 --> 31:04.740]  a build script that would take every single screenshot you needed to know you, I mean,
[31:04.740 --> 31:15.660]  I could, but writing that script would probably double the effort of doing the review, yeah.
[31:15.660 --> 31:18.860]  I figured you'd say that, I mean, it was a lot of work.
[31:18.860 --> 31:27.060]  But it is, it's hard because without it, and it, because it was a singular effort, and
[31:27.060 --> 31:32.980]  I don't mean to take away from all the people who'd still write reviews of the annual releases,
[31:32.980 --> 31:35.340]  but nobody, they weren't really even reviews.
[31:35.340 --> 31:36.420]  I don't know what to call them.
[31:36.420 --> 31:41.820]  They were like, sort of an encyclopedia of this, you know, you had your commentary in
[31:41.820 --> 31:47.220]  there, but it was sort of a thorough examination of everything that's new, that's different
[31:47.220 --> 31:49.300]  than a quote unquote review.
[31:49.300 --> 31:55.200]  I think one way to think about it is like through the modern lens, without Twitter for
[31:55.200 --> 32:00.420]  most of the period of time, and without me having regular podcasts for most of the period
[32:00.420 --> 32:06.860]  of time, I had all these thoughts and opinions and, you know, analysis and insight and everything
[32:06.860 --> 32:09.400]  that didn't have an outlet.
[32:09.400 --> 32:15.340]  And so when it came time to do the big review, everything that I had been thinking about
[32:15.340 --> 32:20.140]  related to the OS and the Mac and the platform and everything that would normally get drained
[32:20.140 --> 32:24.520]  out in a podcast episode or in a tweet or something got poured into the review.
[32:24.520 --> 32:27.100]  So yeah, it was here's all the new stuff in the operating system.
[32:27.100 --> 32:31.380]  And yeah, it was, here's what direction we think Mac OS is going, but also every other
[32:31.380 --> 32:37.420]  possible thought and thing I had to say, as you know, as reflected by the change to the
[32:37.420 --> 32:38.420]  operating system.
[32:38.420 --> 32:42.580]  So that's why, you know, you get things in there, like, you know, this whole big section
[32:42.580 --> 32:46.100]  on the Swift programming language isn't technically part of the OS, but it's the thing that I
[32:46.100 --> 32:47.100]  had been thinking about.
[32:47.100 --> 32:52.380]  So that gets its own section or, you know, automatic reference counting or Unix permissions
[32:52.380 --> 32:55.620]  and like all sorts of stuff that seems like why is this even in the article, but I was
[32:55.620 --> 32:59.560]  trying to sort of weave a story of how I was thinking about the Mac over the course of
[32:59.560 --> 33:02.620]  the last year since since I last spoke to you in long form.
[33:02.620 --> 33:08.340]  And I had a blog on ours, like I had other outlets, but I didn't have a weekly tech podcast
[33:08.340 --> 33:09.660]  most of that time.
[33:09.660 --> 33:14.300]  And I wasn't tweeting for half that time either.
[33:14.300 --> 33:21.740]  It is in hindsight, it is a tremendous accomplishment what Apple's done with, for lack of a better
[33:21.740 --> 33:28.220]  catch all name Mac OS 10, right over the entire time that they've been doing it like, because
[33:28.220 --> 33:32.100]  they've, they've never let it get stale.
[33:32.100 --> 33:38.380]  I mean, there have been bad patches, you know, of time, poor poorer than others.
[33:38.380 --> 33:44.180]  But compare and contrast with Microsoft and Windows, which is the the obvious comparison,
[33:44.180 --> 33:50.940]  where it's sort of a singular commercial operating system and the way it's been all over the
[33:50.940 --> 33:56.900]  place, especially the years after XP.
[33:56.900 --> 34:01.260]  It's at a high level, it's really quite a thing.
[34:01.260 --> 34:06.220]  And especially you got to figure, you know, we're looking at 20 plus years at this point,
[34:06.220 --> 34:07.220]  right?
[34:07.220 --> 34:13.020]  I mean, they more or less got started on what became Mac OS 10 in 1997.
[34:13.020 --> 34:20.060]  In some fashion, and by, you know, 98 99, they sort of adhered in on what it was going
[34:20.060 --> 34:21.060]  to be.
[34:21.060 --> 34:23.660]  So 20 years, I mean, that's, there's just a lot of turnover.
[34:23.660 --> 34:28.580]  I mean, that's two decades is enough time that there's an awful lot of people who were
[34:28.580 --> 34:35.220]  instrumental in it who've retired, or, you know, in the case of Steve Jobs died, right?
[34:35.220 --> 34:41.980]  I mean, it's a long time to keep something going that I think when you look at it, at
[34:41.980 --> 34:52.820]  a very macro level, it has been continuously had a vision and a feel and a sort of true
[34:52.820 --> 34:53.820]  to itself-ness.
[34:53.820 --> 35:03.700]  Yeah, it's proven to be a pretty good foundation for Apple to, to explore the space, as they
[35:03.700 --> 35:07.780]  say, they like it was, it was a scaffolding on which they could hang all sorts of ideas
[35:07.780 --> 35:10.300]  and lots of stuff in the operating system has changed.
[35:10.300 --> 35:14.820]  Several subsystems have been replaced and merged and split and the way things are done
[35:14.820 --> 35:16.580]  has just changed radically.
[35:16.580 --> 35:23.780]  And they've been able to make all those changes to the plumbing without really, you know,
[35:23.780 --> 35:29.140]  totally breaking the UI or even even without going through any sort of cosmetic level changes
[35:29.140 --> 35:30.820]  that are particularly jarring.
[35:30.820 --> 35:37.700]  It's just been a steady, I would say evolution that implies that it is improving with respect
[35:37.700 --> 35:40.180]  to the environment that it's in, right?
[35:40.180 --> 35:43.100]  But I think it's just been kind of meandering, right?
[35:43.100 --> 35:47.940]  Mostly going in the right direction, supporting new hardware, supporting the, you know, more
[35:47.940 --> 35:55.140]  features as, as they've been become necessary, but lots of sort of blind alleys and strange
[35:55.140 --> 35:56.140]  ideas.
[35:56.140 --> 36:02.980]  And importantly, it's never really gone through a, like despite being as old as it is, it's
[36:02.980 --> 36:06.680]  never gone through a radical change that is anything close to the change from classic
[36:06.680 --> 36:08.300]  to 10, right?
[36:08.300 --> 36:12.300]  Classic to 10 was like, not a clean sheet, obviously, but it was like, Hey, there's these
[36:12.300 --> 36:13.300]  next folks.
[36:13.300 --> 36:14.300]  They've got their ideas.
[36:14.300 --> 36:15.300]  This is max folks.
[36:15.300 --> 36:16.300]  We've got our ideas.
[36:16.300 --> 36:17.300]  Plus there's some new ideas we can come up with.
[36:17.300 --> 36:18.300]  They mash it together.
[36:18.300 --> 36:21.100]  And that was a big discontinuity from classic to this.
[36:21.100 --> 36:23.540]  But Mac OS X has changed a lot.
[36:23.540 --> 36:28.260]  And if you look, well, look at 10.0 versus a, you know, 10.16, look how different it
[36:28.260 --> 36:29.260]  is.
[36:29.260 --> 36:30.260]  Yeah.
[36:30.260 --> 36:34.340]  But in general, it's got a menu bar, it's got a dock, it's got windows, got scroll bars.
[36:34.340 --> 36:37.420]  Like it's not, you know, it didn't change it that radically.
[36:37.420 --> 36:41.380]  Whereas the classic to 10 transition, no one even remembers that anymore, but it was such
[36:41.380 --> 36:46.500]  a big change that the tech, the capabilities underlying it were changed, our preemptive
[36:46.500 --> 36:51.140]  multitasking, memory protection, the centrality of the dock, a thing that didn't even exist
[36:51.140 --> 36:57.940]  in the other thing, multi-user versus single user, the permissions model, like all of that.
[36:57.940 --> 37:01.420]  And even that change, you know, they still kept the top menu bar and the basics all,
[37:01.420 --> 37:05.500]  you know, all, you know, so there's, there is a through line through the course of the
[37:05.500 --> 37:10.220]  entire history of the Mac, but there's just that one big jump.
[37:10.220 --> 37:15.060]  And despite the fact that we went to, you know, this is Mac OS 11 now, right.
[37:15.060 --> 37:16.060]  Or whatever, right.
[37:16.060 --> 37:19.100]  This, despite the fact that we've incremented the number and gone onto the iOS numbering
[37:19.100 --> 37:21.940]  scheme, it's going to be 12, 13, 14.
[37:21.940 --> 37:26.420]  It's you know, I still think of it as one thing, whether you call it Mac OS X, OS X,
[37:26.420 --> 37:30.500]  or just playing Mac OS now, I don't know, I don't have a good phrase for it.
[37:30.500 --> 37:33.180]  We have classic Mac OS is what we call the other thing.
[37:33.180 --> 37:35.940]  I used to call this thing Mac OS X, but Apple keeps screwing that up.
[37:35.940 --> 37:39.980]  So I don't know if they'll have to call it, but I call it Mac OS X because it's still,
[37:39.980 --> 37:44.660]  there are still parts of the OS that will report that.
[37:44.660 --> 37:49.660]  I forget where you have to go, but there's certain low level parts in that, like in terminal
[37:49.660 --> 37:56.460]  where if you type some, you know, system information things, it'll still claim to be Mac OS X.
[37:56.460 --> 37:58.060]  They did kind of screw us on that.
[37:58.060 --> 38:04.460]  Yeah, but it does, it does seem like this, that Mac OS X has yet to have that moment
[38:04.460 --> 38:07.660]  where someone comes in and says, we got to rethink this.
[38:07.660 --> 38:10.620]  And I don't think it necessarily needs that.
[38:10.620 --> 38:14.140]  But it's now gone longer than classic has without that big rethink.
[38:14.140 --> 38:17.100]  It's gone longer than anything, really.
[38:17.100 --> 38:22.760]  I mean, I think Windows has had several of those moments, although maybe not recently.
[38:22.760 --> 38:23.760]  Maybe they're still...
[38:23.760 --> 38:28.740]  I think 3.1 to 95 was probably the biggest jump, and then there was mostly cosmetic crap.
[38:28.740 --> 38:33.420]  Maybe you could say Windows 8 tried to pull in a direction, but lurking underneath Windows
[38:33.420 --> 38:34.900]  8 is still all the XP stuff.
[38:34.900 --> 38:37.740]  So I don't know how to make it Windows.
[38:37.740 --> 38:41.180]  Yeah, you have Windows installed as a gaming thing, right?
[38:41.180 --> 38:43.020]  You play games.
[38:43.020 --> 38:48.940]  So my son has a gaming PC, and I've spoken about this on podcasts before, but I just
[38:48.940 --> 38:50.860]  don't use, I have no interest in it.
[38:50.860 --> 38:51.860]  Don't use Windows.
[38:51.860 --> 38:52.860]  Haven't used it.
[38:52.860 --> 38:57.700]  The last time I used it personally was, let me think about this.
[38:57.700 --> 39:03.540]  I was writing Daring Fireball, but I had a consulting job out in the suburbs for a few
[39:03.540 --> 39:07.940]  months to make, because I wasn't making any money from Daring Fireball.
[39:07.940 --> 39:17.420]  So I'm going to say it was 2003 to four, or around there.
[39:17.420 --> 39:24.820]  And I had to use a Dell PC to do some programming stuff, and it was so bad.
[39:24.820 --> 39:25.820]  It was...
[39:25.820 --> 39:32.620]  The thing I remember was that it had tap to click on the trackpad, which is the feature
[39:32.620 --> 39:37.520]  where instead of actually clicking the trackpad, you could simulate a click just by touching
[39:37.520 --> 39:38.520]  with your thumb.
[39:38.520 --> 39:44.740]  And of course, I don't know how good it is now, but circa 2003, Windows and a Dell trackpad,
[39:44.740 --> 39:45.780]  it was horrible.
[39:45.780 --> 39:47.640]  And there was no way to turn it off.
[39:47.640 --> 39:54.560]  And I spent two entire days on the clock getting paid, searching for a way to turn off tap
[39:54.560 --> 39:56.640]  to click on this thing.
[39:56.640 --> 40:01.400]  And I wound up just requisitioning a mouse and putting tape over the trackpad and just
[40:01.400 --> 40:03.820]  using a mouse with the laptop to do it.
[40:03.820 --> 40:09.380]  I don't think I've used Windows in any regular sense since around then, 2004.
[40:09.380 --> 40:16.380]  So anyway, Jonas has a gaming PC, and I let him know, this will be mostly on you to become
[40:16.380 --> 40:19.600]  an expert on, because I don't know anything about it.
[40:19.600 --> 40:23.900]  But his video card went bad.
[40:23.900 --> 40:31.700]  He has a 4K monitor, and the manifestation was that the monitor would only run at like
[40:31.700 --> 40:38.120]  640 by 480, or maybe 800 by 600, but nowhere near enough, and it was stretched horribly.
[40:38.120 --> 40:46.380]  And none of his games, of course, would run, but he was still connected to his video card.
[40:46.380 --> 40:50.540]  And so we didn't know how to troubleshoot it, and we Googled it, and there was all sorts
[40:50.540 --> 40:57.220]  of things that you could try to do, but I got to know Windows a lot better than I had
[40:57.220 --> 40:59.900]  in 15 years.
[40:59.900 --> 41:05.320]  And what blew me away troubleshooting this is that for everything that looks totally
[41:05.320 --> 41:11.300]  different in Windows 10, there's a second level that looks like Windows from 10 years
[41:11.300 --> 41:15.180]  ago, and then there's a third level that's just Windows XP.
[41:15.180 --> 41:20.680]  So when you're goofing around with the system settings for the display, there's a new one
[41:20.680 --> 41:26.660]  that looks like the new Windows 10 look, but it only has the very high level stuff to set.
[41:26.660 --> 41:31.460]  And then there's a button somewhere in that that's advanced, and you click that, and it
[41:31.460 --> 41:33.180]  opens up a window.
[41:33.180 --> 41:35.740]  It doesn't even have the new theme.
[41:35.740 --> 41:38.420]  It just looks like Windows from 10 years ago.
[41:38.420 --> 41:42.440]  But then in that dialogue, there's another button that opens up a button that just looks
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.740]  like Windows XP, and that's where all the driver stuff is.
[41:47.740 --> 41:53.380]  They just built all of this new crap on top of the old crap without getting rid of it.
[41:53.380 --> 41:57.180]  It's all still there, and when you get into trouble, you kind of have to dig into it.
[41:57.180 --> 42:03.220]  And even like just the Chrome, just the UI Chrome isn't updated.
[42:03.220 --> 42:08.700]  It's like every sci-fi story, I think most famously parody in Futurama, where the new
[42:08.700 --> 42:11.900]  city is built on top of the old city, which is built on top of the old city, and you just
[42:11.900 --> 42:15.340]  keep going down and down and get to the Morlocks that are down there editing the registry keys
[42:15.340 --> 42:17.240]  or whatever.
[42:17.240 --> 42:24.620]  It blew me away, but it also gave me a tremendous appreciation for the way that for all of my
[42:24.620 --> 42:38.740]  gripes about Mac OS and the ways that I worry that it's gotten worse in recent years philosophically.
[42:38.740 --> 42:47.060]  It made me appreciate how much work and constant effort it takes for Apple not to have ended
[42:47.060 --> 42:51.940]  up with that sort of architecture of new crap built on top of old crap.
[42:51.940 --> 42:57.420]  I mean, it's actually not that different of a mechanism that's causing those two things
[42:57.420 --> 42:58.420]  to happen.
[42:58.420 --> 43:01.700]  The results are obviously very different, but the mechanism is basically companies preserving
[43:01.700 --> 43:07.380]  their value proposition, and the value proposition of Windows is, or was, and still mostly is,
[43:07.380 --> 43:12.780]  we make this operating system that will run on an entire market of hardware, right?
[43:12.780 --> 43:17.300]  So we, Microsoft, don't make the hardware, didn't used to, and lots of people can make
[43:17.300 --> 43:22.100]  the hardware, and it's diverse, and Windows derives its value from being able to be the
[43:22.100 --> 43:28.540]  platform that is built on all that hardware, and Apple, and Microsoft have been defending
[43:28.540 --> 43:33.380]  that value proposition, saying we're not going to change our software in a way that chops
[43:33.380 --> 43:37.820]  off one of the limbs of our value proposition of saying the reason we are valuable is because
[43:37.820 --> 43:42.000]  you can just buy a PC from whoever you want, and Windows will run on it.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.300]  So anything we do to break backward compatibility or do something in a way that some old crappy
[43:46.300 --> 43:51.300]  Dell notebook won't be able to handle, or anything that requires us to tell every single
[43:51.300 --> 43:55.300]  hardware manufacturer to do something different going forward because we really want to do
[43:55.300 --> 43:56.300]  it, it's like pulling teeth.
[43:56.300 --> 43:58.780]  Microsoft has done that plenty of times, like changing the driver model and everything,
[43:58.780 --> 44:04.860]  but it's so painful for them because they have to convince every quote-unquote PC hardware
[44:04.860 --> 44:06.640]  maker in the world to make those changes.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.220]  So Microsoft is not going to do what Apple does, which is like, well, we're just making
[44:10.220 --> 44:14.260]  some changes and everyone will deal with it because that would have slowly eroded, or
[44:14.260 --> 44:19.460]  if not very quickly destroyed their entire value prop, and Apple is the reverse.
[44:19.460 --> 44:23.500]  Their value proposition is we make the whole widget, everything works together seamlessly,
[44:23.500 --> 44:27.860]  and it makes everything simpler and more reliable or whatever.
[44:27.860 --> 44:32.740]  And so when we change things and we say, guess what, for now I'm using Intel processors,
[44:32.740 --> 44:36.380]  we convert the whole line and we just do it, for now I'm using this weird Unix-based thing
[44:36.380 --> 44:41.180]  that came from Next, and the classic is gone and the new thing is here, and doing that
[44:41.180 --> 44:46.740]  seems daring and bold and wow, Microsoft would never do that because they're wimpy, but really
[44:46.740 --> 44:51.780]  Apple is doing what it has to do to maintain the advantages of its vertical integration.
[44:51.780 --> 44:58.500]  So in both cases, it would be like both companies are disinclined to do the opposite, not because
[44:58.500 --> 45:03.180]  either one of them is brave, but because they're both cautious about keeping their good thing
[45:03.180 --> 45:04.180]  going.
[45:04.180 --> 45:05.180]  They're just very different good things.
[45:05.180 --> 45:09.180]  Now in the modern era with Microsoft making its own hardware and things changing rapidly,
[45:09.180 --> 45:14.140]  and Microsoft generally focusing more on services and less on Windows and all that other stuff,
[45:14.140 --> 45:19.420]  and more on Office and less on Windows Office, that may be changing, but for Apple it's still
[45:19.420 --> 45:20.660]  the same deal.
[45:20.660 --> 45:23.460]  They make the whole widget, now they're making the chips in the widget, they're going even
[45:23.460 --> 45:28.660]  harder in the same direction they've always been going.
[45:28.660 --> 45:33.820]  There are certain areas where I feel like Apple is sort of doing the new city built
[45:33.820 --> 45:42.260]  on top of the old city, and it's sort of a disdain for the user.
[45:42.260 --> 45:49.420]  Well, before we even get into that, obviously Next is built on top of BSD, and Mac OS X
[45:49.420 --> 45:57.180]  is built on top of Darwin, so Mac OS X specifically was a city built on top of a city, it was
[45:57.180 --> 46:02.180]  a GUI built on top of Unix, and a different GUI built on top of Unix, and then we had
[46:02.180 --> 46:07.540]  Mac OS, the Carbon APS and everything, built on top of AppKit, which is built on top of
[46:07.540 --> 46:13.540]  BSD, but that's not quite the same thing as, like, there's no digging in Mac OS X where
[46:13.540 --> 46:15.860]  you'll find classic Mac OS lurking underneath, right?
[46:15.860 --> 46:19.220]  So that's the difference.
[46:19.220 --> 46:24.460]  The closest you can get is probably AppleScript and OSA, which is like, of all the things
[46:24.460 --> 46:32.100]  that have lived on from 1993, who would have guessed it was AppleScript and OSA?
[46:32.100 --> 46:38.880]  Which is just mind-boggling to me.
[46:38.880 --> 46:41.700]  You don't really write AppleScript, right?
[46:41.700 --> 46:42.700]  Not a fan.
[46:42.700 --> 46:43.700]  No.
[46:43.700 --> 46:44.700]  But do you ever have to use it?
[46:44.700 --> 46:45.700]  Do you ever use it?
[46:45.700 --> 46:46.700]  I have.
[46:46.700 --> 46:47.700]  I've used it.
[46:47.700 --> 46:52.280]  I've, you know, used it to get things done that was the most direct way to accomplish,
[46:52.280 --> 46:55.780]  but I just, as a programmer, I just, it rubs me the wrong way.
[46:55.780 --> 46:58.420]  I've never been able to get into it.
[46:58.420 --> 47:02.860]  I find it harder than actual programming just because it doesn't match with my programmer
[47:02.860 --> 47:08.260]  mindset and, like, the whole, even back in the day when it was the modern technology,
[47:08.260 --> 47:12.500]  the whole thing of scripting dictionaries and Apple events just didn't match the way
[47:12.500 --> 47:17.300]  I thought about automating things, so I always found it frustrating.
[47:17.300 --> 47:22.040]  I've been using it a lot, just in recent weeks, because it's like one of those things where
[47:22.040 --> 47:28.120]  once you dig something out, then it's like, ah, well, I've got it out, I might as well,
[47:28.120 --> 47:33.740]  and I've been, like, crossing off a list of very old, years-long to-dos of little Apple
[47:33.740 --> 47:41.540]  script things I wanted to make or ones I wrote many years ago and wanted to edit.
[47:41.540 --> 47:50.580]  And a couple of them involve me doing stuff in Perl and then calling to OSA script from
[47:50.580 --> 47:55.980]  Perl with the, you know, the shell script OSA script command.
[47:55.980 --> 48:00.540]  And, like, to show a notification, like, here's a little thing I have in Perl that I run all
[48:00.540 --> 48:05.820]  the time, but wouldn't it be nice to have, like, a notification center thing do this,
[48:05.820 --> 48:06.820]  show this thing?
[48:06.820 --> 48:10.860]  And you can do that by calling out to the OSA script thing.
[48:10.860 --> 48:16.460]  But I'm mixing, like, bbedit in one window writing Perl.
[48:16.460 --> 48:19.100]  This is literally something that happened to me today.
[48:19.100 --> 48:27.020]  It's such an impotence mismatch of styles of programming where I had written in Perl
[48:27.020 --> 48:34.420]  my whatever variable name to the value instead of an equal sign, because in Apple script
[48:34.420 --> 48:40.340]  you don't assign with an equals, you say set the variable name to the value.
[48:40.340 --> 48:48.820]  And it was one of those bugs where I wrote it but also wrote a couple of other lines,
[48:48.820 --> 48:54.460]  and then I started getting an error from Perl, but it was so confusing to the Perl parser
[48:54.460 --> 48:58.060]  that the error message was no help at all.
[48:58.060 --> 49:03.180]  It gave me the line, and I could look at the line, but I was in such a weird half-writing
[49:03.180 --> 49:07.820]  Apple script, half-writing a normal, here I am calling Perl a normal programming language,
[49:07.820 --> 49:13.320]  but, you know, at least it uses equals for assignment, that I couldn't see that I wrote
[49:13.320 --> 49:16.000]  the word TO as an assignment.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.500]  And then I was like, oh, I need to stop.
[49:19.500 --> 49:23.180]  But anyway, switching back and forth in languages always does that.
[49:23.180 --> 49:27.820]  I imagine for people who are multilingual in spoken languages there's the same problem,
[49:27.820 --> 49:32.080]  but I get it all the time, programming languages, because being a web programmer, you're always
[49:32.080 --> 49:33.080]  dealing with multiple languages.
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.600]  I mean, for the longest time it was JavaScript on the client and something other than JavaScript
[49:37.600 --> 49:38.600]  on the server.
[49:38.600 --> 49:42.180]  These days you can't actually do JavaScript on the server and the client, but there are
[49:42.180 --> 49:46.220]  still other things in the mix there, like CSS and all the other stuff, so having to
[49:46.220 --> 49:50.260]  be multilingual is kind of a requirement, but yeah, it can really screw you up if you
[49:50.260 --> 49:51.260]  forget where you are.
[49:51.260 --> 49:55.220]  Even just switching back and forth from Swift to anything else, the whole semicolons-at-the-end-of-the-line
[49:55.220 --> 49:58.500]  thing can really throw you off.
[49:58.500 --> 50:01.900]  That's definitely true, all of a sudden.
[50:01.900 --> 50:07.020]  Well, does Swift let you put semicolons and they don't do anything, or no?
[50:07.020 --> 50:14.940]  I rarely, I can't remember what it does, because my failure mode is I stop putting the semicolons
[50:14.940 --> 50:16.060]  in all the other languages.
[50:16.060 --> 50:20.700]  I don't start putting them in Swift, I just did that today, I was writing Perl code today,
[50:20.700 --> 50:23.140]  didn't have a semicolon, tried to run it, it's complaining, I'm like, what the hell,
[50:23.140 --> 50:24.140]  it's perfectly fine.
[50:24.140 --> 50:25.140]  Oh, the semicolon.
[50:25.140 --> 50:30.140]  Well, and in hindsight too, I mean, I don't write Swift, I can't do a whole podcast talking
[50:30.140 --> 50:39.260]  about Swift fairly, but it's true that the C derivatives that all put semicolons at the
[50:39.260 --> 50:45.780]  end of their lines, it's very crufty, and it's just to support the idea that you can
[50:45.780 --> 50:51.860]  cram more than one line of code onto an actual line of your text editor, which is a very,
[50:51.860 --> 50:53.460]  very bad idea.
[50:53.460 --> 50:56.660]  And it makes the compiler, writing the compiler easier, right?
[50:56.660 --> 50:58.660]  That's really what it is.
[50:58.660 --> 51:02.460]  It's not like the secret technology didn't exist to not have semicolons, but it just
[51:02.460 --> 51:06.660]  makes it so much easier that I can imagine if you're back in the 70s saying, we're going
[51:06.660 --> 51:11.060]  to make a language, and it's not going to be line-based, so we can't just use new lines
[51:11.060 --> 51:12.900]  as the end of the line.
[51:12.900 --> 51:14.700]  But we have to have some delimiter, right?
[51:14.700 --> 51:17.580]  Because if it's not a new line, it's got to be like a semicolon, and someone would say,
[51:17.580 --> 51:21.700]  well, you can figure out when the line is over based on the syntax of the language.
[51:21.700 --> 51:26.300]  Because if you know the next thing that you see is not something that could possibly be
[51:26.300 --> 51:29.260]  a continuation of the previous statement, you've found the barrier, and you're like,
[51:29.260 --> 51:30.260]  why would we do that complexity?
[51:30.260 --> 51:33.500]  Then someone would say, well, yeah, you're right, we could do that, but why would we
[51:33.500 --> 51:34.500]  do that to ourselves?
[51:34.500 --> 51:38.060]  Why don't we just pick a character like new line or semicolon, and then the parser will
[51:38.060 --> 51:40.820]  know when it's over instead of us having to guess?
[51:40.820 --> 51:46.780]  But things have changed so much since then that in a more modern language like Swift,
[51:46.780 --> 51:54.260]  we understand now that the pain of the compiler designer is nothing compared to the pain of
[51:54.260 --> 51:57.860]  all the people who are going to write programs, because the compiler is written relatively
[51:57.860 --> 52:01.580]  few times by a relatively small number of people, and the programs are written by millions
[52:01.580 --> 52:03.840]  and are constantly being written and rewritten.
[52:03.840 --> 52:06.240]  So yeah, we'll put the complexity in the compiler.
[52:06.240 --> 52:11.220]  We'll do the work to figure out where one statement ends and another statement begins,
[52:11.220 --> 52:14.100]  because it is a solvable problem, because the language is not infinite.
[52:14.100 --> 52:18.860]  We know what can be a continuation of the previous statement and what can't be.
[52:18.860 --> 52:22.380]  And we'll do it for the programmer, and that saves a lot of typing and a lot of pinkies
[52:22.380 --> 52:23.380]  on the semicolon.
[52:23.380 --> 52:28.740]  But if you didn't know any better, you would think that the standard QWERTY US keyboard
[52:28.740 --> 52:34.660]  layout that puts semicolon right under one of your fingers all the time, that the keyboard
[52:34.660 --> 52:40.860]  layer was made by somebody who was programming C or a C derivative language, because programmers
[52:40.860 --> 52:46.580]  who write in those languages use semicolon all the time at the end of terminating every
[52:46.580 --> 52:47.580]  line.
[52:47.580 --> 52:51.700]  Whereas normal people, most normal people, even people who write all day long, maybe
[52:51.700 --> 52:56.180]  even people who call themselves writers, I think Kurt Vonnegut famously, he has like
[52:56.180 --> 53:01.020]  a good rant about the semicolon, that he thinks it's terrible, that you should never use it
[53:01.020 --> 53:02.900]  and it's pretentious.
[53:02.900 --> 53:08.340]  But there's your pinky finger under this punctuation character that most people never, literally
[53:08.340 --> 53:10.260]  never use.
[53:10.260 --> 53:14.780]  Don't even know the rules of grammar when they're supposed to use it, ostensibly.
[53:14.780 --> 53:19.500]  The QWERTY layout has many quirks that don't seem to make sense when you examine them,
[53:19.500 --> 53:22.780]  but it's like just one of those things, he gets his foot in the door and that's just
[53:22.780 --> 53:24.900]  the way the keyboards are and we just deal with it.
[53:24.900 --> 53:28.140]  The semicolon has to be one of the strangest quirks of the keyboard, though.
[53:28.140 --> 53:32.780]  I mean, that's good for, you know, it was a happy accident for programmers and maybe
[53:32.780 --> 53:33.780]  that's why they picked semicolon.
[53:33.780 --> 53:38.580]  I don't know the history of whoever first picked semicolon as a separator, but, you
[53:38.580 --> 53:43.100]  know, underscore requiring the shift key kind of counterbalances that a lot.
[53:43.100 --> 53:47.580]  Well, if anything, you would think just logically if you could redo it, even if you were only
[53:47.580 --> 53:53.460]  going to make just one tiny tweak, you would just change the colon and the semicolon in
[53:53.460 --> 53:59.860]  terms of making the colon just your pinky and semicolon, the shift variant.
[53:59.860 --> 54:03.340]  They probably would have picked colon as the, I don't know what they would have, colon doesn't
[54:03.340 --> 54:06.460]  really work as the statement ending because it has other meanings in languages.
[54:06.460 --> 54:09.500]  I wonder, I don't think that's why they picked the semicolon.
[54:09.500 --> 54:14.180]  I think it's, you know, because dot was too valuable even in C, they had to use, you know,
[54:14.180 --> 54:18.380]  you couldn't use period, but, you know, exclamation mark would have made it look like you were
[54:18.380 --> 54:20.980]  angry at the end of every line.
[54:20.980 --> 54:26.720]  So, you know, like, you know, I don't know if lexically is the right word, what linguistically
[54:26.720 --> 54:30.060]  semantically semicolon makes sense, right?
[54:30.060 --> 54:31.420]  It's like, it's sort of the end.
[54:31.420 --> 54:33.820]  I mean, I mean, a period would make sense, right?
[54:33.820 --> 54:37.580]  But, you know, but period was too valuable, you know, they wanted to use it for something
[54:37.580 --> 54:38.580]  else.
[54:38.580 --> 54:43.980]  Well, I mean, to be used period for decimal point, but like in in modern languages, they
[54:43.980 --> 54:49.540]  all, they all use period where C decided to use hyphen and then shift for the greater
[54:49.540 --> 54:50.540]  than sign.
[54:50.540 --> 54:51.540]  Right.
[54:51.540 --> 54:52.540]  Right.
[54:52.540 --> 54:53.540]  To make a little arrow.
[54:53.540 --> 54:54.540]  Right.
[54:54.540 --> 54:55.540]  And no one wants to type that anymore.
[54:55.540 --> 54:59.100]  Modern languages are not all about typing little arrows, they just use the dot for that
[54:59.100 --> 55:00.100]  all the time.
[55:00.100 --> 55:01.100]  Right.
[55:01.100 --> 55:08.500]  Have you seen the programming fonts that use ligatures to combine hyphen greater than to
[55:08.500 --> 55:10.740]  become an arrow ligature?
[55:10.740 --> 55:11.740]  It's terrible.
[55:11.740 --> 55:12.820]  I don't like it.
[55:12.820 --> 55:13.820]  Terrible idea.
[55:13.820 --> 55:20.580]  If you want to, I could see making a language that would make the actual Unicode right facing
[55:20.580 --> 55:24.780]  arrow an alternative to I don't even like that.
[55:24.780 --> 55:25.780]  It's too hard to type.
[55:25.780 --> 55:27.220]  Well, as an alternative.
[55:27.220 --> 55:28.220]  Yeah.
[55:28.220 --> 55:31.220]  But then you're editing someone's code and they decided to use that and now you feel
[55:31.220 --> 55:33.620]  like you have to match that and now you got to figure out how to type that and you're
[55:33.620 --> 55:34.620]  copying pasting.
[55:34.620 --> 55:35.620]  It's terrible.
[55:35.620 --> 55:36.620]  No, it's not good.
[55:36.620 --> 55:40.420]  Well, you could make like a macro that I mean, the ligature is the worst of both worlds.
[55:40.420 --> 55:42.660]  You got the ugly looking thing, but really under the covers.
[55:42.660 --> 55:44.700]  It's just a hyphen and a greater than sign.
[55:44.700 --> 55:45.700]  Right.
[55:45.700 --> 55:47.980]  But it looks like just and they're ugly.
[55:47.980 --> 55:48.980]  They don't look right.
[55:48.980 --> 55:49.980]  They don't look like code.
[55:49.980 --> 55:50.980]  Right.
[55:50.980 --> 55:53.460]  And then it's masking the actual characters that you've written.
[55:53.460 --> 55:59.300]  Like ligatures are things where you want beautiful typography for artistic purposes and code
[55:59.300 --> 56:00.300]  is not that.
[56:00.300 --> 56:01.300]  Right.
[56:01.300 --> 56:05.260]  Well, the whole reason and the whole reason that most people like to write their code
[56:05.260 --> 56:11.060]  and I'm still even today in a monospace font is not because it looks better, but because
[56:11.060 --> 56:19.580]  it makes it so, so much easier to make sure that, oh, yes, this is a single quote and
[56:19.580 --> 56:21.140]  then another single quote.
[56:21.140 --> 56:26.140]  It's not a double quote because they're spaced, you know, and that you can you get the clarity
[56:26.140 --> 56:30.660]  of of, you know, punctuation characters don't just fly by there.
[56:30.660 --> 56:33.300]  They all get lots of emphasis.
[56:33.300 --> 56:34.940]  It's predictability and consistency.
[56:34.940 --> 56:36.380]  That's why they go with monospace.
[56:36.380 --> 56:39.940]  Now, there have been at various times fads of trying to program proportional fonts.
[56:39.940 --> 56:48.860]  But the the ability to program, but the ability to look at code and see because it's so important
[56:48.860 --> 56:52.540]  that it'd be unambiguous to you about what characters are actually out there.
[56:52.540 --> 56:56.260]  Any kind of ambiguity, even if it, quote unquote, looks better from artistic perspective is
[56:56.260 --> 56:57.420]  terrible for code.
[56:57.420 --> 57:00.700]  So you want to know that everyone of those characters is going to take up the same amount
[57:00.700 --> 57:02.620]  of space and you can look at it.
[57:02.620 --> 57:05.860]  And this is setting aside things like Python where you're lining up the white space, but
[57:05.860 --> 57:09.580]  just even just regular program language, like you said, there should be no ambiguity.
[57:09.580 --> 57:12.900]  You should be able to tell a single quote from, you know, a double quote from two single
[57:12.900 --> 57:17.180]  quotes in a row completely unambiguously, because you can't go this.
[57:17.180 --> 57:20.860]  It's hard enough to find bugs like legit, regular, just human error bugs, let alone
[57:20.860 --> 57:22.100]  sneaky ones like that.
[57:22.100 --> 57:26.740]  That's why there's all these, you know, troll memes where people will put what is it?
[57:26.740 --> 57:29.740]  There's some character that looks exactly like a semicolon, but isn't a semicolon in
[57:29.740 --> 57:30.740]  Unicode.
[57:30.740 --> 57:32.220]  There's a bunch of characters that are like that.
[57:32.220 --> 57:36.400]  We just went through that with the with the title of that that we're a game engine app
[57:36.400 --> 57:39.860]  that shows your weather in a big 3D font, like the little lowercase letter A that doesn't
[57:39.860 --> 57:40.860]  look like an A.
[57:40.860 --> 57:41.860]  Yep.
[57:41.860 --> 57:42.860]  Yep.
[57:42.860 --> 57:43.860]  The note.
[57:43.860 --> 57:44.860]  It's the the no more.
[57:44.860 --> 57:47.020]  I haven't linked to it from Daring Fireball yet, but by the time this podcast airs, I
[57:47.020 --> 57:49.980]  will have so I can talk about it in the past sense.
[57:49.980 --> 57:58.820]  But the Andy Works apps under the banner, no more boring apps there there there.
[57:58.820 --> 58:00.100]  I wonder how many people have noticed.
[58:00.100 --> 58:05.620]  I haven't seen anybody on Twitter complaining yet, but like the weather app in on the iOS
[58:05.620 --> 58:07.740]  home screen just says weather.
[58:07.740 --> 58:15.500]  But the A is a in typography terms, a single story A just like a sort of what you think
[58:15.500 --> 58:17.180]  of little kids, right?
[58:17.180 --> 58:22.140]  It's a circle with just a bar next to it as opposed to the sort of fancier double story
[58:22.140 --> 58:30.740]  A. And San Francisco, the Mac or actually Apple's system font everywhere has an alternate
[58:30.740 --> 58:32.840]  glyph like an open type feature.
[58:32.840 --> 58:36.460]  And I guess it's not really open type because it's true type, but it's the same sort of
[58:36.460 --> 58:37.460]  thing.
[58:37.460 --> 58:42.000]  And if you're in an app that lets you have control, you know, like Adobe apps or the
[58:42.000 --> 58:50.900]  typography panel in some of the app kit apps that give you the alternative glyphs for fancy
[58:50.900 --> 58:55.920]  fonts that have multiple versions of letters like A, you can do that.
[58:55.920 --> 58:58.740]  But how did how did world did he specify it on the home screen?
[58:58.740 --> 59:03.020]  And we figured out that it's it's just the Unicode, what's it what's the code is like
[59:03.020 --> 59:04.020]  0251.
[59:04.020 --> 59:06.420]  There's a Unicode code point.
[59:06.420 --> 59:11.980]  Yeah, there's a Unicode code point to specify an A like that.
[59:11.980 --> 59:17.100]  And the day it looks clever, because if you notice it, it's like, huh, he's got the different
[59:17.100 --> 59:20.100]  lowercase A's in the app names.
[59:20.100 --> 59:25.420]  But the downside is if you go to search for apps and type W, you can't type it now.
[59:25.420 --> 59:31.500]  If you type W, it shows up, but once you get to W EA, it no longer shows up because it's
[59:31.500 --> 59:32.500]  not really an A.
[59:32.500 --> 59:37.220]  Yeah, I mean, really, the search should be doing so there's some kind of normalization
[59:37.220 --> 59:40.460]  or folding to try to match that the same way it does case folding, but it's actually a
[59:40.460 --> 59:41.460]  pretty hard problem.
[59:41.460 --> 59:44.920]  And that's why the trolls of like putting in the was it the German question mark looks
[59:44.920 --> 59:47.100]  like a semicolon or something like that.
[59:47.100 --> 59:50.180]  And people's code won't compile, and they'll stare at it for hours and say, but it's right,
[59:50.180 --> 59:51.180]  it's perfectly fine.
[59:51.180 --> 59:52.340]  What is it complaining about?
[59:52.340 --> 59:53.340]  Right.
[59:53.340 --> 59:56.780]  So, you know, eventually, if you debug code long enough, you'll start doing things that
[59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.660]  make no sense to you, like deleting the line and retyping it and that will actually solve
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.660]  the problem.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.740]  And you won't understand why it's because you deleted the fake semicolon or the real
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.740]  one.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.740]  Right.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.260]  But you could have programming languages that are smart enough to do this.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.860]  The other one is people, I used to see this on Windows, but Windows people programming
[01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.760]  on Windows platforms would do this all the time.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.300]  They would copy and paste something out of Word or out of like an email from Outlook
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.300]  on Windows.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.500]  And it would be filled with non-breaking spaces.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.180]  And the compiler would choke to death on the non-breaking spaces, but they look exactly
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.020]  the same as spaces in your text editor.
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:31.060]  And they would just, you know, that's why BBS has zap gremlins, right?
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.420]  You don't see it anymore because I think it was so pernicious.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:40.140]  But in the earlier days of the web, when it was, CSS either wasn't even invented yet or
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:46.140]  wasn't taken over, people would indent code, like code examples on a web page with non-breaking
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.140]  spaces.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:53.700]  Because it was the only way to get it to work because white space collapses in HTML.
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:57.420]  And then you'd go, okay, there's a line, there's a couple of lines of code that'll work.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.860]  You copy, you paste, and then your whole program falls apart.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:05.500]  And then you realize that it was because you copied and pasted non-breaking spaces.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.980]  And the compiler would give you some error message that made no sense.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:08.980]  No sense at all.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:09.980]  It wouldn't say there's a non-breaking space.
[01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.660]  It would just say some other error, like on the, like, yeah, the message wouldn't be helpful.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.300]  I mean, and you could put code in pre-tags or whatever, but people wanted it to be in
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.660]  a nice font and all this other stuff.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:26.700]  That gets to my point though, is that some of the changes to Mac OS over the years that
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:35.740]  are unpleasant, but I completely understand is the ways that the world has changed for
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:43.380]  the worse and that the broader world of scammers, if not outright criminals, you know, who have
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.380]  caught onto things.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:49.980]  You know, one of them is, you know, the same thing with the alternate glyphs where, remember
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:56.140]  when there were like domain names that would look like Yahoo, except instead of two O's,
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:00.740]  it was like some weird alternate glyph and Unicode that looked like O's.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:04.340]  But how in the world is a normal person supposed to know that's not yahoo.com?
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.780]  You know, it looks like it.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:13.460]  And so all the browsers and everybody had to sort of go through this absolutely Byzantine
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:23.620]  normalization to make sure that spoof URLs or domain names, you know, wouldn't go through.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.220]  And there's so much stuff in Mac OS X now that it's sort of like that too.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.900]  I mean, that's why all this security stuff has been added.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:38.100]  I mean, just the way, I guess that we kind of, Apple kind of bit the bullet in Catalina
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:45.620]  1015 with a lot of this, where when you first update it to 1015, you'd get an awful lot
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:51.660]  of, oh, the first time you wanted to use your clipboard manager in every app, it would be
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.460]  like, oh, do you want to give permission to Payspot to automate this?
[01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:02.540]  You have to, you know, go to system preferences and give it, you know, the permission to control
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.900]  your screen, the accessibility thing.
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:11.020]  And it's such a big, if you, as long, you know, like as a normal long-standing Mac user,
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.980]  it's like, you just want to do the stuff you've been doing on your Mac forever.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:19.220]  And all of a sudden now it does feel like you're the John Hodgman character in that
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:24.320]  old I'm a Mac, you're a PC ad where you're like caught in a loop of authorizing every
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.740]  single step of the way.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:30.380]  But you know why they're doing it because if they didn't, there were scammy apps that
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.020]  were taking advantage of it.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.760]  Yeah, there's a bright side to this too, though.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.360]  Like Windows went through the same thing.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.100]  They went through it a little bit earlier.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:44.940]  But like the cool technical side of it is, you know, not just security requirements on
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.340]  apps and having them ask for permissions, but things, all the most dangerous things
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:54.140]  on the Mac have been redesigned to be, and on Windows, have been redesigned to be less
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.140]  dangerous.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.320]  The biggest and most recent one, I think, on both platforms that Windows again did it
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.680]  before the Mac, I think, is user space drivers.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.140]  Get third-party software out of the kernel.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:08.020]  If you just want to plug in a new mouse or something or a webcam, you shouldn't have
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:11.260]  arbitrary code from a third party running in kernel mode where it can do essentially
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.940]  anything to your entire system, right?
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:19.300]  And getting all those, and all the processes that already were running in user space to
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.740]  put them in sandboxes, right?
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:26.020]  To basically say there is less that, you know, there's less that can really take down your
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020]  computer.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.620]  And these days we don't think about that too much, like, oh, you know, kernel panics are
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:37.640]  rare and Apple hates kernel panics and they're disastrous, but nowadays Apple is really trying
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.980]  to get everybody out of the kernel except for Apple.
[01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.180]  And so, yeah, you still have kernel panics and they're 100% Apple's fault then.
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:46.540]  It's much better than having kernel panics because you bought a new mouse at, you know,
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:51.940]  Egghead and it came with a driver and now that's kernel panicking your computer, right?
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:56.540]  And it takes a long time to engineer that the right way to get all the drivers or even
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.000]  the trivial stuff like USB peripherals out of the kernel while still allowing them to
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.380]  have good performance and be able to do all the stuff they're doing.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:08.840]  Same thing with network filters and the new OS being all in user space and then sandboxing
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.660]  for all of Apple's demons that run all the stuff, trying to make them be not only separate
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:18.780]  processes, which happened years ago, but separate processes that have almost no permission to
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.060]  do anything except for the one thing they need to do.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.100]  Like if this process never needs to access the network, why does it have access to the
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:26.100]  network?
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.100]  Should it have access to the file system?
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.780]  It shouldn't have access to the file system.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.140]  And all of that makes our Macs better and more stable in the long run.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.900]  In the short run, it's like, oh, they just ripped out the whole driver system and replace
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:39.220]  it with the user space one and now all the scraps buggy and Bluetooth doesn't work, right?
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.220]  Right.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.220]  So that feels bad.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.540]  But in the long run, that is good.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.700]  And it's the type of good that doesn't come with permission dialogs, right?
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:52.940]  Because, you know, Bluetooth or whatever comes and it's pre-installed and it works and you
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.740]  have no idea whether it's running code inside the kernel or not.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:02.300]  But eventually, once it settles down stability-wise in terms of the Bluetooth part functioning,
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:06.140]  it's no longer going to have the capability to take down your whole computer, right?
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.740]  It will only have the capability to screw up Bluetooth, which is bad, but I think they'll
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.740]  work that out.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:13.140]  So I'm mostly optimistic about all those changes.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.600]  There are bumps in the road where maybe they're asking this dialog too much or maybe it's
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.940]  too hard to allow it.
[01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.260]  Like they don't want to do the Windows thing, which is what the ad was making fun of, which
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:26.340]  is bring up a dialog and just have a button that lets you proceed and give permission.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.980]  Apple makes you dismiss the dialog and it makes you go to a whole other application
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:35.740]  on your own, maybe with some assistance from a very clever Mac program, and do things somewhere
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.580]  else and come back.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:41.520]  Like they make it enough work so that you can't just go, okay, okay, okay, okay, because
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.380]  that would defeat the entire security purpose because everyone would just be going allow,
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:49.980]  allow, allow, allow, which is kind of what they do on iOS, but iOS is so locked down
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:53.160]  from the beginning that you can't really allow, allow, and yeah, you'll probably leak your
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.940]  personal information, but there's never been anything an iOS app can do to like kernel
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.940]  panic your phone, right?
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:03.740]  Or at least if that happens, it's not the app's fault, it's Apple's fault doing that.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.020]  And I don't blame them for it.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.460]  I don't blame them for making you do that and go to system prefs and go to security
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.020]  and privacy and do it.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:18.180]  What I do blame them for is that they haven't gone and really thoroughly redone the interface
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.580]  for that in system preferences.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:27.600]  Like you wind up with these little tiny, unreseizable panes, like for here's my list for location
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.080]  services.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:35.380]  And I've got, I don't know, every app that's ever asked for location services is listed
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.380]  here.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:42.340]  But the little tiny pane in the security prefs that it only shows four apps at a time, and
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:44.100]  there's no way to resize it.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.100]  It's
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:50.460]  I do, I do, I don't know if I appreciate this, it could be an accident, but now look at stuff
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.460]  like this.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.980]  Like this is the thing that I definitely want to talk about if I was doing reviews, scroll
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:57.420]  your list of location services all the way up to the top.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:03.320]  Notice that the the tiny little porthole that we're viewing through does not exactly hold
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.140]  an integer number of items.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.220]  And that's to give you a visual clue that there's more.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:13.460]  But that clue depends on the next icon being tall enough to peek its little head out, right?
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:17.980]  Because if it doesn't, it just looks like a screwed up window that doesn't fit the number
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:18.980]  of items, right?
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.740]  So I think someone is trying to do the right thing, which is, you really should show in
[01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:27.700]  this stupid error where the scroll bars are hidden by default, unless you have a mouse
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.700]  attached or whatever with a scroll wheel, you have no way to know that there's any more
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.140]  and I've seen this failure mode, I've seen this failure mode, I'm trying to coach my
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.440]  parents through doing things like this, they go to the thing like, okay, I see a list,
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.860]  but I don't see that thing in the list.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:42.700]  I'm like, scroll list, like scroll, what list, see the list of things that says, you know,
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.300]  these four apps, there's more underneath.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.300]  Well, how was I supposed to know that?
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.380]  Sometimes I can say, well, you can see the head of the little icon poking up, but other
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:53.140]  times I'd say, you just need to know that sometimes you can scroll or I just turn and
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.500]  make the scroll bars be always on.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.940]  But either way, it's, I hope someone was trying to do the right thing.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:02.940]  But you're totally right that this interface is suboptimal, let's say, and it's an example,
[01:09:02.940 --> 01:09:06.960]  and you're probably not going to like this, but I feel like it's an example of where web
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:13.300]  UI, web page, web app UI, generally does this better in terms of the mechanics, if not the
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:18.800]  specifics of the UI elements, web UIs, if they have a long list, they give you a real
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.180]  time filter at the top of it, right?
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.840]  And they give you an indication of how long the list is, and they give you way more information
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.740]  in a way more flexible thing, because there's lots of things on the web that give you a
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.140]  long list that they want you to quickly filter or find something on.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:34.940]  And in the dark corners of the Mac, scroll view is fine.
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.940]  That's all they need.
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:40.020]  But if you know there's gonna be 50 items there, give me the little quick search thing,
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:44.300]  give me a little information that says 55 items showing items five of 25 or whatever
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:51.220]  lots of sort of web UI conventions that we're used to on the web are actually useful if
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:56.580]  backported to native UI to help us deal with the same problem, which is a big list of things.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:57.900]  I don't disagree with that.
[01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:05.900]  I mean, that certainly isn't one of my beefs with web apps, you know, I think that it is
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:14.740]  it honestly feels to me almost like a 20 year old idiom that's just been cemented is the
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:21.260]  idea of little like you called it a little portal, like a fixed sized list that in an
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.180]  unreasonable window, and it's just laid out like this.
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:29.540]  It just feels like something from a bygone era.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:35.260]  I mean, it feels like a web 1.0 thing back when web pages were not as it's hard to believe
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.380]  that someone had to make a board called responsive, which meant that web apps change size based
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.380]  on the window size, right?
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:45.700]  You'd from from day one Mac you eyes have been essentially responsive in that you change
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:49.220]  the window size and they would expand to fill it's just that system preferences in particular
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:54.060]  has been, you know, we inherited it from next and it's changed a lot over the years.
[01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:58.180]  But one thing that hasn't changed is it's a single window and you type on an icon and
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.640]  the contents of that window change and even though the height of the window changes the
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.700]  width does not and it's not resizable.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.980]  Can you imagine a version of system preferences that was resizable?
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:12.580]  I have seen no reason why we can't have that like we have the technology to lay out the
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:17.660]  layout scroll views in a resizable window, I swear, but no one has ever bothered to do
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.620]  that just as the preferences because it would I don't know, we would maybe break the layout
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.060]  of the main page and they'd have to make the icons bigger, but I don't know.
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:28.020]  It's just it's a corner of Mac OS and there are a lot of them that hasn't gotten that
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.100]  much attention because it works.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:35.500]  And I think it was OK back when, you know, people were not expected to visit here very
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.460]  often, but starting Catalina, everybody's visiting this particular preference pane a
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:40.460]  whole lot.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:45.860]  So they really should reconsider the UI of system preferences, essentially like there
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.860]  are tons of ways to do system preferences better than it's done now.
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.100]  And it's just, you know, hasn't been hasn't been changed in what I'm not going to say
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.220]  20 years because they did change it from like, I don't know if you remember, but what it
[01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:02.380]  looked like in 10.0 or the bay is it was totally weird, but it hasn't changed in many, many
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380]  years.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.380]  Let's say.
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.380]  Yeah.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:10.740]  And especially with a lot of the new security stuff, it's like one of the really neat innovations
[01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.620]  that next came up with and carried through is the column view.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:19.580]  And it's an interesting way of showing hierarchy.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:26.540]  And it really shined at its brightest with the original iPhone.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540]  Right.
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:33.620]  Because the general metaphor for most iPhone apps right from the original iPhone in 2007
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.980]  was effectively column view, except that it would only show you one column at a time because
[01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.480]  the phone was tall and skinny and very small.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.460]  But you'd go to, you know, just look at system perhaps or look at mail where you'd open mail
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.820]  and to this day, you open it up and here's a list of your accounts and you click an account
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:54.300]  and then there's a list of mailboxes and you click a mailbox, tap a mailbox, and it just
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:59.300]  keeps pushing over left to right as you go down the hierarchy.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:07.260]  Whereas in system preferences, the hierarchy isn't indicated in any logical way at all.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.820]  It's all just sort of abstract where you go to security and privacy at the top level,
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.360]  but you're picking from a list of icons.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.100]  Then you have to go to privacy, which is a tab at the top, which is a totally different
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.940]  thing you're picking.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:27.380]  And then you've got a list on the left side of the different privacy things to go to,
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:32.140]  which is how you get to the little tiny four row window on the right.
[01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:40.620]  It's like every single layer of the hierarchy is a completely different UI paradigm.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.340]  And that's just security and privacy.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.000]  All the other preference frames are totally different.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  They do their own thing.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.180]  You never know what you're going to find when you click one of those icons.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.300]  So there's an area where I would have a complaint.
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300]  Let me take a break here.
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:53.300]  Thank our next sponsor.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.300]  It's our good friends.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300]  Longtime sponsor.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300]  They're back.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300]  It's Hover.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.020]  Look, Hover has been a sponsor here for a long time.
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:04.540]  They are a great domain name registrar.
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.500]  They have over 300 domain name extensions now, which is mind blowing to me because I
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.700]  remember when they were like five.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:15.220]  When you want to start a new brand online, you want to register a new website, just a
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:20.060]  new domain name just to get your email, they have it.
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.660]  No matter what you want to build, there's a domain name waiting for it.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:26.580]  You'll find excellent tech support for any questions you may have.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.260]  Their support team does not try to upsell you.
[01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:32.680]  They are not like other domain name registrars.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:37.420]  All they want to do is they just want to help you get online, get a good domain name, answer
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]  your questions.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.180]  They have free Whois privacy protection.
[01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:46.020]  They have a very, very clean user interface, super easy to understand.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:51.300]  Monthly sales on popular top level domain names, everything you'd want, great support,
[01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:57.260]  no upsells, great prices, great support, a great search interface.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:02.100]  If your first choice for whatever your domain you want.com isn't available, they show you
[01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:05.620]  great suggestions for what might be available.
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.620]  It's just a great service.
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:12.220]  They also have great two-factor authentication support to get that set up, which probably
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.020]  recommendable for just about everything you use, but for your domain name registrar is
[01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.620]  certainly one of the things you want to lock down the best.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:24.260]  Everything you'd want, 300 top level domain names to choose from, great prices.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:31.660]  You can get your next domain name by going to hover.com slash talk show, hover, H-O-V-E-R.com
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:37.540]  slash talk show, get a 10% discount with that referral link on all new purchases.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:41.400]  So save 10% with hover.com slash talk show.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.860]  My thanks to hover.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.940]  So zooming out again, big picture.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:55.560]  A couple of years ago, let's say leading up to that crazy in hindsight round table thing
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:03.300]  that me and Panzerino and a few others got invited to when they reset the said, Hey,
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.480]  we're going to do a Mac.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.660]  We have ideas for an iMac pro and we're going to, we're going to start all over right now
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.020]  with a new Mac pro, which you're probably podcasting on right now.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.020]  Right?
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.060]  I sure am.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:22.060]  There was, I wouldn't say it was a consensus, but certainly a very strong contingent of
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:32.140]  people who thought that Apple was showing Mac OS the door and oddly to me, often based
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:41.140]  on quotes from Tim Cook claiming that he does all of his work on iPads, which to his credit,
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:47.620]  one of the great things about Tim Cook as CEO of Apple is he has seemingly zero ego
[01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:52.340]  whatsoever about the fact that he's not a product person, right?
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:17:01.520]  Like he's replacing arguably the best product person, CEO of all time, certainly in tech.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.460]  And you know, you saw it with Scully, right?
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:10.300]  Scully came from Pepsi and Apple had good years under Scully, but he obviously, you
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:16.140]  know, like the way he kind of spearheaded the Newton and push that out the door seemingly,
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:21.460]  you know, not to psychoanalyze him from afar, but it seemed like, you know, he wanted to
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.420]  put his mark on product.
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.720]  Tim Cook doesn't really have that.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.980]  So I wouldn't take Tim Cook's, I think Tim Cook just likes to say good things about Apple
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.980]  products.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:31.980]  And that's why he says good things about the iPad.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:37.220]  And I'm sure he does use his iPad a lot, but I never ever took it as meaning that Apple
[01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:42.260]  had a vision of pushing the Mac out the door and we'd all be using iPads for everything.
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:51.180]  Well, we should be kind of thankful that Cook didn't want to be that kind of product person
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:57.420]  because one possible vision that a new CEO of Apple post jobs could have had is exactly
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.380]  what everyone thought he was going to do or feared he was going to do, which is just one
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.740]  big unified OS based around the one in the iPhone, because that's our bread and butter
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.620]  now and slowly phase out the Mac.
[01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:11.340]  And if we think of almost any other CEO that would have come in after jobs, if they were
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:15.580]  the type that said, I'm really going to put my stamp on this company by driving it, driving
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:20.860]  it the same way jobs did through product decisions and product vision, that is kind of like the
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.640]  obvious product vision.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.700]  Like if you were to look back at the company and say, okay, if I have to reassess, what
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.660]  should we do?
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.460]  Even Jobs himself has voiced it in the quote that I have no idea where it's from, but it's
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:38.140]  like what I would do is, you know, think about what's going to come next after the Mac.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:39.140]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.780]  What kind of quote am I trying to remember?
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.020]  I know what you're talking about.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:50.020]  It was sort of like milk what they've got for all it's worth and then move on to the
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.020]  next big thing.
[01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.020]  Right.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.260]  He's got a bunch of quotes about not dwelling on your accomplishments and moving on to the
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.260]  next thing.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.660]  But he had one that was even more specific about the Mac.
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:05.540]  And so I feel like that if he had felt like I need to really just change the direction
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:10.100]  like a lot of CEOs assert themselves to sort of put a stamp on the company and make it
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.180]  their own.
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:15.680]  Whatever the previous guy did, especially if he was super famous and super successful,
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.380]  you got to do something different.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:20.980]  Otherwise it just seems like you're steering a ship that, you know, is going in a direction
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.980]  pointed to by somebody else.
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.820]  But Tim Cook hasn't felt that at all, really.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:29.260]  And it's, you know, it's so hard to tell inside Apple, but it feels to me that he has, you
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:33.340]  know, he has things that he cares about and he's always been steering those and continues
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.340]  to steer those.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.860]  But those aren't things related to the products that Apple makes, like, you know, what kind
[01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.520]  of product, how many ports should it be on this laptop?
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.260]  Should we make laptops anymore?
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:43.880]  But like, that's not it.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.040]  It's all about, you know, supply chain.
[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.400]  And I think even the services stuff like the sort of economics and big picture manufacturing
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.720]  supply chain, inventory management, sales channels, all that, like that was always his
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.940]  Ben still is his and that's a strength and he sticks to that.
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:05.740]  And so what that has left, it feels like to me from the outside is the lieutenants on
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:10.520]  down inside Apple, the various, I'm not going to say warring factions, but the various subsets
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:15.480]  of Apple that have their own opinions about product direction have been sort of fighting
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:17.500]  it out through consensus.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.980]  Eventually it was bubbling up to Tim to probably to give a go, no go, yes, no, or point in
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:24.740]  this direction or that, or kick out forestall and keep eye or whatever the big decisions
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:31.020]  are, but still the direction is being set by the strongest factions below Tim in the
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.020]  company.
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.920]  Some of which are populated with old people from next, some of which are populated from
[01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.220]  classic Mac OS long timers, some of which are populated with people who never knew Apple
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.220]  before the iPhone, right?
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:44.940]  And the all, and the iPod people and all of those factions are all mixing together and
[01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:49.640]  fighting it out to try to set a direction as opposed to a top down thing where Tim Cook
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.900]  says one day, you know, the Mac is going in the gutter of the iPad and the iPhone of the
[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:54.900]  future make it happen.
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.420]  Like that didn't happen.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:00.760]  Even the Mac round table thing, I feel like, like the closest Tim Cook came to making a
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.360]  decision was not making a decision to can the Mac, which meant the Mac had to continue.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:11.020]  But then without a strong direction to say, let's make sure that the Mac continues to
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:17.880]  be successful by these criteria, merely continuing to have Macs that the people below him said
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.820]  were the right thing to do for the Mac that, you know, with Tim Cook going, it seems reasonable
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:29.860]  turns out they took a wrong turn and they had to backtrack and do something different.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:35.460]  And I don't think without the outside input, Tim Cook would have necessarily seen anything
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.220]  particularly wrong with the Mac to lead to that round table discussion.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:43.720]  But the customers did and the people who ran all the Mac stuff did.
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.360]  And so, and that sort of, you know, again, probably had to bubble up to Tim and say,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.300]  you know, why are people complaining about the Mac?
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:53.780]  Like it seems fine to me, but apparently some people don't like it, please fix it.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.500]  And then you get the round table.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.620]  Here's the quote from Jobs.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:58.660]  It doesn't have a date.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:04.420]  It's from Goodreads, but it had to be 1994 and 1995 because it wouldn't make any sense
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.420]  before or after.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.420]  Right.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.300]  It had to be before he came back.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:13.500]  If I were running Apple, I would milk the Macintosh for all it's worth and get busy
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.980]  on the next great thing.
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.020]  The PC wars are over, done.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:22.420]  Microsoft won a long time ago, which is funny because now you look back at that, it actually
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.140]  was wrong.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.020]  I mean, but it was right in the way that he meant it.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:30.900]  And if you come back to Apple, the move is not, let's get 90% PC market share, right.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.340]  Which Apple never did and never probably never will do and didn't try to do.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:39.340]  And Apple did get working on the next big thing, whether the iPod, the iPod and eventually
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.340]  the iPhone.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.340]  Right.
[01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.180]  But it also didn't get rid of the Mac.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:48.020]  And part of that, I think, is because, you know, Jobs is baby.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.220]  Part of that is just because Jobs liked Macs, right?
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:54.180]  And so if he got rid of them, he'd have to use a PC and he wouldn't like that.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:58.060]  And he wasn't going to be Tim Cook to get everything done on his iPad.
[01:22:58.060 --> 01:23:02.580]  But you know, it's just like the people at Apple liked the Mac and thought it should
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.900]  continue to be a thing.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.820]  But that was not, you know, and then you can say that wasn't the focus of the company.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.540]  Jobs' big comeback was a Mac, the iMac.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:10.540]  Right.
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.300]  That's turned the company around with a Mac, because in the short period of time, that's
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]  what you've got.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:15.300]  That's what you can do.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:22.060]  So he was absolutely right in the sense that he meant that phrase and acted accordingly,
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:26.020]  but never took the step that people would get from that phrase, which is like, oh, I
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.700]  guess that means he just wants the Mac to go away.
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:30.940]  Steve Jobs absolutely did not want the Mac to go away, and it didn't go away.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.980]  And Tim Cook probably could take it or leave it.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:37.580]  And so it stayed and it floundered a little bit, but now it seems like it's turning around.
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:43.380]  Flash forward to just like two or three WWDCs ago, I think it was right before the introduction
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.800]  of Catalyst.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:50.020]  So it was probably two of them ago.
[01:23:50.020 --> 01:24:01.420]  And Federighi is on stage and has in his introduction to Catalyst the UI kit to make Mac apps framework,
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:08.180]  which is, in other words, a way to port your iOS apps to the Mac with however minimal the
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:12.980]  change is certainly far more minimal than rewriting them in AppKit.
[01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:18.060]  And it was a, are we moving towards a single unified operating system?
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:24.140]  And it's WWDC, they've got bigger screens than they even have at Steve Jobs Theater
[01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:31.480]  and a giant screen with the word no dropping down in an animation.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:36.940]  And even still, lots of people, like, I really felt like that was a moment where Apple really
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.920]  broke a little character and was like, look, we know a lot of you think that's what we're
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.100]  doing.
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:46.180]  That's what Microsoft seems to be doing, but they don't have a phone.
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.180]  We're not doing that.
[01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.540]  We really aren't.
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.380]  And then lots of people are like, yeah, that's what they're doing.
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:55.100]  They're going to just have one operating system and it's going to be iOS.
[01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:59.260]  It feels like there's no way they can refute it and they're trying to, didn't really get
[01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.260]  away with it.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:02.700]  Didn't really do anything to quell it.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:07.620]  Yeah, I mean, again, that's clearly a discussion that had to be had inside Apple.
[01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.140]  It's just the question of what level it's at.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:14.140]  And I feel like that debate of, hey, what should we do with our whole platform story
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:19.420]  probably is the type of thing that took place with, I forget if Bertrand was still the head
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.780]  when this was taking place, but eventually with Federighi, like, whoever's in charge
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:28.460]  of all the software platforms at Apple and all of that person's lieutenants and vice
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.140]  presidents or whatever, you got to hash that out and say, what are we, what's our OS strategy
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:35.500]  for the next 10 years or whatever, what are we going to do?
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.660]  Are we going to merge into one big thing or are we going to keep them separate?
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.140]  And do they have that debate?
[01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:41.860]  And the decision they made is we're going to keep them separate.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:45.380]  And if everyone on the outside is like, oh, you're going to merge, you're going to merge,
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.980]  but people on the outside didn't participate in those debates.
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.740]  And I'm sure that decision was pitched to Tim Cook.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.460]  Tim Cook has to know, hey, what's the deal with the software platform?
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.300]  And they have to say, here's what we've collectively decided and here's why.
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.020]  And Tim Cook has to say, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.480]  Do that or disagree, right?
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.960]  But I don't think Tim Cook is up there saying, I have the vision for our software platforms
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]  for the next 15 years.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]  Here's what we're going to do.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.960]  We're not going to merge them.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.860]  We're not going to merge them or whatever, right?
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.680]  But even today, the reason he had to say that is with the Catalyst thing.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.160]  I think on ATP, I described the introduction of Catalyst as an extinction-level event for
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.380]  Cocoa or for AppKit at that point, because there are so many more UIKit developers.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:27.220]  And okay, we're not merging OSs, but there's two angles in that.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.540]  One, the OSs were never really unmerged.
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:35.460]  Like the whole point is that the iPhone OS was, quote, unquote, jobs based on OS 10,
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.660]  whatever the hell OS 10 was in his mind, right?
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.860]  It's Darwin under there.
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:39.860]  It's BSD Darwin.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:41.260]  It's the foundations of the thing.
[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.260]  The iPad runs it.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.260]  The Mac runs it.
[01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.260]  The phone runs it, right?
[01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:48.740]  The things built on top of it vary, but there's tons of common components.
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:55.120]  If Apple had, let's pretend Apple had built the iPhone based on that PixOS platform that
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.440]  ran the iPod, right?
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:01.460]  If they had done that, and then at some point they had said, guess what?
[01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:03.820]  We're not using PixOS on the iPhone anymore.
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.240]  Now we're going to be using a variant on OS 10.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:10.140]  The story would have been Apple merges Mac and iOS operating systems, but because they
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:16.600]  started with that basically merged foundation, now what we say when we merge is like, well,
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.300]  it's just the same operating system like Windows 8.
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.940]  It's just Windows 8, Windows 8, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows 10, Windows 10.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:22.660]  It's just the same name and it runs everywhere.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:26.300]  And it's like, you're really starting to get into a place where the differences start to
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.300]  become more academic.
[01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:32.620]  Yes, we all know if you're a developer, AppKit versus UIKit versus SwiftUI, and that muddies
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:36.980]  the water, and the operating systems themselves have details that are different, and the phone
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:39.380]  doesn't use swap, right?
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:44.820]  There's so many things that are different, but fundamentally, Apple doesn't have a split
[01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:45.820]  OS strategy.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.620]  They don't even have a split OS strategy like Microsoft used to when it had NT versus the
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:51.200]  95 thing, right?
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:57.380]  They have always had a single OS foundationally strategy across their entire line, and it's
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.320]  just the level where it varies is the part where the tension is.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:08.180]  And on that level, Apple has been quote-unquote merging them in one particular direction by
[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.080]  making it possible to write UIKit on the Mac, whereas you couldn't before, by making it
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:17.580]  possible to literally run iOS applications on your Mac by using the same CPU architecture
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.820]  on the Mac as they do.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.900]  And notice the direction that arrow is always going.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:24.180]  It's always going, whatever we were doing on the phone and the iPad, bring that over
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:27.980]  to the Mac, and much, much less of the opposite direction, right?
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:33.460]  So this whole debate about merging, I think it means something in people's minds.
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:38.280]  But from a technical perspective, like from Federighi's point of view, they've been marching
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:45.860]  along another fairly obvious technological path to basically leverage their assets.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.240]  We have millions of developers who know UIKit.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.500]  Why shouldn't we let them write Mac apps more easily?
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.860]  We're really good at making CPUs for our phones and our iPads.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.220]  Why shouldn't we use them in the Mac?
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.940]  It'll make our Macs better.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:01.260]  While at the same time not saying, oh, you're going to turn on your Mac, and it's just going
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.380]  to be like, you know, Launchpad, and it's just going to look like a springboard filling
[01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:07.380]  your whole screen, and you're going to touch your Mac and do all that stuff, right?
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.500]  That's the level consumers think.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:12.060]  So when that big no comes down, it's trying to tell people, it's not going to be a dock,
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:16.220]  it's still going to be a menu bar, you're going to have a mouse, it's a Mac, right?
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:21.140]  Meanwhile, every single technical person at Apple is essentially taking the best parts
[01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:24.980]  of all the OSs and combining them together to make them closer and closer to each other.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.580]  I mean, for crying out loud, running phone apps natively on your Mac, right?
[01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:32.420]  And yet they can still have that big slide that says, no, we're not merging them, right?
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:36.240]  So it's really just a question of what level are we communicating, right?
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.260]  That no is communicating at one level, and I think it's saying the right thing for people
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:41.440]  operating that level.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:46.440]  But if you're a developer, looking at how the OSs have been evolving towards each other,
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:52.240]  let's say, that doesn't conflict with the no and is in many ways comforting, but it
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:53.900]  does have ramifications.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:57.640]  And so the ramifications I was getting at with the extinction level event is there are
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:02.320]  so many more iOS programmers, and if you can use UIKit to write apps for the Mac, how long
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:06.640]  is it going to be before there are fewer and fewer people writing Mac apps with AppKit?
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.740]  And then the third one in the mix is there, well, is anyone using either of those APIs
[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:13.080]  or they're just using Electron doing everything with web apps to make everything cross-platform?
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:18.460]  So that battle is yet to be hashed out, it is going on right now, this is a hot war on
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.220]  all of our Macs.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.700]  What API do I use to write apps for this Mac?
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.860]  What API is used to write the apps that I use every single day?
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:30.240]  And that still needs to sort itself out.
[01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.480]  Meanwhile, Apple can continue and insist, no, we're not merging the OSs, and no, we're
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.540]  not taking away your menu bar and your dock, right, and the finder's still there.
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.260]  But that war is happening whether you want it or not.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:47.880]  Yeah, I think the way I see it, and I think it's what people miss, is that it's less of
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:52.560]  a technical thing and more of a philosophical thing, that philosophically the Mac is still
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:59.140]  a Mac, even if technically it's more and more alike, you know, processor architecture, UI
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:04.560]  kit, now being a first-class citizen that you can write apps for the Mac, and literally
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.260]  being able to just double-click an iPhone app on an Apple Silicon Mac and it launches,
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:11.260]  you know.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:16.660]  Which, again, you don't, do you have, what do you have, a DTK, what's your Apple Silicon
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:17.660]  story?
[01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:21.740]  I've got an M1 MacBook Air and I've still got a DTK because Apple won't tell me how
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:22.740]  to return it.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.380]  They know how to make people angry.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:32.580]  Yeah, we'll be talking to you in a few weeks, just go find the box now, but.
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:37.660]  One of the things about the double-clicking, you know, just launching iOS apps, I guess
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.200]  they're not really iPhone apps, they're iPad apps right now.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:46.220]  If it's an iPhone-only app, I don't think it works, I think it has to be iPad.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:49.780]  This tells you how much I've used that feature on the M1 MacBook Air, because my son uses
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.180]  that computer, and I always forget, is it the iPhone ones that run on the iPad ones?
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:56.340]  Technically speaking, there's no reason it couldn't be both of them, but I don't, is
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:57.340]  it just the iPad ones?
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.420]  No, it's just iPad ones.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:02.760]  But there's also, it's also the case that for me personally, so few of the apps I use
[01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:07.140]  are iPhone-only, but that's, you know, I don't know if that's the only reason why Instagram
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:08.140]  doesn't work.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:09.580]  Just does Instagram, I was about to say that.
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.580]  Right.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.220]  I'm trying to think of other apps I use that don't have both, it's just sort of a dying
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:15.220]  breed.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:16.820]  Maybe, maybe your banking app.
[01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:18.400]  Yeah, probably, I don't know.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.980]  But I actually don't even use, my banking app is awful, because I have, at the same
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:25.380]  bank, I have a business account and a personal account, and the website...
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:26.380]  You can't swap between them.
[01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:29.900]  Well, yeah, the web, yeah, you can't swap between them, whereas the website, you just
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:32.460]  log out and you log in with your other, you know, saved password.
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:33.900]  Who's going to have more than one banking app?
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.740]  I opened up a business banking account recently, too, and I picked the bank that was like,
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.260]  that I can walk to from my house.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:41.260]  That's exactly what I did.
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.860]  Because I'm like, oh, that'll be super convenient.
[01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:44.860]  And their app sucks.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:49.100]  They should have, like, those big banks that have a whole jillion dollars under these giant
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:50.100]  national chains.
[01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:55.340]  I assume they have better apps, but this rinky dink local bank just got one poor iOS programmer
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.260]  that worked on this once, like, five years ago, and that's it.
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.960]  It's the, my bank's website is pretty good.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:05.660]  It's good enough that I don't complain, but the app is not as good as the web.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:09.500]  But I have to use the app to, to cash checks with the camera.
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:15.540]  But when they added that, they also added, it was like a $400 limit, like, and...
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:19.900]  Yeah, that's another thing I didn't, for my business account, like, I set up this business
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:24.260]  account and I should have asked more closely what all the limits are, because a lot of
[01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:27.780]  things are tedious when there are limits and, like, number of transactions per day and maximum
[01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:36.660]  amount of the transactions and, yeah, live and learn.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:43.060]  But I do think, I, one of the interesting things about that feature is, to me, to me,
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:48.140]  it doesn't work very well, and I wrote about it when I wrote about the M1 Macs, that, like,
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:54.060]  the HBO app scrolls terribly, which apparently was maybe my fault because I turned on the
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:58.980]  weird feature where you get, like, multi-touch support, and if you turn that off, scrolling
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:02.060]  works a little better.
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:06.140]  But still, the HBO app, which you would think would be an app you might want to use because,
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:12.180]  you know, watching, you know, they don't have a Mac app, proper Mac app, you might want
[01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:18.220]  to watch your HBO shows, and the app ought to be better than the website, but you couldn't
[01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.220]  go full screen.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.220]  It was crazy.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:24.940]  Like, why, you know, of all the things that can't go full screen, why wouldn't a video
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:25.940]  app?
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.140]  But that's because they didn't really make it for that.
[01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:32.140]  It was just, here, we'll let your iPad app run, and the iPad app thinks that the window
[01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:38.460]  is the screen, and so it only expands the video to fill the window, but the window can't
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:41.020]  go full, et cetera, it's just bad.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:46.660]  Anyway, several months in now, here we are towards the middle of February, end of February,
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:51.380]  I don't hear anybody ever talking about running those iOS apps on their M1 Macs.
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:54.820]  I mean, it's kind of like the first round of Catalyst where all the apps were scaled
[01:34:54.820 --> 01:35:00.500]  by, like, you know, 1.7% or 1.3% or whatever it was, I forget, like, they weren't quite
[01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.860]  the right size and everything was a little janky, and then now there's the Mac native
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:07.580]  mode where you get to one-to-one scaling.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:11.260]  Trying to bridge the divide of these APIs without breaking compatibility is tricky,
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:15.940]  so that's why it wasn't an overnight, you know, an overnight cascade of iOS apps.
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:22.820]  But I really think that the real competition is these, you know, web-based apps, Electron-based
[01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:23.820]  cross-platform apps.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:29.140]  Like, so many of the apps that we use every day, you know, I think about this every time
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.940]  I have a podcast with someone who's around for a long time, I just think about all the
[01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.540]  hours I spent on my computer with no internet connection.
[01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:39.700]  It seems like most of my life it wasn't, but like, none of those apps had anything to do
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:40.700]  with the network.
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:46.380]  Now, pretty much every single app I do every day is useless without the internet.
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:47.380]  Web browser?
[01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:48.380]  Useless.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:49.380]  Slack?
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:50.380]  Useless.
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:51.380]  iMessage?
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:52.380]  Useless.
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:53.380]  Like, Skype?
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:54.380]  Useless.
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.380]  Like, these applications do not function without a network connection.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:01.860]  So in that world, it's no surprise that these cross-platform, you know, web-based frameworks
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:06.700]  that run seemingly half of the apps I use these days are, you know, are a thing.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:08.500]  And so that is Apple's real competition.
[01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:13.900]  So even though old-timers are fretting about AppKit versus UIKit versus SwiftUI, Apple
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:16.140]  should be fretting about Electron versus everything.
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:17.140]  Yeah.
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:18.760]  Let me take a break, because I want to pick up from that.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.760]  It's too big a topic.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.500]  But let me thank our third sponsor.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:26.940]  It's a fellow ATP sponsor, FlatFile.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:31.440]  Nearly everyone has dealt with formatting CSV or Excel files so the data can be correctly
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:33.300]  imported into their application.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.640]  It's a pain.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.100]  Companies of all sizes spend an exorbitant amount of effort trying to fix this problem.
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.840]  Typical solutions include CSV templates, emailing Excel files back and forth through each other,
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:48.020]  or hiring expensive implementation teams.
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.980]  FlatFile has the solution.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:56.140]  They call the service Concierge, and it's a no-code collaborative workspace for onboarding
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.080]  structured data from spreadsheets, that sort of thing.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.260]  You invite your customers.
[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:07.980]  They can join your employees, your customers, to securely import, format, and merge spreadsheet
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:08.980]  data.
[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.420]  They don't have to fumble with weird uploads of files to FTP servers.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.820]  You don't have to email sensitive Excel files back and forth and have them all, different
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:20.780]  versions of them, all as email attachments, none of that.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:26.300]  FlatFile's mission is to help companies spend less time formatting and importing spreadsheet
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:31.860]  data into their applications and just spend more time using it and more developer time
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:35.880]  not on importing data, but just actually working on features.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:38.240]  Are you curious how they can help your business?
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.500]  Visit them at flatfile.io, flatfile.io.
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:47.300]  They've been sponsoring ATP for a while, now they're sponsoring my show.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.700]  I wonder why it took them so long.
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:52.820]  Seems like a mutual audience.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.860]  Must be the funny name.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:56.020]  Maybe.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.020]  I agree with you.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:38:01.880]  I think that the existential threat to the Mac, I mean, for decades, I mean, literally
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.740]  since its inception, everybody always thought the threat to the Mac, that the extinction
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:12.020]  threat was the PC, it was DOS, I was going to say Windows, but back in the day, it was
[01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:14.660]  DOS, then it was Windows.
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:23.660]  I mean, it was deafening by 1995, right, when Windows 95 came out, which was actually better
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:33.580]  looking and worked better, and Apple was mismanaged, to make a long story very short, and sort
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:41.740]  of lost in the woods at a management level and at an engineering level had failed on
[01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:47.380]  several major, you know, they needed a next generation OS, and their engineering efforts
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:51.100]  in those regards had failed.
[01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:56.420]  And it's easy to, you know, you forget, it's like Apple hasn't had like a failure like
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:03.740]  that in a very long time, but I mean, these were major operating system initiatives.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:07.220]  Number one, it's a little bit telling that there were several of them, and they were
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:15.900]  concurrent, remember pink, intelligent pink, Copeland, Copeland, Gershwin, wasn't Gershwin
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:22.220]  the one that was going to come after Copeland, and you know, times are different, they blabbed
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:28.000]  about them, showed screenshots, released screenshots of them to Macworld, published a book sitting
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.520]  on the shelf next to me, Mac OS 8 revealed, describes an operating system that Apple never
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.700]  released, instead they released a totally different operating system also called Mac
[01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:41.700]  OS 8.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:50.260]  You know, that was, in some sense, for a brief period of time there, 95, 96, even after the
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:56.260]  next, as I call it, the reunification, and they acquired Next and had therefore owned
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:01.420]  a decent starting point for a next generation operating system, it was still years away
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:08.500]  from actually being usable as something to offer to the Mac community that was keeping
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.500]  Apple going.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:14.340]  And they had one false start there too, because remember Rhapsody was the first run at that,
[01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.660]  and that didn't work, and then they released the weird Mac OS X server that would, you
[01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:22.100]  know, no relation to the future operating system of the same name, but then the second
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.340]  try they got it.
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.340]  Right.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:27.100]  Yeah, maybe, arguably the third try, really, right?
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:32.660]  I, Mac OS X server wasn't really, or whatever they called it, what did it, was it just called?
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.100]  Rhapsody was the project, right?
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:38.940]  That was like Mac OS X without carbon, essentially, and with a different idea of the UI, it was
[01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:42.620]  the next, it was the next-ies take on what the next generation operating system would
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:47.060]  be, and the Mac market said, no thanks, and then they released Mac OS X server, which
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:51.340]  was essentially Rhapsody, but the server version of it, just because I feel like someone probably
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:54.060]  had that on their thing as like, oh, we should just get this out the door and accomplish
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:59.340]  it, but then they said, no, the new strategy is Mac OS X, and that was the one that stuck,
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:03.100]  and that was the one with Aqua, and the whole nine yards, and that was the one with carbon,
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.100]  right?
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.100]  Aqua and carbon were the, and you know, the porting of many more Mac APIs, like Quick
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.220]  Time and stuff, were the big things that differentiated Rhapsody from Mac OS X, but essentially they
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:16.260]  said, we took a run at it with Rhapsody, and nobody bit, and they basically did the same
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:21.900]  thing again, but with a few particularly strategic and important changes that they got away with.
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:24.980]  It's kind of like they tried to do Copeland, and no one, and no one stuck, so they did
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:28.620]  like the same thing as Copeland, but with like a different skin, and one or two new
[01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:31.560]  APIs, and it worked.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:37.020]  It was interesting, though, seeing something that looked, because the skin of it, the theme,
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:44.660]  whatever you want to call it, was the Mac OS 9 Platinum, Platinum, but was better, right?
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:50.060]  It was, it was like they'd improved a couple of the elements, and funny enough, from where
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:56.620]  Mac OS X wound up being with Aqua, it was snappier, it was, it was a very snappy interface.
[01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:02.940]  Memory protection, the multitasking, but it was this weird looking next thing, and even
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:07.460]  in the early versions of Mac OS X, you could switch the UI back to the next UI.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:12.100]  Right, right, which I think was what, I think the people who actually used it did that,
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:16.340]  whereas like we Mac nerds were like, well, let's just kick the tires on this thing and
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:18.740]  see where they're going.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:22.420]  But there were a few years there where it did look like, yeah, the Mac might just get,
[01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.260]  just become one of those things like the Amiga, like, remember this, remember the Mac?
[01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:28.220]  Oh, yeah, that was a good one.
[01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:34.620]  But then once they got their feet under them, and Mac OS X was clearly, you know, as rough
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:38.500]  around the edges as it was when it finally shipped, it was clearly going in the right
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:43.500]  direction and made progress very steadily, and it's like, yeah, there's a future here.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:48.100]  The PC really was never again the threat to the Mac.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:58.180]  I mean, the threat to the Mac, in my mind, clearly is the rise of web apps and the generational
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:05.660]  change in terms of how younger people view apps, or what they do on computers.
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:09.700]  Yeah, or whether they want to use a computer at all for anything ever.
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:10.700]  Right.
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:16.540]  Yeah, so I saw an OS market share pie chart recently, I don't know, was this on your side?
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:17.540]  Was it?
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:18.540]  I don't know.
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.540]  I don't think it was me.
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:26.540]  But anyway, it was the current snapshot of quote unquote desktop OS market share.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:30.460]  If you didn't see the same thing as me, what's your guess on the breakdown?
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:35.420]  Well, who is it supposedly pulling the market as a whole?
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.740]  Yeah, I was like, I don't know if it was installed base or active users, but it was a current
[01:43:39.740 --> 01:43:44.780]  snapshot of the market of like, how many people out there it was, it was basically OS market
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.660]  share.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:47.660]  And are we counting?
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:50.460]  What are we counting Chrome as Chrome up Chromebooks?
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.460]  Are they counting as PCs?
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.460]  As desktop?
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.460]  Yeah.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:44:06.840]  I would guess 7% Mac 50 50, and the rest split evenly between Windows and Chrome.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:13.800]  So like 40 47 47 and seven.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.180]  You had a more pessimistic picture than I did.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:19.260]  Of course, I don't actually have this URL handy.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:23.780]  But the the upshot of it was that Chrome OS had just overtaken the Mac.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:25.140]  Oh, just the Mac.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.540]  I thought maybe it was up there with Windows.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.540]  I don't know.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:30.660]  I just know there's a gazillion Chromebooks out there.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:34.940]  Chrome OS had had overtaken the Mac here and there going back and forth a few years, but
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.180]  now it's like decisively ahead of the Mac.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:40.420]  So it's like, but it wasn't that much bigger than the Mac.
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.420]  And then there's Windows.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:42.420]  Yeah, I'm crazy.
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:44.940]  Now that I think about it, it was an IDC thing.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:48.260]  I bet if you Google and it was IDC now that I think about it, I saw this.
[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.860]  It flashed by by somewhere on my news the other day.
[01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:53.540]  Yeah, I did see that.
[01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.100]  But it's such so different.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.320]  Like, you know, what's funny?
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.180]  We don't talk about market share anymore.
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:02.700]  Market share used to be like something that Mac users had to obsess over because it was
[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.380]  always the argument as to why the platform was about to disappear.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:12.340]  Because we would talk about market share if it wasn't for one weird thing about it.
[01:45:12.340 --> 01:45:16.900]  About iOS, which is that that's where all the people who spend money are, right?
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:21.040]  If people spent money equally, if like if you got the same number of dollars per year
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.180]  out of an iOS user as you did out of an Android user, we'd be talking about market share all
[01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:26.180]  the time.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:29.340]  Well, and not just the money, it's the influence too.
[01:45:29.340 --> 01:45:36.340]  Like I mentioned this week that Clubhouse, the hot new social media app is iOS only for
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:37.340]  now.
[01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.940]  And they've just announced that with their funding round they just raised, they're going
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:42.820]  to start work on an Android app.
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.820]  I mean, no.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.180]  And again, it's exactly like what Instagram did 10 years ago where they were iPhone only
[01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:54.780]  while they were new and fluid and wanted one thing to work on while they were really changing
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:57.500]  things around and figuring out what it was.
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:46:02.200]  And then once it got big, then they went to Android and you know, so that they could let
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.820]  everybody in the world join the network.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:09.060]  And Clubhouse is sort of doing the same thing and it would never work.
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.580]  Clubhouse nobody would have heard of it if it was Android only.
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:15.980]  I mean, I'm not sure if we have a good test case for that, but it's definitely true that
[01:46:15.980 --> 01:46:22.280]  like with things being equal, like in the Windows and Mac days, despite the price difference
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:26.580]  of Mac hardware and all the other stuff and the vast differences in the platforms, the
[01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.860]  user bases were seen as more or less equally valuable.
[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:31.860]  They were different.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.780]  Maybe you had more of the creative people and desktop publishing on the Mac, but on
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:38.060]  the PC you had the quote unquote business people and the regular workers and they were
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.120]  more or less equally valuable.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:44.540]  But that's not the case in the mobile world, right?
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:50.580]  So on the desktop side, the iPod could be introduced as a Mac only thing, but it would
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:52.940]  only get big when it went to Windows.
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.700]  That's not true of Clubhouse.
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:58.660]  Clubhouse can get big being a Mac only thing and then also expand to Windows.
[01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:02.220]  It's not like Clubhouse is waiting around saying, boy, once Clubhouse comes to Android,
[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.220]  it'll finally get big.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:04.220]  No, no one says that.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:07.900]  It's totally able to get big just on iOS.
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:10.840]  Everyone does acknowledge that eventually it will have to go to Android.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.500]  So it's not like you don't need Android anymore, but it's so different.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:20.660]  And that disparity is why people don't talk about market share as much in the mobile space,
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:26.580]  because iOS has this smaller market share, but this massively concentrated value of all
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:31.020]  the best customers, essentially all the ones that spend all the money and everything.
[01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:35.420]  But if not, people will be like, oh, iOS, what is it going to do?
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.380]  It's market share against Android.
[01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:41.020]  It barely matches it or exceeds it in the U.S. and is way behind in the rest of the
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.020]  world.
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.580]  And no one says that because Apple keeps showing through the numbers like we have all the customers
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:47.320]  who give us money, right?
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:48.860]  So no one else is making money.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:53.860]  And however much market share numbers have always been a little bullshitty, because it's
[01:47:53.860 --> 01:48:01.080]  always, you know, IDC's methodology is different than some other analyst outfit's methodology
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.620]  and well, how can they be different?
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:07.780]  You know, ballpark, though, they were always, you know, they could be estimated, whereas
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:12.620]  nobody can really estimate iOS's influence share.
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:15.180]  But that's really what we're all thinking about, right?
[01:48:15.180 --> 01:48:20.740]  And we know that iOS has influence share that far outweighs its market share.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:25.380]  And that's the whole reason Clubhouse can become a sensation, iOS only, and the whole
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:31.140]  reason Instagram became a billion dollar acquisition by Facebook, mostly.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.460]  I think they launched their Android app right before the Facebook acquisition.
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:40.860]  But effectively, when Facebook bought them, they were still iOS only 10 years ago.
[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:45.300]  And it was, you know, I'm sure it wasn't even a big deal.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.860]  Like when they were talking about the acquisition.
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:52.300]  Remember when people thought Facebook overspent?
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.820]  A billion dollars?
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:54.820]  Facebook's nuts.
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:55.820]  That's crazy.
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:01.220]  I mean, I kind of think like I understand why people think that they overspent because
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:05.300]  I think Instagram itself has has shown this.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:11.460]  When Facebook recognized that Instagram was going to be a thing, you don't have to buy
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:16.440]  the company to deal with that in the same way that Instagram or Facebook didn't have
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.700]  to buy Snapchat.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.180]  Once they recognize what Snapchat was doing was going to be a thing.
[01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:22.120]  They just added stories to Instagram.
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.500]  So Facebook does that strategy sometimes too.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.080]  Sometimes you can buy the company.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:28.440]  Sometimes you can just do the same thing the company's doing.
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:32.060]  And honestly, a social network that shares photos, Facebook could have implemented that
[01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:33.060]  themselves.
[01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:37.180]  And so the people, some people saying that they overspent for Instagram, I think aren't
[01:49:37.180 --> 01:49:39.820]  necessarily saying that, oh, Instagram wasn't worth that much money.
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:45.060]  Saying you could have potentially gotten the same results for way less money with a little
[01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:48.620]  bit more risk if you just added, you know, if you just did an Instagram clone.
[01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.620]  Right.
[01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:50.620]  And the same with Instagram.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:56.380]  They chapped Snapchat Stories clone in its own app and got most of the value out of it.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:59.340]  Buying Instagram, though, is a lot safer because then you don't have the risk of like, well,
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:03.140]  we can't rebuild the social network and what if Instagram is too big and all that other
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:04.140]  stuff.
[01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:06.020]  So I kind of see the point of the overpaying.
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:08.520]  But honestly, if you've got the money, it's way less risk.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.700]  So just buy them out.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:17.660]  Which, you know, taking us back to the web app thing on Mac, it's it's nowhere near and
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:23.340]  maybe someday it will be on mobile, but I kind of don't think so.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:27.900]  And I know that it leads us into antitrust arguments, whether they're legal or even just
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:35.420]  philosophical about Apple's control over the fact that, you know, WebKit is the only web
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:39.000]  rendering engine allowable on iOS.
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.300]  And all of the things that people might want to do with web apps that you save to your
[01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:49.640]  desktop are limited because of the capabilities that web apps have on iOS, which are enforced
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:57.660]  by Apple, which you can easily argue cynically is all about just maintaining the primacy
[01:50:57.660 --> 01:51:04.260]  of native apps that happen to go through the App Store and only the App Store on iOS.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:13.340]  But talking about the Mac here on this show, it's clear that the primacy of true native
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:19.100]  Mac apps, not just a thing that you double clip, like Slack, for example, is not a native
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.100]  Mac app.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:24.340]  I mean, it's an app and you run it, but it's not a Mac app, right?
[01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:25.340]  Not even close.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.060]  And, you know, just how many people do things?
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.080]  You know, my son does all of his work.
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.640]  As far as I know, he wouldn't even know how to use anything other than Google Docs to
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.500]  write a paper for school.
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.260]  I don't even think he's ever launched pages.
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:44.900]  I'll bet if I launch pages on his Mac, it would give me the first run dialogue like
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:46.900]  welcome to pages.
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:57.300]  Yeah, I think this is part of the whole reframing of what a computer is for you from the age
[01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.700]  of, you know, when I was talking about using a computer that didn't have a network connection,
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:01.700]  it ran applications.
[01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:04.740]  And that was the whole deal, right?
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:11.540]  And now it seems more like every part of the software and hardware platform of a desktop
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:18.820]  computer is there to give you tools to manage the complexity that is the Internet.
[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:23.420]  So every one of these windows on your screen is, again, a portal instead of a porthole,
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:26.700]  but a portal into the Internet.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:31.820]  And the operating system's job is to let you deal with that, to have web browsers that
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:37.060]  let you deal with web pages, to all those services like Slack and Discord or, you know,
[01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:41.540]  even message services or even Skype or any of these things that are portals into the
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:47.740]  wider Internet, put some fancy Chrome around it, which is what I always thought the Chrome
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:48.740]  web browser was.
[01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:54.080]  I don't know if this is the truth behind that name, but I always thought it was such a clever
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.860]  way to acknowledge that this is just the Chrome around where the real action is happening.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:00.920]  The real action is happening on the web through web apps, right?
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:07.260]  And so there will always be value in the operating system and all that machinery to let you deal
[01:53:07.260 --> 01:53:08.260]  with that.
[01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:12.420]  It's the reason why many of us prefer working on Macs to iPads, even if we're doing the
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:18.540]  same thing, if we're all using just email and, you know, web browsing and things like
[01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:22.900]  Slack and instant message and all those things are available on iPad and on the Mac, what's
[01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:23.900]  the difference?
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.100]  The Mac is letting us manage that complexity in a different way that some of us find more
[01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:31.100]  comfortable and flexible, so that's what we do and vice versa, right?
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:36.420]  And so, you know, setting aside, how is that Chrome built up?
[01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:38.960]  How is that functionality built up?
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.140]  I don't think anyone is arguing that the thing they're giving us access to is the Internet.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:48.340]  And you really get into the weeds when you say, well, if we had a native Slack application,
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:52.620]  they would be receiving JSON blobs or something through an API from the Slack servers and
[01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:57.060]  they would be rendering that using like, you know, an NSTable view if it was an AppKit
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:02.060]  app or whatever, as opposed to receiving those JSON blobs through JavaScript and rendering
[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:07.260]  them into an HTML DOM to make the, you know, scrolling view and argue over and over again
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:08.260]  what those differences are.
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:15.700]  But like in the end, no one is arguing that Slack as a service, as a, you know, an Internet-powered
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:20.620]  service of communication that happens elsewhere and that we were just merely giving a glimpse
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.220]  into through a user interface.
[01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.480]  No one says that's going away.
[01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:27.980]  So it's, you know, that's, that is a much bigger change, a much more important change
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:32.620]  than arguing about whether it's an HTML DOM on this side or whether it's UIKit or whether
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:33.620]  it's AppKit.
[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:40.340]  Yeah, I think it's the danger I see to Apple and the Mac is that it makes the Mac far less
[01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:41.540]  sticky though.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:47.280]  Like it's way, it would be way easier for my, in fact, that's why he has, you know,
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:53.180]  my son has a MacBook that he does most of his work stuff on and he has this gaming PC,
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:58.660]  but he switches back and forth between them in a way because, you know, like he could,
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:03.980]  he can just do his work on, you know, and it's exactly the promise of web apps, right?
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:09.860]  Like if he wants to use his gaming PC to write the homework paper, it's the same login to
[01:55:09.860 --> 01:55:10.860]  Google docs.
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:15.940]  I mean, that's, that's the promise, but the thing that would never appeal to me about
[01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:19.580]  it is I'm so, my fingers work the Mac way.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:23.020]  I expect the menus to work the Mac way.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:29.220]  I could never enjoy using Google docs to write even a sentence.
[01:55:29.220 --> 01:55:36.820]  I mean, I thought like that's, but people, I'm old and I'm, I studied the Mac and know
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:37.820]  it inside.
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:41.700]  I know the Zen of the Macintosh way of using applications.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:45.700]  If you tell me a standard menu command, I can tell you what the shortcut is supposed
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:47.060]  to be.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.500]  And it always bothers me when the shortcuts are different and when some, you know, like
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:53.140]  who wrote this app, have you ever used a Mac?
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:55.740]  Yeah, it's, it's not just habit though.
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:58.380]  Like I said, it's the philosophy of how this stuff works.
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:03.060]  It's kind of, you know, think of it in analogies of like physical world, things of someone
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:07.300]  who's got a workshop and they're making tables and chairs out of wood, right?
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.780]  And those, all the tools, their work bench and all their power tools and all their hand
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.500]  tools and you know, how everything is arranged in their workshop, like those are their tools
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.780]  of the trade.
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.620]  Everyone's making chairs and tables, right?
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:20.820]  They've got legs on them.
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:23.820]  You know, there's basically a chair is a chair, a table is a table and it's different degrees
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.580]  of fanciness, but that's the job to be done.
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:31.060]  But you can have a workshop with a CNC milling machine and all sorts of fancy stuff, or you
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.160]  can have a workshop with only hand tools, but in the end you're all making chairs.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:38.060]  So you're all writing that paper and it's just arguing about how we're going to get
[01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.060]  that job done.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:44.460]  And in terms of the stickiness, like what's the stickiness of one particular table saw
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:51.900]  or a chisel versus, you know, a milling machine versus, you know, like various degrees of
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:55.700]  automation and all the different tools, right?
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:00.520]  It's not like it was in the old days where not only was the Mac, you know, just a set
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.160]  of chisels for you to make a thing, but it's like you'd be using an application that literally
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.380]  didn't exist anywhere.
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:10.020]  Like where are you going to get a WYSIWYG word processor that you can use on your computer
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.520]  and print and hold up your screen, it looks the same as what you just typed.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.500]  That didn't exist until the Mac brought it to people, right?
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.020]  That was stickiness in terms of, well, you can do that or you can use a typewriter or
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.860]  you can print on your Apple II where everything's in capital letters, like it's just, it was,
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:25.420]  there was no contest.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:30.020]  As the, you know, competition has moved computers closer and closer to each other and functionality,
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:34.960]  I feel like what the stickiness is is, well, why do you like this kind of drill instead
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:35.960]  of that kind?
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.260]  And the stickiness of the drill is not because there's no other drills that you can get,
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:41.100]  because this is the best drill, right?
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:45.260]  And what is the best platform through which even something similar, what is the best platform
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.740]  through which you can use Google docs, even if Google docs, quote unquote wins in terms
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.900]  of the word processor, where does Google docs run the best?
[01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:55.260]  What system gives you the best way to deal with the multiple windows and multiple tabs,
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.260]  right?
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:58.860]  What system is the most stable, has the best performance, has the best battery life, like
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:57:59.860]  all these criteria.
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:04.060]  And it seems it's less lock any kind of in terms of like, well, you can't go anywhere
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:06.620]  else because we're the only people who've got Mac, right.
[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:13.240]  But it's in a way, a more honest kind of stickiness in that you keep using the tool that you find
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:17.460]  the best to get this job done, even though you know, you can go somewhere else to do
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:19.460]  the exact same thing.
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.900]  And so it's probably less comfortable for Apple, but I'm completely comfortable with
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:24.460]  Apple competing at that level.
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:31.380]  I'm stealing here from my dithering calling Ben Thompson, but he he keenly observed when
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:37.480]  the M1 Mac shipped and got these reviews and showed this truly breakthrough in battery
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:42.900]  life and performance that, that it was no longer this trade off where, okay, you can
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:49.300]  have fast and it runs hot and eats the battery up, or you can run slow and it'll run cool
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:50.680]  and the battery will last long.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:56.700]  And instead you've got these Macs that run faster than almost all, certainly all of the
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:59:03.700]  consumer level Mac books and low end Mac minis that they replaced that were Intel based,
[01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:09.580]  they run faster and far more efficiently and you get crazy long battery life.
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:15.100]  And you know, double checking with my fellow reviewers, like Jason Snell and Joanna Stern,
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:18.400]  it was like, we had problems making the fans come on.
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:21.460]  You know, it's like, what do I have to do?
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:23.660]  They're supposed to be a fan in this Mac book, bro.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:27.740]  I can't make it come on.
[01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:32.460]  So the, the keen observation there is that when Apple was on Intel, they literally were
[01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:38.340]  competing only on the merits of the software platform because their hardware was literally
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:39.340]  not the same.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:42.500]  It's not like they, Macs were just...
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:43.940]  They weren't competing on hardware performance.
[01:59:43.940 --> 01:59:48.900]  I feel like they were competing on hardware, like form factor, quality, product design
[01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:49.900]  like this.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:54.940]  I heard Ben say that I think it was somewhat discounting the reasons we all like Macs,
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:58.820]  like if, you know, as opposed to a PC, it's like, you're not going to get anything that
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:02.220]  does better performance and doesn't get better battery life, probably, although the OS was
[02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:07.680]  a minor help there as well, but certainly their hardware was nicer and, you know, potentially
[02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.820]  sturdier or more reliable, whatever.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:15.980]  And like a great example of the Apple magic in the midst of the Intel Mac era would be
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:24.580]  when the 5k iMac debuted and there was no way to drive a 5k display over a single video
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.660]  connection.
[02:00:25.660 --> 02:00:30.980]  And so they, they like just did things to, to make two video connections, drive the whole
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:31.980]  display.
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:35.820]  And they made one integrated product and even, even on the laptop front, obviously they're,
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:37.660]  you know, they're getting the same Intel chips as everyone else.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:41.580]  So that seemed like they don't have any hardware differentiation, but their software is a differentiation.
[02:00:41.580 --> 02:00:46.360]  Do you remember the early days when people would take an Intel Apple laptop and they
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:50.300]  would do a battery test on it, running Mac OS 10, and then they would put a windows on
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:54.060]  it and do a battery test and windows would slaughter the battery because Mac OS 10 had
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:56.300]  way better power management.
[02:00:56.300 --> 02:01:00.620]  That was a, you know, so like the heart of the quote unquote hardware was the same.
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.240]  It's literally the same computer, but the OS was able to leverage it better in the same
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:10.140]  way that Safari competes with Chrome on the Mac by being better about battery life.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.780]  They're both looking at the same web.
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:13.780]  They're both running the same web technologies.
[02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:17.920]  There is no stickiness in terms of platform lock-in where there's some special applications
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:24.340]  that web apps that Safari can run that Chrome can't, but you can compete within, you know,
[02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:28.220]  within the realm, even setting aside the arm stuff, setting aside that entirely just with
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:32.300]  the hardware being the same, Safari is better at battery life and that's a place where,
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:33.300]  and it's also fast.
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:37.260]  So Apple does have places to compete on both the hardware and the software front that it
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:38.260]  always has.
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:42.220]  It's just that the M1 shifts that balance of power so far in Apple's direction on the
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:47.140]  hardware side that like what was previously, like what Apple could previously win there
[02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.480]  for the things we just described, like, well, maybe we'll make our OS better and sit battery
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:51.480]  life better.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:54.280]  Maybe we'll have better designed hardware that's sturdier and more attractive.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.280]  Now it's like, okay.
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.660]  And also it's just better in all the other boring ways like speed and, and you know,
[02:01:58.660 --> 02:01:59.660]  power consumption.
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.660]  Yeah, totally.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:01.660]  All right.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:06.020]  Let me take one, a bonus break, a fourth and final sponsor break for our good friends at
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:07.020]  Squarespace.

[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.260]  Get started today.
[02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:26.260]  My thanks to Squarespace.
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:32.740]  One more thing on the stickiness of why I should use a Mac over something else.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:39.140]  And it actually is related to the Mac round table thing and the whole pitch of that meeting
[02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:44.900]  of that quote unquote power users or the high end of the Mac market had been neglected.
[02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:48.100]  And Apple was going to change that by making the big monster power Mac that's next to me
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:53.720]  and just generally paying more attention to what those type of users need.
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.620]  You can get stickiness in the old style, in the old sort of Mac write and Mac paint only
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:05.100]  exist on the Mac by providing stickiness in this case for essentially native applications
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:11.560]  by running applications that can't yet, but maybe not for a long time, run on the web
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:13.500]  or run server side.
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:21.920]  So if you're doing 8K video editing or something that involves a huge amount of 3D processing
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:27.000]  power for like Pixar and their pre-visualization or whatever, that type of stuff, the web and
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.700]  cross-platform stuff in general is not much of a factor and it's really a matter of making
[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:36.260]  monster hardware and then having applications that take advantage of that monster hardware
[02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:38.640]  directly doing exactly what it can do.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:44.020]  So the FPGA card, the afterburner part card for video processing and Final Cut Pro and
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:45.220]  Mac OS.
[02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:50.620]  That is a solution that is not generic and the stickiness of that solution is trying
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:53.060]  to find something that does the same job.
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:56.980]  Final Cut Pro is only on the Mac and if you sort of get embedded in Final Cut Pro and
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:05:01.900]  you get that afterburner card and you get the Mac Pro, that is a very sticky solution
[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:02.900]  to that problem.
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:07.320]  No electron-based web app that is cross-platform is going to be doing that.
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:11.460]  In fact, probably not even a cross-platform video editing app like Premiere because Apple's
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:14.100]  going to be the only one that knows the afterburner card exists and they're going to build and
[02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:18.820]  support Final Cut Pro and Adobe's going to find out about it at WWDC when it's announced.
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:20.900]  And the other version of that is gaming.
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:24.420]  This is in the opposite direction where the Windows has got the stickiness because they've
[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:28.440]  got the monster video cards, they've got the support of all the game makers, they've got
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:32.380]  their own game console that they have been making synergy between the APIs with which
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:35.260]  you write Xbox games and PC games.
[02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:39.320]  And that is an extremely sticky platform, again, with the exception of gaming streaming
[02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:43.580]  services which Apple is fighting with their App Store policies, right?
[02:05:43.580 --> 02:05:47.160]  You can't just say, oh, well, we can run that on the Mac too.
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:51.180]  You don't have any of those APIs, you don't have DirectX, you don't have an Apple game
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:53.620]  console that people are already writing for.
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:56.980]  That's a very sticky solution for the PC and hard to dislodge.
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:03.260]  Those high-end applications that don't run in the power envelope of a phone or a tablet
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:09.040]  and that still use essentially proprietary advantages of each individual hardware and
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:13.700]  software platform, it's super important that Apple did make that turnaround because if
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:17.220]  you're worried about the ultimate stickiness, the old-style stickiness that doesn't just
[02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:21.820]  rely on you making a better power drill for a world that knows it needs power drills,
[02:06:21.820 --> 02:06:24.860]  you need to address those high-end markets because that's the only place that exists.
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:31.120]  No matter how much better your email application and the Finder is compared to the Windows
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:35.280]  shell, that is never going to bring people over to the side or keep them there, right?
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:41.020]  So you just have to sort of compete on the general level of here's a nice elegant tool
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:44.780]  for you to do your normal computing stuff even if the whole time you're also using web
[02:06:44.780 --> 02:06:49.260]  apps, but then also compete on the high-ends where you can.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.900]  Gaming seems like it continues to be a lost cause for Apple.
[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:56.500]  You know, they're trying with Apple Arcade, but on the flip side of that, things like
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:07:03.100]  high-end video editing and 3D that is not gaming 3D are places where Apple could make
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:08.340]  a comeback and continue to be a strong player if they just commit to the direction that
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:14.000]  they've been going in with the new Mac Pro and don't run away screaming after facing
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  some challenges.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.580]  I have no idea how well the Mac Pro is selling, but I fear they'll be like, ah, we tried that
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:20.460]  and people aren't into it, so never mind.
[02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:25.100]  That would be awful, but you know, that's where the real differentiation is on the high-end.
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:31.180]  Yeah, and well, and there's still some traditional things like just like photography.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:36.420]  I don't know anybody who's a serious like either prosumer or outright professional photographer
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:42.380]  who uses web app to do their work, but they do update all upload all their pictures like
[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:45.740]  through whatever app you're using into a cloud storage and everything, right?
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.740]  So Apple's got that.
[02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:51.980]  They've got iCloud and everything, but you know, it's the problems become more tractable.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.740]  The lower the sort of computational and data volume, right?
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:58.020]  So in the beginning, nothing was tractable, and then eventually text-based things were
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:00.660]  tractable and then text-based things with some images.
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:04.740]  And now photography is like, well, not really pro photography because those are big images.
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.140]  You're probably going to store them in the cloud, but you're going to be doing your processing
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:08.140]  locally.
[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.280]  But photography is the next thing to fall.
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:15.260]  Video is a substantial step up from photography in terms of computation and responsiveness.
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:20.500]  And then 3D, same type of deal where you could do these things in the cloud and stream them
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:24.980]  to yourself, but for professional applications, you need the fidelity of local things.
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:29.220]  And so those will surely be the last to fall and the last to move into the cloud, especially
[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:32.860]  given our dismal internet bandwidth and latency in this country.
[02:08:32.860 --> 02:08:35.540]  It'll be a while before they go, but that's how it goes.
[02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:39.700]  Like the internet slowly gobbles things up going from the small wimpy little text things
[02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:44.140]  that will fit over our 2,400-board modems and then just work ends away off the line.
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:48.100]  I think photography, even though you're right, professional photographers are not editing
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:51.500]  their photos in Google Photos.
[02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:55.860]  That's an area that I would be worried about in the next 10 to 20 years, a professional
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:57.500]  web-based photo editor.
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:09:03.460]  I mean, you and I are both old enough to remember when word processing was slow, right?
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:07.300]  Where there would be word processors and say, oh, I don't like this word processor.
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.620]  I can type faster than it can keep up with, right?
[02:09:09.620 --> 02:09:12.980]  You would have the benchmarks where it would say, how long would it take to find all instances
[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:13.980]  of a word in a document?
[02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:17.100]  And they would benchmark it and it would be like 15 seconds.
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.100]  Right.
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:23.740]  That was actually like a standard element of like a Mac world head-to-head review of
[02:09:23.740 --> 02:09:27.620]  this and this is writer versus Mac, right, versus whatever else.
[02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:30.620]  How long does it take to do a word count?
[02:09:30.620 --> 02:09:36.060]  I mean, this is not updated in real time as I type what.
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:40.020]  So yeah, it's, you know, still photos next video someday.
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:44.660]  But video is, of course, racing ahead and we'll all be shooting 8K soon enough.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:51.460]  And then you plus you got VR and AR and Apple's going there as well, right?
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:53.780]  Two things.
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:56.460]  Where the hardware is going and I know you've talked about this.
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:58.980]  You guys talk about it all the time on ATP.
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:09:59.980]  What what?
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:07.820]  I'm curious what you think Apple's the rest of 2021 is going to look like with the rest
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:10.380]  of the Apple Silicon lineup.
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:13.780]  Do you think they're going to get to every other Mac this year?
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:20.460]  I mean, I see no reason why they couldn't get to every other Mac this year.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:23.580]  I forget what the original two year starting point was where they said they're going to
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:25.300]  complete the transition in two years.
[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:26.300]  Yeah.
[02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:28.580]  Isn't this the second year, more or less?
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:30.940]  Yeah, I'm not quite sure how they're counting that.
[02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:36.460]  And I kind of feel like they gave that an under promise so they can over deliver schedule.
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:43.460]  And they definitely under promised and over delivered 15 years ago with the Power PC to
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:45.100]  Intel transition.
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:49.700]  Everybody was a little shocked when they had the Intel Macs ready to go at Macworld in
[02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:53.660]  January, just like seven months after they were announced.
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:58.060]  People were thinking that maybe the first ones would appear at the next WWDC.
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:04.380]  Yeah, so I think the Mac Pro replacement, not this year, right?
[02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.380]  But no one cares about that one.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:08.940]  I'm just saying, setting that one aside, I feel like there's no reason they can't have
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:14.660]  a new iMac and the new high end laptops this year, because that's not that many computers.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:15.980]  They don't have that many Macs.
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:21.420]  They did, you know, their bread and butter laptops that everybody buys that are not too
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:22.420]  expensive, right?
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:27.580]  And they're gonna do the bigger, fancier laptop, and then the iMac, and then the 2022, whatever
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:29.020]  the hell they're doing with the Mac Pro.
[02:11:29.020 --> 02:11:30.060]  That is entirely plausible.
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:34.540]  The thing we talk about at ATP all the time is, but what does that look like?
[02:11:34.540 --> 02:11:38.980]  Does it just look like the current crop of things where externally the computer looks
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:41.140]  the same and internally it has new stuff?
[02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:42.140]  They could do that.
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:45.180]  It would be pretty straightforward, although the iMac is begging for a redesign.
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:48.220]  So we're hoping that one's gonna actually have different outsides.
[02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:52.460]  But then there's the next phase, which is, okay, given that you have quote unquote completed
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:56.460]  the transition and your whole line has these, again, setting aside the Mac Pro.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:57.940]  Your whole line has ARM chips.
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:01.380]  Now when do you make the Macs that you could only make with an ARM chip?
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:05.060]  Because thus far, none of the Macs that they have put out with ARM chips are Macs that
[02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:06.340]  they could only make with an ARM chip.
[02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:09.420]  Maybe the fanless MacBook Air, but externally it looks the same.
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:13.260]  Like it's, you know, it's not, there's nothing about it that's like now the designers have
[02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:17.460]  free reign to do things that they couldn't do before, other than deleting a fan from
[02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:20.540]  basically the same size and shape case, which is fine.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:26.180]  And they did have the one port MacBook, which wasn't called the Air, but didn't have a fan.
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:28.740]  Yeah, but they did that not on ARM, it was just dog sleep.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:29.740]  I know, right.
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.740]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:34.820]  I feel like that's the proof that they still haven't built a Mac they couldn't make with
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:35.820]  that.
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:41.060]  Or, you know, an iMac that is way thinner and is, you know, like the touch screen angle
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:45.140]  of like trying to do something like a Surface Studio, or like there's just, there's, I don't
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:48.340]  know if they're going to do that this year, because we, it's hard to tell.
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:51.700]  The first round of computers were the low end ones, they were straightforward.
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:53.140]  We were blown away by the performance.
[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:57.380]  They're great computers, but also nothing about them other than the performance and
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:58.380]  battery life is shocking.
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:01.440]  It's a MacBook Air, it's got a good keyboard, we love it, it's great.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.000]  But you know, it doesn't break any new ground in terms of the form factor.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.640]  And so I, if trends continue, they will do the transition exactly on that strategy, again
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.060]  with the exception of the iMac and possibly the Mac Pro where the iMac desperately needs
[02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:15.060]  a new case design.
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:17.260]  And the Mac Pro, there's all these rumors of a smaller one.
[02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:23.180]  So throw that in the gears, but I fully expect the 16 inch MacBook with an ARM processor
[02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:28.020]  to look just like the existing 16 inch but be way faster and have better battery life
[02:13:28.020 --> 02:13:31.040]  and make less fan noise and everyone will be like that's a-okay.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.340]  And even if they do the iMac, even if they just take the current 5k iMac and bring out
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:39.300]  one that's like that, but with an ARM processor and do it this year, it'd be kind of disappointing,
[02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.740]  but it'd also be ridiculously fast and not make any fan noise.
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:44.420]  So that's good, right?
[02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:48.140]  And then who knows what they do with the Mac Pro, but it's the next generation of computers,
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:53.620]  the ones where they really do say, let's, let's rethink everything, let's rethink everything
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:58.420]  about our Macs because now we have so much more flexibility to do different things, whether
[02:13:58.420 --> 02:14:03.120]  it's touch screens or styluses or size and weight and just everything about them.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:06.220]  You can make so many different decisions and those are the ones that I'm the most excited
[02:14:06.220 --> 02:14:07.220]  about.
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:09.300]  But I don't really expect those this year.
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:13.860]  I'm hoping against hope that we will see the new completely redesigned iMac this year and
[02:14:13.860 --> 02:14:17.000]  it will be an iMac that would not work with an Intel processor.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.760]  That is plausible, especially if it comes late in the year.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:22.940]  But I'm, you know, I don't want to get my hopes up and be disappointed.
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:29.900]  Again, and I'm not addressing any like German rumors, just my own speculation, but I know
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:35.100]  that the German rumor is that there is an iMac in the works and it's very thin throughout
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:42.180]  as opposed to having like a belly, you know, that tapers to the edges, but actually is
[02:14:42.180 --> 02:14:45.820]  kind of fat right in the middle to hide all the computer guts.
[02:14:45.820 --> 02:14:52.980]  I think it, you know, clearly given the performance of the Mac mini we see with the M1, they could
[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:57.660]  make a Mac that's pretty much literally just the display and the computer part is just
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:02.420]  a super thin thing that doesn't even seem like there is a computer.
[02:15:02.420 --> 02:15:07.500]  There's the GPU question though, because if they don't, if they don't do third party,
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:10.660]  if they do do third party GPUs, all of a sudden your power budget just went way up because
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.700]  third party GPUs are what they are, right?
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:14.700]  And that you need some fan and cooling for that.
[02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:19.500]  If they don't do third party GPUs, then Apple has yet to demonstrate that they can produce
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:25.220]  a GPU on their own that rivals the power of the current top end iMac GPUs.
[02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:33.260]  And that to me is like, that to me is my very biggest question for 2021 Macs is what's the
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:34.260]  GPU story?
[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:37.140]  Because I feel like the CPU story, we've got it, right?
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.460]  They're just going to add more high performance cores.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:46.540]  Like, so the current M1s are eight cores for the high performance cores for the, you know,
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:50.020]  low performance cores, whatever they call them.
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:51.020]  Efficiency cores.
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:53.180]  It's like an efficiency suite at a hotel.
[02:15:53.180 --> 02:15:54.180]  Right.
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.180]  High efficiency cores.
[02:15:55.180 --> 02:16:01.300]  And I feel like the M1X or the M2, whatever they're going to call it, but I suspect maybe
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:03.780]  it'll be the M1X.
[02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:08.500]  I think they'll just add, maybe it'll be 12 cores and they'll have eight high performance
[02:16:08.500 --> 02:16:13.860]  cores and four that, you know, you don't need to really add more of the high efficiency
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:18.280]  cores because they only run when you're doing stuff that isn't taxing.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:23.020]  And then all of a sudden, you know, all the multi-threaded stuff like compiling stuff
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:29.060]  in Xcode and anything in a video app that's multi-threaded that uses the CPU, all of it,
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:32.660]  you know, gets twice as fast because there's twice as many high performance cores.
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:38.900]  It's the GPU story that to me is fascinating in terms of where they're going to go.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:46.860]  Because I feel like, you know, now that they've declared independence from Intel again, it's
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:53.220]  not just being faster than like the current Intel iMac Pro, it's, we know what the high
[02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:54.220]  performance is.
[02:16:54.220 --> 02:17:00.980]  It's the Nvidia, you know, giant, big, hot, flaming gaming PC GPUs.
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:04.260]  And I'm not saying they're going to beat them, but they know where the bar is, right?
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.260]  Yeah.
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:09.420]  I mean, it's a question of whether they're interested in that particular kind of performance.
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:13.060]  Like if you look at the Mac Pro where you can have like two cards, each of which has
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:16.460]  two giant GPUs on it, those GPUs are not gaming GPUs.
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:22.300]  Those are GPUs made for people doing either video or actual 3D, because video uses a GPU
[02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:27.980]  a lot too, or actual 3D stuff that is not oriented towards gaming, it's oriented towards
[02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:30.500]  3D modeling and all that type of stuff.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:36.740]  It's a different type of product to address that market, right?
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:41.060]  And that market is small, way smaller than the gaming market, but the barriers to entry
[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:45.140]  in gaming, like I said before, are much bigger than just, hey, do you have a good GPU?
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:49.380]  Because Apple doesn't have DirectX, Apple doesn't have Xbox, they don't have any of
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:50.380]  those APIs.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:53.580]  Apple wants to push Metal, and that's great for all the iOS games, and it's great for
[02:17:53.580 --> 02:17:58.380]  those iOS games to be ported to the Mac, but that's not where the high end of PC gaming
[02:17:58.380 --> 02:17:59.380]  is, right?
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:02.660]  That's where the high end of mobile gaming is, and Apple's well positioned there, but
[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:03.660]  it's a very different market.
[02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:06.380]  And honestly, mobile gaming is bigger than PC gaming, so a lot of this is just kind of
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.380]  like Bragmarites.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:12.860]  But in terms of stickiness, yeah, mobile games can run pretty much everywhere, because mobile
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:18.700]  GPU power is small, but on the high end of gaming, those games can't run on your phone,
[02:18:18.700 --> 02:18:19.700]  for the most part.
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:20.820]  Fortnite accepted, right?
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:25.300]  But there is a high end of gaming.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:32.480]  And so for the GPU stuff, so far Apple has not shown any interest in trying to match
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:34.740]  Nvidia for high end gaming cards.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:37.860]  They don't offer anything like that on their Mac Pro today.
[02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:41.980]  The most expensive GPUs you can get on your Mac Pro are way more expensive than anything
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:47.060]  from Nvidia and have way more teraflops, but are not way better for games, because that's
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.060]  not what they're made for.
[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:49.060]  And that's not what you buy them for.
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:55.140]  And who would spend this much money, you know, it's like 10 times as much money you'd spend
[02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:58.300]  on the gaming PC, and you'd have worse performance on a Mac Pro.
[02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:01.340]  So Apple doesn't seem interested in that market at all.
[02:19:01.340 --> 02:19:06.580]  And so I do wonder, you know, for the Mac Pro next year, or whenever it comes out, they
[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:11.740]  do have to at least match what they're doing now, which is, oh, so I can get four GPUs
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:14.740]  that use like 200 watts of power each.
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:19.580]  And that are tailored to professional 3d and video applications.
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:21.440]  What is the Apple equivalent of that?
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:25.980]  Or does Apple just ship, continue to ship the best AMD offers, because that's also a
[02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:27.460]  perfectly viable alternative.
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:29.280]  We just don't know what the story is.
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:32.980]  Because thus far, the only Macs that they've released with the ARM processors are ones
[02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:36.020]  where they can get away with using the embedded GPU.
[02:19:36.020 --> 02:19:37.020]  And it's great.
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:40.300]  And honestly, I think they can get away with using the embedded GPU on the 16 inch as well.
[02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.860]  They'll just scale it all up.
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:45.460]  It's when you get to the iMac and the Mac Pro, where there's a big question mark, right
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:50.740]  where it's more than just driving a second Pro Display XDR, right?
[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:56.300]  I mean, because what are the things that you use the GPU for in a high end multi thousand
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.300]  dollar Mac setup?
[02:19:57.300 --> 02:20:04.500]  I mean, at a basic level, one of them is you might want to have multiple 5k or 6k displays,
[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:09.980]  and you want to honestly, that's like, that's so below the, the limitations that I get even
[02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:14.900]  the even the wimpiest, like was it the $999 computer runs this Pro Display XDR.
[02:20:14.900 --> 02:20:18.260]  So that's, that's fine, running, running the monitor used to be a big thing.
[02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:19.260]  And we're kind of in that mindset.
[02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:24.020]  But these days, the GPUs are all good enough now that they all run big monitors enough
[02:20:24.020 --> 02:20:25.940]  to cover your entire field of view.
[02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:30.620]  And no matter, you know, if money's no object, you can put as many XDRs in front of you as
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:31.820]  practical to use.
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:37.220]  And we can assume Apple can make GPUs to drive them as well as you want them driven.
[02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:41.780]  I mean, the real limitation there is the bandwidth of the wire connecting display to the things
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:45.620]  because it's not the GPU power to crunch those pixels or even to composite them.
[02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:51.220]  It's getting the data out of the computer into and that's not a limitation that is uniquely
[02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:52.220]  Apple.
[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:54.900]  Everyone's using the same interfaces to talk to their monitors, right?
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:56.260]  Gaming is another one.
[02:20:56.260 --> 02:21:01.740]  And that's just like a whole universe unto itself where, you know, the Mac just isn't
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:03.020]  a major player.
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:09.820]  And, you know, I've got inklings that Apple is there are people at Apple who are at least
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:15.780]  sniffing at the question and asking, well, wait, why aren't why isn't the Mac part of
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:16.780]  gaming?
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:17.780]  What?
[02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:18.780]  I mean, VR is a big angle.
[02:21:18.780 --> 02:21:19.780]  Right.
[02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:20.780]  We know Apple super into that.
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:21.780]  Right.
[02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:27.340]  And VR thus far has not set the gaming world on fire, but it is a gaming adjacent technology.
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:32.240]  And so if you get really good at VR, you're also kind of really good at VR games.
[02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:36.100]  Like it's it becomes a it's so much more an API question, right?
[02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:40.580]  Because the current crop of AMD GPUs, despite the fact that Apple is just still on the outs
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:43.840]  with Nvidia and the Nvidia does have the best gaming cards.
[02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:49.620]  The current crop of AMD video cards do give the Nvidia cards a run for their money, right?
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:52.960]  It's not it's not like they're just so far behind that nobody cares, right?
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:56.140]  Still, the 3090 is probably the king in most games.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:22:01.100]  But if you see the benchmarks of the latest AMD cards, sometimes they beat the Nvidia
[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:02.660]  ones, sometimes they fall behind.
[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:07.120]  Overall, it's a it's a, you know, a narrow win by Nvidia, maybe.
[02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:12.080]  But but they're in the ballpark, which right, and so that is available to Apple to do.
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.080]  The problem is great.
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:14.080]  So you've got a great GPU.
[02:22:14.080 --> 02:22:17.620]  Well, you better reboot into Windows because you can't play into the games because they're
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:21.180]  all based on DirectX, which is the thing that Mac doesn't have.
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:26.540]  So you know, maybe VR is one of the answers where they if they come out with a compelling
[02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:33.620]  VR platform that, you know, clarifies the market in the way that the iPhone clarified
[02:22:33.620 --> 02:22:39.740]  the modern smartphone market, and they can expect games to be written for it as opposed
[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:45.200]  to well, we've got these games that, you know, are targeting all this Windows, Xbox stuff.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.620]  We can't really just, it's not worth it for us to move it over there.
[02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:51.860]  You kind of need to write it from scratch for the thing.
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.340]  Maybe they've got something like that in mind.
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:55.340]  I don't know.
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:58.380]  And I don't I don't think they should be expecting that to happen.
[02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:02.380]  Because VR gaming has been a thing on the PC for a long time now.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:07.140]  And unless Apple is doing something very different, there's probably no combination of hardware
[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:10.380]  and software that Apple can release that will have a substantially different impact on the
[02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:14.820]  VR gaming market than all the existing PC based VR gaming products.
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:15.820]  Right?
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.460]  Because it's, you know, it is what it is, right?
[02:23:17.460 --> 02:23:21.900]  If you have a different idea, say it's either not games, or it works in an entirely different
[02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:22.900]  way, that's fine.
[02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:29.060]  You can really come out with the Apple version of an HTC Vive or whatever, or an Oculus,
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.060]  right?
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:31.060]  We have that already.
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.060]  It's on the PC.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:36.580]  And the chances of Apple beating those platforms in price performance, let alone getting into
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:39.780]  game support and what you're actually run out of that are very slim.
[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:43.660]  So we don't know what Apple's play is there with the VR AR thing.
[02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:44.660]  Maybe it's not gaming.
[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:50.600]  If it is gaming, they can be an also ran, they can be a maybe a sibling and eventually
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:56.460]  a competitor, but actually competing in the gaming market requires a long term will that
[02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:59.180]  Apple has yet to demonstrate in that market.
[02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:04.260]  Yeah, I you know, so let's call it its own universe and say it's a maybe and I think
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:05.460]  they've got their eye on it.
[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:11.220]  But I mean, you know, you'd lose a lot of money if you ever bet on Mac gaming becoming
[02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:12.220]  a big thing.
[02:24:12.220 --> 02:24:15.880]  But AR and VR can be used for playing old applications too, right?
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:16.880]  Not just gaming.
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:22.020]  Oh, and the other thing though, that Apple has shown and this was a very big part of
[02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:27.700]  the I don't mean to be dismissive, but the dog and pony show they had when the iMac Pro
[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:31.960]  debuted and they had a I maybe they did something on the west coast too.
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:37.360]  But in the east coast, it was you know, media was invited up to their secret mansion in
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:38.900]  New York.
[02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:44.380]  And they had like, it was like felt like being in school where you'd go on a field trip and
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:46.100]  you'd go from station to station.
[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:49.700]  But there was, you know, the developer station and the developer station was somebody you
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:55.060]  know, somebody from Apple product marketing and had a thing when they were running a bunch
[02:24:55.060 --> 02:25:01.140]  of VMs running, you know, other like Linux and doing server side stuff and doing all
[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:04.540]  this stuff in parallel and showing you all this fit, you know, this is how great this
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:09.100]  machine is for developers and come here behind the machine and feel you know, how that it's
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.460]  not running hot, there's no fan.
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.580]  And then you'd move to the next station and it was this and it was that but one of the
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:20.220]  big storylines of this was the parallel processing with GPUs, which they were doing at the time
[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:27.060]  with the iMac Pro with the the external GPUs, the GPUs, which they've kind of since backed
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:28.060]  away from.
[02:25:28.060 --> 02:25:32.280]  I mean, it's only been a handful of years, but it's already seems like, yeah, we're not
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:33.280]  really going to do that.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:38.340]  But they, they made a big deal of saying that for a lot of pros, like 3d, it was like 3d
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:42.580]  rendering, I forget which app it was, but they were showing how much faster it was when
[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:47.440]  you plugged in this eGPU with a bunch of stuff that ran in parallel and all of a sudden,
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:52.620]  you know, 3d artists can do these things that used to be like, well, render it, wait, and
[02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.480]  then see and then it's like, instead, no, you can do it in real time and tweak it as
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:57.480]  you go.
[02:25:57.480 --> 02:26:01.140]  And, you know, anybody, you don't have to be a 3d artist to know that something that
[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:07.400]  you used to have to wait, see what it looked like, then tweak, then wait again, it's way
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:13.860]  better to be able to model it live and tweak it and, you know, play with it in your hands.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:18.140]  But that's, you know, eGPU stuff with the most, you know, that's talking about doing
[02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:23.640]  it at the very highest level, nothing they've shown on their GPU front would say that Apple
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:25.420]  has the chops to do it.
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:29.880]  But I kind of think that that's where what that's what they're going to show in 2021
[02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:30.880]  that they
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.840]  Well, part of what Apple I think was showing in that demo is the thing they've demonstrated
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:40.960]  a lot is that for things like whatever that 3d program was with Maya or whatever, that
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:49.240]  Apple has Apple has Apple's OS Mac OS has capabilities in it that allow programs if
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:55.920]  written to these API's to flexibly take advantage of all the GPU value of power that's available
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:56.920]  to them.
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:27:01.520]  So part of plugging in the eGPU is to say, and also we're still using both the discrete
[02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:05.480]  and the integrated GPU that are inside this laptop and also the eGPU.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:09.600]  So it's not like we're saying, okay, we plug in the eGPU now the eGPU does all the work.
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:15.740]  The clever API's to make that possible, provided the application vendors write to them is an
[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:17.680]  advantage of the Mac platform.
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:24.080]  And it's in a realm, 3d apps or whatever, where the Mac does have some tiny semblance
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:28.080]  of a foothold or maybe a fingernail hold, right, because they've just been pushed out
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:31.080]  of almost all those markets, but they're trying to come back to them.
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.840]  And so unlike games where you have the games is more like TV streaming, where it's a creative
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:40.960]  business and you need you need creative content and hits things like audio, video editing
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:46.460]  and 3d, you just really need to have one or two or three good big players there.
[02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:51.240]  You need to have Photoshop for photo editing, you probably need to have some kind of thing
[02:27:51.240 --> 02:27:53.920]  for video, Apple's got Final Cut, right?
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:55.800]  You need to make sure Premiere is still on your platform.
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:58.920]  You don't need it's not like gaming where it's like every year you need to wear the
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:01.980]  kits, where are the blockbusters, where are the great games, right?
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:10.040]  And so it is easier for Apple to claw back some semblance of market share in that market
[02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:14.240]  with its assets of, you know, hey, we have an OS that's flexible enough to use GPU power
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:16.360]  wherever it's available, right?
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:20.680]  But in all those instances, like you said, when they plug in the GPU, it's made by AMD,
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:21.680]  right?
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:25.760]  And Apple's insistence on not moving and using anything from Nvidia seems is more and more
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:26.760]  puzzling.
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:31.000]  And I see the tell all book about that, because I know if it was Jobs's, you know, vendetta,
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  that makes perfect sense.
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.280]  But he's been dead for years, and they still don't want to go near them.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:38.020]  And then the other story about that Nvidia sold them parts that failed and Nvidia wouldn't
[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:39.600]  take responsibility for it.
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:43.040]  And that's the type of thing that could give like Tim Cook a lifelong grudge where it's
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:46.540]  like we're never working with you again, because your crap didn't work and you didn't make
[02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:47.540]  it right for us.
[02:28:47.540 --> 02:28:48.540]  Right.
[02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:49.540]  So that can make some sense.
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:52.600]  But either way, like it's, it's an uncomfortable situation.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:57.580]  Like Apple, like the ARM based Macs don't have AMD GPUs in them.
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:02.440]  It's Apple's GPUs, Apple bought GPU companies and integrated them into their chip team,
[02:29:02.440 --> 02:29:03.440]  right?
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:07.260]  And so in this sort of in this dark period now where we don't know what's going to happen
[02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:11.120]  with the rest of the ARM based Macs, everything that's happened so far fits with what we see
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.060]  low end uses chips that look a lot like the iPad chips, but have a little bit more stuff
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:19.680]  in them integrated GPU, that all makes perfect sense, no surprises.
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:22.880]  There is the one path that we could take from this point on, which is guess what?
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:25.380]  There will only ever be Apple GPUs and systems from now on.
[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:29.760]  You didn't know this, but Apple's been working on an AMD caliber discrete GPU for years and
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:30.760]  here it is.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:31.760]  Right.
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  Yeah.
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:33.760]  That's and that's what I think they're going to do.
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:38.960]  And then to tie it in with German rumors, and I guess this one isn't from German.
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:44.800]  I think it's from the information, but this story about the headset costing $3,000 and
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:49.040]  having an 8K display in both eyes.
[02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.960]  If that's true, that's a hell of a GPU.
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:56.460]  Well, they're using foveated rendering where they only render the part at full resolution
[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:57.640]  where your eyeballs are looking.
[02:29:57.640 --> 02:29:59.580]  So you get a lot of cheating out of that.
[02:29:59.580 --> 02:30:05.160]  But still, for something that's light enough and cool enough to be on your head, I mean,
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:10.000]  well, I mean, the rumor pictures of this show it looking a lot like an Oculus as in terms
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  of that size.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.620]  Like, remember we were talking about the Apple glasses for years and years.
[02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:16.660]  And now as we get closer and closer to a real product, it's like, well, it's basically an
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:17.660]  Oculus.
[02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:20.400]  It's got a TV mask that you put on your head, it's got screens in it.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:24.660]  The GPU thing, I continue to have trouble believing that Apple is going to appear out
[02:30:24.660 --> 02:30:28.760]  of nowhere with an AMD or Nvidia caliber high-end GPU.
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:32.720]  I continue to think that the most obvious and easiest path for Apple in the next few
[02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:37.160]  years is to ship AMD GPUs in their computers just like they are now, because they're really
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:39.520]  good and somebody already makes them.
[02:30:39.520 --> 02:30:43.320]  And Apple has never made anything like that.
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:48.600]  And I would think that if Apple had internally a GPU team able to make anything that can
[02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:52.260]  compete with those two players, we would have heard about it for years from them hiring
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:55.560]  all of the best GPU designers in the world to make those things.
[02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:59.200]  Now, arguably, maybe they already have them because they came with PowerVR or Imagination
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:00.640]  or whoever the hell they bought.
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:01.640]  So I don't know.
[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:04.280]  It's hard to tell with Apple hardware, with the internal secrecy stuff.
[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:07.240]  Like we didn't know about the 64-bit phone CPU until it came out.
[02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:10.080]  So they're really good at keeping secrets.
[02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:15.720]  But if I had to put money at it, I would say they'll just use AMD GPUs because they're
[02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:18.640]  really good and they already exist and they can get them to work.
[02:31:18.640 --> 02:31:20.480]  But the headset, you're right, is the big question mark.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:26.120]  I don't see them using an AMD GPU in the headset just because of the portability issues.
[02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:30.920]  And AMD is not as focused on this specific application as Apple will be.
[02:31:30.920 --> 02:31:38.680]  So maybe the headset has an Apple GPU, but the iMac and the Mac Pro have AMD GPUs.
[02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:43.720]  I'm 60-40 on the side, 60 on the side that Apple's going to do their own.
[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:50.040]  And 64-bit mobile CPU is a good example of, whoa, this came out of nowhere and it wasn't
[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:56.040]  even rumored that that's what sort of a GPU story they're going to drop this year.
[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.040]  But 60-40.
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:00.360]  Well, I mean, we're using the George Costanza rules.
[02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:02.760]  That means that I'm right, right?
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:03.760]  Maybe.
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:07.360]  And when it comes to betting, just do it with the opposite of what our group is doing and
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:08.360]  you'll win.
[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:12.320]  Well, I'm better on betting on this Apple stuff than I am betting on football.
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:17.800]  You could have made a lot of money this year if somebody who faded me on every single bet.
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:18.800]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:19.800]  Exactly.
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:22.040]  I don't know anything about anything that you're betting on, but it does seem like you
[02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:23.040]  lose a lot.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:26.240]  And you could have bought a car betting against me on the Super Bowl.
[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:30.840]  Just whenever you buy GameStop, just do the opposite.
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:32.920]  I even lost money on GameStop.
[02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:33.920]  I know.
[02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:34.920]  Like an idiot.
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:36.400]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:37.880]  It's actually a viable strategy.
[02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:39.200]  It was like double at one point.
[02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:40.840]  I was like, well, wait, it was a 480.
[02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:42.840]  I was like, oh, I'll sell it at 500.
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:43.840]  There we go.
[02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:44.840]  You got greedy.
[02:32:44.840 --> 02:32:45.840]  Yeah, I got greedy.
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:46.840]  But that was my bet.
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:47.840]  It was always a...
[02:32:47.840 --> 02:32:48.840]  It was fun money.
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:49.840]  That's fun money.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:50.840]  Get rich or nothing.
[02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:53.120]  You don't tend to win at Las Vegas either, but it's fun.
[02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:54.120]  No.
[02:32:54.120 --> 02:33:01.200]  Last but not least, just to wrap it up, what do you think of the current state of Mac OS
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.200]  as a whole?
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:05.480]  Are you happy or are you not happy?
[02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:10.480]  I mean, I think as technology marches on, our standards increase, right?
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:12.880]  None of us are...
[02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:17.760]  The honeymoon period of a single application not bringing down the Mac is long since over,
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:18.760]  right?
[02:33:18.760 --> 02:33:21.000]  There's certain things we just accept as the way things work, right?
[02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.360]  And our standards get higher.
[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:27.200]  So not only do we not want applications to not crash our computer, but if one application
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:31.240]  misbehaves, we don't want it to make other parts of the system unresponsive.
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:32.800]  We don't want things to have bugs.
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:35.760]  Like the applications themselves have been getting more complicated with all sort of
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:38.460]  network syncing for everything and just...
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:39.460]  We want everything.
[02:33:39.460 --> 02:33:40.960]  We want it to just be...
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:43.440]  Our demands increase as things get better.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:50.980]  So the state of the Mac operating system as compared to what it was like 10, 20 years
[02:33:50.980 --> 02:33:55.080]  ago is fantastic, but also the expectations have changed.
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:01.440]  So coming from a current day perspective and not comparing it to operating systems a decade
[02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:09.800]  ago, I think that the Mac needs fairly desperately several refinement passes.
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:14.560]  Because the main thing that I find frustrating about the Mac these days is not related to
[02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:20.240]  any feature it doesn't have or even the annoyances of the UI.
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:23.980]  It's like, make a laundry list of the features that exist in macOS.
[02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:27.420]  And so many of them I can say, well, I've written that feature off because it just doesn't
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:30.560]  work enough of the time for me to bother with it, right?
[02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:32.200]  And that shouldn't be the case.
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:35.640]  There shouldn't be whole spots of the OS that I just don't even look into anymore.
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:39.920]  Because even though ostensibly this feature does this thing, practically speaking it does
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:43.600]  it so badly that you will get too frustrated by trying to use it for that purpose, so just
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:44.920]  use something else.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:48.520]  Whether it's something as simple as iCloud Drive, which I swore off based on the early
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:52.480]  experiences and which supposedly is better now, but basically I moved on and used things
[02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:56.980]  like Dropbox or, you know, Expand Drive or whatever instead, all the way to things like
[02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:02.140]  Spotlight that have been around forever, but that have weird reliability issues or are
[02:35:02.140 --> 02:35:05.320]  inscrutable or are not tractable, right?
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:10.780]  Or even, like, I was thinking about this the other day, the philosophy that Apple has endorsed
[02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:16.600]  on the Mac for so many years related to everything that syncs with anything was that, oh, it
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:19.040]  just magically works behind the scenes and don't worry about it.
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:22.720]  But then when it doesn't work, you have no recourse, and it's incredibly frustrating.
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.980]  There are tons of the parts of the system that are like that.
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:25.980]  And I was shocked.
[02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:31.520]  I was like, last year, this year, last year, whenever the first version of Messages on
[02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:35.720]  the Mac came out that had a sync button in Preferences, do you know what I'm talking
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:36.720]  about?
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:37.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:38.720]  That blew my mind.
[02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:41.760]  I was like, yes, do you know how everyone else does this?
[02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.960]  There should always be a way to force a sync right now.
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:50.840]  There should always be a way to reset or refresh or get out the crux because so many parts
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.280]  of Mac OS are supposed to be silently doing something behind the scenes but then get hung
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:59.240]  up and don't work and are impossible to debug and it makes people just forget about that
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:02.400]  feature and say, well, I'm just not going to use that because I can't rely on it.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.040]  Even if it's something as simple as like when a reminder comes up and it comes up on my
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:09.740]  phone and it comes up on my Mac, look at Apple with the amazing ecosystem of all their products
[02:36:09.740 --> 02:36:10.740]  working together.
[02:36:10.740 --> 02:36:16.360]  And then on my Mac, I do a thing that I like to say on my phone, I dismiss it.
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:22.160]  When I dismiss it on my phone, I want to see it go away on my Mac sometime, some reasonable
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:23.160]  amount of time later.
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:26.600]  It doesn't have to be the millisecond or the second, but when I dismiss it on my phone,
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:29.360]  it just sits there on my Mac, I'm like, Mac, what are you doing?
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:31.780]  I dismissed that on my phone five minutes ago.
[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:35.280]  That type of thing makes me think, should I be using reminders or should I use a third
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:37.600]  party app?
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:43.200]  Almost every feature that's part of the Mac operating system should be much more reliable
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:46.920]  and much more like debuggable when it does have problems.
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:47.920]  Just every single one.
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:51.040]  There's almost nothing in the system that you can say that works reliable all the time
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:54.120]  and it's performant and I can't imagine any problem with it, right?
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:58.680]  And it just seems like we never get the chance that those teams never get the chance to refine
[02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:02.920]  existing features to the level of polish that they should.
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.280]  Whereas on iOS, it seems like more of them do.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.280]  Not that iOS is perfect, but it seems like more things are polished to an appropriate
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:14.080]  level of shine on iOS than they are on the Mac.
[02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:15.080]  That's what I want from the Mac now.
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:17.760]  I want someone to polish this sucker.
[02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.360]  No new features.
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:22.920]  Protron said it, we need to have like two years of no new features.
[02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:27.960]  Two years just to fix the crap that's in the operating system already and make it all work
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:28.960]  all the time.
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:32.120]  And for the things where you know there's some weird scenario where it might not work,
[02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:36.700]  but there's a bunch of corrupted data hiding somewhere, give me a button to force the sync.
[02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:38.920]  Give me a button to reset or redo.
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:41.760]  Give me the equivalent of SCK for whatever these data structures are.
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.360]  I want to like give me the tools to understand what's going wrong and to make it happen when
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:51.720]  people, what was it, Cable Sasser of Panic was saying his wife, her photo libraries has
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:55.280]  been like having this progress bar for like a year that just never completes, right?
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.360]  I've got that on my iPhone.
[02:37:57.360 --> 02:38:01.840]  It's like just what it makes you want to not use Apple's photos.
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:03.640]  Photos is supposed to do a thing.
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:06.880]  Make it do the thing, the Steve Jobs thing, you know, what is what is.Mac supposed to
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:09.960]  be and why the F isn't doing that, right?
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:12.680]  Almost everything in the Mac needs that level of polish.
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.920]  And it seems like Apple completes the features, ships them, refines them over the course of
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:19.200]  that OS release, and then never revisits them.
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.360]  And so much crap is just like dying on the vine from neglect on the Mac.
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.480]  That's what I want on the Mac.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:25.480]  That's what it needs.
[02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:28.040]  Because honestly, getting back to what we're talking about, like, why do you like the Makita
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:31.900]  power tool over the, you know, Craftsman power tool or whatever?
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.020]  They're both drills.
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:34.720]  They both drill holes.
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:36.140]  Why would you prefer one over the other?
[02:38:36.140 --> 02:38:37.280]  That's the whole point of the Mac.
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:40.960]  It's got to do whatever it's doing better than the alternatives.
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:43.760]  And that's how Apple's built an app to have to compete with third parties app.
[02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:46.880]  And that's how Apple's entire operating system needs to compete with Windows.
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:49.280]  They all do similar jobs.
[02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:53.280]  But you should the Apple should be make the one that we prefer because it does the job
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.400]  better.
[02:38:55.400 --> 02:39:00.400]  I would like to see them not they don't have to acknowledge it because this isn't that
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:02.560]  sort of thing you can brag about on stage.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:08.360]  Although remember, I mean, the no new features this year for 10.6 it got one of the most
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:10.280]  raucous applause is.
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:14.440]  I mean, of course, yes, it's the WWDC crowd, not a consumer crowd.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:21.680]  But it was, you know, it got a wonderful response.
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:29.360]  And everybody remembers 10.6 as maybe the best and most stable release of not just that
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:32.040]  OS, but any OS any company ever made.
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:34.160]  Well, 10.6.0 was super shaky.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:38.600]  And it did stuff like introducing Grand Central Dispatch and 10.6 and all this crap like that.
[02:39:38.600 --> 02:39:41.900]  But what people remember is by the end of 10.6 it was solid.
[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:42.900]  So like 10.68.
[02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:43.900]  Right.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:44.900]  Yeah.
[02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:47.980]  The consumers weren't at WWDC and didn't care.
[02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:49.640]  But everybody wants this.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.880]  The consumer is basically it's only downside when you screw it up, they get angry.
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:56.240]  But developers love it because developers they see it as an upside.
[02:39:56.240 --> 02:39:57.680]  That would still be an applause line.
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:01.360]  If they do that today and say, guess what, in Mac OS we're having a refinement year,
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.360]  that would be such a huge, huge applause line at WWDC.
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.960]  And honestly, regular rank and file Mac users are not looking at Mac OS and saying, boy,
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:11.340]  I wish it had this feature or that.
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:15.040]  All they care about is why the hell isn't mail search working when I switch users.
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:16.040]  That's what people care about.
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:17.040]  Just make it work.
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:19.880]  So speaking of that in particular, so I have a couple I don't have a bunch, but I have
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:23.800]  a couple of smart mailboxes in mail on my Mac.
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:27.000]  And again, it's one of it's one of my favorite features on the Mac, because you still can't
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.880]  make smart mailboxes on iOS.
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:32.740]  But I have one that it's just called seven days.
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:35.160]  And it's just all my email from the last seven days.
[02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:39.200]  And it's my weird way of dealing with the fact that I have tens of thousands of unread
[02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:42.140]  emails in my inboxes.
[02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:48.920]  But if my seven days smart mailbox is zero unread, that's my version of inbox zero.
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.280]  You need to have a whole other podcast about how you deal with email.
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:53.280]  Right.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:54.280]  I do.
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:58.060]  I need psychoanalysis for the way I deal with email.
[02:40:58.060 --> 02:41:06.760]  But a week or two ago on the M1 MacBook Pro, it was like I switched to the smart mailbox.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:10.160]  And it wasn't even like switching the messages that were listed.
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.200]  It was just bizarre.
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:15.400]  And then I figured that it was like all busted.
[02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.400]  And then I was like, what the hell is going on?
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:21.200]  And then I figured out Spotlight was just busted system wide.
[02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:23.920]  Like any Spotlight search just returned nothing.
[02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:25.760]  And I thought, oh, boy, this is trouble.
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:31.000]  Maybe now it's been a while since I've dug into the MD util command line stuff and how
[02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  do you nuke?
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:33.600]  And I was like, well, let me just try restarting.
[02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:35.860]  And I restarted and then everything just worked.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:36.860]  And it didn't.
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:41.120]  I was expecting that I'd look in activity monitor and there'd be, you know, some kind
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.200]  of Spotlight thing running that was reindexing everything.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.200]  Nope.
[02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:50.280]  It just something crashed silently with no error message and everything seemingly looked
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.280]  all right.
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.240]  But I just it's the sort of thing a normal person would never think to do.
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:41:59.880]  You're not supposed to have to restart your Mac normally, right?
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:04.560]  Most people should only really restart when they run, you know, like a system update that
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:07.400]  needs to restart.
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.960]  It you know, that's I don't know why.
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:13.820]  I mean, that's the type of thing that shakes people's faith in a particular feature.
[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:17.440]  Like if you say you're using Apple Mail as your mail thing and it starts behaving like
[02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:22.400]  that, even if you solve your problem by rebooting, that's going to make you think, do I want
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.800]  to keep using mail for this?
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:24.800]  Right.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:25.800]  It has one job.
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:26.800]  Just show me messages and stuff.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:29.880]  And when I click on them, you know, when I click on things in the sidebar, change the
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.560]  detail view, like it's not a complicated application from a user perspective.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:36.640]  And when basic stuff like that doesn't work, it makes people think maybe I should just
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:37.640]  use Gmail.
[02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:42.240]  And honestly, I've been using the web interface of Gmail forever because it because of the
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:47.760]  boring attributes it has of being the same everywhere and always, always, always working.
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:52.680]  And that's been, you know, I loved, you know, Entourage and what was the one before that?
[02:42:52.680 --> 02:42:53.680]  Claris emailer.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.680]  Right.
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:56.320]  And like those were my favorite native applications.
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:00.120]  I never got on board of the Apple Mail train because by then Gmail was in effect and I
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:04.960]  couldn't get over the advantage of having the same email rules everywhere and a consistent
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:07.380]  view of my email from every single platform.
[02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:12.280]  And there's no way Apple Mail would get me back onto it with all the horror stories I
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:13.280]  hear about it.
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:15.320]  Like basic things not working.
[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:18.200]  I can't understand how people do anything in mail in that way.
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:22.760]  And I, I use Apple Mail as a backup of my local backup of my Gmail, I pop from Gmail
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  down to Apple Mail.
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.040]  So I do launch it from time to time, but I don't use it as my application.
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.040]  Right.
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:31.440]  And so just how do you bring back Apple Mail?
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:33.800]  And you know, you don't bring it back by saying, oh, we're going to have all sorts of neat
[02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:38.920]  features that are like, uh, you know, like, Hey.com or like all those other inbox that
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:42.320]  the Gmail bought, like all those cool features of how to manage email.
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:43.320]  No.
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:47.620]  Step one, make it a reliable application that works for its intended purpose.
[02:43:47.620 --> 02:43:52.120]  Step two, after you've done that and it can handle everybody's giant mailbox reliably
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:57.560]  100% of the time without crashing or losing email or being wonky, then you can start thinking
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:02.780]  about, oh, here are some cool features for, you know, managing my email in a better way.
[02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:08.040]  But honestly, Apple Mail it's changed so much over the years in terms of weird interface
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:13.080]  tweaks, but it has never substantially improved on the basic premise of like, does it work
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.080]  all the time?
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.480]  Like to compare it, what I always compare it to, uh, is an application that has always
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:20.280]  looked similar net newswire.
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:23.520]  Can you remember clicking on the sidebar net newswire and not having to do something in
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:24.520]  the right thing?
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.760]  Like a net newswire is a complicated application that syncs with a million feeds and everything
[02:44:27.760 --> 02:44:28.760]  like that.
[02:44:28.760 --> 02:44:33.200]  But UI wise, it has always been a very similar sibling to Apple Mail, but has always been
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:35.800]  so much more reliable than Apple Mail.
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:40.560]  And I can tell you that the development team for net newswire is substantially smaller
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:43.080]  and less well-funded than the development team for Apple Mail.
[02:44:43.080 --> 02:44:44.400]  So it makes no sense.
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.280]  I will say I have cause for, I I'm, I'm overall optimistic though.
[02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:50.240]  I would like to see the same thing.
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:53.960]  And the reason here's where I was going with my, but they can't say this on stage, but
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:45:00.960]  I think that they should just acknowledge it is desktop operating systems are 30 years
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:01.960]  old, right?
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:04.120]  The Mac came out in 1984.
[02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:10.200]  It turns out that the basic idea of doing things in windows that you can resize around
[02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:15.360]  your screen and a menu bar at the top, it, it, it has permanent staying power.
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:21.120]  There's no, there's no need for innovation like radical innovation.
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:22.120]  It's it's done.
[02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:23.120]  It's a set thing.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:29.800]  It's a way that like somebody from 1984 could get, well, you'd have some problems in a car
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:30.800]  today.
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:31.800]  Like,
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:34.680]  I mean, I wouldn't say that it's done, but I would say that it is a form.
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:40.240]  It is an acknowledged form and there is value in a high quality implementation of that form.
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:44.120]  It doesn't mean it's the be all end all form and it is even the best form, but it is a
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:45.120]  form.
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:49.600]  And so your goal should be give me the best version of that form.
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:51.240]  You can also be working on other forms.
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:53.040]  Arguably there are with the iPad and the VR.
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:54.120]  That's fine.
[02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:59.640]  But for the Mac, don't worry so much about, uh, trying to add another geegaw to the Mac
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:02.500]  because fundamentally, unless you're going to change it fundamentally and it doesn't
[02:46:02.500 --> 02:46:06.440]  seem like you are anytime soon, just make the best version of macOS that you can make
[02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:11.000]  without worrying about, and honestly, I think that Apple hasn't been worrying about radically
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.200]  changing the Mac.
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:15.840]  They've mostly just been fiddling around at the API layer with iOS compatibility and they
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:20.080]  had a couple of diversions in the lion error of trying to make it more iOS like some of
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.000]  which worked and some of which didn't.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:28.400]  But at this point, I think what you're trying to get at is like, don't either either wow
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:32.400]  me with your amazing innovation, but if you're not going to do that, don't try to impress
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:33.400]  me.
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:34.400]  Just make an awesome macOS.
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:35.400]  Right.
[02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:36.400]  It's, you know, it's an Italian restaurant.
[02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:38.560]  Just make some good Italian dishes, you know?
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:39.560]  Right.
[02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.600]  It's not to say that there can't be better restaurants or fusion restaurants or new cuisines
[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:47.160]  or whatever, but if you're not going to, if you are continuing to be an Italian restaurant,
[02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:51.960]  just make good Italian food and don't try to like put, you know, don't have one dish
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:57.480]  where you do Italian fusion with Mexican, like it's not going to make anybody happy.
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:46:58.680]  Is that you're going to be your whole restaurant?
[02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:01.640]  Then fine, they make a whole Italian Mexican restaurant, but that's not what we're here
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:02.640]  for.
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:03.640]  We're here for the Italian restaurant.
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:04.640]  It's the thing that we know that we like.
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:05.640]  Just make that.
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:06.640]  Right.
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:10.040]  Just come out with a nice Italian bread and a plate of olive oil to get me started and
[02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:11.040]  we'll go from there.
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:15.200]  But, you know, you don't have to reinvent that part.
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.480]  My biggest cause for optimism going forward is the rewrite of messages in Big Sur, which
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:23.400]  was rewritten in Catalyst.
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:28.040]  I still have some issues with messages, but I would say that the new version of messages
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:33.600]  is as good or better than the old version in just about every way.
[02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:40.160]  And they even included the sync button for the iMessage account.
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.720]  I do wonder how that sync button came to be.
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:44.200]  Well, I'll say this about the sync button.
[02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:46.080]  I love that it exists.
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:49.280]  What I don't love is that occasionally on, you know, because I have every one of them
[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:52.020]  Macs in the house, the entire family has accounts on it.
[02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:57.600]  So I'm very familiar with all of us sort of logging into a Mac that's not like the Mac
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.360]  we use every day.
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:03.400]  And the promises of messages in the cloud is, well, whatever Mac you go on when you
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.160]  launch messages, there will be all your message.
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:09.320]  Like, that's my understanding of the promise of iMessage in the cloud or whatever the hell
[02:48:09.320 --> 02:48:10.320]  they call it now.
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:11.320]  Right.
[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:14.680]  And they've got the sync button that if you log onto a Mac and launch messages and it's
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.340]  doing the thing and maybe there's a progress bar and you're like, often I log on, I want
[02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:22.540]  to see the last message from my wife, but the scroll back doesn't show it.
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:26.760]  And if there's a little progress bar and it's going like, well, eventually that message
[02:48:26.760 --> 02:48:27.760]  will appear.
[02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:31.400]  So right away, I'm saying, OK, Apple, one thing you can improve is it's really important
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:33.640]  for the most recent messages to be there first.
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:35.360]  Don't worry about filling in the last year of conversations.
[02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:37.360]  I've just showed me the most recent one.
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:39.000]  Second, why is it taking so long?
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.360]  So I'm worried about that.
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.640]  Then the progress bar ends and I still don't see the messages I want.
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:44.980]  So then I'm glad there's a sync button.
[02:48:44.980 --> 02:48:47.960]  So I go into preferences and I press sync.
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:49.880]  I like that there's a sync button.
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:53.920]  I would like it better if pressing the sync button solved my problem, like, oh, I see
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:55.740]  that it is trying to sync now.
[02:48:55.740 --> 02:48:59.920]  And then I'm looking at my watch and going, hmm, well, I still I still won't see the last
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:00.920]  message.
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:01.920]  I still don't see it.
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:04.400]  And I walk away and I come back and I still don't see it.
[02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.460]  I still don't see it.
[02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:07.320]  So there's still a long way to go.
[02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:10.960]  But it is fascinating to me that a sync button even exists.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.120]  How did that button get there?
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:14.680]  Why is that button there?
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.160]  Who made a successful argument for that button to be there?
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:19.160]  And why?
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:20.160]  Why is it necessary?
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:21.160]  And why?
[02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:23.020]  When I click it, does it not solve my problem all the time?
[02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:28.800]  And what was it as big a fight as I think it might have been behind the scenes?
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:32.560]  Or did it escape the did it completely noticed?
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.920]  And now so somebody is going to listen to this podcast and say there's a button and
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:37.920]  then delete the button.
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:38.920]  I mean, don't be wrong.
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:41.080]  I would rather have it than not have it.
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.160]  But I also want it to do the job.
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.400]  Like if the regular sort of you don't have to do anything, syncing fails or takes too
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:49.400]  long.
[02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:52.280]  The sync button should be the okay, now do it for realsie reals.
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:55.480]  And that had better work because once that fails, I'm back to the not knowing what to
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:56.480]  do.
[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:58.760]  Why can't I see the last message from my wife on this computer?
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.020]  I don't know.
[02:50:00.020 --> 02:50:06.360]  That's like my nightmare doing what I do is if there's secretly like one engineer on the
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:11.920]  messages team who got that in to solve some really very real problems and he listens to
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:16.880]  the show or he or she listens to the show and they're like, Oh my God, shut up.
[02:50:16.880 --> 02:50:19.560]  Don't mention the sync button.
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:22.520]  There's all sorts of stuff like that in Mac OS, I'm sure.
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:27.960]  But unlike the chess app or terminal, I think there's an actual team of people on messages
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:31.640]  and they've given it a lot of attention to give it feature parity and having it be catalyst
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:32.920]  based and all that stuff.
[02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:36.840]  But what we're talking about here is one of Apple's Achilles heels, which is the sort
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:42.320]  of network services sync aspect of messages, even on iOS devices going from one device
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:43.320]  to the next.
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:45.040]  I don't always see the same messages everywhere.
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:50.560]  I find that endlessly frustrating because the baseline sort of the table stakes as evidenced
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:55.640]  by things like Gmail is no matter what device I go on, when I go to Gmail, whether it's
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:51:00.680]  in a web browser or in a native app, I see the same list of messages always 100% of the
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:01.680]  time, all the time.
[02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:02.680]  It never fails.
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:07.440]  I never spend three days going, why doesn't this device show the same messages as this
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:08.440]  one?
[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:11.600]  Now there's lag, a couple of seconds or whatever, and there's a refresh button.
[02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:13.360]  The refresh button works though.
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:17.220]  I've never hit the refresh button and not had an instantly refresh list to be the same
[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:19.120]  as the up-to-date one from another device.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:24.320]  That's table stakes and Apple is failing at that with iMessage and I find that depressing.
[02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:25.320]  Overall though, what do you think?
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:26.640]  Thumbs up, thumbs down?
[02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:31.520]  I mean, it's the best of all the other desktop operating systems.
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:34.800]  I certainly wouldn't want to use Chrome OS or Windows, but I always want things to be
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:35.800]  better.
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:40.560]  It's in better shape than I would have worried in 2021.
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:48.400]  I mean, honestly, the whole sort of Mac philosophy and hardware turnaround is like in some ways
[02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:51.800]  we're taking the OS for the granted and there are things that are problems in it, but in
[02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:54.960]  general they haven't really super screwed up the OS.
[02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:56.720]  They really super screwed up the hardware for a while.
[02:51:56.720 --> 02:51:59.020]  So I'm excited to see that turning around.
[02:51:59.020 --> 02:52:02.680]  That's why I'm saying you just need to get your feet under you on the software side because
[02:52:02.680 --> 02:52:05.480]  the hardware side, you're going on a good path there.
[02:52:05.480 --> 02:52:06.480]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:11.400]  Well, we're at the three hour mark, so I'm going to call it a show.
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:13.920]  I appreciate so much you coming on the show.
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:14.920]  This is good.
[02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:21.520]  I feel like I got a lot off my chest, stuff that's been building up.
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:22.520]  What do you want to promote?
[02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:24.960]  You're on, what, about 18 different podcasts.
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:26.960]  ATP, everybody surely knows about.
[02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:28.660]  That's over at ATP.fm.
[02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:29.660]  What else?
[02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:30.660]  What else have you got?
[02:52:30.660 --> 02:52:31.660]  Yeah.
[02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:32.660]  Reconcilable differences over on relay.fm.
[02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:36.320]  It's a podcast I do with Merlin Mann, where we talk about our feelings.
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:41.320]  I got Robot or Not, which is a very silly podcast with episodes that are even shorter
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:42.320]  than dithering episodes.
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:47.580]  A couple of them are two minutes long, some are five, some are 10 minutes long.
[02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:49.800]  That's a very silly show, but it's fun.
[02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:52.660]  Check that out at theincomparable.com.
[02:52:52.660 --> 02:52:53.660]  And then I don't know, what else?
[02:52:53.660 --> 02:52:56.600]  I got a website that I never update, not too many other exciting things.
[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:59.760]  I feel like next time you have me on, you always have me on to talk about the max stuff,
[02:52:59.760 --> 02:53:00.760]  which makes sense.
[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:05.860]  But at this point now, I feel like the next time you have me on, it should be 100% a coaching
[02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:10.480]  session where I talk to you about things you argue with Ben about on dithering and give
[02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:11.760]  you better talking points.
[02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:13.600]  Ah, I need that.
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:14.600]  I need that.
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:18.320]  Well, it seems like you need that because very often you disagree, but then he argues
[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:20.180]  you into a corner and you demur.
[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:23.480]  And I feel like the worst thing that could happen is that eventually he brings you over
[02:53:23.480 --> 02:53:24.480]  to his side and everything.
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:25.760]  You both just agree about everything.
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:29.040]  So before that happens, we're just going to come on a show and you can just, you just
[02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:32.540]  bring up dithering topics and you'd be like, whatever this thing was Facebook.
[02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:36.720]  And then, you know, you'll tell me what Ben said and then what you said, and I'll tell
[02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:39.640]  you how to, anyway, that's, we should do that next time.
[02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:40.640]  I can use that.
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.640]  I'm open to that.
[02:53:41.640 --> 02:53:43.640]  John, thank you very much.
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:57.280]  Thanks to all of our sponsors and I'll talk to you soon.
