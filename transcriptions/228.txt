[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  How are you?
[00:02.520 --> 00:09.840]  Pretty good. I'm just failing to fight the temptation to ask you a follow-up question about mechanical keyboards right now
[00:10.640 --> 00:13.160]  Do it. We'll lose the whole show. Did you?
[00:14.480 --> 00:22.160]  Did you try a keyboard that like some modern mechanical keyboard as a potential replacement for your Apple extended? No, not yet
[00:23.120 --> 00:27.040]  I'll sort of I should take that back. I got
[00:27.040 --> 00:32.440]  I am nowhere near as in deep with you. Actually. I should take this all back. I have to I have tried several
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.200]  I shouldn't say
[00:34.200 --> 00:37.960]  This is we're seriously gonna lose the whole show here. Yeah, I have a DOS keyboard
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.240]  That that's spelled das like yeah
[00:42.440 --> 00:46.380]  3.3 keyboard that would be something else das is in like das boot the
[00:47.280 --> 00:49.280]  fantastic submarine movie
[00:49.280 --> 00:50.760]  I
[00:50.760 --> 00:57.480]  Bought several years ago and I forget what kind of switches that one has but
[00:57.960 --> 01:05.060]  I have since given that one to my son Jonas and he loves it and it is apparently a pretty decent gaming keyboard. I
[01:06.120 --> 01:08.120]  Never really liked it. It was too clicky
[01:08.400 --> 01:13.080]  Yeah, and then based on some recent back and forth with you
[01:13.680 --> 01:16.000]  based on your I
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.560]  Don't know if you consider it portable you can say but it's your iPad as a writing setup. You have right sure the Matthias
[01:24.760 --> 01:25.800]  portable
[01:25.800 --> 01:29.000]  Something something. Yeah, it's like a Bluetooth. They have a Bluetooth
[01:29.800 --> 01:32.040]  keyboard that's got their key switches
[01:32.040 --> 01:37.880]  Which are not the same and and people give me such grief for it because it does feel very old Apple design school
[01:37.880 --> 01:43.780]  It's a big kind of puffy silver plastic keyboard, but it's very hard to find a good
[01:43.780 --> 01:45.780]  Bluetooth
[01:45.940 --> 01:52.200]  Mechanical keyboard. They're just USB. It is puffy puffy is a good way to describe it. All right, I'm gonna put this in the
[01:55.180 --> 02:00.300]  It's just a big thing of plastic like right now now it would be kind of a metal kind of fringed thing
[02:00.300 --> 02:03.380]  But instead it's just like a big piece of plastic
[02:04.220 --> 02:06.620]  With a keyboard in it and I don't use that
[02:06.620 --> 02:06.940]  well
[02:06.940 --> 02:09.700]  it doesn't even make sense for me to use it with any of my
[02:09.700 --> 02:17.140]  Mac's because when I'm not gonna use a separate keyboard with a MacBook and I've got my beloved extended Apple extended
[02:17.260 --> 02:19.860]  keyboard to on my iMac, which it's I
[02:20.700 --> 02:22.980]  Mean, I guess in theory I could someday find a keyboard
[02:22.980 --> 02:25.180]  I like better than an Apple extended keyboard too
[02:25.180 --> 02:30.100]  But until I do I won't but I just feel like you need to be doing some groundwork now for that day
[02:30.100 --> 02:34.540]  We're where the last Apple extended keyboard falls apart, right?
[02:34.980 --> 02:38.500]  You can just plug in something new and be like, alright, I can just keep on writing
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.500]  Well, I've mentioned before that
[02:40.900 --> 02:42.900]  There's a decent chance
[02:43.100 --> 02:45.980]  That it depends when I replace my iMac
[02:46.740 --> 02:49.340]  I mean because the thing is with the iMac
[02:49.700 --> 02:54.060]  It'll probably be one of the last computers that Apple ships that still has the old style
[02:54.140 --> 02:57.420]  USB a port in the back because there's plenty of room
[02:57.940 --> 02:59.940]  right, but surely
[03:00.540 --> 03:02.540]  Within a handful of years
[03:02.900 --> 03:04.900]  It'll be USB C
[03:04.940 --> 03:06.340]  everywhere
[03:06.340 --> 03:12.700]  Adapt adapt to your adapter and you just keep on going. I I've got I have I have at one point I adapted
[03:13.940 --> 03:15.940]  mini firewire
[03:16.100 --> 03:20.820]  400 the the i-link sony stuff to proper firewire 400 to firewire
[03:21.100 --> 03:25.380]  800 to thunderbolt 2 to thunderbolt 3
[03:25.580 --> 03:29.020]  Wow, that's actually worked it actually worked
[03:29.020 --> 03:31.860]  So, you know, there's no end to the number of adapters
[03:31.860 --> 03:35.180]  You can just stack on top of that extended keyboard to keep it going, you know
[03:35.180 --> 03:40.020]  But you know someday if I want to use my extended keyboard to on a USB C only machine
[03:40.020 --> 03:45.980]  I'll have to go from ADB to my ADB to USB a
[03:47.540 --> 03:51.260]  The I made Griffin I made adapter right of which I have
[03:52.100 --> 03:57.980]  Yeah, I was gonna say that may die before your keyboard does I have two mint condition backups, but my original which I bought in
[03:57.980 --> 04:04.940]  In cheese probably like 1998 or something. I would think yeah, you know and it's well maybe 99
[04:04.940 --> 04:08.940]  But it's you know, it's if anybody has never seen a Griffin. I'm I believe they were all the same
[04:09.820 --> 04:13.620]  Color they were the iMac style Bondi blue
[04:14.540 --> 04:18.460]  Translucent plastic, you know as everything was after 1998
[04:19.780 --> 04:24.080]  But I'm still on my first one. It is a very durable little adapter
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.180]  But eventually I'll have to plug that into a USB to USB C
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.520]  Adapter which you know is nowhere near the chain that you just said you put together for data and this is only for typing
[04:34.520 --> 04:41.120]  But anyway, I have the Mattias that you have I do like it. It is certainly the favorite hardware keyboard
[04:41.120 --> 04:43.120]  I've ever used with an iPad
[04:43.120 --> 04:53.120]  And I wish I knew which stand I have I have a stand that I don't know that I've ever seen anybody recommend but it's from
[04:54.880 --> 04:58.260]  Cheese I could go upstairs and get it but I have to interrupt the show and I don't want to do it
[04:58.260 --> 05:01.320]  But it's you know, I'll just put it in the show notes, but I think it's from
[05:02.400 --> 05:09.200]  Belkin and it just is a little foldy thing and it doesn't raise the iPad at all because I don't really I'm fine with
[05:09.200 --> 05:14.320]  because I only pretty much use it on like a kitchen counter and it's already sort of like I'm sitting on like a
[05:14.960 --> 05:21.100]  You know a not quite barstool height, but you know more than a floor seat, you know, like a kitchen counter seat
[05:22.000 --> 05:27.820]  So I don't mind that the iPad isn't raised off the thing and it folds and it has several it's not like you can
[05:28.560 --> 05:32.400]  Bend it to any angle. It has like a bunch of incremental steps
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.820]  But there's enough of them that it's always there's always a good one and it's an excellent excellent little stand
[05:37.820 --> 05:39.980]  because when you fold it all the way up it
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.820]  it's very small and
[05:43.760 --> 05:50.260]  When it's open, it's very sturdy because it clicks and so it's in addition to being a good stand for popping up an iPad for
[05:50.260 --> 05:54.660]  Typing it is an outstanding. It is the best stand I've ever used in
[05:55.220 --> 06:00.660]  What close to 10 years 10 years for iPad for watch using it as like a little TV. I guess that's cool. I
[06:01.640 --> 06:04.540]  Swear to god, I'll put it in the show notes, but it's a nice little stand
[06:04.540 --> 06:11.020]  I like the Matthias, but I don't love it. It's mushy. It bothers me. It's always bothered me
[06:11.020 --> 06:17.500]  How many little glyphs Matthias puts on the key caps like they did I guess some people would like it
[06:17.500 --> 06:22.020]  But like they'll put little things up in the right corner to show you that option
[06:22.780 --> 06:23.820]  left
[06:23.820 --> 06:25.300]  gives you
[06:25.300 --> 06:31.000]  Exactly a curly quote and that option shift bracket gives you a double curly quote and vice versa
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.280]  Yeah, it's overkill. I get that some people really get off on the idea that like literally every character
[06:37.280 --> 06:42.440]  You can make with that keyboard is labeled on the keys, but that seems like overkill to me, too
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.720]  No, I I am right there with you
[06:44.720 --> 06:48.080]  I have yet to find a perfect solution to any of this
[06:48.080 --> 06:53.200]  But I'm always on the lookout because I do like I do like not
[06:53.680 --> 06:58.520]  always being at my desk and being able to go to the bar in my kitchen and take an iPad and just
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.720]  Sit there and write a little bit
[07:00.720 --> 07:04.760]  It's a great change of pace. And so I like that and having a good keyboard for that
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.560]  I've gone through all sorts of different kinds and I've the Matthias is the one that's stuck so far
[07:09.560 --> 07:14.340]  But it's definitely not perfect and I would love to get something else. I could attach some of my
[07:14.920 --> 07:17.480]  Good mechanical keyboards of which I have too many
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.640]  With USB, but the problem there is that like the command and option are flipped because a lot of them are
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.960]  Windows keyboards and some of them have like dip switches that let you flip them the other way and some of them aren't and it's
[07:28.960 --> 07:30.960]  Yeah, it's too much. So
[07:31.600 --> 07:34.640]  Maybe there'll be a new iPad Pro that'll solve all of these things by
[07:35.440 --> 07:37.280]  Something I don't know what on the Mac
[07:37.280 --> 07:42.520]  It's not a problem using those keyboards, right because you can use the system preference thing to change exactly
[07:42.520 --> 07:45.920]  And iOS doesn't doesn't do that. At least not yet, you know and
[07:46.800 --> 07:53.260]  My second last episode Marco Arment was on and we were talking about keyboards and Marco has this tip
[07:55.200 --> 07:56.800]  For
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.120]  Using that you go to the keyboard system preferences thing. It's not you know, third-party stuff at all
[08:02.120 --> 08:06.000]  It's all supported by the system and you can switch a bunch of modifiers
[08:06.000 --> 08:07.960]  It's helpful if you have a third-party keyboard
[08:07.960 --> 08:14.800]  But with even with the standard keyboard you can switch caps lock to you to be escape or control some people love
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.960]  there's like a bunch of Unix people who there's all sorts of Unix commands that use the control and on on an
[08:21.160 --> 08:24.540]  Apple keyboard controls this little fiddly thing to to the left of
[08:24.540 --> 08:29.900]  Of Z if caps lock is, you know, one of the easiest keys on the whole keyboard to hit so, you know
[08:29.900 --> 08:36.560]  Either way, but using caps lock for escape is pretty interesting as you know, and we'll get into this later
[08:36.560 --> 08:40.780]  I guess talking about MacBook Pros, but with you know without the escape key on MacBook Pros
[08:41.380 --> 08:43.700]  Yeah, exactly right. No, that's a that's a smart thing
[08:43.700 --> 08:47.020]  I'm so happy that Apple did that there was for the longest time you always had to download weird
[08:47.020 --> 08:54.800]  Software in order to do some like slight keyboard modifications. Yeah, and now you just don't I mean there are so many different things
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.360]  That that are just built into the keyboard a little keyboard system preference. It's great
[08:59.680 --> 09:03.080]  There was in years past there was some truly sketchy
[09:05.400 --> 09:06.680]  Level
[09:06.680 --> 09:12.420]  unsupported and they in addition even when you found one that was like rock-solid and it never did never didn't seem to cause any
[09:12.420 --> 09:16.820]  Problems you'd upgrade to the new version of Mac OS X and it would just do nothing
[09:16.820 --> 09:19.700]  It would just be like ah, and it's like you go to the right
[09:19.700 --> 09:23.860]  What's where's the web page and you go to the web page and it hasn't been updated in six years and it's like ah
[09:24.420 --> 09:26.860]  Well, and there's the overkill factor too that I always felt
[09:26.860 --> 09:32.420]  It's like I literally need to flip two keys on my keyboard and I've got this whole piece of software that usually did like
[09:33.180 --> 09:34.940]  9,000 other things and it's like no no
[09:34.940 --> 09:38.580]  No, I just I do this with keyboard maestro now for some things where it's like yeah
[09:38.580 --> 09:43.860]  At least I use keyboard maestro occasionally for actual automation of stuff and it's really great for that
[09:43.860 --> 09:46.100]  It doesn't apps don't have to be scriptable
[09:46.100 --> 09:51.020]  It's amazing the stuff that you can get it to do but I always feel a little bit bad saying I really just want to
[09:51.020 --> 09:57.700]  Map key a to be key B and vice versa. It's like what a waste but you got to do it, right?
[09:57.700 --> 09:59.700]  You got to get the keys to be what I want them to be
[10:00.220 --> 10:04.700]  I've been talking more about keyboard maestro lately and I've been using it more lately. I
[10:04.700 --> 10:08.740]  I just did a thing. Here's an example. I really I meaning to
[10:09.420 --> 10:12.980]  Once like the news stuff psychs comes down this fall
[10:12.980 --> 10:15.740]  Like I'm queuing up a bunch of ideas for keyboard maestro stuff
[10:15.740 --> 10:23.020]  but the the idea and and it goes with my sort of recurring theme of here's why I love the Mac and
[10:23.540 --> 10:30.920]  Can't really imagine switching to iOS full-time. Not that there's anything wrong with iOS, but you could never do this on iOS file
[10:30.920 --> 10:32.920]  You know, that's the tag category
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.920]  Yeah for these articles
[10:36.160 --> 10:43.440]  For for reasons that aren't worth going into I use an app called Mars edit to edit during fireball
[10:43.440 --> 10:49.440]  It's a great blog editor from red sweater software friend of the show Daniel jalkin. I've been using it for years
[10:50.280 --> 10:52.280]  Don't know quite what I would do without it
[10:52.880 --> 10:54.880]  really don't
[10:55.360 --> 10:57.360]  And
[10:57.360 --> 11:04.040]  The way I have movable type setup it writes every file every time I write a posted during fireball
[11:04.280 --> 11:11.680]  movable type generates two static files one of them with a dot text extension the plain text version of the file one with a
[11:11.680 --> 11:14.560]  dot PHP, so if I write an article called
[11:17.920 --> 11:19.920]  The talk show
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.920]  Episode 229 there'll be a file in the file system with the date and I'll say the talk show 229 dot t
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.820]  Ext and one with the same little slug dot PHP
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.880]  But then I have everything set so that the public URL that everybody sees doesn't have any file extension at all
[11:37.480 --> 11:43.040]  Right, and I have a patchy setup my web server on the server setup with the thing called multi views
[11:43.080 --> 11:46.560]  So there is no actual file in the file system that matches
[11:46.560 --> 11:53.600]  The URL and what multi views does is just make the best guess possible and it defaults to the PHP version
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.000]  Which is what you want, which is what I want and you see a little web page and so you get the right version
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.240]  there's no file extensions visible to the user and
[12:03.960 --> 12:09.560]  Even if you go to the dot PHP version I have also have a patchy set to redirect you to the one without the PHP
[12:09.680 --> 12:10.440]  version
[12:10.440 --> 12:17.360]  Right, and then you can go to the dot text version and see my raw markdown source for any article just by adding dot
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.480]  Txt to any article on during fireball nice little like an easter egg
[12:24.040 --> 12:27.640]  Now for reasons that aren't worth explaining in in Mars edit
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.160]  there's a it's sort of like a mail app and I can go to any article and I can control click on it and I can
[12:33.160 --> 12:35.160]  copy the published URL and
[12:35.160 --> 12:42.600]  And in most blogging systems, or if I had movable types set up so that my public URLs had those dot PHP extensions
[12:42.600 --> 12:47.320]  This would all be fine. But what Mars edit copies has dot PHP at the end and
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.520]  So, you know a couple times a week
[12:50.520 --> 12:55.380]  I want to copy I want to get the URL for a recent article for daring fireball and the easiest way for me to do
[12:55.380 --> 13:00.340]  It at least in my mind is to go to Mars edit not go to daring fireball and page down looking for it
[13:00.340 --> 13:04.380]  Because it might be you know, three four or five days ago, but in Mars edit
[13:04.380 --> 13:08.080]  It's just one, you know, I can go three four or five days down just by looking with my eyeballs
[13:08.400 --> 13:15.060]  so I control click I copy and I either paste it into another article or I paste it into a tweet or whatever and then
[13:15.060 --> 13:20.300]  You know for 15 years, I've been pasting and then delete delete delete delete
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.880]  Sure
[13:22.880 --> 13:29.040]  And after 15 years of being annoyed by that every single time because I want to delete that dot PHP
[13:29.040 --> 13:36.200]  Extension, even though I know that I have it set up so that if you go to that URL, it'll automatically redirect you
[13:36.200 --> 13:42.080]  I just it bothers me on aesthetic grounds. It's the anal retentive side of John Gruber
[13:42.900 --> 13:45.840]  After 15 years of being annoyed by this. I finally thought you know what?
[13:45.840 --> 13:48.640]  There's got to be a way I could fix this in keyboard maestro
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.440]  And of course it took me like I don't know two minutes to solve it
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.960]  I just have a global shortcut that looks for command V
[13:56.960 --> 13:58.960]  in every app and
[14:00.760 --> 14:07.840]  Before it actually pastes keyboard maestro looks at the clipboard sees if it sees if it matches the the regular expression
[14:08.480 --> 14:10.160]  starting with
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.240]  HTTP as staring fireball
[14:12.800 --> 14:14.800]  ending with dot PHP and
[14:15.040 --> 14:21.320]  If it matches strip the PHP from the clipboard and then no matter what whether it matched or didn't match
[14:21.320 --> 14:27.800]  Actually paste whatever was on the clipboard and I've there's the old fuddy-duddy in me who thought well, wait a minute
[14:27.800 --> 14:29.040]  You don't want to slow down
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.040]  Pasting system-wide just so that once or twice a week
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.960]  You don't have to manually delete it. And of course, it's instantaneous on a modern computer takes, you know
[14:36.960 --> 14:42.480]  It obviously is technically slower, but it's slower by like a thousandth of a second imperceptible
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.160]  And I'm so happy so proud of myself
[14:46.840 --> 14:47.560]  That's great
[14:47.560 --> 14:52.560]  I was thinking is there a utility out there that just watches your clipboard and acts on it in different ways
[14:52.560 --> 14:54.160]  But you're right. You could just do it at paste
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.520]  Well, that was my first chain
[14:55.520 --> 14:59.800]  You could chain a whole bunch of different things like oh if the active app is this then do this other thing right based on
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.480]  The contents or whatever. Yeah, right
[15:01.480 --> 15:06.320]  There's also I'm sure of other people have way more complicated things out there that modify their clipboard
[15:06.320 --> 15:13.440]  but anyway keyboard maestro is one of the most essential utilities to my life that I can ever imagine and
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.640]  And you know, I have other ones that are more important. This is like a minor annoyance
[15:17.640 --> 15:23.280]  But to me eliminating those minor annoyances is a big deal. What's the brand the other brand of mechanical keyboard?
[15:23.280 --> 15:26.120]  I do you have a couple I a couple of years ago
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.800]  I was talking about one and I almost bought one of their keyboards and it was the big problem was they had too many
[15:32.040 --> 15:37.800]  Too many options it paralyzed me, but even on this show I talked about it. They have like a little
[15:37.800 --> 15:45.880]  So the WASD keyboards, yeah, that's it. Yeah, and they've got their own keyboards and they've got the code keyboards as well
[15:45.880 --> 15:51.680]  and then they've got the different sizes and then you can choose which kinds of labels you've got and what colors your keys are and
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.380]  What the key switches are because they use cherry key switches and and yeah, I I have one of those
[15:57.720 --> 16:02.240]  And it's it's really nice. Although I don't usually use it because they it's too big
[16:02.240 --> 16:08.280]  I really have gotten into these super compact keyboards there is I want my trackpad as close to my keyboard as possible
[16:08.280 --> 16:13.620]  And that means like the smaller so the opposite of the extended keyboard. I wanted to like the least width possible
[16:14.400 --> 16:16.720]  But but WASD has some really nice keyboards
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.440]  But there are a lot of them and it's a tyranny of choice because it's like oh
[16:19.440 --> 16:23.960]  I want the blue switches the brown switches the red switches and do I want the the ANSI layout or do I want the do?
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.160]  I want the ten keyless or do I want to have the number pad and well, you know
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.280]  Do I want the black keys or the or the white keys and it just goes on and on?
[16:31.280 --> 16:36.560]  Here's how bad my memory is getting Jason and possibly yours as well
[16:36.560 --> 16:42.940]  I just did a search on daring fireball for WASD keyboards. Uh-huh instantly came up. It was
[16:43.580 --> 16:47.660]  The talk show episode 198 with special guest Jason Snell
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.960]  I just want to point out to listeners of the talk show that I could have mentioned baseball and I didn't oh god
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.640]  I just mentioned bit. Let's not talk about that. That's the kid. That's a show killer. Yeah, I don't think so
[16:59.640 --> 17:04.440]  I think we got to stay away from that. Yeah, it's too too. We did a nice bit about keyboard maestro there
[17:04.440 --> 17:07.640]  I was gonna even throw in the thing that blew me away about keyboard maestro
[17:07.640 --> 17:14.640]  Is that it literally because it'll drive the UI you can put you can like take a screenshot of like a part of the interface
[17:14.640 --> 17:16.640]  and say
[17:16.760 --> 17:21.700]  Find this and then click and you can say like and then click 20 pixels to the right
[17:22.600 --> 17:25.920]  And like with that you could literally it will drive anything
[17:25.920 --> 17:31.340]  It'll do keyboard commands. It'll click on things and you can you can get it to automate
[17:31.920 --> 17:39.120]  Anything you can ever imagine in Mac OS which is amazing and I have used that because I have some apps that are completely unscriptable
[17:39.120 --> 17:44.440]  I had no idea had that look at the screenshot and click on this. It's amazing like
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.360]  It's radio buttons that have some text on them in an app that I don't use anymore
[17:49.360 --> 17:55.080]  But I use for a very long time which was nice cast from rogue amoeba and it wasn't scriptable and had a drawer
[17:55.080 --> 17:58.480]  That's how old the UI was at a drawer with a radio button in it
[17:58.480 --> 18:00.800]  and I took a little screenshot of the radio button and
[18:01.060 --> 18:07.400]  the text next to it and said find this and then click the radio button and it totally worked but
[18:07.880 --> 18:11.680]  Yeah, I mean, it's sort of sad that it came to that but it did it. It's amazing
[18:11.680 --> 18:13.320]  This is really rather uncanny though
[18:13.320 --> 18:18.520]  This episode with you was literally to 25th of August last year and as we record
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.400]  It's the 23rd and this show will probably come out. It was a Friday though
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.540]  So I it was Friday the 25th of August when it was published
[18:25.540 --> 18:31.180]  This show will almost certainly be published on Friday the 24th of August and I'm gonna have the new minnows Oreos episode
[18:31.220 --> 18:37.500]  Yeah, my favorite side result of that episode a year ago was I linked not just to WASD keyboards
[18:37.500 --> 18:42.880]  But was he has a thing called the keyboard tester and it's just it's not an electronic device. It's just a little
[18:43.740 --> 18:49.640]  Little thing strips six key little strip six keys wide with one of the each of the six
[18:49.640 --> 18:56.360]  Cherry key switches they offer and it's in addition a nice way to sort of get a basic idea of
[18:56.520 --> 19:01.600]  What the different key switches are although some of them are so subtly different it is. Yeah
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.320]  But it also makes for one of my favorite desk toys of all time
[19:07.760 --> 19:12.400]  It is one of the greatest desk toys of all time. I've I've had it on my desk ever since and
[19:12.400 --> 19:18.320]  The funny side effect of that is I got an email from like the CEO of WASD keyboards
[19:18.320 --> 19:22.080]  Like like a week or two later and he was like I had no idea what was going on
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.080]  We sold out of the keyboard testers
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.880]  We sell like we sell like three a week and all of a sudden we sold out of all of them in a day
[19:29.880 --> 19:35.040]  And I I thought we were hacked and then I've somebody figured out that it was your podcast
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.000]  You know and he was very nice and he was like, you know, that's fantastic
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.920]  You know, so thank you so much for linking to it. Would you like me to send you a keyboard?
[19:42.920 --> 19:47.600]  What would you like like so he offered me a free keyboard and I wrote back and thanked him for that
[19:47.600 --> 19:53.040]  I said, let me think about it, but I never wrote back because I couldn't decide. Yeah
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.680]  Yeah, there are a lot a lot of decisions
[19:55.680 --> 20:01.400]  they ordering the keys and the the fact that they can do custom like any kind of key labeling you want on it too so
[20:01.400 --> 20:03.640]  they can like make one that looks like the
[20:03.640 --> 20:09.240]  Your extended keyboard or they've got ones that are super modern. They've you know that that goes into it, too
[20:09.240 --> 20:11.240]  But yeah, they're very nice people
[20:11.440 --> 20:16.560]  And that you can order custom keys from them and stuff and the tester is great. I've it that also has solved my problem
[20:16.560 --> 20:19.380]  I did figure out which key switches I preferred and that was great
[20:26.080 --> 20:30.420]  So I'm looking at you're gonna love this because I know that it's something that you wanted to follow up about
[20:30.420 --> 20:34.660]  From the Marco episode. I'm looking at my pictures from the antenna gate press conference
[20:36.780 --> 20:40.180]  And you have never seen three more unhappy people
[20:40.980 --> 20:46.420]  Then Steve Jobs Tim Cook and Bob Mansfield in these pictures. They are just miserable
[20:47.540 --> 20:50.300]  Nobody wants to be there. It's amazing
[20:50.820 --> 20:55.380]  Well, the follow-up aspect of it is that on the show with Marco we were talking about that. I forget how it came up
[20:55.380 --> 21:02.460]  But the fact that I it was the fact that I asked the question of whether you know that there was it seemed to me
[21:02.460 --> 21:07.660]  like the way that questions were going in the Q&A period that people were starting to take the tack of
[21:08.180 --> 21:10.180]  Apple is saying the solution to this
[21:11.820 --> 21:17.700]  That's just Jason's photo just popped into my note and they definitely do not look happy
[21:18.900 --> 21:23.760]  The I could see the narrative forming in the questions that people were starting to say
[21:23.760 --> 21:29.700]  Okay, Apple says the answer to antenna gate is that they're gonna give everybody a free bumper and everybody should use it to avoid
[21:29.700 --> 21:34.580]  The problem and I asked the question whether of any of the people on stage, you know, you guys having problems
[21:34.580 --> 21:36.500]  Do you need a bumper or you know?
[21:36.500 --> 21:38.060]  I forget exactly how I phrased it and
[21:38.060 --> 21:43.540]  instead of saying anything all three of them just took their iPhone fours out of their pocket and held them up and showed that they
[21:43.540 --> 21:47.300]  Were bumper free and it it it lightened the mood in the room
[21:47.300 --> 21:54.780]  But anyway the miss I misremembered I thought it might have been I knew Mansfield was there. I thought it might have been Jobs
[21:55.540 --> 21:57.240]  Mansfield and Phil Schiller on stage
[21:57.240 --> 22:04.300]  But it was not it was from left to right Tim Cook Steve Jobs and Big Bob Mansfield from left to right who were on stage
[22:04.540 --> 22:10.960]  For the Q&A after that, so that's a correction from two episodes ago. Good good. Good memories. Good night
[22:10.960 --> 22:13.420]  I was happy to look up my pictures of that
[22:13.420 --> 22:19.660]  Yeah, cuz yeah, nobody Steve Jobs. I think came back from a Hawaii Hawaiian family vacation. Yes that press conference
[22:19.660 --> 22:26.300]  He did not want to be there. No, he did not but it was it was a master stroke in a PR management
[22:26.300 --> 22:28.300]  it was it was very
[22:28.700 --> 22:31.860]  as arrogant as Apple can be I think they I think they
[22:32.700 --> 22:39.180]  Accurately assessed that the narrative that the iPhone 4 had a crippling antenna problem was spinning out of control
[22:39.180 --> 22:41.180]  And they needed to nip it in the bud
[22:41.180 --> 22:43.180]  Yep
[22:43.460 --> 22:48.340]  The other correction from the same episode is we were talking about that trick of what do you do?
[22:48.340 --> 22:50.340]  If you really miss the hardware escape key
[22:50.860 --> 22:57.240]  And I said something to the effect of maybe what I wish you could do and that the keyboard sort the keyboard
[22:58.260 --> 23:03.900]  System preference panel doesn't let you do is map that tilde key to escape
[23:05.060 --> 23:10.160]  You know the little backtick tilde key, which I forget what I said about it that I don't use Tilda much
[23:10.160 --> 23:12.160]  but I know I use backticks for
[23:13.220 --> 23:18.700]  Code blocks in markdown, which is in turn a problem for that. I never foresaw it
[23:19.300 --> 23:26.500]  When I created markdown because like certain keyboards around the world don't have a easily access backtick character
[23:28.060 --> 23:32.620]  But anyway, I think it was actually Daniel jock it I mentioned twice already in this episode who?
[23:33.180 --> 23:36.540]  Texted me after listening and said I'll bet you use Tilda all the time
[23:36.540 --> 23:41.100]  You use command tilde to cycle through windows and I in fact do and I'd forgotten about that
[23:41.780 --> 23:45.980]  But anyway, I thought that would be a good tip just to mention out there for people because it might be one of those little
[23:45.980 --> 23:53.140]  Things that people don't know but on the Mac you can in a window in an app with multiple windows open you can use the
[23:53.940 --> 23:55.940]  Tilde key command tilde and
[23:56.780 --> 23:58.780]  cycle through the open windows
[23:58.860 --> 24:03.660]  Yeah, I use that all the time in fact speaking of mechanical keyboards. I had a really weird mechanical keyboard
[24:03.660 --> 24:06.560]  I used for a while that did not have the backtick
[24:06.860 --> 24:12.940]  Key or at least didn't have it in the right place and I had to do some keyboard maestro again using a giant tool
[24:12.940 --> 24:14.700]  For a really stupid job
[24:14.700 --> 24:20.300]  To remap it to I think maybe command escape because I think the escape key was in that same
[24:20.940 --> 24:22.100]  and
[24:22.100 --> 24:26.840]  That was dumb, but it I really needed it because I suddenly couldn't cycle through windows
[24:26.840 --> 24:36.260]  Or type or type of code block and markdown which I do from time to time and and then it was just like somebody cut
[24:36.260 --> 24:38.260]  off one of my fingers
[24:38.640 --> 24:43.040]  All right. Let me take a break here before we really get going on. Thank our first sponsor. It's our good friends at
[24:43.880 --> 24:45.880]  Squarespace
[24:46.040 --> 24:48.040]  Look next time you need to make a website

[25:01.840 --> 25:06.540]  Dragging and dropping little components out like, you know and rearranging them on screen
[25:07.440 --> 25:09.440]  and
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.120]  Make your own brand like if you have you know, you know
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.560]  Let's say you're you're creating a restaurant website and your restaurant has you know
[25:19.560 --> 25:25.840]  Logo and stuff like that. You can all that stuff you can put in there just because you start with a template doesn't mean you're
[25:25.840 --> 25:27.200]  stuck with
[25:27.200 --> 25:29.200]  Something that isn't easily and fully

[25:33.600 --> 25:37.560]  or if it's a personal site and you're making a little portfolio to show your work or

[27:30.340 --> 27:35.540]  Am on the train. We have a SodaStream and also we've been lately. We've just been stuck in the fridge with
[27:36.180 --> 27:38.180]  La Croix stuff too. Yeah
[27:38.260 --> 27:43.380]  So I everybody knows everybody listens to this show knows I've been a SodaStream user for years
[27:43.380 --> 27:45.380]  I really am a big fan of their product
[27:46.100 --> 27:51.300]  I've got the penguin. I know they have a bunch of different ones and I think some of their their lower-priced ones aren't as
[27:51.300 --> 27:57.380]  Honestly powerful the penguin that I have doesn't take plastic bottles. It takes glass bottles
[27:58.020 --> 28:02.980]  And they've got a real nice top that you can squeeze on the old tops. I see and I
[28:04.420 --> 28:08.580]  The thing is is that with the penguin at least you can carbonate it as much as you want
[28:08.580 --> 28:11.780]  It's not like it gets to a certain standard level of carbonation and stops
[28:11.780 --> 28:18.260]  You just keep pushing down on the beak of the penguin and it keeps adding more carbonation and and they usually they say it
[28:18.260 --> 28:24.340]  I get beep it like squeaks when it gets to like hey, this is pretty carbonated like what most people would consider fizzy water
[28:24.340 --> 28:28.420]  I usually go to about six squeaks. I just give it about five five or six more
[28:29.940 --> 28:36.020]  And with the old the original caps I had with the penguin they only lasted about six months for me because even though they they kind
[28:36.020 --> 28:40.820]  Of screwed on and had gaskets like the level of carbonation I had in there would crack them
[28:41.220 --> 28:45.300]  Like the glass didn't crack but the bottle caps did and now they have a new cap design
[28:45.300 --> 28:48.740]  For the last few years. I still love the product but
[28:50.340 --> 28:55.140]  I was up where my family was up with the Marco Arment and Tiff Arment family in
[28:55.780 --> 29:00.980]  New York at the beach a while back people who listen to ATP know that there was a there was a
[29:02.580 --> 29:07.300]  A risky moment where mid mid ATP episode a torrential downpour happened
[29:07.300 --> 29:10.020]  Marco realized all of the windows in the house were open
[29:10.020 --> 29:15.300]  And I also remembered that I left my 15-inch MacBook Pro review unit on the kitchen table
[29:15.300 --> 29:20.260]  Which is right next to an open window, which which window does not have any sort of awning?
[29:21.300 --> 29:23.300]  and he
[29:23.460 --> 29:25.700]  Went over it but I was lucky enough the lid was closed
[29:25.700 --> 29:30.260]  There were a couple of drops on the on the lid but nothing on the keyboard or anything and the machine is fine
[29:30.260 --> 29:33.940]  But apparently I still haven't gotten I'm still like an episode or two behind on ATP
[29:34.180 --> 29:35.220]  Haven't listened to that one yet
[29:35.220 --> 29:40.180]  And apparently it was sort of left open up in the air with whether John Gruber's review unit was
[29:41.940 --> 29:48.260]  Rains drenched or not. But anyway on this trip to Fire Island, New York
[29:49.300 --> 29:55.940]  I found a new product and it's called howls HAL, you know, sort of like the computer howls New York seltzer water
[29:57.620 --> 30:03.380]  And it is it is fantastic one of the reasons it's fantastic is because it's got a lot of
[30:03.380 --> 30:10.980]  Fantastic. One of the reasons it's fantastic is it seltzer water not and I'm not exactly sure on exactly what the difference is between
[30:12.420 --> 30:13.220]  Like
[30:13.220 --> 30:16.900]  All the different fizzy plain waters like seltzer water and club soda club
[30:16.980 --> 30:20.980]  Soda has some kind of like I like to technically be club soda. You have to have like some kind of
[30:21.520 --> 30:23.520]  potassium or something added
[30:23.620 --> 30:27.700]  Um for to me when I just get like a club soda at a restaurant or something
[30:27.780 --> 30:29.780]  It just tastes like fizzy water to me
[30:29.780 --> 30:37.300]  Um, but seltzer water is artificially carbonated, which is what I want because naturally carbonated water is not fizzy enough, right?
[30:37.620 --> 30:39.620]  this house
[30:39.780 --> 30:44.740]  Seltzer water is the busiest goddamn commercial seltzer water i've ever seen in my life
[30:45.380 --> 30:47.300]  I want you to listen. I've got a sealed bottle here
[30:48.260 --> 30:49.060]  See if we can do that
[30:49.060 --> 30:54.740]  I'm, hopefully I won't ruin the computer because usually even without shaking the bottle and having it in the fridge for days
[30:55.060 --> 30:57.060]  It'll still explode out of the bottle
[30:57.620 --> 30:59.620]  Listen to this
[30:59.620 --> 31:01.620]  Oh
[31:02.340 --> 31:04.900]  There there it went holy cow
[31:05.940 --> 31:07.940]  Oh got the computer a little wet
[31:08.500 --> 31:10.340]  It'll be all right
[31:10.340 --> 31:11.940]  um
[31:11.940 --> 31:14.100]  It's been wet before it's been wet before
[31:15.140 --> 31:16.260]  um
[31:16.260 --> 31:21.940]  It is fantastic. And here's the thing. Here's the thing that's really got me going and it's got my whole family addicted to it
[31:22.180 --> 31:24.500]  Is that they have a black cherry version?
[31:24.500 --> 31:31.700]  It's just some kind of natural black cherry flavoring zero calories. No sweeteners at all, but it sort of tastes like
[31:32.580 --> 31:38.740]  Unsweetened dr. Pepper, which is one of my all-time fact. I don't really drink sugared soda water anymore
[31:38.820 --> 31:42.740]  But uh back when I did I loved dr. Pepper. This stuff is
[31:43.380 --> 31:48.420]  Absolutely fantastic and you can uh get it mail or you go to the howl new york
[31:49.540 --> 31:53.780]  Just google howls new york seltzer water. They don't sell directly but they have links to two distribution
[31:53.780 --> 31:59.060]  To two distributors who do and it's somewhat reasonably priced. But anyway, I gotta throw that out there to all my
[31:59.940 --> 32:01.940]  fizzy water drinking
[32:02.020 --> 32:04.020]  listeners
[32:05.700 --> 32:08.260]  But i'm telling you when you get the first bottle watch out
[32:10.180 --> 32:14.340]  This stuff is explosive. Yeah, you know i've i've been buying um
[32:15.540 --> 32:22.180]  The firestone brewery makes uh a stout that I really like that is called the velvet merlin
[32:22.180 --> 32:29.140]  Which always makes me laugh because I know I know somebody named merlin. That's actually my nickname for merlin. It's the velvet merlin sure
[32:29.140 --> 32:33.060]  Well, they now have a uh, a nitro merlin that they have in a can
[32:33.860 --> 32:38.900]  So it's it's nitro bubbles instead of carbon dioxide. So it's nitrogen bubbles. So they're smaller
[32:39.220 --> 32:42.260]  and the idea is that it's more like a traditional kind of irish stout where it's
[32:42.740 --> 32:48.500]  It's it's creamier and the little bubbles have this kind of effect where it starts out looking completely
[32:48.500 --> 32:53.060]  Uh, white with bubbles and then the bubbles all just kind of like slowly migrate to the top
[32:53.060 --> 32:58.340]  It's it puts on a show. But anyway, it it is fascinating because it is
[32:58.960 --> 33:01.700]  Counterintuitive to how you always have been taught to deal with fizzy
[33:02.340 --> 33:06.820]  Objects that are in pressurized containers the side of the nitro merlin can says
[33:07.460 --> 33:10.820]  Flip this can up and down at least three times
[33:11.860 --> 33:16.900]  Then open and pour it as hard as possible into a glass
[33:16.900 --> 33:22.900]  Because the idea is you really actually want to agitate those nitro bubbles and get them out of there, which is great
[33:22.980 --> 33:29.700]  It is huge fun. It is a show every time I open one, but I will say when you open it you will get um,
[33:30.100 --> 33:32.100]  stout fizz
[33:32.340 --> 33:34.340]  Just sort of aerated all over you
[33:34.900 --> 33:36.900]  It's just uh, it's part of the show I guess
[33:40.500 --> 33:44.100]  I actually I really was joking when I thought that this would fizz all over the
[33:44.100 --> 33:48.740]  It's all over my lap it is all over my shirt and there's quite a bit on this macbook
[33:50.820 --> 33:55.620]  Seems okay good test of the uh, with that membrane cover, I guess. Yeah, sure
[33:57.300 --> 34:01.620]  Well, all right that brings us to I guess to uh,
[34:02.580 --> 34:09.060]  News, uh, I wrote this week about this, uh, as I call it this new macbook air successor thing
[34:09.060 --> 34:12.740]  Which is effective what I tried to do is I tried to square three things
[34:13.220 --> 34:19.300]  What makes you know in terms of what apple might be doing with macbooks the macbook lineup for the rest of this year?
[34:20.500 --> 34:26.180]  Because just just last month they updated the touch bar macbook pros 13 inch and 15 inch
[34:28.020 --> 34:30.020]  With you know faster processors
[34:30.820 --> 34:36.420]  True tone displays and this third generation butterfly keyboard that has a lot of features
[34:36.420 --> 34:42.900]  This third generation butterfly keyboard that has some kind of membrane that supposedly keeps out dust, etc
[34:43.860 --> 34:45.860]  but they didn't update the uh
[34:46.260 --> 34:52.420]  The non-touch bar macbook pro 13 inch aka the macbook escape didn't update the 12-inch macbook
[34:52.900 --> 34:56.660]  And apple hasn't updated the macbook air since the late 1990s
[34:57.620 --> 35:00.900]  Um or so it seems yeah, um
[35:00.900 --> 35:05.460]  So I tried to speculate what apple apple might do that would make sense for apple
[35:06.500 --> 35:09.780]  What apple might do that would be appealing to customers?
[35:10.340 --> 35:15.300]  And then the third thing I tried to do is square it with what has been reported by
[35:16.180 --> 35:19.220]  Bloomberg's mark german who had a piece earlier this week
[35:21.060 --> 35:25.060]  And he had written about it a few months ago right before wwdc
[35:25.860 --> 35:28.900]  Which uh and digitimes chinese
[35:28.900 --> 35:34.580]  Or taiwanese, I forget uh trade paper that often has rumors, especially from the display industry had written
[35:35.620 --> 35:41.220]  And I think ming qi quo. I didn't link to him, but even ming qi quo who usually only writes about iphones and ipads
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.540]  He had something to say about it
[35:44.100 --> 35:48.340]  And trying to square all three of those things what apple would do
[35:49.300 --> 35:55.380]  That's good for apple and what was appealing to customers and what fits with this reporting?
[35:55.380 --> 35:59.460]  Is really hard to do and took me I thought this would be great and it you know
[35:59.460 --> 36:03.860]  It often works like this for me at least is I think this is something that I would love to write about
[36:03.860 --> 36:06.180]  It doesn't seem like anybody else has really written about
[36:06.660 --> 36:12.900]  It seems like people are confused already by what i'm trying to say because when I first linked to the german story
[36:13.860 --> 36:17.780]  I was trying to make all the points. I ended up spending two thousand words
[36:18.820 --> 36:22.820]  Making and therefore I it's no surprise that I was misinterpreting
[36:22.820 --> 36:26.260]  And therefore I it's no surprise that I was misunderstood. Um
[36:27.140 --> 36:29.140]  But it is complicated
[36:29.220 --> 36:32.820]  And I could think of nobody better to talk about it with than somebody who i've talked about macbook
[36:33.540 --> 36:35.940]  lineups with uh many times before
[36:36.500 --> 36:41.140]  It is super complicated and I I laughed when I read your piece about how you
[36:41.460 --> 36:44.580]  Like started thinking one thing and then halfway through you're like, wait a second
[36:45.140 --> 36:48.020]  And started to think something else because that has happened to me too
[36:48.820 --> 36:50.900]  writing and talking about this issue because
[36:50.900 --> 36:56.340]  There is sometimes you know, there are apple rumors and it's just like very clear what the product is going to be
[36:56.580 --> 37:02.660]  But with this there are a bunch of different ways that could go none of them feels as you elaborate none of them feels
[37:03.220 --> 37:05.380]  Particularly satisfying like oh, oh, that's it
[37:05.380 --> 37:10.200]  That's the one they're going to do because they all involve kind of choices that seem kind of un-apple-like
[37:10.580 --> 37:15.700]  Which I think is rooted in this idea that I know you and I have talked about that the macbook
[37:15.700 --> 37:23.080]  the macbook which I think somebody thought at some point in the process that that would replace the macbook air but at 12.99
[37:23.780 --> 37:30.100]  It's 300 too expensive to replace the macbook air and that that seems to have surprised somebody somewhere at apple
[37:30.340 --> 37:35.220]  And has led them in this weird position where they couldn't get rid of the air and now what do they replace it with?
[37:35.620 --> 37:36.820]  and
[37:36.820 --> 37:42.020]  I think that's part of the problem here is that is that they're still kind of like trying to figure out how to
[37:42.420 --> 37:44.420]  deal with the fact that they've got the
[37:44.420 --> 37:46.020]  macbook pro escape
[37:46.020 --> 37:52.180]  13-inch they've got the macbook and then they've got this macbook air and like they seem to have rationalized kind of the top
[37:52.660 --> 37:54.660]  pro level of their laptops
[37:54.740 --> 37:56.660]  uh this year, but
[37:56.660 --> 38:01.220]  The consumer part is the other shoe that has to drop and we all know it
[38:01.540 --> 38:05.460]  The fact that the escape didn't get updated also suggests that something is going on there
[38:05.620 --> 38:11.140]  I wonder about if it's really going to stay a macbook pro or if it's going to graduate to or get demoted or whatever
[38:11.140 --> 38:16.340]  To something else but something's got to give because they can't keep selling that macbook air forever
[38:16.660 --> 38:20.040]  But as you said none of the suspects
[38:20.980 --> 38:24.740]  Are like the stone cold lock where you're like, that's what they're going to do
[38:24.980 --> 38:28.500]  Yeah, I there's so many ways it could turn out and i'd be like, okay, I get it
[38:28.580 --> 38:32.580]  but none none of them are to me like in advance a lock and the one thing that that
[38:33.780 --> 38:35.380]  that
[38:35.380 --> 38:38.260]  Blinded me at first and I think you'll agree
[38:38.260 --> 38:41.380]  I think you're you'll be in say you're in the same boat with me on this is
[38:41.940 --> 38:44.580]  That there have been times when apple's entire
[38:45.380 --> 38:52.020]  Portable strategy and I know that I just for the first time in my life. I noticed this week while researching this going back
[38:52.580 --> 38:54.580]  That when apple needs a word
[38:55.860 --> 38:57.700]  I don't think they're 100 consistent on this
[38:57.700 --> 39:02.020]  I think they've said the word laptop at some point and maybe said notebook at some point
[39:02.020 --> 39:06.020]  But rather than laptop or notebook and I often equivocate between the two
[39:06.020 --> 39:10.420]  Um, because my problem with laptop is it implies you have to use it on your lap
[39:11.060 --> 39:12.980]  like and
[39:12.980 --> 39:15.620]  I very seldom other than when i'm on an airplane use my
[39:16.820 --> 39:19.780]  Use my portable computer on a on my actual lap
[39:20.660 --> 39:21.540]  um
[39:21.540 --> 39:24.580]  But if you use the word laptop people know what it means, right?
[39:24.660 --> 39:29.620]  And maybe it's just like forget about the origins people know what you mean when you say a laptop, right? Um,
[39:29.620 --> 39:36.660]  But i've noticed that apple often calls them portables, you know portable mac. Um, but anyway, so i'll use the word portable
[39:36.660 --> 39:41.620]  But apple's portable mac lineup at times has had extraordinary clarity
[39:42.900 --> 39:48.260]  dating back to like the original little quadrant that steve jobs had in 1998 of
[39:48.900 --> 39:54.500]  look, we've got portables and desktops and we have consumer products and
[39:55.140 --> 39:57.540]  professional products and our
[39:57.540 --> 39:58.980]  portable
[39:58.980 --> 40:01.700]  Consumer product is the iBook and our portable
[40:02.740 --> 40:07.940]  Professional is the at the time power book and maybe there's multiple power books
[40:07.940 --> 40:13.140]  Usually there's multiple power books, but at least the basic idea of the lineup is has this sort of clarity
[40:14.900 --> 40:15.860]  And
[40:15.860 --> 40:21.140]  When there were pl you know, you know, maybe eight years later when there were those plastic macbooks
[40:21.140 --> 40:26.180]  Remember when they remember when the black macbook cost more than the white one even though it was the same price
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.180]  Even though it was the same material
[40:29.380 --> 40:32.980]  Oh, yeah, I had one of those I paid the black tax on that for sure
[40:33.220 --> 40:38.420]  I I never had one of those but I would have absolutely paid the black tax on that because
[40:39.140 --> 40:42.340]  I've always if I have the choice between a black and white I
[40:42.900 --> 40:44.900]  Don't think i've ever chosen
[40:44.900 --> 40:46.900]  white
[40:48.340 --> 40:51.860]  I always think of that when I think of the the premium that they charge on the new
[40:51.860 --> 40:56.820]  keyboard and mouse and trackpad for the iMac pro like it's
[40:58.340 --> 41:01.380]  Everybody knows they're cool. Everybody knows darker is cooler, but
[41:02.580 --> 41:04.740]  But that was a very clear lineup the plastic
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.820]  macbooks
[41:06.820 --> 41:13.620]  versus the aluminum macbook pros and then just looking at the specs and you know everything about them it the
[41:13.860 --> 41:18.260]  Why this one cost more than that one and why you might want one over the other was very clear
[41:18.260 --> 41:22.980]  And then I think that the clearest that the apple laptop line has ever been
[41:23.860 --> 41:28.820]  and and maybe like the it's it's just the high water mark was when the the
[41:30.100 --> 41:32.100]  The macbook air
[41:32.260 --> 41:38.420]  First took over the low end and and they didn't have anything. They no longer had a computer called just the macbook
[41:39.860 --> 41:44.500]  Maybe naming wise that didn't quite make as much sense. But when it was an 899
[41:44.500 --> 41:51.620]  899 11 inch macbook air a 999 starting point 13 inch macbook air
[41:52.820 --> 41:54.180]  and then
[41:54.180 --> 42:00.420]  Thicker heavier macbook pros of 13 and 15 at a higher price point that was to me
[42:01.060 --> 42:07.700]  Very clear and I don't know that the lower end models had ever or even since have ever been
[42:08.260 --> 42:09.460]  so appealing
[42:09.460 --> 42:11.460]  In terms of there were people who could afford
[42:11.460 --> 42:17.140]  a three thousand dollar macbook pro and we're happy with in a you know, slightly upgraded
[42:17.140 --> 42:20.500]  1199 macbook air because they actually preferred it in every way
[42:21.540 --> 42:26.020]  I was one of those people. I mean I have a right right near me right over my shoulder right now a
[42:27.620 --> 42:29.220]  an I
[42:29.220 --> 42:33.780]  Five seven maybe a macbook air 11 inch right like
[42:34.340 --> 42:37.140]  maxed out settings but in this little tiny macbook air so
[42:37.140 --> 42:42.260]  I always I always like those and and I think you're right there was there was some clarity that again
[42:42.260 --> 42:47.940]  I I keep coming back to like the the root of this the kind of original sin of this
[42:48.580 --> 42:56.500]  Seems to me in the retina transition on the laptops the macbook could the macbook design they they made
[42:56.500 --> 42:58.500]  To replace the macbook air
[42:59.540 --> 43:05.060]  Was more expensive than they thought it would be and although there's plenty of profit margin built in there
[43:05.060 --> 43:13.460]  You know that apple has some rules internally about what pro what every product has to throw off in terms of margin
[43:13.940 --> 43:20.260]  And for whatever reason that macbook ended up being way more expensive than I I suspect they intended because I gotta think
[43:20.500 --> 43:22.500]  that macbook was intended to be
[43:22.800 --> 43:26.520]  Eventually to rest at if not 999 then like 1099
[43:27.460 --> 43:31.220]  And they just haven't been able to do it. And so then there's this like well, wait a second
[43:31.220 --> 43:37.460]  We renamed this as the macbook and that's one of your big questions in your article is like what do you even call it?
[43:37.460 --> 43:43.060]  Let's assume that it's not actually a macbook air because I don't think it will be but that there's a new model
[43:43.460 --> 43:48.100]  A new model that's intended to be sub a thousand dollars assuming that there's no way for them to get
[43:48.340 --> 43:52.180]  The macbook to start at 999 which they might be able to do
[43:52.420 --> 43:57.380]  But it's so compromised that I I don't know whether people would rush to buy it like they did the macbook air
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.620]  But like let's just assume there's a new model
[43:59.620 --> 44:00.580]  and
[44:00.580 --> 44:03.300]  What name do they give it because they already took?
[44:03.940 --> 44:11.460]  generic plain macbook and put it in the 12 inch that we know and if they make like a 13 inch model, but it
[44:11.940 --> 44:13.860]  Isn't as nice and it costs less
[44:13.940 --> 44:17.380]  So you're paying more for a smaller laptop like they could do that
[44:17.460 --> 44:22.500]  but I wouldn't say that that provides crystal clarity to the line and so
[44:23.140 --> 44:28.260]  That I think that's at the root of us looking at this and scratching our heads is that um to a certain degree
[44:28.260 --> 44:32.740]  They're going to be doing I think a little bit of damage control because they just didn't quite
[44:33.220 --> 44:35.860]  It didn't happen the way they thought maybe it would happen originally
[44:36.180 --> 44:41.460]  Yeah, and I don't by any means think that the 12-inch macbook is a dud or a failure. I see a fair amount of them
[44:41.860 --> 44:46.900]  my daughter has one and she loves it and I I play around with it and I think it's really great and if I
[44:47.380 --> 44:53.300]  Wasn't using my ipad so much now. I would almost certainly have gotten that 12-inch macbook because it's so
[44:53.780 --> 44:57.460]  Uh light and you know, it's it's it's fun. It's not gonna
[44:57.460 --> 45:00.740]  You know, it's not a professional tool, but it is it's pretty great
[45:01.540 --> 45:08.180]  The screen is gorgeous and it's super small and light and it gets great battery life. Yeah. Yeah, my daughter loves her absolutely loves it
[45:08.980 --> 45:10.980]  I am
[45:11.220 --> 45:14.740]  98 percent sure that and again it you know
[45:14.980 --> 45:18.740]  This isn't this doesn't prove that he actually uses it on a regular basis
[45:18.740 --> 45:24.820]  I mean it might have been a choice but when when when there was that weird, uh, hey, we're gonna do a mac pro
[45:24.820 --> 45:31.400]  Mac pro thing at apple where they had me and panzerino and lance ullenoff and john patskowski
[45:32.100 --> 45:34.100]  And you know freed
[45:34.180 --> 45:38.100]  Um, I think that was everybody who was invited just the five of us and they were doing it
[45:38.260 --> 45:40.260]  She had a little powerpoint presentation
[45:40.900 --> 45:43.460]  For some of you know, just for what he wanted to talk through and it was
[45:44.260 --> 45:50.180]  On a macbook, uh 12-inch macbook and he was going through it and I I really do get the impression that that was his macbook
[45:50.180 --> 45:54.660]  You know that he made this, you know, because it wasn't a big deal. I mean, why wouldn't it be it was his macbook?
[45:55.220 --> 45:56.020]  um
[45:56.020 --> 45:59.140]  And he was talking about it at one point and he had it on the whole time
[45:59.220 --> 46:02.020]  And I don't know we were like an hour and five minutes into it and he like turned it around
[46:02.100 --> 46:06.340]  He was like look i've still got 99 battery life. I mean, it's it's really it's from it
[46:06.420 --> 46:09.940]  He's like I love this thing, but it really is a tremendous computer
[46:10.420 --> 46:15.220]  But I do think that there's an awful lot of people who look at it and think it's too small
[46:15.220 --> 46:19.940]  Like I think people look at a 13-inch laptop and think that's a normal laptop size
[46:21.060 --> 46:26.200]  And you know a 13-inch is actually, you know, at least by apple's 13-inch is 13.3
[46:27.380 --> 46:30.340]  uh and those little 0.3s, you know measure up like a third, you know,
[46:31.380 --> 46:36.580]  The the the 12-inch macbook looks you know, 12 and 13 don't sound like vastly different numbers
[46:36.820 --> 46:41.140]  But when you look at a macbook next to a 13-inch macbook pro it looks tiny
[46:41.140 --> 46:47.140]  Tiny truly tiny and I really feel like it might be too small to be their best-selling model
[46:48.020 --> 46:50.580]  Yeah, I think so. I mean as an 11-inch macbook air user
[46:50.740 --> 46:55.460]  It was definitely an outlier and most people thought that was a bridge too far to go down to 11 inches
[46:55.540 --> 46:57.460]  But the 13 worked for them
[46:57.460 --> 47:03.220]  yeah, and I was for years, you know, long-time listeners of the show know that I I I think my current
[47:03.540 --> 47:08.500]  30 personal 13-inch macbook pro is might be my longest running personally used
[47:08.500 --> 47:13.380]  Laptop, and if it's not it probably will be by the time I replace it because i've had it at least four years at this point
[47:14.180 --> 47:18.100]  uh and love it, but I had an 11-inch macbook air for a long time and
[47:18.900 --> 47:20.980]  Really liked it in a lot of ways. Um
[47:21.700 --> 47:26.180]  And especially when traveling man, that thing was just it's just um, it was just unbelievable
[47:26.180 --> 47:29.460]  I had I forget which you know, tom binh has like 30 different
[47:30.100 --> 47:35.140]  gazillion little over-the-shoulder bags, but I got one that was like meant for like an 11-inch air
[47:35.140 --> 47:37.140]  11-inch air
[47:38.260 --> 47:39.460]  And
[47:39.460 --> 47:45.860]  It honestly I could sometimes i'd be like getting on an airplane and I just couldn't believe how small this bag was with a complete
[47:46.660 --> 47:49.560]  MacBook setup in it. It just seemed impossible
[47:52.180 --> 47:53.620]  And you know come to think of it
[47:53.620 --> 47:58.980]  I never really thought about this before but the years when I was using that 11-inch macbook air as my travel computer was
[47:59.380 --> 48:01.060]  when my son was
[48:01.060 --> 48:02.500]  a lot younger
[48:02.500 --> 48:08.100]  And anybody who's traveled with even just I don't even just one young child you really
[48:09.140 --> 48:11.860]  You really wind up schlepping an awful lot of stuff
[48:12.580 --> 48:14.580]  in and out of cars cabs
[48:15.380 --> 48:17.380]  monorails, uh
[48:18.180 --> 48:26.740]  And airport, uh overhead bins, uh, so it sounds ridiculous to think that the difference between an 11 and 13-inch macbook air would really
[48:26.740 --> 48:32.100]  Make it but it it whether it really really did it made me think it did, you know
[48:32.260 --> 48:34.580]  It really felt like well at least i'm saving something here
[48:35.220 --> 48:40.900]  Oh, yeah, every time I open the thing up. I'm like, oh, it's so it's so small, right and and although my daughter's
[48:41.300 --> 48:46.580]  Computer does the same thing right that 12-inch macbook. So okay. So what is it then? What is this thing?
[48:46.820 --> 48:49.620]  I I would say that also that in the bloomberg story
[48:49.700 --> 48:53.220]  They don't actually say they kind of put it in the context of the macbook air
[48:53.220 --> 48:59.780]  But they don't say what what it's actually going to cost just that it's low cost and that it's sort of a replacement for the macbook
[48:59.860 --> 49:04.580]  Air, it's all very hazy like and again mark german great sources the facts
[49:04.580 --> 49:08.660]  He reports I believe are facts. I believe it, but then they have to build a story around it
[49:08.660 --> 49:13.620]  And then we all kind of add our own assumptions. So yes, what do you think like what is this thing?
[49:14.020 --> 49:19.220]  What what is it going to be right what I tried to point out when I first linked to this report was that I I?
[49:19.220 --> 49:25.540]  I maybe I should just stuck to saying this raises more questions than it answers and and there's this whole contingent of people who who?
[49:25.700 --> 49:28.500]  I point these things out about german reports publicly
[49:29.140 --> 49:33.460]  And then I get so much twitter feedback of why are you jealous? Why do you hate german?
[49:33.460 --> 49:35.700]  Why you know you it's a bad look john
[49:35.700 --> 49:39.940]  Why do you always every time german has one of these reports you shit all over it, you know, it's a bad look
[49:39.940 --> 49:44.500]  He's doing great work. He's better writer than you. I mean I get it all and that's it
[49:44.500 --> 49:49.780]  And that's it. It doesn't really bother me except that I feel like i'm being misunderstood and I worry that
[49:50.100 --> 49:51.860]  I don't worry that people are saying that about me
[49:51.860 --> 49:57.300]  I just worry that i've i'm failing as a writer because i've clearly failed to convey what i'm trying to say, which is that
[49:58.740 --> 50:04.740]  Basically this report let's just take it all as true and he usually is right and what he wrote here
[50:04.740 --> 50:06.740]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's word for word true
[50:07.140 --> 50:11.060]  Raises a lot more questions than it provides answers and i'm not criticizing him
[50:11.060 --> 50:14.340]  you know, he's got a scoop here that nobody else seems to have but
[50:16.420 --> 50:18.420]  You know either his source
[50:19.140 --> 50:25.700]  Doesn't know the spec knows that it's coming out and knows that it's supposed to be low cost and knows that it looks quote similar
[50:26.100 --> 50:28.100]  to the current macbook air
[50:28.420 --> 50:33.540]  And doesn't know anything else or he has a source who does know more but wasn't willing to tell him more
[50:34.260 --> 50:36.260]  Or wasn't willing to tell him more
[50:36.260 --> 50:43.300]  For publication, you know, there's all sorts of ways that that could work out where and and I feel like what some people who and
[50:45.460 --> 50:50.980]  People aren't supposed to know the inside baseball and it's like the the people who compliment me sometimes when I write things like this
[50:51.140 --> 50:55.940]  Are like colleagues, you know, and I say hey that was good when you called that out or on something something
[50:56.420 --> 50:57.540]  um
[50:57.540 --> 50:59.540]  what people you know
[51:00.260 --> 51:04.420]  Who aren't in the industry who aren't writers don't really think about is they don't think about
[51:04.420 --> 51:07.220]  Who the source is I read this story and I immediately think well
[51:07.220 --> 51:12.180]  Who's who could possibly be the source for this and why wouldn't they know more and then I immediately think oh wait
[51:12.260 --> 51:15.540]  they might know more and either didn't tell him or
[51:16.580 --> 51:17.940]  uh
[51:17.940 --> 51:21.380]  Or told him and and insisted that he couldn't publish more than what he did
[51:21.780 --> 51:25.540]  Yeah, my gut feeling with all of these and I agree with you. Um
[51:26.260 --> 51:31.700]  The always ask why somebody's giving the information out and right who who they are
[51:31.700 --> 51:37.780]  Because that's like fundamental like every time that there's like a controversial thing about a project that's been killed or something like that. It's like
[51:38.340 --> 51:40.900]  Who would be motivated to do that? So just something like this
[51:40.900 --> 51:47.540]  I imagine the way apple is is siloed that this is somebody who has heard or knows a little bit
[51:47.700 --> 51:52.260]  But doesn't know the whole story and they they're happy to give mark german tidbits, right?
[51:52.260 --> 51:55.860]  It's like literally all they know and I think german again
[51:56.580 --> 52:00.340]  I really think highly of him. I think he does a great job as a reporter
[52:00.340 --> 52:04.020]  I think in the context of bloomberg as opposed to back when he was on nine to five mac
[52:04.820 --> 52:06.820]  Bloomberg wants him to
[52:07.300 --> 52:13.140]  Write these kind of larger narratives in which his stuff is embedded and it can lead to
[52:14.020 --> 52:19.940]  Us all looking at the story and going wait a second. There's a thousand words here, but there's really like five facts
[52:20.660 --> 52:26.340]  And I I think it doesn't you know, sometimes those stories are really great when he's got a lot of extra tidbits
[52:26.340 --> 52:33.380]  But when he doesn't have a lot of extra tidbits it comes across that they're trying to create kind of a really thin gruel, right?
[52:33.380 --> 52:38.820]  They're they're trying to stretch their what they've got by putting in a lot of water or a lot of filler
[52:38.820 --> 52:42.820]  And I think this is a good example of that because we we don't know a lot
[52:42.820 --> 52:46.820]  He doesn't know a lot but he has some tidbits like he's he's basically saying and I believe i'm like
[52:47.380 --> 52:53.380]  Low-cost laptop coming into the mac line gonna happen like totally great. But um, whoever he talked to
[52:53.380 --> 53:00.340]  Whoever he talked to you're right either wouldn't say or I think more likely doesn't know because like above
[53:00.580 --> 53:06.200]  It's above their pay grade like they they're working in a part of apple where they got like a little bit of a glancing
[53:06.980 --> 53:12.660]  Blow like where they're like, I I know just enough but no more because those people are probably
[53:13.300 --> 53:15.860]  either aware that they're being surveilled or
[53:16.580 --> 53:20.260]  Are are very good employees who want to make sure that it's a secret, right?
[53:20.260 --> 53:24.660]  Um, so just to reiterate for anybody, you know, I'll go over this in my article
[53:24.660 --> 53:30.260]  but it's good to talk about but like the actual facts about this machine that he that his report lists and it is I should
[53:30.260 --> 53:34.100]  Add it is uh, co-bi-lined with debbie woo at bloomberg
[53:35.140 --> 53:40.820]  So we're making some assumptions here about the sources coming from german and who knows they could have come from debbie woo
[53:41.300 --> 53:43.140]  So it you know
[53:43.140 --> 53:48.820]  no slight intended but I don't you know, I think most people assume that the the sources are german's and maybe
[53:48.820 --> 53:54.980]  Some of the rest of the narrative comes from her but so we'll just say bloomberg. We don't know. Yeah, right. We don't know but
[53:56.260 --> 53:58.980]  Apple will release a new low-cost laptop
[54:00.340 --> 54:07.700]  And a professional focused upgrade to the mac mini desktop later this year. All right, we can get back to the this new mac mini later
[54:09.540 --> 54:11.540]  Next paragraph or you know, uh,
[54:11.540 --> 54:18.500]  According to people familiar with the plans the new laptop will look similar to the current macbook air
[54:18.820 --> 54:25.540]  But will include thinner bezels around the screen the display which will remain about 13 inches will be a higher resolution
[54:25.620 --> 54:29.220]  quote retina version that apple uses on other products that people said
[54:30.180 --> 54:31.540]  And that's it
[54:31.540 --> 54:36.420]  That is literally the entire description of this and the the thing, you know
[54:36.420 --> 54:42.180]  And the the thing, you know, like I said, I have I have these assumptions that apple wants to get back
[54:42.580 --> 54:45.860]  To a simple lineup of macbooks and macbook pros
[54:46.900 --> 54:52.260]  uh, you know one two, uh, that may be a bad assumption and i've revisited
[54:52.900 --> 54:57.940]  Um, I think there's an awful lot of people out there. I know that there's a lot of people I hear it on twitter
[54:58.020 --> 54:59.940]  I hear it see it in my email from daring fireball
[54:59.940 --> 55:05.860]  I know that there are a lot of people who for three or four years have been clamoring for one specific thing
[55:05.860 --> 55:11.380]  just take the macbook air and put a retina display on it that the one and only thing they don't like about the macbook air as
[55:11.380 --> 55:13.860]  Apple has continued to sell it is the lack of a
[55:14.820 --> 55:18.500]  Retina display. Yeah, and I even saw people I don't know at this point
[55:18.500 --> 55:24.180]  I think enough years have gone by that people sort of expect now that a retinum macbook air would would take over at
[55:24.660 --> 55:28.180]  999 and I think I think looking at the market that's reasonable
[55:28.820 --> 55:35.460]  Especially for a retina display like there's all sorts of other technologies that have cryptin to displays like higher brightness
[55:35.460 --> 55:37.460]  levels and uh
[55:38.100 --> 55:44.100]  Significantly wider color gamuts and now we even have i'm looking at one right now one with true tone
[55:45.380 --> 55:49.860]  Apple could fulfill the number one thing though that people want is is retina, you know
[55:49.940 --> 55:55.860]  So it could be a lower cost retina that doesn't have a true tone and maybe the wide color gamut or something like that
[55:56.260 --> 55:58.260]  And most people would be just fine with that
[55:58.580 --> 56:03.220]  Um, they just all they want is just take a macbook air and stick a goddamn retina screen on it
[56:03.220 --> 56:05.220]  I mean and there's a lot of people yeah
[56:05.380 --> 56:10.260]  Who've wanted that for a while who still want it and when they read this report from Mark Gurman?
[56:11.140 --> 56:17.700]  What they read was apple is going to take the macbook air and stick a retina screen in it and lower the you know
[56:17.940 --> 56:19.940]  Smalling up the bezels. Yeah
[56:20.500 --> 56:25.140]  It doesn't follow especially since the way that it's phrased like looks similar to the macbook air
[56:25.140 --> 56:29.620]  Oh, do you mean that it's gonna be an aluminum laptop? I mean come right like
[56:30.100 --> 56:32.100]  They all look like the macbook air
[56:32.100 --> 56:34.100]  right
[56:34.900 --> 56:40.340]  In some sense every computer apple makes right now looks similar to the macbook air, uh the 13th
[56:41.700 --> 56:44.180]  Maybe if we want to you could rule out the 15-inch, right?
[56:44.180 --> 56:49.700]  You could say 15-inch doesn't look like the macbook air except you could say it looks like a bigger macbook air
[56:50.420 --> 56:51.380]  Yeah, right
[56:51.380 --> 56:54.820]  So i'm not sure I kind of discount that like looks kind of like the macbook air
[56:54.980 --> 56:58.420]  Statement as being almost no information like right we can just discount that
[56:58.420 --> 57:05.540]  Um, but it is I agree. I mean, it's funny the things that people want to and don't want like
[57:06.020 --> 57:08.900]  For lots of good reasons like usba ports magsafe
[57:09.140 --> 57:16.340]  Uh sd card slot like there's so many reasons other than the retina screen and the fact that it is a a processor architecture
[57:16.420 --> 57:19.300]  that would the whole internals would have to be redone because
[57:19.620 --> 57:23.700]  They have run out of road on that processor and they want a more modern processor in there
[57:23.860 --> 57:27.540]  But I feel like what you and I know about apple is if they're going to put time into doing a new
[57:27.540 --> 57:34.100]  Piece of hardware they want to be able to ride it for a few years and uh to rebuild the internals of a macbook air
[57:34.100 --> 57:40.100]  And yet keep everything else the same. I just I can't imagine them doing that which is if I had to guess today
[57:40.100 --> 57:44.580]  I'm, just and I may I I reserve the right to go back on this immediately like while we're talking
[57:44.660 --> 57:48.820]  But if I had to guess today, what I would say is they're going to do two things
[57:49.300 --> 57:54.100]  They're going to I mean they'll update the macbook right and hopefully maybe even cut the price on it a little bit
[57:54.100 --> 57:59.540]  But I think they're going to do two other things. I think I want to predict who knows what I have no information
[57:59.540 --> 58:04.100]  I'm, just guessing that they really want to kind of push that macbook escape down
[58:05.060 --> 58:07.060]  Maybe even take the name pro off of it
[58:07.540 --> 58:08.420]  um
[58:08.420 --> 58:12.580]  And that would be a good kind of like macbook companion
[58:12.660 --> 58:18.180]  There's the macbook 12 and the macbook 13 and here they are and then there's going to be another model
[58:18.180 --> 58:23.700]  With a probably a different name that is going to cut lots of corners
[58:23.860 --> 58:31.160]  It's going to use stuff that is not up to the up to the level of the of the um hardware that's in the other laptops
[58:31.780 --> 58:32.900]  and
[58:32.900 --> 58:36.980]  That's going to allow apple to maintain margin and be under a thousand and I don't know what you call that
[58:36.980 --> 58:38.900]  I still think it's not going to be like a hunk of plastic
[58:38.900 --> 58:40.900]  It's still going to be an aluminum enclosure
[58:40.900 --> 58:45.060]  But if I had to guess based on this german report and the other reports that we've seen
[58:45.060 --> 58:48.100]  That they may have just finally at some point said, you know what?
[58:48.500 --> 58:55.620]  We just need to make a an official cheap not as good laptop to replace the air, but I still think it's going to have usbc
[58:56.340 --> 59:02.180]  And you know and charged by usbc and all of the things that are in modern mac laptops
[59:02.260 --> 59:07.140]  I don't think they're gonna just make a macbook air with a new chip inside and a retina screen, right?
[59:07.220 --> 59:09.380]  Even though I think that that's what a lot of people in fact
[59:09.380 --> 59:12.260]  Even after I wrote it and tried to make the case against that people are like well
[59:12.260 --> 59:16.180]  I hope you're wrong and they still do that and it's like well, I wish you good luck and you know
[59:16.180 --> 59:22.020]  And of course the other thing people along those exact same lines that people are very adamantly hoping
[59:22.500 --> 59:24.580]  Will not change is the keyboard
[59:25.860 --> 59:29.300]  And yeah, oh, yeah. I just don't think that's no I I get it
[59:29.380 --> 59:33.380]  I totally you and I you said in your piece like we totally get it. I wrote a piece
[59:34.260 --> 59:38.260]  Earlier this year for macworld called something like macbook air. Why won't it die and people are like
[59:38.260 --> 59:40.260]  Why are you trying to kill the macbook air and i'm like no no no
[59:40.260 --> 59:44.020]  No, the piece is basically like people won't let it die
[59:44.020 --> 59:48.900]  They keep buying it because they like it and they like magsafe and they like the keyboard and they like the sd card slot
[59:48.900 --> 59:54.100]  And they like usba like all of these things that apple thought were like selling points of the new generation of laptops
[59:54.260 --> 59:56.260]  And people are like, yeah, not really
[59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.740]  And the only things you can say are the processor could be faster and it should have a retina display
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.260]  So, you know totally get it. I just don't believe that apple
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:10.340]  Will would put in all that effort to just make kind of a new version of five years ago's laptop
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:15.140]  Which is what kind of word we're saying it would be. Yeah, and you know
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:18.660]  It is funny because I know that there's I think there's a dell
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:25.700]  Where you know like the bezels surrounding the current macbook pros, uh, these new latest ones
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.860]  Are significantly smaller than the bezels on any macbook apple's ever made
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.340]  and I
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.340]  um, and I
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.900]  Strongly suspect that if this new thing is a low cost
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.300]  um
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:46.900]  Computer that the bezels that's about the best you can hope for but there are other laptop makers out there
[01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:53.380]  Like I think dell in particular, um who have laptops with bezels that make even the macbook pros look small
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:01:00.420]  Um, you know, everybody's in phones tablets everywhere. Everybody's in a race to get edge to edge screens
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.220]  Um, you know and aesthetically I can see why
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.460]  um
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:13.060]  But even if you know and then you look at the air and the air as we know it today really does have ancient looking
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.300]  Bezels, they're not even it
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:22.660]  They're not even black, you know, there's like this big gray thick picture frame around the display. Yeah. I mean it is it is
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:29.620]  Very old display tech because they never changed that screen and there's nice things about it because it's the super thin
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:33.060]  Uh, I always liked it because I thought it was had much less glare
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.500]  On it than the full sheet of glass on a macbook pro
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.140]  I always liked the display on it other than the fact that it's not retina
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:45.300]  It's still like really nice but you the trade-off is that you get rid of that whole edge to edge sheet of glass
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.300]  But it means you got a big silver
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.340]  You know rectangle that you're looking through to see your screen and that's how I mean that's how
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.540]  I mean that is that's apple design styling of like eight years ago ten years ago. It's super old, right?
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.340]  So I can't imagine them sticking with something like that
[01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.980]  Um technology has also advanced a lot in 10 years
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.500]  So I think that the kind of thing that they would use may be more akin to a macbook
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.180]  But I do keep coming back to the I was thinking about the microsoft. Um
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:15.060]  Surface laptop, uh surface notebook. I forget what it's called, but it's the one that's a pure laptop
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.700]  It's not a not a tablet or a convertible. It's the laptop and they got that to start at 999
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.620]  Yeah, and it looks very much like a macbook air. But how did they do it? It is this
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.020]  uh to take a word from the
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.340]  The car world it's decontenting where it's just like its specs are terrible
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:37.460]  But it starts at 999 and I do have that question sometimes of like would apple in the tim cook era
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:44.100]  Do something that apple kind of has shied away from in the past which is to make an entry-level system where the specs are really not
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.860]  Very good apple tends to sort of say no no below here
[01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.980]  we're not going to even go because it's not a good enough experience, but
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:56.820]  It would be one way to get those laptops down under a thousand because that's what microsoft did and like you look at that
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040]  999 surface laptop
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:02.980]  And you don't want it you like you don't want that model you want one
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:09.240]  That's a couple hundred dollars more, but they can say that it starts at 999 and that's important for you know, buying psychology
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:13.540]  But I do fear like all the schools that are like, yeah, that's great. We're gonna get that laptop
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:19.380]  It's like no you don't want that laptop if schools are even buying surface laptops. They probably aren't they're probably just buying chromebooks
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.620]  I think you're talking about the surface book
[01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:27.540]  Surface book. That's it. Yeah, the one it's it's not the one where it like has the weird bendy hinge
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.660]  It's the one that's just a macbook air. It's a it's just a
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.300]  microsoft macbook air
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:39.460]  Yeah, I think but I know what you mean and to some extent apple has clearly already been doing that by continuing to sell this
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.860]  MacBook air the macbook air when you go in and say I want the 999 macbook air
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.440]  You're not just getting a non-retina screen, which is really
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:52.300]  It in my opinion embarrassing in 2018, but it only has eight
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:56.740]  Gigabytes of RAM it you can't even build the order to get more RAM
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:02.040]  Literally the macbook air every macbook air gets eight gigs of RAM and you'll like it
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:08.160]  and the default one only has 128 gigabytes of SSD storage, which I think is I
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.940]  Mean, it's not terrible
[01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:16.380]  I know that the way that SSD doubles in these powers of two that going from 64 to
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:22.780]  128 got got got them over the hump of being usable for people as their main computer
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.940]  But 128 is pretty bad today like here
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:30.060]  But I wouldn't be surprised that I wouldn't be surprised to see night to hit that
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:37.060]  999 mark if the new one, you know comes out and still is at 128 for that 999 config and so real-time follow-up
[01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.700]  It's the surface laptop
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.840]  Okay surface laptop and it's the one that's got the kind of fabric cover on it
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.700]  Oh, yeah, it's a laptop and it looks kind of like a macbook air and it actually starts at 799
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.300]  But again, that is not a configuration that you would want
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:55.020]  so I do think about that sometimes like would Apple do that and like literally like
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.780]  One of the ways you get down under a thousand isn't by inventing a whole brand new computer that is made with cheaper
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:07.540]  Technology, although they could do that one way to get down there is to do something that they're very good at actually which is
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:15.580]  You know you make a base configuration and then all of the upgrades are kind of pricey so that the average selling price of a
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.740]  laptop is
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.180]  Still pretty high even though they now have something that's 999
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.180]  Right and figure out a way to make it so that
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.460]  Anybody could at least you know, most people could at least see oh, yeah
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:32.060]  Maybe I do want to spend a little bit more right to get your point
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:37.060]  It would be a hard the as currently designed the macbook escape kind of can't go down there
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:42.100]  So they one possibility is that the macbook escape gets kind of like redesigned into something that's cheaper
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.300]  But like I said earlier
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:51.100]  I think I think it maybe is more likely that there's just a new model that doesn't have all the great stuff in it
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:57.100]  And it's not you know that Apple was a little I think that this is the truth of the of the macbook and of the retina
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:01.300]  Macbooks in general with this generation is Apple was a little too
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:08.900]  Aggressive with pushing the new expensive tech thinking people would really love it and they don't
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:15.580]  Love love it and it's more expensive than they thought and that has made this like space beneath
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:22.180]  So maybe there's yeah, maybe there's something that's just little not as nice, but still a Mac still a good laptop and
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.920]  Something that is gonna appeals all those people who are I mean because let's be honest here
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.480]  There are people still buying MacBook Airs in 2018 at $9.99
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.680]  Right now today it is the best-selling Mac that they make I don't know this for a fact
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:41.000]  But I'm convinced sure feels like it right with with the exception of like when there's pent-up demand for a brand new model
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.160]  I think in general over the over the long haul
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:48.560]  I think you're probably right and and so I don't think there's an argument to be made that said oh people aren't gonna want to
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.560]  Buy a laptop. That's that's made with cheaper substandard materials than the stuff that's available and up. They're doing it now
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.120]  It's like a three-year-old Intel processor in there
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:04.440]  And a non retina display and those big bezels and and yeah some features
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.360]  We like like that keyboard and the mag safe
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.800]  but like that the people who are buying the air are not gonna get turned away because
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:17.640]  It's not as nice as the pro there. It's not that's not gonna be an issue, right?
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:24.920]  I I totally agree. I think anybody I don't think anybody I just think we've gotten to the point where for most people a
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.800]  Three-year-old CPU in the in the MacBook Air is not a problem
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.520]  They don't even care their eyes just glaze over if you told them if you just mention to them the better
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:41.240]  CPU in the MacBook Pro their eyes just glaze over and even the things that they might understand the easiest like the
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.880]  The gigahertz clock speeds are very close, you know, like the advantage to the you know
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.400]  The pro is that it has more cores. It doesn't even sound that much faster like
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.880]  People who listen to this show and you and I might know that it is actually a lot faster
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.120]  But real people don't see it and they're not doing anything where they're hitting the CPU anyway
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.840]  And the only thing if they gave any crap about games
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.280]  They may not even be buying a Mac like laptop in the first place and they certainly wouldn't be looking at the MacBook Air
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.920]  So in terms of the GPU as long as it plays full-screen video
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.160]  That's what else do they do? That is graphically intensive right and everything plays full-screen video just fine now
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.240]  Yeah, it's it's true. That's the thing is so I think Apple could really cheap out on
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:33.320]  Cp. Yeah GPU. I don't think certainly like the MacBook, right? They could use the they don't call it core M anymore
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.240]  but it's a cheap i3 or i5 and
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:43.960]  The and maybe slower SSD and I mean and they could do if they wanted they could just do USB C and not Thunderbolt
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:51.000]  They could do that if they wanted to like they've got lots of options to make something that's still gonna be just fine for most people
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:58.680]  What if they came out with a new quote-unquote MacBook Air and I had a retina screen and it like geek bench slower than
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920]  than the old MacBook Air
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:07.720]  There's a certain contingent of people who know what geek benches whose heads would explode but I wouldn't put it past them
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.540]  You know, like they've switched to the core M or something like that
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.360]  Well, I remember like the first what was it?
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.240]  It was at the MacBook Air like when the first MacBook Air came out and keeping in mind as you pointed out in your article
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.240]  It was super expensive
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.040]  $1,800. Yeah. Yeah, and I tested that and then let's leaving aside also the fact that if it got too hot like
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.840]  on a warm day in in in a warm room
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.460]  It would it had this bug where we just turn off a processor core and your mouse would stop moving
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.600]  smoothly
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.080]  It was so bad like it was great in a meat locker
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.160]  But really really bad in my office that way that had a west-facing window in the afternoon
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.920]  It was it worked great in the morning in the afternoon. Not so good
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.760]  That thing when it came out it was I forget it was slower
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:59.120]  it was it was several years into the Intel transition and it was slower than any it was the slowest Intel Mac ever made and
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:03.840]  It was like years in yeah, like it was like we're the two or three years into the Intel transition
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.720]  I don't remember the exact time but it was like it was a
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.960]  Throwback in terms of performance. It was it was not close to being as
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.800]  Fast as the slowest Mac from two years before right?
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.320]  But you know what it had other things going for it in in not price at that point, but size and so something
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:30.080]  Something that's a regression in terms of speed at this point. Like does it matter like for most uses now?
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.480]  That that's the truth of all of this stuff is that if you're a pro you need pro stuff
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.240]  But everybody else just they don't they really don't yeah
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.240]  That that original MacBook Air was such a glimpse of the future though
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.440]  And the eighteen hundred eighteen hundred dollar version came with an 80 gigabyte spinning hard disk. Yeah
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.400]  You could upgrade for like two grand. You could get an SSD in there and it was only 64 gigabytes
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.720]  And so it was like thirty one hundred thirty one hundred dollars
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.840]  It was like a thirty one hundred dollar laptop had a 64 gigabyte SSD, but I remember
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.000]  It was will Shipley
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.880]  I don't know if he was blogging or if maybe Twitter was around because it probably was around 2008
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:12.640]  So it might have been on Twitter and Shipley bought one. He's a developer at delicious monster and
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.680]  You know Mac developer a longtime Mac developer will Shipley was tweeting about it and he loved it and he was like look
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:24.600]  I know that the processor slow but like he was doing things in Xcode that were actually faster
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.240]  Even though the processor was two years slower
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.520]  It was faster in Xcode because what he was doing was touching lots of little files
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.920]  And that's the sort of thing SSDs just below a spinning hard disk away and it was actually seeing performance gains
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.280]  And obviously that's an edge case, you know
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:48.960]  But it was a hint of the future and one reason that our computers today feel so much faster than old computers
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:55.320]  Is is the tremendous advantage? I mean, it's so easy to overlook SSDs now that we're all used to them
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:01.120]  But I mean storage was always I mean slow hard drive even in the days where there weren't SSDs
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.360]  If you had a slow hard drive slow spinning hard drive, it was almost always the hard drive
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:11.380]  That was the problem all processors were so fast have been so fast for so long that almost every regular use
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.720]  The hard it was like your hard drive. I
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:20.680]  Upgraded an old Mac laptop a year or so ago to an SSD and it's just it's laughable like it suddenly
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:28.160]  It's like you don't need a new computer use this five-year-old computer with an SSD. It's great. Like it is it is staggering
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.280]  I looked it up by the way new MacBook Air our original MacBook Air came out January 2008
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:39.520]  I believe the first Intel Mac came out in January 2006. Hmm, and that MacBook Air was slower than any of those
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.600]  To maybe roll the Intel Macs. Yeah, that's unbelievable
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.240]  The other thing dude was looking back on it going down memory lane is the way that spinning hard disks when you at least in a
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.400]  Laptop, especially because you couldn't hide it under your desk
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:58.960]  Gave your computer a noise and and a feeling on your palms. Like you could feel it when the computer was reading
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:05.080]  Or if they spun down to save power and then at the disk and you could you could actually hear it and
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.320]  Yeah
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.720]  The non SSD version that was like an iPod hard drive
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.800]  So it was like not even us. It was a super small hard drive. So it was
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.120]  Just incredibly slow, right? It was not it was not a good
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.360]  I'm looking at the Mac Macworld speed mark score now, which is like all the reference systems
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.360]  Were like 170 160 and the MacBook Air
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:37.440]  Scored 124. It's just like it was not it was it was faster than the PowerBook g4
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:42.600]  That was what we decided it was all we could do remember to that in the spinning hard disk era
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:50.240]  They were also far less reliable like by probably by several orders of magnitude and I mean
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.960]  Everybody was old enough and it was into computers at the in the spinning hard disk era
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.560]  We'll remember this that you'd get used to the way your computer sounded quickly like and you bought a new computer
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:05.240]  It would be a new different hard drive. Maybe a different enclosure, you know as the years went on computer sounded different
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.080]  But they all had a sound and if the hard drive started making a different sound
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.520]  You
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.520]  would immediately
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.560]  like bolt up from your chair and run and get like a disc warrior CD or
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:25.040]  Some kind of disc utility because you knew that shit was gonna go bad very quickly like you can actually diagnose a slight
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:32.580]  Change in the hum of the drive and you're like, oh no that that is that's yeah, they're bad spinning drives
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.800]  They serve us well
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:41.720]  They still serve us well in some places but boy that that is I'm so glad that that technology is out of most of the devices
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:48.520]  I use you could diagnose a computer or at least know something was wrong from mechanical noises that it made. It's like it's like
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.960]  mystical
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.120]  magical
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:57.620]  Wizard stuff right where it was literally like this can't be real. It's like using leeches on a patient or something
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:02.400]  It's like this can't be you're just listening to my computer and now now you're feeling the vibrations in my computer
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.400]  That can't be right, but it actually was it was totally real
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.120]  Terrible terrible what we're saying is listen to us old people
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.060]  Warn you of how bad things were back in the day. We got a good now
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.640]  We were good this trip down memory lane seems like a good place to end it
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.760]  We're thinking about something bad spinning our discs. Let's talk about something good and it's our next sponsor good friends at trace
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.520]  Pontas
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  Trace Pontas is a
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.400]  You look you've heard of single origin coffee, this is single farm coffee. It is a farm
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.080]  down in Brazil owned by a single family and
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:45.320]  They make one type of coffee and this is fantastic that it because it's a complete opposite of my how to buy a keyboard thing
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.880]  They've got one type of coffee. It's from the same farm
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.180]  They've owned it for generations and they've only recently started selling it outside of Brazil
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:59.940]  And what you choose from is how you want it roasted. They've got one one type of coffee
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.300]  Big farm down in Brazil and they've got light medium dark and French Ross
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:09.620]  I like I go between I got have a bunch of it and I've been drinking it for months
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.980]  I like the light in the medium and sort of maybe what I should do is like make a half-and-half
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:20.260]  I can't decide I'm not really a dark roast person. But if you are they've got you covered with their dark and French Ross
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.380]  You could buy a couple bags and decide, you know
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.740]  which one you like best you can get it pre ground or you could do what I think is the right thing and
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.700]  Get the unground coffee and buy a nice little grinder and do it fresh right when you brew your own coffee
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:40.060]  It's a great coffee and they have this other thing in addition to the fact that you can just go and buy coffee and be
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.060]  Done with it right now. They've got
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.460]  subscriptions and
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:49.420]  Subscription coffee is absolutely amazing because then you just never have to worry about it
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.740]  Just you just figure out how often you need a bag of coffee
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:55.380]  You can get it like weekly every two weeks every month, whatever you need
[01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:01.100]  and then it just shows up from the Postal Service and every two weeks, you've got fresh coffee and
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.740]  Part of this is the convenience
[01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.540]  you're never out of coffee and
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:11.440]  Part of it is that they really go to great lengths to make sure that the coffee you get is fresh
[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.180]  like it doesn't go from
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:18.940]  Trace Pontas to some warehouse and then it sits on the shelf in a warehouse and then somebody picks it off and sends it
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.860]  To you trace Pontas does the shipping themselves and they're only shipping fresh fruit freshly roasted coffee all the time
[01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:31.680]  And I'm telling you coffee is Marco backed me up on it two weeks ago, but coffee is is is like a grocery
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:38.640]  It's like something from the the vegetable aisle in the groceries. It it goes bad quickly or at least goes bland quickly
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:39.980]  It's not like it goes rotten
[01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:46.900]  But it really it really is something like a perishable item fresh coffee tastes so much better it once you get used to it
[01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.900]  You can't go back
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:55.020]  And I will say this they have two great ways to buy their coffee. You can go to their website trace tres
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.140]  Pontas PON TAS comm
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:02.980]  Go right there. You see their whole story see the details you can order from them
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:08.100]  But it's even easier if you buy trace Pontas coffee fresh on Amazon
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.060]  Let's go to Amazon and search for trace Pontas
[01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:18.380]  It'll be the first thing you see and when you buy on Amazon Amazon is just acting as the the e-commerce thing
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:22.540]  For the transaction the order still gets fulfilled by trace Pontas
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:29.300]  It's fulfilled the exact same people as back same place the exact same fresh coffee as if you ordered from trace Pontas themselves
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:35.300]  They're the ones encouraging you to go to Amazon and do it there if you want because they they want it to be as convenient
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.860]  as possible
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:44.180]  You know, they're the ones encouraging me to tell you about buying it on Amazon and and double enforcing that you get the exact same
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:46.180]  shipment from the exact same place
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.460]  and
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:52.220]  There's even more good stuff all orders in the u.s
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.180]  Either from trace Pontas or from Amazon enjoy free shipping. I don't even know how that's possible
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.940]  That seems too good to be true, but it is true. So
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:06.660]  Go to trace Pontas. If you've never had their coffee before buy some try it out
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:09.980]  See if you like it and once you have it and you like it go back
[01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:13.580]  Get a subscription and get your beans every one two or four weeks your choice
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.900]  And here's the extra deal when you get a subscription
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:24.560]  You pay 10% less per bag than you would buying at a bag at a time and listeners of the talk show get an extra
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.580]  10% off keep this to yourselves, but it's it's a bit of a secret
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:34.960]  Extra 10% off just by using the code the talk show at checkout when you buy a coffee subscription
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:41.180]  So that means you get a total of 20% off every bag just for learning about trace point us from from this show
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:47.860]  You got to enter that code at checkout to get that deal. So my thanks to trace Pontas for their continuing support of
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.540]  the talk show
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:57.660]  I want to mention I want to mention that Apple has some experience in this making something a lot like
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:03.500]  the bigger product but making it cheaper like and and look no further than the iPad lineup and
[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:11.020]  Again, that's sort of what is biased me towards the they should have a just plain whatever and then one called the pro
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.020]  You know like iPad and iPad Pro
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.940]  although that ignores the
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:18.340]  iPad mini which is still hanging around
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.220]  But
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:25.520]  The iPad is now down to three hundred twenty nine dollars and it's a pretty, you know
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:28.100]  There's obviously some compromises compared to the iPad Pro
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.500]  But you know, they've added things like the pencil pencil support it's a pretty good computer and so yes
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.780]  There's compromises but none that are you know?
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.640]  Like oh, this is a bad machine. This is actually a wonderful iPad for most people
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:50.240]  No, it's a good I think that is the like the flawless example of them getting their house in order because the iPad line was
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.760]  kind of a mess and
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.320]  they did some really smart things in terms of kind of breaking off the
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:01.940]  One iPad and letting it kind of move down in price and then that also freed them to make the iPad Pro
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.660]  Which I use every day more powerful because they're like the people who the people who care about this stuff
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:13.200]  They will but they will spend a thousand dollars on an iPad Pro and it's great and everybody else can just get the iPad and they're
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200]  Gonna be very happy and it's the right
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:21.400]  Mixture like that that should be how I think the laptop line should be very similar, right?
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.600]  You should you should have the ones that are super powerful
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:28.480]  And then you should have the ones that everybody else is gonna be very happy with they're not not crappy
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.440]  They're not last year's or two years ago's model
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:39.440]  they're just enough for for people to have a really good experience who don't need all the all the fancy bells and whistles because
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:46.400]  those people will be happy to spend more money on getting the like me like the MacBook the MacBook Pro the Mac iMac Pro
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.880]  And the iPad Pro like if you want one of those you spend the money
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.160]  That's totally worth it because you know what you're getting and everybody else
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.980]  Gets that iPad that iPad is great and its price is amazing
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:02.060]  Given where Apple's iPad pricing has been and I think people like it
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:08.180]  I think that the sales have shown that that that is a strategy that really works now having the two different lines of iPad
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.060]  Yeah, and it works for Apple
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:16.340]  It's it's stabilized at least iPad sales if not increase them slightly, but it's leveled off the decline
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:19.980]  You know, it's good for Apple because the iPad is selling
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:20.140]  well
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.900]  it is good for consumers because I feel like there's an iPad for everyone and
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:31.340]  They understand it too. It is easily understood what the differences are like you can look at an iPad and
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:35.200]  You know, I you know, I remember, you know
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.700]  being in college and
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:41.780]  Knowing where I always there. I know exactly where on Drexel's campus
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:44.700]  There was the ATM machine that would like you'd let you take out $10 bills
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.620]  So that if I had $17 left in my checking account
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:55.780]  I could still get some cash like I know what it's like to be strapped for cash so I can also imagine and at the
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:59.060]  You know as even then a technology enthusiast I could see
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:04.420]  Craving an iPad Pro and having to settle for the iPad for budgetary processes
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:10.140]  but you know purposes, but I also think that there's an awful lot of people who would go in and you know
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:16.140]  could if they wanted to afford a more expensive iPad, but look at the iPad and are
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:22.540]  Informed of the differences and don't care about the differences and just get the regular iPad, you know, yeah
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:27.180]  That's the way to do it. That's and it makes sense right before it was sort of like well
[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:33.260]  You know, which iPad do I want? So now it's I think it's pretty clear like these have this pay pay more
[01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:38.620]  These don't pay less and it's like alright great and they even the size like because that first iPad Pro
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:42.460]  Well, the first was the 12 9 but then they did the 9.7 and it was like, okay
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.420]  wait a second now you've got like an iPad air 2 and an iPad Pro 9.7 and
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:52.100]  So they're exactly the same and so the next rev they're like no, it's 10.5 screen
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:56.020]  Now we've they're pushing it and I think this fall will probably see them push even further
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:24:01.900]  Away with what makes an iPad Pro and iPad Pro and that's like that level of clarity
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.640]  I think is really good for a product line
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.060]  Which is why it's been so frustrating to look at the MacBook line and be like what is happening?
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.280]  What are you guys doing there? And I think Apple I mean what I feel bad is like
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.820]  Apple the people inside Apple know like they know they knew this was a problem way before we did probably
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:22.680]  But they know that it just is gonna take they probably would there was like two years where they're like
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.120]  Yeah, we're gonna have to take our lumps for two years while we sort this one out
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.920]  And maybe they'll reach the end of the line. Maybe they'll finally get something that makes sense this fall
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.900]  I hope so a very slow-moving ship to turn around I think yeah, I think so
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:40.300]  I think the other kudo that they deserve for the current lineup of iPads is that the both iPad pros the
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.980]  10.5 and the 12.9 are a bit long in the tooth
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:50.020]  They're certainly more each more than a year old and nobody and you know people expect based on just you know
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:54.580]  Sticking your finger in the air and thinking well, it seems like they should be new one soon and based on the rumor
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:57.160]  You know, there are rumors that there's ones coming out with
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.740]  Significantly shrunk bezels, you know, everything is smaller bezels these days
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:06.620]  But there's nobody's really like up in arms like boy. These are these are outdated, right?
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:12.180]  Like they did such a good job with the current available iPad pros that they were
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.940]  They could last for well longer than a 12-month cycle
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.940]  And be completely credible as as still being good purchases today
[01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:28.300]  I'm still using my iPad pro that I bought in December of was that 15 the original
[01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:35.980]  12 9 iPad pro is still my mobile device of choice basically, and it's great. Yeah, it doesn't have the
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:43.460]  True-tone doesn't have the wide color gamut, but it's not not as good a processor, but it's still great
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:49.380]  It's still legitimately great and I'm going to buy a new one this fall, but I will have gotten three years out of that thing
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:54.180]  Yeah, it's not without any any moaning and complaining about it's still pretty great. Yeah
[01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:56.180]  So
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.860]  Back to the MacBooks. I
[01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:02.140]  Still I don't know. I I
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.220]  Don't think there I think the bottom line is that they're not going to completely get out of this
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.700]  mess this year mess being a lineup that offers
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:16.460]  Significant clarity because I don't you know, I don't even rumors aside
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.520]  I don't think they're gonna get rid of the 12-inch MacBook
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:23.280]  But I don't think the 12-inch MacBook can serve as their low-end model, even if they could sell it for $9.99
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  I don't think that would be a good idea
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:31.540]  And so I think they do need something else whether that's the MacBook escape with a new name or
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:37.620]  You know and maybe and maybe engineered to be made out of cheaper bits or something. I don't know
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.260]  Or whether it's that new thing. I think it's got to be one of those two because I think you're right
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:46.340]  I don't think they could just take the MacBook make it $9.99 and say see buy it now
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:52.180]  I'm not I think people would be a little resistant because it's unless unless they do some upgrades to it
[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.340]  Which would probably preclude it being $9.99
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:59.700]  It's gonna have the one port and it's small and it's got a small screen and that's gonna turn a lot of people off
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:02.740]  So it doesn't seem to be the right vehicle to do
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.360]  It might be the right vehicle to get to $9.99
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:11.180]  They could probably do that but it the air isn't just succeeding because it's $9.99
[01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:17.620]  Yeah, maybe it's as simple as just effectively taking the MacBook escape and
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:23.580]  And given an extra what it almost two years, right?
[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:29.940]  I think that that those came out in 2016. I forget if there was a speed bump, but the original ones were 2016
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:36.620]  And just being able to put what that is today into a wedge shape case
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:43.980]  That's more like the air right? Yeah, and then that separates because that wedge the difference between what would you call the MacBook Pro?
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:51.260]  It's like is that rectilinear the way that it doesn't have any kind of wedge or teardrop shape to it. Yeah, it's just a yeah
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:57.220]  It's just a yeah, it's a rectangle. Yeah extruded. It's just it is just a shape. It's not doesn't have a weird shape
[01:27:57.220 --> 01:27:58.700]  it's just kind of a
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:04.980]  Blob and yeah, the air had that that kind of wedge and was a little curvier. All right, if they just took them
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.500]  effectively just took the
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:11.100]  MacBook escape put it in a wedge-shaped aluminum case
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.140]  And because maybe you know they could do this or that
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:20.580]  To you know reduce the amount of battery and whatever else was in there without affecting battery life with two years of advances in
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:23.160]  Power efficiency and there you go
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.980]  And then it's visually distinctive from the MacBook Pros in addition to which name is stamped underneath the display
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.820]  Because oh I see it's teardrop shape. That's more like the air. I
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:35.740]  also think there's I
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:43.220]  Mean there's an argument to be made Marco talked about this quite a lot when he was buying and returning his MacBook escape
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.220]  Or escapes. I think it might have done it more than once is that
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:51.140]  technically the part the processor that's in the
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.700]  Escape is the successor to the processor that's in the air, right?
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:29:01.180]  so like and if you look at the weight, this is one of my favorite things is look at the weight and
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:08.580]  The size of the 13-inch MacBook escape compared to the 13-inch MacBook Air. They are practically the same
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.100]  They're not quite there
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:14.880]  It is that MacBook escape with weird name where it's like there's two 13 MacBook Pros
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.660]  like it's hard for me not to think that they really
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:23.460]  intended that for it to be a MacBook and then they realized that they had to sell it for $15.99 and
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:30.820]  They couldn't call it a MacBook. They had to call it a MacBook Pro, but I do wonder I do wonder if their way
[01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:32.820]  I think it's a scenario just
[01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:36.620]  Spitballing here that they find a way to get that thing
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:43.700]  To be not quite as nice and not quite as advanced but enough to shove it down in the product line
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:50.260]  To have it be kind of down there with the MacBook and not and ideally by the way, just purely on semantics
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:55.620]  I know that you and I like to talk about how products get named and product lines get formed like that thing
[01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:01.500]  We do not need 13 inch MacBook Pro with touch bar and right out touch bar
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:06.060]  Right, like that needs to stop that map quick escape. It's a cute nickname
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.660]  But like it needs a real name that is not the name of another computer currently being sold. That's gotta stop
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.200]  I try to avoid using nicknames
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:16.980]  not not out of
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:23.740]  Allegiance to Apple's marketing whims. I mean because for example, I refused to like spell Mac OS with a lowercase M
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:29.060]  Mac mini with a lowercase M or anything like that. So it's not out of that
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:33.220]  It's just that I don't want I I find it. It can be a little bit disdainful
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:37.980]  You know that it's it's not like I feel like you have to do what Apple says, but I feel like it's shameful
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:43.260]  But I actually feel like the MacBook escape thing is so much more clear like people know what that is
[01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:45.980]  And when you do the mouthful 13 inch MacBook Pro
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.660]  without
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.460]  Touch bar it is like you have to stop and think it's like a double negative almost, you know
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.980]  I mean the name includes something that it doesn't have
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:03.220]  It's the thing that it doesn't have there are lots of things that that computer doesn't have it doesn't have you know a
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:12.060]  Spinning wheel. It doesn't have a USB a port. It doesn't have there, you know a floppy drive. It doesn't there's lots of things
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:17.100]  It doesn't have including the touch bar which is in its name that it doesn't have it
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.260]  Like it's just I agree with you
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:25.220]  Also, there's a communication thing like you reach a lot of people who are not tuned in to what's happening on Marco's podcast
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:29.480]  or you know other places in the Apple kind of blogosphere and so
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:31.220]  These names are cute
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.140]  like Marco always called the MacBook the 12-inch MacBook the MacBook one right and I kind of like that as a
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:40.780]  Little bit of a needle to Apple for like there's only the one port on it
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:46.200]  But if you if you use that name people are gonna be like, I don't get it. What are you talking about?
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:52.140]  That's a perfect example of a nickname that I either avoid it or mostly avoid it. That's a perfect example
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.980]  I just call it the 12-inch MacBook and leave it at that
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:59.180]  That that is that that you can gain some clarity on for people but the MacBook escape
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:04.220]  Like not only is it kind of a great name makes me think of like it's a journey album. It's weird
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.300]  Like it's a throwback. It's like why why is this happening? Is it trying to escape? We don't know
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:13.020]  But it needs a name because basically Apple didn't give it a name
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:18.260]  They just said that it's not the other one and I hope I hope it because it's actually a pretty great computer
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.260]  I hope it kind of escapes the
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.300]  See what I did there
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:27.860]  escapes the MacBook Pro name and get some other name because it really doesn't it deserve to be
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.100]  My I do wonder though
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.240]  If maybe it just we haven't seen the likes of it
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:39.480]  Or we've seen the last of it that what we're gonna get is like a reconstituted Mac MacBook escape. That's something else. I
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.560]  Another thing I'm gonna promise to put this in the show notes
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:46.600]  But somebody on Twitter today in the midst of all this conversation about this. I
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:54.240]  Remembered it. I remembered it the this bit from Phil Schiller at the debut of the current generation of MacBook Pros
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:56.240]  and
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:03.280]  basically, he's making the point that the 13-inch Mac new MacBook Pro is roughly the same size and weight as the
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.800]  MacBook Air. Yeah
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:11.480]  But somebody linked to that part of the video like and had they even you know use the little
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:16.720]  code on YouTube to start right right at the point where he's talking about it and it's actually it's you know
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.000]  It's Phil Schiller at his best and Apple at their best at making
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.200]  Some points that it might be a bit delicate to make like here you've introduced
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:32.440]  you've spent all this time bragging about the touch bar this new invention that they're very proud of and that it is
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.800]  expensive and that they want people to be excited about
[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:40.720]  I'll link to the video because I don't want to summarize the whole thing because it's really so good
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.080]  But he makes the point that hey, we still love the MacBook Air. We're still selling the MacBook Air. That's fine
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:52.320]  We know people like it, but we challenged the team and that's like a phrase that often comes up with Apple, right?
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.240]  But it you know, it means this was tricky
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:34:00.680]  but we challenged the team to maybe do a version with this MacBook Pro that might be tempting for people looking at the MacBook Air and
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:04.000]  It has the function keys that you're used to
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.960]  and
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.760]  You know starting price that was lower, you know, I forget what is the starting price 1299
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.280]  I forget if it was then 1299 it was not that was something that yeah
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.800]  They cut it by a couple hundred which is interesting, right?
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.080]  Yes, because right away from the pros even more right if it was
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:28.360]  1499 in November of 2016 and then dropped to 1299 a year later
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:34.220]  Could it drop another $200 now and maybe even with you know, like a thinner case or something?
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.720]  But anyway, he made the point that the footprint is smaller because they reduce the bezels
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:45.120]  But it's still a thirteen point three inch diagonal. So if the bezels are reduced, then the footprint has to be reduced
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.880]  And by volume it was like 13% smaller
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.640]  Even though it doesn't have the wedge shape because of the footprint smaller. It actually does it they showed a little video of a
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:01.680]  13-inch MacBook Pro on top of a MacBook Air, you know
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.500]  Just lids closed and you could see how much smaller it is by surface area on the footprint
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:13.500]  And that the weight was exactly the same. I mean, it's literally I mean, it's not quite exactly it's one ounce difference
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:19.160]  It's like, you know, like two business cards on top of a MacBook Air and you've got the same weight as the 13-inch
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:25.860]  MacBook escape so the weight is exactly the same three point zero pounds footprint smaller volume is smaller
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:30.700]  so if they could make that volume even smaller, that would really be a you know, a
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:33.820]  You know in some ways
[01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:38.180]  Ignoring the 12-inch MacBook. It would be a nice successor to the MacBook Air as we know it
[01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:44.940]  Yeah, it is essentially that's the thing that I think gets lost in the naming is that it is that it's the same processor
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:50.380]  The price doesn't not the same price not the same name, but same processor class same weight
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:55.160]  Same size essentially functionally the same size because although it doesn't have the wedge
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:01.540]  It's I think it's you know, other dimensions have contracted and like it's a it's a great laptop
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:06.420]  I think I think the big problem with it was the yeah, it was introduced at way too high price and they obviously did made
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:09.420]  Some effort to get it down in price a couple hundred bucks. So now it's
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.300]  It's basically the same price as the MacBook
[01:36:14.860 --> 01:36:19.040]  One of these days I want to hear I gotta tell you one of these days I really want to hear what happened
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:25.100]  So clearly like something went wrong and I don't know what but like they totally didn't plan it this way
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:29.940]  They didn't plan to be selling the MacBook Air in 2018, right? Like there's no way
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:35.660]  And they don't nobody at Apple. So I got a great idea. Let's sell two different 13-inch MacBook Pros, right?
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:37.620]  That'll be great. People will love that
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:37.940]  No
[01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:44.740]  They had to because something went wrong and one day maybe we'll find out what what happened that surprised them that they
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:49.680]  That I couldn't do it. Yeah, one thing Apple really cares about is the way their things look
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.700]  I mean and a lot of times when they'll cheap out on things
[01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:58.180]  It's not by making them look worse and look at the iPad versus iPad Pro, right?
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:02.820]  It's it it's a great looking tablet. It's still made of an aluminum back
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:09.820]  Yeah, it's not not cheap plastic or anything like that. And so it's like I don't think that the the iPad has true tone
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:15.660]  Right. It's no way that 329 iPad has true tone. I could be wrong. I don't think it
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:17.340]  I think that's one of the ways that it's less expensive
[01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:20.380]  But that's that's like nice to have and I do love true tone
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:24.340]  But it's you know, but having a non retina display looks bad
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:30.960]  I mean it really is, you know, you just look right at it. It looks ridiculous in to my eyes today
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:32.620]  And they know it
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:37.620]  I think they're about they have to be embarrassed by it then but nobody at Apple is happy that they're still selling it in
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:44.100]  2018 and it's so unfortunate really really is that the timing on this, you know
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.220]  I think the other one of those other backstories is I think whatever is going on behind the scenes that
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.140]  Whatever MacBooks they might be announcing later this year
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:59.220]  I think they had really hoped to have announced earlier this year because anybody who got a laptop for back-to-school is getting it
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:02.700]  You know got a 13 inch MacBook Air with a non retina screen
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:08.600]  I had so many people ask me this summer because I wrote a piece last summer about what laptop you should buy
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:13.380]  Yeah, and this summer they're all like, oh, yeah, what what's the update to that? So quite frankly, there isn't one
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:16.740]  And that was like people were getting gifts for graduates
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:23.180]  Yeah, and I said I got nothing and then WWDC happened and it's like I still don't have anything and a month goes by
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:27.100]  And there they update the pros but only the pros not even the escape
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:32.060]  And so now we're at the point where everybody's going, you know college students are back in school
[01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.180]  My kids are back in school
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:40.320]  Like that whole period is over and they completely missed it and you gotta think they would have rather not missed it
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:45.020]  So that's that's another part of this story. Like I feel I feel for them on the same
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:48.660]  They obviously made some bad calls. They obviously made some calls that turned out to be wrong
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:55.340]  I feel bad for the people involved because like when you make that mistake, then you got to live with it for years
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:59.900]  What before it really can get resolved and that you know?
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.860]  That's why I keep coming back to I hope they resolve it
[01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.140]  Yeah, like I don't know if they're gonna be able to do it
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:09.020]  But like I saw what they did with the iPad where that was a mess and it took them a couple of years
[01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:13.960]  But now it makes sense and I hope that that happens with the with the consumer part of the MacBook line
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.800]  Yeah, I have to say while I'm on this
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.840]  I always want to mention this that one thing I've never recovered from and I've been using I
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120]  think I
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.400]  Think I went right from the 11-inch air to this
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.400]  13 inch MacBook Pro in 2014. I don't think there was anything in between
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:41.480]  One thing I've still so it's at least four years one thing. I still have never recovered from is when pulling it out of a bag
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.620]  using the wedge shape to orient it as I take it out and
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:53.180]  Knowing which way is front and which is back and I still have for four years when I take this one out
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:56.580]  It is like a 50-50 chance whether I'm gonna put it on the desk the right way
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:01.740]  And if anything, I've also got this weird totally old-school
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:08.060]  PowerBook user habit of orienting by looking at the Apple logo the wrong way
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:12.860]  Like one thing unless you're an old coot like us you will not remember and you'll think well
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:18.340]  Why in the world would they have done that is that for the first many years of power books?
[01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:22.020]  The Apple logo was oriented what you would now call upside down
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:28.780]  Such that the Apple logo looked correct when the laptop was closed in front of you the user
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:35.860]  Yes, and then when open and in use was upside down to anybody looking at your at you face on
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:42.940]  To what we now know is the proper way to do it, but and I it the funny thing, too
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:45.860]  I think I wrote about this on during fireball as an aside recently that
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:51.160]  There are still people who are very angry about that decision who want it to be the other way
[01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:58.060]  Because they they have a mindset that this is their computer and the Apple logo should look correct to them
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:02.980]  Which means that and I guess that was the thinking Apple originally had when they did it that way
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.580]  that
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:10.380]  You the user owner of this laptop should have the Apple logo look correct when it's closed in front of you
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.060]  And they feel that now that it's oriented the other way they see it the wrong way and their
[01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:24.080]  Their machine is acting as an advertisement for Apple by having it oriented the correct way for everybody looking at it now
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:28.980]  I disagree with that. I actually think it should look correct while it's being used not not correct
[01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:33.820]  Well, it's not being used but the downside of it is I still if I still sometimes look I think oh
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.720]  There's the Apple logo, and I put it down in front of me and the hinge is facing me
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:40.940]  Can I blow your mind with something
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:45.060]  I use my iPad almost entirely in horizontal orientation and
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:48.340]  The Apple logo is vertical
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:56.140]  All the time so I'm always using it sideways and it's a legacy of the iPhone being vertically oriented
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:59.380]  but like I really believe the iPad is a horizontal device and it's like
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.020]  Forget it unless they make like a swiveling Apple logo
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:10.220]  It's just like I don't I don't know something some use case is gonna be wrong. I guess is the the truth of it, but
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:11.980]  But yeah, I agree with you
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:17.820]  Although you know a cynical person would say they decided that the logo was to advertise it to others instead of it being for
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.980]  You to have that little moment, but I still think it was the right decision
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:25.620]  And if there's anything I miss when they changed the the laptops in the last couple of years
[01:42:25.620 --> 01:42:30.900]  It's that the Apple doesn't light up anymore because that was pretty amazing and you could never miss a Mac
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.700]  Laptop in a cafe when they lit up now
[01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:40.060]  It's a little bit easier to miss them well or like that that famous famous picture from around 10 years ago
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:46.460]  Of like a university lecture hall you know that with a very slope very high slope
[01:42:46.460 --> 01:42:48.460]  you know like stadium seating and
[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:53.920]  You know it's just some kind of undergraduate lecture hall and like a wide-angle view from the you know
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.260]  Professor's standpoint, and it was like every student had a laptop
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:02.960]  So it was it was sort of like a sign of the times in a couple of ways is like when you and I went
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.960]  To college nobody had laptops now
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.840]  and
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.360]  You know by ten years ago every student had a laptop they had him open
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:18.120]  That's what they did to take their notes and whatever else and it just just the number of them that had glowing Apple logos was
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:25.200]  Just staggering just as a sign of wow look at how Apple has taken over like the college student. You know portable market
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.720]  You just don't get that anymore without the glowing thing Marco
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:33.320]  And I talked about that and I guess I never I never did the research to figure this out
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.000]  I spout it off and said that
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:44.120]  That at some point originally the app may you but hopefully maybe you can know this I was gonna do research
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.120]  And I I didn't
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.080]  originally the Apple logo was
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:57.080]  Illuminated from the display so there all they had to do was just put a translucent piece of Apple
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.800]  logo shaped plastic back there and the display of
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:06.720]  The old LCDs or LEDs whatever they were called at the time just glowed in both directions and that modern
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.240]  LCDs
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:11.240]  Don't work that way that at some point
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.200]  You know they really only glow in one direction and that Apple had to put in a separate
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  thing to light up the Apple logo
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.440]  Interesting I had not heard that I don't know if that would be amazing if if they're if they had to cheat I
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:30.420]  Don't know I couldn't test it at the time because all I had was this new MacBook Pro
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:33.600]  That doesn't have a glowing Apple logo, and I said like in the old days
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:37.440]  I knew that when you change the brightness on the display it changed the brightness on the Apple logo
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:44.720]  and what people have written in to say is that that never changed the brightness control for the display always controlled the brightness color of
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:50.040]  The Apple logo even if I'm correct that they ended up having different lighting elements to make it work
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.260]  And it makes sense that it would because anywhere where you now that I think about it like if you're in
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.520]  You know using it in bed next to a sleeping partner
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.280]  And you want to have the brightness down low because the room is dark and your eyes don't need a bright screen
[01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:07.360]  And you don't want a bright screen to bother you know you're trying to sleep partner
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.020]  You wouldn't want the Apple logo growing glowing real bright either so of course
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:16.620]  They were just tied to the same brightness Center, but I do think though that I really do think it's true
[01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:19.400]  Even even though once again. I'm just pulling this out of my ass
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.200]  I really do think that at a certain point that when the screen technology changed
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.960]  They actually put in a separate lighting thing for the Apple logo
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.000]  It wouldn't surprise me and and it was a cool thing. It was a cool feature like
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.400]  On ATP it might have even been the same episode where your laptop got wet
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:40.000]  They were talking about whimsy and people misinterpret what whimsy means
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.100]  But I did hear that it is the whimsy is like
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:47.240]  I always viewed some of the stuff that Apple did as we did this because it was cool
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.000]  And we could do it right and it was not because it was practical
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.120]  But because we're Apple and we're gonna push a little bit further
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:59.080]  We're gonna make it cool so in the case of the cutout on the back that probably started with somebody saying oh my god
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:05.280]  Look at this we could we could like cut out the Apple logo, and it'll light up when it's in use that's amazing
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:09.280]  And then later they get a screen they're like oh no and somebody's like put in a light
[01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:12.120]  We have to keep the light up logo. They're like yeah, okay
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.600]  We'll do that or the the one that Marco brought up that I think is great is the the breathing sleep light
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  Yeah, which is like totally unnecessary
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.840]  But because when you look on PC laptops
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:27.380]  They would always have like hard drive access light and Wi-Fi light and all these things like forget that we'll put that on screen
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.000]  But when it's closed
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.880]  It's gonna do the slow pulse
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.520]  To let you know that it's there and that it's still alive and that it's in sleep mode and not shut down
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.160]  I'm like do they need to do that
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:42.840]  It totally didn't need to do that light on the light on the power charger right like they need to do it
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:47.880]  No, absolutely not, but it was a nice little bit, and I would you know I like that about Apple
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:52.500]  I like I like them having those little things that we do because it's cool because it makes you
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:59.240]  Appreciate how cool your product that you spent money on looks not necessarily this more cynical like how cool
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:05.400]  It makes you look, but like how make good it makes you feel that it does this thing that is pointless, but cool
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:11.120]  It's funny you brought that up because that was one of those points listening to ATP where I wish I could have jumped in
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.900]  Jumped in and started talking for anybody who doesn't remember for a long time
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:21.000]  Powerbooks even and MacBooks, but even in the aluminum era they figured out a way to do it through the aluminum
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.840]  they would have when your laptop was sleeping there was a
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:29.980]  Little light that would pulse on and off to indicate gently pulse right
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:33.100]  I didn't blink on and off it would slowly go on
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.700]  Slowly glow off and it was more or less timed to like the average breathing rate of a sleeping person
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.440]  It was a very soothing
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.960]  Rate and a very
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:47.000]  My nightlight for many years
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.960]  I would I would wake up in the middle of the night
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:56.200]  And I look at the ceiling and the ceiling would very slowly pulse brighter and then darker very subtly and I knew that was because
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.760]  My laptop was you know by the side of my bed and that light was just faintly illuminating the room
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:07.360]  So doing it with the pace tied to sleep like a very soothe, you know
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:13.600]  Like having a Bob Ross type soothing voice tell you to breathe slowly and you know, really help you relax
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.360]  You know that is whimsical and making sure that it didn't just blink on and off that it had like this nice
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.820]  You know curve to help right and then it's off, you know
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:30.460]  That's all whimsy by paying attention to stuff like that making the effort to get that to work through aluminum even you know
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.960]  When they couldn't just put a hole in the aluminum to make a light all of that is great
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:40.720]  But there was also a purpose to having it in the first place and I I do kind of miss it
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.720]  I wouldn't mind if they added that light back but
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:48.960]  I can kind of see why they got rid of it. But I what I remember specifically was that in the early years of
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.400]  Portable computers there wasn't sleep
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.160]  Your computer was on or off and when you were done using it you had to turn it off
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.120]  and
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.800]  You know, then they came out with sleep and you know, I'm I you might think I'm biased
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.280]  But I think this was I think this was undisputable at the time and you know
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.200]  Like in the mid 90s where power books the sleep was reliable and on PC
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:23.160]  Portables this sleep was a crapshoot whether it would actually wake up or still be asleep or whether it would crash while it was
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:30.000]  Supposedly sleeping like at a technical level Apple got sleep done right better years before
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.960]  Microsoft and the PC makers got it together
[01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.240]  but even then even when sleep was much more reliable on
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.440]  Power books than it was on the PC side. It was nowhere near as reliable as it is today
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.720]  I my opinion there were still times when you'd think your power book was
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.040]  sleeping and it either never went to sleep and like it was actually still like burning through the CPU or
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.960]  It would go to sleep and crash or something like that. So having that light glowing and knowing that your
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:05.440]  Your power book was still successfully, you know, and healthily sleeping was actually useful. It was a useful indicator to me at least
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:12.400]  Oh, yeah. Well, there was a really nasty bug where sometimes you'd close the lid and it would not go to sleep
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:17.360]  And I had that happen to me so many times where I would take my laptop
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:23.320]  I'd open my backpack at home having come on the bus from work and it was hot. I could tell like yeah
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.480]  Yeah hand toward I was like, oh no. Yes
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.640]  It'd you know run through its battery. It was still running lid closed. I opened it up
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:36.320]  The screen doesn't come back on I got force power it down like yeah, there were a few years there where sleep was
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.080]  Really really unreliable. I know that it still happens
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.680]  Especially when you run lid closed it can get really confused
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:48.320]  But like even when I did things like I would unhook I would open my laptop and unhook my external monitor
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.480]  Get it to be like, alright, are you good? You feel like a laptop now now?
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.960]  I'm gonna close you and it's still half the time. Yeah, it would not go to sleep
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.240]  You wouldn't get the little pulsating light frustrating
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.920]  Yeah, remember in the in the like Mac OS 9 era the with the Platinum user interface
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.080]  There was a user alert style with like a red top
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.240]  It was sort of a pink actually, but it was like it was like reserved for like really really bad alerts
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:11.080]  There was you know
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.580]  I think the you've only got 5% battery life was like one of those where it would come up
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:20.560]  and it was like the alert you didn't want to see if you if you had thought your
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:26.440]  Your machine was sleeping in your backpack for all this time and there were the other thing too again
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:30.840]  You know going down memory lane in addition to the fact that sleep is more reliable now
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:37.320]  When a machine died in sleep back then there were a lot of bad things that happened
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.800]  you know, like if you had files that were open they
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:43.560]  lost
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:48.320]  There's an awful lot of apps. I mean even wonderful wonderful apps like BB edit
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:52.460]  which has always been ahead of the curve on things like autosave and
[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:58.860]  Restoring and stuff like that. But you know, if you had like a BB edit a thing open and the machine died. It was like
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:01.780]  That there was a good chance you'd lose some of it
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:02.300]  Yeah
[01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:07.060]  They added a feature at one point in fact that I remember being really grateful for that was they built in their own
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:13.820]  Autosave that happened in the background even if it was in an untitled file, it would be saved somewhere. It's funny though, ironically
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:20.580]  The worst sleep failures I had were when Apple put in a new feature
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:27.060]  That was if the battery died it would yeah, and they still do this to this day
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:32.020]  It would write the contents of memory to disk right and then and and this is the deep sleep
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:33.520]  They do this not just when the battery dies
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:38.360]  but after it's been asleep for some period of time if you've ever had that you put your laptop to sleep and you come back
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.460]  The next day and it looks kind of like it's booting up
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:45.860]  But then it's just back and I didn't actually reboot that is loading
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:51.300]  They do a deep shutdown memory gets voided, but they've written the memory to disk and then they load the memory back in
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.540]  And then they pick up right where you left off. Well
[01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:56.140]  the early days of that feature
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:01.400]  Sometimes it would try to go to sleep and it would be like oh something terrible happened
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.860]  I'm dead and that would be it and wouldn't go to sleep and it would sit there and it would get hot and then you
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:10.620]  Have to reboot and you lost everything and eventually they got through it. But that was I really remember that
[01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:17.580]  I would do like command-line stuff where I'd be like do not try to page to disk because it will kill my laptop and
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:21.620]  Just turn that feature off for a couple of years while they while they get it settled
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:25.540]  I remember turning that off on a mission too, and it was also at a time when
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:34.580]  Storage sizes hadn't raced so far ahead of RAM sizes and it you could possibly be especially if you had like a machine
[01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:40.980]  Maxed out on RAM you you could run into a situation where there wasn't enough space on disk or it was so close that it
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:46.140]  Would fill up the disk to such a level that it would cause problems just by writing that file to oh, yeah to disk
[01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:52.500]  You know this all happens on some there's still some small drives even now on modern max where you can actually get a little bit
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:55.060]  of savings by turning that feature off and deleting your
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:54:02.420]  Your save your RAM save file and you're like, hey, I got another couple gigabytes back another good thing
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:06.740]  I just wrote about it today, but I literally published right before we started recording so I'll bet you haven't seen it
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:10.020]  But I can bring it I can just say what it is is. I wrote a short piece on
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.820]  inspired by a
[01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.660]  Mutual friend Jeff Carlson tweeted
[01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:20.860]  Oh, yeah yesterday about all these years later and shake to undo still stinks or something like that or a dumb idea
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:23.260]  I forget I don't want to put words in his mouth. Hold on. Let me look it up
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:27.780]  But anyway, I wrote a piece on shake to undo. No, it's good. It's good and the fundamental
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:33.060]  Unmisunderstanding I think is is undo good and the answer is yes undo is good
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:38.220]  It's the only way to undo being to grab your phone and like shake it in the air like an idiot. Is that good?
[01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:41.260]  Maybe not
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:47.860]  Here's Jeff Carlson's tweet so many years in and shake to undo is still one of the worst stupidest ideas in iOS. I
[01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:52.180]  Would add but I would add though. I bring it up in the in
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:58.380]  It in this it that it is an example though of whimsy, right? It is whimsical to use the accelerometer
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.620]  To to add this feature
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.140]  You know and I add I add this anecdote that I heard years ago
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:12.140]  I don't know if it's true because I did not hear it firsthand. So who knows but the idea that story I heard
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:15.620]  Somewhat reliably but again not firsthand
[01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.980]  Is that at some point like two or three years into iOS like at the time where they were you remember?
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.900]  It was only iOS 3 that added cut copy and paste
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:28.280]  Like that's how much iOS rethought the entire idea of a graphical user interface
[01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:30.980]  And they knew they wanted undo
[01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:37.920]  But if you think about it, it's really hard on a little glass iPhone size thing where every little
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:43.380]  Finger size bit of surface area is valuable and the keyboard isn't
[01:55:43.940 --> 01:55:48.980]  Available all the time and even when the keyboard is showing there are no modifier keys
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:53.080]  So you can't do command Z for undo. How do you do undo?
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:58.300]  And the Newton did it by adding an actual like one of like six
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:03.180]  There are six hardware buttons under the screen that were there permanently and one of them was undo
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:09.260]  That's that's how hard it is to do undo on a on a touchscreen without a menu bar and without
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:10.980]  command key shortcuts
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:16.540]  So the Newton solution was to just have one of one sixth of the buttons that were on the screen
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.540]  One of them was undo
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:22.900]  Obviously, they're not going to do that with the iPhone and I don't think it would have been a good
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.660]  It's a tricky problem to solve and the story I heard though
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.380]  Is that Scott forced all got a bunch of iOS engineers together?
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:33.320]  So we got to figure this out somebody come up with an idea and somebody said as a joke
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.520]  You could just shake the phone, you know
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.140]  we read the accelerometer and when anybody shakes the phone will do undo and
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:46.260]  It was meant as joke because it was so obviously a terrible idea, but for stall jumped on it and said I love it
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:48.260]  Let's do that. And you know
[01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:54.980]  Here we are. It's ingenious. It really is. I just keep thinking like and maybe some of this is evangelizing
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:57.860]  You point out in that piece that the iPad, you know
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:04.260]  There's an undo button in the strip in the autocorrect strip basically above the keyboard and it's always there
[01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.140]  And there's actually when you got something on the clipboard
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:10.780]  there's also a paste button there, which is really nice when you're editing text if you're in an app like
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:17.340]  Some of the photo editing apps they have a you know, they have an explicit undo button
[01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:23.500]  But I get that like every now and then you're somewhere and you're in an app that does not have like a content interface
[01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:27.900]  that's drawn up that has an undo button and you do something and you're like, oh no and
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.760]  Shake to undo. I mean the fact is it's well, it's not always there
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:35.620]  I was gonna say that but apps have to support it
[01:57:35.620 --> 01:57:39.260]  But at least it's something that you can use as a last resort
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:41.540]  but I don't disagree with Jeff that like
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:46.900]  Ideally, this should be solved and I think Apple has tried to start solving it by like putting it in
[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:52.540]  Context in like the text editing strip above the keyboard, whatever they call that the smart something or other
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:57.540]  I'll just throw out an example. This is just right off the top of my head
[01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:06.900]  Terrible idea they could have said put four fingers on the iPhone screen and move down and that's undo and
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:10.740]  That also is a terrible idea is not discoverable
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:16.620]  Not something people would intuitively know about you do you have to hear about it from somebody and then remember it and then do it
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:20.380]  But that would have no whim. There's no whimsy to that at all, right?
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:26.300]  so shake to undo the one thing and it does have going for it as opposed to let's say a four finger swipe down or
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:30.460]  Swipe in a circle or whatever you want to do with multi fingers
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:38.380]  Shake to undo does have whimsy and that's why I brought it up in the context of these whatever happened to
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:45.340]  Apple and whimsy is there there was in you know times past more of a I don't think shake to undo would would
[01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:48.500]  Would fly today. I really I don't think they would do that again
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:54.940]  No, no, I wonder what you could do. Yeah. I mean, it's a hard problem. That's the funny thing
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:56.580]  It's like shake to undo is ridiculous
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:02.060]  I think the fact that it still exists says something about how hard it is though to solve that problem. Yeah, it is hard
[01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:06.420]  It's really hard. You can't take it out unless you replace it with something and it's very hard to do
[01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:12.860]  So it remains it is super ingenious. Maybe at some point they'll just have that sensor bar in the front
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:16.400]  We'll like see us scowling and be like I sense that they made a mistake
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:22.500]  Would you like to undo it like just an eyebrow based undo system? Maybe eventually? I don't know
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:27.780]  Maybe the best solution would be to just have it listen and you know you if you just say undo Siri
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.140]  Siri as an undo
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:38.220]  Shortcut that is actually not bad. Hey Siri undo. Oh, I should I shouldn't be saying that I should say hey dingus, but well, whatever well
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:45.860]  It shouldn't it shouldn't bother anybody who has this podcast playing audibly because Siri doesn't support undo yet. Yeah
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:52.300]  Just wait until a Siri can support, you know, wipe my hard drive
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:56.020]  Be all sorts of fun on
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:57.660]  podcasts
[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:01.060]  alright, let me take one last break here and thank our third and
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.060]  Final sponsor it is our good friends at
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.340]  Casper
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:12.060]  Oddly enough a year ago when you were on the episode a year ago Casper and Squarespace were sponsors of the show
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:18.460]  So it's truly an amazing serendipity. Look what is slapper cat slapper?
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.380]  What the hell am I talking about Casper Casper is a sleep brand?
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:24.620]  I obviously conflated sleep and Casper and came up with slapper
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:31.640]  But Casper is a sleep brand that makes expertly designed products to help you get your best rest
[02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.640]  one night at a time
[02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:39.180]  They've got their own engineering team. They really do. This isn't like some kind of thing where they buy
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:44.620]  Chinese mattresses and put a Casper sticker on them and sell them to you with their own branding or whatever
[02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:48.340]  they've got their own engineering team and they design these mattresses and
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.560]  They put them together right here in the USA
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:57.280]  Look you spend a third of your life sleeping you deserve to be comfortable. They've got three
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:06.020]  Models now they've got the original Casper mattress combines multiple supportive memory phones for a quality sleep surface a
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:13.060]  breathable design so you don't get too hot you don't get too cold everything breathes and they have two other new mattresses the wave and
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:15.020]  the essential the wave
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:21.520]  Features a patent pending premium support system to mirror the natural shape of your body. They've got the essential
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:25.060]  That's their streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:32.580]  It's still a great mattress and they've got a wide variety now of other products like pillows sheets comforters stuff like that
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:38.860]  I honest to God I'm it's not they did they sent me a mattress a long time ago free and I use it and I
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:39.820]  like it
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:44.620]  But I've since we bought I mean, this is just out-of-pocket bought the the comforter
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:50.700]  We've got I've got the pillows on my side too. I bought the sheets and the pillows the comforter
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.740]  I got to tell you I'm just telling you and again
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:55.980]  I'm selling a mattress here on the sponsor read but I'm telling you we had an old comforter
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:58.820]  My wife and I that I don't even know how many years we'd had it
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:03.340]  One of those things that you just you don't really keep track of how old it is and my wife was my wife's idea
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:05.820]  She said she I don't know if she read something or something
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:12.820]  But you know how comforters have those they're like rows of stitching and the idea is that keeps the the internal
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:16.820]  Whatever it's filled with from getting all on one side or at the bottom or the top
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.340]  It's you know
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:20.980]  The way that the comforters are stitched is to try to keep that but that over time
[02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:27.420]  Those it doesn't work anymore and you end up with a bad distribution and I swear to God we got the Casper
[02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:29.180]  comforter
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:35.100]  Sometime a couple months ago and it was still chilly and the difference in like regulating my temperature when I slept was unbelievable
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:36.780]  It really is
[02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:39.060]  It's really it's bizarre thing
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:42.140]  It's just one of those things that I never would have thought would be a big deal
[02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:46.100]  But getting a new comforter was absolutely a huge upgrade and I love their pillows
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:52.300]  We also we have the new Casper wave in our guest bedroom and it's so good that my son
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:58.700]  Was who has a regular Casper mattress was like sleeping on it for three nights and we're like get out of the guest bedroom
[02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.700]  You've already got a nice bed
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:07.700]  It's really it. They're just great products and we love them. We've got them all over the house and people fight over them
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:13.840]  So here's the deal I got to tell you this you can be sure of your purchase even though if you're at any way
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:19.680]  Skeptical of buying an internet mattress without trying it or sleeping on it or jumping on it or whatever
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.460]  You could do in a retail store. They have a hundred night risk-free sleep on it trial
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:31.060]  So go order one have it show up. It shows up in this tiny little ridiculous too small to be good true box
[02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:34.260]  If you get the wave it even comes with
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:40.580]  White glove service where somebody else they'll come in and lift it up and take the box to your bedroom and and set it
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:42.420]  Up and stuff like that
[02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:49.140]  And you get a hundred nights to try it out risk-free and then no hassle look 99 days in you don't want it
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:52.020]  Call them up. They'll come take it away and give you all your money back
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.780]  That's how confident they are in it
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:57.620]  It's a really great product
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:02.140]  So my thanks to Casper. Here's what you got to do. You can get 50 bucks off

[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:46.140]  Um last thing I wanted to talk about I don't know if you had anything you wanted to bring up
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:51.880]  But I'm working on one more piece. I'm prolific this week. Yeah big week for you. Yeah, I've still got another one
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:54.040]  It's mostly written and I got I got interrupted
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:59.800]  Is I I think it's interesting that nobody has been speculating
[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:05.140]  Until now about what the hell is Apple gonna call the new iPhones this year
[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:11.740]  Right because last year it and and this is one of those things that Apple is able to keep secret the name iPhone 10
[02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:16.300]  only leaked like two or three days before the announcement because of a
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:23.140]  Leak of the GM build of iOS and even then we didn't know if it was gonna be pronounced iPhone X or iPhone 10
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:27.980]  and I guessed wrong and thought X because I didn't think 10 made a lot of sense and I
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:32.260]  Was wrong that they were gonna pronounce it X not 10
[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:35.620]  But I was right that it didn't make a lot of sense because it seems like they've painted
[02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:38.700]  Themselves into a corner if they want to keep adding numbers
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:43.460]  And I'm curious if you have any thoughts on this I
[02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:47.100]  Yeah, you know I do I love this
[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:52.260]  I was the one who was advocating that they get OS 10 off of version 10 and go to 11 for ages
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:55.900]  Which they could do now at any point if they really wanted to because out of the name entirely
[02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:02.900]  90 is gonna be the last version so yeah
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:08.620]  I do I think it's interesting that they chose 10 instead of X for the name of the iPhone because I
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:13.620]  Think doing like an iPhone X 2 would be cool
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:18.280]  but 10 2 doesn't make any sense so I
[02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:25.000]  I'm gonna say I think what it's gonna be is I think there are these three rumored foam models
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.940]  I think it's gonna be the iPhone 9 the iPhone 10 new
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:35.700]  2018 version and the iPhone 10 plus I think they're gonna I think Apple really likes making
[02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:38.260]  multiple products with the same
[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:45.660]  X right the new iPhone 10 the new iPhone 10 right and then ride it like the ones that look like this and have this
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:49.940]  Sensor and do the OLED screen and all that you're gonna be the iPhone 10 for a little while all right
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:56.700]  Let me toss this out. Yeah, I wonder if they might not be done with Plus like so in a way that the 13 inch and 15
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:07:02.860]  inch MacBook Pros are just MacBook Pros and the two sizes of iPad Pro or just iPad Pro forget the pro part
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:06.680]  Even though I still there's a part of me that thinks that they could go iPhone Pro
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:11.860]  But I don't know that they would go iPhone Pro with this one that looks exactly like the iPhone 10, right?
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:15.900]  I think if they were gonna switch to iPhone Pro, they'd wait till they had one that looks yeah
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:19.060]  later, you know yeah, but the thing about Plus is
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:24.260]  Obviously the first thing people think of is okay the 7 plus the 8 plus are bigger
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:31.960]  But the plus also meant other things right the camera was always slightly better the iPhone plus models had
[02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:38.340]  3x retina screens not 2x retina screens so in addition to being bigger screens. They actually had more pixels per inch
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:42.860]  so you were getting more than just a bigger phone and I
[02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:48.500]  I don't know the details. I I you know, I have no supply side it but all the rumors
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:55.020]  I've seen about these two new iPhone 10 models the one that's exactly the same size as the current iPhone 10 and the big
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:08:01.420]  6.5 inch diagonal one. I haven't seen anybody say that the 6.5 one is going to have any
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:08.060]  Advantage technical advantage whatsoever other than a bigger screen that the cameras will be exactly the same
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:13.060]  The pixels per inch of the OLED displays would be the same
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:21.500]  Right, so more more pixels, but same resolution the 3x right or are you thinking the same pixels just blown up?
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:26.900]  I would imagine it's just more pixels. I would imagine it's just more pixels at the same pixels per inch. Yeah
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:30.340]  Yeah, I agree. That makes sense. So I wouldn't think blown up
[02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:35.860]  I would think more pixels but at the exact, you know effectively cut from the same sheets of OLED
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:40.460]  But that like in the thing that always bothered me and maybe I just read too much into it
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:45.420]  But as somebody who doesn't like the biggest size phones and has never carried a plus-size phone
[02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:48.660]  Longer than like a week to review one. Yeah same here
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:54.460]  It always bothered me that I wasn't that was no longer getting the best possible iPhone camera
[02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:58.820]  You know that the the 6 plus had optical image
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:04.860]  Stabilization for video the next year it had optical image stabilization for video and still
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:09.860]  I think I don't know that I know that the technical difference was that it had optical image stabilization in the one year
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:11.860]  It was video and the one year it was video and stills
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:18.500]  And then the second the second camera right and then it got a second camera
[02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:24.740]  You know, which is that's where it really started to hurt right because you're obviously and I use that second camera a lot
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:26.300]  And there you know for them, you know
[02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:30.460]  I don't know what percentage I would actually be interesting if I could script that somehow and see
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:38.260]  What percentage of my iPhone pictures I take with which lens I would guess that I take about 95% of my photos with the 1x
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:44.220]  lens and about five five percent with the 2x, but when I take one with the 2x, I'm getting a
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:52.060]  Summer and some of them are great photos and I'm getting image quality that I would never get that blows away what I would get
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:54.580]  With a zoomed in version of the 1x. Mm-hmm
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:56.380]  That really bothered me
[02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:01.020]  Whereas I don't think this one is actually plus other than being bigger
[02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:05.540]  Yeah, but I think in the end maybe that's all that matters is that it's bigger
[02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:07.540]  I do have a theory and it's just a theory
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:14.220]  Mike Hurley and I talked about this on our podcast upgrade this week because he's a big plus phone user
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.820]  Yes, and he's a big Apple Apple pencil fan
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:20.200]  And I don't I think it's less than 50% chance
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:24.160]  But I feel like it's the biggest chance we've had in a long time to say
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:30.160]  Maybe this is the year that Apple introduces a phone that has support for a you know
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.840]  An Apple pencil like device it would have to be smaller than the current Apple pencil
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:41.280]  But something like that where you could basically say it's like, you know, it's their equivalent of the galaxy note where it's it's a big phone
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:41.880]  It's so big
[02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:45.760]  it's like a notebook, you know, like a paper notebook not a laptop notebook and
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:50.000]  you can hold it in your hand and use use our little golf pencil or whatever they call it and
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:54.080]  The software is all already there because it's already there for the Apple pencil on the iPad
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:57.360]  To do something like that and that would be a way to differentiate it
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:03.860]  Right if the iPhone 10 plus also had Apple pencil support because it because then it sort of makes sense on the bigger screen
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:07.080]  You can sketch you could write that's that's a theory again
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:09.280]  I would probably not put money down on that
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:16.200]  But I feel like it might be something they could do to make that a different product in addition to just having it be bigger
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:21.080]  Which some people for some people that's all they really want is a bigger beautiful screen
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:24.640]  They don't care how big their phone is. They want it as big as possible, right?
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:30.320]  I yeah, that is an interesting theory and again nobody I don't think any rumor has said it but it also seems like maybe
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:34.200]  There's a lot we don't know yet about what exactly, you know
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.320]  mainly what it seems like we know about are the displays that that there's
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:42.880]  You know a 5.8 inch diagonal OLED, which is exactly like the iPhone 10
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:48.200]  We have now in the new iPhone 10, which is as fine a name if whether it's the actual name or not
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:52.000]  It certainly is clear what we're talking about. There's a 6.5 inch OLED
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:59.680]  Of similar technology or perhaps exact same technology in this bigger new iPhone 10
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.240]  And that's a yeah, that is pretty 6.5 inch diagonal. It's pretty big. It's huge and then weirdly
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:11.120]  There's a 6.1 inch diagonal which is about halfway between with an LCD screen
[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:18.200]  But also with the iPhone 10 style notch and corner-to-corner around design that is, you know
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:23.880]  Obvious obviously since it's using an LCD is going to be lower priced, you know, probably like an $800 starting
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:26.400]  point
[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:33.240]  That pencil rumor it would be interesting I could see that and I could see them making that argument that you know
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:38.560]  Cuz it's 6.5 inches diagonal. It is arguably a small tablet as much as it is a large phone
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.120]  Exactly. It's not I mean, yeah, it's getting to that point
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.960]  it's not quite an iPad mini or something like that in terms of the because of the
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:49.160]  Aspect ratio and all that but there are a couple of reports about it
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.420]  It's unclear how much of this is echo chamber and how much of this is individual reports
[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:58.640]  But there are a couple of reports that suggest that pencil support could be there for one or both of those models
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.920]  Yeah, see that's the question is it would it be one or both and the other nagging thing?
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:05.360]  Yeah, cuz you could do it for both. It wouldn't have to limit it
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.080]  the other nagging thing that I'll throw in there is like sometimes Apple does stuff and you're like
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:15.960]  Oh, that's interesting. And then you look later and you're like, oh they were like moving towards something that we didn't realize is
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.080]  the
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.080]  Apple pencil and
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:23.860]  That Logitech crayon on the low-cost iPad
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.560]  I think that's interesting because they built an entire new
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:35.400]  Way and a new radio method of connecting a stylus to an iPad for that because the the crayon
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:42.440]  Doesn't use the Bluetooth connection that the pencil does it uses this other radio connection means you don't have to pair it
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.480]  You can actually just write on any iPad in a classroom and it'll work and at the time I was like, okay
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:51.480]  Well that makes sense for schools and now I look at it and I think well
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:57.440]  Are they tinkering with how pencils work and are we gonna see a new kind of pencil technology in the new iPad pros?
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.760]  this fall and
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.440]  Maybe in the new iPhones this fall
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:07.360]  maybe not maybe not but like it this could be the time that they do something like that and what I like about this idea is
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:14.240]  Is that like I said earlier they I've done the job like the software is all there like literally on iOS
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:19.560]  I think starting with 11 if you put a pencil onto a lock screen it turns into a note
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:26.280]  Hmm and you can just take notes and it just it's taken automatically into a new note without you even unlocking the device
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.680]  It's like how great would that be on a phone? That's pretty smart and it's already in there. Hmm
[02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:37.440]  My guess is and I I I could be wrong. I don't I like yours I do
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:41.280]  I might have I might have to steal them. I'm glad I haven't published this article. Yeah, I
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:47.120]  Kind of I have this nagging feeling in the back of my head that
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:54.000]  So Apple did this thing where they would just add an S at the end of a model year for the second year for a long
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:00.360]  Time they had the iPhone 3g then the 3gs and the 3gs outsold the 3g and then they had the iPhone 4 and the iPhone
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:06.000]  4s and the 4s sold out because they just sales kept going up year over year for with every year and in fact
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.680]  Up until a certain point and I'm not quite sure where that was iPhone 5 or 5s
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:17.440]  Maybe but up until a certain point not only was each successive model year of the iPhone better selling than any previous one
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:24.720]  each successive model year outsold all previous model years combined which is
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:28.520]  Just is a great way to think about how staggeringly
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:34.560]  fast and how many years the iPhone growth was where it went from this thing that was
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:41.040]  You know famous with our crowd to being this thing. That was everywhere, you know in the most popular brand name and
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:50.040]  and most most profitable profit our product ever made each year outsold all previous years combined until a
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.360]  ridiculous number of years into the iPhone
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:56.360]  5s outsold the 5 iPhone 6 was
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  absolutely
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:15:59.000]  You know
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:06.140]  Maybe the most surprisingly best-selling iPhone year ever like Apple was supply constrained longer than they expected
[02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:13.300]  It was as much as Apple and might have anticipated that there were people waiting for bigger iPhones because that was of course the year
[02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:19.180]  Where it went from four inch diagonal to four point eight and the plus size five point five
[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:21.820]  They were supply constrained
[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:27.020]  It was unbelievable and then they came out with the 6s and the 6s was the first iPhone generation
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.820]  That was a quote disappointment and I forget to what degree it was
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:35.300]  I forget if it didn't actually I don't think it declined here over here. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:42.100]  Yeah, it was it did the six year was this huge year and everybody went crazy like oh my god
[02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:49.060]  the iPhone is exploding right and then Apple lived it down the next year where they missed their year-over-year growth like three consecutive quarters because
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:56.420]  There was so much pent-up demand for the bigger phones and the six is where they all went right and it's funny because only
[02:16:56.700 --> 02:17:02.580]  This year in the last couple of quarters has Apple gotten to the point where they're back up to the there
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:07.340]  They're now just above the average of sales level of that peak
[02:17:07.340 --> 02:17:12.700]  It took them like this long for their natural growth to reach the peak of the iPhone 6, right?
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:15.380]  Because so many people have been waiting for a bigger iPhone
[02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:18.560]  I really think that's just the base and they could have called these phones anything
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:24.540]  They wanted to numbers letters totally and I still think you would have seen that with that first generation of big ones
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:26.600]  But I can't help but think that Apple
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  It saw that and and and that and I think they might be right that that to some degree in the early
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:39.600]  Years, it was still more of a tech person product, right it it, you know
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:46.900]  It it it it's slowly transferred from being something for Apple nerds to something for every
[02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:50.600]  Everyone who could afford one and in that transition
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:58.420]  And in that transition that there became more and more of a consumer level awareness of what was new in a new iPhone and less
[02:17:58.420 --> 02:17:59.560]  of a hey
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:05.680]  I can tell you that the iPhone 5s has a 64-bit processor and that's a big deal because everybody thought 64-bit was
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.880]  Years away for mobile, you know for arm and it's like, you know, try telling that to a normal person
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  It's like what the hell you're talking about
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:16.120]  I can't help but think that with the 6s
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:21.920]  They're the perception that ah, they just took it's just the same as the iPhone 6 and they put an s at the end
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:27.880]  And there's nothing no big it's not worth buying and I can't help but wonder if Apple got spooked away
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.720]  from that reusing a number two years in a row because people won't see it as a
[02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.520]  You know as an upgrade. Mm-hmm
[02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:41.280]  So I don't know but they could you know, the word new is powerful
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.480]  So they could just say the the new iPhone 10 and maybe that's enough one thing
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:49.720]  they won't do and I I forget if you mention this or not, they're not gonna call it the
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:56.400]  The X 2 because we're not supposed to say X even though X 2 sounds like a cool phone, but we call it the 10
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.400]  But they also won't call it the 10s
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:02.420]  because
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:08.840]  So many people and this is one of the reasons I thought they wouldn't pronounce the X as 10 say it X anyway, right?
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:14.280]  I I wouldn't be surprised if a majority of the people who walk into an Apple store to buy one call it the iPhone X
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:16.840]  But it's certainly a significant minority
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:23.240]  But then those people they don't want them calling it the excess because then it sounds like the word excess and that's you know
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:25.240]  a word with negative connotations
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:27.800]  So they're not gonna call it the ass
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:28.320]  Yeah
[02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:34.760]  I we've been waiting for this moment where they say the new iPhone right because I think everybody's sort of agreed that
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:41.100]  It seemed unlikely that Apple in in ten years time would be selling the iPhone 17, right?
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:48.380]  Right there has to get they have to get off the treadmill sometime and the iPhone 10 being the X instead of a number
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:50.900]  even though you say it like a number I
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:55.460]  Just I looked at that last year and I thought well, maybe this is maybe they'll get off the treadmill now
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:59.820]  Maybe not but it's just like Apple has a history of getting to 10 and being like this is good
[02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:02.900]  I'm gonna stay here for a while and I could see them doing it
[02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:06.780]  It would be a big deal keeping in mind that they if they have an iPhone 9 or whatever
[02:20:06.780 --> 02:20:09.700]  They call that LCD phone and they have a plus
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:13.380]  Like that's two brand new products
[02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:19.300]  So if they have those two and they say also the 10 got better, right? I think that they can get away with that
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:22.180]  I don't think people are gonna be like, well, they didn't do anything with a 10
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:24.260]  It's like no, it's the new 10 the 10 got better, too
[02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:27.820]  Yeah, but that do they need to give it a new name in order to make that claim
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:31.100]  I don't think they do I think saying it's the new iPhone. It's this year's iPhone
[02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:34.220]  It's the next iPhone 10 is something they could get away with
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:39.980]  I could I could my idea and and now that I'm looking at it and I'm listening to you you're changing my mind
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:42.860]  But my idea is if they stick with numbers that they would go
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:50.860]  iPhone 11 iPhone 11 plus and then not Roman numerals 1 1 and I've and iPhone 9 for the LCD version
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:56.660]  11 it could 11 plus and now you'll finally get my spinal tap appearance at an Apple event if they do that and
[02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:02.220]  That I've got that I've got it. I've got it goes to 11 joke. Yeah, I draft. Yeah, there we go
[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:04.220]  I've got one in there already
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:10.700]  And one of the reasons I thought that this might be possible is that it by keeping the numbers two
[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:15.640]  Digits apart not just 10 and 9 but 11 and 9 it justifies that
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:20.820]  $200 price difference between what I presume to be the starting price of this
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:27.380]  6.1 inch LCD one of $800 and why in the world would you spend an extra 200 and and
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:29.940]  Probably 300 to get the plus model
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:31.100]  um
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:34.140]  Well, it's two generations ahead. I don't know
[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:37.640]  And then I'll go back. I will go back to
[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:41.700]  Bang my hop. But here's the thing. Even if they go 11 and 9
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:45.580]  What do they do next year because the the mid tier model can't go to 10?
[02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:50.700]  Because they've already has 10 like one of the problems is that they can't just key
[02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:56.500]  I feel like they can't just keep adding a digit to the high end because eventually you're gonna get to like you said like iPhone
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:01.500]  17 I mean even iPhone 13 might be something they want. Yeah, nobody nobody wants that
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:06.780]  So here's a wild card because I I've been calling it the iPhone 9 because I don't know what else to call it
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:14.020]  But given how different that phone is like it's way bigger than the iPhone 8 and 7 and 6 right all of which look exactly
[02:22:14.020 --> 02:22:15.660]  the same
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.660]  It's the same design style
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:20.580]  And this is totally different. This is more like an iPhone 10
[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:27.900]  It might not call the iPhone 9 it might be called the iPhone something else to differentiate it. That isn't number-based at all
[02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:30.300]  right and
[02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:33.260]  Again, you look at Apple's other product lines
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:38.760]  It gets it uncouples the iPhone from a number or at least a number as the only branding
[02:22:38.760 --> 02:22:44.540]  So then they could have the iPhone whatever and the iPhone the new iPhone 10 and the new iPhone 10 plus and if they do
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:50.060]  That they could keep iterating those products for a while without ever changing their names and just saying it's the new one and out
[02:22:50.060 --> 02:22:54.620]  Here's my idea and it's just might just I might be the only one who wants them to go this way
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:58.100]  But I'll go back to my guests from last year, which is iPhone Pro
[02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:00.380]  for the
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:01.820]  OLED models
[02:23:01.820 --> 02:23:07.060]  Maybe with and I don't think they'd ever say Pro Plus because then it starts to sound like it so they just call them both
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:12.960]  iPhone Pro and one of them's bigger and one of them smaller exactly like I iPad Pro exactly like MacBook Pro
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:18.980]  Both have the same name one's bigger one smaller. Nobody's confused because it's obvious which one's bigger. It's bigger
[02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:21.780]  And then the other one would just be called iPhone
[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:25.180]  Now that's that sounds nice and neat
[02:23:25.180 --> 02:23:28.660]  But then it's all conflated by the fact that Apple continues to sell
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:36.500]  Old iPhones for years and years at lower price points beneath these two new tiers and then you've got iPhone Pro iPhone
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:41.980]  It sounds good enough, but then you've still got what iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 or whatever
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.980]  I don't know what they plan to keep around
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.900]  Embedded in my theory about them
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:50.700]  Just saying it's the new iPhone 10 is the idea that the iPhone 10 is a very high-end
[02:23:51.500 --> 02:23:52.740]  product
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:59.540]  Doesn't trickle down right? That's part of my theory there is that exactly is that maybe they maybe it costs $9.99
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:05.120]  Maybe it goes down in price, but like there's no last year's model for sale of the iPhone 10, right?
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:09.020]  You don't get you they're not gonna sell the old iPhone 10 for $8.99
[02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:14.380]  That's like no no. No if you want the iPhone 10, it's $9.99 to start and you can get the new one
[02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:15.940]  That's a big change for them
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:20.140]  but if they've got other products in the line if they still sell the the eight and
[02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:24.700]  They've got this new thing nine or whatever they call it and then they've got the new tens
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:29.700]  Like they still got a product spread there. There is a question over time. Like how do they do it? But like the SE
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:31.980]  Similarly, which hasn't been updated in a while
[02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:37.840]  But the SE is the same thing where it's like they can call things the SE and just increment the year and still
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:42.580]  So eventually you may end up in a scenario where instead of this trickle-down of old products
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:47.460]  Maybe this is a four-year deal where they're in the middle of it now of migrating to this
[02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:51.780]  They have different iPhone models that change every year at different price points
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:55.020]  which means that you're buying the latest and greatest of the
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:25:02.180]  iPhone SE instead of buying a three-year-old iPhone and I think for some people that might be more appealing to be like
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:07.680]  I've got the 2018 model iPhone SE instead of yeah, I've got the 2016 iPhone
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:12.780]  That's all I could afford like it. It feels better to have the latest low-end model
[02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:15.960]  I think rather than the high-end model from three years ago
[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:16.520]  Yeah
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:23.380]  And the other thing that is specific to iPhone and only iPhone at least in Apple's world, although the watch might be close
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:30.820]  Is that it is it is pretty pretty regularly annual and it has been since the iPhone
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:36.980]  5 I believe the 4s was the one that came out in October
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:44.500]  Right after Steve Jobs died and then ever since it's been like first or second Tuesday or Wednesday in September
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:48.780]  Every single year and no other Apple product is like that, right?
[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:53.460]  Even the iPad isn't as annual and like I mentioned earlier in the show the iPad Pro
[02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:57.940]  that is but pro models that are currently for sale are both well over a year old and
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:26:03.500]  and there is to me something to the you know, and the iPhone is obviously the most important product Apple makes by
[02:26:03.900 --> 02:26:07.620]  You know any measure you could possibly measure and so having that
[02:26:08.540 --> 02:26:15.540]  You know unique new this is obviously the latest and greatest name every year might factor into that to some degree
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:21.020]  Because it you know, it's not meant to sit around as the top tier phone for 18 months or 24 months
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:26.140]  But I don't know it's the I'm sure there are lots of branding experts out there who are
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:31.280]  Have lots of opinions about what Apple should do with this product since it is one of the most successful products out there
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:37.280]  I I do look at the Apple watch and think with the Apple watch they've managed to do something where it's always Apple watch
[02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:44.120]  Mm-hmm, but there is a tag to it. Yeah changes, right, right and in some ways I feel like that's the ideal
[02:26:44.740 --> 02:26:47.440]  Right, but but you know, maybe with something that's more computer
[02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:52.320]  You don't need to do that and something with fashion a you do but like the beauty of the Apple watch series 3 is
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:57.940]  That it's an Apple watch people don't look at my Apple watch and say oh, is that the series 3 they say?
[02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:00.560]  Oh, you have an Apple watch and which one is it?
[02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:05.640]  And I said, well, this is the one with GPS or I say this is a series 3 but and it's on their website
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:12.560]  It's like Apple watch series 3 but it's the Apple watch. The name is still Apple watch. The number is a tag
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:17.140]  It's a it's a subhead. It's not the product name and I don't know
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:22.920]  Is that where Apple wants to go with the iPhone like would they really rather it be the iPhone?
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:29.520]  Series something or iPhone some other kind of like sub subhead a little like secondary name for it
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.160]  That tells you what model it is or again. The simplest thing is it's this year's model
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:37.260]  This is the new iPhone 10 for 2018
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:43.480]  It's it's what's what's amazing about this and is why sometimes I'm very very very very very happy to not
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:48.060]  Be one of the people in the room at Apple. It's like this is product is so important
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:56.040]  And it's like don't screw this up guys, right? Like every marketing decision they make a naming decision they make is
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.200]  potentially a
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:02.760]  billions of dollars mistake and you know
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:08.440]  We talk about how weird the Mac laptop line has been but like Apple can survive some weirdness in the Mac line
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:13.920]  Apple, I mean they can survive anything I suppose but Apple does really does not want to screw up the iPhone
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:15.000]  So you got to do it, right?
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.800]  And I that is there's probably a lot of pressure and everybody in Phil Schiller's group
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:23.080]  Who sits around talking about how these things are going to get branded? I?
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:26.000]  After the event last year
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.700]  I did speak to Schiller briefly and I joke because I know he reads my site and I know or at least he reads it
[02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:38.760]  Like before an event like that, and I just broke the ice by saying oh my god. I was hoping it was X not 10
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:42.400]  and he'd looked at me and laughed and and and
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:48.440]  And I said something like I can't even imagine how much thinking goes into that and he just looked at me and he got real
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:51.400]  Serious, and he just says we spent a lot of time thinking about this
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:59.080]  And I said like I'm not surprised I was like cuz it's important and he's like it was a lot of time
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:05.440]  Yeah, the amount of market research. That's the thing people don't don't really think about but like the market research
[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:08.280]  internal testing
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:14.320]  Research worldwide testing too. Yeah, cuz you it's such a worldwide product that you've got to think about things like
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:22.460]  You know, which you know, like 13 has an unlucky connotation in the US and maybe other Western countries
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:25.600]  but they're like I forget what the unlucky number in China is
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:30.560]  It might be eight though. I don't know because they didn't avoid that but I
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:34.140]  Forget, but you know you have to look into stuff. Yeah. Yeah
[02:29:34.140 --> 02:29:40.160]  Well, you don't want a name that it turns out is a horrible reference in one of your major markets, right?
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:45.440]  You would you'd want to avoid that too. So yeah the amount of effort that goes into that then again what I do like to
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:47.400]  think is
[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:52.760]  Here it's yet like two of us just sitting here spitballing for a couple of hours like there are
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:56.480]  Probably dozens of people where this is their entire job
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:57.000]  Yeah
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.340]  And so these these are not you know us throwing around a couple ideas between two guys who were thinking about it
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:06.880]  And we think about it a lot but like we're just two people and we're only doing it for a few hours
[02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:09.200]  fortunately Apple
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:14.680]  can't afford to and needs to afford to pay people a lot of money to spend a lot of time and do a lot of
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:19.040]  Research to make the right decisions on this front. It's fascinating to see when those when those get rolled out
[02:30:19.040 --> 02:30:23.880]  Yeah, but you know, the iPhone name thing has been hanging over them for a while now or for a while
[02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:27.280]  It's like yeah iPhone 3g. Yes, iPhone 4. We'll do that
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:29.900]  We're gonna just that was the moment where they're like, nope
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:33.360]  We're gonna count up and we're just gonna call it 4 and the next ones, you know
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.040]  We'll do 4s and then we're gonna do 5 like ok
[02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:40.780]  That was really good. But even then you knew it couldn't go on like that forever
[02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:45.540]  Yeah, and how do you get off the the carousel and maybe they're getting off of it now
[02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:49.040]  Maybe they're not maybe they'll be iPhone 11 and we'll be like, all right here we keep going
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:52.320]  Real-time follow-up the unlucky number in China is 4
[02:30:53.200 --> 02:31:00.020]  So they obviously use that but I wonder if I wonder if China Chinese sales of iPhones at that time were low enough that they
[02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:06.520]  Weren't as worried Warren is worried. I wonder because Chinese iPhone sales didn't really take off until a bit later
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.880]  Yeah, I don't know any other advantage
[02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:16.360]  it advantage that Apple has internally at coming up with these names and the the
[02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:23.980]  Weight that hangs over their necks strategically thinking about it is that they also have the advantage of knowing the roadmap
[02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:31.040]  You know like so for example the the iPhones for next year are already set
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:34.680]  I mean there might be minor minor things that are that are still up in the air
[02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:40.740]  But at this point on the calendar the iPhones that are coming out 13 months from now are effectively set
[02:31:40.740 --> 02:31:46.960]  Or mostly set right very very they have to get the contracts for the components. It is pliers and it's yeah it is
[02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:54.880]  I'm of the I've beaten the drum that the lead time on iPhones is longer than most people expect, you know, like last year
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:58.600]  It came up over and over again because there were these bizarre
[02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:02.560]  reports that came up in July that Apple was still trying to integrate a
[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:07.680]  Fingerprint sensor into the iPhone 10 which it number one
[02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:12.680]  It wasn't true, but number it's impossible as late as July. It just isn't is not possible
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:19.040]  You know the only counterexample I can ever think of was the iPod touch that was supposed to have a camera
[02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:25.120]  I think it was an iPod touch that was supposed to have a camera and then at the last minute they took the camera out
[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:30.080]  But they could do that at sort of the last minute because it didn't really mean
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:37.000]  Re-engineering anything they just didn't put the camera in and kept the aluminum back from getting
[02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:38.860]  Drilled where the camera hole would be
[02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:39.080]  Yeah
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:43.480]  there was still there was still like all the hole where the thing was raised to go and on the circuit board and all that and
[02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:45.320]  it wasn't there and right like
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:51.600]  Apple watch was like that where they had like extra like an extra port or something that was gonna be able to connect to
[02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:55.640]  Like smart watch bands and they're like, nope, we're not gonna do that and I took it out
[02:32:55.640 --> 02:32:59.360]  Fairly late in the game, right? So yeah, it is
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.840]  They can take stuff out late in the game. They can't add stuff like a fingerprint sensor late
[02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:08.080]  No way and the branding stuff probably is a conversation that's that's got some ebbs and flows
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:10.340]  But also they know what the product map is and this takes us
[02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:16.920]  It's funny here at the end takes us all the way back to the beginning of this podcast, which is like the Mac laptop stuff
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:25.800]  That's what happens when you look at a roadmap and you think it's gonna be one thing and you make those naming decisions
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:28.400]  You know, we're gonna call this MacBook MacBook Air is gonna go away
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:31.620]  We're gonna do that and then something happens and you're like, oh
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:36.040]  But we made these decisions based on an assumption that turned out not to be true
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:41.800]  and now we have to figure out how to you know navigate that and and that's the flip side of this is that these are
[02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:45.440]  things where you make a decision and you're looking two three four years out and
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:52.040]  The long if you can execute it's great and every now and then something happens. You're like, oh, okay
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.900]  we made some decisions thinking it would be this and it's gonna be that and
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:59.180]  but you're right, I think like yeah, they know what the iPhone where the iPhone is going and
[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:01.280]  Calling it iPhone 10
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:06.020]  That very clearly had to be part of the thought process and knowing that this other phone was coming out
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:11.060]  Whatever they're gonna call it and how would that fit in and and the other larger model and how does that fit in?
[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:14.700]  And then what they do next year, how does that fit in? Like that's I think that's really cool
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:16.120]  That would be a really cool job to have
[02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:22.700]  I'm just saying I'm not sure I could sleep well at night if that weight of all iPhone sales and marketing was on my shoulders
[02:34:22.700 --> 02:34:28.860]  So I you know, I hope I hope that Phil Schiller has a really good Casper mattress is what I'm saying
[02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:34.460]  All right, that is a perfect way to bring it full circle Jason. I thank you for coming back
[02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:40.420]  Thank you. I'll have to have you on in a year 20 23rd or 24th of August 2019
[02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:43.980]  I mean everybody can read your writing at
[02:34:44.620 --> 02:34:48.980]  Six colors spell spell the colors the whichever way you're comfortable with calm
[02:34:49.300 --> 02:34:55.340]  and you've always got links to your writing around the web at places like Mac world and I just saw your byline at
[02:34:56.060 --> 02:34:59.060]  Tom's hardware. Yeah, Tom's guide. Yeah, I'm right
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:04.920]  I'm writing sort of iPhone stuff there every couple of weeks for Phil my old pal Phil Michaels from Mac world works there now
[02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:08.980]  So I'm writing for him every other week too. You're good at this. You should do like podcasts
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:13.820]  You know, yeah podcasts are well, you know you you and I've had that conversation that now we you know
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:15.820]  we think of ourselves as writers and
[02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:20.460]  Now we're kind of podcasters who write on the side, but that that works
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:24.580]  Among the podcasts that you do there is
[02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:32.380]  There's upgrade which I think you just mentioned right? Yep with Mike Hurley over at where I was there. What's the URL?
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:38.360]  I've relay dot FM slash upgrade for that one and then the incomparable calm for all my other
[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:44.740]  Nonsense the pop culture once boy you can you could lose some time on the incomparable dot you could you could it's like
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:48.820]  Hundreds of episodes now and other shows and it just keeps going and going and going
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:51.340]  Well my thanks to you. I
[02:35:51.540 --> 02:35:56.740]  Really still blown away, but by the annual nature of this particular episode of the podcast
[02:35:56.740 --> 02:36:02.140]  I guess it's you know, your thoughts turn toward the Apple event. You're like, ah, let's speculate with Jason
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:05.740]  My guess is my guess is I'll contact you a year from now and I won't remember
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:14.160]  This is happened either the previous two years. I can't wait to talk about mechanical keyboards and and keyboard testers again then yeah
[02:36:14.860 --> 02:36:18.700]  And my thanks to our sponsors for this episode. We had Casper mattresses
[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:26.440]  Trace Pontes coffee and Squarespace where you can build your own website. My thanks to all of them and thanks to you again, Jason
[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:31.440]  Thanks, John
