[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  It's a very special week for you. You're now on the dole for both Google and Microsoft.
[00:08.560 --> 00:08.960]  Very cool.
[00:09.760 --> 00:12.160]  By the time this episode airs, that'll have been last week.
[00:13.280 --> 00:19.760]  Last week. Cool. We're in the future then also. Thanks to Facebook for sponsoring this week.
[00:19.760 --> 00:24.400]  Dan is referring to last week's Daring Fireball RSS feed sponsor, which was Google,
[00:24.400 --> 00:32.000]  who took the spot to advertise job openings for their iOS apps, which I think is actually a
[00:32.000 --> 00:39.360]  fantastic sponsorship. I hope they do well. If they get one good candidate out of it,
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.720]  they'll be delighted. Yeah, it's actually really smart. I'm actually surprised more companies
[00:44.720 --> 00:50.640]  haven't been looking to do. There are job boards. There's that one that a lot of the sites use.
[00:50.640 --> 00:57.040]  But companies like Google and Apple, too, and all the big tech companies spend so
[00:57.040 --> 01:04.800]  much money on recruiting, it's not even funny. And it's more and more. They all
[01:04.800 --> 01:07.440]  say that it's one of the biggest problems they have right now.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.600]  Oh, totally. Especially engineers. They're willing to buy them for a million dollars
[01:11.600 --> 01:18.240]  each in these acqui-hires. Surely a few blog sponsorships here and there are a good investment.
[01:18.240 --> 01:24.240]  Yeah. But actually, it inspired me to get out the only Android device in my house,
[01:25.600 --> 01:31.360]  which I've actually never used until today. It's a Nexus 7. I don't even know how we got it, but
[01:32.080 --> 01:38.000]  so long had passed between receiving it and trying to use it that it had actually been bricked.
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.640]  I plugged it in for a month and it still didn't charge at all.
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.520]  And then today, randomly, I'm throwing stuff out and I was like, oh, I should just throw out this
[01:49.520 --> 01:54.240]  stupid Nexus 7 that never worked. And I plugged it in and it started charging.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.240]  Who's to say?
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.000]  I've spent the last six hours doing software updates on it and now it's ready to go.
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.600]  So I'll get to experience the joy of Android 4.4, I believe. I don't know.
[02:09.600 --> 02:13.360]  I think the Nexus 7 is the current seven inch tablet, isn't it?
[02:13.360 --> 02:21.760]  Well, this one is definitely not because I don't think it runs the KitKat or something.
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.360]  This is definitely a few years old. So maybe there's a new Nexus 7, but this is the first
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.120]  generation. But cool. Good stuff.
[02:35.120 --> 02:39.200]  We can quibble about or talk about, we can probably make a whole show about what the
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.480]  names of these devices are and the problems of the way that some of them are named.
[02:44.480 --> 02:49.200]  Apple, right up there with them, like with the way that they've switched to calling
[02:49.200 --> 02:53.600]  iPad. At one point, they just called it iPad. Now it's just iPad Air and iPad Mini.
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.240]  The new iPad?
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.640]  Right. The new iPad for a while.
[03:00.640 --> 03:04.960]  With Google, it seemed like with the Nexus, they started naming them after their sizes.
[03:04.960 --> 03:09.600]  Like the Nexus 5 is a five inch phone and the Nexus 7 is a seven inch tablet,
[03:10.160 --> 03:14.560]  which is kind of cool while they're new, but then gets confusing.
[03:16.720 --> 03:20.960]  If they come out with a new one like that, it says right here, I'm at the Google site
[03:20.960 --> 03:27.440]  that says Google Nexus 7. So I presume there have been more than one tablet with the name
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.480]  Google Nexus 7.
[03:28.480 --> 03:37.840]  Yeah, I have no idea. And it's funny because Samsung does that with their tablets. They
[03:37.840 --> 03:45.120]  do the size, but then with the phones, they do like the Galaxy S5 goes in order of number
[03:45.120 --> 03:47.200]  of releases like the iPhone.
[03:47.200 --> 03:56.560]  Right. I wonder if we'll see the end. For example, will there be a new phone this year
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.160]  called the iPhone 6 or are they finally going to split to, you know?
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.440]  Yeah, I was just going to ask you that too because the, what is it, Pachkowski report
[04:05.440 --> 04:12.560]  on, was it Friday that the, or sometime this week. Well, now it's two weeks ago, what?
[04:12.560 --> 04:14.400]  Yeah, all right. This month, this month.
[04:14.400 --> 04:20.560]  This month, sometime in August, they report that September is going to be the iPhone event,
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.600]  but no, you know, it doesn't say iPhone 6.
[04:23.600 --> 04:29.520]  Right. Yeah, he would. Who knows? However, however he gets and his stuff on events is
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.480]  gold. I don't think he's ever had a bad report.
[04:32.480 --> 04:33.520]  Oh, I don't think so.
[04:35.040 --> 04:37.440]  But wherever that would be, we'll get to that in a second.
[04:37.440 --> 04:40.880]  Right. Wherever that wherever that comes from, though. I mean, presumably,
[04:40.880 --> 04:47.840]  I always presume that he's got somebody in Apple PR who gives him that stuff. But whoever
[04:47.840 --> 04:51.600]  it is, my guess too, but I have no idea whoever it is, isn't going to give him the name of
[04:51.600 --> 04:57.760]  the product. I don't think they ever deliberately leak a name. They put the date out there just to
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.880]  sort of, you know, they want that out there as sort of, you know, let everybody know what's
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.840]  coming without actually committing to it. Right. They could back out at the last second and
[05:07.840 --> 05:16.080]  Pachkowski looks bad, but the Apple doesn't. Yeah, I mean, I guess it seems weird now,
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.240]  but you remember, like, even the day of the iPad launch, no one really knew it was going
[05:20.240 --> 05:23.600]  to be called like people were doubting that it would be called the iPad.
[05:23.600 --> 05:27.840]  Nope. Yeah, I totally remember that was I think that was one of the names that had been thrown
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.520]  out there. Yeah. Because of what, like a domain registration or something like that.
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.600]  Well, and I think I think some people came up with it naturally just because of iPod.
[05:36.160 --> 05:43.360]  Oh, yeah. And and pad seems like a natural thing for a pad size device. And everybody
[05:43.360 --> 05:48.640]  immediately dismissed it as sounding like tampon or something like a fan. What was your name?
[05:48.640 --> 05:55.280]  It was the the slate or something? No. Oh, I actually glass. No, I forget what I suggested.
[05:55.280 --> 06:02.240]  Wasn't iPad, though. Wasn't glass. No, it wasn't glass. Huh? I forgot tab. Did I suggest I tend
[06:02.240 --> 06:07.120]  now? No, I don't think it had an eye. Yeah, I'm kind of sick of the eyes. Yeah, that's
[06:08.240 --> 06:13.200]  I don't remember the I've actually makes more sense for these things that because I
[06:13.200 --> 06:16.640]  stood for internet, right? Like that was the iMac was the internet man,
[06:16.640 --> 06:21.840]  supposedly. I mean, that's how it was introduced with the iMac is that it was the first Mac built
[06:21.840 --> 06:28.880]  for the internet age. And I think that the iMac was the first I product. Right, it was,
[06:28.880 --> 06:32.960]  you know, but then again, they say it was made for internet, but then the one that really
[06:33.520 --> 06:40.160]  cemented the deal and was a decade long foundation of the company, the iPod didn't get internet
[06:40.160 --> 06:47.680]  access until the iPod touch. Right had nothing to do with the internet. Exactly. But then the iPhone
[06:47.680 --> 06:53.280]  if it's perfectly because that was like the first phone that actually did the internet better than
[06:53.280 --> 06:58.240]  it did the phone. Yeah, I think I think what's happened, though, I think it's never explained
[06:58.240 --> 07:08.640]  never talked about but like the undercurrent is that lowercase I capital product name just means
[07:08.640 --> 07:14.640]  Apple product. That's it. Yeah, it doesn't really have any other connotation other than that just
[07:14.640 --> 07:19.600]  means Apple product. Right, like everyone and everyone calls it the eye touch still.
[07:21.040 --> 07:26.320]  Which Yeah, maybe that's maybe that's what I suggested the iPad maybe I found an old post,
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.320]  but I am not going to read it while I'm talking to you. That's rude. You could do we could edit
[07:30.320 --> 07:36.800]  it out. I don't even know it says it's called the tablet. Yeah, that's the piece that December 31,
[07:36.800 --> 07:42.800]  2009. Yeah, yeah, I don't know if I suggested years post. Well, you say I want to know what
[07:42.800 --> 07:48.240]  Apple refers to it as the tablet. But so far as I can tell, that's blah, blah, blah. Most certainly
[07:48.240 --> 07:56.960]  not the name. Right. I had I had predicted it would be the iPod touch HD, which was, you know,
[07:56.960 --> 08:02.400]  not ultimately not. It's kind of what it is. But that's ultimately not obviously what they called
[08:02.400 --> 08:11.440]  it. I don't remember. I don't know what your Alright, whatever. It doesn't matter. But speaking
[08:11.440 --> 08:19.440]  of those event dates, something weird happened this past week where you like made it you made
[08:19.440 --> 08:25.760]  a typical Jon Gruber offhand comment, you know, seemingly knowing comment about some sort of
[08:25.760 --> 08:31.520]  wrist device coming next month. Well, I was cracking a joke about the Motorola, the Moto
[08:31.520 --> 08:40.160]  270. Watch. Yeah. And how stupid it looks on the side 285. I think we measured it was 270. Okay,
[08:40.160 --> 08:45.840]  I go with 270. I like that sounds good. And you know that the bottom of the circle is cut off,
[08:45.840 --> 08:52.480]  but it charges on its side. And so when you're charging it, it's like the in watch terms, the
[08:52.480 --> 09:01.360]  like eight, nine and 10 o'clock side is cut off. But for some inexplicable reason, even though
[09:01.360 --> 09:08.160]  they cut off that part of the circular display, they decide to show the charge as as a circular
[09:08.160 --> 09:13.360]  meter around the perimeter, which which means that's, you know, somewhere between like 70 when
[09:13.360 --> 09:20.480]  you're in between 70 and 90%, you have no idea whether you're 70 or 90, they just cut it off.
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.360]  And they're shipping it, they're going to ship that product. So I was cracking a joke about
[09:25.360 --> 09:30.960]  that. And I said, I should actually quote it because I guess it's the exact language I chose,
[09:30.960 --> 09:37.120]  which is unfortunate. I wrote, the only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't even ship
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.240]  until after Apple announces their wrist wearable thing next month. And then I'm this is now this
[09:42.240 --> 09:47.120]  is a backstory on this. This is true. You know, my description of the talk show is the director's
[09:47.120 --> 09:56.960]  commentary on during fireball. So here we are, I posted that this is that was Friday. And we,
[09:56.960 --> 10:02.560]  my family and I were in Orlando, Florida after for a week or so of theme park fun.
[10:04.640 --> 10:07.760]  I think I was on my way to the airport. I don't know either on my way to the airport or at the
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.760]  airport when I posted that. And what was your intent? You were just goofing around? Well,
[10:13.760 --> 10:21.200]  I wanted to be like if, if the the watch the wrist thing comes out next month's event,
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.240]  it would be funny if because but motor motor roll is promises that it's going to ship in the summer,
[10:26.240 --> 10:31.680]  which gives them to like September 21. And they haven't announced it yet. And I think it's going
[10:31.680 --> 10:37.280]  to look really, really bad. As soon as Apple unveils whatever it is that they're working on.
[10:37.280 --> 10:41.920]  And I think it's almost certain at this point that Apple is working on something and it's almost
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.720]  certain that it's going to be announced this year. And if it is announced this year,
[10:46.640 --> 10:51.360]  it'll almost certainly be announced either in September or October. I don't know why. Right.
[10:51.360 --> 10:57.440]  And then adding to this was that I don't know if it was published shortly before your post or
[10:57.440 --> 11:06.480]  shortly after, but patch Kowski posted, you know, so citing sources, whatever, that it's going to
[11:06.480 --> 11:12.720]  happen in October period. The wearable thing? Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. I thought he posted
[11:12.720 --> 11:18.320]  that back in June. He updated that. Let me look. I thought he posted that like June 6,
[11:18.960 --> 11:23.520]  that that they were shooting for an October date. Well, maybe that was an old article,
[11:23.520 --> 11:28.720]  but someone I am did to me and they're like, Who do you who's your money on Gruber or or patch?
[11:28.720 --> 11:34.800]  Well, my my money would be on patch Kowski people seem to think I'm I'm more prescient than than
[11:34.800 --> 11:40.160]  than I am. And I know I do know that I have a terrible, terrible guilty habit. I should be I
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.400]  should be guilty about it, but I'm not of when I do have information coily putting it out there
[11:46.400 --> 11:53.200]  without a source as as though it's my own speculation. I mean, this is from June 6. Yeah,
[11:53.200 --> 11:57.440]  it's from June. I got punked. I got punked and played. I thought it was I thought it was
[11:57.440 --> 12:01.680]  published like at the same time as your right. Well, and and if you read it, he didn't say
[12:01.680 --> 12:08.640]  Apple is going to announce it in October his June 6 thing said Apple is shooting for October to
[12:08.640 --> 12:14.000]  release it, you know, meaning, you know, who do you know? Well, it was June. I mean, they still
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.200]  had a lot of work, whatever it is that they're that they're working on June means they still
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.440]  had a lot of work left to do on it. Right. And like in the last several years, they've had
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.840]  basically the September event and the October event. And, you know, right, if it's not ready
[12:29.840 --> 12:34.480]  if it's not ready for September, you can do it in October. But if it is ready, and if it's,
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.040]  you know, this is the kind of thing that is being pitched as an iPhone accessory, basically,
[12:39.600 --> 12:44.240]  then why not show it off in September? I don't know. But well, anyway, read this. If you read
[12:44.240 --> 12:47.920]  the sentence that I wrote, I wrote the only way this could get funnier would be if it doesn't
[12:47.920 --> 12:54.240]  even ship until after Apple announces the wrist wearable thing next month. And then when I wrote
[12:54.240 --> 12:58.720]  that I even thought I should probably put something if they announce it in September
[12:58.720 --> 13:06.640]  instead of October or something like something like that. Yeah. But anything like that takes
[13:06.640 --> 13:11.280]  the piss and vinegar out of the joke. And I didn't write when Apple announces their
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.840]  wrist wearable thing next month, because if that was the clause I was thinking about writing,
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.040]  I would have used if instead of when, yes, Apple announces the wrist wearable thing next month.
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.520]  So and the whole thing is also further complicated that I was doing it from my phone, which makes me
[13:25.520 --> 13:31.920]  lazy. It does. It's it makes me lazier to rewrite a sentence. Whereas if I was at my desk, I might,
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.720]  you know, I did notice that I noticed that someone could read that as me saying that they're
[13:36.720 --> 13:39.920]  definitely going to do it in September. I thought Nah, no one will do that. Everybody knows I'm
[13:39.920 --> 13:47.280]  making a joke about the Moto 360. It's like a two and a half hour flight from Orlando back to Philly
[13:47.280 --> 13:54.880]  and it happened to be a plane with no Wi Fi. So I had no idea I had no Wi Fi. There was a hashtag
[13:54.880 --> 14:01.840]  john it was has Gruber landed and I get off and it had gone like bananas. It was like top of tech
[14:01.840 --> 14:09.120]  meme. John Gruber confirms I watch is going to be released in September. I was like, No, I didn't.
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.920]  More Fridays, man. All right. And then, you know, it's like 10 o'clock on a Friday. And I'm,
[14:15.920 --> 14:20.480]  I guess I should update it. And I thought, Nah, fuck that. I'm not gonna update it because
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.280]  I didn't say that I don't let the other people look foolish for reading too much into it.
[14:25.920 --> 14:32.000]  Yeah. And there's too much it was like too much to update because I do think I'm certain well,
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.120]  not so I'm certain that they're planning to announce it either in September or October.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.480]  I don't know that they will anything can happen at the last minute. But I think that they'll have
[14:42.480 --> 14:50.560]  two events just mainly and this is one thing I often forget is even people who like read my stuff,
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.720]  you know, listen to the I don't know, maybe people listen to the show or more tuned in, but
[14:54.720 --> 15:01.600]  there's so many people who read Darren fireball and follow tech period, but who don't seem to
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.520]  pick up on the very, to me, very obvious patterns of Apple as a company that, you know, I say this
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.400]  or a lot, I repeat myself on this, but they're a company of annual patterns and they do break them.
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.800]  Sometimes, you know, the iPhone used to be a thing the first few years that came out in June
[15:18.080 --> 15:24.400]  or early July, very early July. And then it switched to becoming like a late September thing
[15:24.400 --> 15:29.840]  or announced in early September released two weeks later. And once they switched that, that they
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.960]  stuck to that and they've stuck to it ever since. And last few years they've had a September event
[15:34.960 --> 15:42.160]  with the iPhone and an October event with the iPad. And I just assume that they're probably
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.800]  stick to that this year. And therefore that they've got two events, one of the and if they're
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.760]  going to do the wearable thing, they'll have to pick one of those two events to to, you know,
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.880]  included on. So I, you know, I don't have anybody who's told me that. I don't know. Nobody told me
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.440]  that. I'm just, you know, working it out myself. I do think it's very, in some ways it makes sense.
[16:01.440 --> 16:05.120]  Because the other thing, too, is it's not just that they have to pick one of the two events and
[16:05.120 --> 16:10.080]  find time for it. But their events typically have like a narrative that runs through them.
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.080]  And if they're announcing more than one thing, they figure out some kind of way to tie it
[16:14.080 --> 16:21.520]  together in the show as part of like one story. And I kind of feel like like a wearable wrist
[16:21.520 --> 16:26.720]  thing. Sounds to me like something that would be easier to tie in with new iPhones than with the
[16:26.720 --> 16:34.560]  iPad. Yeah, especially if it requires an iPhone to be used. Right? Well, we can talk about that
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.520]  later. Because that's a question. But I do think, though, that even if or at least if it goes best
[16:39.520 --> 16:46.400]  with them, yeah. And if it's an accessory, if it's a $200 iPhone accessory, you know,
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.600]  show it off with the iPhone. Right. And the the new iPads last year came with the M seven
[16:51.600 --> 16:58.080]  co processor too. But it certainly makes a lot more sense that if the storyline is about health
[16:58.080 --> 17:03.760]  and fitness tracking, right, the health kit, sort of, you know, going health kit expanding
[17:03.760 --> 17:09.040]  from a little 90 second spot during WWDC to here's why we're doing this, you know,
[17:09.760 --> 17:14.400]  90 minute presentation on on health and fitness tracking with a bunch of partners, etc.
[17:15.520 --> 17:18.800]  It seems to me like that would fit more naturally with the iPhone
[17:18.800 --> 17:25.360]  and new iPhones that also have or I guess maybe have an M eight fitness, you know, activity tracker
[17:26.240 --> 17:31.440]  than with the iPad, which, you know, it's I feel like they included the M seven on the iPad,
[17:31.440 --> 17:35.840]  because why not? That's probably not a very expensive component. But I don't think tracking
[17:35.840 --> 17:40.160]  your feet based on your iPad is going to give you you know, your footsteps is going to give you a
[17:40.160 --> 17:46.400]  very accurate count. Right? Yeah, I mean, if it and if it needs any sort of Bluetooth connection
[17:46.400 --> 17:53.360]  to a device to sync to the you know, to your cloud kit, right, or cloud, whatever your iCloud account
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.960]  is, that's most likely going to be an iPhone and not an iPad. Yeah, it probably could technically
[17:58.960 --> 18:04.960]  be an iPad. But my guess is that the majority of people will sync with an iPhone. Right. And
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.280]  further complicating this is Yosemite and not complicating it, I would say almost clarifying
[18:09.280 --> 18:16.640]  it is Yosemite, which last year, the Mac OS 10 update shipped in October, not September.
[18:18.880 --> 18:24.800]  And I think the year before, right? Or maybe not? I don't know. Yeah, I know last year did. And I
[18:24.800 --> 18:30.640]  know this year, it seems to be tracking behind iOS and Mark Gurman of nine to five Mac said it
[18:30.640 --> 18:38.720]  was an it was going to come in October, which makes a lot of sense. And it just doesn't make
[18:38.720 --> 18:44.320]  sense to assuming you know, it also even if it were ready, it just doesn't make sense as part
[18:44.320 --> 18:50.320]  of the iPhone event. Whereas it makes more sense as the iPad event, because iPads and Macs are a
[18:50.320 --> 18:56.080]  little bit more similar overlapping. And so if they're going to do a and that's what they've
[18:56.080 --> 19:03.280]  done the past few years, is sort of repeat the Yosemite thing from WWDC, you know, like, here's
[19:03.280 --> 19:07.840]  these 10 features we think you really want to know about in Yosemite. And, you know, for some of us
[19:07.840 --> 19:12.560]  who pay close attention and remember the WWDC keynote, clearly, it's a little bit of a repeat.
[19:14.080 --> 19:17.360]  But for people who haven't been paying close attention, which is, you know, part of the
[19:17.360 --> 19:21.440]  whole message, you know, whole point of marketing is, you know, to repeat your message to get it
[19:21.440 --> 19:27.360]  through. That's what they do. But I presume that's going to take up a big chunk of the October event.
[19:28.240 --> 19:34.960]  Especially if there's a 12 inch paper thin MacBook Air retina ready to go to. Yeah,
[19:34.960 --> 19:38.720]  but I don't there runs an AA chip. No, that's not gonna happen. Yeah, which I don't expect.
[19:39.360 --> 19:47.440]  So I found a post on Business Insider that says, quote, canvas, a perfect name for Apple tablet
[19:47.440 --> 19:54.480]  says Apple God, John Gruber. I wonder who may have written that post. Oh, that was me. Look at that.
[19:56.480 --> 20:01.120]  Anyway, yeah, canvas. That was the that's that's in hindsight, that sounds stupid.
[20:01.120 --> 20:07.600]  That's why they don't let me name things. But but iPad sounded stupid, too. Yeah.
[20:07.600 --> 20:13.360]  Yeah, maybe they called it canvas. Well, I don't know. I guess the one thing the one thing about
[20:13.360 --> 20:22.080]  iPad in hindsight, is it somehow makes it feel like a sibling to iPhone. In a way that if they
[20:22.080 --> 20:27.040]  called it the one thing iPhone and the other thing canvas that they wouldn't seem like there is
[20:27.040 --> 20:33.520]  aligned. Yeah, and especially, you know, with the notion that they're going to rename iPhone OS to
[20:33.520 --> 20:39.360]  iOS, to think was was that before that I was after app because it would have been a giveaway before.
[20:40.560 --> 20:48.640]  Well, the iPod touch but yeah. Oh, yeah, but they still called it. I they never seemed to hesitate
[20:48.640 --> 20:57.920]  to to to make it clear that the iPod touch despite its name was an iPhone without a phone. Yeah,
[20:57.920 --> 21:07.920]  iPhone OS four named renamed iOS for 2010. Right. So yeah, that's true. I mean, and and circling
[21:07.920 --> 21:12.560]  back to what you said of, you know, back 10 minutes ago, you know, it's true that nobody
[21:12.560 --> 21:20.080]  knows not only do people not know the name of the first iPad in 2010. Nobody even really knew
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.920]  there was no confirmation no leaks that it ran iPhone what was then called iPhone OS.
[21:26.880 --> 21:33.840]  Like I sent a footnote on my piece, the tablet where I wrote I would not be surprised to find
[21:33.840 --> 21:40.000]  out that the tablet uses UI kit aka cocoa touch as its programming API. Like I kind of thought it
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.160]  would because it seemed to make sense to me but not I didn't nobody knew. There weren't any kind
[21:44.160 --> 21:55.360]  of leaked nothing leaked out of them. My favorite was an article I think from Nick Bilton where he
[21:55.360 --> 22:04.800]  said that the tablet interface would surprise you. It was basically like, get ready for a big
[22:04.800 --> 22:11.760]  surprise about you will be very surprised by how you interact with a new tablet. I don't know,
[22:11.760 --> 22:15.200]  which is like, I don't know who told him that that doesn't seem I don't know. It doesn't seem
[22:15.200 --> 22:22.320]  my illustration was was a woman with a with a crazy brain helmet on like a brain measurement.
[22:24.320 --> 22:29.280]  That would have been a very apt description for the original iPhone. But yeah, not, you know,
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.680]  it was in fact, I guess it's really could really say it's wrong given how many people came out of
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.480]  the iPad intro with. I can't believe we got all excited for that. It's just a big iPhone.
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.160]  Exactly. Yeah. And actually did a roundup before the iPad was announced of kind of
[22:46.160 --> 22:55.280]  artist renderings of what it might look like. And there's actually one that looks exactly like the
[22:55.280 --> 23:04.240]  current iPad mini by Jesus Diaz of Gizmodo. Oh, yes. It looks exactly like today's iPad mini.
[23:06.080 --> 23:11.840]  It did not look like the first iPad, but it was kind of funny. So some of those renderings of
[23:13.120 --> 23:20.400]  whatever the iWatch is going to be called might be somewhat accurate someday in the future,
[23:20.400 --> 23:25.760]  but I don't know. Yeah, I do wonder about that. I do. I heard one thing. Well, you know what,
[23:25.760 --> 23:32.640]  let me take a break about first concert and we'll get back to it. Let me tell you about our good
[23:32.640 --> 23:40.880]  friends at Backblaze. You guys know Backblaze. They are online backup, unlimited, unthrottled
[23:40.880 --> 23:48.160]  for your Mac computer. You sign up for Backblaze, you install their software, which was written
[23:48.160 --> 23:52.880]  by ex-Apple engineers. Totally cool, very nice native Mac software, little thing in system
[23:52.880 --> 23:58.960]  preferences, set it up. It stays out of your way, just runs in the background and then everything
[23:58.960 --> 24:06.480]  on your Mac, even external drives you have plugged in just backs up to Backblaze's online hosted
[24:07.360 --> 24:12.800]  servers. It takes a while for the first backup, especially depending on your upstream thing.
[24:12.800 --> 24:16.240]  There's no getting around that. It might take a while. It might take a couple of days,
[24:16.240 --> 24:19.680]  maybe even a week, depending on how much stuff you have to get that up there. After that,
[24:19.680 --> 24:27.440]  everything's incremental, just stays backed up. Then you can do whatever you want. You can
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.800]  restore one file at a time. You can restore all your files, disaster strikes, or you're
[24:32.800 --> 24:38.160]  across the country, but need your whole system. You don't know what to do. You can get them to
[24:38.880 --> 24:42.400]  put your whole backup on an external drive. You have to pay for it, but then they'll ship it
[24:42.400 --> 24:48.240]  right to you. Get it all right back in your hands right away. They have iPhone app so you can access
[24:48.240 --> 24:54.000]  and share any of your files from wherever you are. You don't have to tunnel through anything to get
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.240]  to your own Mac. Your Mac could be sleeping in your backpack offline. You can just use your
[24:58.240 --> 25:04.240]  iPhone and access Backblaze's stuff and get any one file that you need, send it off, send it off
[25:04.240 --> 25:13.760]  from the iPhone app. Great, great software. You get a risk-free, no credit card required trial.
[25:13.760 --> 25:18.320]  Nothing's wrong, I don't think, with a credit card required trial, but of course it's better
[25:18.320 --> 25:22.000]  without one because when you put your credit card in, you think, that means if I forget,
[25:22.560 --> 25:25.680]  when the trial's up, they're going to start charging me. No, you don't have to worry about
[25:25.680 --> 25:32.640]  that. You just sign up, no credit card required trial at backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball
[25:32.640 --> 25:36.800]  and get started. You get a whole month to see how it works and I guarantee it by the end of that,
[25:36.800 --> 25:38.880]  you'll be giving them your credit card. You're going to want to sign up.
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.000]  And the whole thing, it's five bucks a month, five bucks a month for each Mac that you want
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.800]  to have in your Backblaze account. It's the best deal I've ever heard of for online backup.
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.280]  So my thanks to them. Remember, go to backblaze.com slash Daring Fireball.
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.440]  They keep sponsoring the show because people keep signing up. I can't believe everybody
[26:01.440 --> 26:07.760]  hasn't signed up already. I actually have a Backblaze pro tip because the first time I,
[26:08.480 --> 26:12.160]  you know, that first sync obviously is going to take a long time because there's whatever,
[26:12.160 --> 26:17.440]  a terabyte of data, but it was going so unbelievably slow. I didn't know what was
[26:17.440 --> 26:22.400]  wrong. It was like, you know, would maybe do a hundred meg a day. And it turned out that my
[26:22.400 --> 26:29.280]  stupid iMac was falling asleep after whatever, 10 minutes each time. And that was interrupting the
[26:29.280 --> 26:35.440]  upload process somehow. So I turned sleep off and boom, it was done in like two days.
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.240]  Yeah. Just have it set to display to sleep your monitor.
[26:38.240 --> 26:44.240]  Yeah. So, and maybe it's cause it's an old, old ass iMac that, you know,
[26:45.200 --> 26:51.760]  with the spinning hard drive and all that stuff. But try that if, if it's, if you need it to speed
[26:51.760 --> 26:59.920]  up, I have heard one whisper, I mean, and this is horribly, this is like third party, third hand,
[27:01.120 --> 27:06.560]  just something floating in the wind, but that the, whatever the wearable thing that they have
[27:07.200 --> 27:12.800]  coming out that it has a square display. Hmm. I don't even, I would, so I would,
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.160]  so it has a display. That's what I've heard that it has a display, which to me is interesting if
[27:18.160 --> 27:22.640]  it's true. Cause that implies a lot of things I think. Cause if it has a display to me,
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.840]  that means it's gonna, it, maybe it is more of a watch type thing. I've declined to call it a
[27:27.840 --> 27:34.240]  watch and I've certainly declined to call it the iWatch. I'm not because I know that it is not a
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.880]  watch and I've seen people on Twitter speculate on that, that I call it a risk wearable thing.
[27:40.880 --> 27:44.560]  That doesn't mean that I know that it's not a watch. It just means that I don't know what
[27:44.560 --> 27:48.560]  the heck it is. And I don't know that it is a watch. I just know that they're working on a
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.200]  risk wearable thing, but I've heard that it has a square display. Hmm. Well, I think that,
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.640]  I think it kind of has to, I don't know. I've those mock-ups that you see where people make
[28:00.640 --> 28:06.880]  it like the whole band is a flexible display and it's a lot of it is display. They look cool as a,
[28:08.480 --> 28:13.440]  as a mock-up, but I think they're problematic if you think about it in practical terms,
[28:13.440 --> 28:18.000]  because which way are they oriented? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like if, you know,
[28:18.000 --> 28:24.080]  you've seen those mock-ups, but if it's just a band and like the whole top half of it is a color
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.920]  display to get a lot of texts, you'd have to turn your wrist sideways. Otherwise you just have a
[28:29.920 --> 28:36.560]  real skinny display. That's real tall. I even had some stupid ideas where like the display part
[28:36.560 --> 28:44.480]  pops out and you can spin it. That doesn't make any sense. But yeah, I don't know. So I don't
[28:44.480 --> 28:51.520]  know. I remember the last time I talked to you about this, but I did a story a few weeks ago
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.240]  for courts where I dug up every Apple wearable that they've ever shipped and posted photos of
[28:58.240 --> 29:06.160]  it, you know, dating back to the old iPod remote, which clipped onto your shirt. And actually my
[29:06.160 --> 29:10.880]  favorite were the Sony mini disc remote controls, which I didn't, I don't think I posted in the
[29:10.880 --> 29:15.440]  article, but they were awesome. Um, they had like little display on them and they clipped right
[29:15.440 --> 29:20.800]  onto your shirt. Uh, but then also Apple, you know, has done obviously earbuds and the iPod
[29:20.800 --> 29:25.920]  shuffle series, including, you know, three or four different designs of the iPod shuffle,
[29:25.920 --> 29:33.440]  including one that they kind of screwed up and had to revert course. And, and then of course the,
[29:33.440 --> 29:41.680]  the last one was the iPod nano, which people made watch bands for. Yeah. Not the current iPod nano
[29:42.960 --> 29:50.000]  previous iPod. Yeah. I've got one of those in my hand right now. Yeah. Which, which is surprisingly
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.640]  similar, obviously, you know, many years have passed and technology's improved, but those like
[29:54.640 --> 30:02.480]  LG and Samsung watches just seem like they're that. And I don't know, maybe Apple was like,
[30:02.480 --> 30:07.280]  Oh, this is brilliant. Let's, uh, let's shift course on the iPod nano and we'll,
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.200]  we'll come back to this watch thing and make it look just like this in a few years.
[30:12.160 --> 30:16.560]  But I don't know, you know, it seems to me like if that was the right course of action,
[30:16.560 --> 30:22.960]  they would have just kept with it. I think it was called the TikTok T I K T O K. It was a,
[30:22.960 --> 30:30.400]  it was an early kickstarter and huge success, a watch band to fit the, this little,
[30:30.400 --> 30:35.760]  the little square nano. I have it. I have one right here. And I believe Apple later sold them
[30:35.760 --> 30:39.520]  in this, in their store. They did sell them, I think. And I think other companies came out
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.960]  with them. I don't think anybody had the success that these guys had, but I've said to people
[30:42.960 --> 30:50.080]  before, like when I see these Android wear devices coming out, that if they don't look better than
[30:50.720 --> 30:56.400]  the TikTok, which, you know, the, the, the iPod nano combined with the TikTok,
[30:56.400 --> 31:02.560]  which is a device that wasn't even designed to be a watch, then that's a problem. Yeah. Like if you
[31:02.560 --> 31:07.760]  can't, if you can't make a watch that looks better than a device that wasn't really designed to be a
[31:07.760 --> 31:13.440]  watch that could be made into one by a Kickstarter four years ago, four years ago or whatever it was
[31:13.440 --> 31:19.200]  three or four years ago. Yeah. Uh, and that's, you know, the, the round screen, like maybe that's
[31:19.200 --> 31:27.200]  progress, but, but just everything about iOS and obviously macOS are, has been built on, you know,
[31:27.200 --> 31:33.680]  screens with corners and a top and a bottom and that kind of stuff. And like, if you see how,
[31:33.680 --> 31:40.800]  how hard it's been just to get people to make iPad apps, uh, I don't know about getting,
[31:40.800 --> 31:46.480]  you know, having everyone rethink everything again for a round. Well, round makes sense given
[31:46.480 --> 31:53.120]  traditional watches and clocks where you're, you've got this radial dial of, you know, minute
[31:53.120 --> 31:58.480]  and hour and second hands that sweep around in a circle. It, it makes sense. You're showing circular
[31:58.480 --> 32:04.240]  dials. It makes sense to put it in a circle. That's the reason why, um, all sorts of things
[32:04.240 --> 32:12.720]  that use a dial, like a speedometer in a car, you know, the, the tachometer in a car have crop circle,
[32:12.720 --> 32:19.760]  crop circles, sundials, uh, have, you know, traditionally been or often are circles,
[32:20.560 --> 32:25.280]  but you know, for everything else it does it circles are pretty problematic as a display,
[32:25.280 --> 32:30.000]  like for displaying text of any kind, because you only get the full width right at the,
[32:30.560 --> 32:34.400]  I don't know, the, what would you call it? The equator. Yeah. Yeah. Unless you have,
[32:34.400 --> 32:40.080]  you're supposed to read it, uh, in a, in a spiral or something. Right. Laying out text in a circle
[32:40.080 --> 32:46.800]  is incredibly inefficient. Yeah. Um, yeah. So when you say square, do you literally mean square?
[32:46.800 --> 32:53.520]  Do you mean rectangular? No, I mean square, like, you know, like the iPod nano. Interesting.
[32:54.320 --> 32:58.160]  I, you know, again, this, I mean, you can, I don't know, there's probably another freaking
[32:58.160 --> 33:04.160]  bullshit thing that business insider is going to Gruber says iPod nano is a square. Should we,
[33:04.160 --> 33:08.080]  should we write it right now? I might still have a login. I don't know. It should say,
[33:08.080 --> 33:14.800]  if it wanted to be honest, I should say Gruber says sketchy third hand source. Here's whisper
[33:14.800 --> 33:21.840]  that apple wearable thing might have square display. Yeah. Uh, I don't see that. I don't
[33:21.840 --> 33:28.160]  know. I don't know. I wouldn't bet money on it. Well, I'd bet a little now. Okay. Not much. I
[33:28.160 --> 33:34.080]  wouldn't bet big. I would bet big that there will be, there will be some wearable thing
[33:34.080 --> 33:39.920]  unveiled in September or October. I would bet an extra $5 that it would have a square display.
[33:42.400 --> 33:48.560]  I can see that. All right. Anyway, I'm on that side too. So the biggest implication to me of it
[33:48.560 --> 33:56.400]  having a display is battery life because the battery having a display to me is means that it's
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.320]  going to leads to all sorts of questions about how the, how is this thing going to have
[34:00.320 --> 34:07.920]  a usable battery life? Yeah, because that is the one nice thing about this Nexus seven is that it's
[34:07.920 --> 34:16.320]  already told me that over half of the power I've consumed is the screen. Yeah. Does the iOS eight
[34:16.320 --> 34:20.960]  tell you that? I don't remember something like that. You know what? They have an app shaming
[34:20.960 --> 34:27.280]  feature, but I don't think that like, like Android has had that for a while and will tell you things
[34:27.280 --> 34:34.400]  that aren't just based on the app, but things like cellular networking in general and the display,
[34:34.400 --> 34:41.920]  just the power display. I think that the iOS eight feature only lists apps by the order that,
[34:41.920 --> 34:50.320]  which in which they've consumed energy. Yeah. Yeah. So 58% of my Nexus seven energy consumption
[34:50.320 --> 34:55.840]  has been the screen today. I have a feeling that that app shaming feature and I always say,
[34:55.840 --> 35:02.640]  I think it's improved popular. Um, I think it's also going to cause some weird problems. I think
[35:02.640 --> 35:07.680]  part of it is because people are going to be surprised by what's using power. Um, I've heard,
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.600]  I don't use Facebook, so I don't know, but I've heard from a lot of people that facebook.app
[35:11.600 --> 35:19.440]  uses, consumes an unseemly amount of energy based on, uh, the default settings for background,
[35:19.440 --> 35:24.480]  like stuff that it tries to, Oh yeah. Interesting. Well, that's good then. So I think,
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.440]  I think it might, it might even be a big reason why app, because of course, you know,
[35:29.440 --> 35:34.640]  in combination with the fact that it uses a lot of power, it's on a lot of iPhones and people who
[35:34.640 --> 35:38.880]  probably more than any other app. That's a good question. I thought about that with the Google
[35:38.880 --> 35:46.000]  sponsorship of, of daring fireball for iOS apps. Um, because clearly if you, you know,
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.880]  some of Google's apps or are inordinately popular, Google maps, uh, is I would guess the most popular
[35:52.880 --> 35:57.840]  of the Google app. Right. But you know, I would think so, you know, but, uh, a bunch of their
[35:57.840 --> 36:03.760]  apps are very popular. Gmail's their Gmail app is super popular. Yeah. There's search app. Yeah.
[36:03.760 --> 36:08.960]  Which I think was their first app maybe. Yeah. I think the one that's just called Google and
[36:08.960 --> 36:16.400]  it's the one that gives you the Google now functionality. Um, um, but clearly with the
[36:16.400 --> 36:21.200]  Google app, with certain of Google's apps, you can reach a lot more people than our YouTube is
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.760]  probably maybe a number one. Maybe YouTube is number one. Oh, I don't know. Cause for so long
[36:25.760 --> 36:30.240]  it was a system app and then everyone had to re get it. Oh, I don't know. Or at least on certain
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.040]  contingent of people, it's gotta be number one. Like, you know, Mike, Mike, I'm going to guess
[36:35.040 --> 36:40.080]  Facebook is the all time number one. Yeah. I would, if I had to bet on what's the most popular app
[36:40.080 --> 36:46.080]  of all, which app is on the highest percentage of iPhones and use, I would say Facebook. So if
[36:46.080 --> 36:52.160]  that is really a huge power suck, then we're going to hear about it. Although, you know,
[36:52.160 --> 36:59.280]  there is a difference between consumption and well, the, the bandwidth example is another one.
[36:59.280 --> 37:07.760]  So I just did a post on Friday where I, uh, revealed the, where the last 6.8 gigs of my
[37:07.760 --> 37:16.000]  cellular data have gone. And the biggest, uh, the biggest source was Twitter, Twitter, which, you
[37:16.000 --> 37:24.400]  know, you think of as a simple 140 character text app used over two gigabytes of data for me in the
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.800]  last few months. Um, which is kind of surprising. And you know, of course a lot of that is photos
[37:30.800 --> 37:36.160]  and built in web browser or that kind of stuff. But yeah, I never would have guessed that Twitter
[37:36.160 --> 37:42.720]  was my number one bandwidth hog. Um, and actually I asked quartz readers to fill out a survey
[37:43.600 --> 37:49.440]  of their number one app, uh, that uses the most cellular bandwidth. And I'm gonna do a writeup
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.680]  of, of those findings too. But a lot of them, I looked at them so far. A lot of them also say
[37:53.680 --> 38:01.040]  tweet bot and yeah. And Twitter. So, well, it is the case with my, um, my iOS eight phone,
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.720]  I'm using my iOS eight this summer on the betas on my year old iPhone five that every time I go,
[38:06.720 --> 38:12.720]  you go to settings, general usage, battery usage, and it shows you if you wait a couple seconds,
[38:12.720 --> 38:20.320]  it lists your apps by battery usage. Tweet bot is number one for me, but I know how much I use
[38:20.320 --> 38:26.560]  Twitter when I'm on my phone. And that includes like when I tap a link, most of the time I just
[38:26.560 --> 38:32.480]  read it right there in tweet bots, built in browser. Totally. And I'll use it to watch
[38:32.480 --> 38:38.640]  videos too. And you know, it's not just the actual tweets that I'm reading the way that on iOS,
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.520]  you load the web pages and videos and stuff by default in the Twitter client contributes to that.
[38:43.520 --> 38:50.480]  So, um, based on my, you know, and I don't know exactly how much I use tweet bot, but my hunch
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.440]  is that their battery, you know, their, their number one ranking in the battery usage
[38:55.440 --> 39:00.480]  is totally fair. And it's in a completely in line with how much I use tweet bot,
[39:00.480 --> 39:03.920]  but I suspect that there's going to be a lot of people. And I even saw, I think Paul,
[39:03.920 --> 39:10.960]  I think it was Paul Haddad from the app bots or tweet bot, whatever their company name is, tap
[39:10.960 --> 39:19.600]  bots. Um, what did I call it? App bots. And that would work too. Uh, tap bots. Uh, he,
[39:19.600 --> 39:23.760]  he even said back right after the feature was announced in WWDC that he's dreading it because
[39:23.760 --> 39:28.960]  he knows, you know, that they're gonna, you know, they're gonna get blamed for, Hey, you know,
[39:28.960 --> 39:33.840]  my iPhone says tweet bots using the most power. Right. No, actually you're just a Twitter addict.
[39:33.840 --> 39:39.040]  And that's, uh, that's how it works. Yeah. But it's, so Facebook is using a lot of power in the
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.760]  background though. That's, you know, that's potentially problematic. And other, and I
[39:43.760 --> 39:50.320]  actually think I've turned off background app refresh for Facebook and location services.
[39:50.320 --> 39:56.960]  Um, and a lot of like the new four square app too is always polling your location. I turned
[39:56.960 --> 40:00.720]  all that stuff off. Yeah. There was a thing I linked to, maybe it was months ago now,
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.360]  but I know it was a couple of weeks ago where it was a former Apple genius posting a top 10.
[40:05.360 --> 40:10.320]  Here's how to get more battery from your iPhone. And like number one was turn off everything for
[40:10.320 --> 40:16.160]  Facebook in the background. Totally. But it doesn't think that there, I think someone was saying how
[40:16.160 --> 40:21.040]  they did that. And then there, the percentage went up maybe even on the show. I don't know.
[40:21.040 --> 40:26.080]  I don't know. I do know. I just checked on my beta iPhone that it doesn't list anything like
[40:26.080 --> 40:32.240]  that screen or anything like that. It's all, it's just a list of apps. Hmm. But anyway,
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.840]  I do think though that the, if it has a screen and it sounds to me like it probably does that,
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.560]  that it, unless Apple has invented some kind of new technology, which I wouldn't put past them,
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.160]  but that it could mean that it's like a, in the best case, you've got to charge it every
[40:48.160 --> 40:56.560]  couple of days thing. Yeah. I also met with a guy not long ago who makes chips for wearable devices
[40:56.560 --> 41:02.640]  and some of the stuff that is going on there is interesting too, like chips that generate power
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.680]  based on motion and that kind of stuff. Right. Which is an old idea from the watch world,
[41:07.680 --> 41:14.080]  right? Where automatic watches, uh, which have been around, I think they came out in the fifties,
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.600]  but I think they were sort of a novelty. But then by the sixties, you know, a lot of high end,
[41:17.600 --> 41:22.400]  most high end wristwatches were, you know, could come, you know, came with an automatic movement,
[41:22.400 --> 41:29.600]  which meant that once wound, if you wore it, just the motion of going through the day would keep
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.240]  the, I forget what it's called the wellspring, uh, something like that, some kind of spring,
[41:34.240 --> 41:40.560]  keep it wound. So as long as you keep wearing the watch, it'll stay wound. Right. I once bought a
[41:40.560 --> 41:45.920]  watch that was powered by water and that was stupid. Uh, that didn't work very well. What
[41:45.920 --> 41:50.800]  do you mean? Are you serious? Yeah. Like there was, there was, you just like put water on it
[41:50.800 --> 41:57.760]  and then it would supposedly shock itself maybe. And it would work. It was awful. It barely,
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.080]  you know, it didn't really work. I'm imagining something like the Mr. Fusion drive from back
[42:02.080 --> 42:08.560]  to the future where it like, yeah, right. Yeah. It's like, yeah, it's like trying to power a
[42:08.560 --> 42:14.080]  light bulb with a potato or something. It just, you know, right. But the watch world long
[42:14.080 --> 42:22.640]  recognized that even just daily winding your watch was a pain in the ass. And so, you know,
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.680]  I think that the effort that went into designing automatic movements, it's to me, fascinating to
[42:27.680 --> 42:33.200]  me. It's exactly like, you know, it's like the, I think the type of minds even today that go into
[42:33.200 --> 42:39.600]  like being like, uh, you know, mechanical watchmaker or someone who repairs it is a lot
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.280]  like being a programmer because you're thinking of, you know, if this, you know, the gear moves
[42:45.280 --> 42:51.200]  this way, it'll do this. And 60 times a minute, it'll do this. And, you know, it's the same sort
[42:51.200 --> 42:56.080]  of logical mindset that, that required for computer programming. And I think coming up
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.760]  with these automatic movements that never need to be wound, so long as you keep wearing them
[43:00.400 --> 43:03.440]  took an enormous amount of work. But I think it's because they recognize that
[43:04.000 --> 43:08.160]  daily, every day waking up and having to wind your watch was, you know, keeping people from
[43:08.160 --> 43:14.640]  wearing watches. Yeah. And is, you know, how many charging stations do you need by your next year
[43:14.640 --> 43:20.720]  bed now? I mean, you know, that, that Motorola watch thing did not look like the kind of thing
[43:20.720 --> 43:25.360]  I'd want to have to deal with every day or two. Right. And there's so many questions like a device
[43:25.360 --> 43:28.560]  you have to charge comes with so many things. Number one, just how many devices you have to
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.240]  charge on a regular basis. Like it's asking a lot. Each even asking for one is a lot like there
[43:34.240 --> 43:40.800]  could come a time 20 or 30 years from now where we look back on having to charge anything on a
[43:40.800 --> 43:47.760]  regular basis as laughable. Right. And yet at the same time now we've, I mean, I don't have to charge
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.400]  my iPad every day, but I certainly have to charge my iPhone every day. And even then it's like,
[43:52.400 --> 43:57.840]  that means every time I travel, I've got to take a charger. All right. So the clasp of the watch is
[43:57.840 --> 44:06.480]  the lightning port plug. Yeah. You know, that's, it raises a question. No, but like is, is lightning,
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.080]  are lightning ports waterproof? I've heard some people speculate that they are, you know,
[44:12.080 --> 44:18.960]  that the one reason phones, the iPhone still isn't waterproof is the audio port and the phones that
[44:18.960 --> 44:24.160]  claim to be, I don't know. I think that a traditional audio port can't be made waterproof.
[44:24.160 --> 44:30.880]  People correct me if I'm wrong. But that lightning in theory could be, but Apple doesn't advertise
[44:30.880 --> 44:34.240]  it as such because the iPhone isn't water resistant. So they just don't want to get
[44:34.240 --> 44:40.160]  into that. But the lightning port could be, um, but a lightning port on a watch would be ugly.
[44:41.200 --> 44:47.840]  Yeah. I mean, that's just, yeah. The Nike fuel ban has this weird thing where the, the lock,
[44:47.840 --> 44:55.840]  locking clasp type thing is part of the charging system. Right. So yeah, I guess if the, if they,
[44:55.840 --> 45:02.400]  but you still needed like a little dock for it and it wasn't, wasn't great. Right. So I guess if
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.080]  you hit it somewhere else on the watch, on the band somewhere, yeah, maybe you could do it,
[45:06.080 --> 45:09.840]  put it somewhere where it's, you know, when you have it off, you're, I've exposed, but when it's
[45:09.840 --> 45:14.320]  on, you don't see it. It could be something clever like that. But even then, even if it's a lightning
[45:14.320 --> 45:20.960]  port, you're still asking people who, you know, if to have another lightning port at their bedside.
[45:22.080 --> 45:25.040]  Right. And another one that you take with you when you travel.
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.360]  Uh, yeah. And there's also like this wireless charging stuff, but it seems like it's still
[45:33.360 --> 45:38.480]  several years away from so wireless charging ports are in or, or I guess it's not a port,
[45:38.480 --> 45:42.400]  but wireless charging is interesting because then you don't have an ugly port on the device.
[45:42.400 --> 45:46.400]  Right. But then you've got to have a dock that you take with you everywhere. You got to have
[45:46.400 --> 45:50.400]  one wherever you want to charge it. And so if you have one bedside and then when you travel,
[45:50.400 --> 45:54.640]  what do you do? Do you take your, take your one with you or do you buy, have to buy a second one
[45:55.360 --> 46:01.680]  for $50 and keep it in your suit. It's not ready. I mean, someday it'll be built into
[46:01.680 --> 46:07.280]  all kinds of stuff. Like I think Starbucks is rolling out a new tables that have them
[46:07.280 --> 46:13.520]  built into the table or something. Yeah. But it's going to take way too long before that's even
[46:13.520 --> 46:20.080]  right. So I don't know if it, if it was a device without a screen, I could see how Apple could have
[46:20.080 --> 46:25.520]  something in, you know, a lot of inventive stuff to keep power usage down and maybe, you know,
[46:25.520 --> 46:31.840]  like you said, like kinetic motion so that you could use that to charge it. Um, I have a,
[46:31.840 --> 46:39.120]  a citizen watch from a couple of years ago that has a, they call it eco drive, E C O dash D R I V E.
[46:40.000 --> 46:47.040]  It's a quartz watch battery operated, but the battery recharges, um, with a solar
[46:48.480 --> 46:53.600]  cell that's on the face of the watch and what you can hardly see, like in certain light,
[46:53.600 --> 47:01.520]  you can see that it's not really a black dial. It's, it's got like a slightly not black in the
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.400]  center of it because it's actually a solar cell and it's worked great. The watch keeps perfect
[47:06.400 --> 47:11.280]  time and I've never needed to replace the battery way, you know, way past the time when you'd have
[47:11.280 --> 47:17.680]  to replace a regular quartz watch battery. But I don't think there's much, you know, I think it,
[47:17.680 --> 47:23.120]  you know, using solar to charge something that only tells the time and the day of the month
[47:23.920 --> 47:30.080]  is a far cry from even a no display fitness tracker. That's going to have Bluetooth and,
[47:30.080 --> 47:34.400]  you know, other types of things like that. Yeah. And the minute you add the Instagram app,
[47:35.440 --> 47:39.840]  all bets are off. But if it has a display, I think some kind of magical charging,
[47:40.480 --> 47:44.880]  seemingly magical charging that doesn't need you to charge it in every couple of days is out of the
[47:44.880 --> 47:49.520]  question. I think if it has a display, it's gotta be something you charge every couple of days at
[47:49.520 --> 47:55.280]  least. And then that means to me that it has to be far more compelling in terms of what it does.
[47:55.280 --> 48:02.960]  Yeah. You know, to get people to buy into the hassle of buying another daily or near daily
[48:03.600 --> 48:08.720]  charging device, it's gotta be way more compelling than something that, Hey, just buy this, you know,
[48:08.720 --> 48:11.760]  put on your wrist and it'll just work for weeks until you need to charge it.
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.120]  Do you think it has a headphone jack? Oh, probably not. If it needs to be water resistant,
[48:17.120 --> 48:20.480]  right. I think anything you put on your wrist has to be water resistant. Yeah. And you know,
[48:20.480 --> 48:26.160]  especially remember those old watches that had like a built-in AM radio. Right. And I got very
[48:26.160 --> 48:31.040]  excited about that, that idea of listening to baseball game, you know, without needing
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.800]  anything else, but not very practical. Also, you look like a moron with earbuds coming off your
[48:38.800 --> 48:43.280]  wrist. Yeah, you do. And that's actually the reason I bought the Tik TOK is I thought, Hey,
[48:43.280 --> 48:50.080]  this would be great. I can use, then I can wear my nano on my wrist when I run, but yeah,
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.560]  somehow it's, it's way too, I found it way worse. And then my arm was always getting tangled in the
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.640]  cord compared to compare to arm bands, like kind of work. But, um, you know, a lot of people run
[49:00.640 --> 49:04.720]  with the arm arm band around your bicep or something, but they were all the way down
[49:04.720 --> 49:08.160]  your wrist. Right. It's because it's all the way down your wrist. Yeah. It doesn't work out as
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.880]  well. I think that if it somehow broadcasts audio, it has to be over Bluetooth. Yeah. Yeah.
[49:12.880 --> 49:20.240]  Yeah. Oh, right. The, uh, the, uh, Bluetooth ear pods that were someone made up the, uh, the fake
[49:21.040 --> 49:25.680]  secret about those. Oh, you're right on the secret app. Somebody posted a,
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.000]  yeah, I don't think we, I don't know if I ever talked about it on the show because it happened
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.680]  at WWDC, which it was like right before or something. No, it was while I was in San
[49:35.680 --> 49:40.800]  Francisco for WWDC and it was, it's such a busy hectic week for me, but yeah, there was a,
[49:40.800 --> 49:45.360]  that again, I think top of tech meme, it was like an anonymous post on secret that somebody who had
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.320]  been on the, uh, wireless headphones team was just let go from Apple and that, and that the
[49:50.320 --> 49:53.760]  whole team had been let go and that they were so bitter that they were going to spoil it.
[49:54.640 --> 50:00.320]  Yeah. Right. And there are wireless headphones, you know, coming out for new devices this fall.
[50:00.320 --> 50:05.280]  And then like a couple of after everybody had taken it as, Oh, this anonymous post on secret,
[50:05.280 --> 50:10.320]  it must be true or is probably true or is at least worth reporting. Then a couple of days later,
[50:10.320 --> 50:16.800]  the same guy was like, Hey, I'm sorry. I made the whole thing up. Yeah. Just great. You know,
[50:17.840 --> 50:22.880]  it's plausible, but no, it wasn't plausible. I forget the exact details of it, but it wasn't
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.960]  plausible because it doesn't, it didn't make any sense. Wireless earbuds are kind of plausible. Oh
[50:26.960 --> 50:30.960]  yeah. But it didn't make any sense that Apple would disband the team. No, no. If they were
[50:30.960 --> 50:35.440]  successful at designing, I mean, like if they had failed to design the headphones, maybe that got,
[50:35.440 --> 50:38.960]  people would get fired because, Hey, we told you to design wireless headphones and you didn't do
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.880]  it. But if they did, the point of the post was that we did and that they're coming out and they're
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.400]  pretty cool. And it's like, well then why, why would Apple fire you? Yeah. Apple doesn't get it.
[50:48.400 --> 50:54.640]  You get a promotion and you take over everything. Right. But it was, it was like a complete,
[50:55.600 --> 50:58.880]  no company. It's not like, Oh, Apple's the one company that does that. What company,
[50:58.880 --> 51:05.760]  what same company would fire? I grew up around myself. My, but congratulations on just
[51:05.760 --> 51:10.880]  successfully. Well, I would be as part of Microsoft might as part of a downsizing, right?
[51:10.880 --> 51:15.040]  They've announced that they've got to lay people off to, they want to reduce headcount. Apple's not
[51:15.040 --> 51:20.240]  having a layoff. No, although it was a little interesting that they got rid of so many people
[51:20.240 --> 51:27.200]  for beats, but I guess those were not like the core people that they acquired the company for.
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.040]  So it certainly wasn't why they required the company. Right. Right. I wonder if there,
[51:33.040 --> 51:37.920]  if that's going to be something they talk about yet in September slash October,
[51:37.920 --> 51:43.760]  or if it's too soon for that, like a, you know, any sort of new stuff from beats,
[51:43.760 --> 51:49.840]  new stuff from beats. So one thing I'd love, uh, is an Apple TV app because none of the
[51:49.840 --> 51:55.600]  other subscription music services have one. And that'd be, you know, a reason for me to
[51:55.600 --> 52:00.320]  think about using beats is if I could, I never thought about it from the, from the TV. Yeah.
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.360]  I was thinking the other day, because, you know, I have my whole iTunes match library available
[52:05.360 --> 52:12.160]  there and wanted to use that to play music when we had some people over and, you know,
[52:12.160 --> 52:17.360]  we're like, Oh, there's no Spotify app on the, or RDO app on the Apple TV. It'd be awesome if
[52:18.400 --> 52:24.720]  they kicked one out pretty quickly for beats, but it might be asking too much. It's only,
[52:24.720 --> 52:29.680]  I think the deal just closed like a couple of weeks ago. So yeah, I wonder about that.
[52:29.680 --> 52:35.680]  And I wonder, I wonder too, how it ties into whether or not, and I, you know, again,
[52:35.680 --> 52:41.440]  this is pure speculation, but whether or not there's a major Apple TV update coming soon,
[52:42.800 --> 52:47.440]  you know, even if it's, well, isn't there like a beta one with it with a slightly refreshed
[52:47.440 --> 52:51.440]  look or something? No, I don't know about that. I don't know if it has a new look. If there is,
[52:51.440 --> 52:56.320]  I didn't see that. Uh, I think there was a new build last week. I don't know. I haven't,
[52:56.320 --> 53:01.120]  I haven't, I don't touch the betas for that kind of stuff, so I'm not sure.
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.280]  All right. But I just wonder though, that if Apple was going to commit to making a beats
[53:05.280 --> 53:10.080]  app for Apple TV, whether they would do it for the current Apple TV generation or
[53:10.880 --> 53:15.680]  put that in the third major version of the iOS Apple TV.
[53:17.120 --> 53:22.800]  Yeah. They've been adding a bunch of stuff. A lot of it is, you know, not very useful, but
[53:22.800 --> 53:26.640]  although I think there's a new NFL app coming or something like that.
[53:27.200 --> 53:35.520]  Yeah. Well, or isn't it going to have, um, um, possible to do the Sunday ticket?
[53:36.720 --> 53:40.640]  I don't know if they announced that. I think, cause I think direct TV still controls that,
[53:40.640 --> 53:47.040]  but I think there's an NFL app that does other stuff, but I don't, I haven't been
[53:47.040 --> 53:52.240]  paying that close of attention. No, here it is. Apple TV, NFL Sunday ticket coming to iOS.
[53:52.240 --> 53:59.040]  Oh, not, not Apple TV, iOS and Mac for 2014. No, it's, it is decoupled from a direct TV. Now
[53:59.040 --> 54:02.080]  it's no longer exclusive to direct TV, which I think is going to be huge.
[54:02.080 --> 54:09.840]  Well, no, that's not actually true. No, no. Uh, people got really excited because there
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.240]  was some news release about that. But if you, if you read the fine print, you have to punch
[54:14.240 --> 54:22.800]  in your zip code and most of America does not qualify for the streaming direct streaming Sunday
[54:22.800 --> 54:28.720]  ticket. Like my in Chicago, my mom's zip code does not qualify in New York. You can do it,
[54:28.720 --> 54:33.280]  but you've always been able to do in New York because it's almost impossible to get direct TV
[54:33.280 --> 54:40.960]  here. Um, but yeah, that was like blown way out of proportion. That's actually not, not,
[54:40.960 --> 54:47.440]  not happening. Uh, it's like university people who live in dorms can do it. And then also people
[54:47.440 --> 54:53.680]  who live in basically New York city and maybe, I don't know about some other cities where you just
[54:53.680 --> 54:58.240]  can't install a dish or that they assume most people can, cause obviously I guess some people
[54:58.240 --> 55:05.840]  in New York city could, but right. Uh, but most people need like a place to, you know, screw in
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.040]  the satellite dish with a Southern reception and all that kind of stuff. Right. I don't have that.
[55:11.040 --> 55:18.000]  Um, so anyway, yeah, I don't know, but there's like, I think an NFL app coming that, um,
[55:19.360 --> 55:25.440]  that does some other stuff. Yeah. Some NFL app. I don't know. Yeah. Well, most of the other
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.720]  major pro leagues have, have something similar. Yeah. At least in the U S I mean,
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.920]  that's half the reason I have it. Apple TV is the at bat or whatever it's called. Right.
[55:36.640 --> 55:44.240]  Now, no, uh, breaking new ground here, but it, it does though. Every, every time they add an app or
[55:44.240 --> 55:49.360]  whatever you want to call them a channel to the current Apple TV, it's strained the limits of
[55:49.360 --> 55:57.280]  the simple up, down, left, right. Infrared remote more and more. So I'd still think that it's a sign
[55:57.280 --> 56:04.400]  that a new Apple TV is coming with some kind of new UI. Yeah. They, at this point, you know,
[56:04.400 --> 56:07.280]  and you can like kind of hide this, this stuff, I guess, but
[56:10.160 --> 56:16.080]  up, you know, all the things that make the app store so logical and great, like, you know,
[56:16.080 --> 56:20.960]  developers being able to issue updates and all that kind of stuff. That's still very much missing
[56:20.960 --> 56:27.520]  from current. Yeah. And the infrared thing is it just, it's just strained more and more because
[56:27.520 --> 56:34.800]  it's like some coasters in front of my Apple TV and I couldn't use the remote. I had to move them.
[56:34.800 --> 56:40.800]  Right. So they were blocking the line of sight, right? Like we have, uh, the Xbox one now and
[56:41.440 --> 56:47.920]  I don't really use it as a TV, but it's like the main Xbox interface though is, is sort of like
[56:47.920 --> 56:52.080]  windows seven, you know, with tiles and some of the tiles are big and some are small, but you
[56:52.080 --> 56:57.520]  largely navigate it up, down, left, right. Select, but because you have a real controller and it's,
[56:57.520 --> 57:03.280]  you know, got a Bluetooth connection every time you hit up, it goes up every time you hit right,
[57:03.280 --> 57:06.800]  it goes right. And it happens instantly because it's a controller that's built for,
[57:07.680 --> 57:15.680]  you know, video game like, um, uh, timing. And then every time I go back to the Apple TV and
[57:15.680 --> 57:22.880]  it's like up, up, up, up, up, just to go up once and trying to target the little sensor. Exactly.
[57:22.880 --> 57:26.240]  It's like, God, this is maddening. Even just switching the Bluetooth would be a huge upgrade.
[57:26.240 --> 57:30.000]  I think that they'll probably do more, but even if they just came out with an Apple TV that had
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.320]  a Bluetooth remote and stuck to up, down, left, right, select, it would be an upgrade.
[57:35.280 --> 57:39.200]  I think that's probably the kind of thing that's ready to roll. They're just, they're waiting for
[57:39.200 --> 57:43.760]  other stuff, but I wonder too, though, if they have something more in mind for the main interface
[57:43.760 --> 57:50.880]  than just a five by whatever grid of apps, because it's, there's a certain limit to that, you know,
[57:51.840 --> 57:57.760]  to the usefulness of that. Yeah. I, you know, but you also think they may have done that for
[57:57.760 --> 58:01.840]  the phone by now and they haven't done anything like that. So I wonder, and if they do it with
[58:01.840 --> 58:07.600]  the beats app, I wonder it would be an interesting sign of how are they going to treat beats? Like,
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.080]  are they going to treat beats as part of Apple? Cause you know how like there's, you can hold
[58:12.080 --> 58:17.440]  select down on Apple TV, on any of the apps outside the top row and move them around.
[58:17.440 --> 58:21.600]  So like if you use Netflix all the time, you can make sure that it's in the upper left,
[58:22.320 --> 58:27.920]  right below the built in movies app. But the movies, TV shows, music, computers, and settings
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.760]  apps are locked in in the top row. The ones that are tied to Apple stuff like would be beats
[58:33.760 --> 58:40.000]  treated as one of those Apple things that you can't move around or would it be like, uh, more
[58:40.000 --> 58:44.240]  like iTunes trailers, which is an app that you can move all the way to the bottom if you don't use it.
[58:45.280 --> 58:50.960]  Right. Yeah. I mean, my guess is probably more like iTunes trailers, but then they have two
[58:50.960 --> 58:58.640]  different music services. I dunno, it gets weird, but I, where does beats go on in iOS too? Is it
[58:58.640 --> 59:04.720]  become part of the music app or is it always a separate app store app? I think they're going to
[59:04.720 --> 59:09.280]  keep it separate and I think they're going to keep again in the retail stores. I brought this
[59:09.280 --> 59:12.320]  up weeks ago, like when it was first announced, but like, are they going to get rid of the
[59:13.120 --> 59:19.360]  Bose headphones and then, you know, JBL? No, but are they going to give beats special treatment?
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.360]  I mean, I don't think they'll give beats bad treatment and they might give them slightly
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.280]  premium treatment, you know, in terms of, I think they kind of do already. I mean, yeah,
[59:27.280 --> 59:31.600]  it seems like so many of the headphones were beats to begin with. Yeah. I noticed that I
[59:31.600 --> 59:36.240]  wanted, as soon as they announced before they even announced it, when it just was like a reported,
[59:36.240 --> 59:40.480]  Hey, Apple is going to buy them for this much money. And we were all like, wow,
[59:40.480 --> 59:45.440]  I stopped in the Apple store just to look at how much beats stuff they had and where it was. And
[59:45.440 --> 59:50.160]  I guess it, I think it was safe to say that, that it was the most dominant headphone in the Apple
[59:50.160 --> 59:55.920]  store already, but, but still treated like this is, here's a section of the store where we sell
[59:55.920 --> 01:00:01.200]  stuff from other companies. Yeah. All right. Let me take a break and thank our second sponsor,
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.640]  our good friends at Squarespace. You guys know Squarespace. It's the all in one website hosting,

[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.600]  of the clock. Uh, I don't know what more to say about it. The other thing about Squarespace that
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:53.040]  I always repeat is that they also offer amazing built in, uh, commerce capabilities. You can
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:01.760]  build a store in Squarespace that takes credit cards securely, uh, so much easier than anything
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.480]  else I've ever seen with customization of how you present the items in your, in your store,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:13.280]  what's available. Um, it's just so much easier than anything else I've ever seen to do online
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.360]  commerce. It's ridiculous. So if that's part of what you're planning to do and you don't check

[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.240]  about Squarespace before, but maybe you didn't have a website to build before, but now you have
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.320]  something on your plate. You need to build a website for, go check them out. squarespace.com
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:09.760]  slash Gruber. My thanks to Squarespace long time supporter of this show. So what else were we
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.120]  talking about? We're talking about, I guess the events next week, next month, whatever.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.160]  Yeah. Well, um, do you want to talk about the, uh, international,
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.960]  like the Samsung's troubles in, uh, yeah. Cause you wrote about that. That was actually,
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:30.240]  I wrote a little about it and I mean, I've been reading a lot about it and obviously I don't, uh,
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:37.520]  have the encyclopedic knowledge that say Benedict Evans or, or Ben Thompson have about,
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.840]  you know, the Asian markets, uh, for mobile devices, but it's really interesting what's
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.000]  happening right now because, uh, and this was, I don't know if I should, I don't know if I was
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.120]  going to write this post or not, but remember that slide from, uh, the original iPhone announcement
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:01.200]  where Steve jobs had all the old. Smartphones up. Yeah. It seems like all of those companies
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:08.800]  are gone basically. Uh, yeah, it was like Palm, Palm, Nokia and, uh, Blackberry. Right. Something
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.560]  like that. Yeah. And did he have a Samsung up? If he did, it was the Samsung black Jack,
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:22.560]  which was their hilariously copy of the, of the Blackberry. Right. Uh, I know he referenced the
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:29.600]  black Jack here. It's the, uh, the Motorola Q, the Blackberry, the Palm trio and the Nokia
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:38.560]  E 62. Yeah. So Motorola, Nokia Palm, Blackberry. Yeah. Basically all toast. So it's interesting
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.880]  because it, you know, and that, that happened over the course of several years. And of course,
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:51.280]  Motorola is still technically, I think now part of, uh, it's going to be part of Lenovo. That's
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.440]  what I don't know if that's actually finalized yet though. I don't know that it has. I think so. I
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.600]  don't know. But, and then, you know, Nokia is part of Microsoft and HP price still owns the
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.080]  rights to someday relaunch Palm or something like that. Yeah. Uh, and Blackberry is still
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:13.600]  technically in business too, but you know, you, you see Samsung flying high and, you know, besides
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:18.640]  Apple, the only truly profitable company and mobile, and then all of a sudden things are
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.120]  looking so great. Um, you know, in the story that they're getting kind of their butts kicked in,
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.440]  in China and things aren't so great in India either, where they supposedly, you know,
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.440]  had built such a great distribution system and that kind of stuff. And it's, it's fascinating.
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:39.280]  And, and China, they've been passed, they've lost the number one spot for smartphones to
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.560]  Xiaomi, right? I guess. And, you know, and of course that's the kind of thing that,
[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.880]  that it's probably close and it could probably change back and, and it's still, yeah. And it's,
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:58.720]  to be fair, it's based on largely on third party market share summaries from companies like IDC,
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.400]  which I just linked to a few weeks ago about how, yeah, how made up some of their PC market share
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.440]  numbers have been over the years, you know, but it's the best that we can go by, but at the very
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:14.320]  least, you know, I'm sure they're in the ballpark, right. But sticking to facts, we do know that
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.800]  financially Samsung has reported a bad, a bump quarter. Yeah. And that's a fact. So it's not out
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:27.120]  of the question that, you know, it seems like it, it matches with that, that they've lost momentum
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.840]  in China and then they've lost momentum in India, which is very different. And we, and I linked to
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.240]  Ben Thompson piece and a news report, you know, but about how different India is from China,
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:43.520]  that we, they call it the brick countries. I've said this before, and it's so weird to me,
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.640]  but it's Brazil, Russia, India, and China, but really all that those that they're, you know,
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.320]  that there's different economics from like Western Europe and the U S but the thing that the only
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.680]  thing that those countries really have in common is that they're huge. And then there's a lot of
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.640]  people in all of them, but like India and China really can't be lumped together as one thing
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.120]  because economically, they're so very different. Like there may be, you know, a billion poor
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:17.120]  people and, you know, so many electronics are made in China that that was natural for,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:22.080]  for local Chinese companies to all of a sudden, but the biggest difference. And Ben Thompson
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:29.680]  wrote about this was, is that in China has incredible economic, um, what's it called
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.840]  inequality where yes, there are the poor people in China are very, very poor by our standard,
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.480]  but there's an awful lot of people who are some number of people in China who make, you know,
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.520]  have a very high income. It's spread tremendously. And even if it's only a few percent, a few percent
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.560]  of, you know, 2 billion people in China is, is tens, if not hundreds of millions of people.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:07:00.720]  And in India, the poor are even poorer, and there's not as much income inequality where the
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.200]  people at the top aren't making as much as the people in China. And so it's a very different
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.480]  economic situation. I think the problem Samsung, or the other thing that Samsung is what I wanted
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.120]  to mention, and I think I'd like to hear your thoughts on it is, to me, it ties in with the
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.840]  trend that I've noticed recently is that people have sort of shut up about Apple needs to make
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:25.120]  a cheap iPhone, which I think was part of a narrative that started about two, two to three
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:32.400]  years ago, which was, hey, Samsung is gaining market share, whether it was in the US or worldwide
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:39.520]  in smartphones, and Android is, you know, gaining even faster, but Samsung's gobbling up a huge part
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:46.640]  of it. And that that there go, Apple's in trouble. And to the only way they can win back market
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:53.760]  shares with a cheap, cheap iPhone, which is very different thing than a lower priced iPhone,
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.640]  like just gently edging lower and lower into lower price points year over year, that Apple needs to
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.240]  jump in headfirst with a cheap iPhone to stave this off. And because look, Samsung's killing
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.200]  them. Samsung is just or is growing too fast. And now that Samsung's cooled off, I think it
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:18.400]  coincides with people. What was J arrow had a post on Business Insider, maybe Apple knows what it's
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:24.080]  doing with its iPhone strategy after all something to that. Yeah, totally. But it was funny. It's a
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:28.320]  funny headline. And I know that the macalope made fun of it. But it's in some ways, it's actually
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:34.880]  a great head headline, because it actually, to me, encapsulates what I think a lot of analysts,
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.800]  pundits and investors have actually are actually thinking. I think it's a little more nuanced than
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:49.040]  that, though, because it's not just that Samsung, the phone maker was cleaning Apple's clock,
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:56.640]  it's that Android, the platform was, you know, if market shares what you're going by,
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.480]  Android has destroyed Apple, right? Period. Like, it's, you know, it's not even close. It's not
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:10.080]  Windows Mac level, but it's like, whatever 7030 or something like that, worldwide 8020 I don't know.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.640]  And the thinking was that, you know, if this is the new, if this is the new OS platform war,
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:25.920]  and, you know, for the for the next 20 years or something like that, then Apple can't afford to
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.880]  not be the dominant player there. Because this isn't just about phones, this is about tablets
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.640]  and, and, you know, all kinds of future devices, and now extending to televisions, and probably
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.360]  now wearables and all that kind of stuff. So if Apple loses people's phones, they've lost that
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.800]  that person's whole life. And if, you know, this is the new software platform for the next couple
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:56.560]  of decades, then that's, that's potentially troublesome. But I think we've seen that maybe,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.800]  you know, that the market share advantage that Android has, is a lot more splintered than the
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:11.040]  western dominated Windows Mac war, you know, like, what's going on with Android in China is probably
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.080]  pretty different than what's going on with Android in in western markets, you know, hardware and
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:24.720]  software wise, and you have these, these messaging companies that that catch on in different markets
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.680]  and become really huge and popular and that kind of stuff. And I don't know, so maybe it's a
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:35.120]  dawning realization on more people that market share isn't everything, that it's not it doesn't
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.560]  trump every mobile is different, and that market share and mobile is different than it meant in
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:47.360]  meant in the PC platform work. And even as I've said before, though, even in PCs, right, the Mac
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.720]  still exists. And by most by most accounts, I've seen in terms of traditional PC, not counting
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:59.120]  tablets, just counting what we always thought of things with Intel CPUs, x86 CPUs, right, laptops,
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:06.320]  desktops running either Windows or Mac, or you know, Linux, that Apple makes about 50% of the
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.560]  profit in the whole PC industry. Yeah, by far and away, number one, in terms of the profit they have
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:21.600]  in the PC industry, in a what everybody would consider a mature market, a settled, mature
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:27.600]  market. And I would say it's also almost never now that you run into the to the real problem,
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.640]  which was that software existed for Windows, but not for Mac, right, you can pretty much get
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.600]  whatever you want for Mac, you know, obviously, there's some stuff that's still games only games
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.440]  is still is still a different situation. Right? Although mobile has kind of, you know, and the
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:49.520]  game consoles have kind of made PCs less important for gaming. Yeah, I don't see people complain. I
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.600]  still think clearly, Windows PCs are, you know, far more, you know, have more new titles, and run
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.840]  things better. Excel is still better for Windows, obviously, but but I don't see people complaining
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.920]  about games on Macs anymore so much, mainly because I think mobile is a bigger deal and
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.320]  consoles are a bigger, you know, bigger deal. Yeah, but this was the big fear that, you know,
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:17.280]  if Android gets this, this huge advantage and market share that all of a sudden, all the best
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:23.280]  apps are going to be either Android first or Android only. And you know, as my reporting,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:30.480]  about a month and a half ago, proved, that's not the case, like, Android, despite its massive
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.320]  market share lead is still either getting developed, you know, at the same time as iOS
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:42.720]  or after. There are very few important apps that are Android first or Android only.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.960]  And, you know, I don't know if that's going to change, it might.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.360]  But it doesn't look like it. It doesn't seem to be happening. No.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.760]  So so that, you know, so that's what that whole market share slash platform war argument was
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.440]  about. And I know, you know, that's what Jay was thinking, because Jay and I were working
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:08.320]  together and we were talking about this stuff. And that's, you know, and Henry, our, you know,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.680]  our boss was the one who was the one writing that the iPhone was dead in the water. Remember that?
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.800]  Right. No, how can you forget?
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:20.800]  It's all based on the argument that, you know, this platform war really, really,
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.760]  really mattered and that market share was key to that. And I think we're learning that mobile's
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.200]  a little different, at least so far. I mean, you know, no one knows what's going to happen
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.560]  in a few years. Well, I think the thing that's different is the post internet world. I think
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:46.320]  that's the thing that really, like a lot of things happened between 95, 1994, 95 and 1998,
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:52.560]  which I think people confused in their head as meaning, hey, when you lose the market share war,
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.560]  you go away, you go bye bye. And that a lot of people summed it up as in the back of their heads,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:05.440]  that Windows 95 came out and was either as good or at least good enough as the Mac.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.240]  And people, you know, Windows 95 came out and people lined up around stores to get it at
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:17.840]  midnight, like they do for Apple products, right? It was that popular, right? I mean, that's,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:24.800]  that's, I mean, just a good basic rule of thumb. If you have normal consumers lining up around the
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.600]  block to get into a store to buy your product, you've got something, right? Apple has that now,
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.920]  Microsoft had it then. And it, you know, it was a problem for Apple. And but a big thing, too,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.160]  was with the big, whether it was 90 to 10 95, five, whatever the percentage split was between
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:48.000]  Windows and Mac PCs, when you had to interchange stuff by floppy disk, and they even even the
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.200]  floppy disks had different formats. And if you put a Mac floppy disk into a, you know, Windows PC,
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.360]  it would say, Do you need to reformat this, and you'd lose everything on it. And Macs eventually
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:02.400]  gained the ability to read DOS formatted disks, but when Microsoft was never going to bother
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.960]  supporting Mac formatted disks, and the file formats weren't the same. And if you had a Word
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.160]  document that was created on PC, and you opened it Microsoft Word on your, on your Mac, and everything
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.560]  reflowed, and then when you send it back to people, it was all screwed up. It was all a problem. And
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.840]  it was all didn't we buy some like $60 app to like, just convert? Yeah, I forget the name of
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.600]  that. It was great. Oh, it worked. It worked a charm. I forget the name of that. I don't know
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.400]  exactly what you're talking about. But all those things. But then the internet happened. And or and
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:35.120]  then Apple got into financial problems and really was on the cusp of bankruptcy, but not really so
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.840]  much just because of market share and problems on the Mac, but just that the company was horribly
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.600]  run, and that they'd had these failed initiatives at the next time is a far more complex story than
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:53.840]  just market share. But the internet really healed over the whole, hey, I'm using platform A, and
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.400]  you're using platform B, and we need to communicate and exchange stuff. Right. And that really helped,
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.120]  I think, not just Apple, but anybody, you know, who wanted to come up with a new platform forever
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.600]  after is that you don't have to worry about me, even just simple networking, just getting
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.040]  a Mac and Windows computer on the same network in the early 90s was like, almost impossible,
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.080]  and especially to have them both be treated as peers. Whereas the internet is this open standard,
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.560]  you know, involves all these open standards for networking. Yeah, and even if you look at the
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:29.120]  native apps that are the most popular on Android and iOS, they're all basically just interface
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:36.480]  code, you know, interacting with an API. So even if, you know, Android gets some sort of,
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.800]  you know, market share advantage, it's not that hard. Like people would build Windows apps,
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.240]  and then not build a Mac app, because it was, you know, a lot of money and time and all this stuff
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.880]  and documents and all that sort of everything you just described. But the difference between
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.280]  building an iOS app and an Android app is mostly just interface code at this point. Right. So
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.560]  in really broad terms, conceptually, the whole computing world is built on the foundation is now
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.840]  the internet. Yeah. And it's, you know, not just the World Wide Web, but TCP, IP in general,
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.280]  and HTTP. It's the internet. And then we all pick devices that run a certain platform
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.800]  and connect to the internet. Whereas pre internet, the foundation of the world was whatever operating
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:24.160]  system your computer was running. And so if you were on a Mac, the Mac OS and the ecosystem of
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:30.560]  Mac apps was the foundation of the computing world. And for PCs, it was Windows and Windows apps.
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:35.120]  And that meant that they were not compatible. So I think in the modern world, it's, it's,
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:43.120]  it's just, it's very possible, not just for two platforms to coexist and thrive, like Android and
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:47.680]  iOS, but you know, it could be could be three, I think it's unlikely that there'd be a slew
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.480]  that there'd be like 10 different, you know, platforms for mobile devices that would thrive.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:59.120]  But yeah, we're seeing like third place now dip to, you know, what, 3% of the market are four.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.240]  So yeah, it looks like a two horse race at this point. But I don't think it's inconceivable,
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.280]  reroll the dice for the last six or seven years of the end, you come up with an alternate universe
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:14.160]  where, you know, maybe if it had come out a little sooner, and it had more corporate support that
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.720]  Palm OS, you know, was still, yeah, you know, six, 7%, like a Mac sized market. And with
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:26.160]  good margins, you know, it's a good business. Yeah. But I think a lot of people looked at
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:32.240]  those, you know, that Apple's near bankruptcy, and, and decided that in a platform battle,
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.880]  if you don't win, you're going to go bankrupt, and don't really think about the fact that Apple came
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.240]  back, and that that was a long time ago. And now that the market has matured, the Mac business has
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:49.200]  been thriving for well over a decade consistently. So by those lines, the company then that maybe
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.880]  in the greatest position of power is not necessarily the company that runs the OS,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:03.440]  but the company that runs those back end services, which increasingly is Google. Yeah. And so,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.880]  but I'm also a little surprised by how committed Google has been to continuing to make stuff
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.560]  for iOS, you know, to the to the point that they would even sponsor your website. Right.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.720]  Your website, right? When, when they could, theoretically, say, Okay, from now on, our best
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:27.360]  stuff is, is Android only? And you know, there's some like Google now, I think is probably going
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.440]  to be a better experience on Android. Because Yeah, well, Google now is a unique example,
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:36.080]  because it's really tied into the right system, you know, the idea that you need to launch an
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.280]  app for it really defeats it, it really wants to be in that, that gifted position that Siri is in.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.440]  Yeah. So if that if that sort of feed stream AI type thing is the future of,
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.920]  you know, mobile computing, then that's the kind of thing where Apple market share could be
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.840]  a problem, right? Like, you know, unless Apple does a better job at that with Siri, although,
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.320]  you know, I think, for example, I think that there were an R third party keyboard apps for iOS now,
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.280]  but they just run as an app. And, you know, show their keyboard, and you do your typing and copy
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.000]  and paste it and go back to another app and paste it into the app, which nobody's going to do. Like
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.440]  the only way you could really have a thriving market of third party keyboards for your OS is
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.000]  if you really support them at the system level, like Apple's doing an iOS eight, I think that
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.760]  that's probably going to prove popular. Whereas something like Google now isn't really going to
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.200]  have a chance to thrive unless Apple somehow made Siri, that sort of thing where you could replace
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:45.920]  Siri with Google now or with katana. Yeah, I don't know if they would ever do that. Just me talking
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:54.080]  made the iOS eight. Hey, Siri thing. I was wondering what that was. That's funny. Seems
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:21:00.080]  like I cut you off. Can you please repeat that? Yeah, it said. It heard me say replace Siri with
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.240]  Siri. And she got upset. Nice. Yeah. So I wonder if there's a point at which Google,
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:12.400]  you know, sees the market share in their advantage says, All right, well, we're done doing Google
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.680]  Maps for iOS now or something like that. But it doesn't seem to be the direction they're going in.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.480]  Yeah. And as Microsoft in his Google, sometimes old Microsoft in his Google sometimes is that
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.920]  doesn't seem to be the way they think. That would be out. I think there might be some people within
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.040]  Google who think that but I think that certainly the people making the iOS apps aren't would be
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:41.760]  and I and I think they're so scared of antitrust stuff that they won't because that could really
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:51.280]  screw them up. They have to chop themselves up. So you know, a public seeming support for iOS
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:56.000]  probably makes them look really good. Yeah, in the same way that it did for Microsoft in 1997,
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.600]  when they cut the deal with Apple and to five years of, you know, office support and stuff
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.800]  like that. Even more so because at Microsoft was already in anti big antitrust trouble at the time.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.480]  Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that's something that Google has to worry about that Apple
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:15.680]  doesn't because Google has at least one monopoly, which is on web search.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.440]  Yeah, and Chrome is starting to move in that direction too. And
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.040]  well, I don't think it's a question. I don't think Chrome is ever going to get to monopoly size.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:33.680]  No, probably not. But the other thing they're doing now and I actually learned a lot about
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:40.560]  this on Friday is that the EU is like really looking into the way they're using Google Plus
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.360]  as part of search results. And I don't, you know, they may just get a slap on the wrist,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.600]  but some other stuff might happen that that makes it really bad for them. So I don't know.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.920]  But so we'll see about that. But yeah, Google searches, obviously, they're biggest.
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:04.240]  Well, the EU I know the EU is largely skeptical. I do. I had, you know, wouldn't be surprised at
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.560]  all. And maybe I'd be more surprised if something big doesn't come of it. But just the general way
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:14.320]  that Google favors its own products and search results. Yeah, that like, yeah, just getting worse.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.960]  And if you just type in, I'm guessing, I don't know, I'm gonna go to Google and just type if
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:24.720]  you type calendar software, does it show, you know, suggest Google Calendar. And I know that
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:29.920]  like, when you search for businesses, they show Google Plus results for that business. And it's
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:36.800]  not part of doesn't show Google Calendar as a first result. But you know, I don't know. But I
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.360]  know for you to type like a restaurant name, it favors the Google Plus page for that. Oh,
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.400]  you know what, if you just type calendar, all right, if you just type the word calendar into
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:50.000]  Google, the first result is Google Calendar. Oh, nice. Well, I don't know. Is that nice? Oh,
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.920]  I don't know. But I know that the use of your Google. Yeah. So looks very askance at that,
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.600]  because that's what they would call. Is it bundling? I don't know what the antitrust term
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.520]  for it is. But it's using, it's exactly what Microsoft got in trouble with, with Windows,
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.880]  it's using, you know, that having a monopoly is not necessarily illegal, and often isn't illegal
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:17.040]  at all. But using that monopoly to gain an advantage in a different market is right. And
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:24.720]  if they're using the Google search monopoly to promote Google Plus, unreasonably against,
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:31.120]  you know, natural competitors, then that could be problematic. So and not having a monopoly gives
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.440]  Apple way more freedom than they would otherwise, like there's probably an arm's length list of
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:45.600]  things that Apple is doing that if if iOS had 90% smartphone market share would certainly Oh, yeah,
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.800]  certainly have the EU taking them to court and might even have the US Department of Justice,
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.520]  which is even with, you know, Obama in the seventh year of his administration is far more
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:05.440]  business friendly than the EU. Yeah, the App Store itself. Yeah, I think yeah, that's probably the
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.680]  prime example that the way that they run the App Store and that there's no sideloading of apps,
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.360]  that would probably be the central, that would probably be the big one, that would probably be
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.600]  like the centerpiece of a legal fight. And I don't think they'd be able to win it.
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:25.440]  Yeah, which things have, I mean, I remember when the App Store first launched, that was kind of a
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.840]  lot of a lot of controversy, but people seem to have gotten used to it. And, you know, with
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:37.760]  test flight, who knows, you know, in a couple years, there could be side, you know, more
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.520]  widespread sideloading of apps, but no, but that would definitely be the thing. And I've even seen
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.360]  people make the stupid argument, which is that Apple does have a monopoly. They have a monopoly
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:54.720]  on the OS for iPhones. But that's Yeah, it's not a monopoly. Yeah. Is anyone is anyone running
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.960]  Android? Can you crack an iPhone and run Android on there? I don't think so. I've seen people try
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.520]  and maybe there was like once or twice a long time ago where somebody got something vaguely working,
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:14.000]  but it's not a thing. You cannot. So back to Samsung, I think that the other thing that we're
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.920]  really seeing is that Samsung has, they've done a great job. And they've obviously had a good,
[01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:25.040]  good couple of years. But that they're, it's increasingly becoming obvious that they're
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:31.120]  getting pinched on both sides, that Apple still dominates, or maybe not dominates, but certainly
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.640]  has a long term is sustained advantage at the high end of the smartphone market, like the
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:43.280]  multi 100 priced handsets that Apple still sells a majority of those, which is historically where
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:48.640]  the profits are, yeah, where the profits are. And at the low end, at the lower priced and where
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:56.000]  Apple doesn't compete at all, they're increasingly losing to companies like Xiaomi, and, you know,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.440]  other ones that a lot of us even here in the US haven't even heard of, or don't even have
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.760]  access to. But certainly, that's, that's been a problem for them in China. And that is, you know,
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:11.040]  that's where their market share is eroding. Right now, and those get, you know, people to
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.600]  look at Samsung stuff, and then maybe even buy a higher end thing or something like that,
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.960]  right, and you lose the advantage to maybe, maybe it's not high margin, but, you know,
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:26.880]  low margin times a big number still equals a lot of money. Yeah. And, you know, you lose that
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.800]  advantage. And then all the scale advantages that come with all that. And, you know, I,
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.760]  you know, the post I published that you linked to, obviously, was a little tongue in cheek.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:45.200]  You know, here's Samsung's future stock chart. And it was the Nokia chart from the day the iPhone
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:52.720]  launched to the day that Microsoft bought Nokia. So which looks like a ski downhill ski slope.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.440]  I don't think that's the future for Samsung. I mean, it's a huge conglomerate, and they do
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:08.000]  so much more stuff than, than I think Nokia did, you know, ranging from TVs to the chips that go
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.920]  into other phones and that kind of stuff. So, and they've proven I don't see them collapsing, but
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:20.640]  it's doesn't look great either. All right, they've proven to be more nimble than Nokia. But I don't
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:25.920]  know if they're nimble enough. And it's, it's that right. They don't really have good footing
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:33.600]  in this market, you know, where I think Apple does, and I think company like Xiaomi does,
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:42.880]  and maybe even I know Ben Thompson is, is a big is bullish on Lenovo. Once they, you know,
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.200]  finish the Motorola app acquisition, and Lenovo might do real really well in China.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.800]  And other places just, you know, nipping, you know, 5% here, 6% there, 7% to another company,
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.160]  and all of a sudden, the low end is is bifurcated, and maybe is a lot more like the PC market.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:06.480]  Yeah, now all of a sudden, Apple has a, you know, five inch iPhone, and maybe you don't need to buy
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.760]  that Galaxy Note. So right, the last few years, you know, to compare the smartphone market and
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:19.600]  the PC market, the last few years have been sort of like, you know, if one PC maker just had
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  enormous market share of Windows, you know, 60-70% of Windows sales, like raw Dells,
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.240]  that would be really good for Dell, but that's not how the PC market is the PC market, you know,
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:36.000]  I think the number one spot has moved around a lot, but it's never been more than like 20%
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:43.760]  for HP or Dell or any of any one company. And it's, you know, you quickly get into that long
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.240]  tail where there's all sorts of, you know, no name companies making really cheap machines.
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:53.680]  And it's all split up. And it's, as we can see, there's no, you know, there's, there's no money
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:58.960]  to be made in a market like that. Like nobody else other than Apple is making big money in PCs.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.840]  And it might soon be that no, no other company than Apple is making big money in in mobile handsets.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:10.800]  Right. And there's nothing locking Samsung customers into Samsung the way that there
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.800]  would be. And they've tried to, you know, try to make their own music. And I think
[01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.960]  I think, I don't know if they ever did their own app store, but they, you know,
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:26.160]  yeah, music, they do have that kind of stuff. And none of that really caught on,
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:33.360]  I think, in large part because they're not very good at software. Yeah. And also Google has
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:40.480]  pressured all the Android companies to, you know, kind of promote Google Play and not, you know,
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:47.360]  at risk of losing all the Google, Google support. So, right. I think Google has made it such that
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.960]  Samsung really doesn't have that much to lock people into. Right. I think then I think they're
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.160]  obviously aware of it, because there's no other reason that Tizen, their own software platform,
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.560]  even exists. But I like you said, they're just not good at it. And if they're not even good at
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.120]  making apps for Android, I mean, how good are they going to be at making an entire platform?
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.920]  And it's such an uphill battle. I mean, you look, I mean, Microsoft, who we know is good at making
[01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:19.840]  platforms and good at making developer tools and creating developer APIs, can't get much traction
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:26.400]  in the market and can't get first class support from third party developers the way that Android
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.480]  and iOS have. Well, then how is Samsung going to do it with an all new platform? Right? Because
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:36.640]  it's not just good enough, even if they made a version of Tizen that was objectively so good,
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:43.200]  objectively speaking good enough, you know, like as good as Android. It's that alone doesn't mean
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:49.520]  that they would get an app store full of third party apps. Right? It's totally Yeah. And then
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:53.520]  even if and if they don't, then it's dead in the water, you know, to borrow the Henry's phrase,
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:58.640]  it really would be Yeah, I mean, because look at Microsoft has been trying to even pay companies
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:05.280]  to make Windows phone apps. And that's been such an uphill battle. Right? As it is, I think, you
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:12.800]  know, to close the loop on this, it, it really makes it just seem even how much more impressive
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:20.480]  and unlikely it was for Apple to succeed so strongly, because they weren't making mobile
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:27.040]  phones before and they weren't making touch based operating systems and app stores and all that kind
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:32.560]  of stuff. It was kind of nuts how well they've done. Yeah. And and the you know, the profit
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.560]  margins and all that sort of stuff. And not just pieces of it, but all of it. Like it's,
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.320]  the iPhone really is a lot more, you know, for all the praise that's gotten, it really is more
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:48.080]  even more impressive than it seems. Yeah, I totally agree. And I think that it's it the way
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:54.000]  that they made it look easy. Keep makes it easy to overlook that. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just looking here.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:59.360]  So Instagram, this is one example. But Instagram for Windows Phone debuted eight months ago. So
[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:06.720]  early 2014. But Instagram for Android came in March 2012. So two years after Android,
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.920]  they came out with a Windows Phone version. And Instagram was rather famous for being iOS only for
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:16.160]  what seemed like a long time seemed like the Android version took, you know,
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:22.000]  took them a long time to get to. Right. And I remember reading that it was Nokia that actually
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.400]  got them to, to do a Windows version, not even Microsoft. It was that they were impressed by
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:34.640]  the cameras on Nokia hardware. So they went went and build a Windows Phone. Right. So just repeat
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.880]  that over and over again with everybody. And then, you know, filter that down to the smaller
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.160]  developers, you know, the true indie shops, where it's just a handful of developers and designers.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:48.240]  And you're just not going to get it just they're just you're not going to get the support because
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:55.520]  they're all writing iOS and, and Android apps now. Yeah, I should look at the Blackberry App Store
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.920]  and see what's going on there right now. I bet a lot of people have abandoned, you know, the
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:06.000]  companies that had made apps, even at the beginning of it might not be doing that anymore. Like,
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.360]  I wonder if there's an updated. Yeah, MLB app this year. I don't even know.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:15.120]  Yeah, maybe but I wonder. Yeah, I don't even know about that.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.320]  There used to be. I have a bit of FU. I know it's most podcasts do the FU at the beginning
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.880]  follow up. I should mention this. Actually, I guess we should. Oh, there's still at bat
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:33.120]  for Blackberry. Look at that. Look at that at bat 2014. Yep. Yeah. I bet there's some good stories
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.680]  behind that. I wonder if it runs on. Does it run on both platforms though? Is it just for the old
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.560]  Blackberry or does it run on the Blackberry 10? Because it's two different platforms,
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:49.520]  Blackberry 10. Huh? So there you go. But you must purchase a device specific version of at bat 14
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.440]  from the Blackberry world to access it on Blackberry 10. I don't know what that means.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.600]  But I think cool. I think you have to tell them exactly which Blackberry model you have because
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:06.960]  there's two entirely different platforms. Anyway, my FU is when I had molts on the show last episode.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.200]  I was saying how I can't believe people in today's world would buy polarized sunglasses
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:19.920]  because it makes your iPhone look crazy. And, you know, have you ever seen that? You have
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.000]  polarized sunglasses? Yeah, I have to take them off. Yeah, the screens look crazy. Every screen
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  looks different too. Like the iPad and the iPhone have different effects. Well, I heard I got an
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.480]  earful from the fans of polarized sunglasses. And to summarize it, I don't want to stay out,
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:42.800]  but apparently if you buy, quote, goods polarized sunglasses, it shouldn't be a problem. That's
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.520]  only a function of bad polarized sunglasses. If you get expensive ones that are good,
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:55.600]  your iPhone will look good only when you hold the iPhone in its natural portrait orientation. When
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.880]  you hold it sideways, then you get the problem. But so apparently it is possible to use an iPhone
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:08.400]  with polarized sunglasses. So my apologies to fans of polarized sunglasses in the polarized
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:13.360]  sunglasses industry. I don't know where mine are. Actually, do you remember that was the first time
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.720]  we met? You put my sunglasses on and you were shocked at how dirty they were.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.720]  Why did I put your sunglasses on? Oh, I know why. Because I was thinking about,
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.520]  I was thinking about, there were Ray-Bans and I was thinking about getting a pair.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:33.280]  And I asked you if it was on the roof deck at the Macworld. No, no, the deck.
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:38.720]  Yeah, the Macworld deck. No, it was in New York. No, no, no. It was in SF.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.360]  Oh, it was a Macworld party? Snell's party.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:47.200]  Oh, I thought it was the deck book reading. No, I didn't get to go to that.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.560]  You didn't go to that? Oh, that was a different time.
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.160]  I know what you're talking about. You're talking about Kudol's baseball book.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:57.840]  Yeah, I say the deck, but no, not the baseball book. It was the...
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.400]  Oh, the field tested books. Yeah, field tested books where people have written...
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.080]  That is the first time I met you. That's not, I didn't have those sunglasses back then.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.440]  All right. Anyway...
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.040]  That is the first time we met though. Yeah, you're right.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.280]  Field tested books was a thing that Kudol used to run where he'd ask people to write,
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:17.840]  you'd write a review of a book where you read it. And so...
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:20.240]  Which is a brilliant idea.
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.040]  Right. And so you...
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.240]  Because it really makes a difference.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.480]  Right. Like if you remember that I read this one book when I was at this one place,
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:31.840]  then that was field tested books. And it was fascinating, I thought. And I had written one
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.640]  and they held a book, they held a reading in New York and you were there. It was a lovely event.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.200]  It was terrific.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.560]  Yeah, it was great. I still have that book somewhere. I wonder where.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.040]  Yeah, yeah. And they had collected them into a book.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.200]  Anyway, I don't know where my sunglasses are. They're over on the somewhere else.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.040]  Were they polarized? I remember them being very dirty.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.520]  Yeah, they are polarized. So I actually want... And they're clean too. Hold on,
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.880]  give me two seconds. I'm gonna find them. They're right next to me.
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:02.000]  All right. Go look for them. And I'm gonna read the... I'm gonna do a third sponsor.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.520]  Play background music.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:10.400]  No, I'm gonna take this opportunity while Dan is hunting down his polarized sunglasses to tell you...
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:10.960]  I'm back.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.240]  All right. Well, I'm taking this opportunity to tell people about Transporter, FileTransporter.
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.840]  Oh, please do. Great.
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:20.560]  Another repeat sponsor. You've probably heard me talk about them before if you're a regular
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.000]  listener. But if you are or if you haven't, short version, think about it as your own personal
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.200]  Dropbox. What you do is you buy devices. You buy your own device from FileTransporter. It's a thing.
[01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:36.320]  You buy it. It's a gadget. You plug it in. You connect it to your home network.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.400]  And you install some software on your Mac. And all of a sudden, you've got
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.760]  a folder in your home folder that syncs to the device. And then any other device in your house,
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.040]  any other Mac in the house, you can get a folder and it'll do that too.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:57.520]  So it's just like Dropbox. You have a folder. You put files. They sync to the device. You can
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:06.080]  access them from anywhere. The difference is it's your stuff. Your data is actually stored only on
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:10.800]  your FileTransporter device and the drives you connect to it. So they're right there in your
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.120]  house or in your office. You can buy more than one. You can keep one at your house, one at your
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:21.200]  office, put one in your parents' house, put one in your house. And if you sign them into the same
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:27.600]  account, they sync the same data between them. But at no point does your data go to a server
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:37.360]  on the cloud. Interesting for privacy reasons, especially given the allegations that have come
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:41.760]  out over the last two years about what government agencies around the world have been doing to big
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:48.160]  cloud providers. Also interesting from a legal perspective for certain people in certain
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:54.000]  industries where you legally are obligated not to put devices or data onto devices that you don't
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:01.760]  actually have physical control over. Really interesting and I think really appealing to
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.560]  a lot of people, whether it's for legal reasons or just privacy reasons or just the desire to
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:15.920]  have control over your own stuff. They have two types of devices. They have the regular
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.760]  transporter. This comes in 500 gigabyte, one terabyte and two terabyte capacities. That's
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:28.080]  a thing you buy already has a hard drive in it. You just buy it, plug it in. And there's also
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.800]  the transporter sync. That's I call it the puck model. It's just like a little Apple TV puck,
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:37.040]  maybe even smaller, provides the exact same functionality. But instead of coming with a
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:45.200]  hard drive, you just you just plug in your own USB drive, anything with the USB port,
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.080]  any kind of third party hard drive with a USB port, you plug that in on your own. So if you
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.080]  have a bunch of hard drives sitting around or you're already you know, have a big one that you
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.480]  want to use, you can just buy the transporter sync, save some dough and just plug in your own
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:08.880]  hard drive. Here's the URL go to file transporter store.com file www dot file transporter store.com.
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:14.080]  Now if you want to buy the transporter, you can use this code TTS 10. That's the one that comes
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:20.320]  with the built in hard drive, you'll save 10% off your purchase, that's up to 35 bucks for the two
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:27.440]  terabyte version, which costs 350. So you'll save 35 bucks just by using that code TTS 10,
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:35.680]  the talk show 10 TSTN TTS 10. If you buy the sink, the little puck model use this code,
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:42.880]  TTS 20 TTS 20. That doesn't save you a percentage just saves you 20 bucks, just 20 bucks right off
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:53.680]  the top of the sink model. TTS 10 for that one TTS 20 TTS 10 for the transporter TTS 20. For sync
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:00.240]  would have been easier if they just use one code. Make it work for both but don't worry about it,
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.520]  you'll figure it out you're smart enough to buy a transporter you're smart enough to use the right
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.280]  code. Everybody who uses either one of those codes gets free shipping. So if you're wondering
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:16.320]  if transport is right for you, go check it out. See for yourself. And you can buy one and start
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.280]  using it and you have a 30 day risk free satisfaction guarantee. You don't like it,
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:25.600]  use it for a couple of weeks. Box it back up, send it back to them and get all your money back.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.920]  So there you go. Make sure you enter the code just before the final checkout. And check them out at
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.080]  www file transporter store.com. My thanks to them. All right, you guys shades on?
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:43.520]  I do. And so I have four screens in front of me. I have a MacBook Air, I have an iPhone five,
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:48.720]  I have an iPad mini, and I have this Nexus seven. And they all behave differently with
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:55.200]  these sunglasses. Some of them work portrait but not landscape. Some of them work landscape
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:02.640]  but not portrait. Some work both and some work diagonal, everything but diagonal. So who knows?
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:08.080]  Well, I do think it's interesting that the iPad mini and the iPhone five have different screens.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:13.360]  Well, meaning what when you look at your iPhone five, what do you see? Well, I see a green
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:20.080]  as if you had put a green gel over my glasses. So it's terrible. Right. And it doesn't matter
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.160]  whether you hold it sideways or not. No, if you turn it sideways, it works fine. But that's
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:32.000]  landscape. Well, it's almost like two thirds, two thirds diagonal where the colors are better. Well,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.240]  that's no good, though. Nobody uses their phone at two thirds diagonal. No, right. So it's,
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:43.440]  it's not great. But the iPad mini literally looks looks totally normal with my sunglasses on. So
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:50.720]  there's in both orientations. Well, mostly portrait, but not landscape landscape. It's
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:57.440]  a little darker. Right. But either way, there's so all that mythology about how they just cut
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:02.880]  the same screen out of the Yeah, no, I think we've gotten away from that. I think that's
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:08.240]  I don't think that's right. I yeah, because they also laminate the screen to the glass differently.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:15.280]  Like they still have another, you know, whatever 16th of an inch, they can make this iPad skinnier
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:20.960]  if they that way it was rid of some of that space. It was most obvious I thought and I realized that
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:26.800]  that's that I propagated that and it's because they've stuck to it was a simplistic thinking
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.320]  that because they've stuck to these same pixel resolutions, you know, in the pre retina world,
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:37.360]  there were only two two pixel resolutions, you know, pixels prints the iPhone one, which was
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:45.280]  like 162 or 163. And the iPad one, which was 133. And they all their iOS devices were one of those
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:49.040]  two pixel resolutions. And then in the retina world, it's double that it was like, you know,
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:57.200]  it's 320 something 323 and 267 pixels per inch. And every device has one of those pixels prints
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:02.480]  thing. But it's, it's, that's, and there might be some economies of scale to sticking with that.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.160]  But obviously, certain devices have different ones, I thought the most obvious was when they
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:14.800]  came out with the, the iPhone five, coming up on two years ago, and the still today current because
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.960]  they didn't update it last year, the iPod touch that had the 16 to nine aspect ratio. And it's,
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.360]  you know, really lightweight and thin device, you know, the one the metal, the current iPod touch,
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:31.600]  the one that has the camera strap thing and everything. Because the same new screen size,
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:39.200]  same pixel prints resolution. But the saturation and colors on the iPod touch is just nowhere near
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:46.480]  the quality of the iPhone five. And similarly, with the iPad Air and the iPad Mini, the iPad Air
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:53.440]  has such noticeably more vivid color than the mini. Yeah, I think so too. I noticed as a mini
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:58.400]  owner, I never noticed but then when I had them side by side, it was pretty shocking. Yeah,
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:03.200]  I don't I think the mini might have better quality than the iPod touch. But it's definitely not up to
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:09.520]  the iPod. iPad. iPad Air is like, it's crazy. Yeah. I don't I guess because there's a bigger
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:14.240]  battery or something. Yeah. But anyway, the polarized sunglasses. I don't mean to make
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:21.120]  terrible pun, but apparently, it's a very polarizing topic. Yeah, it's a shady.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:28.080]  I think the moral of the story is if you're if you're going sunglass shopping, bring your phone.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.160]  Yeah. And see what works. Yeah. And take a look at your phone. And when you're buying,
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:40.160]  when you buy the sunglasses, right? Yeah. There's Amazon hash it. Is it hash it hash a
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:47.760]  I think it's Hachette Hachette. Yeah, where Amazon and Hachette, the one of the five major book
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:55.840]  publishers are in a continuing spat that they're taking public and and there's been a authors
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.200]  united movement between with, you know, again, it's not unanimous, certainly not that all
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:07.680]  authors or even all successful authors are on Hachette side. Definitely not the case,
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:13.200]  but there's a lot of authors who are see it on the publisher side. And then Amazon launched
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:20.240]  a sort of hamfisted readers united site, which really wasn't united by readers, it was entirely
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.760]  by and written by Amazon. But more or less by they're making the case that it's in readers
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:32.640]  interests for Amazon to come out on top of this because books will be ebooks will be cheaper.
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:40.240]  But it's boy it's an ugly fight. It is and I well, I think it's ugliest to those of us who are
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:46.880]  somewhat exposed to it. I don't know if most people are even know it's happening. Well,
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:50.880]  I don't know that I think people are noticing more and more though, because of things like
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:57.280]  Hachette books not coming out on Amazon, or at least not being available pre order on Amazon,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:04.160]  which true, you know, and for I don't know what 14 or 17 years, I don't know, however long Amazon's
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:09.280]  been selling books. There's an awful lot of us who just, you know, if you hear about a new book,
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.280]  or it's coming out, you just go to Amazon to start typing the book title, and you can
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.120]  either buy it if it's shipping or say, send me this when it comes out. And
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.920]  I think the biggest problem is that no one knows which label their book is going to be on. Right.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:30.480]  It's just confusing. I think it's like when a certain movie studio gets pulled from iTunes
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:36.480]  or something or Netflix or whatever. You don't know that it's missing for that reason. Yeah.
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.600]  Or even when it's one that you kind of know, like I probably a lot of people would know that Star
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:47.040]  Wars is 20th Century Fox because everybody remembers that the 20th Century Fox fanfare
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.800]  before the Star Wars song. Right. Or like everyone knows Pixar is Pixar or something like that.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:56.800]  Yeah. And that they're owned by Disney now. Yeah, certainly. I think that's pretty that's another
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:02.160]  good common one. But nobody really thinks of that in time in terms of am I going to be able to watch
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.800]  this? Like you never had to like in the old days when we'd go to Blockbuster to rent a movie.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:12.560]  You never thought, Well, shit, I want to watch The Unforgiven. But that's, that's Warner Brothers
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:18.800]  and what, you know, and then Blockbuster doesn't have Warner Brothers movies. So I guess I have to
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.800]  go to that other Hollywood video. Yeah, where the Warner Brothers are, you know? Yeah.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.200]  So yeah, that part of it is, is, and I would say with books, it's even less so because it's those
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:34.640]  fanfares that make that stick in my mind. I mean, that's, I'm pretty sure The Unforgiven is, is
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:41.200]  Warner Brothers. But I certainly remember, you know, there's a lot of movies where I remember
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:46.160]  the fanfare I saw before it. Whereas the little tiny publisher stamp on books, boy, I don't,
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.080]  I don't know many books that I know which, which of the big five publishers published it.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:58.240]  No, definitely not. So I don't know it. I have trouble taking sides here, even as a, you know,
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:04.640]  potential someday book author, like, I don't, I don't, I don't think I know enough about what's
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.160]  going on. And that's the thing is, I don't think anyone has actually said what they're
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:14.400]  specifically disagreeing about. Like it's vaguely has to do with pricing for ebooks or something
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.480]  like that. Well, yeah, it's who gets to pick the price of ebooks? Yeah, really? Is it the,
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.280]  but like the details matter? And I don't think anyone's actually revealed what the details are
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:29.040]  that I've seen. I don't know. Right. Amazon wants them to be capped at $9.99. And, you know,
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.040]  hash it and the other book publishers want to be able to sell new titles, you know,
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:43.200]  at whatever price they want. You know, it is, it's pretty complicated. And it's, you know,
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:48.160]  and with subscription coming into play now, it's going to get screwed up again.
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:52.720]  Yeah, totally going to get screwed up again. You know, go back to the early days of Netflix
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:58.960]  streaming when there were less than two good movies to watch. Like that's, that's what the
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:06.000]  book, book rental book subscription services look like. Now imagine how that's going to have to go
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:13.760]  through all kinds of crap now. Yeah. Uh, there's a long article that I haven't posted it during
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:18.960]  firewall yet. I probably will. By the time this, that by the time this podcast comes out tomorrow,
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:22.000]  it would probably already have posted it, but I haven't posted it cause I haven't finished reading
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.640]  it yet by guiding Christopher Wright, who is an author. Um, and he kind of, it's a big long
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.560]  argument, but it's, I think it has to be long because it's complicated. Sometimes, you know,
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:37.920]  when I write an article and it ends up real long, I think, am I, am I just spouting off or am I,
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:42.400]  is it just that complex that it takes a lot of words to describe it? And I think in this case,
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:47.360]  his article is long because it is complex. Um, which is mostly that, you know, hash,
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:51.360]  it is really not looking after readers or authors. They're looking after their own interests.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:55.760]  And Amazon isn't really, you know, doing anything for the benefit of anybody else than Amazon.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:01.760]  And that's just the way it is. And so whoever wins, it's, it's not really going to be a victory
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:07.360]  for anybody, but hash it or Amazon. And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.280]  it's Amazon and it's probably going to be Amazon anyway because hash, it really doesn't have,
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:17.600]  Amazon's the one up, you know, in a position of strength. And the big thing is that the downside,
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:23.840]  you know, the reason that may not be good for us as readers or even us as authors, you and I,
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:29.520]  for Amazon to win, uh, isn't because lower prices are bad because Amazon has a good,
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:33.440]  uh, you know, a couple of good arguments and they're just common sense. One is that an ebook
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:39.520]  is cheaper than a paper version because it does cheaper to send bits than it is to cut down trees,
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:45.920]  turn them into paper and print a book. Uh, and even Amazon has made this argument that because
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.920]  you have fewer rights with a digital version, an ebook, because it's locked by DRM and you can't
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.920]  resell it, you can't give it to somebody else. I can't, you know, you can take it. If you're by
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:00.400]  a paper book, I can read it and then sell it to somebody else. You can't do it with any book.
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:04.560]  And I thought it was interesting that Amazon, which is, you know, the company putting the DRM
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:07.440]  on the books is even making the argument that, Hey, this makes them less valuable.
[01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.200]  Uh, and therefore they should cost less. Um, I think that's a common sense argument and it
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.360]  makes sense. Same way that a paperback should cost less than a hardcover edition because it's
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:23.600]  not as nice and it didn't cost as much to make. Um, and they also make the argument,
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.800]  Amazon, that it's, you know, in, in terms of like authors and royalty that they've shown
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:35.840]  through their own analysis of data that in general, like a book that is an ebook that's
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:44.000]  selling for $15 1499 of course, but call it 15, uh, we'll sell X number of copies that same book
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:54.480]  at $10 nine 99, uh, would sell like 1.7 times as much and therefore make more money and get 70%
[01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:58.960]  more readers. So you'd have more readers and you'd make more money because it would be more
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:05.200]  than the 1.5 that you would need to break even. Um, but that the big downside to the whole thing,
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:11.520]  if, if Amazon wins and they probably will, is that they're building an effective monopoly on,
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:17.360]  on eBooks and that it'll be ripe for abuse. And, you know, everybody will be at Amazon's,
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:22.320]  um, Liberty in terms of, you know, ebook once they locked down the market.
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:28.800]  And I guess another missing part of the equation is what percentage of revenue
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:36.480]  and profits are still coming from $30 hardcover books that, you know, you need to still somewhat
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:43.120]  justify the price for without $10 eBooks. Yeah. One thing I've seen, and I've seen a lot of people
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:48.320]  could be the analogy to the, there's a lot of people are the people on the side that,
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:52.720]  that they should definitely be cheaper and maybe even a lot cheaper eBooks. Um,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.160]  a lot of them are drawing on the analogy that paperbacks are relatively new to the book industry
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:06.880]  and I guess they, they came to be popular in the 1930s. Um, it's not quite the same though,
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.600]  the analogy that it's like a third tier, like that used to just be hardcover additions.
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:15.440]  And then it was hardcover and paperback and now it's hardcover paperback and eBooks.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.840]  Um, the difference that I see though is one of like, what do you call them?
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.400]  Frames, you know, the like opening weekend, what do you call that? Oh, windows, windows. Right.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.800]  Yeah. But that, you know, the way that to my knowledge, the, you know,
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:36.560]  the major book publishers have worked is that new books only come out in hardcover.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:39.520]  Like when Stephen King comes out with a new book, it doesn't come out in hardcover and
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.160]  paperback at the same time. And you can choose to save, you know, half the price by buying the
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.400]  paperback. If you want it when it's new, like when the new Harry Potter books came out and
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.560]  people lined up at midnight to buy them, you had to buy the hardcover, which was the more
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.480]  expensive version and that the paperback came out. It was like home, you know, the same way
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:04.960]  that you can't buy most movies at the opening weekend. You have to wait to get them. And eBooks
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.720]  don't seem to be like that. People want to get, like if Stephen King has a new book and you want
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:13.760]  to read it on your Kindle, you get it on the same day that the hardcover comes out. Yeah. I think
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:20.240]  there was a period where they were trying to not have that available, but I think that that's done,
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:24.720]  you know, they have to do it. And I kind of see how you, you know, that the publishers,
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:28.560]  I kind of see it from the publisher's perspective that they should have a right to charge a premium
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:33.040]  while demand is at a premium. You know, that when the, you know, and again, you could say,
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:37.280]  well, they're just gouging their, the diehard fans, but you know, that's what pays to keep,
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:41.360]  you know, the books coming out. Like, I think if you really want to read it in an opening weekend,
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.480]  you want to read that new, you know, Stephen King novel, as soon as it comes out, they should be
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.880]  allowed to charge $17 for it. And then, you know, drop the price to $9.99 in the long run, you know,
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.040]  three months later, six months later, like same thing, like with movies coming out on home video.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:03.840]  Yeah. And so many markets work like that. You know, and that demand is not necessarily gouging,
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:11.120]  like it's being among the first to get something is too many people worth more money.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:14.960]  Right. Because, you know, if you know, if you're, you know, not that hell bent on
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:18.400]  reading it right away, or you already have a big stack of books in front of you to, you know,
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.760]  that are waiting you to read and you can wait and you know, you're going to pay a lower price
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.680]  same way that, you know, it kind of works like that on iTunes. I don't know if it's on purpose,
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:33.440]  but so many new releases are only available for purchase. And then you can't rent them for,
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.480]  you know, whatever another month or something. Yeah. And they always tell you, you know,
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.480]  available for rent on, you know, September 26. I've found myself buying movies that I don't
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.680]  actually want to own because I don't want to wait a month before they're four bucks.
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.760]  Right. But, and then with a lot of other movies, I've found myself saying, I don't want to buy
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.840]  this. I know I just ran it and I'll add it to my wishlist. I'll come back to it, you know,
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:59.840]  when it comes out for rent. Yeah. I've done the same thing where like, there's some movies where
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:05.360]  I want to see it right away and I know that maybe I'll only watch it once, but I'll pay the 14 99 to
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:13.680]  buy it. Yep. Yeah. So I kind of see the, you know, the thinking there. I'm guessing, I think,
[01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:18.800]  like in those rentals, I know Apple has limits on that, but I, you know, in some movies, some,
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.040]  in some movies too, they cost more to rent, you know, there's, there's new additions that I've
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:28.000]  seen that, uh, it costs five 99 to rent. And I think there's sometimes with the ones that are
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:34.080]  still in theaters, it's six 99 to rent it. Yeah. I think one was like 10 bucks. Yeah. So I think
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.920]  Apple gives the, you know, the studios or whoever it is, you know, if it's like an independent motion
[01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:44.720]  picture, whoever controls the rights to the movie, they give them some pricing control on the rental
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:49.920]  and purchase price. And that's the big thing that sticks. I think in a lot of the publishers cross
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:58.560]  with Amazon is that Amazon wants to just have unilateral control over the price of their stuff.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:04.480]  And that's, it is how Amazon's app store works. You can like set like a suggested price, but if
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:08.480]  when you have an app in the Amazon store, if they decide they want to sell it for 99 cents,
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:14.320]  they just sell it for 99 cents and you get your 30% of that. And I, you know,
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:20.000]  it hasn't had a big effect on the app industry because the Amazon app store is a relatively
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.520]  small player in mobile apps. But in terms of eBooks, you know, the Kindle store is dominant,
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:32.240]  probably, you know, a monopoly. Yeah. Although it's not a monopoly, I think, I think in legal
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:38.240]  terms, it's a monopsony. Right. Which is different and confusing, but I think has different,
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:44.880]  it might give them a lot more leeway in terms of antitrust laws, you know, and that whole weird
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:50.720]  thing that frustrated a lot of us with the Apple eBooks case, which has cost them hundreds of
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:56.240]  millions of dollars in legal fees, where Apple, which had a sliver of the ebook case is the
[01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:01.520]  company that got taken to court by the Department of Justice and lost hundreds of millions of
[02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:09.200]  dollars in fees for colluding with the book publishers and Amazon, the company that has
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:18.000]  the monopsony, the overwhelming majority of ebook sales, you know, is under no, has, hasn't received
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.760]  any scrutiny at all. Here's the dictionary definition. Great work, guys. monopsony,
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:28.960]  a market situation in which there is only one buyer. Right. And that's, because that's the
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:33.280]  thing is that it's not that they have a monopoly on book sales, because there's these five publishers
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.560]  that have all the, you know, it's that they sell the books, not really directly to the customer,
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:44.400]  they sell them to Amazon, and Amazon resells them to people. And that they're really effectively
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.120]  without Amazon, there is no ebook market. I don't know if that's quite true to say, but it would be
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.720]  interesting to see. I've seen very different percentages from very different people when
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.280]  they've published, like how many of their book sales come from Amazon, ebook sales come from
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:07.600]  Amazon versus iTunes and Kobo and who else? Whoever else? Sony, Nook. Yeah, yeah. Yep.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:13.840]  Yep. Anything else? What else you got? Ah, you know, I've just been enjoying the summer.
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:23.120]  I've been, you know, getting in the weeds on a few topics. I think my best post last week was about
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:33.600]  how AOL still has a large profitable dial-up business. I saw that. Actually, I think one of
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.920]  the more interesting posts I've done recently was looking at Google Apps and how successful
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:51.840]  they've been at stealing the startup and growing the kind of mid-size company ranks that, you know,
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:57.120]  should be Microsoft customers for Exchange and all their enterprise stuff. And, you know, Microsoft
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:04.560]  is effectively betting the company on the cloud. Oh, I saw that post. Yeah, I saw that. And that
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:10.160]  was an interesting post. Yeah. So, what you did is you guys looked at the MX records.
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:20.320]  Yeah. So, I picked 150 companies. So, the Fortune 50, so the biggest 50 companies in the United
[02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:24.160]  States. By market cap, right? Isn't that how the Fortune 50 is? Something like that, yeah.
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:30.000]  I think it's market cap. It's either market cap or revenue. Yeah, I think it's market cap. And then
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:37.040]  50 companies from the last Y Combinator class. Those were like the startups, the tiniest
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:44.720]  companies. And then this mid-level tier, which were very scientifically chosen. They were the
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:53.120]  first 50 companies that I thought of that were mid-sized, ranging from Tesla to, so they were
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:59.840]  public and private companies, including Dropbox, Twitter, Tesla. I don't have the list in front
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:06.800]  of me, but companies like that. And of the hugest companies, you know, the ones that were,
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:15.360]  you know, stereotypical enterprise companies. Of those 50, only one of them used Google
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:22.080]  apps for their email, and that was Google. Good job there.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.240]  I laugh, but when I was reading the article, I remember thinking, oh, I wonder who the one is.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:32.800]  Yeah. And I swear to God. And then you say it was Google. I was like, oh, duh. It was like the
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:37.440]  ultimate, it was a type of trick question where I pride myself on being able to think, oh, it's got
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:43.680]  to be Google. And I did not get that. Well, and you know, there's caveats, like maybe some wing
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:48.480]  of one of these companies uses Google apps for some stuff, or maybe, you know, maybe everyone
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:53.120]  uses their personal Gmail at the office. But it's a fair test though, I think.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:04:01.360]  Yeah, it was universal. You know, I looked up the MX records for 150 companies. And so the,
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:08.400]  you know, the startup, the Y Combinator, I think it was like all but four or six of them used
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.960]  Google. That's a little surprising to me too, that it was that high. I mean, it's not surprising,
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:17.920]  it was pretty high. Yeah, it was like 92%. So it was like all but, I don't know.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:25.040]  Because it's not that hard to, you know. 46. So all but four of them
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:29.760]  used Google. And I think one of them might've been used. So
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:35.120]  Outlook was showing up in these results occasionally. So like, you know, theoretically,
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:41.840]  Microsoft's answer to Google apps would be cloud-based outlook. So that was showing up
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:46.800]  in some of them. I'm a little surprised it was as high as 92%. Because it's not that hard to run
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:53.200]  your own mail server, you know, with like a way you run like, you know, that you get a lot of it
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:58.240]  for free from like a web host and sign up for whatever, Dreamhost or something. Yeah. And
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:03.200]  they'll run your IMAP for you. Well, a lot of those web hosts have been kicking that off,
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:11.040]  Google, because it used to be free. And because that's a huge, you know, monkey off their back,
[02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:15.520]  because hosting email is probably not fun for any of those companies in terms of support.
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:20.000]  I'm also surprised, maybe it just speaks to my mindset, but I'm a little surprised that a lot
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.200]  of those companies wouldn't switch off, even if they were using it, when they were at the three
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:30.800]  guys in a garage stage that they didn't switch off once they could, you know, hire like a
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:38.000]  admin, that they wouldn't say, hey, let's run our own mail servers for the paranoia aspect of that
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.280]  an awful lot of those companies have negotiated with Google for like, hey, maybe Google wants to
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:49.440]  acquire us, or maybe we need to work with them. And do you really trust Google? Not Yeah, or even
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:56.160]  security stuff like do we trust Google to? Right. So the most interesting part, though, was the
[02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:03.360]  those mid tier companies. And that's where 60% of them used Google Apps. And that includes Twitter
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:12.880]  includes both Dropbox and box, both of them use Google for their email. And those are, you know,
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:18.320]  as I wrote in the piece, like those would be potential competitors, even, you know, like,
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:26.320]  yeah, Dropbox already probably has an inbox, you know, has pretty good enterprise sales for their
[02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:33.040]  storage services. So maybe they should offer email hosting to who knows. But that was really
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:40.080]  surprising. So it's not that you know, Microsoft still has a huge hold over the biggest enterprise
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:46.480]  customers, but the, the, the growing companies, you know, the Microsoft's future customers seem
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:54.000]  to be really sticking with Google. So we'll see, you know, Microsoft still has, I think, like,
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.920]  90% of the revenue in that in the email hosting market. I think that's what they told me something
[02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:06.960]  around that range, or maybe 95%. And now it's because Microsoft or what's it called IBM Lotus
[02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:12.880]  also still has some so maybe it's like 80% Microsoft, but it's still very strong, dominating
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:19.200]  position. Yeah, but revenue is not important to Google. They're not in the email apps business
[02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:25.440]  for the money. They're doing it for the control, right? You know, the money, Google gets all the
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:31.680]  money they need from search advertising, which is well, but I do think though, I, because
[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:37.200]  everybody knows that they don't they I mean, they've admitted I mean, they'd say that they
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:43.440]  I mean, they've admitted I mean, they'd say that they they scan your email to show contextual ads,
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:50.240]  right related generates money. And from like, I, you know, my being able to scan your email
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:57.360]  to get your to build their profile of you is got to be a huge source of accuracy for the
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.560]  the targeted ads that they show. True. And the fact that you're logging in for your email means
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:07.360]  you're logged in, right? Why are you doing searches? Right. But even beyond that, like,
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:11.600]  my understanding is that they actually are running Google Apps as a business now. Like,
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:16.800]  they're not trying to lose a lot of money on it. Which is one of the reasons they got rid of the
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:23.760]  free tier and that kind of stuff. So, you know, it's it's still I think, less than 10% of I think,
[02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:30.560]  90% of Google's revenue is still advertising, but it's still, I think 10 I think now other is 10%
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:37.120]  or something like that. So growing. But it was interesting. It was, you know, I would, you know,
[02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:42.080]  I was in the command line, like searching MX records, and I would see, wow, this big ass
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:47.600]  company is still using Gmail. That's pretty, pretty crazy. Yeah. And I think that there's a
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.440]  it's hard to make a man understand something that his job depends on him not understanding
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:00.960]  sort of angle to, you know, once a company or everybody had to have email at some internet
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:07.280]  based email at some point in the 90s, it became just, you know, as essential as having telephone
[02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:12.480]  lines into your company. And for a lot of them, they might have already had internal email based
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:17.280]  on, you know, I don't know, whatever antiquated Microsoft or Lotus crap that they had, and then
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:22.320]  had installed gateways to the internet, and it was all convoluted and crazy. But it all required a
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:28.320]  big large IT staff. And then doing it doing anything. Like when you're a startup, not having
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:34.320]  anybody who has to worry about the email server is great, because you, you know, you can concentrate
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:38.080]  on the thing that is you're trying to build. And you can save on your headcount. And it really
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.520]  matters even if it's just one person, because you're leaning meaning you're starting. Whereas
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:46.800]  if you're already the IT staff with a full time it job that you know, Procter and Gamble or
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:51.280]  something like that, you're not going to make decisions on what products and services to buy
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:56.560]  based on, well, now we can we can get rid of us. We can Yeah, right. Right. We can make this choice
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:03.440]  that would obviate the need for our jobs. Totally. Yeah. And so many of those enterprise deals are,
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:08.640]  you know, yeah, you get an exchange server, we also get office license for everyone in the
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.760]  company and windows and all that stuff. So it's a huge deal that's beyond the scope of just email
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:20.720]  and outlook. But, you know, the companies that are starting as three person startups now and are
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:25.040]  growing into, so some of the company, I just pulled up the spreadsheet, some of the companies
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:31.120]  that are still Google customers, you know, were less than 10 people a few years ago. And those
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:41.360]  are like Airbnb, Warby Parker, Tumblr, you know, all these companies are still using Google Apps,
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:47.520]  despite the fact that they are worth billions of dollars. Is Tumblr? Yeah. Isn't that kind of
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:52.560]  crazy? If you think about it, given that they're owned by Yahoo. Yeah. And while they've also
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.480]  maintained a pretty Yeah, but that's still a little crazy. Like they still have their own
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:05.920]  office a little crazy. But yeah, Tumblr. A bunch of boring ones like Etsy does. You know, and one
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:11.360]  of the it's one of those things too, where it's there's no real it's not that you can't migrate,
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:15.360]  but it's a pain in the ass. Because Oh, yeah, totally. You know, you've got to somehow download
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:21.680]  all of your email from Google and put it somewhere and then upload it to the other if like, for
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.320]  example, Tumblr wanted to switch to Yahoo Mail or something like that. And the truth is with that
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:31.280]  one, I looked up what Yahoo itself uses, but I'm, I would bet that it's not Gmail. Right.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:38.720]  I would guess not. But on the other hand, too, is the simple fact that Gmail is objectively better
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:44.640]  than Yahoo Mail. And, you know, it's a good sign. I guess it shouldn't be that surprising. It's a
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.600]  good sign that Tumblr is allowed to stay on Gmail. You know, it wasn't by Yeah, by edict forced to
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:53.840]  do it because it would have been a shit sandwich to everybody at Tumblr. It's like, right. Yeah,
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:58.320]  we're going to Yahoo. Nothing's going to change. Also, your email is going to be Yahoo Mail.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:06.960]  It's like, you know, I quit. I wonder what beats music is on. Oh, good question.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.840]  That's a really good question. No, don't look at them now. But that'd be a good follow up.
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.400]  Yeah, there you go. Because I wonder if they're on Gmail, I wonder if that would be like Apple's
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.040]  ex. Are they still on exchange at Apple? I don't know. No, I don't think they use exchange. I think
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:28.640]  they're just like some, you know, straight straight Unix. I map. I think could be. I could
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:35.440]  look at the headers from an email. Yeah, I know. I don't know if that's here. Here's an email from
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:43.920]  Apple. Apparently, the iWatch is coming on September 9. Where's the show headers? Oh,
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:51.520]  I see Oracle communications messaging server. Yeah. No, that's not exchange. No. Yeah, that's
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:56.480]  what I see to Oracle communication messaging server. All right. So there we go. Good. There
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:06.240]  you go. Oracle. Yeah, it's Larry Ellison. Can you imagine how that deal got done? Yeah,
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:14.480]  there was a yacht involved. Two people. Yeah. You're moving your email to Oracle.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:19.840]  Anything else? What else you got? Cubs are decent again.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:25.680]  What are they? I've missed that. If that's true. No, they're there while they're in last place,
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:31.040]  but they just called up the number one prospect. And so he, he hit a game winning home run his
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:36.320]  first day. His first major league hit was a game winning home run. What is he? What's position does
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:42.880]  he play? Uh, I think he's playing second. I think he's a shortstop. Yeah, I've heard about him.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:46.480]  So I've been watching the games and it's finally exciting. They're not going to be good.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:53.760]  Probably for a year or two. I'm guessing 2016. You got faith. You got faith though. You think
[02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.080]  they're on the road? No, I mean, come on. I I've, I've now gotten to the point where I'm
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:04.320]  just, you know, w we'll see what show me the actual world series. Like NLC, like when they
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:08.880]  were in the NLCS, I was still very skeptical. You know, when you grew up with this, you're like,
[02:14:09.760 --> 02:14:15.840]  and it's kind of spread over into kind of how I see all kinds of stuff, but just we'll see what
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:19.520]  we'll see. We'll see when it actually happens. But it's, you know, exciting to watch because
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.280]  I used to love watching games and they've just been so bad for so long that I haven't even
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:30.080]  bothered. Like I didn't even sign up for MLB TV this year until last week. So do you get a
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:35.840]  discount on that? Uh, no, cause I did the monthly, which I think is always going to be the same price.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:42.960]  But if you sign up for the year, I don't know, but you should. Yeah. Well, it's great. Well,
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.640]  it's a fantastic deal for me. I've said this over and over. I mean, if you, if your favorite team
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.120]  is out of town, it's an amazing deal. If your favorite is in town, it's, it's questionable.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.440]  They should, they should have a different tier. They should have like a tier for people who are
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:00.960]  fans of the in, in game, in town team where you pay less, but you can only watch so many games
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:05.440]  a year because I can, then when you go on vacation, you can watch. Well, what they did
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:11.520]  was the Yankees did a deal with, I think one of the cable providers. So you could
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:17.120]  sign up for MLB TV, but you had to pay through some, maybe through the CA I don't know. It was
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.640]  crazy. It was like, and it was more expensive. I think this is one of those things where we're
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:29.040]  like, these guys are not thinking about their customers at all. And, but it was some weird
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.640]  thing. I think with cable vision, maybe where you could sign up, I don't know. Obviously I didn't
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.000]  do it, but you know, I'll tell you, I don't, I'm not just saying this cause you're a friend
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.840]  and you're a frequent guest on the show. But I mean it is that in the last couple of months,
[02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:50.880]  I, I've found more and more good stuff at Quartz. Yeah. We're, we're trying hard. We we're expanding.
[02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:58.240]  There's an opening on my team. If you want to be a science writer in New York. And we're also
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:03.040]  working on getting someone in San Francisco to write tech for us. So it's, it's great. I really
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:09.040]  like it. You know, I, I, I wasn't really looking for a day job, but I found a great one and I'm
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.680]  really happy there. And there is really good stuff on the site. Yeah. I have a, I have a piece,
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:20.960]  I haven't posted it yet. It's, it will probably be the first post tomorrow queued up by Lily.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:31.440]  Is it Kuo? K U O? I guess so. On Chinese regulation of social media. It's on Quartz.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.320]  On Quartz. Really good article. I thought. I have not read that one yet, so I'm going to have to
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.040]  check it out. Find it on Daring Fireball because then it'll show up in your referrals. Anyway,
