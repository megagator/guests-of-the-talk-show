[00:00.000 --> 00:02.040]  You ever wear out a nail clipper?
[00:02.180 --> 00:03.780]  I can't say that I have.
[00:03.780 --> 00:06.120]  I, you, I, you might've recommended it to me.
[00:06.120 --> 00:09.960]  I moved to the special Japanese nail clippers a few years ago, which are like a
[00:09.960 --> 00:13.220]  practically surgical grade, but I've sometimes wondered, I wondered, are my
[00:13.220 --> 00:13.560]  nails?
[00:13.560 --> 00:14.800]  Am I getting old man nails?
[00:14.860 --> 00:16.320]  Am I getting a nail that's harder to cut?
[00:16.320 --> 00:17.080]  I don't think I've worn them out.
[00:17.080 --> 00:17.920]  Are you running into that?
[00:18.660 --> 00:21.280]  Well, what's this brand of Japanese nail clipper?
[00:21.360 --> 00:25.600]  Sakura, I want to say, can you, we got to get this in the show notes.
[00:25.600 --> 00:27.780]  Cause cause you, you know what?
[00:27.780 --> 00:31.480]  I did the smart thing and I didn't re I didn't like your slippers from Mac
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.000]  Weldon, right?
[00:32.000 --> 00:32.800]  You got to stock up.
[00:32.820 --> 00:36.240]  I've been using the tweezer man brand, which was a really nice upgrade.
[00:36.240 --> 00:40.720]  So what happened to me years ago, many years ago, I was in Las Vegas, Nevada,
[00:40.800 --> 00:42.000]  the city city.
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.200]  I needed to cut my nails as one does in Las Vegas.
[00:46.200 --> 00:49.800]  And I went down to the, uh, the, you know, I don't know what you call the shop.
[00:49.800 --> 00:53.400]  It's the shop of stuff that you forgot and water, right?
[00:53.520 --> 00:55.120]  It's that's a good name.
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.580]  Condoms, aspirin, nail clippers, band-aids, contact cleanse solution, you know,
[01:00.580 --> 01:01.780]  whatever you call that store.
[01:02.020 --> 01:05.940]  And I bought the tweezer man brand up until this point in my life, I'd had no
[01:05.940 --> 01:09.140]  name brand, just regular generic nail clippers.
[01:09.180 --> 01:12.620]  And I got these and the tweezer man ones look like that, but they've got a nice
[01:12.620 --> 01:12.940]  logo.
[01:13.060 --> 01:15.020]  I've used the tweezer man family of products.
[01:15.040 --> 01:15.340]  Yeah.
[01:15.420 --> 01:16.420]  It's a strong family.
[01:16.460 --> 01:21.100]  I have to say it's it, whether it's the placebo effect, cause I had a brand name
[01:21.100 --> 01:26.700]  and because at the win Las Vegas, it costs, I don't know, $15 or something for a nail
[01:26.700 --> 01:27.060]  clipper.
[01:27.820 --> 01:30.700]  It cut my nails much crisper with less pressure.
[01:30.700 --> 01:32.460]  And, uh, just a real
[01:32.460 --> 01:32.820]  Gruber.
[01:32.820 --> 01:34.580]  It's all about finding the right tools.
[01:34.580 --> 01:36.340]  I've discovered a new compost bag.
[01:36.340 --> 01:38.660]  I talked about it for 15 minutes on back to work.
[01:38.900 --> 01:43.860]  I found a new brand of compost bag and it has changed our life.
[01:44.100 --> 01:44.260]  All right.
[01:44.260 --> 01:46.780]  It's amazing how getting the right tool will set you straight.
[01:46.820 --> 01:47.140]  All right.
[01:47.140 --> 01:52.300]  Secchi S E K uh, let me get five if I could please, John, if you allow it, Secchi
[01:52.300 --> 01:55.860]  edge nail clippers, SS one, a six stainless steel finger and nail clippers for men and
[01:55.860 --> 01:59.100]  women, sharp cutting edges for thick nails, professional and home use made in Japan.
[01:59.100 --> 01:59.900]  It's available.
[01:59.940 --> 02:00.900]  I could get it here by Sunday.
[02:00.900 --> 02:03.420]  And as you can see, I like scissors in our house.
[02:03.420 --> 02:06.180]  When you have a young person in the house, you know, the scissors disappear.
[02:06.340 --> 02:06.620]  Yeah.
[02:06.620 --> 02:11.300]  Oh, I've been losing scissors and then all of a sudden then you get six pairs.
[02:11.340 --> 02:16.060]  Well, all of a sudden my son went to college and I haven't lost a single pair of scissors
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.420]  in the last four weeks.
[02:18.220 --> 02:20.740]  We just go through, we would go through this thing though, especially during certain
[02:20.740 --> 02:25.140]  kinds of paper craft phases where there would be six pairs of scissors and then there'd
[02:25.140 --> 02:28.260]  be no pair of scissors and then there'd be six pairs of scissors because mom will go
[02:28.260 --> 02:33.340]  in and go tear up junior's room and discover that like, like some kind of a
[02:33.340 --> 02:37.900]  deranged crow, the person had been unintentionally hoarding all of the scissors.
[02:38.020 --> 02:39.260]  But I think you'll like these.
[02:39.260 --> 02:41.180]  You can get them in toe size or finger size.
[02:41.260 --> 02:43.100]  And I agree with what it says on the thing.
[02:43.100 --> 02:44.580]  It's a smooth and easy action.
[02:44.580 --> 02:49.180]  Well, what happened to me, what I noticed today with my, I like, I keep a downstairs
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.340]  pair of nail clippers.
[02:50.340 --> 02:51.740]  My office is on the ground floor.
[02:51.940 --> 02:56.420]  And what I like to do when the weather is temperate is I'll cut my nails while I'm
[02:56.420 --> 02:57.660]  out walking about the city.
[02:58.020 --> 02:59.900]  Now this is, I think you will understand this.
[02:59.900 --> 03:08.540]  This is a first, a conscientious human being who wants to be a courteous fellow citizen.
[03:08.580 --> 03:10.140]  This is, there's a bit of a dance here.
[03:10.140 --> 03:15.780]  So the one idea is number one, I just, as I get older, I just like to take a walk more
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.140]  and more.
[03:16.180 --> 03:18.180]  Any reason to go out and take a walk, take a walk.
[03:18.220 --> 03:21.860]  Number two, if you cut your nails outside, you don't have any, you don't have to worry
[03:21.860 --> 03:23.500]  about shooting them into a trash can.
[03:23.540 --> 03:25.780]  You don't have to worry about them shooting all over the room.
[03:26.180 --> 03:28.900]  Or a beloved family member finding a toenail somewhere.
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.380]  Oh, that's no good.
[03:30.380 --> 03:32.300]  I mean, I really, that's the beginning of the end.
[03:32.300 --> 03:33.620]  That's going to appear in court papers.
[03:33.660 --> 03:38.060]  Well, and I, you know, and I'm a good family member too, is if I find a toenail in a
[03:38.060 --> 03:42.540]  mysterious part of the house and I'm quite certain it's not mine because I typically cut
[03:42.540 --> 03:46.620]  mine outside and doesn't look like one of mine, I won't call anybody out on it.
[03:46.860 --> 03:49.540]  I won't say, Oh, it's so important.
[03:49.540 --> 03:53.740]  It's you to, to just not notice a lot of stuff about other people in the house.
[03:53.740 --> 03:55.380]  That's just, that's what a gentleman does.
[03:55.380 --> 03:56.300]  I just pick it up.
[03:56.300 --> 03:58.220]  I just, and you can pick up a fingernail very easily.
[03:58.220 --> 03:59.100]  You don't even have to pinch it.
[03:59.100 --> 04:02.140]  You just sort of have to press on it and it'll stick, but I'll go outside.
[04:02.140 --> 04:06.860]  But then the other thing though is let's face it, cutting your fingernails is a personal
[04:06.860 --> 04:07.340]  grooming.
[04:07.340 --> 04:08.540]  It should be done.
[04:08.540 --> 04:11.180]  On the one hand, you don't want to make a mess inside your house anywhere.
[04:11.180 --> 04:14.140]  And on the other hand, you don't want to bother complete strangers with it.
[04:14.140 --> 04:15.420]  You certainly don't want to do it.
[04:15.660 --> 04:17.100]  For example, on the bus,
[04:17.100 --> 04:21.420]  I was, wasn't going to say this cause this is already gross, but I really felt like I
[04:21.420 --> 04:25.180]  had become a resident of San Francisco the first time that I was on Muni, which is our
[04:25.180 --> 04:29.660]  public transit and a lady, a couple of seats over took off her shoes and started trimming
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.220]  her toenails.
[04:30.540 --> 04:31.020]  Right.
[04:31.340 --> 04:32.780]  And I guess I'm the weird one.
[04:32.780 --> 04:36.620]  I was like the Eddie Albert in green acres character where I was like, is this bothering
[04:36.620 --> 04:39.340]  anyone else that there's toenails flying through the train?
[04:39.340 --> 04:43.980]  I don't remember if it was a bad dream or an actual tweet thread from back in the day
[04:43.980 --> 04:47.020]  when this was the sort of thing that was the only thing on Twitter.
[04:47.020 --> 04:51.980]  But I seem to recall somebody seeing some fellow across the aisle on an airplane who
[04:51.980 --> 04:56.940]  was cutting his toenails, not just had his, not just took his shoes and socks off on the
[04:56.940 --> 04:59.260]  plane, but was actually trimming his nails.
[04:59.260 --> 05:00.620]  But that could have just been a bad dream.
[05:00.620 --> 05:05.340]  But anyway, what I will do when I'm out and about is I will only cut my nails when it
[05:05.340 --> 05:09.100]  looks like I'm the only person, you know, in eyesight down the block.
[05:09.100 --> 05:11.820]  And if there are fellow pedestrians coming, then I'll...
[05:11.820 --> 05:16.060]  Is it analogous, if I'm being honest, John, is it analogous to a nosepick in some ways?
[05:16.060 --> 05:16.620]  Oh, very much.
[05:16.620 --> 05:18.780]  It's a thing everybody's got to do.
[05:18.780 --> 05:22.620]  Or maybe like having AirPods in, which I know changes with transparency and stuff.
[05:22.620 --> 05:28.060]  But still, I still feel weird about having AirPods on when I'm like in a store or something
[05:28.060 --> 05:28.940]  like that.
[05:28.940 --> 05:34.620]  But like a nosepick, that's tough to play off legit and you put others in an awkward
[05:34.620 --> 05:35.740]  situation when you pick.
[05:35.740 --> 05:37.100]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[05:37.100 --> 05:38.460]  So you don't want other people to see it.
[05:38.460 --> 05:40.220]  You don't want other people to hear it.
[05:40.220 --> 05:41.260]  It's basic civics.
[05:41.260 --> 05:42.700]  This should be taught in the schools, John.
[05:42.700 --> 05:44.860]  And it's not too hard to find myself on a...
[05:44.860 --> 05:47.260]  You've only got 10 fingers, so I was doing it.
[05:47.260 --> 05:50.540]  But I noticed this the last time I cut my nails, I don't know, a couple of weeks ago,
[05:50.540 --> 05:51.900]  a week or two ago, who knows?
[05:51.900 --> 05:53.580]  I don't really, I don't keep a log.
[05:53.580 --> 06:00.620]  But I'm winding up with nails that look like I bit them as opposed to being cut.
[06:00.620 --> 06:01.820]  They're not, it's not a clean...
[06:01.820 --> 06:05.660]  Oh, see, this is going to be one of those things where you wonder, like, I think most
[06:05.660 --> 06:08.460]  people, and I'll say this because nobody else will say it.
[06:08.460 --> 06:12.060]  I think most people always at some point in their life wondered if they wipe wrong.
[06:12.060 --> 06:15.980]  And I think a similar thing happens with nails where I've never, I don't know if I've
[06:15.980 --> 06:19.340]  ever been taught how to do it where I don't end up with weird angles.
[06:19.900 --> 06:25.100]  Well, no, but this, I'm telling you, this is, it's very clearly dull blades on the
[06:25.100 --> 06:25.500]  cutting.
[06:25.500 --> 06:25.980]  It's not...
[06:25.980 --> 06:29.420]  Well, you should get the Secchi Edge ones because I want to also note here these, I've
[06:29.420 --> 06:30.060]  gotten these before.
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.900]  These are the Studio Series, Jon.
[06:31.900 --> 06:36.380]  So this is like the, this is like the pro version of these, the Studio Series.
[06:36.380 --> 06:40.220]  Well, I'm going to try them and I will, you'll be back on the show at some point and I will,
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.660]  I'll make a note of it and report it.
[06:41.660 --> 06:45.740]  But I, but it occurred to me knowing you were on the show and knowing that you have an interest
[06:45.740 --> 06:47.420]  in the Esoterica, what's the word?
[06:47.420 --> 06:48.140]  I sure do.
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.660]  I mean, it's practically all I'm interested in.
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.780]  As I do.
[06:50.780 --> 06:57.580]  That I honestly, at the age of 49, I cannot recall ever having needed to buy a new set
[06:57.580 --> 07:00.620]  a new set of nail clippers because one wore out.
[07:00.620 --> 07:05.180]  It's eventually, I've had ones that broke, you know, where the lever, the little, you
[07:05.180 --> 07:09.740]  know, in the traditional nail clipper model, the thing that, that flips around for storage.
[07:09.740 --> 07:12.940]  It's one of your, one of your five basic machines, probably in some sense, right?
[07:12.940 --> 07:13.740]  You're a physicist.
[07:13.740 --> 07:14.460]  You know this.
[07:14.460 --> 07:17.020]  I think you're doing now, it's like, I don't know if it's an inclined plane.
[07:17.020 --> 07:19.020]  It's probably at least a lever, right?
[07:19.020 --> 07:20.060]  That's what we're doing.
[07:20.060 --> 07:21.740]  That's, it's ancient technology.
[07:21.740 --> 07:23.900]  It's an ancient Chinese secret.
[07:23.900 --> 07:27.820]  It's ancient technology, but it really does work and it's not like a razor.
[07:27.820 --> 07:30.060]  Like you don't think you're going to like, need to replace the blade.
[07:30.060 --> 07:30.860]  Exactly.
[07:30.860 --> 07:34.300]  But it is exactly though, like a razor.
[07:34.300 --> 07:39.340]  Cause that's a lesson you learn early when you're, for whatever reason, you're shaving
[07:39.340 --> 07:39.820]  your body.
[07:39.820 --> 07:39.980]  Yeah.
[07:39.980 --> 07:45.180]  Like I'm buying Bic razors in college, which I mean like no offense to the Bic corporation.
[07:45.180 --> 07:48.860]  I've enjoyed their pens, but like nobody should be shaving with a Bic razor.
[07:48.860 --> 07:54.060]  It's really, I mean, it's like it was designed to cause problems for you.
[07:55.180 --> 07:58.460]  And you know, there's a thing my lady and I do, and this really is apropos of our compost
[07:58.460 --> 08:00.940]  bags, which I'd be happy to talk about at length, obviously.
[08:00.940 --> 08:04.540]  But we have a thing we've been doing for 20 years called the tiny life improvement project,
[08:04.540 --> 08:08.220]  which is when you try to become aware of things in your life that are causing more friction
[08:08.220 --> 08:14.620]  than they need to, and you make this seemingly like infinitesimal change to something that
[08:14.620 --> 08:15.900]  suddenly improves your life.
[08:15.900 --> 08:19.340]  And that's why I say these goddamn compost bags are changing everything for us.
[08:19.340 --> 08:23.500]  And I'm saying to you, John, when you get the studio series, Secchi Edge, SS 106 stainless
[08:23.500 --> 08:25.980]  steel finger, I think you're going to have a similar thing.
[08:25.980 --> 08:27.820]  I think you're suddenly going to say, I was living a lie.
[08:27.820 --> 08:28.860]  It's like getting a microwave.
[08:28.860 --> 08:30.060]  Like what did I do before?
[08:30.060 --> 08:31.660]  Yeah, I get you.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.460]  Well, I hope so.
[08:32.460 --> 08:33.420]  I just wanted to be even.
[08:33.420 --> 08:37.900]  I just don't want, I don't want one weird, like Robert Evans, like Coke nail.
[08:37.900 --> 08:42.060]  I want them all to be kind of evened out, but then it's like cutting your own hair where
[08:42.060 --> 08:44.300]  you're like, oh, I should probably trim that one more.
[08:44.300 --> 08:46.140]  And like, but pretty soon he got a blood disease.
[08:47.100 --> 08:47.820]  Robert Evans.
[08:47.820 --> 08:51.180]  That's the guy who was the, the paramount, the paramount chief.
[08:51.180 --> 08:52.460]  You bet your ass it was.
[08:52.460 --> 08:55.580]  Did you watch the offer on Paramount plus?
[08:55.580 --> 08:56.060]  I sure did.
[08:56.060 --> 08:57.020]  I sure did.
[08:57.020 --> 08:57.900]  Oh man.
[08:58.460 --> 08:59.340]  I loved it.
[08:59.340 --> 09:04.700]  I thought the guy who was Ozymandias in Watchmen, the guy who played Robert Evans, he was incredible.
[09:04.700 --> 09:06.380]  His voice was amazing.
[09:06.380 --> 09:07.180]  Did you enjoy that?
[09:07.180 --> 09:07.740]  I'm curious.
[09:07.740 --> 09:13.500]  I told Syracuse about it, but obviously it's not a, an according to Hoyle recommendation.
[09:13.500 --> 09:14.460]  Right.
[09:14.460 --> 09:17.660]  But I really enjoyed it for people who don't know the offer.
[09:17.660 --> 09:19.100]  This is part of this modern.
[09:19.100 --> 09:21.420]  It's the type of show that never would have existed before.
[09:21.420 --> 09:22.940]  Cause it was not a movie.
[09:22.940 --> 09:24.540]  It should not have been a movie.
[09:24.540 --> 09:27.660]  It shouldn't have been compressed to two hours, but it was a six part.
[09:27.660 --> 09:29.180]  I believe it couldn't have been much.
[09:29.180 --> 09:30.940]  I don't think plenty, plenty.
[09:30.940 --> 09:35.420]  It was, it was a lot of, it wasn't like Netflix length, but they had room to really spread
[09:35.420 --> 09:35.820]  their wings.
[09:35.820 --> 09:38.060]  You can tell here's one thing before we talk about the offer.
[09:38.060 --> 09:41.980]  One thing I'm starting to notice with these limited run series, we just watched the Dahmer
[09:41.980 --> 09:43.580]  one, which is on Netflix.
[09:43.580 --> 09:44.300]  That one's rough.
[09:44.860 --> 09:48.940]  Well, the wife is a fan of, uh, uh, what's his name?
[09:48.940 --> 09:51.020]  The guy who's sort of the executive producer.
[09:51.020 --> 09:52.700]  He does all the American horror.
[09:52.700 --> 09:53.660]  Yeah, I know who you mean.
[09:53.660 --> 09:57.740]  The guy who does, yeah, the, yeah, the guy who does, uh, all the things, not like that
[09:57.740 --> 10:01.260]  actor, the actor who always, he's getting like a, he used, I just know him from X-Men
[10:01.260 --> 10:05.420]  movies, but like, he's also getting a real career as like, as playing a creep.
[10:05.420 --> 10:11.260]  Ryan Murphy is the show runner, executive producer type and the star.
[10:11.260 --> 10:13.020]  I think he did ratchet too.
[10:13.020 --> 10:15.340]  And he did, yeah, he's done a bunch of stuff.
[10:15.340 --> 10:15.740]  Yeah.
[10:15.740 --> 10:21.820]  Um, anyway, we watched the Dahmer show and, uh, you know, it's got, it had some good,
[10:21.820 --> 10:26.460]  uh, I might not have watched it on my own, but knowing that she wanted to watch it and
[10:26.460 --> 10:27.500]  I'm, I'm a fan of it.
[10:27.500 --> 10:29.180]  And I liked the I'm of the age.
[10:29.180 --> 10:32.540]  Now you've got to be too, where it's like, come on, take me back to the nineties.
[10:32.540 --> 10:32.860]  All right.
[10:32.860 --> 10:33.420]  I'll watch it.
[10:33.420 --> 10:34.540]  Even if it's bad.
[10:34.540 --> 10:36.620]  Things were so much simpler back then.
[10:36.620 --> 10:37.740]  And it was really, it was just bad.
[10:37.740 --> 10:42.940]  Meat Evan Peters, Evan Peters, and also net on Netflix.
[10:42.940 --> 10:47.420]  If you do go to the lonely little Island called Netflix on the Apple TV, where you can only
[10:47.420 --> 10:50.780]  get to it by using your meat fingers to click on the thing and get to it.
[10:50.780 --> 10:54.940]  And it's like, Oh, like which low budget murder thing will I watch tonight?
[10:54.940 --> 10:56.140]  They're always shoveling.
[10:56.140 --> 11:01.900]  Like someone in Sweden was murdered and they, then they try and Netflix does this to, and
[11:01.900 --> 11:07.100]  listen, I don't mean to sound American, a list here, but a lot of times where they try
[11:07.100 --> 11:10.300]  to feed you something that's obviously from Brazil or something.
[11:10.300 --> 11:13.900]  And you're like, I don't know if I want to do Portuguese for 10 episodes, but they'll
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.660]  kind of jam it in a little bit and they get you a little bit.
[11:17.660 --> 11:18.940]  So what did you think?
[11:18.940 --> 11:20.700]  Well, all right, hold on.
[11:20.700 --> 11:23.820]  I'm on, I'm still on Dahmer and I wanted to, that's what I'm talking about.
[11:23.820 --> 11:26.700]  I want to point out that it was a 10 part series.
[11:26.700 --> 11:27.660]  Oh my God.
[11:27.660 --> 11:29.340]  And of course, cause it's Netflix.
[11:29.340 --> 11:30.700]  It's gotta be 10 episodes.
[11:30.700 --> 11:31.020]  Right.
[11:31.020 --> 11:37.500]  And it was my number one takeaway is this would have been absolutely drop dead.
[11:37.500 --> 11:39.420]  Surprisingly, you should definitely watch it.
[11:39.420 --> 11:45.580]  If they had cut it down to five, maybe six, there was five hours of solid content.
[11:45.580 --> 11:49.580]  And the other, it was like, they might as well have just been like breaking in with
[11:49.580 --> 11:54.780]  done, done, done, done, done, and put up a title card that just says Netflix requires
[11:54.780 --> 11:56.220]  everybody to give 10 episodes.
[11:56.220 --> 12:02.860]  I mean, there was a lot of filler.
[12:02.860 --> 12:04.060]  Anyway, it was good.
[12:04.060 --> 12:05.100]  I'm glad I watched it.
[12:05.100 --> 12:06.860]  Wish I would have paid extra.
[12:06.860 --> 12:08.540]  I would have paid a supercharge.
[12:08.540 --> 12:14.780]  I'd upgrade to Netflix premium or pro if I could to get a cut, a professional, a professional
[12:14.780 --> 12:15.340]  cut of this.
[12:15.340 --> 12:20.860]  For a tighter cut, you're going to need Netflix for the enterprise or Netflix ultra Netflix
[12:20.860 --> 12:21.500]  enterprise.
[12:22.460 --> 12:24.300]  That's a lot larger and more rugged.
[12:24.300 --> 12:28.060]  It is funny though, how Netflix does that thing where it really, I mean, I guess it's
[12:28.060 --> 12:32.860]  enough that it's a bit at this point that they seemed when they purchase something or
[12:32.860 --> 12:33.580]  however works out.
[12:33.580 --> 12:36.540]  I don't know anything about the business of this, but whenever something gets made, it
[12:36.540 --> 12:42.220]  does often seem like it is way longer than it needs to be, even when there's a lot to
[12:42.220 --> 12:42.940]  talk about.
[12:42.940 --> 12:49.260]  But what's funny is like, I, for the first time ever, I experienced the opposite of that
[12:49.260 --> 12:50.220]  a couple of weeks ago.
[12:50.220 --> 12:52.780]  Have you seen this movie actually, Amy might love this.
[12:52.780 --> 12:54.700]  Have you seen this movie do revenge?
[12:54.700 --> 13:00.060]  No, it is on Netflix and it's, how do I describe it?
[13:00.060 --> 13:04.620]  It's the way I would describe it in some ways is you know how there is like a kind of a
[13:04.620 --> 13:09.580]  spade of movies in the nineties that were obviously very indebted to or doing an homage
[13:09.580 --> 13:13.100]  to like nineties movies doing like eighties teen movies.
[13:13.100 --> 13:14.220]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[13:14.220 --> 13:14.460]  Right.
[13:14.460 --> 13:23.100]  Well, this is like if Gen Y grew up watching Clueless or Heathers and like it's kind of
[13:23.100 --> 13:25.900]  a, it's obviously a little bit meta.
[13:25.900 --> 13:29.020]  It really feels like one of those kinds of movies.
[13:29.020 --> 13:30.700]  But what's funny is it's a movie, right?
[13:30.700 --> 13:33.100]  It's however long, it's like it's under two hours.
[13:33.100 --> 13:37.420]  It's the first time I ever watched something and went, I bet this started as a pitch for
[13:37.420 --> 13:43.660]  a TV show because the amount of stuff covered in it, it went by, there was so much
[13:43.660 --> 13:47.980]  sort of placeholder stuff about relationships where they hadn't really, as we used to say,
[13:47.980 --> 13:49.340]  sort of earned it.
[13:49.340 --> 13:52.780]  And it's interesting that it goes, I wonder if a lot of folks, and I can't, I don't have
[13:52.780 --> 13:57.260]  a way to prove that's what it was, but my gut is this started as a pitch for some kind
[13:57.260 --> 14:01.900]  of a series, maybe like a Hulu-ish six episode series.
[14:01.900 --> 14:06.700]  And I wonder if people start now just pitching because they know a series is probably more
[14:06.700 --> 14:09.020]  likely you might make more from it.
[14:09.020 --> 14:10.780]  You might get more exposure with it.
[14:10.780 --> 14:11.020]  Yeah.
[14:11.020 --> 14:11.980]  I mean, you ever think about that?
[14:11.980 --> 14:16.060]  Like how TV is like, well, obviously TV is kind of the thing now it's where the prestige
[14:16.060 --> 14:16.860]  is a lot of the time.
[14:17.820 --> 14:18.620]  I don't know, man.
[14:18.620 --> 14:19.420]  It's strange though.
[14:19.420 --> 14:23.340]  It's, and your point though, about the offer is also true.
[14:23.340 --> 14:27.820]  We're like, could you ever have imagined that there would be a TV show about the nominally
[14:27.820 --> 14:29.260]  about the making of a movie?
[14:29.260 --> 14:31.340]  Like you just, you wouldn't, you don't get a lot of that stuff.
[14:31.340 --> 14:31.580]  Yeah.
[14:31.580 --> 14:36.300]  So back to the offer, which is where we started, but it's just fantastic.
[14:36.300 --> 14:39.100]  I'm going to say it's, I would say it's very focused on Albert Ruddy.
[14:39.100 --> 14:39.500]  You know what?
[14:39.500 --> 14:40.060]  I'm wrong.
[14:40.060 --> 14:46.540]  It actually is 10 episodes, but it, the fact that I remember it as being only six episodes
[14:46.540 --> 14:49.420]  shows that it was actually maybe worth 10 episodes.
[14:49.420 --> 14:52.700]  I don't remember, I don't remember that it lagged.
[14:52.700 --> 14:53.900]  So, all right.
[14:53.900 --> 14:56.780]  It is 10 episodes, but it was 10 episodes worth of content.
[14:56.780 --> 15:01.260]  It is told from the point of view of, uh, Al Ruddy, who was a producer.
[15:01.260 --> 15:06.140]  I'd never heard of the guy before a producer on the Godfather and it's how the movie, the
[15:06.140 --> 15:07.740]  Godfather came to be.
[15:07.740 --> 15:08.220]  Right.
[15:08.220 --> 15:15.100]  I will say that my absolute favorite character in the offer was Robert Evans, the studio
[15:15.100 --> 15:22.060]  chief played by, I did not know his name, Matthew Goode, G O O D E, but I, he's been
[15:22.060 --> 15:22.940]  on Downton Abbey.
[15:22.940 --> 15:24.940]  He was in the imitation game.
[15:24.940 --> 15:27.100]  And to me, he's best known cause I'm an idiot.
[15:27.100 --> 15:31.260]  Of course he was Ozymandias in the Watchmen movie and he's totes English.
[15:31.260 --> 15:33.580]  I've I, and he's a secret Brit, John.
[15:33.580 --> 15:34.460]  He's a secret.
[15:34.460 --> 15:35.580]  He's the real deal.
[15:35.580 --> 15:40.380]  It's like I was saying about Evan Peters, like an actor who can really, you just don't
[15:40.380 --> 15:42.940]  even, you might not even know it's the same person.
[15:42.940 --> 15:43.900]  You really might not.
[15:43.900 --> 15:48.620]  I mean, you, who would have guessed that the Robert Evans in this was English, but he steals
[15:48.620 --> 15:51.500]  the show and I wanted so much more of him.
[15:51.500 --> 15:56.140]  I wanted, instead of a movie about the Godfather, I wanted a movie about Robert Evans in this
[15:56.140 --> 15:58.380]  or a show about Robert Evans in the seventies.
[15:58.380 --> 15:59.100]  Can't do that right now.
[15:59.100 --> 16:01.020]  First of all, Hollywood, you don't leave anything on your plate.
[16:01.020 --> 16:02.140]  Like I can't do it.
[16:02.140 --> 16:07.020]  He does net that coked out Robert Evans voice so well.
[16:08.380 --> 16:17.020]  And it is so easy to overact coked out seventies studio executive and perhaps at certain.
[16:17.020 --> 16:17.740]  He had nuance.
[16:17.740 --> 16:19.260]  He brought a lot of nuance to it.
[16:19.260 --> 16:19.980]  Absolutely.
[16:19.980 --> 16:25.100]  And there is without spoiling it, this has to be something that inside the production,
[16:25.100 --> 16:28.140]  they had to acknowledge that's what this scene was.
[16:28.140 --> 16:32.620]  There's a Don Draper scene in the, you know what I'm talking about?
[16:32.620 --> 16:37.020]  There's a meeting and he's not invited, but he comes in anyway.
[16:37.660 --> 16:39.100]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:39.100 --> 16:41.420]  And, and of course he's, he's so charming.
[16:41.420 --> 16:45.180]  And so yeah, he sweeps in and it's, it changes the room.
[16:45.180 --> 16:48.860]  And he pulls it, he really pulls it together and he changes the room.
[16:48.860 --> 16:52.620]  And that's after, I think that's after he'd had one of his like episodes.
[16:52.620 --> 16:53.120]  Yeah.
[16:53.120 --> 16:59.040]  Yeah, it's, it's a really well cast show and it keeps, it keeps moving in a way.
[16:59.040 --> 16:59.920]  I liked it a lot.
[16:59.920 --> 17:00.800]  I would recommend it.
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.560]  And I was sort of dreading it cause I sort of thought like, Oh God, they're just going
[17:04.560 --> 17:05.360]  to wreck there.
[17:05.360 --> 17:07.440]  All this is going to do is wreck the Godfather for me.
[17:08.080 --> 17:08.960]  Right, right.
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.040]  And well, you know, what was weird that was, um, God, I can't, I think I know the character's
[17:13.040 --> 17:13.280]  name.
[17:13.280 --> 17:18.080]  I want to say Karev when the guy from Grey's Anatomy is Brando.
[17:18.080 --> 17:19.520]  It was really confusing.
[17:19.520 --> 17:20.560]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[17:20.560 --> 17:21.280]  He did a good job.
[17:21.280 --> 17:21.440]  Yeah.
[17:21.440 --> 17:22.480]  I think he did a really nice job.
[17:22.480 --> 17:25.200]  Boy, that's tell me that's not a tough, that's not a tough role.
[17:25.200 --> 17:26.400]  Oh, I can't even imagine.
[17:26.400 --> 17:27.200]  How do you do that?
[17:27.200 --> 17:28.240]  How do you play Brando?
[17:28.240 --> 17:32.000]  The guy who played Coppola, I thought he was, he didn't, he's awesome.
[17:32.000 --> 17:33.520]  I liked him in Fantastic Beasts.
[17:33.520 --> 17:33.760]  Yeah.
[17:33.760 --> 17:34.560]  Dan Fogler.
[17:34.560 --> 17:34.960]  Yes.
[17:34.960 --> 17:35.760]  He's fan.
[17:35.760 --> 17:38.640]  He, I was about to say charming in Fantastic Beasts.
[17:38.640 --> 17:39.280]  Yeah.
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.760]  And that was another one of those things where I had no idea who he was as I'm watching this
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.520]  and then watched.
[17:45.520 --> 17:46.020]  Yeah.
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.240]  Something for, and I had already seen Fantastic Beasts and I'm like, Oh, it's that guy.
[17:50.240 --> 17:52.080]  Oh, it's the Baker.
[17:52.080 --> 17:52.560]  The Baker.
[17:54.720 --> 17:56.320]  And I'm like, ah, acting.
[17:57.200 --> 17:57.760]  Yeah.
[17:57.760 --> 17:59.120]  Yeah, it's, it's amazing.
[17:59.120 --> 17:59.440]  Yeah.
[17:59.440 --> 18:01.200]  I'm, I keep thinking about that thing.
[18:01.200 --> 18:04.720]  Jonas texted your wife about how describing your job makes you sound like a deadbeat.
[18:06.720 --> 18:07.360]  You know what I'm saying?
[18:08.480 --> 18:13.440]  The backstory on that is that Jonas went to a school here in Philadelphia that was K through
[18:13.440 --> 18:13.920]  12.
[18:13.920 --> 18:20.080]  So he had shared many of his classmates from kindergarten through his senior year and a
[18:20.080 --> 18:22.160]  new kids would come and go as the years went on.
[18:22.160 --> 18:29.120]  But overall, his friends grew to just sort of understand what Jonas's dad does.
[18:29.120 --> 18:31.920]  And so he didn't find himself in the position of explaining it.
[18:31.920 --> 18:35.200]  But now he's, he's a freshman at college and I guess it comes up.
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.480]  What do your parents do?
[18:36.480 --> 18:44.000]  And yeah, just say he's an arms dealer or something dignified.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  Can I tell you the one time, the first time that his, he came home and said that his friends
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.880]  were in, I don't know, sixth grade, fifth grade, seventh grade, five, six, seven, eight
[18:52.880 --> 18:56.400]  years ago, sometime ago, that his friends actually were impressed by me.
[18:57.520 --> 18:58.560]  I'd love to believe me.
[18:58.560 --> 18:59.360]  I would love to hear it.
[18:59.360 --> 19:02.080]  It was when they found out I had a blue checkmark on Twitter.
[19:02.960 --> 19:04.000]  Oh, sure.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.120]  Then it like blew their tops and me having a Wikipedia entry, which if I could delete,
[19:09.120 --> 19:09.520]  I would.
[19:09.520 --> 19:10.960]  Oh my God, please delete it.
[19:10.960 --> 19:12.240]  I would love to delete it.
[19:12.240 --> 19:13.840]  I've never looked at, I can't.
[19:14.400 --> 19:15.840]  No good will come of that.
[19:15.840 --> 19:17.600]  We're waiting in line outside.
[19:17.600 --> 19:22.960]  One of our few forays a few months ago after things that, well, whatever, we shouldn't
[19:22.960 --> 19:28.960]  get into COVID, but like, you know, you know, we're those people, you know, we're those
[19:28.960 --> 19:31.440]  liberals that get all the shots and wear masks and everything.
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.520]  There was a time when my Wikipedia page was marked for deletion because I wasn't notable
[19:35.520 --> 19:36.240]  enough.
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.920]  And I was like, yes, can I, can, am I allowed to vote for this?
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.200]  I would love to vote for this.
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.120]  But it got voted down and it was anyway.
[19:45.120 --> 19:50.640]  But, but the blue, the blue checkmark was apparently impressive, which I never asked
[19:50.640 --> 19:51.120]  for.
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.160]  That was in the aftermath of Matt Honan.
[19:54.160 --> 19:59.360]  When Matt Honan got hacked very badly and wrote a fantastic piece about, I guess I should
[19:59.360 --> 20:02.960]  put it in the show notes, but I forget where Matt was at the time if he was at Buzzfeed
[20:02.960 --> 20:04.000]  yet or somewhere else.
[20:04.000 --> 20:06.880]  But the social engineering behind that was just so bananas.
[20:06.880 --> 20:10.080]  Yeah, it was, it would almost make like a good caper movie.
[20:10.080 --> 20:11.520]  I would, I would cast Brad Pitt.
[20:11.520 --> 20:14.080]  I still, I still yell at people on the phone.
[20:14.080 --> 20:14.960]  Well, yell.
[20:14.960 --> 20:19.280]  I still am a gog sometimes when somebody reads me a piece of information.
[20:19.280 --> 20:21.440]  I sometimes say, you're supposed to ask me for that.
[20:23.120 --> 20:23.840]  Here's the thing.
[20:23.840 --> 20:27.200]  Have you ever read somebody a piece of private information?
[20:27.200 --> 20:28.720]  And they said, nope, that's not me.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.200]  I mean, that kind of defeats the purpose, but we will.
[20:33.200 --> 20:33.360]  Okay.
[20:33.360 --> 20:37.200]  So we, we, we, we got onto, my kid loves this really good musician, Ricky Montgomery.
[20:37.200 --> 20:40.240]  I went to a Ricky Montgomery concert here in town and it was really fun.
[20:40.240 --> 20:40.800]  Great group.
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.400]  More waiting in line to go in.
[20:42.400 --> 20:47.440]  There's a nice family from Davis, like from kind of like a ways away from here.
[20:47.440 --> 20:48.800]  We had a nice vice visit with them.
[20:48.800 --> 20:51.280]  And of course you get into the, what do you do?
[20:51.280 --> 20:52.400]  How do you spend your time?
[20:52.400 --> 20:53.280]  What's your job?
[20:53.280 --> 20:53.520]  Right.
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.360]  And I went, oh yeah, yeah, stuff for the internet.
[20:57.360 --> 21:02.000]  And my kid in a very loud, clear voice goes, ask him about how he invented the three white
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.120]  guys talking on a podcast genre.
[21:05.120 --> 21:06.160]  I said, thank you, honey.
[21:06.160 --> 21:07.040]  That's really sweet.
[21:08.320 --> 21:10.240]  Also, you know that email thing you misunderstand?
[21:10.240 --> 21:11.280]  That used to be me.
[21:11.280 --> 21:12.240]  Yeah, that was all me.
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.160]  I'm like a two docket of misunderstanding.
[21:15.840 --> 21:20.320]  It came up at one point, Jonas took one computer science class in high school and they had
[21:20.320 --> 21:24.880]  to submit their, their, uh, read me files in markdown format.
[21:25.520 --> 21:30.080]  And I said, you know, I said, you know, and he's, he just rolls his eyes.
[21:31.440 --> 21:33.520]  Like that's such a big deal.
[21:33.520 --> 21:35.840]  I'm like, you should get a better grade for this.
[21:35.840 --> 21:37.120]  Tell your professor.
[21:37.120 --> 21:40.240]  You're never going to do anything that comes close to that.
[21:40.240 --> 21:41.600]  That's it.
[21:41.600 --> 21:42.240]  You're done.
[21:42.240 --> 21:42.880]  I'm done.
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.640]  I'm yeah, I take my hat off.
[21:44.640 --> 21:44.880]  Yeah.
[21:44.880 --> 21:46.080]  I should just end the show.
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.120]  Honestly, you know what?
[21:47.120 --> 21:47.920]  You had a good run.
[21:47.920 --> 21:48.960]  I mean, an okay run.
[21:48.960 --> 21:49.920]  You had an okay run.
[21:49.920 --> 21:53.040]  But anyway, apparently when you go off to college and what does your dad do?
[21:53.040 --> 21:56.160]  Describing what I do is understandably.
[21:56.160 --> 21:56.720]  I've been there.
[21:56.720 --> 21:58.640]  I was like, welcome to my life, kid.
[22:00.560 --> 22:03.440]  But his take was that I sound like a deadbeat.
[22:03.440 --> 22:03.680]  Yeah.
[22:03.680 --> 22:05.040]  He makes dick jokes on the internet.
[22:05.040 --> 22:06.080]  He's all right.
[22:06.080 --> 22:07.440]  He has a podcast.
[22:07.440 --> 22:08.960]  Does not sound anywhere.
[22:08.960 --> 22:12.960]  Doesn't have anywhere near as much cache now as I believe when.
[22:13.520 --> 22:17.600]  Dan and I started, it was 2007, which I it's kind of early.
[22:17.600 --> 22:18.720]  That's possible.
[22:18.720 --> 22:19.120]  Yeah.
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.280]  I looked it up on the, the web dot.
[22:21.280 --> 22:23.600]  Or cause you had a thing before five by five.
[22:23.600 --> 22:23.920]  Was it?
[22:23.920 --> 22:24.320]  Yeah.
[22:24.320 --> 22:24.640]  Yeah.
[22:24.640 --> 22:24.880]  Yeah.
[22:24.880 --> 22:27.360]  We had a, we had like a 30 episode run.
[22:27.360 --> 22:33.360]  He and I started in 2011 2007, I believe like August or something like that.
[22:33.360 --> 22:37.120]  So yeah, I I'll take some credit for making podcasting a thing.
[22:37.120 --> 22:37.840]  I don't know.
[22:37.840 --> 22:38.080]  Thank you.
[22:38.080 --> 22:40.320]  Thank you, John, for everything you've done for all.
[22:40.320 --> 22:43.600]  As they like to say to the vets on Shark Tank, thank you for your service.
[22:43.600 --> 22:46.720]  I appreciate everything you've done for us, but mark down still the best thing here.
[22:46.720 --> 22:46.960]  All right.
[22:46.960 --> 22:48.720]  Let's have some fun here and do a sponsor break.
[22:48.720 --> 22:50.160]  This is going to be, this is gonna be a lot of fun.
[22:50.720 --> 22:51.840]  You can hear it right now.
[22:51.840 --> 22:54.320]  There's music going on on the talk show.
[22:54.320 --> 22:56.560]  Oh, where'd that come from?
[22:56.560 --> 22:56.960]  What is that?
[22:58.560 --> 23:04.560]  If you make video content for a living or do podcasts, you know, the feeling when the
[23:04.560 --> 23:08.800]  feel of your video isn't just right, you can't figure out why maybe a joke doesn't
[23:08.800 --> 23:11.200]  land like it should, or the product demo feels boring.
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.360]  What can you do to find the perfect piece of music to glue it all together?
[23:15.360 --> 23:16.960]  The right music can make people laugh.
[23:16.960 --> 23:18.480]  It can get them excited.
[23:18.480 --> 23:22.080]  It could bring them to tears, but that perfect music can be hard to find.
[23:22.080 --> 23:25.360]  And it's really hard to edit when your client wants changes.
[23:25.360 --> 23:28.720]  What do you do when they say the pacing feels wrong or the drums are distracting?
[23:28.720 --> 23:31.280]  You can't go back and just take the drums out of the stock music.
[23:31.280 --> 23:35.040]  You have to go back to the stock music site and find all together different music that
[23:35.040 --> 23:39.920]  has the same feel as the other one, but with, you know, without the drums or something like
[23:39.920 --> 23:40.400]  that.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.560]  What a pain you deserve better than this.
[23:42.560 --> 23:45.600]  Let me tell you about my pal Alex Weinstein.
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.080]  Alex is one of tech's most prominent composers.
[23:50.080 --> 23:52.160]  Here's why his music feels different.
[23:52.160 --> 23:55.840]  It is handmade and organic with unique textures and rhythms.
[23:55.840 --> 23:58.080]  It doesn't sound like all the other music you hear out there.
[23:58.080 --> 23:59.840]  It doesn't sound like stock music.
[23:59.840 --> 24:04.400]  He has a way of pairing music to your video to make it feel like they were meant to be
[24:04.400 --> 24:05.120]  together.
[24:05.120 --> 24:06.080]  It's an art, really.
[24:06.080 --> 24:07.120]  It really is art.
[24:07.120 --> 24:08.000]  It's music.
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.480]  It's a craft that he's been perfecting for over a decade.
[24:11.360 --> 24:16.560]  Now what you can do, you can just license an existing song or commission an original
[24:16.560 --> 24:21.600]  score, but every piece of music you get from Alex Weinstein can be fully customized to
[24:21.600 --> 24:23.760]  satisfy even the pickiest clients.
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.640]  It's like getting a custom soundtrack at any budget, but don't just take my word for it.
[24:28.640 --> 24:35.520]  Alex's music has been used by companies you know, like Apple, Google, Intel, HP, Slack,
[24:36.320 --> 24:36.880]  Panic.
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.120]  Now we're talking about the big boys when we get to Panic and hundreds of other companies.
[24:41.120 --> 24:44.640]  Now you might be familiar too with a little company called Sandwich.
[24:45.280 --> 24:50.400]  If you've watched videos from Sandwich, you have almost certainly heard music from Alex
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.200]  Weinstein.
[24:51.200 --> 24:55.840]  So let me toss it right here to my pal Adam Lisagor, Sandwich's founder.
[24:55.840 --> 24:59.040]  What can I say about Alex Weinstein?
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.480]  His music is inextricably enmeshed in the Sandwich voice.
[25:02.480 --> 25:04.320]  12 years ago, a guy tweeted at me,
[25:04.320 --> 25:08.480]  Hey Lonely Sandwich, if you ever need music for any of your awesome videos, I'd love
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.680]  to make music for you.
[25:09.680 --> 25:11.040]  That was Alex Weinstein.
[25:11.040 --> 25:15.280]  I answered that tweet and we've been making music together ever since because he makes
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.760]  music that will always take the shape of our stories and elevate them like a great actor
[25:19.760 --> 25:20.800]  or a fine wine.
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.320]  His music isn't like the other music on all those other libraries out there.
[25:24.320 --> 25:28.240]  It's got something special, so you'd be wise to do like Sandwich and work with Alex
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.680]  Weinstein to add music to your video that will make it sing like a fine wine and always
[25:33.680 --> 25:36.320]  be in tune like a fine wine.
[25:36.320 --> 25:37.520]  Back to you, John Gruber.
[25:38.080 --> 25:40.240]  I think I still don't know how to pronounce his name.
[25:40.240 --> 25:42.160]  Ah, I got a mnemonic for you.
[25:42.160 --> 25:43.280]  No, no, no, Adam.
[25:43.280 --> 25:43.780]  Oh.
[25:46.720 --> 25:49.760]  I keep thinking I know and then I keep learning there.
[25:49.760 --> 25:50.400]  I could be wrong.
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.600]  Is that music still going, John?
[25:51.600 --> 25:52.240]  Is it still happening?
[25:52.240 --> 25:54.320]  I feel like all right.
[25:54.320 --> 25:55.360]  Thanks, Adam.
[25:55.360 --> 25:55.860]  Thank you.
[25:56.480 --> 26:01.120]  Now, look, this isn't just for videos and commercials, your events, your films, apps.
[26:01.120 --> 26:03.280]  You could just put music in an app if you need it.
[26:03.280 --> 26:06.000]  And podcasts deserve great music, too.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.160]  Your clients will love this music.
[26:08.160 --> 26:10.000]  Find the right music for you.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.200]  Here's where you go.
[26:11.200 --> 26:22.480]  Alex Weinstein dot com that's A L E X W E I N S T E I N Alex Weinstein dot com slash
[26:23.200 --> 26:24.960]  the talk show.
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.240]  Alex Weinstein dot com slash you got the slug, right?
[26:28.240 --> 26:29.440]  Slash the talk show.
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.040]  He got the slug exactly right.
[26:31.040 --> 26:32.080]  Of course he did.
[26:32.080 --> 26:32.880]  This guy's a pro.
[26:32.880 --> 26:41.680]  Speaking of Adam, when I took this show on my own, 300 some episodes, I believe there
[26:41.680 --> 26:48.000]  was some talk about having a theme song and Adam was the guest and it showed up with a
[26:48.000 --> 26:51.280]  theme song from Alex Weinstein.
[26:51.280 --> 26:53.200]  It was Picking Boogers with John.
[26:54.640 --> 26:56.080]  Yeah, you remember that?
[26:56.080 --> 26:56.880]  I do remember.
[26:56.880 --> 26:57.840]  I remember that title.
[26:57.840 --> 26:59.120]  That sticks in your head.
[26:59.120 --> 27:00.880]  You're saying this kid's not some Johnny come lately.
[27:00.880 --> 27:02.480]  This Alex guy, he's been around for a while.
[27:02.480 --> 27:03.360]  He knows what he's doing.
[27:03.360 --> 27:05.760]  Picking boogers with John Druber.
[27:05.760 --> 27:07.440]  Well, you know why I had to stop using that?
[27:07.440 --> 27:08.800]  A big booger came after you.
[27:08.800 --> 27:12.160]  And yeah, that sort of spoiled it.
[27:12.160 --> 27:13.680]  But yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.400]  What happened is it got controversial because there's, they're called, I forget what they
[27:18.400 --> 27:20.000]  call themselves, but they're like boogerites.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.080]  And what they want to do is reduce.
[27:22.080 --> 27:22.480]  They can.
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.520]  They think it's wrong that there's a stigma against picking your boogers.
[27:27.520 --> 27:29.280]  And oh, I see you.
[27:29.280 --> 27:31.840]  You performed a nasal microaggression, right?
[27:31.840 --> 27:36.160]  And so the gimmick of the theme song, which I would otherwise be using it to open every
[27:36.160 --> 27:39.120]  episode of the show to this day, is that it's funny.
[27:39.120 --> 27:43.120]  And that just is that I'm wasting my time and I'm not very good at this podcast.
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.200]  And you're sitting here picking boogers with me.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.320]  I get my nose picking is not your costume, right?
[27:48.320 --> 27:50.880]  Well, these pro boogerites were very.
[27:50.880 --> 27:51.760]  And I was like, you know what?
[27:51.760 --> 27:53.120]  I think you're wrong.
[27:53.120 --> 27:58.400]  I don't think I think this song isn't good, honest fun, but I don't need the hassle.
[27:58.400 --> 27:59.600]  So I dropped it.
[27:59.600 --> 28:02.080]  Yeah, you got to be careful who you provoke on the Internet.
[28:02.080 --> 28:03.840]  It just it's just not worth it these days.
[28:03.840 --> 28:04.240]  No.
[28:04.240 --> 28:10.640]  Hey, have you played around with the AI image generation tool sets?
[28:10.640 --> 28:15.200]  Well, that was the whole reason that I agreed to be here is I this was a fake.
[28:15.200 --> 28:17.360]  That was a fake question because we know you did great.
[28:17.360 --> 28:19.120]  It was a really it was a really low key segue.
[28:19.120 --> 28:20.000]  You did a really good job.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.280]  We haven't prepared for this or anything.
[28:21.280 --> 28:22.640]  Well, now people are going to be disappointed.
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.400]  No, the truth is I'm here to I'm going to call you out on the carpet, my friend, because
[28:26.400 --> 28:29.200]  you were in my life when you you mentioned.
[28:29.200 --> 28:35.440]  I think diffusion because, you know, any any bail has been talking about this stuff for
[28:35.440 --> 28:36.320]  a while.
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.520]  And I guess you can describe to your listeners what we're talking about if they don't know.
[28:39.520 --> 28:44.960]  But these are apps where it used to be services, I guess, hooked up to supercomputers.
[28:45.840 --> 28:52.080]  And now you can get an app on your Mac where you enter in text and something happens somewhere
[28:52.080 --> 28:52.960]  in the cloud, I guess.
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.360]  And it makes weird AI things based on your text prompts.
[28:57.360 --> 28:59.840]  And boy, this is all happening really fast.
[28:59.840 --> 29:01.120]  It's evolving really fast.
[29:01.120 --> 29:02.560]  But God damn you.
[29:02.560 --> 29:09.280]  I download that stupid app and like it's all I could do for well, I won't say for like
[29:09.280 --> 29:10.160]  weeks or something.
[29:10.160 --> 29:17.120]  But there were times where as someone with ADHD, it was like really difficult to pull
[29:17.120 --> 29:20.880]  myself away, especially once I started going down the rabbit hole of Mike Pence, because
[29:20.880 --> 29:22.160]  that's like a whole thing.
[29:22.160 --> 29:24.560]  But like, yes, I've been playing with these and it's all your fault.
[29:24.560 --> 29:32.160]  So the ones that I'm aware of, I don't know, there's probably going to be more of them
[29:32.160 --> 29:33.920]  than you can shake a stick at soon.
[29:33.920 --> 29:38.400]  The one that first came to prominence was Dolly, which I guess I don't know what it
[29:38.400 --> 29:41.120]  had like, I didn't have like, I was on like some kind of waiting list.
[29:41.120 --> 29:42.640]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:42.640 --> 29:44.640]  And I am not at all skeptical about it.
[29:44.640 --> 29:49.680]  And I kind of know myself well enough to know that I would actually find it fascinating.
[29:49.680 --> 29:54.800]  And so I did get on the list for Dolly, but I never tried to pull any strings like, Hey,
[29:54.800 --> 29:59.520]  I'm the daring fireball guy, can you let me jump the line or, you know, I, you know, and
[29:59.520 --> 30:03.840]  I knew people who were in and I know people who know people over in the Silicon Valley,
[30:03.840 --> 30:08.720]  and I probably could have, but I avoided that because I thought that there goes, who knows
[30:08.720 --> 30:10.080]  when I'll come out of the rabbit hole.
[30:11.680 --> 30:13.920]  And so I be careful what you ask for.
[30:13.920 --> 30:15.440]  I successfully avoided it.
[30:15.440 --> 30:17.680]  And then but then these other ones started coming out.
[30:17.680 --> 30:21.600]  Like there's the one you the one you linked to, I remember specifically really was, I
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.240]  think it was diffusion B, which is the one that I've been using.
[30:24.240 --> 30:29.360]  It's an AI diffusion B is an offshoot of stable diffusion.
[30:29.360 --> 30:30.800]  I will put all these in the show notes.
[30:30.800 --> 30:32.880]  Stable diffusion is the parent project.
[30:32.880 --> 30:38.800]  But the difference with like Dolly is their thing on their servers, and you've got to
[30:38.800 --> 30:39.840]  be in on a list.
[30:39.840 --> 30:43.440]  And now if they're going to open it up as a paid service, and you'll open it up an
[30:43.440 --> 30:48.880]  account and you will only get so many of these queries for you know, the it seems very reasonable.
[30:48.880 --> 30:53.040]  It seems actually like it could be for the time being a good business where they're charging
[30:53.040 --> 30:55.680]  a reasonable rate for a reasonable number of queries.
[30:55.680 --> 30:58.720]  And you get like lower resolution ones.
[30:59.680 --> 31:00.960]  All that I really love this.
[31:00.960 --> 31:02.480]  Can I get it in higher resolution?
[31:02.480 --> 31:04.720]  And then you give them a couple bucks and they spit it out.
[31:04.720 --> 31:07.440]  There's another one called mid journey, which is amazing.
[31:07.440 --> 31:08.640]  I'll talk about that in a bit.
[31:08.640 --> 31:10.720]  But then that's also their thing.
[31:10.720 --> 31:16.480]  They own the software, they own the AI models, and they all have all these groups done their
[31:16.480 --> 31:16.800]  own.
[31:17.360 --> 31:20.720]  And I'm just I'm going to speak freely and just say to you, I don't know anything about
[31:20.720 --> 31:21.440]  any of this.
[31:21.440 --> 31:25.120]  And so I do they do they each do their own like training?
[31:25.120 --> 31:26.000]  Yeah, I believe so.
[31:26.000 --> 31:27.120]  Images separately.
[31:27.120 --> 31:30.880]  It's not like there's one corpus you get from AWS and like, just go at it, right?
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.080]  I'm Yeah, definitely.
[31:32.080 --> 31:32.800]  No, definitely.
[31:32.800 --> 31:33.680]  It's all on their own.
[31:33.680 --> 31:36.320]  I'm speaking a little bit out of my ass here.
[31:36.320 --> 31:46.080]  But my understanding is that there it has been a tremendous area of interest in AI overall
[31:46.640 --> 31:48.400]  for decades.
[31:48.400 --> 31:52.640]  It's been the sort of idea that which part has been the interest?
[31:53.280 --> 32:00.640]  Well, the idea of trying to tell an artificial intelligence like, well, there's the famous
[32:00.640 --> 32:06.240]  Turing test, right, which is just Alan Turing's proposal for artificial intelligence would
[32:06.240 --> 32:13.360]  be that you could have a chat with it, like at a computer terminal, and all you see is
[32:13.360 --> 32:16.000]  text, and you can type whatever you want.
[32:16.560 --> 32:22.320]  And you're it's a one on one chat me and quote unquote, Merlin, and all I see, I can ask
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.280]  you anything I want.
[32:23.280 --> 32:25.760]  And then you can answer with anything you want.
[32:25.760 --> 32:30.000]  And then me the human being, I have five minutes, 10 minutes, whatever.
[32:30.640 --> 32:34.240]  After that, I have to say, Do I think that was a human on the other end?
[32:34.240 --> 32:36.400]  Or was it a computer program?
[32:36.400 --> 32:40.880]  And if I can't tell, then that's that's past the Turing test.
[32:40.880 --> 32:44.880]  And we all encounter I mean, to some degree or another, we've all encountered those things,
[32:44.880 --> 32:45.920]  we all get them.
[32:45.920 --> 32:50.080]  Like if you try to exchange a package with Amazon or something like that, right, you
[32:50.080 --> 32:51.440]  immediately go to some chat.
[32:51.440 --> 32:53.840]  And it's this clearly is a computer.
[32:53.840 --> 32:55.840]  Sometimes you get phone calls from these things.
[32:55.840 --> 32:59.600]  But I mean, isn't a capture capture like things aren't those sort of related?
[32:59.600 --> 33:06.640]  I think that we're asking you, oh, yeah, right, right, it ends up being training, boy,
[33:06.640 --> 33:09.840]  if we're getting a real good idea of what is and isn't a crosswalk at this point, but
[33:09.840 --> 33:14.400]  isn't that part of the idea is that the, forgive me if I'm being dim, that ends up
[33:14.400 --> 33:20.720]  getting used, perhaps, to scan books or to do, you know, whatever AI learning, but, but
[33:20.720 --> 33:24.080]  isn't that whole idea of a capture to say to ask you to do something that's difficult
[33:24.080 --> 33:26.080]  for an automated machine to do?
[33:26.080 --> 33:29.680]  So like identify that this is this and this is that and those kinds of things.
[33:29.680 --> 33:35.200]  It's just, ironically or expectedly, I guess, it's just that we've come a long way from
[33:35.200 --> 33:39.200]  here's some squiggly letters on a weird background because those got solvable.
[33:39.840 --> 33:42.880]  But yeah, the whole evolution of that stuff is fascinating, too.
[33:42.880 --> 33:44.240]  But that's what you're talking about, right?
[33:44.240 --> 33:48.800]  Is like, yeah, same ideas like do show me show me that you can do something that's
[33:48.800 --> 33:49.200]  different.
[33:49.200 --> 33:51.120]  And I think I hope I'm using the right words here.
[33:51.120 --> 33:52.480]  Show me that you can do something.
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.840]  It's difficult for a machine to do automatically like machines can do stuff as long as you've
[33:57.840 --> 34:01.440]  given them the orders, but to pick out of a grid of nine things and say which one of
[34:01.440 --> 34:02.720]  them has a bridge.
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.080]  And I got a lot of bones to pick about what's a bridge versus what's like, you know, an
[34:06.080 --> 34:07.120]  overpass or something.
[34:07.120 --> 34:10.560]  But I think I usually know, oh, here's the three that look like they have, you know,
[34:10.560 --> 34:11.120]  what you want.
[34:11.680 --> 34:17.200]  Well, but you know, most computer programming that we know is even if, you know, you or
[34:17.200 --> 34:21.280]  anybody else listening has doesn't consider yourself a computer programmer at all or
[34:21.280 --> 34:25.360]  if you took a computer programming course in high school and just found it just didn't
[34:25.360 --> 34:26.640]  work with your brain.
[34:26.640 --> 34:27.120]  I get it.
[34:27.120 --> 34:29.920]  We all have subjects where our brains just don't work with it.
[34:29.920 --> 34:34.480]  But even as a lay person, you kind of understand that it's all of programming is really just
[34:34.480 --> 34:39.120]  a traditional programming is just a series of if then else, right?
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.000]  Like so you could write like a simple markdown parser.
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.080]  And if it only supported italics, you would just say, what's the next character?
[34:46.640 --> 34:47.760]  Is it an asterisk?
[34:47.760 --> 34:48.240]  No.
[34:48.240 --> 34:49.680]  Okay, just pass it through.
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.680]  Is it an asterisk?
[34:51.680 --> 34:52.160]  Yes.
[34:52.160 --> 34:52.640]  Okay.
[34:52.640 --> 34:57.280]  Start a run of italics and then keep going until you get another asterisk and then you
[34:57.280 --> 34:59.760]  end, you know, say, okay, now the italics are over.
[34:59.760 --> 35:00.880]  Go back to plain text.
[35:01.760 --> 35:02.880]  Give me another character.
[35:02.880 --> 35:03.440]  What is it?
[35:03.440 --> 35:04.720]  Give me another character.
[35:04.720 --> 35:09.920]  And that's how most traditional computer programs work at a very simplistic level.
[35:09.920 --> 35:12.000]  They're just a bunch of if then else.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  You can't use that sort style of programming to get a full, even a chatbot, right?
[35:20.000 --> 35:20.720]  You can't.
[35:20.720 --> 35:22.560]  There's no way that you can just have.
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.040]  I mean, even just to make it, I mean, like not to be silly about it, but a thing that
[35:27.040 --> 35:32.640]  I run into with almost every flavor of markdown is that at some point I started when you got
[35:32.640 --> 35:35.120]  like a phrase between em dashes.
[35:35.120 --> 35:35.680]  I stopped.
[35:35.680 --> 35:36.560]  I have some point of style.
[35:36.560 --> 35:40.320]  I don't know if it's grammatically correct, but I prefer to not have spaces before or
[35:40.320 --> 35:41.680]  after em dash.
[35:41.680 --> 35:46.480]  But if I have an italicized word, which in this case would be, you know, an underscore
[35:46.480 --> 35:51.680]  or a asterisk on either side, then it kind of botches because it wants the em dash.
[35:51.680 --> 35:53.520]  Yeah, it wants it's greedy.
[35:53.520 --> 35:55.200]  It's greedy for that em dash.
[35:55.200 --> 35:57.680]  You could solve that, though, without artificial intelligence.
[35:57.680 --> 36:00.000]  But I think Brett Terpstra does stuff like that in his sleep.
[36:00.000 --> 36:00.800]  He figures it all out.
[36:00.800 --> 36:05.280]  So another one, here's a very common one that we know that all the big companies, the
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.840]  biggest companies that the world has ever seen are all working on is trying to get
[36:09.840 --> 36:11.680]  robots to drive cars.
[36:11.680 --> 36:12.160]  Right.
[36:12.720 --> 36:19.680]  And you can see how a series of if else type statements isn't going to do it right.
[36:19.680 --> 36:22.960]  It's you need some sort of different way.
[36:22.960 --> 36:25.120]  I use a phrase from the eighties and nineties.
[36:25.120 --> 36:26.000]  Fuzzy logic.
[36:26.000 --> 36:26.880]  Mm hmm.
[36:26.880 --> 36:32.240]  Yeah, that is isn't that isn't that part of it like right is where that lat hook, you
[36:32.240 --> 36:35.920]  don't say last mile, but it's almost like, you know, the year of Linux on the desktop.
[36:35.920 --> 36:40.000]  It always feels like we're about three months away from vehicles.
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.480]  But I think it felt like we were closer to that in some ways, three to five years ago
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.640]  than right now, because as we as that last mile ends up being a lot longer than a mile,
[36:49.200 --> 36:53.520]  exactly what you're describing the training that is involved in getting, you know, what
[36:53.520 --> 36:54.160]  it reminds me of.
[36:54.160 --> 36:59.360]  OK, so this is really going to sound random, but I had a friend whose dad was a cop and
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.840]  was the head of the canine division in our sheriff's department where I was from.
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.280]  And anyway, long story short, he would say he loved Rottweilers and they had a Rottweiler
[37:07.280 --> 37:08.080]  as a pet.
[37:08.080 --> 37:09.840]  And Rottweilers are so interesting.
[37:09.840 --> 37:12.640]  And he, I don't know, he's a cop and he liked dogs.
[37:12.640 --> 37:13.840]  So take it with a grain of salt.
[37:13.840 --> 37:16.640]  But one thing he would always say is like Rottweilers are dogs.
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.760]  They are pack animals.
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.320]  And if they think that you're not being a good leader, they will like you will they
[37:22.320 --> 37:26.560]  will run the house, not because they're mean or because they're trying to annex the
[37:26.560 --> 37:29.200]  Sudetenland, but just because like they're not aggressive.
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.400]  It's just that's how their brain works is that they need that.
[37:32.400 --> 37:35.440]  And the thing he would say, another thing he said that it really stuck with me that
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.240]  I still think about was like you tell so you can tell so much about a given in this case
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.800]  sheriff's deputy based on how their dog acts.
[37:42.800 --> 37:47.360]  That like if it's not a very strong person with good character and who's got clear lines
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.640]  in their life, then that that ends up being reflected in the dog.
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.320]  But the thing he said to me that I still think about the most was something along the lines
[37:54.320 --> 37:58.160]  of the thing is a Rottweiler is like it's almost like a marine.
[37:58.160 --> 38:04.080]  Like it's had the training and the background to know exactly how to follow orders flawlessly.
[38:04.080 --> 38:10.080]  But he says like in the best ones, they also somehow seem to know when to rescind that
[38:10.080 --> 38:11.920]  order and do something else instead.
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.760]  That to me is what separates AI from what you're describing here is if then things because
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.440]  you could have an endless array and nested ways of doing all the defense stuff said the
[38:21.440 --> 38:22.400]  non programmer.
[38:22.400 --> 38:26.480]  But like the idea of an AI taking an AI and saying, hey, here's something we're trying
[38:26.480 --> 38:28.880]  to accomplish and here's the basic rules of the road.
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.320]  Like if you read like in the chess cheating thing, if you read about the ways that there
[38:32.320 --> 38:38.800]  are chess computers now that will do behaviors that are absolutely illogical, every human
[38:38.800 --> 38:40.080]  and yet they win the games.
[38:40.080 --> 38:42.800]  They are the ultimate way of thinking outside the box.
[38:42.800 --> 38:46.160]  And you get into this Kobayashi Maru thing where you start saying like, oh, well, hey,
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.880]  you're you can't beat the test by cheating on the test.
[38:48.880 --> 38:51.680]  And it's like, well, okay, well, you didn't put that in the instructions.
[38:51.680 --> 38:53.360]  And so then you iterate that, right?
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.840]  That's kind of the general idea, right?
[38:55.840 --> 38:56.800]  I think so.
[38:56.800 --> 38:58.320]  Did you eventually get out?
[38:58.320 --> 38:59.040]  You get a Rottweiler.
[38:59.040 --> 38:59.920]  It looks like Mike Pence.
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.800]  I the thing that where I get in over my head is with these with the training that they
[39:06.800 --> 39:07.040]  do.
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.560]  So they take the way that modern machine learning works.
[39:10.560 --> 39:13.440]  And there is again, I'm a little over my head.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  And again, I have a degree in computer science.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.880]  And I took I think I took two courses in artificial intelligence back at old Drexel University.
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.000]  I do believe there actually is a meaningful difference between AI is still the sort of
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.560]  broader parent umbrella for all of this.
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.680]  And machine learning is not just, oh, let's just give it a new name after 20 years to
[39:33.680 --> 39:34.960]  make it feel fresh.
[39:34.960 --> 39:36.560]  It's not just a portmanteau.
[39:36.560 --> 39:45.920]  It's it is a specific way of doing AI, where you throw a gazillion examples into a corpus
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.560]  and train the model so that and so you know that these are
[39:50.560 --> 39:58.720]  all images of dogs 100 million images of dogs and you know that it's a million photos of
[39:58.720 --> 40:04.480]  dogs and you also have a million photos of cats and you throw them at the model and say
[40:04.480 --> 40:05.440]  these are cats.
[40:06.320 --> 40:07.360]  These are dogs.
[40:07.360 --> 40:11.040]  Here's two or you grade the test and say you correctly got this one right.
[40:11.040 --> 40:12.000]  This was a dog.
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.280]  This wasn't a dog hot dog.
[40:13.280 --> 40:19.200]  Well, and then after the model has been trained, then you start throwing new pictures at it
[40:19.200 --> 40:21.680]  and say, is this a dog or is this a cat?
[40:21.680 --> 40:29.680]  And you grade it and when the model and as you correct, the model is like, oh, OK.
[40:29.680 --> 40:35.600]  Oh, and then all of a sudden, the model is actually very uncannily good at even identifying
[40:35.600 --> 40:38.960]  this isn't the killer part of this, the amazing and befuddling.
[40:38.960 --> 40:43.920]  The part that breaks my brain is the idea that it figures out what that route needs
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.640]  to be to get to where you're happy with the results that it's that's the machine learning
[40:48.640 --> 40:51.920]  part, though, right, is it's not that we're there telling it what to do.
[40:51.920 --> 40:54.320]  It's that we're saying more like this, less like this.
[40:54.320 --> 40:58.640]  And like the chess robot that figures out these quackity ways to win at chess, it's
[40:58.640 --> 41:02.960]  thinking, quote unquote, in a way entirely different that way that we would think.
[41:02.960 --> 41:03.440]  Right.
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.600]  And it's it's using heuristics to determine what's a dog and what's a cat that aren't
[41:07.600 --> 41:08.960]  the way we do it at all.
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.560]  They don't they're the logic inside the AI model doesn't work the way the logic works
[41:14.560 --> 41:14.880]  in our brain.
[41:14.880 --> 41:17.120]  And we can't really you can't really see it, right?
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.520]  I mean, yeah, and that's part of this.
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.240]  It's a little scary, you know, and you know, and I know that there are you're in my entire
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.160]  lifetimes ever since 2001 in 1968.
[41:30.160 --> 41:35.440]  There's an entire field of science fiction movies about AI systems gone wrong.
[41:35.440 --> 41:35.760]  Right.
[41:35.760 --> 41:40.000]  I mean, it's it you know, you probably count on one hand the number of science fiction
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.560]  movies, one of those Boston Dynamics projects where the robot rips the doorknob off or
[41:44.560 --> 41:47.040]  something like that, where it's like, well, you told me to open the door.
[41:47.040 --> 41:48.160]  Right, exactly.
[41:48.160 --> 41:49.360]  That company should be put out.
[41:49.360 --> 41:53.840]  But it is a little scary, though, that that even the machine learning experts who make
[41:53.840 --> 42:00.160]  these models that can do ever more amazing things really don't know how they work inside.
[42:00.160 --> 42:00.880]  You know what I mean?
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.800]  Like the internal logic of the system is impenetrable.
[42:04.800 --> 42:10.400]  Because if it were something that that you could then it would spit out like a traditional
[42:10.400 --> 42:13.520]  computer program and you could read then we'd be like, Oh, I see.
[42:13.520 --> 42:15.280]  Oh, we just missed this obvious thing.
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.000]  No, it's like the logic would end up.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.520]  It's more than spaghetti code.
[42:19.520 --> 42:20.000]  It is.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.560]  It's only understandable to a computer.
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.320]  But where they've gone and this to me, it is a leap.
[42:26.320 --> 42:27.920]  It is truly fascinating.
[42:27.920 --> 42:33.920]  And I'm not surprised that it's possible yet, but it still is amazing to see is it.
[42:33.920 --> 42:38.000]  And it feels like pulling the idea inside out.
[42:38.000 --> 42:46.800]  So me throwing a picture of a surprisingly dog like looking cat, it is a cat, but damn
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.360]  if that cat doesn't look a little bit like sort of like a dog and throwing it at a computer
[42:51.360 --> 42:53.360]  and the computer says, Nope, that's a cat.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.960]  And it's like, Ah, that's pretty good.
[42:54.960 --> 42:56.080]  But I'm not surprised.
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.440]  But when you can say to a computer, draw me a picture of a cat that looks like Mike Pence,
[43:01.440 --> 43:07.440]  get off my hard drive in this in the style of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks.
[43:08.160 --> 43:13.680]  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, it looks like Leonardo da Vinci was inventing a feline
[43:13.680 --> 43:15.520]  version of Mike Pence.
[43:15.520 --> 43:17.280]  And it looks like what you asked for.
[43:17.920 --> 43:20.080]  That's on that is mind blowing.
[43:20.080 --> 43:21.200]  It is endlessly fascinating.
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.000]  But you can see, though, why this has been an area of intense research for AI researchers
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.920]  for decades, because as a proof of this is a quote unquote, intelligent system, giving
[43:31.920 --> 43:40.720]  a plain language text string, show me a picture of Donald Trump looking scared and alone in
[43:40.720 --> 43:46.480]  a large office with a can of Diet Coke in the style of Rembrandt reminds me yours remind
[43:46.480 --> 43:48.080]  me of Edward Hopper a little bit.
[43:48.080 --> 43:50.160]  It's like Nighthawks at the diner.
[43:50.160 --> 43:54.320]  All right, I'll try to remember to put some of these in the album art for the episode
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.880]  here so people can look down at your phone as you're listening to us and see some of
[43:58.880 --> 44:03.680]  these images that you and I have generated this one that I have of Trump with a can of
[44:03.680 --> 44:05.120]  soda looking scared alone.
[44:05.120 --> 44:06.640]  It's unbelievable.
[44:06.640 --> 44:10.960]  But you can just give a simple text string not like some kind of Oh, you've written
[44:10.960 --> 44:18.400]  a little computer program and you need to know this crazy this crazy synth or not crazy,
[44:18.400 --> 44:25.760]  but a complicated precise like learning to write SQL database queries code to do it.
[44:25.760 --> 44:27.440]  No, it's like Google search, right?
[44:27.440 --> 44:29.840]  Where you just you don't need to know a query language.
[44:29.840 --> 44:34.320]  You just type a string and you wait and then you get output.
[44:34.320 --> 44:39.040]  And then and like with a Google image search, which the more time I spend with these things,
[44:39.040 --> 44:41.200]  I'm more amazed I am that Google has ever worked at all.
[44:41.200 --> 44:42.000]  It's so incredible.
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.440]  But then you can go through and do your own version of yes, no, yes, no.
[44:45.440 --> 44:50.480]  Like this is this is closer to what I want just in the sense of you know, you we we rarely
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.560]  it just hit the I feel lucky button anymore.
[44:52.560 --> 44:56.560]  Most of us are like kind of browsing around but just to really concentrate on what you're
[44:56.560 --> 45:02.800]  saying there for a second the whole idea of taking us like these a bunch of words that
[45:02.800 --> 45:05.600]  are meaningful and ending up with some kind of an image.
[45:06.560 --> 45:13.280]  That's the fun is you have no idea even if you I've gotten better because based on
[45:13.280 --> 45:18.560]  looking at other people's results I've gotten better at realizing what kind of cues tend
[45:18.560 --> 45:20.480]  to be more or less effective.
[45:20.480 --> 45:22.720]  But like you really don't know what you're going to get.
[45:22.720 --> 45:24.640]  And that's why I went to part two.
[45:24.640 --> 45:28.080]  I wanted to say first of all, screw you for getting me onto this garbage.
[45:28.080 --> 45:29.920]  But also it's so much like gambling.
[45:31.120 --> 45:31.760]  Hold that thought.
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.480]  Well, I will but you don't but like the point is like the if you haven't played with this
[45:36.480 --> 45:38.720]  and that's fine probably have like stuff to do.
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.400]  But like if you've done this, it's bananas the results that you come up with.
[45:42.400 --> 45:46.400]  And it's you can kind of go like, oh, yeah, I kind of I guess I kind of see how you got
[45:46.400 --> 45:47.040]  that.
[45:47.040 --> 45:52.080]  But part of the reason I love it so much is I have no idea what's going to come up what
[45:52.080 --> 45:53.040]  it will look like.
[45:53.040 --> 45:55.520]  And could I even say was this one good?
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.120]  Was this one better than that one?
[45:57.760 --> 46:01.280]  I mean, I guess I could try and give it a grade in terms of but really, it's basically
[46:01.280 --> 46:02.560]  like what I expected.
[46:03.120 --> 46:08.000]  And it's so interesting to see what it comes up with for these incredibly crazy things.
[46:08.000 --> 46:08.880]  It's really addictive.
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.120]  Let me take a break here and let's have some fun and talk about our good friends at Hello
[46:13.120 --> 46:14.480]  Fresh with Hello Fresh.
[46:14.480 --> 46:19.120]  You get farm fresh pre-portioned ingredients and seasonal recipes delivered right to your
[46:19.120 --> 46:19.600]  doorstep.
[46:19.600 --> 46:21.040]  They put it all in a box.
[46:21.040 --> 46:23.920]  The cold stuff stays cold with a little bit of dry ice at the bottom.
[46:23.920 --> 46:25.440]  It's all packed up nice and neat.
[46:25.440 --> 46:30.640]  You skip trips to the grocery store and count on Hello Fresh to make home cooking easy,
[46:30.640 --> 46:32.080]  fun and affordable.
[46:32.080 --> 46:36.000]  That's why Hello Fresh is America's number one meal kit.
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.800]  Do you have a packed schedule this fall?
[46:38.800 --> 46:40.000]  Is it back to school time?
[46:40.000 --> 46:48.560]  Hello Fresh has meals covered with a weekly selection of over 30 recipes and over 70 convenience
[46:48.560 --> 46:51.520]  items, and they are all delivered right to your door.
[46:51.520 --> 46:54.800]  Now more than ever, we're all looking for ways to save some money.
[46:54.800 --> 47:00.800]  In fact, Hello Fresh is 25% less expensive than takeout, and it's even cheaper than grocery
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.480]  shopping too, and they are here to make your hectic fall weeknights a little easier and
[47:06.480 --> 47:07.520]  a lot more delicious.
[47:07.520 --> 47:09.280]  They're quick and easy meals.
[47:09.280 --> 47:10.800]  That's one of their categories.
[47:10.800 --> 47:16.160]  Include a bunch of 20-minute meals with low prep, easy cleanup options, and they take
[47:16.160 --> 47:22.480]  the stress out of mealtime with time-saving, no-fuss recipes ready in a snap.
[47:22.480 --> 47:23.760]  They've got all sorts of new recipes.
[47:23.760 --> 47:25.840]  They always do these seasonal recipes.
[47:25.840 --> 47:32.240]  They also have so many options for stuff like you want vegan options, or if you have allergies,
[47:32.240 --> 47:35.040]  you want to avoid certain ingredients, that sort of thing.
[47:35.040 --> 47:37.600]  It's so many things to choose from every week.
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.240]  You pick what you like, and that's what you get.
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.240]  We've been using them for years.
[47:42.240 --> 47:42.880]  We love it.
[47:42.880 --> 47:44.480]  It is very good food.
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.320]  I love, especially love, the pre-portioned ingredients so that if you need something,
[47:50.320 --> 47:52.960]  you need celery for the thing, they send you enough celery.
[47:52.960 --> 47:58.400]  I like that they send me things that I would never choose or make myself, A.
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.680]  And B, I do always like it.
[47:59.680 --> 48:00.960]  But to me, that's part of the fun.
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.400]  It's like these are dishes.
[48:02.400 --> 48:05.920]  Sometimes I think the ingredients are like, but I like the fact that's nothing I would
[48:05.920 --> 48:08.320]  have clipped out of a magazine myself.
[48:08.320 --> 48:09.200]  That's very true.
[48:09.200 --> 48:14.320]  I feel impoverished by choice sometimes, and I really like being given something that I
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.160]  know is going to be good, but it's a little more diverse and outside what I would make
[48:18.160 --> 48:18.800]  for myself.
[48:18.800 --> 48:19.760]  I'll tell you what.
[48:19.760 --> 48:22.240]  When my wife asked me, what do you want for dinner?
[48:22.240 --> 48:23.760]  What do you want for dinner tonight, tomorrow?
[48:24.640 --> 48:25.760]  I'm so unimaginative.
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.680]  I just think back to the last four meals I've had, and I'll just say one of them again,
[48:30.720 --> 48:33.360]  which is a really dumb way to do it and repetitious.
[48:33.360 --> 48:35.920]  HelloFresh, you get so much variety.
[48:35.920 --> 48:38.400]  You get all the variety you can want, shows up right at your door.
[48:38.400 --> 48:39.280]  Here's what you do.
[48:39.280 --> 48:39.920]  Where do you go?
[48:39.920 --> 48:49.520]  You go to hellofresh.com slash talkshow65, hellofresh.com slash talkshow65, and just
[48:49.520 --> 48:56.720]  use that same code, talkshow65, for 65% off plus free shipping.
[48:56.720 --> 48:57.600]  Oh, come on.
[48:57.600 --> 48:57.920]  What?
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.640]  That's a typo.
[48:58.640 --> 48:59.840]  There's no way that's real.
[48:59.840 --> 49:06.160]  hellofresh.com slash talkshow65 with promo code talkshow65.
[49:07.680 --> 49:08.720]  Those are digits.
[49:08.720 --> 49:09.680]  Don't spell them out.
[49:09.680 --> 49:13.680]  Talkshow65, 65% off and free shipping.
[49:14.640 --> 49:16.320]  America's number one meal kit.
[49:16.320 --> 49:17.040]  That's why they are.
[49:17.040 --> 49:19.040]  I mean, that's just unbelievable, 65.
[49:19.040 --> 49:20.640]  I mean, you'd be a fool not to try it.
[49:21.680 --> 49:24.000]  You said it feels like gambling.
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.240]  I got to say that there is something to that.
[49:26.240 --> 49:28.480]  Like, and I'm not really like a slots player.
[49:28.480 --> 49:31.760]  I've done it, but I can see how people get hooked on the slot machine.
[49:31.760 --> 49:33.360]  Well, I'm just saying, well, I mentioned it.
[49:33.360 --> 49:35.600]  Like I mentioned actually to other friends.
[49:35.600 --> 49:38.720]  I hadn't mentioned it to you, but you're a degenerate gambler, you know, places like
[49:38.720 --> 49:40.720]  Las Vegas and buy nail clippers and things like that.
[49:40.720 --> 49:43.840]  But like, it's, there is this funny thing that, so I'm sitting here with this Studio
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.680]  Mac, which is crazy powerful.
[49:45.680 --> 49:48.640]  And when I'm doing this at home on the laptop, it's not quite as fun.
[49:48.640 --> 49:52.160]  But when I'm, even if I'm doing it at the office with everything else quit, cause this
[49:52.160 --> 49:56.400]  thing is really hungry for Ram and I guess processing, but what is it?
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.000]  But it goes, it's just enough time for me to go, Oh boy, Oh boy, Oh boy.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.600]  And watching the progress bar.
[50:01.600 --> 50:05.280]  And it's exactly like waiting for the cherries to drop and you don't know what's going
[50:05.280 --> 50:06.640]  to happen and you're excited.
[50:06.640 --> 50:07.760]  It's a combination of that.
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.920]  And then something more salient for me is the whole, like, Oh mom, can I just stay for
[50:11.920 --> 50:14.320]  one more music video?
[50:14.320 --> 50:17.680]  Because it might be stand delivered by Adam and the ants or like whatever.
[50:17.680 --> 50:21.280]  Like my favorite video might come on and you went one more, one more, one more.
[50:21.280 --> 50:27.600]  And like, I have to peel myself away from this app because I get so, and then I'll go
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.720]  like, Oh, brainstorm.
[50:28.720 --> 50:29.680]  I should do this instead.
[50:29.680 --> 50:32.000]  I should change the wording to be this way.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.680]  And unlike a slot machine, well, you have a little more agency in that.
[50:37.680 --> 50:39.200]  You're really working for the machine.
[50:39.200 --> 50:42.640]  You're trying to figure out what to say to get what you think you want.
[50:42.640 --> 50:46.720]  And I find that process terribly engrossing.
[50:46.720 --> 50:52.640]  So stable diffusion is one of these systems, but as opposed to the other ones, you don't
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.240]  just go to them and they keep it all.
[50:54.240 --> 50:59.280]  It's an open source thing and an open source corpus, and you can download it all and you
[50:59.280 --> 50:59.840]  can run.
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.960]  It's the first one of these dinguses, these AI image generation things that you can run
[51:06.960 --> 51:11.840]  on your own computer as opposed to running on their server farm somewhere.
[51:11.840 --> 51:18.960]  And apparently it was, so kudos to the project for making it, shipping it, putting it on
[51:18.960 --> 51:20.320]  GitHub and you can download it.
[51:20.320 --> 51:22.240]  But apparently, and it's getting just what it's worth.
[51:22.240 --> 51:25.760]  This one is getting upgrades and improvements at quite a pace.
[51:25.760 --> 51:30.080]  Well, yeah, I noticed after a couple of weeks away from it that the results are already
[51:30.080 --> 51:33.840]  better, but well, they've added, you've got history now, which is huge.
[51:33.840 --> 51:35.760]  And the other one is now you can do image to image.
[51:35.760 --> 51:38.320]  Well, that's just been a, now that's diffusion B.
[51:38.320 --> 51:45.680]  So the price, the parent project is stable diffusion and diffusion B be like the insect
[51:45.680 --> 51:53.040]  is a project by Devon Gupta, who took stable diffusion, took the open source license and
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.680]  packaged it up into just a regular simple Mac app.
[51:57.680 --> 51:58.960]  And now it's very big.
[51:58.960 --> 52:00.320]  It's like two gigabytes.
[52:00.320 --> 52:02.800]  I think it needs to download three last time.
[52:02.800 --> 52:06.640]  So I upgraded yesterday and it was down like the model or whatever it's called was like
[52:06.640 --> 52:07.120]  three gigs.
[52:07.120 --> 52:08.320]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[52:08.320 --> 52:12.960]  It is a lot, but as a user, in terms of the complexity, drag and drop, you just drag it
[52:12.960 --> 52:14.880]  into command shift age in there, right?
[52:14.880 --> 52:20.160]  It's no different than like the complexity of installing BB edit, right?
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.960]  You just download it and you drag it to your applications folder.
[52:22.960 --> 52:27.680]  And it's the only difference is it's got three gigabytes of data to download.
[52:27.680 --> 52:32.800]  And then all of a sudden you've got a regular nice looking Mac app with a text field where
[52:32.800 --> 52:35.920]  you just type whatever it is you'd like to get a picture of.
[52:35.920 --> 52:38.720]  And you hit return.
[52:38.720 --> 52:45.920]  And this is the part that to me is a real interesting and also a real throwback to the
[52:45.920 --> 52:51.920]  early days of me using personal computers, which is in the early days of using personal
[52:51.920 --> 52:58.000]  computers, the most fun stuff was the cutting edge stuff.
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.880]  And it always took forever, right?
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.840]  Copying a floppy.
[53:01.840 --> 53:04.560]  Just going to a BBS to download images.
[53:04.560 --> 53:10.560]  It had a very similar feeling of like, well, this has been described to me in the following
[53:10.560 --> 53:11.200]  way.
[53:11.200 --> 53:15.600]  And then when you wait for the tuck, a tuck, a tuck, a tuck, a tuck, a 9,600 baud modem
[53:15.600 --> 53:16.640]  to like draw.
[53:16.640 --> 53:22.960]  Well, I remember it like the early nineties, like when I was at college and it was still
[53:22.960 --> 53:27.040]  a novelty that the Macs now had full color displays, right?
[53:27.040 --> 53:30.480]  It's like, cause you know, this is the Mac was the black and white computer.
[53:30.480 --> 53:34.400]  And now they had color displays and I had a Mac LC with a color display.
[53:34.400 --> 53:41.520]  And then there, this new image format came out called JPEG and JPEG didn't look like
[53:41.520 --> 53:43.920]  a GIF file or at all.
[53:43.920 --> 53:45.600]  You got real photos.
[53:45.600 --> 53:50.560]  They looked like photographs and you could just download them and open them.
[53:50.560 --> 53:57.280]  But even once you had it downloaded, you could watch a JPEG sort of come into your screen
[53:57.280 --> 54:00.480]  from the top left to the bottom right as it would fill it.
[54:00.480 --> 54:02.800]  And remember there's the progressive JPEG.
[54:02.800 --> 54:05.200]  So that's the JPEG you can such a move forward.
[54:05.200 --> 54:10.480]  So the younger made this file larger by putting crappy versions that'll come in first, but
[54:10.480 --> 54:15.600]  so you got like, you got like the version that you haven't put your glasses on yet first.
[54:16.160 --> 54:21.360]  And then as just so it would fill the screen and then the higher res version would fill
[54:21.360 --> 54:25.680]  in progressive JPEG was actually pretty clever because it did make, had to make the file
[54:25.680 --> 54:30.400]  slightly bigger, but only slightly, but it felt, it felt fast.
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.600]  It felt faster because you got something that filled the full space that the image would
[54:35.600 --> 54:39.280]  eventually fill out roughly just a rough blurry version of it.
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.600]  And then the rest would come in, but just rendering a JPEG would take a while.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.600]  Do you remember when quick time first came out?
[54:46.400 --> 54:47.120]  Sure do.
[54:47.120 --> 54:53.200]  And it, they were like the standard size of postage stamp is the phrase we, I think still
[54:53.200 --> 54:54.080]  used to talk about.
[54:54.080 --> 54:59.760]  They, I think that they were honestly roughly the size of the graphic ads on daring fireball.
[54:59.760 --> 55:00.480]  Right.
[55:00.480 --> 55:05.120]  Those about the size of a, of a, of a 2009 ad from the deck.
[55:05.120 --> 55:05.680]  Yeah.
[55:05.680 --> 55:05.920]  Yeah.
[55:05.920 --> 55:07.520]  Which is still the size that I use.
[55:07.520 --> 55:09.120]  It's really small, little rectangle.
[55:09.120 --> 55:11.680]  And they were, they weren't even 24 frames per second.
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.440]  They'd be like, I don't know, 12 frames per second or 18 frames per second.
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.080]  And with lots of compression, put it on any shared account that at least I had access
[55:20.080 --> 55:21.760]  to your bandwidth would be gone.
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.080]  Even with the paucity of visitors that I had, your bandwidth would be gone in a day.
[55:26.080 --> 55:29.520]  But son of a bitch, we were playing video on our max.
[55:29.520 --> 55:34.800]  And I know somewhere out there, there's our friends who formerly used Amigas are like
[55:35.760 --> 55:37.600]  shaking their fists and they want to yell.
[55:37.600 --> 55:39.760]  We are videos years ahead of you.
[55:39.760 --> 55:40.080]  All right.
[55:40.080 --> 55:40.320]  Yeah.
[55:40.320 --> 55:42.640]  That was five years before that I could make video.
[55:42.640 --> 55:43.360]  It was very cool.
[55:43.920 --> 55:47.120]  Amigas were very cool and they were way ahead of the time and video.
[55:47.120 --> 55:47.920]  So hats off.
[55:47.920 --> 55:48.640]  Was it toaster?
[55:48.640 --> 55:49.120]  Was that the thing?
[55:49.120 --> 55:49.600]  Yeah.
[55:49.600 --> 55:50.240]  Yeah.
[55:50.240 --> 55:50.480]  Yeah.
[55:50.480 --> 55:55.920]  That was the thing that was, that would let you actually edit video at a ridiculously
[55:55.920 --> 55:59.120]  early time compared to the Mac and windows.
[55:59.120 --> 56:00.320]  They were ahead of their time.
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.400]  But anyway, once you could play video on your computer, it was amazing.
[56:04.400 --> 56:09.920]  And like you said, you, but even before you could play this tiny postage stamp, low frame
[56:09.920 --> 56:15.280]  rate, high compression, low color palette video, you had to download it and it took
[56:15.280 --> 56:21.600]  forever and all sorts of things you did would take a long time, but you'd be so excited
[56:21.600 --> 56:24.880]  because you had just gotten the endorphin dopamine.
[56:24.880 --> 56:25.680]  I don't know what it is.
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.240]  I don't know.
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.440]  You would get this, you would get the surge and like if it was actually, if it was the
[56:29.440 --> 56:32.720]  thing you wanted and it looked good and you were, it was, it was magic.
[56:32.720 --> 56:33.120]  Right.
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.240]  And you know, another one was like when music file sharing first became a thing.
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.760]  I, and this was one that I remember having so much fun with Amy.
[56:43.760 --> 56:47.600]  We had like a little home office where she had a desk and I had a desk and I think we
[56:47.600 --> 56:49.680]  were most of our apartments back then.
[56:49.680 --> 56:51.040]  What was your connection like at that point?
[56:52.400 --> 56:53.520]  Like a DSL or something?
[56:53.520 --> 57:01.120]  I think we probably had DSL by the time we Napster and those types of things.
[57:01.120 --> 57:06.720]  I was still on dial up when I, we got, I got DSL when I moved here in 99, but everything
[57:06.720 --> 57:08.320]  I had before that was a haze modem.
[57:08.320 --> 57:08.640]  Yeah.
[57:08.640 --> 57:11.760]  We also had a thing, we had a very cool setup for a while.
[57:11.760 --> 57:18.480]  There was a guy named Peter Sishel as S I C H E L who had a thing for the Mac that would
[57:18.480 --> 57:24.080]  let one Mac be connected to the modem, but would share the connection with over the local
[57:24.080 --> 57:25.120]  network with others.
[57:25.120 --> 57:25.760]  Wow.
[57:25.760 --> 57:28.400]  And it, Amy could get on her computer.
[57:28.400 --> 57:32.080]  I forget what it was called, but I'll try to remember to put it in the show notes, but
[57:32.080 --> 57:37.040]  it was a wonderful piece of shareware, but it was like we could share one modem connection
[57:37.040 --> 57:41.760]  and she could initiate it on her own from her iMac so that I didn't have, she didn't
[57:41.760 --> 57:43.760]  have to go over to my computer if I wasn't around.
[57:43.760 --> 57:46.720]  As long as you remembered it throughout your TCP IP perhaps occasionally.
[57:46.720 --> 57:51.280]  But it was so, and that's what these, the way that everything was so slow back.
[57:51.280 --> 57:55.600]  Remember when you first got Photoshop and at this point, just a few years later, all
[57:55.600 --> 57:59.280]  of a sudden it wasn't a big deal to open a photograph in full color on your Mac.
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.240]  All of a sudden that happened fast, but like doing something.
[58:02.240 --> 58:06.240]  I still remember when like Adobe would have like the picture of the like kind of geisha
[58:06.240 --> 58:07.040]  looking woman.
[58:07.040 --> 58:11.760]  And like when I first got onto, I think it was illustrator three was so confusing in
[58:11.760 --> 58:14.160]  some way it was, I don't want to say it was illustrator three, but one of the, there
[58:14.160 --> 58:19.200]  was an illustrator circa 92, 93, something like around that time where you could have
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.640]  it in two modes where it was almost like what we think of now as wireframe, bezier curves
[58:24.640 --> 58:25.440]  or whatever.
[58:25.440 --> 58:28.480]  And then when you wanted to see what it's actually going to look like, even let's just
[58:28.480 --> 58:30.160]  say like, John, am I exaggerating?
[58:30.160 --> 58:35.280]  If you want to see how your gradient turned out, like go get a coffee and come back.
[58:35.280 --> 58:36.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[58:36.480 --> 58:37.280]  Right.
[58:37.280 --> 58:37.520]  Right.
[58:37.520 --> 58:39.040]  And you could just watch it.
[58:39.040 --> 58:45.680]  It would render it as it went, but it would just be like, like a phantom hand just painting
[58:45.680 --> 58:46.880]  it on the screen.
[58:46.880 --> 58:48.560]  Like a very fast for a painter.
[58:48.560 --> 58:51.520]  Also women wore skirts and the movies were a nickel.
[58:51.520 --> 58:53.920]  But yes, you would, there would be steps.
[58:53.920 --> 58:59.200]  You'd go from wireframe to full output and there would be steps where you could go take
[58:59.200 --> 59:01.680]  a bathroom break or something like that.
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.120]  All sorts of stuff took lots of time.
[59:03.120 --> 59:07.760]  I remember when you'd print a complex page layout from Quirk Express, just translating
[59:07.760 --> 59:13.760]  it all to postscript and sending it over to my image writer, like doing draft versus a
[59:13.760 --> 59:14.160]  good.
[59:14.160 --> 59:15.200]  Oh yes.
[59:15.200 --> 59:19.920]  Oh, when I was finally, I would always print out in draft and it would be all jaggy because
[59:19.920 --> 59:23.040]  I was usually using New York and they would, of course it will look amazing once I did
[59:23.040 --> 59:24.000]  it on the laser printer.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.480]  But yes, yes, absolutely.
[59:26.480 --> 59:28.320]  There were so many things like this.
[59:29.600 --> 59:31.440]  Does it make you feel a little nostalgic?
[59:31.440 --> 59:33.360]  I got to wait a second to see the cool thing.
[59:33.360 --> 59:37.040]  Well, like no more than a second, though, like a minute or 30 seconds, I don't know.
[59:37.040 --> 59:43.680]  And then you'd realize now, and it's exact same feel to me where you're like, oh, it's
[59:43.680 --> 59:47.360]  same thing with Napster where you're looking and we would just play the game like, oh,
[59:47.360 --> 59:48.480]  what about so-and-so?
[59:48.480 --> 59:51.840]  There's music we haven't heard since we were, it was the mid-80s.
[59:51.840 --> 59:53.200]  Let's see if we can find that.
[59:53.200 --> 59:56.720]  And then you find somebody, some, what was the term, was it Node?
[59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.240]  But you'd find somebody and be like, oh my God, this person has the same music taste
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.720]  I do.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.400]  And they have all these obscure records.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.520]  Yeah, they've got more of it.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.120]  Or they digitized their LPs, right?
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  Because there was only so many, I guess what we call like maybe seeds today, like you would
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.000]  go real slow.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.800]  And if they decided to use the phone, done.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.760]  They just disappear.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.520]  But these AI image, and then you realize you typed slightly the wrong string or something
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:25.920]  and you're like, ah, that's not, I thought that would get me something in the style of
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.800]  Norman Rockwell.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.240]  But it's like, oh, I see.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.960]  Instead of saying style of Norman Rockwell, you say illustrated by Norman Rockwell.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.520]  And all of a sudden it looks like a Norman Rockwell.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.960]  You know, I might be.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:37.440]  No, no, no.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:38.880]  It does.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.960]  Well, again, it's difficult to know.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.280]  We don't have a, I don't have a baseline.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.240]  So I don't have a way of saying if I just enter in Mike Pence, and if it's not clear,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.760]  I'm obsessed with the way Mike Pence looks in AI generated art.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:52.880]  I'm utterly obsessed with it because he's a very comical character to me.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.360]  And it's funny to see him with three breasts and four arms.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.240]  But yeah, changing the order of things, changing.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.960]  I discovered this when I went to another one of those sites.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.400]  Oh, shoot, it's something.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.040]  I want to say, I'll find it for notes, but there's a, another one of these places that
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.240]  collects a whole bunch of these.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.600]  And I would see what other people were using for prompts and how contrary to how my brain
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:13.840]  works.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.400]  Yet another thing I don't understand sometimes providing, it isn't like making a short
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.800]  prompt is going to give you a faster result.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.600]  That's just counterintuitive.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:28.080]  In fact, an extremely detailed one that looks like SEO jamming.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.160]  Remember, you know, when you try and cram keywords, like, and make them FFF, so nobody
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.560]  could see them, like all those cheesy ways of trying to leverage SEO, putting a ton of
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.600]  stuff in there.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.680]  It might take just about as long and you may or may not get a better result, but this is
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:42.560]  how they get you.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.520]  This is how they get you.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:49.040]  Like, it's just like gambling, but you now I'm involved because as much as I seem like
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.560]  a monkey hitting a button, the changes in what I choose for the prompt end up having
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.160]  an impact on it, which is exactly the kind of lizard brain crap that totally appeals
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.000]  to me and a lot of other people.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.080]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.880]  I really do.
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.760]  For those of you, I did link to Diffusion B a few weeks ago on Daring Fireball.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.600]  I know a bunch of people downloaded it.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.400]  It is a very fun way to get started.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.240]  It is very satisfying to know it's running on your computer.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.280]  It is getting better at a noticeable clip.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.440]  I would say it is remarkably better one month later, which is not so.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.640]  It's one of these things that just turns on a part of my brain that starts pumping out.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.000]  Give me more.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.280]  Totally agree.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.040]  The lighting up part is really true.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.880]  It's like I would struggle.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.600]  Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of friends, so I don't have to explain why I'm spending
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.400]  all the time on this.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.800]  But if I were going to try to explain to somebody, I and I've said this, I think the Syracuse,
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.960]  I was saying like, part of what I find so appealing about this is how I don't say how
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.280]  bad it is, but how weird it is and that there will be something there that my brain
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:01.280]  my cognition can recognize is a certain kind of thing.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.480]  But again, if it has an extra arm or something, you get into this weird, almost like at least
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.160]  I don't know how I know how my dreams are.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.920]  I don't have dreams that are easy to tell as a story because it can be very visual,
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.600]  but it's very based in feelings.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.360]  And of course, nobody likes being told a dream.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.640]  But the kind of imagery, the closest thing I could think of, I think I mentioned this
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:21.600]  to you is reminds me of the paintings of Francis Bacon.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:25.360]  So if you look up, what's the famous one, Francis Bacon, there's this one called Painting
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.560]  1946, where it kind of looks like a side of beef dressed as the pope, like the stuff that
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.160]  guy was doing for paintings.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.520]  It has a lot of that.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.720]  I started doing things with Show Me Mike Pence hanging out with Cthulhu.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.120]  And it did surprisingly well at that.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  It's the dreamlike quality of not, I mean, you can enter a string of text.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.040]  How can I put this?
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.680]  You're not going to reverse engineer this from somebody else's art.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.560]  Like if you go in and enter a prompt and get 10 results from it, it could be shocking how
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.320]  different and how extremely weird some of them are.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.960]  And then the contra that, then one out of every 15, you'll be like, wow, that's really
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.080]  normal looking.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.880]  Like I did one, there's a, oh, again, Mike Pence, but I was doing funny bits involving
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.680]  the X-Men.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.200]  And there's an artist I like a lot who's on Twitter, whose name is Bill Sienkiewicz.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.160]  He did stuff like Daredevil and Elektra and stuff.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.200]  I did, I'll send this to you.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.240]  I did one, blah, blah, blah, Mike Pence and the X-Men as drawn by Bill Sienkiewicz, something
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:22.720]  like that.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:29.280]  And I would never say this to the man himself, the great man, but like of all the AI ones
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.360]  I've ever done, it was the most that kind of looked like what I expected.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.040]  And that became interesting too.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:40.720]  It's not just when Mike Pence and Cthulhu have an odd number of arms, but there is a
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.080]  very interesting dream logic.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.920]  And I think this is part of, without getting too far into the, for me anyway, without getting
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.880]  too far into the rat hole of like, what does this mean for the future of art?
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.560]  There's something weirdly stimulating about it, even if this is not going to go create
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.680]  a logo.
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.920]  They talk about this on ATP, so I'm skimming some of this from them, but I'm not going
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:05.520]  to go in there and have it design my icon app for me, but there is something thrilling
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.080]  about it that's difficult to describe.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.400]  And that's kind of the point is that you're going, you're seeing stuff that nobody else
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.600]  is ever going to see again.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.120]  Here's two I just sent you.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.920]  Donald Trump.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.600]  These are, I got from Diffusion B.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.120]  I think Donald Trump is for you, like Mike Pence.
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:21.680]  Yeah, he is.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.840]  He's my, he's my, my...
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.880]  He's your bet noir.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.840]  Yeah, my bet noir.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.480]  He is.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:34.480]  Because Donald Trump, graffiti, black and white, style of Banks, style of Banksy.
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:37.040]  These are two that I got that I just loved.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.320]  I especially love the bottom one where I'll try to put this one in the...
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.640]  Because sometimes it will, you'll see that letters, you can recognize something as, oh,
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.320]  whatever this is based on had letters in it, but it'll be like, you know, almost like the
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.840]  teachers in a Peanuts cartoon.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.080]  You'll see something that looks like, this is the closest to like the real letters that
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:56.720]  I've ever seen.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.920]  It looks like the word Trump.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.200]  Yeah, it's, and he's got a hat that covers his eyes and a mustache that's over the top
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200]  of his nose, but you can tell it's him.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.960]  Totally.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.200]  Yeah, it is amazing.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.120]  Let me squeeze in another sponsor right here.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.880]  These, I love this company, man.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.280]  Oh man.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.480]  Do you ever hear of the Memberful?
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.160]  Oh, Memberful.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.120]  I've totally heard of them.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.280]  You know, I utilize them on both sides of the table.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.080]  Yeah, I was about to say...
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.160]  I spend money on Memberful and money comes to me via Memberful.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.520]  You monetize your passion with Memberships.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.560]  I do that, yes.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.280]  Memberful allows anybody, you listening, not you, Merlin, but anybody out there listening
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:40.000]  out in podcast land, you can build a sustainable recurring revenue through Memberful.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.320]  It is the easiest way to sell Memberships to your audience and it is used by some of
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:49.040]  the biggest and best, like Merlin, creators on the web.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.040]  They have everything you need to run a membership program, including custom branding, gift
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:57.040]  subscriptions, Apple Pay, free trials, private podcasts, tons more.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.680]  The best thing I can say about those, the people I know who run Memberful sites are
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.040]  very happy with it.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:10.080]  And me as a customer, I'm very happy as a Memberful subscriber because it is everything
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.520]  you want where you're supporting.
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:14.560]  I love giving people money to do stuff I'm bad at.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:18.560]  I love giving money to the niche people who...
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.400]  You know who doesn't need more of my money?
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.040]  Who?
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.920]  Disney, right?
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.040]  Oh, that's true.
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.800]  They've gotten way...
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.920]  I've gotten enough of my money.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.760]  They got their nut.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.400]  Whoever the hell owns Paramount Plus doesn't really need more of my money.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.840]  They've gotten a lot of it over the years.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.640]  But they are...
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.840]  Shine heart wig company.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.960]  My favorite stuff that I consume when I look back at my week's media consumption, my favorite
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.360]  stuff comes from the stuff that I remember and the stuff that I feel was actually nourishing
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.280]  for my mind comes from independent producers.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.280]  And even if it's just entertainment, it's still, it feels more...
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.480]  It's what I want to support.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.400]  And the way you can support it is through Memberful.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:03.120]  And if you're the type of person who makes independent media out there, you can use Memberful
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.720]  to offer memberships to your audience.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.560]  You can get started for free with no credit card required.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.120]  I subscribe to a bunch of Memberful sites.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.440]  What do you run that's on the Memberful there, Merlin?
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.320]  Some off the dome.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.040]  Like, that's what we use at the podcast network, where Sirkusa and I have a show.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.480]  I use it to...
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.480]  I'm pretty sure of all of these.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.200]  Six Colors and Jason and Dan and that team and Matthew Casanelli.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.800]  Yeah, the shortcuts wizard.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.840]  Yeah, shortcuts fella.
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.640]  Yeah.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.400]  Yeah, I am a fan.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]  And look, I'm not trying to be cute about it.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.600]  I'm being dead serious.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.960]  Like, I don't make my own catch-up.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.800]  I don't have my own brakes and I don't handle my own money stuff.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.520]  Like, I'm so happy to have somebody else...
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:48.640]  John, these kids today, they're not going to remember that around the time that you
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:53.040]  and Amy were sucking down all those Tom Petty bootlegs in your room.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.880]  Like, it used to be...
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.600]  This is the reason that Terrible Man runs the car company now.
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.920]  It's because it used to be hard to do money things on the internet.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.840]  And to this day, I mean, just the stuff you've got to deal with...
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.120]  Think about when you sell t-shirts somewhere and you've got to deal with the vat and all
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:09.760]  of that.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.840]  Having somebody else handle that stuff and then on top of it have these value-added services.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.600]  Things that you can do through Memberful.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.280]  I'm not here to stand for Memberful.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:19.920]  I'm just saying.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.600]  It's a good thing.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.160]  If you're making a thing...
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.280]  And I don't use the word content.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.160]  I don't use that word.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.000]  But if you're making stuff and you want a way to put a cash register on it, check them
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.160]  out.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.200]  Where do people go for that?
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.480]  Go to Memberful.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.200]  M-E-M-B-E-R-F-U-L.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.640]  Just like the name of the company, you're saying.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.520]  Memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.560]  Just slash talk show.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.440]  They don't use the the.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.560]  But that's okay.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.560]  I talked about that with Paul Kefasis last week.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.200]  That's okay.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.160]  It's all okay.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.080]  As I get older, I hope this is true for all of you out there listening.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:54.080]  I don't want to be one of these old people who gets more close-minded as they get old.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.760]  But it makes you appreciate it more when somebody calls you the right thing.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.800]  It makes you appreciate it.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.600]  Respect.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.200]  That's why they carry their groceries home.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.280]  Memberful.com slash talk show.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.000]  Go there today.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.480]  Check it out.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.280]  Start your thing.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.000]  All right, Merlin.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.800]  I'm now here's the part of the show where I might be putting our friendship at risk.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.280]  Okay.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.560]  I've been friends for a long time.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.600]  I want to tell you, I get the feeling that you're not familiar with mid journey.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.080]  Oh, well, no, I'm not.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:27.280]  From your Apple note here, it sounds like it involves Discord, and I find Discord confusing.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.320]  All right, so do I.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.480]  I find Discord very confusing and cacophony.
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.320]  And by confusing, I mean overwhelming.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.120]  I do, too.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.640]  Oh, get ready to be overwhelmed.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.920]  So let me tell you about mid journey.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.960]  Mid journey.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.240]  That's a cool name.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:45.360]  Mid journey is an AI image generator, and Ben Thompson used it for something and got
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.440]  really interesting output from it.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.800]  He told me I should check it out.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.640]  Now don't go look now, for God's sake.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.680]  Now this is where it got confusing to me.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.800]  Now that you're worried you'll lose me.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.760]  Oh yeah, you'll be gone.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.320]  You'll be here.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.120]  You'll be gone.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.920]  You won't be back till Christmas.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.840]  You'll be lucky if you get your Christmas shopping done.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.960]  So you go to mid journey.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.280]  It's free or it can be free.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.720]  You can then pay to get better access, but you can just sign up for free.
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:12.400]  But it was very confusing to me because I went there and I said, OK, I would like to.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.520]  Ben says I should try this.
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:14.320]  I'm going to try this.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.040]  And you try it and it says, here's your access to Discord.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.640]  And I was like, well, I didn't want to be on the mid journey Discord.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.880]  I find Discord is very confusing.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.080]  How do I just want the mid?
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.800]  I thought I was just signing up to get access to mid journey.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.480]  And I figured that I would be.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.400]  That's a pretty I've run into that a handful of times where to like get in on like to get
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:38.160]  a beta of something or whatever you do it like through a Discord.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.840]  Yeah, that's well, it turns out that there is no like mid journey website where you get
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.320]  a credential like a username and password and you type things in their website and then
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.000]  the website gives you images.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.240]  No, Discord is the interface through which mid journey works.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.200]  And so what happens is they just give you access to their Discord and there are these
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.320]  channels in the Discord for newbies.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.880]  I don't know what they call them, but you're a new user.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.480]  You haven't paid for anything.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:16.160]  And you get into one of these channels and you just start typing like commands and they're
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.120]  relatively simple.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:22.000]  It's a little bit like a command line interface where it's like you say, like, I'm going
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.920]  to get the syntax wrong, but like using a command line interface in the sense of that
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.960]  there's like attributes, like there's verbs and nouns and like flags.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.840]  Yeah, well, like, yeah, it'd be like a new image.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.800]  And then you just type like these other ones, new image, Donald Trump eating a mouse, and
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.760]  then you hit return.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:40.960]  Yeah.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.880]  And it takes again, it still takes like 30 seconds for your things to come back.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:52.880]  And it comes back on mid journey with a like a little four square, one, two, three, four
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.240]  with four versions, which might vary greatly of what your prompt was.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.680]  And then you can pick one of them like, Oh, number two, I like and I forget what the command
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.680]  is, but it might be like M two and M two would say, take number two and do another revision
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.080]  on that.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.920]  And they'll give you another more like this.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.280]  And then when there's one that you really like, there's you just say like, Oh, that's
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:15.680]  the one.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.680]  Give me a higher resolution of that one.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.320]  And then it gives you a higher resolution of that one.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.520]  And each one takes I don't know, maybe 30 seconds, I here's where it blows your mind.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.560]  This is where it is absolutely bananas.
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:34.800]  And I might this might be the last episode of my podcast where I have my full listenership
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.840]  because some portion of the people out there will I you're going to be if you've never
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.520]  tried to lose them, they're going to disappear into mid journey.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.640]  Because while you're doing this, you're in a public discord channel with people from
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:52.240]  all over the world doing the same thing in your channel.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.840]  So as a free user of mid journey, whatever it is you're making is not private, it is
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.080]  on their channel, you can pay them and subscribe.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.280]  It's like you pay like 200 bucks a year, I don't know something like that.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.280]  And then you can get a private access to mid journey where you can type things that nobody
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.360]  else can see in their discord.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.000]  But while you're learning it, you're in a public channel.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.440]  And it's not just one channel with all 40 million people using it around the world.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:25.840]  They somehow automatically keep only I don't know, a couple dozen people at a time in one
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.720]  of these channels, but you see what they're making, and what they're typing.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:35.440]  And these are people who are all way better at it than me, right?
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.920]  Because I've never been here before these they know like they know like the incantations,
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.280]  they know the incantations.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.520]  And you can see their incantations as they type them.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:53.400]  And then so while you're waiting 30 seconds for your incantation, to give you your results,
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.180]  you're watching theirs flow by in the channel, oh my gosh, and discord is it turns out to
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:00.760]  be wonderful for this.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:05.440]  It's the first it's discord went from a thing that I never wanted to use and never enjoyed.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.840]  God bless all the other sites out there that have discords.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.360]  I know some people like it, but I find it my brain is too simple and too easily confused
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.280]  and intuitive place to do something.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:18.640]  But while you're waiting for your results, you see these amazing results from other people
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.020]  and occasionally unamazing results.
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:26.320]  But you also got to see and you can scroll back to see what they typed to make it.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.840]  And these results are amazing.
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.920]  And then your results come in and you're Oh, that's kind of neat.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.560]  Give me more on number three or do number three, but give me four more for four different
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.400]  takes on number three.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.980]  And now you're waiting again.
[01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:45.800]  And while you're waiting, all these other results are streaming by and then next next
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.920]  thing you know, it's tomorrow and your wife, your wife is like, where were you?
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:57.360]  And you're like, ah, but if this word gambling, I'm doing, um, whatever slots and you're playing
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.640]  craps like you're playing a community game.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.840]  Let me give you a better now, you know, I love the gambling, but I'm going to give you
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.940]  a better analogy.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:12.760]  To me, it is like discovering coin up video game arcades when we were young, where it
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.300]  is because it's there's the money is incidental, right?
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.300]  And it's like gambling.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.300]  You can suddenly lose your money.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.740]  Whereas in an arcade, you kind of spend your quarters at an even clip, but you let unless
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.480]  you're playing the Star Wars sit down game, they're all going to be a quarter.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.940]  But like when you would discover like the first time maybe you're on vacation, maybe
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.960]  a new arcade opened at your mall, but like the first time you found a new arcade and
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:40.280]  you could tell it was a good one because it was big and they had not just a game you'd
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:46.720]  never seen before, but multiple games you had never even seen before and you're waiting.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.640]  You wanted to play donkey Kong, but somebody who's really good is already there and they've
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.600]  already got a bunch of quarters up on the thing.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.040]  So you know, they're going to be there a while.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.360]  So you just walk the aisle and you can watch other people play games.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:04.560]  And in the same way that maybe you'd see a game that you had tried before, but you were
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:09.760]  never very good at it and the Oh, there's, here's a girl who's playing Galaga and she's
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.120]  really good.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.120]  What is she doing?
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:19.920]  Oh, I never thought to move around like that asteroids watching someone else play asteroids.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.000]  I was like, Oh, it had not even occurred or in that matter defender like games where you're
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  like, I had no idea that that was a thing that I could defender was now it makes sense.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.480]  Spider was an incredibly difficult game, just saying, and of course Stargate, but like you
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.040]  would learn, like hang out in this area, wait for this thing to happen, go into the stargate,
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.680]  do this thing that, you know, it's like, yeah, it's centipede was like that centipede was
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.680]  a very fun game.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.480]  I enjoyed the novelty of the track ball and it had really cool sounds, but I would die
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.440]  very quickly and I didn't want to squander my quarters.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.160]  And then I'd see somebody who was good at it and say, Oh, you can kind of hide there
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.360]  when that spider drops down and you're once you, the spider is only going to go that direction.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.240]  So once you get past it, you can, yeah, I get it.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:07.780]  And that's what it's like hanging out in this mid journey discord where except there are
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.360]  no quarters, you can just keep going forever.
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.880]  And there's, you can't really run out like no matter how cool the arcade and how many
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]  new games they had.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.320]  Eventually you either looked at them and decided, ah, I don't even want to play that or you
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.640]  tried them all.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.320]  Whereas in this, it's like an endless stream of new games.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.560]  Keep getting Dolly carted into the arcade.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.560]  Right.
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.560]  Oh my.
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.560]  And there's no people aren't griefing.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.920]  Like it's a cool community.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.440]  Like my time there was nothing.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.840]  I would say nothing, not even vaguely inappropriate and it doesn't seem like anybody.
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.000]  There's some commentary between people like, Whoa, that's really cool.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.160]  Can't believe you did that.
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.760]  Never thought to use that syntax.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.880]  There's a little bit of that, but for the most part, it's just people typing images
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:54.800]  in and at least my time there, which was, I don't know how many hours, but it was too
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]  many.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]  I don't want to know.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.760]  I didn't see anything that I wouldn't have wanted a teenager to see.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.080]  I don't, and I don't know how much of that is that their training model blocks stuff
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.520]  that would be violent or terribly sexual or something like that.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:12.720]  I didn't see anything inappropriate and I can only imagine that the, it's probably not
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.880]  as bad as a lot of zoom calls for our school, but they're still finding a way in, but I
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]  think that's so valuable.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.400]  You get to be like the AI senpai, like you get to be there and follow along.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.320]  I mean, and not to try and make this practical, but like there is also this aspect of what,
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320]  why would you do this?
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.320]  What is it for?
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.160]  And like, well, you know, we've asked that about a lot of stuff in the past, but, and
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.480]  sometimes some of us get a nose for going like, I don't know what this, like, I don't
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.560]  know how this becomes the next job.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.880]  I didn't know how it would become a job in 1993 to make a web page or 94 to make web
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880]  pages.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.080]  And somehow it did kind of, you know what I mean?
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.720]  Like, but it's, I think it's going to be crazy interesting and we don't have anyone
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.400]  your time to talk about it today, but what, there's so many things where I used to look
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.480]  down my nose and go like, Oh God, really?
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.600]  Like you're worried about robots rights and you think all these things and like, but more
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.240]  and more, I will, once I actually learn something about something like this, I go, Oh, now I
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.080]  understand what the big deal is, but also I understand why this is a complicated thing.
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]  It is all the people.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.960]  And again, they talked about this on ATP, but all the people on who's, if you're in
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:16.880]  the corpus, like you may be like, Hey, like you can't use my, my drawing to do that or
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.880]  whatever.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880]  It's not a business.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.680]  And as everyone, we try to predict the future.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.240]  I think like, we don't even know what we don't know yet about this.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.240]  That's that could be a whole episode.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:31.660]  I thought about that whole can of worms of the ethics of this and Charlie Warzel illustrated
[01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.760]  a piece in his galaxy brain newsletter a month or two ago, probably closer to two months
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.440]  at this point, where his hero art for the, this issue of the newsletter was an AI generated
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:45.960]  picture of Alec, uh, dipshit info Wars.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.920]  I did some good Alex Jones, Alex Jones.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.800]  It was a really good Alex Jones.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.280]  And his idea was, look, the rules of his newsletter at the Atlantic is that there's gotta be a
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:58.840]  hero art thing at the top and they have an access to Getty images and he can type out
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.840]  the hero art.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.040]  If I understand correctly, John is talking about when you have a primary large image
[01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:07.080]  on a page that will then also be used in stuff like a card on Twitter.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:12.400]  And yeah, almost every website other than mine does it with every post or sites.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.680]  It's not about Safari tabs.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.680]  You're not interested.
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.680]  Right.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:21.240]  And the thing was, I don't want to just get one of these stock images from Getty photos
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.400]  from Getty images of Alec Jones, which have all we've all been used before.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.360]  And his budget wasn't such for each issue, you know, like you pay, I don't know what
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:34.340]  they pay Getty for that 150 bucks or something like that or whatever for a licensed photo.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:39.600]  He doesn't have the thousand dollars it would take to commission a human artist to draw
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.820]  an original piece of art that wasn't even an option.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.360]  And people freaked out that him using AI generated art and it was really good.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.260]  It was really the tone of it was amazing.
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:54.440]  And he took it to heart and followed up and took it all on the chin and said, look, I
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.480]  wasn't really thinking like that, but I'm not going to do it again.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.760]  I'm not going to use this again.
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.240]  And what were the objections were that was it the whole you're going to put artists out
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:05.160]  of exactly more or less to encapsulate a complex argument into something?
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.920]  Yeah, I'm not trying to be reductive.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920]  That's the nature of it.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.960]  But I think that saying I'm not going to use that I won't do this again is so is going
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.280]  to look so foolish because everybody's going to use this.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:17.760]  And it's if you're an illustrator, I don't think you're going to be put out of business.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:23.080]  But you know, I think human illustrators are going to have to twist their styles into a
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.080]  direction that the AI systems can't replicate.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.080]  Right.
[01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:30.940]  And so it there's will quickly I think we'll get to a point where everybody will recognize
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:34.240]  the AI generated ones no matter how original they are.
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.240]  But it is what it is.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.240]  You can't put this is toothpaste that can't go back in the tube, right?
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.940]  Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.120]  It's like file sharing, right?
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.800]  We could talk about how it's wrong and it's putting musical artists needed to get paid
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.760]  and blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.160]  But it's you can't put it back in or we could talk about how Spotify and Apple Music don't
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.780]  pay artists enough from this the streaming the 10 bucks a month you pay to your service
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.780]  of choice.
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.200]  Not enough of that music goes to the artists that might be
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.300]  in the news and the newspaper where I was a clerk in 1988 doesn't sell as many copies
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:03.300]  in right.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:04.300]  It's okay.
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.300]  But yeah, that's true.
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.300]  That's a really good point.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.640]  It is what it is.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.600]  You've been that you've what was your when you have those stories about going the paper
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.980]  used to work out where you go in the morning and you could see all the like the copies
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:17.400]  being sent out and I'm not trying to say I'm not trying to be unkind at all because you
[01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.460]  know, we all have to contend with all of these things.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:24.660]  But a lot of times there are opportunities to it's just that we can't you're not a Toyota
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:25.660]  plant.
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:30.420]  Yeah, you can't be just retooled into like, oh, now I make stuff that's better than AI.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.140]  Like I don't know what the answer to that is.
[01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:36.200]  But I do know that it's there's probably a pretty good chance the answer is not make
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.200]  this go away.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.440]  Yeah, it's that's not the answer.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:42.000]  And there is the question of the training, right?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.580]  And if these millions of model of images that went in to feed the models, how are those
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:46.940]  people being compensated?
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:51.500]  I guess that doesn't seem like I mean, you'll remember along with me that in the early days
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:55.020]  of the web, like you think about when like photographers first started putting up their
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:58.440]  portfolios and within about a week, we're like, forget that.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.600]  And so you get to like the wedding photographers style, like watermarks, everything.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.220]  It's like, hey, you have this food, I already pooped on it for you.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.460]  Like, I don't know if that really stopped them.
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.040]  And now today, probably in AI could probably fill in all the places where there was slightly
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:14.040]  transparent letters.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.680]  But like, I'm not saying that to be unkind or say, oh, book up.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.680]  It is what it is.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.680]  But look at this.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:22.660]  You've let's say you're an up and coming musician in our of our generation.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:28.040]  We heard everything from the Beatles and the Stones and the Who and the Kinks.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:34.040]  And if that those bands really were your jam, how in the world is what they did not going
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.480]  to infuse what you're making?
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:37.480]  Absolutely.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.480]  Yeah.
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.360]  Or whatever generation musician you are, the music operating, I mean, except in certain
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.040]  kinds of non-western music, we're all operating with the same 12.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.040]  Right.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:48.040]  It's it.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.720]  And that's the same thing with these image things.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.400]  But anyway, mid journey, you're, I want you to check it out.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.960]  You're going to well, I'm telling you, though, be careful, though.
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.000]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  Maybe set a timer.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  You got to go.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.240]  I know we have a limited amount of time, but now there is a part of me that thinks you're
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.440]  just trying to ditch me because you want to go get back in the back in the future.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.600]  Well, let me take one more break.
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.040]  I've got one last break to make here.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.160]  And it's for my very best friend here.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:11.160]  Squarespace.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.800]  Oh, I'm wearing a Squarespace shirt.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.700]  Oh, my God.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.700]  You know what?
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.700]  Hi.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.700]  I'm that guy.
[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:19.960]  Look, Squarespace.
[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960]  You know what it is?
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.200]  It's the all in one service.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.200]  You go there.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.200]  You can read everything.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.120]  Register the domain, pick a template, tweak the template, put your entire original design
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]  in.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]  If you can do that.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]  Jon Store.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.120]  They give you a store now.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.120]  They give you a store.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.120]  You're trying to make a store, Jon?
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.040]  You go out and you get, oh, I got a ploned fork that'll let me accept dirt coin.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.520]  No, this is like a whole thing.
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520]  It actually works.
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520]  And they give it to you with the website.
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  It's nuts.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.160]  And it's just there.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:54.020]  Analytics just built in understandable, actual human understandable analytics to see who's
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.400]  coming to your site.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.000]  Where are they going on your site?
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.260]  Where are they coming from?
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.280]  Which sources are actually throwing traffic to your site?
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.520]  All this stuff you need to update your site and keep it going.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.840]  And if it's like a blog on your site, you post through Squarespace.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.380]  The actual CMS is all there.

[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:42.880]  Speaking of watermarks.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:47.680]  Speaking of watermark, you know, I have a podcast that I've been doing for 10 years.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:49.040]  It's always been on Squarespace.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.280]  You can do a podcast on Squarespace.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:51.280]  You can do a store on Squarespace.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.720]  They got the SEO.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.360]  I give Squarespace.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.480]  You didn't ask, but I give them my official okey dokey, just like Colonel Potter.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480]  I've got about...
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.120]  Are you going to dinner?
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120]  What are you doing?
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.280]  Your kid's gone, you have no excuses.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.280]  It's a long story.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280]  I got it.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280]  Okay.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  All right.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280]  You're a long story.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280]  But I want, I did not want to let this episode end.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.520]  I knew that once it's almost like getting into the mid journey thing or give me a full
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.520]  42 seconds.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.520]  Yeah.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.520]  I want it.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520]  I go way back, John.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.800]  I want to talk about your wisdom project.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.800]  Tell people what it is.
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.920]  I have a thing up on, on the GitHub, which is now repo.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.120]  It used to just be a gist, but a repo, that's just, you know, friend of the show, John
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.120]  Syracuse.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.120]  And it's kind of long story short.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.240]  It started out as a challenge on Dubai Friday to like, I think we were learning how to use,
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240]  I want to say craft.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:36.320]  It might've been obsidian, but probably craft.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.560]  We like to do challenges that involve playing with apps.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.520]  I started this thing where like, how do I describe this?
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520]  What?
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:48.400]  No matter how I put this, it sounds really strange, but it was basically to share, cause
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.840]  you know, I used to be in the South help bracket.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:53.200]  I don't know if you know that back when I was, remember that we remember we did that
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.000]  to talk to the people like the South by Southwest about Jawa blogs.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.520]  You know what that, you know, that just came up.
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.240]  Remember the guy we saw on the, in the alleyway?
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.240]  I surely do.
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:05.240]  I made a joke about him on the internet just yesterday.
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.160]  I was just had dinner with some friends who had a meeting with him and, and I thought
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160]  of you and I thought, this is great.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.160]  Was he in the bag?
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.160]  Be honest.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.160]  No, he was not.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.160]  I asked, but he was not.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:20.600]  Cause I think at one point he actually said something along the lines of Robble, Robble.
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.720]  He was, he was drunk as hell, John is what I remember.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.720]  Yeah.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.540]  Well sometimes there's good polls and bad polls.
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:30.120]  But the idea was I wanted to start, I dunno, let's set aside for a minute how I'll start.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.280]  The point was I wanted to write down, start writing down, capturing a lot of the stuff
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.160]  that's become sort of instrumental things I've learned.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.160]  Not because I'm dead or not because I'm old, but just because I thought it'd be a fun idea
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:45.080]  to like take up the advice that has helped me over time.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.160]  And you know how writing is where sometimes you start with one thing, you end up with
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.160]  a different thing.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.680]  However it started out, what I ended up with was having a receptacle in which to put, in
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.360]  which to write something, which is a fun thing for me to get back into, but also to have
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.600]  a way to feel like here's all the little bits of stuff that I've learned over time.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  Things that people used to say to me.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.760]  It's intended as something like advice, but really more.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.620]  It's also a, not confessional in the sense of Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell, but confessional
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:16.880]  in the sense of like, Hey, I've screwed up a lot of stuff and I started screwing up this
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:22.480]  particular thing a little bit less when I learned this thing or understood this thing.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:26.640]  A way of changing my, I mean the very first one is sometimes an email is just a way to
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:27.640]  say, I love you.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.640]  Well, okay.
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.640]  Genius.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:30.640]  What does that mean?
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.200]  Well, what that means is when I get all mad about email and all the people who are bothering
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:36.960]  me with email, like, man, don't be a dick.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.680]  Sometimes people are just checking in.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:41.840]  Sometimes people ask how you're doing when they're actually worried about how they're
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.880]  doing.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.840]  That took, did you know that when you were 12?
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.060]  No, I didn't.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:49.420]  Your kids are little versions of themselves, not little versions of you.
[01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:50.640]  Did you know that when you had a kid?
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640]  I didn't.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640]  And it's not stuff.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:56.320]  I'm not trying to like be snooty and high minded about it, but it is really fun as a
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.960]  writing project, but it's also, you know, it is, it's like, once you start carrying
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:04.480]  a notebook, you know where we write stuff down, it sounds silly until you start doing
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.480]  it.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:09.680]  But it's nice because it's become like a, just a big bucket for a lot of ideas.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.600]  And the more time I spend on it, some of it not public, I want to spend more time on the
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.600]  writing of it.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.840]  And I have ideas for things to do with it, but yeah, it started out as just kind of a
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.300]  lark right now, some advice and all full credit to you.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:23.360]  It's all because of markdown.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.640]  I never would have gotten any of this done if it wasn't just basically the markdown version
[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.560]  of a very long UL.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:34.560]  That's very kind of you.
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:37.180]  I appreciate that, but that is anything else.
[01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:42.280]  If I'd done this in Scrivener, we'd have two items on the page, nothing against Scrivener,
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.320]  but I have a, I will fiddle.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.720]  If I have a way to fiddle, I will fiddle.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:50.120]  That's sort of why I made markdown honestly, I get it.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.000]  That is extremely edifying to me.
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.600]  I've heard that sometimes most, for the most part, people use markdown to write blog posts
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.700]  type things on the internet, which is what it was.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.360]  But occasionally people have other projects that use it.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.560]  And when they thank me, I'm always incredibly edified because that's, and they always say
[01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:11.440]  the same thing because it gets out of your way and it gives you something that you cannot
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.360]  put you, you can't fiddle with.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.680]  It's very kind of you to say that.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:20.480]  I want everybody, I could sit here and just read, read these and then we'd be here for
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.480]  another hour.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.480]  Did you actually read it, Jon?
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:23.480]  Did you find any that you liked?
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:24.480]  I, I love all of them.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.480]  See, I could tell.
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:26.480]  I could tell you didn't even look at it.
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.480]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.480]  No, bullshit.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.600]  No, I'm above that at this point.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.600]  I really am.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:34.080]  I like the ones, you know what ones, I like the ones and, and I don't know how you order
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:35.080]  them.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.080]  I don't even want to know.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:40.120]  I don't think because they're not necessarily categorized together, but I like the ones.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:44.560]  The challenge is figuring out how to keep them sewn together.
[01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:50.080]  Is it, but the thing is, John, you know, what's not in Markdown and extended taxonomy for
[01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.420]  converting things into EPUBs, that's a different project, right?
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.420]  New line, new line.
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:58.920]  And you're not, you're not tagging each item with a bunch of tags.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.920]  They're just, every time I feel like doing that, I say, go write 10 more.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.120]  I like the ones that deal with clutter.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]  You've got one.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.960]  I don't have, I don't have any of them.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:11.160]  Be careful how much stuff you warehouse with the idea that someone might quote want it
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.160]  someday.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.840]  I've got one that did just like it, perhaps if you have trouble keeping up with, say your
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.480]  dirty dishes, perhaps you have too many dishes.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.320]  And that is a very clever insight.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.400]  And my, I have a sort of hoarder gene.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.120]  My mom, I worry is the way to solve this problem is more forks.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.120]  No, it's not.
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.760]  That's not the way to solve this problem.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.480]  When I was in college, we had to eventually go to something that this'll probably go in
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:34.480]  there at some point.
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:38.120]  We called the one fork role, which is like when we reached a certain point of three 20
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.960]  year old men living in a room and living in a house together.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:44.420]  We had to like call lockdown basically rank, rank, all the clock songs are going off because
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.440]  we're going into one fork mode for the next week until we can earn the ability to have
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.000]  more than one fork without leaving a mess.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.280]  A lot of it is just stuff that like seems intuitive.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.720]  That's not the stuff that in your life where you need to be kind of shaken out of, I mean
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.700]  stuff even from the last few years, call somebody what they want to be called and don't be a
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]  dick about it.
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.280]  I could elaborate more on that.
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:09.600]  You know, some of these get a little bit woolly, but they're mostly a sentence or two.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:14.120]  I have you, you've never written a book, right?
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:15.120]  Never finished a book.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.120]  Me neither.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.820]  But to me, I don't know that everybody who's good at writing and good at sharing thoughts
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.240]  and advice is meant to write.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:26.480]  No, that was, it was a, it was a brutal thing for me to realize I had bitten off, as you
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.200]  might say, more than I can chew.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.760]  I can't even go into all the reasons why.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.200]  I think this is your finest.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.320]  I appreciate you saying that.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.480]  Well, I was gonna say was that with the 43 folders days, what I realized too late when
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:42.640]  I was already into doing this book project was that I have a certain sweet spot for certain
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.640]  amounts of words.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.920]  Like I think I've done a pretty, I've done pretty good in the past with 140 and occasionally
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.640]  280 characters, but that's why Twitter was fun.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.640]  There's guard rails.
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:52.920]  It's 140 characters.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.020]  That's it.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:58.960]  And then, but then like honestly, what I discovered was that I, the stuff that I'm most happy
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:05.440]  about having written and that I like sharing with people, I don't know, 3000 to 5000 words.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:09.440]  I don't have a brain that works in 12,000 word increments.
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:14.960]  And that's what puts me into that spin or like why I need something like mark down to
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:15.960]  keep me focused.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.560]  Cause then I'll be doing all, I should make this an outline.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:21.340]  I should make this a mind map and all these different things that are taking me further
[01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.800]  and further away from just typing words.
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:28.400]  I, I mean like I thank you for saying that because I really appreciate it.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.760]  Like any true, truly like any great work of art, if they're best just enjoyed for what
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:35.760]  it is.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.640]  So what I, what I, what I, rather than talk and talk about it and read my favorite ones
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.140]  or whatever, I just wanted to encourage everybody listening to just go read it, but you know,
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.140]  be ready.
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.960]  It's a, I think I just tried to pretend print a PDF there and it's about 30 pages total.
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.600]  It's like a book lit.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.480]  It'll be, it'll, what I eventually want to get to someday is to make it where you could
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.040]  say, show me all the stuff about this kind of thing.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.040]  That kind of thing.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.160]  Print me a Moby or an EPUB someday.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.220]  But honestly it's all right there if anybody wants it.
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:10.440]  People have already written stuff, mostly against the gist, but like it's all pretty
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  well formed.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.440]  It's just marked down.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.100]  So if you wanted to make, see people have made like a fortune, sort of the equivalent
[01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.980]  of fortune on Unix with it and which is great.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:24.020]  And it's, it's, I think I put a pretty generous creative commons on it so people can use it
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.800]  as long as they're doing it for money stuff.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]  Yeah.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  But to me it's, I don't want to get into talking about EPUB readers and the Kindle and the
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.800]  books app and everything.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.520]  You don't want to talk about the wonderful Python app caliber.
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.640]  But you know what I like to do as I like to just sit back with something and an iPad and
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.840]  just sit there and scroll and have it be the nice, a nice readable size font.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:48.140]  Well have me on someday to really talk about this because like I grew up, I cut my teeth
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.240]  on reference books.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:54.920]  I loved things like obviously encyclopedias, but I also love things like the book of lists
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:59.080]  and the book rules of thumb and all these different things where there's just so many
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:04.640]  like little tidbits, little heuristics for like trying to make it through the day.
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.240]  And anyway, I appreciate you saying that.
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:09.240]  Have me back on another time and maybe it'll be more, there'll be more stuff there, but
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:13.280]  it'll still be in markdown because I, that's, that is the way and I love you for making
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  it.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.280]  Our first email was marked down.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.280]  You remember that?
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.080]  You said, Hey, if you want that, if you like that so much, if you're so gay for that, why
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.160]  don't you go use, go use Dean's one, humane text, the way he does it.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.200]  If you love it so much, why don't you gay marry it?

[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:41.560]  That's your fine podcast with, uh, I usually do there about this and uh, but you know what's,
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:47.280]  I would say, go check out reconcilable differences with my, my very, very worst, dear friend
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  John Siracusa.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.880]  We do show called reconcilable differences and it's a relay.fm slash RD.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.560]  And I think we've, I think it's a good show.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:58.440]  I mean, if you like that kind of thing and the upcoming episode is a lot of fun.

[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.800]  What John likes to say, I think is that ATP, accidental tech podcast, this is tech show
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.120]  and this is his show about feelings and they're in there and it's a joy to do.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.620]  I, he's my worst friend, but I love him very much and I think our, I suspect it's fun to
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:17.660]  watch our relationship be broken in kind of a sweet way.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.660]  It's it is.
