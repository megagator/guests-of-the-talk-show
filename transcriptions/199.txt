[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  I have not been more excited for an Apple event
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.340]  in recent memory than next week's.
[00:07.340 --> 00:10.540]  I don't know about you, but I am excited
[00:10.540 --> 00:14.200]  because I feel like there's a lot we don't know.
[00:14.200 --> 00:18.800]  Yeah, I think so, and it's kind of funny
[00:18.800 --> 00:21.320]  because I think part of the excitement
[00:21.320 --> 00:23.280]  comes from where it's gonna be,
[00:23.280 --> 00:25.240]  and part of the excitement comes from
[00:25.240 --> 00:29.040]  what's gonna be announced,
[00:29.040 --> 00:31.040]  and what we don't know about what's gonna be announced.
[00:31.040 --> 00:35.420]  I mean, we have a lot of, well, I won't say details.
[00:35.420 --> 00:40.400]  We have a lot of speculation and rumor on the new iPhone,
[00:40.400 --> 00:44.600]  but there's a lot of questions to be answered.
[00:44.600 --> 00:47.640]  It's not a complete black box,
[00:47.640 --> 00:51.480]  but I would venture to say it is as close
[00:51.480 --> 00:54.800]  to as little as we could know as possible.
[00:54.800 --> 00:57.160]  Like, just given the nature of what leaks
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.800]  out of the Asian supply chain
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.960]  and is outside Apple's control,
[01:02.300 --> 01:05.740]  it would be very, I mean, the only thing I can think of,
[01:05.740 --> 01:08.160]  there's a few things we gleaned
[01:08.160 --> 01:12.140]  from that botched release of the HomePod OS, right?
[01:12.140 --> 01:14.720]  And that when they, a month or so ago,
[01:14.720 --> 01:18.760]  when they publicly released that version of iOS,
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.760]  and then the Stephen Troughton Smith and his cohorts
[01:23.760 --> 01:25.640]  went through and found a bunch of resources.
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.600]  So there's a few things that were gleaned from that
[01:27.600 --> 01:30.280]  that were within Apple's control,
[01:30.280 --> 01:32.480]  but otherwise, we don't know much.
[01:32.480 --> 01:33.320]  I really don't.
[01:33.320 --> 01:35.120]  And like you said, even the venue is sort of a mystery.
[01:35.120 --> 01:35.980]  I mean, what's it like?
[01:35.980 --> 01:37.320]  I mean, there's blueprints.
[01:38.640 --> 01:39.860]  There were blueprints published
[01:39.860 --> 01:41.120]  of what the theater looked like,
[01:41.120 --> 01:42.760]  but I mean, that doesn't really,
[01:42.760 --> 01:45.760]  and some leaked photos during construction, but.
[01:45.760 --> 01:46.800]  Right.
[01:46.800 --> 01:47.640]  I don't know.
[01:47.640 --> 01:48.560]  It's the first event ever held there.
[01:48.560 --> 01:50.420]  It's kind of cool.
[01:50.420 --> 01:52.480]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:52.480 --> 01:55.680]  You know, even that part of it, to get to,
[01:55.680 --> 02:00.120]  I mean, I assume we'll be walking past the ring
[02:02.480 --> 02:03.320]  to get to.
[02:03.320 --> 02:05.160]  That's the funny part is that it's,
[02:05.160 --> 02:07.680]  I don't even know where we're gonna park, right?
[02:07.680 --> 02:09.080]  I know, I know.
[02:09.080 --> 02:10.640]  I have no idea.
[02:10.640 --> 02:11.920]  I don't know about you, but I didn't even,
[02:11.920 --> 02:14.040]  I mean, I got email with the invitation
[02:14.040 --> 02:17.840]  and I've gotten a few emails setting up times
[02:17.840 --> 02:20.440]  for post-event briefings,
[02:20.440 --> 02:24.360]  but even there, it was like,
[02:24.360 --> 02:27.400]  we'll give you more information on the details
[02:27.400 --> 02:29.480]  of how to get there later.
[02:29.480 --> 02:30.320]  Yeah.
[02:30.320 --> 02:31.520]  And it's Friday.
[02:31.520 --> 02:32.680]  Yeah, it's like very Friday.
[02:32.680 --> 02:35.080]  I know, I know, I know.
[02:35.080 --> 02:37.600]  And I really am,
[02:37.600 --> 02:40.080]  I'm looking forward to that whole aspect of it.
[02:40.080 --> 02:40.920]  Yeah.
[02:40.920 --> 02:41.740]  It's gonna be great.
[02:41.740 --> 02:43.640]  Among the things that leaked, there was a,
[02:43.640 --> 02:44.960]  who was it?
[02:44.960 --> 02:46.000]  Like the journals had,
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.040]  Wall Street Journal's had a bunch of things recently,
[02:48.040 --> 02:50.360]  but I think it was the Wall Street Journal
[02:50.360 --> 02:51.240]  who like two weeks ago,
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.160]  it was before I did the last episode with Jason Snell,
[02:54.160 --> 02:57.000]  where they said that they,
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.640]  it was before the invitations went out
[02:58.640 --> 02:59.560]  and they had the date.
[02:59.560 --> 03:02.480]  They said, it's gonna be Tuesday the 12th.
[03:02.480 --> 03:04.400]  And they said, and they think that,
[03:04.400 --> 03:07.020]  or Apple plans to have it in the Steve Jobs Theater,
[03:07.020 --> 03:08.040]  but who knows?
[03:08.040 --> 03:12.560]  And it's like, two weeks before the event, they know, right?
[03:12.560 --> 03:13.920]  Oh yeah, they know.
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.280]  That made it so curious.
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.480]  But I always, immediately my mind works
[03:18.480 --> 03:21.100]  at that meta level of journalism.
[03:21.100 --> 03:23.040]  And I'm thinking like, who is this?
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.920]  And it was just attributed to sources familiar
[03:25.920 --> 03:27.600]  with the situation or something,
[03:27.600 --> 03:29.820]  you know, that one of those vague,
[03:30.920 --> 03:33.800]  standard anonymous attributions.
[03:33.800 --> 03:34.740]  But it's like,
[03:36.440 --> 03:39.000]  I don't know, it's just so interesting to me,
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.920]  like behind the scenes, who it was that leaked the date,
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.980]  if they didn't know the actual venue.
[03:43.980 --> 03:45.160]  Or did they leak the date?
[03:45.160 --> 03:47.000]  It was just somebody who knew the date and the venue,
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.080]  but said, you know, but you can't even use the fact
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.520]  that it's gonna be at the Steve Jobs Theater anonymously.
[03:54.520 --> 03:55.440]  I don't know.
[03:55.440 --> 03:57.360]  But it's just, you know, they knew.
[03:57.360 --> 03:59.120]  Of course they knew.
[03:59.120 --> 04:02.880]  Yeah, I mean, you know, as much as we talk
[04:02.880 --> 04:05.840]  and as much speculation as there is out there,
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.840]  there's probably literally a handful of people at Apple,
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.740]  Tim, Schiller, and a couple of others
[04:15.740 --> 04:17.040]  that know what's coming.
[04:17.040 --> 04:18.340]  Yeah.
[04:18.340 --> 04:21.020]  But the event rollout though,
[04:21.020 --> 04:22.980]  they definitely, you know, there's a big team behind that.
[04:22.980 --> 04:25.320]  Like, in the last few years where they had it
[04:25.320 --> 04:27.580]  at the Bill, not Bill James,
[04:27.580 --> 04:29.060]  Bill James is the baseball writer,
[04:29.060 --> 04:31.480]  Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.
[04:33.300 --> 04:34.880]  I think it was the last two years in a row
[04:34.880 --> 04:36.380]  the September event was held there.
[04:36.380 --> 04:39.040]  They effectively both times built their own building
[04:39.040 --> 04:39.880]  in the building.
[04:39.880 --> 04:44.060]  I mean, it was like, but it was almost stunning
[04:44.060 --> 04:45.500]  that it was a temporary structure.
[04:45.500 --> 04:49.880]  The seating, the two years ago when they had it all set up
[04:49.880 --> 04:51.700]  with the Apple TV stuff,
[04:51.700 --> 04:54.660]  with a bunch of, you know, like fake living rooms,
[04:54.660 --> 04:57.060]  all of it was a temporary structure.
[04:57.060 --> 05:00.020]  Like, that's not the sort of thing that you can do,
[05:00.020 --> 05:01.460]  you know, like, oh, well,
[05:01.460 --> 05:03.940]  the theater's not really fully constructed.
[05:03.940 --> 05:08.380]  Let's call the Bill Graham center on three days
[05:08.380 --> 05:11.220]  before the event and see if we can quick put up a building.
[05:11.220 --> 05:12.060]  You know what I mean?
[05:12.060 --> 05:14.640]  Like, the amount of prep that Apple puts into these events
[05:14.640 --> 05:16.380]  is just stunning.
[05:16.380 --> 05:19.960]  It's just one of those little things that's hard to convey.
[05:21.460 --> 05:23.020]  You know, I mention it on the podcast
[05:23.020 --> 05:24.360]  whenever we talk about these events
[05:24.360 --> 05:26.460]  and sometimes I write about it, you know,
[05:26.460 --> 05:29.280]  when I write my post event thoughts
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.960]  and, you know, first thoughts about the event or whatever.
[05:32.960 --> 05:36.520]  But I don't know if I do justice to just how much effort
[05:36.520 --> 05:40.820]  Apple puts into the pomp and circumstance.
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.300]  I don't know how else to describe it.
[05:42.300 --> 05:44.140]  You know what I mean?
[05:44.140 --> 05:48.640]  Well, for anybody that hasn't been there,
[05:49.480 --> 05:52.980]  I think what's important to know about these events
[05:52.980 --> 05:56.460]  is that Apple puts as much work into the event itself
[05:56.460 --> 05:57.780]  as it does with the products.
[05:57.780 --> 05:58.620]  Yes.
[05:58.620 --> 06:01.760]  I mean, you know, it really is stunning
[06:01.760 --> 06:04.120]  to walk into an Apple event
[06:04.120 --> 06:08.740]  and see every little detail is taken care of.
[06:08.740 --> 06:13.740]  And for you and I and others,
[06:13.780 --> 06:15.300]  but for you and I,
[06:15.300 --> 06:20.300]  when we're done with the event, the keynote is over,
[06:22.320 --> 06:26.020]  then we're in a nice, very,
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.820]  nice doesn't even describe it,
[06:27.820 --> 06:30.700]  beautiful hands-on area
[06:30.700 --> 06:34.820]  where we, you know, get some time with the products.
[06:34.820 --> 06:38.020]  And then we're whisked away to a waiting area
[06:38.020 --> 06:42.740]  where they have, you know, coffee and muffins or whatever,
[06:42.740 --> 06:47.740]  and then into a briefing with Apple execs.
[06:47.920 --> 06:51.580]  And it's just every part of that
[06:51.580 --> 06:53.220]  just goes off so flawlessly.
[06:53.220 --> 06:54.180]  And I don't know about you,
[06:54.180 --> 06:56.900]  but I've been to other events where,
[06:56.900 --> 07:01.020]  whether it's a trade show or, you know, an event like this
[07:01.020 --> 07:02.340]  for another company,
[07:02.340 --> 07:05.420]  where it's just mind-blowing how bad it is.
[07:05.420 --> 07:09.740]  Yeah, I haven't been to a lot for other companies,
[07:09.740 --> 07:14.740]  but I was at the, for the original Microsoft Surface,
[07:14.900 --> 07:17.300]  the first batch,
[07:17.300 --> 07:22.300]  which was when they had the dual strategy of a Windows RT,
[07:22.300 --> 07:26.660]  Windows RT, which was all the new touch-based Metro
[07:26.660 --> 07:29.220]  interface running on an ARM tablet.
[07:29.220 --> 07:31.780]  And then they had the thicker, heavier tablet
[07:31.780 --> 07:34.580]  that ran the full version of Windows
[07:34.580 --> 07:37.820]  with the Metro interface, it was weird.
[07:38.900 --> 07:39.860]  And that was in New York.
[07:39.860 --> 07:41.500]  And it was not bad.
[07:41.500 --> 07:43.680]  It definitely wasn't bad, but it,
[07:43.680 --> 07:46.100]  and they definitely spent a lot of money on it,
[07:46.100 --> 07:50.100]  but it was nowhere near as polished.
[07:50.100 --> 07:54.460]  And the flow from one segment to another,
[07:54.460 --> 07:57.060]  like from before the event to the event,
[07:57.060 --> 08:00.940]  to where do you go after the event was totally haphazard.
[08:00.940 --> 08:03.260]  You know, it was sort of like every man for himself
[08:03.260 --> 08:04.860]  in those periods.
[08:04.860 --> 08:07.860]  Well, you can spend a lot of money on things
[08:07.860 --> 08:09.060]  and still not get it right.
[08:09.060 --> 08:12.260]  It's the attention to detail
[08:12.260 --> 08:14.260]  that Apple always seems to get right.
[08:14.260 --> 08:17.660]  And it's not just about the event,
[08:17.660 --> 08:22.380]  but the, like you said, the flow and then the products.
[08:22.380 --> 08:25.260]  I mean, that's, but you know, that's good and bad for Apple,
[08:25.260 --> 08:26.660]  especially when it comes to product,
[08:26.660 --> 08:28.860]  because now that's what we expect.
[08:28.860 --> 08:33.580]  And when something isn't right, then we say,
[08:33.580 --> 08:36.540]  okay, well, you know, for any other company,
[08:36.540 --> 08:38.260]  that's probably good enough.
[08:38.260 --> 08:41.180]  I think my favorite example of Apple going over the top
[08:41.180 --> 08:43.220]  for the hands-on area was,
[08:43.220 --> 08:48.060]  I think Katie Cotton was still there.
[08:49.220 --> 08:51.100]  I'm pretty sure.
[08:51.100 --> 08:52.820]  It might've been the last year
[08:52.820 --> 08:54.660]  that she was there running the event.
[08:54.660 --> 08:57.980]  And they had it, it was, I think it was an iPhone event.
[08:58.860 --> 09:02.860]  And they had it at the Yerba Buena Theater,
[09:02.860 --> 09:03.940]  which is a nice little theater,
[09:03.940 --> 09:06.820]  but it doesn't seat a lot of people, I don't think.
[09:06.820 --> 09:08.220]  No.
[09:08.220 --> 09:11.340]  And then there's a small hands-on area behind there,
[09:11.340 --> 09:14.380]  which is sort of in a room where,
[09:14.380 --> 09:16.820]  I don't even know what the normal purpose of that room is.
[09:16.820 --> 09:18.700]  It might just be like the lobby, you know,
[09:18.700 --> 09:20.300]  it's like the lobby where people, you know,
[09:20.300 --> 09:22.780]  if there's like, if you go to a play or an opera
[09:22.780 --> 09:25.220]  or something and there's a intermission,
[09:25.220 --> 09:27.420]  like where people can go and I don't know,
[09:27.420 --> 09:29.740]  get a drink or a snack or mingle or whatever,
[09:29.740 --> 09:32.260]  but it's pretty small and dark.
[09:32.260 --> 09:35.940]  And Apple literally had a construction crew come in
[09:35.940 --> 09:39.340]  and cut out the back wall to make it open air
[09:39.340 --> 09:40.860]  and get sunlight.
[09:40.860 --> 09:43.660]  And I remember talking to, I know it was Katie
[09:43.660 --> 09:46.660]  and Katie was still there and she was effectively
[09:46.660 --> 09:48.300]  in charge of, when she was running PR,
[09:48.300 --> 09:51.740]  she was one of her like, you know,
[09:51.740 --> 09:53.380]  not listed under her job title things,
[09:53.380 --> 09:56.340]  but she kind of oversaw events.
[09:57.340 --> 09:58.980]  And I just remember saying to her like,
[09:58.980 --> 10:00.100]  how much did that cost?
[10:00.100 --> 10:01.660]  And she goes, John, we're Apple.
[10:01.660 --> 10:05.860]  It was like, I was like, all right, I guess it's, you know,
[10:05.860 --> 10:06.900]  but it is just crazy.
[10:06.900 --> 10:08.540]  Like they literally cut a hole in the wall.
[10:08.540 --> 10:10.820]  And then like after the event had a construction crew
[10:10.820 --> 10:12.500]  come in and put the wall back up.
[10:14.500 --> 10:16.660]  And that's the level that they'll go to.
[10:16.660 --> 10:19.260]  Can you imagine like, if you ran your Bebuena
[10:19.260 --> 10:21.380]  and like Apple calls up and like,
[10:21.380 --> 10:22.500]  hey, we want to cut a hole in the wall.
[10:22.500 --> 10:23.420]  You'd be like, fuck you.
[10:23.420 --> 10:25.260]  And then it would be like, how much would that cost?
[10:25.260 --> 10:28.140]  And they're like, well, and then you throw a number,
[10:28.140 --> 10:31.820]  you throw a number out and Apple's like done.
[10:31.820 --> 10:33.260]  Yeah.
[10:33.260 --> 10:34.220]  Yeah.
[10:34.220 --> 10:35.620]  But that's what they do.
[10:35.620 --> 10:38.300]  You know, my favorite one, if you remember,
[10:38.300 --> 10:42.460]  I think it was probably maybe three years ago
[10:42.460 --> 10:44.100]  at De Anza College.
[10:45.500 --> 10:50.500]  They built an entire structure outside of De Anza.
[10:50.700 --> 10:54.020]  And it was the most beautiful structure you've ever seen.
[10:54.020 --> 10:56.820]  Now from the outside, it was pure white.
[10:56.820 --> 10:59.980]  That was the one where Apple Watch debuted, right?
[10:59.980 --> 11:01.660]  Yes, yes.
[11:01.660 --> 11:05.620]  But inside was absolutely stunning.
[11:05.620 --> 11:08.380]  I mean, I would have lived there.
[11:08.380 --> 11:09.220]  It was.
[11:09.220 --> 11:12.740]  It was, that was my favorite example
[11:12.740 --> 11:17.580]  of just how far Apple is willing to go.
[11:17.580 --> 11:22.580]  And, you know, after I've been going to Apple events
[11:23.660 --> 11:26.180]  since 1999.
[11:27.140 --> 11:31.740]  And, you know, we've been through a lot
[11:31.740 --> 11:34.460]  from Macworld events, which are, you know,
[11:34.460 --> 11:37.940]  they weren't as nice to Apple's own events
[11:37.940 --> 11:39.300]  and how they built them out.
[11:39.300 --> 11:44.260]  And now, you know, they're building buildings
[11:44.260 --> 11:47.180]  for one day, one day.
[11:47.180 --> 11:48.500]  So that's why I'm a little intrigued
[11:48.500 --> 11:49.660]  about the Steve Jobs Theater,
[11:49.660 --> 11:53.340]  because now they have, you know, a permanent theater.
[11:53.340 --> 11:57.340]  I mean, this is obviously going to be
[11:57.340 --> 12:01.420]  where probably every Apple event other than WWDC keynotes
[12:01.420 --> 12:04.340]  will take place for the rest of our careers.
[12:04.340 --> 12:05.180]  Really?
[12:05.180 --> 12:06.020]  I mean, so.
[12:06.020 --> 12:07.340]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:07.340 --> 12:08.300]  So I'm a little intrigued.
[12:08.300 --> 12:10.700]  Like if they put that much effort into the hands-on area
[12:10.700 --> 12:11.900]  for temporary structures,
[12:11.900 --> 12:15.020]  how much effort did they put into the hands-on area
[12:15.020 --> 12:16.020]  of the place where they're going to,
[12:16.020 --> 12:20.660]  they intend to have these events for 30 years?
[12:20.660 --> 12:22.420]  I'm like, I'm really kind of looking forward to that.
[12:22.420 --> 12:25.740]  Just architecturally, I'm really kind of intrigued
[12:25.740 --> 12:30.140]  to just geek out on the Steve Jobs Theater.
[12:30.140 --> 12:35.060]  Well, I would imagine that it's going to be
[12:35.060 --> 12:37.540]  like the old Roman amphitheaters
[12:37.540 --> 12:41.460]  where Tim probably doesn't even need a microphone,
[12:41.460 --> 12:43.140]  you know, where you can talk
[12:43.140 --> 12:46.180]  and it's just going to resonate throughout the whole theater.
[12:46.180 --> 12:48.980]  I don't know, a thousand people though.
[12:48.980 --> 12:53.980]  I bet the sound and the AV that's going to be in there
[12:56.980 --> 12:58.780]  is just going to be spectacular.
[12:58.780 --> 13:00.660]  Right, like what kind of screen are they going to put up there
[13:00.660 --> 13:01.500]  if it's a permanent,
[13:01.500 --> 13:05.060]  if they can spend the money and make it permanent?
[13:05.060 --> 13:06.180]  It's going to be great.
[13:07.140 --> 13:09.180]  Oh, it's going to be outstanding.
[13:09.180 --> 13:11.820]  But you know, it's funny.
[13:11.820 --> 13:14.260]  Do you think that all the pictures,
[13:14.260 --> 13:19.260]  now for the two hours leading up to the big unveil,
[13:20.980 --> 13:22.820]  the big unveil was going to be the campus
[13:22.820 --> 13:24.420]  because we're all going to be walking through there.
[13:24.420 --> 13:26.940]  We're all going to be taking pictures and posting them.
[13:26.940 --> 13:29.620]  Twitter is just going to be a mad house
[13:29.620 --> 13:32.860]  of everybody posting their pictures.
[13:32.860 --> 13:36.540]  So there's going to be two big unveils or three really
[13:36.540 --> 13:38.260]  because we're going to be walking past the ring.
[13:38.260 --> 13:40.700]  I don't know about you, but I've never been there.
[13:40.700 --> 13:44.180]  So we're going to be posting those pictures.
[13:44.180 --> 13:45.260]  Yeah, I've driven by.
[13:45.260 --> 13:47.060]  Just from like the highway, whatever highway it is
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.500]  that goes by.
[13:48.500 --> 13:49.780]  280, yeah.
[13:49.780 --> 13:51.300]  I tried to parachute him once,
[13:51.300 --> 13:56.220]  but Johnny was there with his sniper rifle.
[13:56.220 --> 14:00.180]  So a thousand seats is, I wonder,
[14:00.180 --> 14:02.540]  there's no, I don't think that there's possibly
[14:02.540 --> 14:04.460]  going to be a thousand members of the media.
[14:04.460 --> 14:07.060]  I mean, I think that there's going to be a lot of employees
[14:07.060 --> 14:09.340]  because that was sort of what they did at the Bill Graham,
[14:09.340 --> 14:10.260]  I mean, not even sort of.
[14:10.260 --> 14:13.780]  It's exactly what they did at the Bill Graham auditorium
[14:13.780 --> 14:18.780]  where the bottom section was media and invited guests.
[14:19.900 --> 14:20.740]  Right.
[14:20.740 --> 14:23.580]  And then the upper level was just Apple employees.
[14:23.580 --> 14:27.900]  So there were far more Apple employees than media and guests.
[14:27.900 --> 14:30.660]  Yeah, but look at this,
[14:30.660 --> 14:34.020]  look at the De Anza College one.
[14:34.020 --> 14:38.340]  I think that one had two or 2,000 or more.
[14:38.340 --> 14:39.860]  Yeah, maybe.
[14:39.860 --> 14:43.780]  And there were a ton of invited guests at that one.
[14:43.780 --> 14:44.620]  I remember that.
[14:44.620 --> 14:45.460]  A ton of them.
[14:45.460 --> 14:46.300]  Yeah.
[14:46.300 --> 14:47.140]  You remember, yeah, we were,
[14:47.140 --> 14:49.860]  I think you and I actually sat together during that one
[14:49.860 --> 14:54.300]  and there was just so many invited guests at that one.
[14:54.300 --> 14:56.700]  So I think that's probably what they'll do here.
[14:56.700 --> 14:58.900]  I don't envision a time when they'll ever
[15:00.100 --> 15:01.900]  not fill the theater for an event.
[15:01.900 --> 15:04.540]  Of course they're going to because they live stream
[15:04.540 --> 15:05.900]  and so you have to do that.
[15:05.900 --> 15:09.340]  Well, and it does, it creates a different vibe.
[15:09.340 --> 15:12.660]  Like, and I'll compare it directly to the ones
[15:12.660 --> 15:15.140]  that were held in town hall, where town hall.
[15:15.140 --> 15:16.340]  I love town hall.
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.900]  I mean, I think I counted the one time.
[15:18.900 --> 15:21.460]  I mean, there's, was it a, I don't know,
[15:21.460 --> 15:24.300]  like a hundred, 150 people tops.
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.940]  That sounds about right.
[15:25.940 --> 15:28.100]  Yeah, I think there's a couple hundred people
[15:28.100 --> 15:29.820]  that fit in town hall.
[15:29.820 --> 15:31.860]  Not, certainly no more than 200.
[15:31.860 --> 15:33.460]  That 200 would be jam packed.
[15:33.460 --> 15:37.860]  And so for those events, and you could tell
[15:37.860 --> 15:41.420]  because like, it became,
[15:41.420 --> 15:43.620]  we have a lot of friends in the same racket.
[15:43.620 --> 15:46.860]  And sometimes for the town hall ones,
[15:46.860 --> 15:48.980]  we knew people who didn't get invited,
[15:48.980 --> 15:51.500]  because it was, space was limited.
[15:52.820 --> 15:54.700]  And so I don't think they wasted any seats
[15:54.700 --> 15:59.020]  for Apple employees, other than the core Apple employees
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.900]  who were going to be there in the first few rows.
[16:01.900 --> 16:03.980]  And you get a different vibe in that place,
[16:03.980 --> 16:05.420]  not just because it's smaller,
[16:05.420 --> 16:08.100]  but because without the Apple employees,
[16:08.100 --> 16:09.620]  there's less applause.
[16:09.620 --> 16:19.700]  Like in the events where there's, like at the De Anza College one
[16:19.700 --> 16:22.900]  or at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium,
[16:22.900 --> 16:26.820]  the Apple employees at the proper points go nuts and applause.
[16:26.820 --> 16:29.900]  And the media, I mean, some people in the media clap,
[16:29.900 --> 16:33.380]  but they're just more reserved.
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.140]  I mean, if only because, I mean,
[16:35.140 --> 16:37.140]  partly because it's sort of a decorum of,
[16:37.140 --> 16:40.020]  hey, we're supposed to be observers here.
[16:40.020 --> 16:42.420]  We're not rooting for a sports team here,
[16:42.420 --> 16:43.740]  we're covering this.
[16:43.740 --> 16:46.500]  And part of it is because people are typing.
[16:46.500 --> 16:48.620]  Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true.
[16:48.620 --> 16:55.940]  I mean, you and I do our coverage pretty much the same.
[16:55.940 --> 16:59.860]  Now I stopped doing live coverage of the events
[16:59.860 --> 17:01.980]  because they stream it live.
[17:01.980 --> 17:04.100]  So there's really not much point.
[17:04.100 --> 17:06.900]  So I bring my Field Notes notebook
[17:06.900 --> 17:09.900]  and the pen and I cover it like that.
[17:09.900 --> 17:13.940]  And it's funny, Jason Snell said during,
[17:13.940 --> 17:16.300]  I think it was one of the events that he spoke at,
[17:16.300 --> 17:20.260]  that the first person he ever saw do a live update
[17:20.260 --> 17:25.020]  from an event was in like 2000, and it was me.
[17:25.020 --> 17:32.020]  From an Apple keynote, we were doing live events then.
[17:32.020 --> 17:34.540]  And now it just doesn't make any sense.
[17:34.540 --> 17:37.460]  I would rather jot down my notes to be able to write
[17:37.460 --> 17:38.700]  some thoughts a bit later.
[17:38.700 --> 17:39.860]  Yeah, the same way I am.
[17:39.860 --> 17:41.300]  I'm too slow of a thinker.
[17:41.300 --> 17:43.220]  I couldn't, and too slow of a typist.
[17:43.220 --> 17:46.460]  I've never really attempted to blog the whole thing live.
[17:46.460 --> 17:50.180]  I just can't, I really, I'm just, it's no joke.
[17:50.180 --> 17:51.420]  I just can't type that fast.
[17:51.420 --> 17:52.420]  And then what's the point?
[17:52.420 --> 17:55.340]  I mean, I'll fire off some tweets, but that's about it.
[17:55.340 --> 17:59.060]  I used to get Peter Cohen to do it
[17:59.060 --> 18:01.580]  because he was so much faster than I was.
[18:01.580 --> 18:03.940]  And Peter could like literally keep up
[18:03.940 --> 18:04.940]  with what they were saying.
[18:04.940 --> 18:07.260]  And I just, okay, you win.
[18:07.260 --> 18:09.820]  I remember back in the day, I remember when
[18:10.940 --> 18:14.540]  just getting networking was an issue
[18:14.540 --> 18:17.140]  and that some of the places, like the publications,
[18:17.140 --> 18:22.140]  like in Gadget or somebody with a crew of people,
[18:23.500 --> 18:25.620]  like somebody was responsible for bringing in
[18:25.620 --> 18:27.500]  the portable hotspot, like one of the,
[18:27.500 --> 18:29.380]  remember those things they used to be able to get for,
[18:29.380 --> 18:31.100]  you'd pay like 50 bucks a month and you'd get
[18:31.100 --> 18:35.740]  like a 3G wireless hotspot and it'd be hooked up
[18:35.740 --> 18:39.020]  to wires and power and it was like,
[18:39.020 --> 18:39.860]  you'd have to set up your own thing.
[18:39.860 --> 18:40.700]  It was a mess.
[18:40.700 --> 18:42.100]  And then remember the one when,
[18:42.100 --> 18:45.580]  this is one of my all time favorite keynote moments
[18:45.580 --> 18:48.420]  was when Steve Jobs interrupted the whole show
[18:48.420 --> 18:51.460]  because the wifi wasn't working, right?
[18:51.460 --> 18:52.300]  Remember?
[18:52.300 --> 18:53.140]  It was like a demo.
[18:53.140 --> 18:53.980]  Yeah, I remember.
[18:53.980 --> 18:56.940]  The demo went south and then like five minutes later,
[18:56.940 --> 18:58.900]  it was like, he had called somebody else up
[18:58.900 --> 19:00.900]  to do the next segment and he went backstage
[19:00.900 --> 19:02.940]  and obviously read somebody the riot act
[19:02.940 --> 19:04.620]  and said, what the fuck is going on?
[19:04.620 --> 19:07.540]  And they said, look, the problem is our wifi
[19:07.540 --> 19:09.300]  for the demo doesn't work because there's,
[19:09.300 --> 19:13.500]  I don't know, it was like 150 networks
[19:13.500 --> 19:15.740]  and Jobs comes out and goes totally off script
[19:15.740 --> 19:18.580]  and says, hey, listen, I just talked to my guys backstage
[19:18.580 --> 19:21.460]  and they say there's 200 wireless networks in here
[19:21.460 --> 19:22.740]  and it's fucking up our demo.
[19:22.740 --> 19:25.100]  So I'm gonna tell you right now, shut them all off.
[19:25.100 --> 19:26.180]  We'll wait.
[19:26.180 --> 19:29.900]  And he goes, if you see somebody next to you with one,
[19:29.900 --> 19:30.980]  make them shut it off.
[19:32.340 --> 19:34.980]  And it was so, it was so,
[19:34.980 --> 19:37.980]  it just was so exciting to be there because it's like,
[19:37.980 --> 19:38.820]  this is-
[19:38.820 --> 19:39.860]  Well, and he stood there.
[19:39.860 --> 19:40.700]  Yeah.
[19:40.700 --> 19:43.700]  He stood there and just, well, wait.
[19:43.700 --> 19:44.540]  Yeah.
[19:44.540 --> 19:46.380]  Oh my God, it was classic.
[19:46.380 --> 19:48.540]  Right, and he was just totally unafraid
[19:48.540 --> 19:52.460]  to go off the affable Steve,
[19:53.460 --> 19:55.020]  I'm so happy to be here
[19:55.020 --> 19:56.900]  and so glad to share this with you, Steve,
[19:56.900 --> 19:58.900]  and went to, I'm pissed off, Steve,
[19:58.900 --> 20:01.020]  and I'm gonna get what I want.
[20:01.020 --> 20:02.660]  Yeah, so fucking great.
[20:02.660 --> 20:05.900]  I will stand here and stare at you, 5,000 people.
[20:05.900 --> 20:09.340]  And I felt nervous, my palms got sweaty
[20:09.340 --> 20:10.980]  and I didn't have a network set up.
[20:10.980 --> 20:14.020]  I wasn't the part of the problem, right?
[20:14.020 --> 20:17.940]  I'm literally there with a paper notebook and a pen.
[20:18.940 --> 20:19.780]  And I felt bad.
[20:19.780 --> 20:22.940]  You feel like you should close up your notebook.
[20:22.940 --> 20:25.300]  Maybe I should just get up and leave.
[20:25.300 --> 20:26.140]  I should leave.
[20:26.140 --> 20:28.980]  I'm gonna leave.
[20:28.980 --> 20:29.820]  This is terrible.
[20:29.820 --> 20:31.660]  I feel terrible.
[20:31.660 --> 20:32.500]  You scared me, Steve.
[20:32.500 --> 20:33.340]  Yeah.
[20:33.340 --> 20:37.020]  I just, man, that was great.
[20:37.020 --> 20:37.860]  All right, let me just,
[20:37.860 --> 20:39.380]  before we get started on what we actually think
[20:39.380 --> 20:40.460]  we are going to see,
[20:40.460 --> 20:42.620]  let me interrupt the show here
[20:42.620 --> 20:45.820]  with a word from one of our good friends.
[20:45.820 --> 20:48.260]  It's our good friends at Warby Parker.
[20:48.260 --> 20:50.900]  Look, glasses should not cost as much as an iPhone.
[20:52.420 --> 20:53.620]  A lot of prescription glasses,
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.020]  you go out there and they really do,
[20:55.020 --> 20:56.500]  you know, five, $600.
[20:56.500 --> 20:57.380]  And then there's, you know,
[20:57.380 --> 20:59.980]  to get like the UV coating on the lenses
[20:59.980 --> 21:02.420]  or the anti-glare coating, it's another $100.
[21:02.420 --> 21:05.380]  Next thing you know, you're walking out $700.
[21:05.380 --> 21:08.820]  Warby Parker's glasses start at 95 bucks.
[21:08.820 --> 21:10.740]  And that includes the prescription lenses
[21:10.740 --> 21:13.940]  and there's no upsell on the coating or anything like that.
[21:13.940 --> 21:16.780]  No tricks, no gimmicks, really just 95 bucks
[21:16.780 --> 21:19.220]  and you get a good pair of prescription glasses.
[21:20.780 --> 21:21.740]  And you buy them online.
[21:21.740 --> 21:22.620]  You don't have to go to a store.
[21:22.620 --> 21:23.580]  You don't waste time.
[21:23.580 --> 21:24.420]  Now, how does that work?
[21:24.420 --> 21:28.180]  How do you buy something as personal as a pair of glasses?
[21:28.180 --> 21:30.100]  I mean, really, what's more personal than your glasses?
[21:30.100 --> 21:31.100]  They go right on your face.
[21:31.100 --> 21:32.980]  They really directly affect what you look like.
[21:32.980 --> 21:33.860]  Well, here's the deal.
[21:33.860 --> 21:35.220]  They have a try-on program.
[21:35.220 --> 21:38.180]  You go to the website, you pick up to five pairs
[21:38.180 --> 21:39.900]  that you think look good.
[21:39.900 --> 21:43.580]  They send them to you with dummy lenses in for free.
[21:43.580 --> 21:45.460]  And then you've got all five glasses at home.
[21:45.460 --> 21:46.900]  Try them on, look in the mirror,
[21:46.900 --> 21:49.940]  ask the people you live with which ones they like.
[21:49.940 --> 21:54.220]  And if you wanna buy one or more, you buy them.
[21:54.220 --> 21:56.260]  You don't wanna buy any of them, you don't buy any of them.
[21:56.260 --> 21:58.580]  But then you just put those five back in a box
[21:58.580 --> 22:00.900]  that they give you with the label on it already,
[22:00.900 --> 22:01.780]  send it right back to them.
[22:01.780 --> 22:03.580]  So you send the demos back to them
[22:03.580 --> 22:05.540]  and like a week or so later,
[22:05.540 --> 22:07.780]  you get the glasses that you ordered.
[22:07.780 --> 22:09.460]  And the demo thing, it's completely free.
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.500]  So if you get five glasses, try them on.
[22:11.500 --> 22:14.180]  You don't like any of them, you send them back.
[22:14.180 --> 22:16.100]  All you're out is the time it takes you
[22:16.100 --> 22:19.220]  to drop off the prepackaged pre-labeled thing
[22:19.220 --> 22:21.620]  with your UPS guy or whatever service they use.
[22:21.620 --> 22:22.860]  That's how easy it is.
[22:22.860 --> 22:25.540]  And their glasses are just great.
[22:25.540 --> 22:28.220]  I'm wearing a pair right now as I read this.
[22:28.220 --> 22:29.540]  I've had these for years,
[22:29.540 --> 22:32.060]  probably since they first started sponsoring the show.
[22:32.060 --> 22:33.940]  So as long ago, if you're a long time listener
[22:33.940 --> 22:36.060]  and you're like, man, Warby Parker's been sponsoring
[22:36.060 --> 22:37.300]  this show for a long time.
[22:37.300 --> 22:39.300]  I've got a pair that I ordered from them
[22:40.260 --> 22:41.940]  when they first started sponsoring,
[22:41.940 --> 22:42.940]  because that's what we do.
[22:42.940 --> 22:44.500]  It's like I got a Casper mattress up there.
[22:44.500 --> 22:45.780]  I mean, we try this stuff.
[22:47.220 --> 22:49.700]  My original pair of Warby Parkers are on right now.
[22:49.700 --> 22:53.020]  But that's how long they last, it's really great.
[22:53.020 --> 22:54.540]  They've got an app in the app store.
[22:54.540 --> 22:58.020]  You can use that to facilitate the picking the glasses
[22:58.020 --> 23:00.300]  and stuff like that instead of using the website.
[23:01.860 --> 23:02.700]  What else?
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.540]  And oh, here's the other thing.
[23:03.540 --> 23:05.620]  This is great, absolutely great,
[23:05.620 --> 23:08.660]  is every pair of glasses that they sell,
[23:08.660 --> 23:10.700]  Warby Parker distributes a pair of glasses
[23:10.700 --> 23:13.420]  to someone in need somewhere around the world.
[23:13.420 --> 23:14.260]  So that's fantastic.
[23:14.260 --> 23:15.820]  So you're not just buying yourself
[23:15.820 --> 23:17.500]  a great pair of eyeglasses.
[23:17.500 --> 23:21.500]  Warby Parker in your name will send a pair of glasses
[23:21.500 --> 23:22.380]  to somebody in need.
[23:22.380 --> 23:25.020]  Imagine how bad that would be if you had vision
[23:25.020 --> 23:26.820]  and needed corrected lenses and lived somewhere
[23:26.820 --> 23:28.660]  and you couldn't afford to get them.
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.660]  That'd be terrible.
[23:30.660 --> 23:31.940]  So they're helping to address that.
[23:31.940 --> 23:33.620]  So my thanks to Warby Parker.
[23:33.620 --> 23:36.420]  Go to warbyparker.com slash the talk show.
[23:36.420 --> 23:40.020]  They use the the in the code warbyparker.com
[23:40.020 --> 23:41.700]  slash the talk show.
[23:41.700 --> 23:44.900]  And that'll be great.
[23:44.900 --> 23:46.260]  My thanks to Warby Parker.
[23:46.260 --> 23:51.260]  You know what, they have a storefront in Palo Alto.
[23:53.820 --> 23:54.660]  I was gonna go in there
[23:54.660 --> 23:56.900]  because I need a new pair of glasses.
[23:56.900 --> 24:00.460]  I don't know why, but I get through glasses like crazy.
[24:00.460 --> 24:03.820]  My rims always mess up.
[24:03.820 --> 24:06.860]  So I don't sit on them or anything.
[24:06.860 --> 24:10.700]  We have a boutique here in Center City, Philadelphia
[24:10.700 --> 24:13.860]  as well, just not that easy walking distance for me.
[24:13.860 --> 24:16.740]  And I've actually gone there to get a pair of glasses.
[24:17.940 --> 24:21.220]  So if you check their site, maybe you live near one too.
[24:21.220 --> 24:24.500]  It's funny though, when you buy them from the retail store,
[24:24.500 --> 24:27.660]  it's literally, they just have salespeople.
[24:27.660 --> 24:28.820]  They just go to the website
[24:28.820 --> 24:32.060]  and it's literally the same ordering process.
[24:32.060 --> 24:33.820]  It still goes through the website
[24:33.820 --> 24:35.900]  and they ship them right to your house.
[24:35.900 --> 24:36.860]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[24:36.860 --> 24:39.660]  Yeah, it's just an easier way.
[24:39.660 --> 24:42.020]  The retail, the whole retail angle on it
[24:42.020 --> 24:43.980]  is just so that you can try on as many glasses
[24:43.980 --> 24:46.460]  as you like right there in person.
[24:46.460 --> 24:47.380]  How about that?
[24:47.380 --> 24:48.220]  Pretty neat.
[24:50.580 --> 24:51.940]  All right, let's talk about next week's event.
[24:51.940 --> 24:52.780]  What do we expect?
[24:52.780 --> 24:53.940]  So what do we know?
[24:53.940 --> 24:57.340]  We know, well, or we think we know
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.060]  that there's gonna be three new iPhones
[24:59.060 --> 25:04.060]  and updated 4.7, I don't think they're gonna call it the 7S,
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.100]  but something equivalent to what you would think
[25:07.100 --> 25:10.060]  the iPhone 7S is, something a 5.5 inch,
[25:10.060 --> 25:12.460]  which would be equivalent to the 7S Plus,
[25:13.700 --> 25:15.060]  using the same type of screen,
[25:15.060 --> 25:17.580]  same size screens as the 7 and 7 Plus today.
[25:17.580 --> 25:21.980]  And a new iPhone at a higher price point
[25:21.980 --> 25:26.980]  and whatever, code name D22 with the OLED screen
[25:27.180 --> 25:29.580]  that goes edge to edge and has a notch at the top
[25:29.580 --> 25:31.740]  for the camera sensors and stuff like that.
[25:33.740 --> 25:35.060]  We know that.
[25:35.060 --> 25:37.780]  We don't know what they're gonna call any of these phones.
[25:37.780 --> 25:38.620]  Right?
[25:38.620 --> 25:41.900]  So we don't know what they're gonna cost.
[25:41.900 --> 25:44.180]  We don't know when they're gonna ship.
[25:46.980 --> 25:51.340]  Like I said, there's a lot to be worked out still.
[25:51.340 --> 25:53.940]  So just sticking to iPhone,
[25:53.940 --> 25:56.540]  and I think we can get to Apple TV and Apple Watch
[25:56.540 --> 25:58.820]  and HomePod and other things that might come up
[25:58.820 --> 26:02.220]  in this event later, but just sticking to iPhone,
[26:02.220 --> 26:03.740]  man, we don't know a lot.
[26:03.740 --> 26:06.740]  And so everybody's focused on the OLED screen
[26:06.740 --> 26:09.380]  and the new high-end one, and that certainly
[26:09.380 --> 26:11.900]  is going to be different and interesting.
[26:13.700 --> 26:16.500]  But nothing else about that device has leaked,
[26:16.500 --> 26:19.300]  to my knowledge, really, other than this story
[26:19.300 --> 26:23.500]  that it supposedly doesn't have touch ID,
[26:23.500 --> 26:25.220]  either through deliberate design choice
[26:25.220 --> 26:27.580]  or because they couldn't figure out how to,
[26:27.580 --> 26:29.140]  and there's a Wall Street Journal story
[26:29.140 --> 26:32.140]  from like two days ago that I will put in the show notes
[26:32.140 --> 26:34.820]  that suggests, according to their sources,
[26:34.820 --> 26:37.660]  that Apple tried and, at some point this summer,
[26:37.660 --> 26:40.380]  gave up on getting a touch ID sensor integrated
[26:40.380 --> 26:42.580]  into the screen, and so it doesn't have it.
[26:43.860 --> 26:45.180]  But we don't know anything about the camera.
[26:45.180 --> 26:47.060]  We don't know if it's gonna be, is it gonna be like,
[26:47.060 --> 26:51.100]  using faster chips than the 7S and 7S Plus,
[26:51.100 --> 26:53.180]  which I'll just use those names.
[26:53.180 --> 26:54.620]  I really don't think they're gonna call it that,
[26:54.620 --> 26:55.860]  but just as a shorthand.
[26:58.740 --> 27:02.060]  Well, the big thing, I think, coming for this one,
[27:02.060 --> 27:06.860]  besides the obvious design change and edge-to-edge screen,
[27:06.860 --> 27:10.580]  will be the biometrics, the face recognition.
[27:10.580 --> 27:12.580]  That's gonna be the big thing for me.
[27:12.580 --> 27:15.180]  And we've talked about all of this before,
[27:15.180 --> 27:18.780]  about whether it will work in all circumstances,
[27:18.780 --> 27:23.780]  like touch ID does, because I've become so used
[27:24.020 --> 27:27.140]  to using touch ID for payments,
[27:27.140 --> 27:31.260]  for just looking at my phone,
[27:31.260 --> 27:33.620]  and you just kinda put your thumb on it,
[27:33.620 --> 27:36.100]  and it unlocks, and everything is so quick,
[27:36.100 --> 27:40.780]  and that's what we expect from this facial recognition, too.
[27:40.780 --> 27:45.420]  But you have to think that if Apple is releasing it,
[27:45.420 --> 27:46.860]  it works really well.
[27:46.860 --> 27:51.740]  But we're gonna try it in so many different situations.
[27:51.740 --> 27:53.460]  I mean, I love going to concerts,
[27:53.460 --> 27:56.460]  and when I go to concerts, I love to take pictures.
[27:56.460 --> 27:59.620]  So if I pull out my phone and there's flashing lights
[27:59.620 --> 28:02.100]  and everything at a concert, because let's face it,
[28:02.100 --> 28:04.740]  I'm not at a jazz concert most of the time.
[28:04.740 --> 28:06.060]  I'm at a metal show.
[28:06.060 --> 28:08.140]  So there's lights going and everything else,
[28:08.140 --> 28:13.020]  and it has to recognize me and unlock in split seconds
[28:13.020 --> 28:15.820]  the same way that my finger would.
[28:15.820 --> 28:18.100]  If it tells me that I have to use my code,
[28:18.100 --> 28:20.660]  well, that's a huge step backward.
[28:23.140 --> 28:26.020]  This is, to me, part of the excitement of the event
[28:26.020 --> 28:31.020]  is how good is, if it's true that it doesn't have touch ID,
[28:33.060 --> 28:35.700]  or I guess, even if these reports are wrong
[28:35.700 --> 28:38.660]  and they do have touch ID, but it's in the screen
[28:38.660 --> 28:41.380]  and therefore a different type of sensor,
[28:41.380 --> 28:45.160]  does it work as well as the existing touch ID sensors?
[28:46.020 --> 28:47.460]  But if it doesn't have touch ID,
[28:47.460 --> 28:51.200]  how does this facial ID thing work?
[28:51.200 --> 28:52.040]  We don't even know.
[28:52.040 --> 28:52.880]  I mean, honestly, we don't.
[28:52.880 --> 28:56.300]  I mean, one thing that I think is almost certain,
[28:56.300 --> 28:57.860]  and it seems backed up by reports
[28:57.860 --> 29:01.100]  about the sensors and stuff, that it's not a camera.
[29:01.100 --> 29:02.740]  And this is the thing for people.
[29:02.740 --> 29:04.340]  There's a lot of people who, when they see these stories,
[29:04.340 --> 29:05.820]  like either tweet at me or email me,
[29:05.820 --> 29:08.900]  and they're like, they think Apple's jumped the shark.
[29:08.900 --> 29:10.060]  This is gonna be a disaster.
[29:10.060 --> 29:12.180]  They don't wanna be taking a selfie
[29:12.180 --> 29:14.220]  every time they unlock the phone.
[29:14.220 --> 29:15.580]  There's no way that it works like that,
[29:15.580 --> 29:17.960]  and there's no way that it would require the light.
[29:17.960 --> 29:19.500]  I mean, it has to work, for example,
[29:19.500 --> 29:21.280]  when you wake up in the middle of the night
[29:21.280 --> 29:23.300]  or in the morning when it's still dark, right?
[29:23.300 --> 29:27.100]  You can't have a phone that you have to use
[29:27.100 --> 29:30.260]  a six-digit passcode just because you're in the dark.
[29:30.260 --> 29:31.100]  That's ridiculous.
[29:31.100 --> 29:32.540]  I mean, that would be absurd.
[29:32.540 --> 29:34.860]  But how reliable is it?
[29:34.860 --> 29:37.380]  Is it like, does it only work nine times out of 10?
[29:37.380 --> 29:39.340]  Because nine times out of 10 sounds good,
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.740]  and if it was like a science project or a student project,
[29:41.740 --> 29:43.860]  you'd be like, wow, a facial recognition system
[29:43.860 --> 29:45.780]  that works nine times out of 10, that's great.
[29:45.780 --> 29:50.780]  But touch ID works 999 times out of 1,000.
[29:50.780 --> 29:55.780]  I mean, it's really rare when touch ID doesn't work.
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.700]  And it's almost, for me, it's almost,
[29:57.700 --> 30:01.100]  I mean, I know that there are people who,
[30:01.100 --> 30:03.340]  for whatever reason, their skin is different
[30:03.340 --> 30:05.220]  or their fingerprints are, I don't know,
[30:05.220 --> 30:06.660]  too thin or something.
[30:06.660 --> 30:07.660]  I know that there are some people
[30:07.660 --> 30:08.940]  who touch ID doesn't work great for,
[30:08.940 --> 30:11.020]  but for me, it always works.
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.340]  And the only times it doesn't is if,
[30:13.340 --> 30:15.860]  and I know exactly why, my hands are soaking wet.
[30:15.860 --> 30:19.020]  If my hands are, it's raining and my hands are soaking wet,
[30:19.020 --> 30:19.840]  it doesn't work.
[30:19.840 --> 30:21.940]  I know, I just dry my thumb and then it'll work.
[30:21.940 --> 30:23.220]  And then it does.
[30:23.220 --> 30:27.000]  Like the facial, if they replace touch ID with a facial ID,
[30:27.000 --> 30:29.980]  it has to be as reliable or better in every way,
[30:29.980 --> 30:34.420]  as fast, as secure, as trustworthy, as reliable.
[30:34.420 --> 30:36.660]  And nine times out of 10 isn't good enough.
[30:36.660 --> 30:39.220]  If one time out of 10, when you try to unlock your phone,
[30:39.220 --> 30:41.500]  it doesn't unlock, that sucks.
[30:41.500 --> 30:44.340]  It'll make you furious, because we're used to,
[30:44.340 --> 30:47.900]  we're already used to it working as well as touch ID.
[30:47.900 --> 30:52.700]  And this is what makes these type of events
[30:52.700 --> 30:57.340]  so difficult for Apple, because they know all this.
[30:57.340 --> 31:02.340]  They know that if this new facial recognition screws up
[31:03.300 --> 31:05.540]  and they don't have touch ID in there,
[31:06.460 --> 31:09.240]  then they're gonna get hammered and they will.
[31:09.240 --> 31:11.640]  I mean, there's already people
[31:11.640 --> 31:16.040]  that are just waiting to write that story that it failed.
[31:16.040 --> 31:19.820]  The same way that they did when touch ID came out.
[31:19.820 --> 31:22.300]  Oh, well, you can cut off somebody's thumb
[31:22.300 --> 31:26.660]  and have their fingerprint.
[31:26.660 --> 31:28.600]  So you know that stuff is coming,
[31:28.600 --> 31:32.660]  but I'm pretty confident that it's gonna work.
[31:32.660 --> 31:34.120]  I'm hopeful and confident.
[31:34.120 --> 31:38.340]  I saw a video just like the Samsung Galaxy Note 8
[31:38.340 --> 31:41.140]  just shipped, not the Galaxy S8,
[31:41.140 --> 31:43.660]  which shipped six months ago, but the Note 8 shipped
[31:43.660 --> 31:46.620]  and it has a facial ID for unlocking.
[31:46.620 --> 31:47.460]  But it does seem to be-
[31:47.460 --> 31:48.300]  Was it on fire?
[31:48.300 --> 31:49.980]  No, but it is camera-based.
[31:49.980 --> 31:51.020]  And so I saw a demo,
[31:51.020 --> 31:54.060]  like somebody was in the hands-on area from the event,
[31:54.060 --> 31:58.860]  took a selfie on their phone and showed the selfie
[31:58.860 --> 32:01.700]  to the S8 after having set up the facial ID
[32:01.700 --> 32:02.700]  and it unlocked.
[32:04.340 --> 32:06.800]  So it was just pointing at the picture of himself
[32:06.800 --> 32:07.640]  on the other phone.
[32:07.640 --> 32:09.560]  And Samsung does make it clear,
[32:09.560 --> 32:10.980]  from what I've been able to tell,
[32:10.980 --> 32:13.500]  that when they unlock with the facial ID,
[32:13.500 --> 32:15.860]  it's, they tell you it's not as secure
[32:15.860 --> 32:18.860]  and you can't use it for things like payments.
[32:18.860 --> 32:21.100]  You know, like it will unlock your phone
[32:21.100 --> 32:23.920]  and then you can go and launch apps and stuff like that,
[32:23.920 --> 32:26.900]  but it won't let you do things that require
[32:26.900 --> 32:31.060]  the equivalent of a administrator ID.
[32:31.060 --> 32:32.900]  You know how like sometimes you have to,
[32:32.900 --> 32:35.340]  even the iPhone will make you put your passcode in,
[32:35.340 --> 32:38.180]  like to install a software update or something like that.
[32:39.180 --> 32:43.100]  Or like when you upgrade to the, switch to the betas,
[32:43.100 --> 32:45.900]  when you install the, there's like a,
[32:45.900 --> 32:47.500]  the way they do the iOS betas now,
[32:47.500 --> 32:52.500]  is you install a certificate and then that,
[32:52.500 --> 32:54.180]  you know, puts your iPhone on, you know,
[32:54.180 --> 32:56.700]  looking for the software updates from the beta server
[32:56.700 --> 32:58.360]  instead of the release server.
[32:59.960 --> 33:02.900]  You know, stuff like that, they don't let it do it.
[33:02.900 --> 33:04.780]  But still, if Apple's works like that,
[33:04.780 --> 33:06.500]  that's embarrassing, really.
[33:06.500 --> 33:08.580]  And I think they're gonna get called out on it.
[33:08.580 --> 33:10.340]  And I think the reason it seems a little exciting,
[33:10.340 --> 33:11.800]  and there's a part of me that wants to say,
[33:11.800 --> 33:14.700]  Apple wouldn't do this unless they knew
[33:14.700 --> 33:16.900]  that the facial ID was gonna be good enough.
[33:18.740 --> 33:21.500]  But there's a part of me that wants to argue the counter way
[33:21.500 --> 33:23.740]  that I can see how they could back themselves
[33:23.740 --> 33:27.100]  into a corner where maybe they had to,
[33:27.100 --> 33:30.100]  or at least they felt like they had to ship it
[33:30.100 --> 33:34.860]  even with a not quite as good as Touch ID facial ID sensor.
[33:34.860 --> 33:37.220]  Meaning like, they really thought they were gonna pull it
[33:37.220 --> 33:39.560]  off and get Touch ID under the screen.
[33:39.560 --> 33:44.460]  And it got really late in the game, like early this summer.
[33:44.460 --> 33:47.500]  And they concluded they couldn't, and they had to pull it.
[33:47.500 --> 33:50.380]  But they also felt like we can't go another year
[33:50.380 --> 33:54.180]  without an edge-to-edge OLED screen.
[33:54.180 --> 33:57.740]  You know, our phones look dated compared
[33:57.740 --> 34:00.380]  to the highest end phones from Samsung and LG
[34:00.380 --> 34:01.980]  because everybody else has these screens
[34:01.980 --> 34:05.380]  with no forehead, no chin, or minimal forehead and chin.
[34:05.380 --> 34:10.380]  And so we need to forge ahead, Touch ID be damned.
[34:10.460 --> 34:13.440]  I could see how they maybe felt like they got backed
[34:13.440 --> 34:16.180]  into a corner, and I could see how when they made
[34:16.180 --> 34:20.620]  that decision at the Monday morning executive meeting,
[34:20.620 --> 34:23.460]  that there were probably people, if that's the case,
[34:23.460 --> 34:24.980]  I could hypothetically see how that was
[34:24.980 --> 34:26.780]  a contentious argument, and there'd be people
[34:26.780 --> 34:29.180]  on both sides, one side arguing,
[34:29.180 --> 34:31.700]  we need to scrap this and wait another year,
[34:31.700 --> 34:33.780]  or release it six months later,
[34:33.780 --> 34:35.980]  do whatever it takes to get it good enough.
[34:37.380 --> 34:39.260]  And other side saying, we can't launch
[34:39.260 --> 34:40.620]  in September without this phone.
[34:40.620 --> 34:42.660]  So do you think that this was the same type
[34:42.660 --> 34:44.820]  of pressure they felt to build a bigger phone?
[34:44.820 --> 34:47.820]  I don't think it's quite as big a deal as that.
[34:47.820 --> 34:50.220]  Because I feel like the bigger phone,
[34:50.220 --> 34:52.120]  the bigger phones thing turned out
[34:52.120 --> 34:54.580]  to be a mass market phenomenon, right?
[34:54.580 --> 34:59.580]  Like just normal people, non-phone enthusiasts.
[34:59.900 --> 35:03.580]  And here's how I would describe a normal phone consumer.
[35:03.580 --> 35:07.260]  I just saw a poll the other day.
[35:07.260 --> 35:10.260]  I got an email from SurveyMonkey with a poll
[35:13.460 --> 35:14.740]  that they had conducted recently
[35:14.740 --> 35:17.100]  about people's phone expectations.
[35:17.100 --> 35:19.140]  How many, what percentage of 1,000 people
[35:19.140 --> 35:21.100]  are excited about the new iPhone?
[35:21.100 --> 35:23.340]  What percent think they're gonna buy it or whatever?
[35:23.340 --> 35:24.500]  And one of the questions they asked
[35:24.500 --> 35:26.420]  is how often do you replace your phone?
[35:26.420 --> 35:29.700]  And the most popular answer with like,
[35:29.700 --> 35:32.420]  and I don't know, there's some people said every year,
[35:32.420 --> 35:33.580]  some people said every two years,
[35:33.580 --> 35:34.780]  some people said three or more years.
[35:34.780 --> 35:37.020]  But the most popular answer was I replaced,
[35:37.020 --> 35:39.700]  I only replaced my phone when my old one breaks.
[35:39.700 --> 35:41.060]  It was like 38%.
[35:41.060 --> 35:43.020]  That's what I would call a normal person.
[35:43.020 --> 35:45.220]  That's how most people I know in my family,
[35:48.380 --> 35:51.260]  they end up replacing it every three, four, five years anyway
[35:51.260 --> 35:53.340]  because that's how long it takes for phones to break.
[35:53.340 --> 35:56.500]  But they just don't, if their phone works perfectly,
[35:56.500 --> 35:59.300]  they're not even thinking about getting a new phone.
[35:59.300 --> 36:01.180]  I mean, that's how I am with cars, for example.
[36:01.180 --> 36:06.020]  But when you and I look at, and I caught-
[36:06.020 --> 36:07.100]  Before we get off that,
[36:07.100 --> 36:08.460]  I think that there were normal people
[36:08.460 --> 36:12.220]  like that type of people who wanted big 5.5-inch phones.
[36:12.220 --> 36:15.220]  They just, that seems great to me.
[36:15.220 --> 36:17.820]  So I don't think that's true for this edge-to-edge trend.
[36:17.820 --> 36:20.940]  I think it's people like us who are really enthusiasts
[36:20.940 --> 36:24.780]  who really think about every single little design detail
[36:24.780 --> 36:27.620]  of the phones who are into the minimization
[36:27.620 --> 36:28.780]  of the chin and forehead.
[36:28.780 --> 36:31.500]  I caution people all the time and the people
[36:31.500 --> 36:36.380]  that are in the industry that you can't think
[36:36.380 --> 36:41.020]  about these types of things only the way that we do.
[36:41.020 --> 36:43.780]  You have to think about this the way that a consumer does.
[36:43.780 --> 36:48.780]  And a consumer, excuse me, doesn't care as much as,
[36:49.220 --> 36:52.420]  typically doesn't care as much as you and I may
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.740]  about an iPhone.
[36:53.740 --> 36:58.740]  The same way that if you and I were doing TV blogs,
[36:59.260 --> 37:04.260]  would we care as much about iPhones?
[37:04.620 --> 37:05.460]  Probably not.
[37:05.460 --> 37:07.580]  I could care less about TVs.
[37:07.580 --> 37:11.340]  If I need a new TV, I'm gonna go down to Best Buy
[37:11.340 --> 37:14.580]  or whatever it is, and I'm gonna buy a new TV.
[37:14.580 --> 37:17.300]  And I'm gonna buy whatever I can afford to get
[37:17.300 --> 37:20.100]  and the best one that I can get.
[37:20.100 --> 37:21.660]  And I'm gonna be happy with that.
[37:21.660 --> 37:24.460]  I'm in between.
[37:24.460 --> 37:29.460]  I haven't bought a new TV in maybe like 10 years.
[37:31.380 --> 37:33.020]  But I love my TV.
[37:33.020 --> 37:35.860]  It's a pioneer plasma, and I just love it to death.
[37:35.860 --> 37:38.980]  It's just one of my favorite things I've ever purchased
[37:38.980 --> 37:41.280]  in my life because I just love the picture quality.
[37:41.280 --> 37:43.620]  But I researched the hell out of it when I needed
[37:43.620 --> 37:45.180]  to get it 10 years ago.
[37:46.220 --> 37:48.580]  And I knew exactly, out of all the TVs in the market,
[37:48.580 --> 37:49.560]  I had narrowed it down.
[37:49.560 --> 37:53.860]  I know exactly, I want this model from Pioneer at this size.
[37:55.900 --> 37:57.380]  And it was like three times,
[37:57.380 --> 37:58.620]  at least three times more expensive
[37:58.620 --> 38:01.460]  than like just the typical whatever size.
[38:01.460 --> 38:02.820]  I think it's like 55 inches.
[38:04.180 --> 38:09.180]  But once I got it, and we're not like a big
[38:09.180 --> 38:11.020]  put a TV in every room family.
[38:11.020 --> 38:13.320]  Like I've never had a TV in my bedroom.
[38:13.320 --> 38:15.060]  I just, I don't watch TV in bed.
[38:15.980 --> 38:17.540]  So we just have one main TV.
[38:17.540 --> 38:20.500]  Jonas has a second TV that he has hooked up for video games.
[38:20.500 --> 38:25.460]  But I wanted to research the hell out of it
[38:25.460 --> 38:26.620]  and get a really good TV.
[38:26.620 --> 38:28.680]  And then I just tuned out of the entire,
[38:28.680 --> 38:30.380]  I haven't looked, I haven't shopped for a TV.
[38:30.380 --> 38:31.900]  I have no idea.
[38:31.900 --> 38:33.500]  I have no idea what's out there.
[38:35.460 --> 38:40.100]  I mean, things like TVs, refrigerators,
[38:40.100 --> 38:45.100]  all the, I don't go to refrigerator blogs and look for,
[38:50.940 --> 38:52.260]  what's coming out in a month.
[38:52.260 --> 38:53.940]  Should I wait a month to buy this fridge?
[38:53.940 --> 38:58.940]  Or should, it just, and I think for the majority
[38:59.540 --> 39:02.220]  of consumers, that's how they feel about an iPhone.
[39:02.220 --> 39:05.020]  That's why Apple will continue to sell iPhones
[39:05.900 --> 39:08.700]  up until the time the new ones come out.
[39:08.700 --> 39:11.860]  Because people, their phone breaks and they go.
[39:11.860 --> 39:12.820]  Let's play what if.
[39:12.820 --> 39:16.860]  What if early this summer, Apple had figured out,
[39:16.860 --> 39:19.460]  there's no way that we can integrate a touch ID
[39:19.460 --> 39:21.860]  onto the screen like we thought we could
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.560]  in time to launch it September.
[39:24.460 --> 39:28.340]  What if they had instead of what they've seemingly done,
[39:28.340 --> 39:30.940]  what if they had said, okay, so that phone,
[39:30.940 --> 39:34.020]  we're gonna have to punt and either push it back six months
[39:34.020 --> 39:36.140]  and do like a off cycle thing,
[39:36.140 --> 39:38.500]  like when they shipped the iPhone SE
[39:38.500 --> 39:42.300]  or punted a full year to next September.
[39:42.300 --> 39:45.420]  And this event comes Monday or Tuesday
[39:45.420 --> 39:49.220]  and everybody in the press is still thinking,
[39:49.220 --> 39:50.580]  I guess if they had done that,
[39:50.580 --> 39:51.940]  they would have, it would have leaked
[39:51.940 --> 39:53.940]  that Apple isn't shipping that phone, right?
[39:53.940 --> 39:56.260]  It's like they would have set the expectation.
[39:56.260 --> 39:58.600]  They wouldn't let everybody file into the room
[39:58.600 --> 40:01.100]  thinking there's gonna be an iPhone Pro
[40:01.100 --> 40:02.500]  and those other two phones.
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.500]  They'd somehow set that expectation before the event.
[40:05.500 --> 40:07.380]  But I think they'd have to, right?
[40:07.380 --> 40:09.580]  When that leaked, when the leak comes out,
[40:09.580 --> 40:13.140]  like a Wall Street Journal story in mid July comes out
[40:13.140 --> 40:16.160]  that says Apple, unlike the rumors that have been to date,
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.020]  they're actually only going to ship two new iPhones
[40:19.020 --> 40:21.940]  in September updates to the 4.7 inch
[40:21.940 --> 40:26.620]  and 5.5 inch LCD iPhones sevens.
[40:28.380 --> 40:31.100]  When that came out, they would have taken a huge hit,
[40:31.100 --> 40:34.160]  but it would have been a huge hit to me in,
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.120]  I think in our crowd, the tech enthusiast crowd
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.220]  would have excoriated them for this.
[40:41.220 --> 40:43.860]  It might've hurt the stock price because business,
[40:45.260 --> 40:46.620]  investor types are sort of,
[40:46.620 --> 40:48.120]  they don't really geek out in the details,
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.020]  but they certainly geek out on the idea
[40:50.020 --> 40:53.280]  of like a $1,200 iPhone that they think might sell well.
[40:54.940 --> 40:56.520]  But I don't think it would have really,
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.820]  I don't think it would have really registered
[41:00.460 --> 41:01.620]  among normal people.
[41:01.620 --> 41:04.580]  And I know that there's a lot of people who disagree.
[41:04.580 --> 41:05.660]  There's a lot of people who think
[41:05.660 --> 41:08.640]  that there's enough people out there who really are,
[41:12.480 --> 41:13.500]  I mean, it's the whole argument
[41:13.500 --> 41:15.860]  of how much does the iPhone 7 resembled
[41:15.860 --> 41:19.660]  the two year older than the iPhone 7, the 6, right?
[41:19.660 --> 41:22.660]  That the 6, the 6s and the 7 became three generations
[41:22.660 --> 41:25.260]  that mostly, and certainly when you put them in a case,
[41:25.260 --> 41:26.100]  look the same.
[41:29.080 --> 41:30.380]  And there are differences.
[41:30.380 --> 41:34.260]  Really, the iPhone 7 is not like the same exact design.
[41:34.260 --> 41:35.980]  You can't put it in the same case.
[41:35.980 --> 41:37.860]  The cameras are very different.
[41:37.860 --> 41:39.020]  There's a different cutout.
[41:39.020 --> 41:40.840]  There is no cutout for the volume buttons
[41:40.840 --> 41:42.900]  like there was on the 6 and 6s.
[41:42.900 --> 41:44.300]  But those differences are subtle.
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.500]  And I know there's a lot of people who think
[41:46.500 --> 41:50.660]  that that's hurt Apple sales that they think in the world.
[41:50.660 --> 41:52.380]  I really just don't think it's true.
[41:52.380 --> 41:54.800]  I mean, I think it's a measurable number of people
[41:54.800 --> 41:57.100]  who want something that looks excitingly new.
[41:57.100 --> 41:59.540]  But I just, and I think that the strength
[41:59.540 --> 42:02.280]  of the iPhone 7 sales really backs that up.
[42:02.280 --> 42:05.080]  The 6 sold extremely well and everybody knew it was
[42:05.080 --> 42:08.620]  because there was pent up demand for a big iPhone.
[42:08.620 --> 42:11.840]  The 6s, the plus actually disappointed.
[42:11.840 --> 42:14.120]  I mean, the Apples came out on conference calls
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.740]  and even said that the 6s plus sold less
[42:16.740 --> 42:17.640]  than they thought it would.
[42:17.640 --> 42:22.640]  And then last year, the 7 plus was backordered for weeks
[42:22.680 --> 42:23.880]  and they came out and said, yeah,
[42:23.880 --> 42:25.800]  it was way stronger demand than we thought.
[42:25.800 --> 42:28.480]  I think personally because of the camera,
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.200]  because I think that you tell even just normal people,
[42:32.200 --> 42:33.560]  this thing has two cameras
[42:33.560 --> 42:35.880]  and it helps you take amazing portrait photos.
[42:35.880 --> 42:38.240]  People totally get that.
[42:38.240 --> 42:40.720]  And everybody I know who's a normal person,
[42:40.720 --> 42:43.280]  their only camera these days is their phone.
[42:43.280 --> 42:44.720]  So a better phone.
[42:44.720 --> 42:47.920]  You say this is a much better camera on this phone
[42:47.920 --> 42:52.560]  that to them it's like sold, get me one of those.
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.560]  And that's why I think the 7 sold so surprisingly
[42:55.560 --> 42:59.120]  or at least more than Apple even expected last year.
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.280]  And I think that the fact that the 7 sold so well
[43:02.280 --> 43:05.960]  puts the lie to the fact that the design has to change
[43:05.960 --> 43:07.160]  to keep people interested.
[43:07.160 --> 43:10.320]  I think it has to change to keep us interested,
[43:10.320 --> 43:12.800]  meaning the tech media,
[43:12.800 --> 43:15.280]  people who write about this every day.
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.600]  But our crowd has to me up to my mind
[43:18.600 --> 43:21.560]  a very short attention span.
[43:21.560 --> 43:26.560]  Well, you know probably better than the most,
[43:27.800 --> 43:29.400]  the worst thing that you can do
[43:29.400 --> 43:31.600]  is change designs for the sake of change.
[43:31.600 --> 43:34.040]  Yes, I totally agree with that.
[43:34.040 --> 43:36.680]  You have something that works, you go with it.
[43:36.680 --> 43:39.440]  I mean, you don't go overboard,
[43:39.440 --> 43:42.480]  but look at car companies like Toyota.
[43:42.480 --> 43:44.800]  Toyota has a great brand.
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.120]  Their cars are known for working well for many, many years
[43:49.120 --> 43:53.440]  and their designs basically stay the same for years on end.
[43:53.440 --> 43:55.760]  And then they'll do it as a change
[43:55.760 --> 43:57.680]  and those designs will stay the same.
[43:57.680 --> 44:02.040]  So getting back to your original question,
[44:03.440 --> 44:06.920]  what would you write come Monday afternoon,
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.240]  the event is over and Apple does not release
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.760]  an edge to edge phone and they release an iPhone 7s plus
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.760]  and 7s, will you write that what a disappointing event?
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  I would take, I would not,
[44:23.040 --> 44:26.480]  and I would try to do what I usually do
[44:26.480 --> 44:28.640]  and try to assess just how much better
[44:28.640 --> 44:32.440]  those two new phones are and take them for what they are.
[44:33.320 --> 44:35.960]  I would be curious if that happened next week,
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.280]  my curiosity wouldn't be that Apple fucked up.
[44:38.280 --> 44:40.520]  It wouldn't be that this is a disaster,
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.960]  they've fallen, they're doomed or whatever,
[44:42.960 --> 44:45.680]  would be curious to me that they didn't set the expectation
[44:45.680 --> 44:48.320]  in advance of the event that it wasn't going to happen.
[44:48.320 --> 44:52.400]  So to me, the more plausible what if scenario would be
[44:52.400 --> 44:54.880]  what if that had already leaked about a month ago.
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.400]  And in that case, I'd be a little disappointed
[44:59.400 --> 45:00.800]  because I'm excited to see the new phone
[45:00.800 --> 45:03.480]  but I totally understand that that's what happens
[45:03.480 --> 45:05.800]  when you make a new product and that's what happens
[45:05.800 --> 45:08.880]  when you have your foot all the way down on the gas pedal
[45:08.880 --> 45:12.360]  in terms of let's get the most advanced technology
[45:12.360 --> 45:14.160]  into this phone that we possibly can.
[45:14.160 --> 45:15.840]  Let's be as aggressive as we can
[45:15.840 --> 45:18.280]  about shipping what we think
[45:18.280 --> 45:20.320]  is the next generation of technology.
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.920]  You know, if you're not running into production problems,
[45:23.920 --> 45:25.160]  you're not pressing hard enough.
[45:25.160 --> 45:27.160]  No, I don't disagree at all.
[45:27.160 --> 45:30.000]  Steven Sinofsky even tweeted that the other day,
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.720]  the guy who used formerly at Microsoft,
[45:32.720 --> 45:35.360]  and now is a big iPad proponent,
[45:36.760 --> 45:39.840]  but he linked to that Wall Street Journal story
[45:39.840 --> 45:41.960]  about the production hitches in summer
[45:41.960 --> 45:46.960]  and said without knowing any details of this in particular,
[45:47.080 --> 45:49.040]  that's what product development is like
[45:49.040 --> 45:50.040]  if you're being aggressive.
[45:50.040 --> 45:52.480]  Like if you're not hitting production problems,
[45:52.480 --> 45:53.960]  you're not pressing hard enough.
[45:53.960 --> 45:54.800]  Yep.
[45:54.800 --> 45:56.760]  And they'll overcome those.
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.240]  You know, it's not an insurmountable problem for them
[46:01.240 --> 46:02.680]  but it's a problem right now.
[46:02.680 --> 46:05.640]  Well, and the problem is that to overcome them,
[46:05.640 --> 46:06.760]  it takes time.
[46:06.760 --> 46:09.240]  And that's the one thing that people in the media
[46:09.240 --> 46:12.400]  don't want to grant Apple is time.
[46:12.400 --> 46:17.400]  Like, all right, let me take another break here
[46:18.440 --> 46:19.640]  and we'll get back and talk more iPhone.
[46:19.640 --> 46:22.880]  But I want to thank our next sponsor.
[46:22.880 --> 46:26.120]  And this one's our good friends at Squarespace.
[46:26.120 --> 46:26.960]  You need a website.
[46:26.960 --> 46:30.320]  If you need a website, go to Squarespace.
[46:30.320 --> 46:34.600]  Go there first and try it and just see how easy it is
[46:34.600 --> 46:37.920]  to do everything from registering the domain name
[46:37.920 --> 46:40.520]  to picking the template to modifying the template
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.960]  to setting up different sections of the site with easy,
[46:43.960 --> 46:46.920]  just drag them in features like a store.
[46:46.920 --> 46:48.040]  Like you need to sell something.
[46:48.040 --> 46:50.440]  Like you can go to Squarespace and you don't have to like
[46:50.440 --> 46:52.960]  do all this e-commerce programming and stuff.
[46:52.960 --> 46:56.000]  No, you just set up, you say I want a store
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.880]  and then you just enter the items you want to sell
[46:58.880 --> 47:01.720]  and the prices and the pictures of them and the descriptions
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.040]  and there it is, you have a beautiful looking store.
[47:05.040 --> 47:05.880]  It's that easy.
[47:05.880 --> 47:08.320]  I mean, and you can do that for things like blogs.
[47:08.320 --> 47:10.000]  You can do it for podcasts.
[47:11.080 --> 47:13.320]  Anything you would need a website for,
[47:13.320 --> 47:15.480]  I swear you could do it at Squarespace.
[47:15.480 --> 47:17.320]  You even get a free domain name if you sign up
[47:17.320 --> 47:20.080]  for a year of service in advance.
[47:20.080 --> 47:23.720]  Intuitive, easy to use, drag and drop visual tools
[47:23.720 --> 47:25.160]  to set it all up.
[47:25.160 --> 47:28.320]  You can get a free trial today at squarespace.com
[47:28.320 --> 47:32.400]  and when you do decide to sign up, use the code talk show,
[47:32.400 --> 47:34.640]  know the just plain old talk show one word
[47:34.640 --> 47:37.920]  and you will get 10% off your first purchase.
[47:37.920 --> 47:40.480]  So do that for a year, save 10% on the whole year
[47:40.480 --> 47:41.720]  and you get a free domain.
[47:41.720 --> 47:44.200]  Go to squarespace.com and remember that code talk show
[47:44.200 --> 47:45.240]  when you do decide to pay.
[47:45.240 --> 47:48.360]  My thanks to Squarespace for their continuing support
[47:48.360 --> 47:49.200]  of the talk show.
[47:50.720 --> 47:52.960]  So what do you think they're gonna call the new iPhones?
[47:52.960 --> 47:55.960]  I'm betting that all three are coming, right?
[47:55.960 --> 47:57.400]  I mean, that seems like about as close
[47:57.400 --> 47:58.800]  to certain as possible.
[47:58.800 --> 48:02.920]  So they could go with the continuing on
[48:02.920 --> 48:04.120]  with what they've done.
[48:04.120 --> 48:09.120]  The 7S and 7S plus and then do an just the iPhone 8
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.440]  which is the big edge to edge, you know,
[48:13.440 --> 48:15.240]  it's the beautiful one.
[48:15.240 --> 48:18.720]  Or they could make them all iPhone 8s
[48:18.720 --> 48:22.880]  and do an iPhone 8 Pro, premium edition,
[48:22.880 --> 48:26.120]  you know, one of those names.
[48:26.120 --> 48:31.120]  But I give it a 50 50 chance either way.
[48:31.480 --> 48:33.600]  I don't think there's any chance
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.040]  they're gonna call those 7S and 7S plus
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.120]  because by all accounts, they're coming in
[48:39.120 --> 48:43.080]  at the same price points as the existing 7 and 7 plus.
[48:43.080 --> 48:45.520]  They're not, it's not like an iPhone 5C
[48:45.520 --> 48:48.480]  where yes, it's a new phone, but it's a new phone
[48:48.480 --> 48:51.720]  that we're targeting at like the mid price tier.
[48:52.600 --> 48:56.000]  So if it's supposed to sell at the existing prices,
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.800]  I think it makes them look bad to call them 7s
[49:00.800 --> 49:02.360]  and call this other one 8.
[49:02.360 --> 49:04.680]  It's like here's, it makes it sound like
[49:04.680 --> 49:06.400]  it's like they're a year behind.
[49:06.400 --> 49:09.560]  Like I think, and this is to me the most intriguing part
[49:09.560 --> 49:11.400]  of the whole event next week is how are they going
[49:11.400 --> 49:15.400]  to product marketing wise position these three phones
[49:15.400 --> 49:20.360]  such that the first two look like the iPhones
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.360]  we would expect in any typical year,
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.280]  like the best phones on the market
[49:24.280 --> 49:27.800]  from the company with the best eye for design.
[49:27.800 --> 49:30.960]  And here's this new thing at a higher tier, right?
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.720]  Like, and I think calling them the first two 7s
[49:35.720 --> 49:38.800]  and calling the other one 8, it says the opposite.
[49:38.800 --> 49:41.000]  It says these two are year old technology
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.520]  even though they're coming out right now.
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.800]  It would make sense to me if the rumor were
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.080]  that the 7s and 7s plus were going to be introduced
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.280]  at like $150 lower price than they currently sell.
[49:51.280 --> 49:53.280]  That would make sense to me if they were sort of
[49:53.280 --> 49:55.920]  like the new version of the iPhone 5C,
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.160]  but that by all accounts, that's not what they're doing.
[49:58.160 --> 50:01.040]  They're introducing two new phones that are what
[50:01.040 --> 50:03.080]  we would expect from Apple on a typical year,
[50:03.080 --> 50:05.600]  which is, you know, and in my opinion,
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.160]  I've said this many times, I think that dollar for dollar,
[50:09.160 --> 50:12.160]  the S models of all iPhones have been better
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.560]  than the non S models.
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.920]  The 3GS was way, maybe it was one of the most
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.680]  biggest updates in iPhone history,
[50:23.680 --> 50:25.640]  even though it looked exactly like the iPhone 3G,
[50:25.640 --> 50:27.480]  it was the speed difference was tremendous.
[50:27.480 --> 50:29.520]  The iPhone 3G was barely an improvement
[50:29.520 --> 50:30.480]  over the original iPhone.
[50:30.480 --> 50:33.880]  The only significant, I think it added GPS, I don't know,
[50:33.880 --> 50:36.120]  but the main thing was that it went from edge networking
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.880]  to 3G, which was, you know, obviously a nice improvement,
[50:39.880 --> 50:41.960]  but everything else like the camera stayed the same,
[50:41.960 --> 50:44.920]  the CPU stayed the same, the graphics stayed the same,
[50:44.920 --> 50:46.160]  the screen stayed the same.
[50:46.160 --> 50:48.720]  The 3GS was a huge update over the 3G.
[50:48.720 --> 50:52.920]  The 4S was a huge update over the iPhone 4, right?
[50:52.920 --> 50:55.360]  The 5S was the one that introduced touch ID.
[50:55.360 --> 51:00.360]  I just think that the S models get underestimated
[51:02.440 --> 51:05.240]  by reviewers just because they look the same,
[51:05.240 --> 51:07.680]  that they just look at it without even using it
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.600]  or testing it or measuring the speed
[51:09.600 --> 51:11.640]  or trying the camera or whatever.
[51:11.640 --> 51:14.600]  They're just like, well, it looks the same, meh.
[51:14.600 --> 51:17.040]  Well, you know what we should do right now
[51:17.040 --> 51:21.520]  to just end all this is conference in Schiller.
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.640]  Just let's just conference in Schiller and we'll ask him.
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.480]  Hey, Phil, sure he'd be happy to talk to us.
[51:28.480 --> 51:31.320]  And I'm sure he's not busy at all on a Friday.
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.200]  No, I'm sure he's not.
[51:33.200 --> 51:36.240]  He's not busy, he's probably taking a nap.
[51:36.240 --> 51:37.960]  Okay, so you're going with.
[51:37.960 --> 51:40.720]  I think it's either going to be iPhone 8,
[51:40.720 --> 51:43.560]  iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 8 Pro,
[51:43.560 --> 51:46.200]  or they drop the numbers and just say,
[51:46.200 --> 51:48.960]  this is the new iPhone, this is the new iPhone Plus,
[51:48.960 --> 51:51.280]  and this is the brand new iPhone Pro,
[51:51.280 --> 51:54.000]  like which is sort of what, which is not even sort of,
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.640]  it's exactly what they've done with the iPad lineup.
[51:56.640 --> 51:59.040]  Yeah, and you know what, to be honest,
[51:59.040 --> 52:00.920]  I would like that option the best.
[52:02.120 --> 52:05.400]  Because at some point the numbers start to get silly,
[52:05.400 --> 52:08.520]  right, it's like, you know, they could do,
[52:08.520 --> 52:11.120]  I don't think it would be ridiculous for them,
[52:11.120 --> 52:13.080]  or I don't think it would be unusual
[52:13.080 --> 52:14.320]  or even the least bit surprising
[52:14.320 --> 52:16.240]  if the iPhone 8 thing is what it turns out.
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.600]  iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 8 Pro.
[52:19.480 --> 52:20.600]  I could totally see them doing it.
[52:20.600 --> 52:22.480]  But at some point, you know, like what?
[52:22.480 --> 52:25.040]  You're gonna have an iPhone 13, you know?
[52:26.440 --> 52:28.280]  Yeah, and at what point does that get weird?
[52:28.280 --> 52:30.440]  At some point they have to drop the numbers, I think.
[52:30.440 --> 52:32.400]  And so why not now,
[52:32.400 --> 52:35.560]  when they're introducing this new Pro model?
[52:35.560 --> 52:37.560]  And I do think they're gonna call it Pro.
[52:40.320 --> 52:42.520]  I could be wrong, I mean, this is the sort of thing
[52:42.520 --> 52:45.200]  that I think that they have kept
[52:45.200 --> 52:46.880]  under complete lock and key.
[52:46.880 --> 52:49.040]  And as you, you know, names and price,
[52:49.040 --> 52:52.020]  product names and prices are like the things
[52:52.020 --> 52:55.680]  that are least likely to leak from Apple.
[52:55.680 --> 52:58.700]  In years past, there were sometimes like prices would leak
[52:58.700 --> 53:01.800]  because it would somehow like prematurely hit
[53:01.800 --> 53:05.340]  the retail channel and somebody in an Apple store
[53:05.340 --> 53:07.320]  would, you know, get like an update.
[53:07.320 --> 53:09.800]  And just some regular person working in an Apple store
[53:09.800 --> 53:10.760]  is like, whoa, you know,
[53:10.760 --> 53:14.000]  here's these new product names and prices.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.160]  And then, you know, email it to, you know,
[53:17.000 --> 53:18.360]  9to5Mac or something.
[53:19.680 --> 53:21.480]  But that hasn't happened in years.
[53:21.480 --> 53:23.440]  And they've just, you know, I mean, even the name,
[53:23.440 --> 53:25.360]  even going back 10 years,
[53:25.360 --> 53:28.240]  the original iPhone name did not leak, right?
[53:28.240 --> 53:30.260]  Remember there was all this, everybody speculated
[53:30.260 --> 53:32.720]  because at the time when Apple was just putting I
[53:32.720 --> 53:36.960]  in front of every name, iPhone was the rumored name
[53:36.960 --> 53:39.060]  for Apple's secret phone project.
[53:39.060 --> 53:39.900]  But remember when Steve-
[53:39.900 --> 53:40.720]  And they didn't even own it.
[53:40.720 --> 53:42.400]  No, and everybody's like, they can't use it
[53:42.400 --> 53:45.180]  because Cisco owns it, or I think it was Cisco.
[53:46.320 --> 53:48.920]  And so it was actually a great moment in the keynote
[53:48.920 --> 53:52.160]  and when Jobs says, and we're gonna call it iPhone.
[53:52.160 --> 53:53.080]  And then the name iPhone,
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.000]  I remember it was like the drop effect
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.920]  and dust came up from the, you know, ground and keynote.
[53:58.920 --> 54:01.180]  And he goes, yeah, that's what we're calling it.
[54:01.180 --> 54:04.020]  Like he knew, like he was addressing the whole,
[54:04.020 --> 54:05.160]  hey, they can't call it iPhone
[54:05.160 --> 54:07.160]  because Cisco owns a trademark on the name iPhone.
[54:07.160 --> 54:09.960]  And he was just like, fuck it, we're calling it iPhone.
[54:11.360 --> 54:12.760]  So names don't leak.
[54:12.760 --> 54:17.400]  So I have absolutely zero inside, no little birdies,
[54:17.400 --> 54:19.880]  no friends of the birdie, no,
[54:19.880 --> 54:23.040]  my cousin has a friend who's married to someone at Apple
[54:23.040 --> 54:24.400]  who told me that they're gonna call it this.
[54:24.400 --> 54:26.480]  I have nothing, nobody's told me a damn thing.
[54:26.480 --> 54:27.880]  I just think they're gonna call it Pro
[54:27.880 --> 54:31.160]  because that's what they call the higher end models.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.380]  That's what they call the MacBook Pro,
[54:32.380 --> 54:33.840]  it's what they call the iPad Pro.
[54:33.840 --> 54:34.960]  Yeah, I agree.
[54:34.960 --> 54:38.480]  I mean, it just, it makes sense, makes sense.
[54:38.480 --> 54:41.440]  That's the only question is, will they drop the number?
[54:41.440 --> 54:45.320]  Yeah, those are my two guesses, I don't know.
[54:45.320 --> 54:47.240]  That's what I feel 50-50 on.
[54:47.240 --> 54:50.680]  But I also feel like giving, if they call them all eight,
[54:50.680 --> 54:52.640]  or if they drop the number on all of them
[54:52.640 --> 54:56.040]  and just go iPhone, iPhone Plus, iPhone Pro,
[54:56.040 --> 55:01.040]  it elevates those to the 4.7 and the 5.5 inch phones
[55:01.060 --> 55:05.320]  to be peers with this new phone, as opposed to,
[55:05.320 --> 55:07.800]  it's a way to position them such that they don't look
[55:07.800 --> 55:10.600]  unappealing even though they're not the highest end models.
[55:10.600 --> 55:11.440]  Yes.
[55:12.440 --> 55:15.040]  Yeah, it's important.
[55:15.040 --> 55:18.640]  I mean, you said it a few minutes ago perfectly,
[55:18.640 --> 55:21.540]  they have to have tiers, but they can't make one
[55:21.540 --> 55:24.680]  seem inferior while having tiers.
[55:24.680 --> 55:29.680]  And you know, this is where the show comes in.
[55:30.160 --> 55:31.560]  This is his expertise.
[55:31.560 --> 55:32.400]  It really is.
[55:32.400 --> 55:36.800]  He has to market this so that somebody doesn't feel like,
[55:36.800 --> 55:40.280]  oh, look at that, look at the iPhone I have to get.
[55:40.280 --> 55:42.560]  You know, they have to say, okay.
[55:42.560 --> 55:46.360]  I think that this is the, this is one of the hardest things
[55:46.360 --> 55:49.520]  that Schiller and his team have had to do in Apple history.
[55:49.520 --> 55:50.340]  Yes.
[55:50.340 --> 55:52.220]  You know, it's both, it's two things too.
[55:52.220 --> 55:55.360]  It's the original message, which is what they say
[55:55.360 --> 55:58.520]  on stage in the keynote to set the,
[55:58.520 --> 56:01.960]  here's our version of the story of these products
[56:01.960 --> 56:05.180]  that we want to seed into the head of the public
[56:05.180 --> 56:07.600]  who's watching, you know, all the millions of people
[56:07.600 --> 56:10.160]  who watch these streams live and us, the media,
[56:10.160 --> 56:11.800]  who are gonna be writing about them, you know,
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.840]  to try to, you know, get us to see it the same way
[56:15.840 --> 56:17.300]  they want us to see it.
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.600]  And secondarily, which is totally different,
[56:20.600 --> 56:22.560]  is the ad campaigns for these products,
[56:22.560 --> 56:24.360]  is how do they come up with ad campaigns
[56:24.360 --> 56:26.120]  that accomplish the same thing,
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.600]  make the new regular iPhones seem desirable and new
[56:30.600 --> 56:33.300]  and much improved and desirable,
[56:33.300 --> 56:37.080]  and at the same time introduce this new pro model
[56:37.080 --> 56:39.400]  at a higher price that doesn't diminish demand
[56:39.400 --> 56:43.760]  for the, you know, the existing tiered prices,
[56:43.760 --> 56:45.440]  tiered models.
[56:45.440 --> 56:47.440]  It's a challenge, it really is.
[56:47.440 --> 56:50.160]  So interesting to see how they do it.
[56:50.160 --> 56:53.240]  Like, is it going to be like a totally separate ad campaign
[56:53.240 --> 56:55.920]  for the pro as opposed to the regular iPhones,
[56:55.920 --> 56:58.660]  or do they do one ad campaign that includes them all?
[56:58.660 --> 57:01.240]  I totally, I don't know.
[57:01.240 --> 57:02.500]  I don't think that they can.
[57:02.500 --> 57:07.500]  I think that, you know, this pro
[57:07.500 --> 57:11.280]  is going to be marketed completely different
[57:11.280 --> 57:13.880]  than what the other ones are.
[57:14.900 --> 57:16.540]  I think so too. I really do.
[57:16.540 --> 57:18.220]  I, it's going to be,
[57:19.540 --> 57:21.860]  I think that's where a lot of the focus is going to be
[57:21.860 --> 57:26.860]  because people are going to know about the updated models,
[57:27.400 --> 57:30.740]  but this new one, it's going to be brand new and shiny
[57:30.740 --> 57:32.420]  and it's going to be spectacular
[57:32.420 --> 57:35.060]  and they're going to market the hell out of that.
[57:35.060 --> 57:38.040]  There's also been a rumor and it seems like
[57:38.040 --> 57:41.660]  so much of the attention is on the pro, the D22 one.
[57:41.660 --> 57:44.020]  I mean, not even seems like the attention
[57:44.020 --> 57:45.540]  really is on that model.
[57:45.540 --> 57:48.780]  And the so-called 7S and 7S Plus
[57:48.780 --> 57:51.540]  are almost like afterthoughts in all the rumors.
[57:51.540 --> 57:55.020]  And I think that's so curious and so indicative
[57:55.020 --> 57:57.980]  of how small minded the media is,
[57:57.980 --> 57:59.940]  how narrowly focused it can be.
[57:59.940 --> 58:02.700]  Because I would guess that we're getting updates
[58:02.700 --> 58:06.340]  as good as the S updates we'd expect in a normal year.
[58:06.340 --> 58:08.900]  You know, which is typically, like I said,
[58:08.900 --> 58:11.580]  usually a bigger improvement than the other way around.
[58:11.580 --> 58:14.140]  Like it might be, I would expect that these two phones
[58:14.140 --> 58:16.980]  are better than the 7, they're corresponding,
[58:16.980 --> 58:18.480]  you know, the 7 and 7 Plus,
[58:18.480 --> 58:21.580]  than the 7 was from the 6S and the 6S Plus.
[58:21.580 --> 58:25.020]  I think I'm willing to bet that
[58:25.020 --> 58:28.600]  if there is a hands-on area at this event on Tuesday,
[58:28.600 --> 58:31.880]  that when we go in there,
[58:31.880 --> 58:35.400]  there will be nobody at the 7S and 7S Plus table,
[58:35.400 --> 58:37.500]  and everybody will be at the 8 table.
[58:37.500 --> 58:38.340]  I remember that.
[58:38.340 --> 58:40.760]  I remember the one event when they first came out
[58:40.760 --> 58:44.400]  with the, I think it's still the current form factor
[58:44.400 --> 58:47.540]  of the iPod Touch, the one that originally shipped
[58:47.540 --> 58:49.960]  with an optional wrist lanyard.
[58:51.420 --> 58:53.120]  I don't think they've changed the industrial design
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.780]  since then, other than getting rid of the thing
[58:55.780 --> 58:58.720]  for the wrist lanyard, the little pop-out thing.
[58:58.720 --> 59:02.640]  But I remember that event, the hands-on area,
[59:02.640 --> 59:04.960]  I came out and I was with a friend of the show,
[59:04.960 --> 59:07.280]  off-frequent guest, M.G. Siegler,
[59:07.280 --> 59:08.560]  back when he was, I think he was writing
[59:08.560 --> 59:10.140]  for TechCrunch at the time.
[59:10.140 --> 59:14.140]  And it was like three or four deep around the iPhone.
[59:14.140 --> 59:16.440]  It was either the 4 or the 4S, I think.
[59:16.440 --> 59:17.280]  Or maybe it was, I don't know,
[59:17.280 --> 59:18.320]  I think it was the iPhone 5.
[59:18.320 --> 59:19.720]  It was the first year of the iPhone 5.
[59:19.720 --> 59:23.680]  And the iPod Touch table, there was literally nobody there.
[59:23.680 --> 59:27.040]  So we just went there and it was so much more enjoyable
[59:27.040 --> 59:28.680]  because, okay, it wasn't the product
[59:28.680 --> 59:31.440]  I was most interested in, but it was,
[59:31.440 --> 59:33.920]  we had the room, we could completely examine it.
[59:33.920 --> 59:36.280]  We could talk to the people, the Apple people
[59:36.280 --> 59:39.080]  who were there to answer our questions about it.
[59:39.080 --> 59:40.800]  And meanwhile, everybody at the other one,
[59:40.800 --> 59:44.640]  it was like a fight over Cabbage Patch dolls in 1985.
[59:44.640 --> 59:48.580]  Yeah, and that's what it's like at every event.
[59:49.960 --> 59:51.800]  And there's nothing Apple can do.
[59:51.800 --> 59:55.120]  It's us, it's not them.
[59:55.120 --> 59:57.200]  And it's not, you know, we were talking earlier
[59:57.200 --> 59:59.020]  about their flow or any, and it's got nothing
[59:59.020 --> 59:59.860]  to do with that.
[59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.040]  It's just the way that the press.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.700]  Well, and one of the ways that the,
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.320]  if we, to stroll back down memory lane again,
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.040]  and the way that, I mean, you've been going to events,
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.240]  like you said, since 1999.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.840]  So you've got way more years under your belt than me.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.320]  I think I started getting press passes
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.320]  to Macworld around 2006 or so, maybe 2005, but 2006.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.200]  So like when I got to press pass for the iPhone one
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.320]  in January 2007, it was still one of the, you know,
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.080]  like the third or fourth event
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.720]  that I'd gotten a press pass for.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.600]  But just in the last 10 years,
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.680]  one of the ways that's changed absolutely,
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.800]  and it's just totally changed the flow of these events
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.180]  is the obsession with shooting video and photographs.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:47.540]  It just wasn't a thing back then,
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.620]  because, I mean, it's certainly for video.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.300]  There was just no way to get video online,
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:55.940]  you know, remotely.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.860]  It was just too big.
[01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:59.320]  Bandwidth was too slow.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.440]  Cameras were too big.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.980]  Now it's all video.
[01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.260]  It's video, video, video, video, and product shots.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.380]  And I've said this before,
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.660]  but it really changes the dynamic of the hands-on area
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.820]  is that once somebody from these media outlets
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.580]  gets to, you know, now they can hold the new iPhone.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.020]  They have, it's like a team, and they have a, you know,
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.600]  here's the person who's gonna hold it,
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.100]  and here's the photographer.
[01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.540]  But to get the shot they want, they need space.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.240]  You know, they don't just wanna stick the camera
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.080]  right up there.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.980]  They wanna put a longer lens on.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.820]  And it really does get ugly, you know, where they're,
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.060]  because they, you know,
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.380]  and if you're not really paying attention,
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.500]  if you're just trying to walk around, you might walk,
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.580]  you know, there's enough space
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.060]  between the photographer and the reporter
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.020]  that you could easily inadvertently just walk
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.260]  in front of them, because it's crowded,
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.220]  and there's hundreds of people there.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.980]  And it really does change, and then,
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.400]  because it means that they need so much space around them
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.540]  that it's no longer packed tables.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.140]  It's people, and they're pushing people.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.740]  It's real ugly.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.420]  Well, it's, it is a weird situation,
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.460]  but, you know, for, I think for many of us
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.780]  that have been there for a long time, like you said,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.780]  we're just kinda, you know, we're willing to hang out.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.400]  But some of these guys that get in there these days
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.820]  are just, like they're going elbows up.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:16.760]  Remember last year with the jet black iPhone?
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.860]  That's the one everybody wanted to get pictures of.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.580]  But it's really hard to photograph.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.180]  Like, it's, you know, it, for obvious reasons,
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:31.180]  it's, you know, like I had friends who had a black pug,
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.580]  you know, the dog, just jet black hair with black eyes.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:39.100]  Adorable, adorable little dog.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.140]  The hardest damn thing to take a photo of
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.860]  is, there's just no way to get the light right.
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.920]  Like, your eyes can totally see this adorable pug face
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.440]  and these adorable eyes looking at you,
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.360]  and then your camera just sees, like, a black pillow.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.340]  And so, people last year trying to set up shots
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.460]  of the jet black iPhone, they'd take the shot,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.580]  and then the photographer would chimp, you know,
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.120]  did you ever hear that verb, chimping?
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.800]  Chimping is when you, like, have like a SLR,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.160]  you take a picture, and then you look at the screen
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.960]  to see if you got the shot, you know,
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.700]  and you're up to your eyes, take a shot,
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.900]  look at the screen, just over and over and over again,
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.940]  playing with the exposure and trying to get it
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.020]  positioned in the light just so.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.120]  And it's like, you're not in a photo studio here,
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.980]  you're in a working press room with 250 members
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.620]  of the media who all want the same phone,
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.900]  and meanwhile, you know, tilt it a quarter of an inch
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.940]  this way, catch the light, it was, ugh, it was maddening.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.940]  Let me think, what else?
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:36.120]  What do you think the price is gonna start on the Pro model?
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.120]  Well, I mean, I think 1,000 to 1,200.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.820]  I think 999 is their goal, and it's probably,
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:49.220]  as a starting price, so that tricked out plus
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.860]  of, you know, iPhone 8 Plus or whatever, 7S Plus,
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.700]  whatever they're gonna call it, the 5.5 inch one,
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.540]  I would think would have the same price as last year,
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.500]  $969 for the one with the most storage.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.420]  And then if that's the existing,
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.220]  and that's the existing high price, 969,
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:08.420]  then if the new one starts at 999,
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.980]  it seems like it's a continuous flow of prices
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.480]  from the, whatever the, you know,
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.480]  the lowest memory storage config of the iPhone 7 is up to.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.620]  But I would guess that they'd have at least two tiers,
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:26.160]  you know, maybe like 64 gigs and 256 or something like that,
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.440]  you know, with $100 bump in between them,
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.260]  or maybe $200, I don't know.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:35.940]  Like, I could totally see it going up to $1,200.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.860]  Yeah, so could I.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.940]  But, you know, people have been talking about this,
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:42.580]  you know, the price of this thing,
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:47.460]  like it's gonna collapse the market, and it's not,
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.240]  but I think mentally we have a ceiling,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.100]  you know, a $1,000 price point,
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.460]  and then things start to ramp up again, you know?
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:03.940]  So anything under $1,000, I think we're okay with.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.480]  But once you say $1,000, then you're thinking,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.720]  oh my God, $1,000, that's a lot of money.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.560]  But 999, that's perfectly fine.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.400]  The people who are upset about it
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.180]  are the people who are enthusiasts
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.620]  and like the idea that they've always got,
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:20.460]  they have the best iPhone they could buy,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.700]  and who also don't want to, or either can't or won't,
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.240]  pay over $1,000 for an iPhone.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.540]  So now they're torn, because they always had the best iPhone
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.600]  that money could buy,
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.460]  and they can't buy the new best iPhone that money can buy,
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:38.540]  or won't buy the new best iPhone that money can buy.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.460]  And so those people are upset.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:44.020]  I mean, they've been vocal ever since rumors of this
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.220]  started hitting, and they certainly were vocal
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:49.620]  when I wrote about what the prices might be
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:51.060]  earlier this summer.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.180]  And I understand it, they're not wrong, right?
[01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.220]  If that's how you feel, or if that's your budget.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:58.580]  I mean, but I think that they take it too far
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.460]  when they say, I've also heard the argument
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.580]  that they either won't or shouldn't call it
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:07.020]  the iPhone Pro, emphasis on Pro,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.540]  because with MacBooks and even iPads,
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.720]  that Pro makes sense because they're tools
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.060]  people use for work, and that somebody who buys
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.340]  a MacBook Pro instead of a MacBook Air
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.400]  or a regular MacBook is doing so
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:23.660]  because they have professional needs for work that require.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.580]  I don't agree with that.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.940]  I, A, don't agree with it on the MacBook Pro
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.260]  and the iPad Pro, especially the iPad Pro,
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.660]  although some people do use it
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.940]  as more of a professional tool.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.180]  I also think that Apple has long used the word Pro
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:41.180]  to mean deluxe, or better, more expensive.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.980]  And when you asked earlier what the names would be,
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.500]  those are iPad edition, because they've used that
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.980]  for the top of the line.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:55.820]  So yeah, Pro is, to Apple, like you said,
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.540]  to me, it's a deluxe model, top of the line.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:00.740]  And secondarily, though, here's the other,
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:01.580]  the flip side of it.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.300]  So I don't think, and the ways they have used
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.700]  the word Pro in product names,
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.020]  it doesn't always necessarily mean for professional use.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.740]  But on the flip side, I think that an iPhone
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:17.260]  for professional use, that's an actual thing.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.300]  That's part of the ways that the world has changed
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.660]  since 10 years ago, when the first iPhone came out,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.060]  is that there are an awful lot of people I know
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:28.280]  who their most used work computer is their phone.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.500]  Awful lot of people.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.740]  And either all the time, or some of the time.
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.660]  And I've said this before, Matthew Pansarino,
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.640]  who is the editor of TechCrunch,
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.940]  and Nilay Patel at The Verge, I've talked to.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.240]  Both of them have said the same thing to me,
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.580]  that there are days where, if they're traveling
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.460]  or something, their entire communication
[01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.660]  with their editorial staff goes through their phone.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.300]  It's the life, and those are publications
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.300]  where there are stories coming out every hour
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.460]  throughout the day.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.340]  And as the people who run the publication,
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.700]  they need to be in charge, they need to be
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.220]  in communication with their staff all day.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.820]  Their phone is the only, that's the number one device
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.420]  on some days for them, as a professional tool.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.020]  And what are the things that professionals need
[01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:14.860]  out of their phone?
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:16.140]  Well, one of them is battery life.
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:20.060]  So if this iPhone Pro, because it has an OLED screen,
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.500]  and OLED takes less energy than LCD,
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.900]  and if it's because of the new shape,
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.660]  if they're able to put a bigger battery in there,
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.860]  and if they can advertise that it has
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.820]  significantly better battery life,
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:37.140]  or at least as much battery life as the Plus,
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.220]  but in a form factor that feels in your hand
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.620]  closer to a regular iPhone,
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.540]  that is a legitimate professional feature.
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:47.220]  Your phone going dead before the day is done
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.340]  is a professional problem, it really is.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:53.100]  And secondarily, the camera, if the camera is better,
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.420]  that's a professional, that is a pro feature.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:57.060]  There are people who use their phones
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.980]  to take pictures in a professional context.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.740]  Part of their job is taking pictures.
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:07.420]  I don't even give that whole pro thing any thought at all.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.900]  I just don't, I just don't agree with it
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:13.960]  to the point where I don't even think about it.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.620]  You know, I just, I can use my phone
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.600]  for a computer if I want.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.780]  I choose not to, but I can, you know?
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:28.220]  So if they have something that's better,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.500]  you know, better chips, and better networking,
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.660]  and better screen, and all of this kind of stuff,
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.420]  I mean, the one big question that I have,
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:39.420]  and I tweeted maybe about a week ago,
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:41.940]  the only thing that I really want out of a new iPhone
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:45.180]  is to be able to read it in the sun, you know?
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.620]  Will I be able to do that with this new screen?
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.660]  I don't know, I hope so.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.460]  You know, and it's funny, the people who think
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.940]  that they can't call it pro is that the pre-iPhone
[01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.260]  smartphone world, like when they used to call them
[01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:01.400]  smartphones, and Blackberry was a thing,
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.820]  they were all professional.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.460]  You know, the entire, all the, you know,
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:07.540]  the advertising campaigns for all of those things
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.420]  were, you know, people in business suits.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:14.400]  You know, and it was meant for people who work
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.100]  at like a big corporate with a, quote, enterprise,
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.620]  you know, IT division and stuff like that.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.380]  So I just think it's silly to think they wouldn't.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.780]  I also think, this is one of those things
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.660]  that I wanted to touch on, is among the things
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.740]  we don't know about this new phone is
[01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.500]  we don't really know anything about the camera.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.700]  Like, and the camera is a huge, it's probably the,
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.940]  it's the centerpiece of like the last two years
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:40.580]  of iPhone advertising is the shot with iPhone
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.640]  advertising campaign.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.540]  It's literally like the number one thing
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:46.500]  that Apple uses to advertise phones now.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:50.980]  I would presume that the 7S and 7S Plus
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.700]  will get the sort of upgrades to their camera
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:55.880]  that we're used to them getting every year,
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.980]  which is significant.
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.780]  It's one of those things that you really can
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.420]  just take a year old iPhone and see the difference,
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.840]  you know, but I would think that the iPhone Pro
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.420]  is gonna get an even better camera.
[01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:09.820]  And I think it may not be about the lens and sensor.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.320]  I think it's about that depth sensor
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.020]  that it's rumored to have, you know,
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:18.020]  that it's, that using an entirely different sensor
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:23.020]  for 3D depth perception combined with having two lenses
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:27.100]  and it could, and, you know, through the magic of software
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:32.100]  could lead to a serious like, oh my God, that's amazing.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.120]  I can't believe that came out of a phone photography.
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.100]  I don't know, that would be very exciting to me.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.280]  I agree, I agree.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.280]  And anything that they can do to help with photography
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.440]  and video and, you know, all of that
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.340]  is just gonna help sales because that is a huge thing.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:54.620]  And the camera is one thing that's gonna be huge
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:59.300]  for consumers and pros.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.980]  Yeah, I think there's a reason, I think there's, you know,
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.180]  it's just gonna be huge.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.820]  I think there's a reason why that there's so much
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.420]  and for so long they've been using this shot
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.240]  with iPhone advertising campaign.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.620]  Because I really, I think it works with regular people.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.660]  Other names I've seen tossed about
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.300]  and I don't think they will use them.
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.100]  Some people have suggested they would call this
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.500]  the new, the high end, highfalutin phone,
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.160]  the iPhone edition.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.220]  I don't think they would do.
[01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.780]  I mean, obviously they've used that name
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.420]  for Apple Watch twice.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.900]  But I think the way they've used it with Apple Watch,
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.700]  especially the first time with the gold ones,
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.140]  but even with the ceramic one from last year,
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:39.340]  which is, you know, significantly lower in price
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:40.860]  and therefore far more approachable
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.280]  than the gold ones were.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.420]  The name edition, it says even,
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.140]  it's not just the judging the products for themselves
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.580]  at, you know, $20,000 digital watches,
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:58.220]  but just the name edition, it was meant to be sort of
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.020]  like an asterisk almost in the, you know,
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.860]  like a footnote in the product line.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.060]  This is something that is not going to sell
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.420]  in massive quantity.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.660]  And I don't think that's gonna be,
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:12.500]  that's not gonna be the case with the iPhone at all,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.860]  you know, and it's, it may not be the best selling one.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.420]  This may actually change the dynamics of the product mix.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.620]  But it's, you know, much like the iPad Pro,
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:27.060]  I think it's, you know, and I think the iPad Pro
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:28.620]  is certainly not the best selling iPad.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.140]  I think that the lower priced ones,
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.100]  I think, you know, right now,
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.540]  probably the best selling iPad has got to be that
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.780]  just plain iPad, you know, the one that starts at like 379.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.180]  But they certainly sell far more iPad Pros
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.940]  than they sell Apple Watch editions.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.780]  Like edition just is too, it's too rarefied.
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:49.100]  And I don't think that's what their intent
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.500]  with this phone is at all.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:58.500]  No, well, this is not a rarefied iPhone.
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.620]  This is the future of the company right here.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.700]  So they have to position it as such.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.260]  You know, yes, it's gonna be, by all reports,
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:10.980]  hard to get ahold of for a little bit.
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.380]  But this is the future.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.620]  This is the way the iPhone is going.
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:16.220]  Oh, what about the rumor that all three iPhones
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.460]  are gonna have glass backs?
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:21.940]  I feel like that's gotten remarkably little attention.
[01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:23.820]  And the idea is that they need to,
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.060]  because they're all going to support contact charging,
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.060]  whatever you want to call it.
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.700]  No, I hate that, wireless charging.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.860]  But, you know, but you put it on a little pad
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.740]  and it'll just charge on the pad.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.220]  And that you can't do that with an aluminum back.
[01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.100]  That to me would be, if that's true,
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.220]  and I feel like it's really been under rumored,
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.340]  especially on the lower two ones,
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.540]  then there's no way they're gonna call them the 7S
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:51.180]  and the 7S Plus, because they only use the S
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:53.420]  when they literally look the same.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.980]  And obviously, having a glass back would not look the same.
[01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.260]  Well, and that would be one of these features
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:08.100]  that, like you said, they would change the name for.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.620]  Because here you go, this is significantly different
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:13.140]  because we've updated the camera
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.860]  and we've got a glass back so it does the contact charging.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:20.180]  And we've done all of these different things.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.100]  And you know, every year, the S editions
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.820]  always get updated components inside.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.140]  So they're, like you said before,
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.820]  they're always faster and they're better and everything else.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.220]  So that is just another reason
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:36.260]  why calling them all iPhone 8s would make sense.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.660]  Because here you're getting all of this technology as well,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.100]  just in, you know.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.140]  Yeah, and if they all have this glass back,
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.980]  I can envision some kind of photograph
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.900]  that shows all three from behind
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.860]  and makes them look like a family.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.780]  From behind, they would look like they're all,
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:57.980]  like here's three amazing new iPhones,
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:59.420]  not just one amazing new iPhone
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.460]  and two other ones that you don't even care about, right?
[01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.060]  And whereas from the front, you won't get that
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.740]  because you'll have two that have this traditional
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.100]  chin and forehead at the top and bottom
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.740]  and one that doesn't and has this cutout around the screen
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:17.380]  that makes it look, gives it a different silhouette
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.980]  as like a, what it looks like when the screen is on.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.980]  From the front, it's definitely gonna look like
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.860]  there's one phone that's not like the others.
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.140]  But from the back, if they all have a glass design,
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.940]  some kind of glass, that would be interesting.
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.100]  I think that's interesting too though
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:36.340]  because they had glass backs and then moved away from it.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.660]  And then to go back to it would be interesting
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.620]  because that's not something Apple usually do
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.820]  when they change materials,
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:43.940]  they usually just go in one order.
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.540]  You know, like they had the titanium G4 power book
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:51.500]  and it was amazing and sort of, in my opinion,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.420]  is probably the most influential design Apple
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:59.180]  in the computer world as ever, in PC world has ever had.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.660]  Because even today's MacBooks still to me
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.300]  seem like they're derived from that G4 titanium.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.620]  You know, like I can, there's like this progression.
[01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:11.100]  I mean, and it's obviously thicker
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.980]  and the keyboard was definitely way different.
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.940]  But it was just sort of like,
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:18.660]  that's the look of the modern Apple notebook
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.500]  compared to all the black plastic ones
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500]  that came before it, right?
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.340]  But anyway.
[01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:26.900]  Well, I think if they could have stayed with aluminum
[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.460]  or a different type of metal, they probably would have.
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.620]  When they switched from titanium to aluminum,
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.380]  they didn't go back to titanium three years later, right?
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.740]  There was a reason why they switched.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:39.140]  It was like, because the titanium could flake off.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.780]  I think it was like painted or something.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.380]  You know, it didn't wear that well.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.620]  And the breakthrough with aluminum was when they got to,
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:49.380]  they don't even talk about unibody anymore,
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.060]  but the fact that they could make these,
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:56.300]  their ability to drill out a solid block of aluminum
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:00.900]  in one continuous shape, you know, it was the breakthrough.
[01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.260]  So it would be, it's interesting to me
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:04.380]  that they would go back to glass.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.820]  And I wonder if there's some part of this
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.300]  because, you know, that we're missing,
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:11.140]  that it's not just glass, like the iPhone 4 and 4S were,
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:14.380]  that it's some other type of glass or, you know,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:15.900]  that there's some other aspect to the story
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.540]  that we just, nobody even knows yet.
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.300]  Well, I'm sure that that will come up.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.260]  Oh, I bet.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.100]  Let me think, anything else on the iPhone?
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.960]  Got the camera, got the glass back.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:33.020]  Think it's gonna have a headphone jack?
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.020]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.860]  I mean, did you see the story?
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.820]  I gotta put it in the show notes.
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.980]  I don't know if you saw it in the shared note,
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.220]  but there's this YouTube video from a guy.
[01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.980]  It's like a half hour video of how he made,
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.940]  how he added a headphone jack to his iPhone 7.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.020]  Like, literally.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.660]  I wouldn't, I don't want anything to do with that.
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.600]  And then when he says,
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.780]  oh, the Taptic Engine is still in the way,
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:00.860]  I was going, no, no, no.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.420]  It's a fascinating video.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.420]  I really enjoyed it.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.800]  Because I just enjoy, I enjoy seeing somebody
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.700]  with an obsession.
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.140]  And this obviously became his obsession.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.860]  But I don't understand it at all.
[01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:17.420]  I mean, this guy spent four months doing this.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.900]  I don't know if he lives in China full time,
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:23.240]  but he's obviously like an electronics enthusiast.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:25.060]  And so it was interesting to me to get a peek
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.420]  at those markets in Shenzhen,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.280]  where you buy all this amazing stuff.
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.260]  Did you see the part?
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:36.500]  It was like early on where he needed to buy a new
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:40.180]  USB microscope because his old one was a piece of junk.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:42.580]  And so he goes to the store and gets one.
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:45.740]  And it's not like buying,
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:49.640]  it's like just in a brown box with no labeling at all.
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.660]  It's just like a brown box that he's buying
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:54.040]  a USB microscope.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.540]  But the saleswoman asked if he'd like her
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.500]  to set it up for him.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.320]  And he was like, sure.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.780]  So she opened it up, assembled the whole thing.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.760]  Like it needed assembly.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.620]  She did the assembly for him, then powered it on,
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.260]  showed him how everything works,
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:10.120]  and then packaged it back up and he was on his way.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:11.740]  Like it's a type of service.
[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.180]  You just don't get that anymore.
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.420]  I mean, arguably you could get that,
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.860]  you get it sort of at the Apple stores,
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.680]  but like when you go to Best Buy,
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.900]  they don't like offer to put the stuff together for you
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:24.100]  for free and test it and make sure it works.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:25.740]  Yeah, it was an incredible video,
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:28.180]  but it scared me more than anything else.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.020]  Oh, you know what's funny?
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:34.020]  And I thought the same thing where it's a sign of my old age
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.400]  where I'm thinking, oh man, you know,
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.660]  screwing around with the inside of your phone like that.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.540]  Like basically I didn't finish it yet.
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.060]  So I'm not quite sure if he actually,
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:44.300]  if this is the technique he worked,
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.740]  but like 20 minutes in,
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:50.740]  his strategy was to use one of Apple's lightning to USB
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:55.060]  or lightning to headphone jack adapters,
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.220]  put that in the phone itself
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.060]  and then wire the lightning end
[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.820]  and solder it to the lightning connector
[01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:01.940]  on the back of the phone,
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.500]  where the actual lightning connector was.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.220]  So in other words, the basic idea
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.280]  of how he added a headphone jack to his phone
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.060]  is he embedded the lightning to headphone jack
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.060]  inside the phone and then drilled a hole
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:15.580]  where you could plug the thing in.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.700]  But he had, like you said,
[01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:20.140]  he had to like move things around on the logic board.
[01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.260]  Yeah, it was just, I was cringing.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:25.320]  Well, my thought, my old man caution, caution
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.580]  is especially after last year's whole thing
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.220]  with the Galaxy Notes,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:31.300]  it wasn't like people were hacking their Galaxy Notes.
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.500]  It's like right out of the factory
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.220]  the things were catching fire.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.220]  And it's like, there's a part of me that ever since that,
[01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:43.220]  I mean, we all know lithium batteries can be dangerous
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:47.780]  and that it's a very tricky part of all of our daily lives,
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.740]  all these devices we have
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:51.340]  that literally have dangerous batteries inside them.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.780]  Like screwing around with your phone like that
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:58.220]  seems like a fire in your pants ready to happen.
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.500]  Just waiting.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:03.500]  Right, so like it's all,
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.260]  I'm like that in all ways of life.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:06.980]  Like when I was younger, like as a teenager,
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:08.220]  I used to ride a skateboard.
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.220]  And so like I see kids on the street
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.020]  doing tricks on their skateboard or something like that.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.660]  I used to think like, wow, that was a cool trick.
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:16.780]  That's pretty cool, that looks cool.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.620]  And now I see it, I think,
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.140]  oh my God, that kid's gonna kill himself.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.980]  Yeah.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:24.980]  You know, I've seen kids just go sailing
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.080]  right through a red light on an intersection
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.180]  on a skateboard, you know,
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.800]  just I guess trusting their ears
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.300]  that they don't hear any cars coming.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.380]  And when I was younger, I would think,
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:36.580]  man, that's a bad-ass move.
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.180]  And now I think, oh my God, that's a death wish.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:40.140]  Yeah, you're dead.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:42.580]  I wish there was a police officer here
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.740]  to pull you over and give you a stern lecture.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.020]  That's what I kept thinking about this guy with his phone.
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.180]  It's like, I feel like you've just made
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.820]  like a bomb ready to go off.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:56.260]  Yeah, well, and when he started drilling into the casing,
[01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:00.340]  I was going, oh, oh, no, no, don't do that.
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:01.220]  Don't do that.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.340]  But he did.
[01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.060]  More power to him if that's what he wants.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.060]  It just seems so not worth it to me.
[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.060]  It really is like the no headphone jack.
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.380]  I know, it's trade-offs.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.140]  I've said this ever since last year.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:19.380]  I'm not saying it's a complete win,
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.060]  but it's like a two steps forward,
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.540]  one step back type thing.
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.500]  There's more steps forward than steps back.
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.660]  And it's fine.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:27.980]  It's just fine.
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:30.580]  Even if you don't buy AirPods, but you should buy AirPods,
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.860]  it's just fine.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.700]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.860]  Do you think we'll see any updates to AirPods?
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.700]  I do not.
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.540]  I think it's too soon.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:40.460]  I know they were announced at last year's event,
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:44.020]  but they didn't ship until like just before Christmas.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:46.100]  So even though they were announced a year ago,
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.780]  I feel like it's not even a year old product yet.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:51.300]  And the fact that they're still behind,
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.780]  a couple of weeks behind on the ones that we already have,
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.220]  I really don't think we'll see AirPods.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.700]  I just think, I think the best we can hope for
[01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.220]  is that they can catch up with demand.
[01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.380]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.820]  I think that they'll catch up
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.980]  before they'll release anything new with that.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.260]  The only thing I can think of is maybe
[01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:14.940]  if they've identified some aspect of the production
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:18.940]  that this is why we're unable to make them fast enough.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.980]  And if they could design,
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:24.980]  do something internally to fix that, they would.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:26.700]  But I almost feel like if they did that,
[01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:28.340]  it would be like a silent update.
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.220]  Like it would be the, what are they gonna do?
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.180]  Change the way they look?
[01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:32.340]  I doubt that.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.100]  No.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.540]  So I don't think so.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:38.940]  Well, what about Apple Watch?
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.940]  That's a very good question.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.900]  Why don't we take a break here and thank our next sponsor
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.100]  and then we'll talk about Apple Watch.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:48.060]  And our next sponsor is Casper.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.500]  The Casper mattress was designed by a team of 20 engineers,
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:54.980]  perfected by a community of nearly half a million sleepers.
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.980]  It's just the truth that most people,
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.100]  you don't think that there's like science behind a mattress,
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.460]  but people at Casper really do.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.540]  They're not just like a name
[01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.860]  that they buy white label mattresses
[01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.300]  and put a Casper sticker on them and ship them to you.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:14.300]  Like they literally are a team full of mattress engineers.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.780]  I love it.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.860]  But they, and they,
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.980]  you don't think about your mattress, but they do.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.380]  They think about every single aspect of it.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:28.580]  And it combines what they have is one type of mattress.
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:31.900]  You don't have to make complicated decisions about,
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.220]  do you want this foam or do you want these Springs
[01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:35.340]  or do you want this or that?
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.100]  You just pick a size and their mattress
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.340]  has just the right sink, just the right bounce.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.180]  It's great.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.020]  We have them here in the house.
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:42.860]  We love them.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.260]  And, and here's my thing.
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.580]  I know people say this all the time.
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.020]  You spend one third of your life sleeping.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.540]  I spend about half my life sleeping.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:53.900]  I love to sleep.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.620]  Why, why not?
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.900]  Of all the things that you can spend money on
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.100]  to improve your life.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:03.460]  This is something that proves literally eight, eight, nine,
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:05.940]  seven, eight, nine hours every single day
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:06.900]  you can make your life better.
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.700]  If you have like, if you're like,
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.420]  got like an old crummy mattress right now
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.820]  and you're like, well, maybe I should replace it.
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.660]  Why not?
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.500]  Why wait?
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.340]  I mean, you're, you're, you know,
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:16.740]  we're all gonna die eventually.
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:18.260]  How about you spend as much of that time
[01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.180]  with a great mattress that feels great every single night.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.700]  Here's what the thing you gotta remember.
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.660]  I always say this, but they have a hundred night free trial.
[01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.980]  So you can't lose.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.220]  So like the whole aspect that you don't get to try it
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.300]  in a scummy little mattress showroom before you try,
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.620]  just go there, pick the size, they ship it to you
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.140]  and you get a hundred nights to sleep with it.
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:40.700]  And if you don't like it, they literally with no hassle,
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.940]  no question, will give you a full refund
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.900]  and come pick it up.
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:46.180]  It's, it's, you can't lose with it.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:49.140]  It's, if you look, they've got over 20,000 reviews
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.900]  on Amazon and Google and their average score
[01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:54.340]  is 4.8 out of five.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.140]  It really is super popular.
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.340]  Designed, developed and assembled right here in the USA.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.660]  So if you wanna learn more, go to casper.com
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:06.100]  slash the talk show, casper.com, the talk show
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.420]  slash the talk show.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.220]  And with that code, the talk show,
[01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:11.780]  you can save 50 bucks towards any mattress.
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.820]  There's terms and conditions that apply.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.100]  And I don't know what those terms and conditions are,
[01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:19.100]  but it's, you know, effectively you get 50 bucks
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.340]  on any regular mattress.
[01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.180]  It's a great deal.
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:23.060]  So my thanks to Casper.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:23.900]  All right, Apple watch.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.380]  I think this is another one.
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:28.100]  Why aren't there more rumors about this?
[01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.780]  I think that there's going to be a brand new Apple watch.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.980]  And I think it's, I've heard, I heard from one little birdie
[01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:38.700]  who does not work at Apple and won't say anything else
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:40.980]  about how this person claims to have known this,
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:44.900]  but so it's, you know, let's file this under sketchy
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:48.340]  and not somebody who I would bet on,
[01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.460]  somebody I'd never heard of before,
[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:51.260]  but someone who just happened upon this information
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.940]  says that it looks, you know, you can tell,
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.860]  anybody who knows what an Apple watch looks like
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:57.740]  can tell at a glance that the new one is different.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.900]  I would guess they didn't say anything to me
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.420]  about exactly what that means,
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.940]  what way that it's different.
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.060]  My guess would be that it looks basically
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.140]  like an Apple watch, but maybe it's like thinner.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.940]  Cause I think that's the one way that Apple watch
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:11.260]  could definitely improve is by getting thinner.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.300]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:18.060]  And you know, what we don't know about Apple watch
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:22.060]  is the sensors and everything that,
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:24.940]  that they're working on in there.
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:28.660]  And, you know, so there's definitely a lot of room
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.540]  for Apple to move.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.420]  Yeah, and there are rumors,
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.460]  the rumors that have been out
[01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.140]  are that they are going to have some models
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.620]  with cellular networking, independent cellular networking,
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.980]  so that, and I can see, and that's the sort of thing
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.420]  that you know exactly how that leaked.
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.180]  It leaked from the fucking carriers, right?
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:50.460]  It's, you know, it's sort of like how
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:54.100]  when Apple's TV deals leak, you know,
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:57.140]  then it's, remember that story about Eddy Q
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:01.620]  going in to meet with HBO and showed up with jeans
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.660]  and like sandals or something.
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.180]  And a Hawaiian shirt or something.
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.380]  Yeah, and it's like, well, geez,
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.380]  I wonder who leaked that story.
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.500]  Was it Eddy Q or was it the people complaining
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.300]  about the way Eddy was dressed?
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.020]  Yeah. Pretty obvious who leaked that.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.460]  Well, you know, that this Apple watch
[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:19.020]  with cellular networking leaked from the carriers.
[01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.900]  My guess is that's probably what
[01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.100]  that they're going to announce that.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.340]  I, you know, this is what Apple does is they make,
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:29.180]  you know, the first product is the hardest one to make.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.420]  So like the first Apple watch, you know, was late
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:35.700]  and it was, remember when it first shipped,
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:40.140]  it was, I mean, I think that they really wanted
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:43.820]  to ship it the holiday quarter before it actually came out.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.940]  And you know, it was eight months later than that
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:48.380]  when it actually started shipping.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.460]  In the first few months, it was really hard to get.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.860]  It was, they were all sold out and back ordered.
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.460]  Because it's hard, the first product is hard.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:56.500]  But then what does Apple do after that?
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.220]  Is they every year release a new version
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:02.060]  with a year's worth of, you know, subtle improvements,
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:03.640]  subtle or not so subtle improvements
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.980]  or additional sensors, additional networking.
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.440]  So I'd be a little surprised
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.260]  if there's not a new Apple watch next week.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:12.760]  I really would.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.860]  Now, you know, there's,
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:19.180]  you look at the navigation of the Apple watch.
[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:23.580]  Do you use your watch much?
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.420]  In between.
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:27.020]  It's one of, you know, I do wear,
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:29.380]  I wear it a lot when I know I'm gonna be working all day
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.060]  because I really love the unlocking of the Mac
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.740]  with the Apple watch.
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.860]  Yeah, me too.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:37.100]  But I hardly use that, you know,
[01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.580]  the circular type navigation with the icons.
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:41.740]  It's cool. Oh, never.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.580]  Yeah, I never use it.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.540]  But I, you know, I'm just never there.
[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.900]  I think it's a design mistake.
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.620]  I don't think, actually, they kind of-
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:51.820]  I don't know if it was a mistake.
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.220]  I do, I think it was a mistake.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:55.620]  I think it's a bad, I think it's a bad UI.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.980]  And I think that they,
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.940]  I think that's why the watchOS 4 has a new list view
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.660]  for apps where you can change the view
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:06.260]  from that round honeycomb to just a scrolling list.
[01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:09.180]  And I think that's a much better interface.
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.420]  Bigger tap targets and just a list, you know.
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:14.980]  I never know where the hell my apps are in that honeycomb.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:15.820]  It looks cool.
[01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:16.640]  Well, yeah, there's that.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.300]  It looks cool and the animation is cool,
[01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.860]  but it's, to me, it's just not usable.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:23.620]  I mean, and not like it's unusable,
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.620]  but it's, you know, the usability is poor, I would say.
[01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:33.700]  But from a design and, you know, effects standpoint,
[01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.660]  it is a typical Apple type thing.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.820]  I think it's atypical because it's so,
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:41.560]  it's too confusing, I think.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.400]  I don't know.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.780]  But I think that switching to a list.
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:46.860]  Just from design, not usability.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:48.180]  Leave usability.
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:52.380]  But I'm saying when you scroll around with it, it's cool.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.460]  It's got that nice, you know, magnifying effect.
[01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.580]  And that part is good.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:00.120]  I think the reason why they've gotten away
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:02.740]  with a poor design for that screen
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.440]  is that most people don't need it anyway.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.040]  You just don't need to launch apps on your phone.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:08.700]  I mean, I don't know, I mean.
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.540]  That's true.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.180]  And I think, you know, it's no secret.
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.220]  I think Apple was upfront about it,
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:15.580]  especially with watchOS 3 last year,
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.460]  that hey, we've really narrowed down
[01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:18.940]  what this device is good for.
[01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:20.180]  It's good for notifications
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.960]  and it's good for fitness tracking.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.840]  Yep.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.280]  And they, you know, focused the OS on that
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.580]  and I think that they will continue to,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.140]  you know, whatever is new in the hardware
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.700]  will be focused on that.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.340]  I mean, there was a story, who was it?
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:37.460]  Men's Health had earlier this week
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.480]  where they got to go behind the scenes
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:44.480]  in Apple's secret fitness lab where they had these
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.820]  freaky looking blue masks on the people exercising.
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:49.660]  They said they cost like $4,000 each,
[01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:52.100]  but they like can measure like the exact
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.100]  like input and output of the oxygen
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.060]  and stuff like that that you're, you know.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:33:01.060]  And I just don't think Apple would pitch an exclusive,
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:03.780]  hey, we'll give you a behind the scenes,
[01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.260]  look at the secret lab.
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.940]  I don't think that they would do that
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:10.660]  at the end of August or early September
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:13.480]  if they weren't doing it to sort of ramp up excitement
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.740]  of fitness tracking with Apple Watch
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.060]  because there's gonna be a new Apple Watch.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:23.060]  Now, I haven't installed the new betas of watchOS,
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:26.260]  but I understand that there's some new types
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.900]  of fitness tracking in there.
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:32.380]  Yeah, and somebody, I forget where the,
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:35.740]  like one of the new iOS betas, somebody like,
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:37.580]  it was, you know, those spelunkers,
[01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.780]  you know, the who can go through and find stuff.
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.260]  They found evidence, but they did,
[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.860]  they found evidence of like as yet
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.900]  unannounced exercises that you can do.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.500]  I mean, that's exactly, you know,
[01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:48.860]  so part of that is the OS,
[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:52.500]  but I think that if they can either improve the sensors
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.000]  that already has or add additional sensors,
[01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.620]  it's exactly what I would expect from Apple.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.860]  I mean, the one that would be the huge one,
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:03.500]  I don't think we'll get it this year, but who knows?
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:08.420]  But the big one is the blood sugar monitoring, right?
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:10.980]  So that people with diabetes can,
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:16.420]  it would just be, the life-changing aspect of that
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.740]  is almost indescribable.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:19.840]  I mean, I'm lucky, I don't have diabetes,
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.620]  or nobody in my immediate family does,
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.180]  but it's a common enough disease
[01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:25.100]  that everybody knows somebody who has diabetes.
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.100]  Correct, yeah.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:30.580]  And I know a couple of people who have kids with diabetes,
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:33.180]  and it's just, it's bad for everybody.
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:34.340]  It's not a good disease.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:35.980]  It's, you know, it's bad,
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.740]  but it's just like almost heartbreaking
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:38.840]  when somebody's kid has it,
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.300]  and every day, you know, they're pricking their finger.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.220]  I mean, it's bad enough when you're an adult,
[01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:46.220]  but, you know, try telling like a six-year-old kid
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:48.300]  that you gotta, you know, prick your finger every day.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.440]  So if you could change that
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:52.660]  and have non-invasive blood sugar monitoring,
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:56.280]  man, that would almost steal the show, really.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.120]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.620]  I don't think we're getting that this year, though.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.260]  It just seems too, you know, too far.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.020]  I don't know, I'm too much of a pessimist
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.460]  to think that we'd be lucky enough to get that this year.
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:09.940]  Yeah, I mean, they have to be so careful with this stuff
[01:35:09.940 --> 01:35:12.700]  because people rely on it, and it doesn't work.
[01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.380]  You know, you can't say that you have
[01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.140]  blood sugar monitoring, and then,
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:21.900]  ah, you know, it works 50% of the time, sort of, you know.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.740]  Yeah.
[01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:25.620]  I wonder, too, if they would,
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.320]  if when they introduced that,
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.420]  because of all of the regulatory stuff
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:32.760]  that they would have to go through to get it approved,
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.860]  I wonder if they would do something
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:38.780]  sort of like how, when they preannounced the watch itself,
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.840]  that, you know, seven months,
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:42.420]  eight months before it actually shipped,
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:45.540]  they could do that because they weren't hurting their,
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.540]  there's some things that Apple can preannounce,
[01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:49.300]  like if it's a new product that they already,
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.340]  they're not hurting the sales of their existing ones,
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:53.180]  they can do it, like, with the watch.
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.500]  I wonder if they could do something like, say,
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.900]  we've got a blood, we've got a new sensor
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.340]  that can monitor blood sugar,
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.600]  but it's, right now, it's, you know,
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.340]  it's not approved, so it's not enabled in the OS,
[01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:07.020]  but we're going to go, you know,
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:08.760]  you could buy it, and we're gonna work
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:12.540]  with the regulatory people and enable this in the future
[01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.500]  once it meets all the stuff.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.500]  You know, announce it first, then get it approved,
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.540]  and then, you know, ship a software update
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.480]  that turns it on.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.320]  I don't know.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.300]  I don't know if they would do that or not.
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:26.180]  I don't know if that's too much like promising,
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.700]  you know, because they can't guarantee
[01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:28.980]  when that's going to be available.
[01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:32.160]  Can you sell somebody, can you have people buy the watch now
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:33.820]  on the assumption that it's gonna get approved
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:35.740]  when you can't really guarantee
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.860]  that it's going to get approved?
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:38.040]  What if it doesn't?
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.420]  So maybe not.
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:42.380]  I don't know how all of that stuff would work.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:44.400]  Magic stuff.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.900]  I think they'll announce whatever they have
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:50.260]  at the show, you know, at the event.
[01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:52.140]  It's just all gonna be there,
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.720]  but how they turn it all on and everything.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.740]  Yeah, but I definitely would expect that there'll be,
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.820]  you know, maybe not blood sugar monitor,
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:37:00.260]  but new sensors, more accurate sensors.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.900]  You know, there's all sorts of stuff they can do,
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.800]  and I think that they are laser focused
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.400]  on that fitness tracking and notifications angle.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.260]  The notifications thing is certainly,
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.340]  that would be a big part of why you would want
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:13.420]  to add cellular networking, right?
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.260]  Yep.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:16.340]  And the mystery to me is how are they gonna sell that?
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.340]  You know, is it, you know, like with an iPad,
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.320]  when you get cellular networking,
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.020]  you pay, you know, 50 bucks a month or whatever,
[01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:28.820]  you know, or 25 for less data or whatever.
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.740]  It's completely independent of your cell phone, right?
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.920]  It's, you can have a different carrier.
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.140]  You can, you know, which is actually what I like to do
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.780]  is, you know, my phone's on Verizon.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:42.020]  I like to have an iPad with AT&T cellular
[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.440]  so that when I'm in a hotel or something,
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.380]  if I want to, you know, tether,
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.460]  use it for tethering my Mac to get networking,
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.680]  instead of using hotel wifi,
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.360]  I've got double the chances of getting a strong signal
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.440]  because I've got two networks.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.500]  But anyway, it's a totally separate device,
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.460]  totally separate billing.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:59.020]  I mean, you can add a device
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.140]  like in our Verizon family plan.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:05.060]  We can add an iPad if we want and have it in the same bill,
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.340]  but you don't have to.
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:09.220]  Like, how will it work with a watch?
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.400]  Like, I don't, you know, like nobody's gonna,
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.240]  almost nobody is.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:13.180]  I think it's gonna be the same thing.
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.780]  But I don't want, I don't know though.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:18.260]  I kind of feel like you'd kind of want it somehow paired
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.540]  with your phone somehow because like,
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:22.400]  if you got like a text message to your phone,
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.240]  wouldn't you want,
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:24.620]  you wouldn't want to have a separate phone number
[01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:25.460]  for your watch, right?
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.280]  No, no, no.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.220]  I'm saying it would be on the same type of network.
[01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:30.060]  Oh, I see.
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.880]  Right, right. Yeah.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:36.880]  Yeah, so that you can go out and still receive a call.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:41.100]  You know, is that gonna be part of it?
[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.300]  You know, you have your AirPods on
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:47.140]  and you're out for a walk and a call comes
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.260]  and you don't have your phone,
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:50.380]  but you still have your watch.
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.220]  Right.
[01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:53.740]  And then how much data will you be able to use, you know?
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.140]  And it certainly, you know,
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.780]  the watch has never had a lot of storage
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.540]  and it's always been hard to get stuff to it.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.980]  I mean, like I've tried using,
[01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:02.940]  like Marco Armand has gone into detail about it,
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:03.780]  but I think he pulled,
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:06.060]  he even pulled the feature from Overcast
[01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.980]  where he had spent all this time on a version
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:12.300]  to get it to play audio independently on the watch.
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.580]  So you could go away from the phone
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.780]  and still listen to your podcast.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:18.100]  And it was so problematic in so many ways
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:19.140]  that he had to pull the feature.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:20.700]  I mean, it's a hassle,
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.540]  but for like streaming audio,
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:24.380]  and that's obviously what Apple's interested in
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:25.760]  with Apple Music, you know,
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.500]  cellular networking is easily good enough
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.820]  so you don't have to worry about transferring
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.060]  and storing stuff on the watch.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:35.140]  You could just go out, connect your AirPods
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:36.820]  and stream the music.
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:37.640]  Yeah.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.080]  I mean, I probably, I don't think I would buy one.
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.500]  I don't think I wear a watch enough
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.900]  that I would want the cellular one,
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.100]  but I could see why some people would.
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.260]  I wear a watch every, I wear the watch every day.
[01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:53.260]  So I would get, I would get so, I would.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:56.620]  It's, you know, and again,
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.180]  it certainly plays right into the notifications thing.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.180]  And if you, you know, work in some kind of context
[01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:04.700]  where you can't take your phone out easily,
[01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:08.060]  being able to get your notifications on your wrist
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.400]  would be fantastic.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:15.660]  Well, my watch allowed me to use my phone differently,
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:18.300]  you know, cause, cause I get those notifications.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:23.300]  So while, while we were just talking there, somebody texted,
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.300]  you know, I don't have to pick up my phone.
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:28.500]  I just look at my watch and I saw who it was and said, okay,
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.900]  I don't need to worry about that right now.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:35.420]  So, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll call, I'll call Tim back.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:38.260]  You know, that's, that's no problem.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:39.860]  Yeah. So anyway, I do think we will get,
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:41.580]  I think we'll see new, new watches.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.900]  Here's the big question I always get
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:44.100]  when I talk about new watches.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.700]  The question I always get when I talk about new watch
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:50.300]  hardware is do I think that they will be strap compatible
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.000]  with the existing Apple watch straps?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:53.940]  I have no idea.
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:56.980]  I don't know the little birdie who told me that there's,
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.220]  it's going to be some kind of visual, you know,
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.540]  form factor change to it.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:02.900]  I said nothing about it.
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:04.220]  I would hope so.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.000]  I would definitely hope so.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:07.980]  I would hope so too,
[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:12.140]  but that's kind of like having everything on a new iPhone
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:14.180]  line up with the old case.
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.420]  Well, but I think on the watch, it's a little different.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:19.120]  You know, if you really, if you'd really like take,
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.740]  I've looked at it and thought about it.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.300]  And, and I think the things that might change, you know,
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.620]  like they could change like the, the bezel around,
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.700]  you know, have the display maybe go closer to edge to edge,
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.740]  you know, they could do all sorts of stuff like that.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:35.980]  And it, if you look at the, where those,
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:39.860]  those channels are for where you slide the bands in,
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.460]  I could see the watch, you know,
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.020]  I could see a fair amount of flexibility in their ability to
[01:41:44.020 --> 01:41:44.860]  make a new,
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:48.620]  a new looking watch that would still have the same channels
[01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.100]  for those straps.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:51.940]  And, you know,
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:54.140]  certainly people who've put a lot of money into their strap
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.920]  collection would want that.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.280]  So I would think, I would think if it's not strap
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:01.780]  compatible, it's because they've come up with something so
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:05.140]  much better that it was worth disappointing people for it.
[01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:08.100]  Yeah. And I think that they'll do what they can to,
[01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:10.100]  to make sure that it is strapped compatible.
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:10.980]  I mean, like you said,
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:15.660]  there's a lot that they probably can change, you know,
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:18.220]  thickness or whatever it's going to be,
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:23.220]  but it'll probably be the same size, you know, edge to edge.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.940]  I it's sort of like with the connectors, you know,
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:28.500]  like where they, the, they, they got so much, I mean,
[01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:30.340]  I don't think it would be anywhere nearly as controversial
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.100]  if they, if they do have a new
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.000]  or incompatible strap connector,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.360]  it's not going to be as contentious as it was when Apple
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.460]  switched from the 30 pin to lightning.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.700]  But I think the same sentiment is still there,
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:46.420]  that Apple doesn't make changes like that lightly.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:47.860]  It's not like every two years,
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:50.140]  there's a new phone connector, you know,
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:52.420]  they realize that having your, you know,
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:56.160]  having that work with device after device, you know,
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.700]  year after year is a feature, you know?
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:01.660]  And so I think that if they can keep it strap compatible,
[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:02.500]  they would, I,
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.700]  cause I think they also realize like this isn't the sort of
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.180]  thing where somebody who already has four straps,
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.500]  if they got the new watch is going to immediately replace
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:10.420]  all four straps,
[01:43:10.420 --> 01:43:13.100]  and they're going to make money on it by selling additional
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:13.940]  straps.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:17.060]  Well, and that people have accused Apple of that before too.
[01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:20.340]  Well, they just want to sell adapters and no, they don't,
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:22.620]  you know, they, they make those decisions for different
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:27.620]  reasons than to sell a $10 adapter or $20 adapter.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.840]  Well, I do think I agree with that,
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.820]  but that's why I think it was a mistake for Apple to price
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:36.180]  the 30 pin to lightning adapter at whatever the cost was.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:38.180]  It was like either 19 or $29.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.020]  I forget what it was,
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:40.820]  but whatever it was, it was too much.
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:42.440]  They should have sold them for like 10 bucks.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:43.280]  Yeah.
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:44.120]  Yeah.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:44.940]  I know.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:45.780]  I think part of it,
[01:43:45.780 --> 01:43:47.660]  I think the reason they did wasn't to make money,
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:50.020]  but because they just don't like selling things for less
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.080]  than $20, you know, they really don't.
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:53.920]  I mean,
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.760]  yeah.
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.180]  And they, they even,
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.320]  and I think they realized that with the headphone jack thing
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.080]  last year, where they even said like the,
[01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.580]  that that's the,
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:04.500]  the lightning,
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:08.940]  the replacement lightning to traditional headphone jack
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.580]  dinguses,
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:12.780]  they even said it's the least expensive thing they've ever
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:14.380]  sold in an Apple store.
[01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:15.200]  Wow.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.040]  Cause they really,
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:16.880]  really,
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:18.420]  really just had no interest in making,
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:19.940]  making money by selling.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:20.780]  No.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.620]  No.
[01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.440]  All right.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.280]  Let me take one last break here.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:24.120]  I got to thank our,
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.940]  our last sponsor of the show and it's our good friends.
[01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:27.940]  You know, them fracture fractures,
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:30.260]  the photo decor company that's out to rescue your favorite
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.220]  images from the digital ether.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:35.340]  Look, all your pictures are like on Instagram or Facebook,
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.860]  you know, they're in your photo roll.
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:38.820]  That's where most of, you know,
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.540]  they always are is in the photo roll on your,
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.420]  on your phone.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.100]  That's great.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.860]  Digital photography is fantastic.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.620]  It's the best way to share your pictures.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.460]  Of course.
[01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:50.280]  I mean, you know,
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.460]  nobody's printing out photos on paper and then mailing them
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:53.280]  to relatives.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:54.880]  You just text them the picture, right?
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.560]  But what about your best pictures?
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.380]  Get them printed and hang them up in your house.
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:02.500]  Cause what better to put on the walls of your house than the
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.380]  pictures of your friends, family,
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:06.620]  and loved ones or places that you've been
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:10.140]  and fracture makes it so easy.
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:12.660]  And the pictures are beautiful.
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:14.340]  I say, it looks like art gallery prints.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.180]  They are so good.
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.180]  It's a frameless design and they print the photo directly on
[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:19.020]  the glass.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.780]  It's not like they print it on a piece of paper and then glue
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.860]  it to the glass.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:26.020]  They've got some kind of custom crazy apparatus where they
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:28.700]  literally print directly on glass,
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:31.860]  completely edge to edge with absolutely no bezel around the
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:33.260]  side sides.
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:36.380]  And they ship them to you with everything you need to either
[01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.940]  hang them on the wall or prop them up on a,
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.060]  on a mantle or your desk or something like that.
[01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.100]  You don't need anything else.
[01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:46.380]  So it's not like you get your fracture printed and then you
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.240]  go buy a frame to hang it or something like that.
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:51.280]  It's all included.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.340]  Every picture you get from them comes with what they call a
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:55.400]  60 day happiness guarantee.
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.540]  So you get 60 days.
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:58.980]  If you're not happy with it, you get a full refund.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.940]  And every single fracture is handmade in Gainesville,
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:05.260]  Florida from us source materials in a carbon neutral
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:06.100]  factory.
[01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:09.660]  For more information and 10% off your first order,
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:14.660]  go to fracture me.com slash podcast.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.680]  Don't forget to mention the talk show in there.
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.520]  One question survey.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:21.700]  The one question is where did you hear about fracture?
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.300]  That's that's where you let them know.
[01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.360]  And that's how you can help support this show.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.220]  That's fracture me.com slash podcast.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:29.720]  Go get your pictures printed.
[01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.540]  All right. What else do we,
[01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:34.300]  what else do we think might be happening in this event?
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:37.100]  Well, there, there's not going to be any max
[01:46:37.100 --> 01:46:40.660]  and there's not going to be any iPod or iPads.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.580]  iPads are done for the year.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:46.980]  The only thing really left.
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:49.620]  And, and to me, there's a bigger question than this,
[01:46:49.620 --> 01:46:51.940]  than the piece of hardware.
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:55.020]  But the only thing really left is the Apple TV.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:59.540]  Well, there's there, there could be some stuff with iOS,
[01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:02.280]  like things that we don't know yet about iOS 11,
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.820]  because it seems like they're going to switch the
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:05.780]  multitasking to go from the bottom.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:09.500]  And you know how they got, they too much complaint
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.740]  with starting with the first beta of iOS 11,
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:13.940]  they got rid of the thing where you could force touch
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:16.580]  on the left side of the screen to enter multitasking,
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.100]  which again, I think is a change
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.420]  that they did not undertake lately because there's,
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.080]  I know a lot of people who use that feature.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.560]  I never really got into that.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.780]  I was always, I've always been a double click
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.820]  on the home button to multitask,
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.180]  but that seems like that could change.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:34.020]  So I feel like there will be a fair amount
[01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.260]  of iOS demo time, you know, on stage.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:42.260]  To be clear at this event and every September event,
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:47.660]  I always, I think iOS and Mac OS demos or news is a given
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.140]  because there'll be released shortly.
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:59.900]  So to me, that's an iPhone at this event is a given
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:03.820]  and iOS demos also a given.
[01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:07.100]  Yep, so yeah, Apple TV.
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.100]  I think that we, I will predict yes,
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.160]  Apple TV will have new hardware with 4K support.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:16.420]  Hopefully, oh my God, please.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:17.540]  Do you know how I said I don't clap?
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:20.300]  I will clap for this one if it comes with a new remote.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:23.180]  You don't like the remote?
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:29.540]  No, well, I don't hate it as much as some people do,
[01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.260]  but it's my most used remote.
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:34.020]  Almost everything I watch on TV now is on Apple TV.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:36.320]  I almost, and when I'm not,
[01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.220]  if I'm not watching Apple TV, it's TiVo
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:43.340]  and TiVo stuff is stuff I watch with Amy
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.340]  and she doesn't let me use the remote.
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:49:00.220]  Oh my God, I love Amy. She thinks I'm way too slow on the trigger on commercials, especially if the commercial comes on
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:04.580]  and it's a good commercial, I'll just watch it because I don't really hate commercials,
[01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:10.540]  but she hates commercials and so if I've got the TiVo remote and we get five seconds into a commercial,
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:12.380]  she's like, give me that.
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.740]  So I don't really use it.
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:19.220]  So I use the Apple TV remote almost all the time when I'm watching TV and it is not a great remote.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:21.420]  It is flawed in a couple of ways.
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:29.940]  So do you have one of these services like Hulu Live or YouTube or DirecTV Now or whatever?
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.980]  Where you watch live TV on Apple TV?
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:35.820]  No, no, we've got real, no, we've just got traditional cable.
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:37.740]  That's why we have a TiVo.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.820]  Have you ever tried one of those?
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:48.580]  I almost did because when we moved earlier in the year, I almost did because we got internet service working,
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.780]  but couldn't get, it's such a pain in the ass with TiVo.
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:53.540]  You have to get these cable card things.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:59.140]  They look like an old, those old cards you used to have to put in a,
[01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:02.420]  remember those things you'd put in a power book to get additional ports?
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.300]  Like what were they called?
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:06.860]  Or they had one for wireless networking.
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:08.980]  Remember it stuck over the side?
[01:50:08.980 --> 01:50:12.020]  That's how you got Wi-Fi is, what were those called?
[01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:13.340]  This is why we need a chat room.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.980]  Were they called Nubus cards or was that something?
[01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:21.300]  I don't know, they were huge and they slid halfway into the computer.
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.100]  That's what a cable card is.
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:30.180]  And it's a way, it's a thing that you get from Comcast or whoever your cable provider is
[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:34.980]  so that they can verify that you are who you say you are and that you can't,
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.940]  and once they're in you can't take them out.
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:42.700]  And it's paired with a device so I can't take my cable card out of my TiVo and go to your house
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.900]  and watch Game of Thrones through the cable card, right?
[01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:51.620]  It's a way that, some kind of anti-piracy type, but it's a huge pain in the ass.
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:55.180]  And the cable guy, it was like the third or fourth time when they came to my house
[01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.140]  when they finally got one that was working.
[01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:00.820]  And so I was on the cusp, but we had the internet working,
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.860]  so I was on the cusp of signing up for something like that.
[01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:06.180]  I was thinking about getting the Sony one, the PlayStation.
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:08.620]  Oh, PlayStation, yeah, I've heard good things about that one.
[01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.900]  Yeah, and in Philadelphia it's particularly good because it has,
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.820]  it seems like this is one of those things that varies from city to city,
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:19.540]  but in Philadelphia it has all four major broadcast networks, local affiliates.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.140]  So, but no, we don't have that.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:27.900]  We just have, we got our cable cards working and so we use TiVo to watch TV.
[01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:30.380]  I have an interesting aside on that.
[01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:33.980]  I love TiVo and TiVo recently shipped a software update.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:36.100]  It's probably the best software update they've ever had.
[01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:39.900]  They kind of refreshed their UI, still isn't a great looking UI,
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:43.820]  but it looks a lot less dated than it did.
[01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:49.180]  But the thing about TiVo is, TiVo is, never lags, never.
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:52.620]  There's never even a fraction of a second of lag on video.
[01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:56.780]  It is, Apple TV made this a lot better two years ago.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:59.900]  Like when you fast forward around in a movie or something like that
[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:02.460]  or skip to a scene, but it's nothing like TiVo.
[01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:07.260]  TiVo is like when you open like a movie on your Mac and you just stream the,
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:10.140]  you know, move the head around, you know, in QuickTime player.
[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:14.380]  Like it's perfect and you can go frame by frame
[01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:19.060]  if you really want to see something in frame by frame, slow motion.
[01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:23.140]  The remote never has any lag at all, at least for video playback.
[01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.340]  Like when you're navigating the UI, it's not perfect,
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:29.740]  but when you're doing video playback, which is the main thing TiVo can do,
[01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:31.020]  it's perfect.
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.980]  I know everybody, you know, I don't know how they're still in business,
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:37.180]  but because I know most people don't want to spend a couple hundred bucks
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:40.780]  on a DVR when they can get one for free from their cable company.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:46.300]  But it's one of the most amazing products out there that people just don't,
[01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:47.900]  most people have never even tried.
[01:52:47.900 --> 01:52:52.140]  But the main thing that sort of irritates me in the back of my head
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:55.580]  is that TiVo, I think I first got one in 2000.
[01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.660]  I remember I saw it at Rich Siegel's house,
[01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:00.460]  the founder of Barebone Software when I first started working there.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:03.260]  He invited me and Amy over for dinner and we saw it as TiVo.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:05.420]  And as soon as we saw it and saw how it worked,
[01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:08.140]  we went out the next day and bought one because it was like, oh my,
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:08.940]  like I'd heard of it.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:11.420]  And I was like, oh, you skip commercials and you can record shows or whatever.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.980]  But then once you saw it, it was like, oh my God, I need that.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:16.700]  But the thing is, it's using a computer.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:18.300]  Fundamentally, a TiVo is like a PC.
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.380]  It's using a computer to empower you, the TV owner,
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.820]  to do what you want with video.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.260]  Like you want to fast forward commercials,
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:28.460]  you fast forward commercials.
[01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:30.860]  You don't want to, you want to skip this commercial,
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:31.820]  you skip the commercial.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.260]  So it was using a computer to give me, the person who owns this
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.220]  and is watching this, more power over what I'm watching.
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:44.860]  And the way the industry has gone in the intervening 17 years
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:48.380]  is we watch more and more video on computers,
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.500]  whether they're phones or Apple TVs or rock use.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:55.660]  Almost everything now is going through a computer at some point, right?
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:54:00.220]  But what, what we as a society have allowed to happen is
[01:54:00.220 --> 01:54:04.860]  we've allowed the computers to make the commercials unskippable, right?
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.820]  Like, you know, you start watching Game of Thrones
[01:54:07.820 --> 01:54:11.580]  and you have to watch a 30 second spot for some other show.
[01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.340]  Or when you are on Hulu and you're watching shows on Hulu,
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:17.660]  like the commercials, you can't fast forward them.
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.700]  There's, you know, they literally disabled the fast forward button.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:25.900]  Like we did that, like instead of TiVo-ing the Saturday Night Live,
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:27.020]  in the summer of Saturday Night Live,
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:30.780]  had the little 30 minute weekend updates a couple of times.
[01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:32.940]  You know, the fake news.
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.980]  And we didn't set the TiVo to record it.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:38.700]  Like that's the, you know, it sounds antiquated because the way,
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:40.300]  you know, everything's on demand now.
[01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:43.500]  And the fact that you have to tell the TiVo in advance what to record,
[01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.500]  it is old fashioned.
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.340]  It's certainly, you know, I realized that.
[01:54:47.340 --> 01:54:50.620]  But then once you have it, you're in complete control.
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:53.900]  And you can just skip the commercials and it's instantaneous
[01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.340]  and there's no penalty for it.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.540]  There's no pause.
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.860]  Whereas when we watch the Saturday Night Live on Hulu,
[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:01.740]  every commercial break, there's, you know, it's full length,
[01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:03.580]  just like watching on regular TV commercials.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.020]  And you can't skip them.
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:06.300]  Like it's maddening to me.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.420]  Yeah, that's awful.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:10.460]  We've taken the power away from the user
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:14.460]  and just given it to the shitheads who were running Hulu.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.460]  And it's worse.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.580]  The commercials are worse on these digital services than on real TV.
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:22.540]  Because on real TV, at least you don't see the same commercial twice.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.100]  Whereas everywhere where I see commercials on digital TV,
[01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:27.100]  you get the same fucking two spots.
[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.380]  You know, every time there's a commercial break,
[01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:30.460]  you see the same two goddamn commercials.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:32.140]  And it makes me crazy.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.900]  And I'm not even a totally anti-commercial person.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.380]  But I'll tell you what, when I see the same stupid jingle
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.060]  for the third time in a half hour show,
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:42.380]  I want to throw my remote through the TV.
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:44.860]  Yeah, don't do it with your Apple remote.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:45.420]  No.
[01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:49.420]  So anyway, long aside there on praising TiVo.
[01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:50.780]  I do hope they change the remote.
[01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:51.900]  I really do.
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.420]  What would you do?
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:55.740]  I would make it asymmetrical
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:55:57.900]  so that you can easily tell which way it's pointed.
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:01.500]  And anything they do after that is great.
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:06.540]  I do think they should somehow figure out a way.
[01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:10.620]  If they keep the touchpad, they should figure out a way to make it ignore,
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:13.020]  make it smarter about ignoring inadvertent touches.
[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:16.620]  I don't know if that means putting it, like, recessing it a little bit
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.380]  so it isn't really edge to edge.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:20.060]  I don't know.
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:21.420]  I'm not the product designer.
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:22.780]  I'm a product evaluator.
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:25.500]  And the current remote is problematic.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:28.780]  Fundamentally, the biggest problem to me is that it's symmetric.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.980]  And so if you pick it up, you don't know what side it is.
[01:56:31.980 --> 01:56:36.700]  I've fixed that with mine by putting a little band of gaff tape
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:41.580]  around the bottom part so that it feels different from the side.
[01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:45.180]  Every home should have at least two rolls of gaffer tape.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:47.660]  Gaffer tape is the most amazing product in the world.
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:52.140]  But most people don't know about gaff tape.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:53.660]  It's amazing.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.900]  You might think it's like duct tape,
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:58.860]  but the whole point is that you know what it is because you're a musician.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:03.500]  But it's like what gaffers use to tape microphones down,
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.180]  or lights, or something like that.
[01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:09.500]  But what makes it so great, it's this black stuff.
[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:11.020]  It's sort of like a fabric.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.820]  And it's easily ripped by hand, so you don't need scissors.
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:17.580]  And it rips straight because the fabric is sort of, I don't know,
[01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:19.340]  they somehow make it so that it rips straight.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:23.260]  It's sticky enough to hold things in place.
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:26.380]  And it's unsticky enough that when you're done, you just take it off
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:27.980]  and it doesn't leave a residue behind.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:29.900]  It's like the perfect amount of stickiness.
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:34.060]  So anyway, I took a little narrow quarter-inch band of gaff tape,
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:35.500]  wrapped it around my Apple TV remote,
[01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:38.780]  so then I can feel along the sides and I can tell which side's the front and back.
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.380]  But I feel like I shouldn't have to do that.
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:41.020]  That's ridiculous.
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:44.220]  Remote control should not be symmetric.
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:48.060]  And then secondarily, I think they got to make the touchpad
[01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:52.700]  way less likely to be inadvertently triggered.
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:57.660]  The big question, I mean, 4K seems like an obvious thing.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:00.860]  Like it's, they're actually behind the curve on that.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:04.620]  People, real people, real people have 4K.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:10.380]  Not like this is late to the game, but that it's, if it comes out this year,
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.620]  I would say it's perfectly on time for Apple.
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:15.820]  If it comes out next year, I would say they've missed it by a year.
[01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:19.580]  Like this feels like the right time for Apple TV to support 4K.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:22.780]  Is there a lot of 4K content though?
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:23.900]  There's still not a lot.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:27.420]  No, but Apple can supply their own, right?
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:30.780]  And there's rumors, you know, that they just upgrade
[01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:34.540]  all the iTunes TV shows and movies that they can to 4K.
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:37.820]  I mean, and there's rumors, somebody poking around iTunes or something.
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:42.220]  And it seems like it's, iTunes is getting ready for 4K videos.
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:43.340]  See, that would be great.
[01:58:43.340 --> 01:58:46.620]  If they could release, Apple never does anything.
[01:58:46.620 --> 01:58:49.580]  And we went through this with NFC.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:54.780]  Apple's not going to put NFC in a phone just so that they can check a box
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:57.580]  and say that they have it without a valid use for it.
[01:58:57.580 --> 01:59:01.500]  So if they're going to release a 4K Apple TV, I would have to assume
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:04.460]  that they've got some 4K content to go in there.
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:09.260]  And for them to release Planet of the Apps in 4K, not going to do it.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:14.620]  They have to release, you know, some quality shows and movies in 4K
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:16.780]  so that you can enjoy that.
[01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:17.500]  Yeah.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:21.660]  Switch it so that when you just, when you rent a new blockbuster movie,
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:23.900]  if you've got the new Apple TV, you get it in 4K.
[01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:25.500]  Right. Right.
[01:59:25.500 --> 01:59:33.260]  So the bigger question for me about Apple TV, if you remember when they did the,
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:39.740]  when they announced the new Apple TV with this new remote,
[01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:41.900]  they said, this is the future of television.
[01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:46.060]  And that was, apps are the future of television.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.220]  Yes, that was at Bill Graham.
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:48.460]  Right.
[01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:51.180]  They said that apps was the big thing.
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:56.940]  So to me, the big question with Apple TV is content.
[01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:02.700]  I mean, have we really seen a big difference?
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:07.660]  I mean, we have single sign-on and that for me, that doesn't work completely yet
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.100]  because I have Comcast.
[02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.820]  But Apple is, seems to be on a hiring spree.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:19.500]  Widely rumored to be, you know, to have a billion dollar budget for original content.
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.860]  So it's an interesting question.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:24.380]  Like, I feel like as a device, this is pretty easy to predict.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:27.580]  It'll be a look, you know, there's no reason to change the way it looks.
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:32.060]  A nice little black puck is a fine design, add 4K support,
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:36.140]  hopefully improve the remote, done.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:36.540]  Right.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:38.220]  The hardware, that's it.
[02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:40.940]  I mean, they could do more, I guess, but that's really all they need to do.
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:44.380]  It's really the content is the question.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.460]  And I almost feel like it's a confused product.
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:49.340]  Like, I'm not even sure Apple knows exactly what to do with it
[02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:55.740]  because it, you know, like Amazon's TV thing is meant to,
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:58.380]  yes, you can get Netflix and there's apps for other things.
[02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:02.140]  But the main thing is that Amazon itself has their own original content
[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:08.620]  and you can buy their device and watch the Amazon shows.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:14.060]  And, you know, like a rock you is a completely neutral device.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.900]  Rock you doesn't do any original content.
[02:01:15.900 --> 02:01:19.580]  They just have apps for everything and, you know, developer APIs
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:21.900]  and people seem, and they keep the price very low.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:26.540]  It seems like, you know, that's sort of like a, one of the few,
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:29.740]  I can't think of, it's very hard to think of a company like rock you
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:32.620]  that's having as much success as they are against, you know,
[02:01:32.620 --> 02:01:34.540]  these big companies like Apple and Amazon.
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:38.380]  Like it's a tale of a little independent hardware company
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:39.820]  that's doing very well.
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:42.540]  And part of why they're doing well is that they're sort of like Switzerland, right?
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.820]  They're like completely neutral.
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:49.340]  Like they don't favor, you know, Amazon over Netflix.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.740]  It's all, they're just completely neutral, right?
[02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:55.820]  So is Apple TV supposed to be like that where everybody is equal?
[02:01:56.540 --> 02:02:00.780]  It never really has been because even though Apple doesn't have original content,
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:05.340]  they've always sold and rented their own movies and TV shows.
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:08.540]  You know, not their two movies and TV shows, but that's it.
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:12.780]  It's like you pay Apple and iTunes to rent, you know, Wonder Woman.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:19.020]  But I think that they become more equal in recent years as you search for things
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.900]  and it brings up, oh, do you want to watch that for free on Netflix
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:22.940]  or would you like to buy it?
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:27.260]  So I think that the equalization is starting to happen.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:27.500]  Right.
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.820]  But what, at what point if Apple makes this push into original content
[02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:37.340]  and that there are TV shows and or movies that are only available through iTunes
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:41.980]  or Apple music or whatever, whatever way they would have it, you know,
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:44.540]  right now you get these, their original content through Apple music.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:52.060]  At what point does that mean that they're competing with Netflix
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:55.660]  as opposed to a partner with Netflix where Netflix gets a first class,
[02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:58.620]  you know, is a first class experience on Apple TV?
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:03:01.740]  I don't think that's, that would be in question, would it?
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:05.660]  I mean, I don't think, I don't know though, you know, and it's different,
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.140]  you know what I mean?
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.180]  What is the point of Apple TV?
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:15.420]  Is it to be the best TV experience for any and all TV or is it meant primarily
[02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:16.620]  for Apple's own content?
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.300]  I don't think it's necessarily in conflict.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:24.140]  I think that there's a way that they can do this, but to me it's,
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:28.620]  it's a more confusing product right now than it was when it first came out originally,
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.140]  you know, back in the old days.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:34.860]  It was really just sort of like, this is a way to rent TV shows and movies from iTunes.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:45.260]  Yeah, I don't think any content that Apple gets into is going to affect its partnerships
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:48.860]  with Amazon or Netflix or anything else.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:53.900]  I think they're all going to be, I mean, Apple realizes that we want access to all of it.
[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:58.300]  If we can't get access to all of it on an Apple TV, we'll go somewhere else.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:02.140]  Yeah, I do think they get that because the holy grail is to be,
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:06.860]  I think I'm stealing a line from John Siracusa here, but you want to be HDMI one, right?
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:13.260]  You want to be the device that gets plugged into the first HDMI, you know,
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:17.820]  the one when you first turn your TV on, you want it to be that you don't have to switch
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:22.620]  the inputs to get to that device, you know, the holy grail is to, and to keep you there
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:27.100]  for as much of your TV watching as possible because switching, once you have to switch,
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.340]  it's, it always is, this sucks.
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:31.900]  I agree.
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:37.340]  So Apple has $1 billion to go towards content.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:47.740]  Now, just for comparison, Netflix spends $5 to $6 billion in original content.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:56.300]  So, you know, when you first look and when we first heard of Apple's $1 billion content budget,
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:58.940]  you think, holy crap, that's a lot of money.
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:04.460]  But in actual fact, it's not, not in comparison to what others are doing.
[02:05:05.260 --> 02:05:09.660]  So, and the thing I read was, and it makes a lot of sense to me, was that when Netflix
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:14.780]  first got into original content, it was with like a billion dollar a year budget.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:16.460]  And it was the same with Amazon.
[02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:20.940]  When Amazon first got into it, it was about, and it's not so much how much money do you
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:26.860]  have as a company, it's that practically speaking, you can't really spend more than a billion
[02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:28.940]  dollars when you're first getting into it.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:34.780]  You know, and part of the reason that you can spend more in years down the road is that
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:38.060]  part of that money is going to the shows you've already got, right?
[02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:44.220]  It's, you know, like season two of Stranger Things is part of that $5 to $6 billion that
[02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:45.420]  Netflix is spending.
[02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:50.300]  Whereas Apple's obviously would all be, you know, the first year of every series.
[02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:52.620]  I guess that's the point.
[02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:58.060]  It's not Apple TV itself, but this push into original content that sort of, to me, what
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:05:59.260]  is Apple's goal in this?
[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:05.260]  Is it to be the best, provide the best experience for other, any and all content makers, or
[02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:08.380]  is it to present their own original content?
[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:09.500]  I think it's both.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:11.100]  I really do think it's both.
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:17.580]  I don't think that Apple is going to punish other content makers because they have original
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:18.700]  content now.
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:22.940]  I think that they're going to put it all out there and everybody's going to get an app
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:26.540]  and, you know, let the user decide.
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:32.300]  But, you know, when it comes to content, is Apple going to like, are they going to make
[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:39.900]  shows that are great shows, like great, great shows like, you know, Ray Donovan or Breaking
[02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:43.420]  Bad or something with swearing or sex scenes or stuff like that?
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:45.500]  Or are they going to do all PG shows?
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:47.100]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:52.940]  I wrote about that, you know, because Disney, you know, back in the 80s, Disney, remember
[02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:53.900]  they had Touchstone?
[02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:55.500]  It was a wholly owned subsidiary.
[02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:56.300]  I think they got rid of it.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:59.900]  I don't think they make movies anymore, but it was like, because Disney wanted to make
[02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:02.540]  stuff that they wouldn't put under the Disney brand.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:07.740]  So they created Touchstone, which is really just a wholly owned subsidiary of Disney.
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:11.820]  And like, you know, I think Beverly Hills Cop, for example, was a Touchstone movie.
[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:14.060]  Don't ask me how I remember that.
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:14.700]  I could be wrong.
[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:17.260]  Maybe that was, might've been paramount, I might've been paramount.
[02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:21.900]  Anyway, but there were movies like Beverly Hills Cop that came out.
[02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:26.540]  And so here's a way Disney could have Eddie Murphy swearing, you know, and telling off
[02:07:26.540 --> 02:07:29.020]  color jokes without selling their brand.
[02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:33.100]  I don't know how Apple could get away with that, but you know, I could see that they
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:36.780]  just do it, you know, just have a show and just put a rating, you know, put a rating
[02:07:36.780 --> 02:07:37.980]  in front of it and that's it.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:39.740]  They certainly rent you right now.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:45.340]  They'll rent you any and all major motion pictures through, I might be, in other words,
[02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.020]  I think I might be overthinking this.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:54.860]  If iTunes will rent me, you know, R-rated movies, why wouldn't Apple's original content
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:59.500]  include R-rated, you know, TV shows?
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:01.120]  Yeah.
[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:06.700]  I mean, you can buy explicit songs, you know, on iTunes.
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:07.500]  Right.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.100]  They're just clear about labeling.
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:09.340]  Right.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.900]  The Apple way isn't not to sell you explicit songs.
[02:08:11.900 --> 02:08:14.140]  It's to make sure you're aware that it's explicit.
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:14.640]  Yeah.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.460]  I hope that they do.
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:20.300]  I hope that they don't just do like PG type shows.
[02:08:20.300 --> 02:08:26.620]  I hope that they go in and do some blockbuster shows, you know, with all these people from
[02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:27.660]  Sony that they're getting.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:32.140]  Well, did you see the rumor this week was that is that Apple is a serious bidder for
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:35.340]  the rights to James Bond franchise?
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:35.740]  Yes.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:36.620]  What do you think about that?
[02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:42.460]  Somebody wrote, I saw somebody on Twitter who seemed to, just a random retweet from
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:44.860]  somebody, but somebody who seems to know what they're talking about, like that somebody
[02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:49.660]  who follows the entertainment industry said that they think there's no chance that they
[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:55.420]  would select Apple simply because Apple, you know, they need a movie distributor and Apple
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:56.540]  has never distributed a movie.
[02:08:56.540 --> 02:09:01.100]  And so even if the money was good, the people, you know, the EON Productions who owns James
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:06.700]  Bond aren't going to want to go with an untested quantity for this.
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:12.060]  And it's Apple probably knows this and that they're bidding just to, it's a signal to
[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:13.500]  Hollywood that they're serious.
[02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:14.300]  I don't know though.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:17.100]  It seems to me like Apple isn't one to make token gestures.
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:22.460]  I think if they're bidding, if they're bidding, they're serious and maybe they would just
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:26.140]  partner with an existing studio to get the, you know, to get their feet wet.
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:28.860]  Anyway, I think it would be fantastic and I can totally see it.
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:32.300]  I think they're exactly right, like with the way, and I know some people roll their eyes
[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:38.140]  at this, the so-called extended universes thing, you know, like with Marvel and DC and
[02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:42.940]  Star Wars, of course now, you know, it's becoming this, you know, bigger, you know, something
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:47.100]  with, you know, TV shows and with, you know, multiple spin-offs and movies and stuff.
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.180]  I could totally see that working with James Bond.
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:50.460]  I think it would be fantastic.
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.460]  Maybe I could be the next Bond.
[02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.060]  I could see that, yeah.
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:59.020]  I could see that, yeah.
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.380]  You have lost weight.
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:02.940]  Yeah, you know, I'm a handsome guy.
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:05.100]  There's no denying that.
[02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:06.620]  I will say this.
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:11.980]  I think a lot of people underestimate Apple's potential in, on a lot of podcasts I listen
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:17.580]  to, it seems to me like the consensus is basically Apple totally is inept and sucks at original
[02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:23.420]  content because the first two examples we have, Planet of the Apps and the Carpool Karaoke
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:24.860]  are not good.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:27.900]  Although I haven't watched the Carpool Karaoke yet.
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:32.860]  I did watch Planet of the Apps and it was, I had trouble getting through the first episode.
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:34.460]  Just boring.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:41.340]  But I don't see any reason, I think these just happen to be the first shows.
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:46.540]  I don't think it's indicative of anything, you know, of their big plans, right?
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:48.220]  Like what was Netflix's first show?
[02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:49.660]  Nobody even fucking remembers, right?
[02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:50.380]  I don't know.
[02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:54.460]  You know, like that's why I say Apple's making a big push.
[02:10:54.460 --> 02:11:01.420]  They're hiring these Sony execs that are great at making content and they're getting
[02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.060]  them in there.
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.060]  And that's exactly what they need.
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:08.460]  They don't need original content done by Jimmy Iovine.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:13.820]  They need original content done by TV guys that have been in the business for a long
[02:11:13.820 --> 02:11:15.660]  time and know what the hell they're doing.
[02:11:15.660 --> 02:11:20.540]  And they go out and make a Breaking Bad or something that's just going to go way over
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:20.860]  the top.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:25.340]  And I have no doubt in the next couple of years, Apple's going to have a big hit.
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:27.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:31.020]  And it's, you know, they suck at original content and only until they don't.
[02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:37.980]  And I don't think that the existing shows are any indication of what it could or what
[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:38.780]  they intended to be.
[02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:40.220]  They just happen to be first.
[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:41.740]  I think the more interesting thing is why?
[02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:42.460]  Why are they doing this?
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.100]  Do they feel they have to or is it just something they want to do?
[02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:49.100]  And I think they don't have to do it.
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.420]  I don't think there's any reason that they have to do this.
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:58.700]  I think they want to do it because they want that services number to go up.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:11:59.740]  And it is going up.
[02:11:59.740 --> 02:12:05.340]  And one way to get that services number up is get more and more people to subscribe to
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.700]  a $20 a month service.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:07.980]  I mean, what does Apple Music cost?
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:08.940]  Is it $20 a month?
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:11.500]  No, $10 a month.
[02:12:11.500 --> 02:12:12.300]  $10 a month.
[02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:19.740]  You know, a side question on that is, well, right now their original content is part of
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:22.140]  Apple Music as you pay for Apple Music.
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:25.340]  And if you do pay for Apple Music, then you can watch their shows.
[02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:27.900]  Will that stay the same?
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.900]  I mean, one reason, you know, or are they going to have a separate Apple TV service?
[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:34.700]  Like you could pay for Apple Music and you pay $10 a month to get music.
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:38.140]  You pay $10 for Apple TV and you can watch Apple's TV and movies.
[02:12:39.020 --> 02:12:39.660]  I don't think so.
[02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:42.620]  I think it makes a lot more sense that it would be one subscription.
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:45.580]  Yeah, they don't want to have too many subscriptions hanging around.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:49.900]  I think that they realize that it's so hard to get people to pay for one thing.
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.300]  It just doesn't make sense to have them pay more.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:54.800]  Yeah.
[02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:58.300]  Or to try to get them to pay for a separate thing.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:02.300]  My question would be if they keep it under Apple Music, do they keep the name Apple Music?
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:03.440]  Yeah.
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:07.420]  It would be funny because it would be exactly like iTunes, right?
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:12.220]  iTunes is a name that says, oh, this is about music because it says tunes.
[02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:17.820]  And over the years it became, you know, this is how you, this is how you,
[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:20.060]  it's how you restore your iPhone.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:22.560]  Right?
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:24.720]  Yeah.
[02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.860]  Like from when did iTunes come out?
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:28.540]  Like 2001 or so?
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:30.060]  Yeah, something like that, yeah.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:31.260]  Or 2000 or 2001.
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:33.660]  It was right before the iPod came out in 2001.
[02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:36.140]  So I think iTunes came out like earlier that year.
[02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:37.740]  So let's say around 2001.
[02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:44.060]  So between 2001 and just 2007, it turned into what was once just a music playing app
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:48.460]  and then became the thing you use to activate your iPhone on AT&T.
[02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:48.780]  Yeah.
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:52.540]  It would be funny to see Apple Music follow the same path where it's called music.
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:54.700]  It seems like it's pretty obvious that that's about music.
[02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:57.740]  And all of a sudden you're using it to watch movies and game shows.
[02:13:57.740 --> 02:13:58.240]  Agreed.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.380]  I agree.
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:04.060]  Anyway, do you think, so do you think, anyway, we spent all this time,
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:07.900]  we didn't say whether we think they're going to have anything to announce next week on that front.
[02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.340]  Are they going to have like...
[02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:10.780]  Yeah, they'll have something, I think.
[02:14:12.060 --> 02:14:16.140]  They did say, they even said at WWDC, they pre-announced that they've worked out a deal
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.060]  with Amazon to get Amazon to have an app on Apple TV.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:20.460]  Yes.
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.540]  Which has been a big sticking point of that.
[02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:27.820]  It's the biggest missing thing on Apple TV in terms of stuff that you can watch
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:29.980]  digitally that you can't watch on Apple TV.
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:31.980]  Amazon was the one that really stuck out.
[02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:32.540]  Yeah.
[02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:37.660]  No, I see, I put that in the category of OS updates.
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:42.380]  So iOS, watchOS, TVOS, MacOS.
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:47.100]  I think that there'll be a little something on everything, just a little update.
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.860]  Especially if they have something coming.
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:51.820]  Oh, TVOS.
[02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:55.260]  Now we have single sign-on with Comcast and that all works now.
[02:14:55.260 --> 02:14:57.820]  And just a quick mention.
[02:14:58.700 --> 02:15:01.820]  They're not going to spend 10 minutes on it, but quick mention.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.340]  And then here's the update to Apple TV and boom, gone.
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:07.420]  Everybody's going to be waiting for iPhone news.
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:09.020]  That's what we're there for.
[02:15:12.620 --> 02:15:16.460]  So do you think that they'll mention Amazon again?
[02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:17.340]  I think they probably will.
[02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:18.140]  Oh, I think they will.
[02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:19.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:19.260]  Yeah.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:21.740]  I think that's an interesting treaty.
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:23.340]  Yeah.
[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.460]  You know, that they've made peace.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.980]  Did you see the news this week that Amazon is working with Microsoft to get Alexa to
[02:15:29.980 --> 02:15:32.700]  speak to Cortana and Cortana to speak to Alexa?
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:37.180]  I thought that was interesting too, but it's like I wrote on Daring Fireball.
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:40.700]  Like this is not the right path.
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:41.180]  I don't know.
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:47.500]  Like, you know, telling, saying, verbally saying, Alexa, please open Cortana and then
[02:15:47.500 --> 02:15:49.020]  let me speak to Cortana.
[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:52.380]  And it's just not the way you're supposed to talk to these things.
[02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:54.540]  Like you're supposed to just talk naturally.
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:55.040]  Yeah.
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:57.100]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:57.740]  I agree with you.
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:59.100]  It just, I don't know.
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:01.740]  Some of the stuff is just getting weird.
[02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:10.140]  So we've got the smart, some smart lights and, you know, and smart shades, window shades.
[02:16:11.900 --> 02:16:15.420]  And right now they're hooked up to the Amazon things.
[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:19.180]  And we can talk about HomePod briefly in a moment.
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:21.900]  So we've got the main way.
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:25.020]  So we've also got little remotes to make them go up and down.
[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:26.620]  But it's nice because we have a lot of shades.
[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:31.500]  And then you can just hit a button and by pressing one button, all the shades go up
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:34.300]  at the same time and, or they all go down.
[02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:35.340]  So you don't have to sit there.
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:40.060]  It is, it's a very nice, you know, it's a first world problem walking around the house
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:42.860]  and manually opening and closing shades.
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:44.700]  It is nice to have it be automated.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:55.500]  But to do it through Alexa, you have to say, I don't know if I'm going to trigger people's
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:56.860]  Alexas, but I'm sorry if I do.
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:03.500]  But you have to say like, Alexa, turn on living room shades down.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:09.500]  Cause we have a scene defined that you make these things called scenes.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:14.140]  And the scene says like, for example, like turn these three shades down or something
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:15.020]  like that.
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:16.060]  You have to give it a name.
[02:17:16.060 --> 02:17:21.740]  And so the name would be a living room shades down, and then you can make another one living
[02:17:21.740 --> 02:17:22.860]  room shades up.
[02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:29.500]  Or you could name it, fuck you and say, fuck, right?
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:34.540]  Like, and you can define a scene called fuck you and fuck you means like, you could say
[02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:37.820]  it has all the shades down because you don't want anybody looking in your house.
[02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:42.220]  And then you would, to trigger that scene, you'd say, Alexa, turn on fuck you.
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:45.900]  But it linguistically, it just sucks.
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:51.580]  Like you can't just say, Alexa, turn, turn my shades down right here, you know, which
[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:56.220]  is what if you had a real living assistant, you could, you know, you could boss around.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:58.380]  You would just say, Hey, raise all the shades here.
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:05.500]  And your assistant knows where you are because they're obviously within listening distance.
[02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:06.700]  And so they know what you mean.
[02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:12.700]  But these the linguistic things, this turn on name of scene is ridiculous.
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:18.620]  And I don't know which aspects are limited by Amazon and which are limited by Lutron,
[02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:20.940]  which is the name of the company we got the shades from.
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:25.340]  But you're not allowed to use the words on or off in the name of a scene either.
[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:29.980]  You can use words like up and down, but like for lights, you can't name, say, like, turn
[02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:33.820]  on, you know, I just use the light switches.
[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:39.980]  Oh my God.
[02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.100]  That's priceless.
[02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:41.600]  Yeah.
[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:43.420]  I just use the light switches.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:43.740]  Yeah.
[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:44.240]  Yeah.
[02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:45.420]  That's what I do too.
[02:18:48.140 --> 02:18:48.940]  I don't know.
[02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:53.900]  So I think that Apple's onto something where there was an article this week about a series
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:19:00.780]  voice quality improving and, and Jaws was talking to David Pierce of Wired and, and
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:04.700]  talking, arguing, you know, complaining about that same thing that with the competing products
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:08.460]  from Amazon and from Google, you need to issue these precise.
[02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:13.500]  Command line, perfect word for exact same words in the right order.
[02:19:14.460 --> 02:19:15.980]  It's not conversational at all.
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:21.100]  So I think Apple has the right strategy with Siri of making it truly be like, understand
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:26.060]  what you're saying, but I thought it was a weird article cause it was really just bragging
[02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:29.580]  about the new and improved voice in iOS 11 and Siri does sound better.
[02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:31.340]  It sounds far more natural.
[02:19:31.340 --> 02:19:35.260]  It doesn't quite sound natural, natural, but it sounds more natural, which is obviously
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:40.380]  an improvement, but I, I, how many people, if you could choose between, I would like
[02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:45.020]  to have a better sounding Siri that works exactly the same, or I would like have Siri
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:47.580]  that sounds the same, but works better.
[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:49.660]  Like everybody I know would just want Siri to work better.
[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:51.660]  Yeah, that's, that's what I want.
[02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:52.940]  So I thought that was a weird article.
[02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:55.260]  I really thought it was a weird thing for Apple to be bragging about.
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:59.420]  I mean, it is a nice thing that, that the voice is improved, but it's, it, to me, that's
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:00.620]  like the last thing on the list.
[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.700]  Like the old Siri voice was fine.
[02:20:02.700 --> 02:20:03.200]  Yeah.
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:07.420]  Just make it work, make it understand what I, what I want.
[02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:08.300]  That's all I want.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.540]  It's like the iPhone, you know, I just want to be able to read it in the sun.
[02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:14.300]  That's it, that's it.
[02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:17.340]  All right, Jim, anything else you want to, anything else you want to talk about this
[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:17.840]  week?
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:18.780]  I think we got it.
[02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:20.140]  Anything else you expect on the show?
[02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:22.300]  I think that's it for the, for the event next week, right?
[02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:23.740]  It's going to be iPhones, iOS.
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:27.180]  Do you think that, all right, I guess the last but not least is HomePod.
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:28.780]  Do you think there's going to be anything about HomePod?
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:33.820]  I think they might do an update because we're expecting it, you know, any time now, but
[02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:38.140]  I, I think that they'll do an update if they have something that else that they're willing
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:38.620]  to share.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:43.900]  Because if you remember at WDC, there's a lot that they wouldn't talk about, you know,
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:46.140]  like the Siri integration and all that.
[02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:53.500]  If they're willing to talk about that stuff, then they may do a segment on it during the
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:54.000]  keynote.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:57.580]  If they're not ready to talk about that stuff yet, I don't think we'll see it.
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:03.100]  I thought the more I think about it after WWDC, I thought, I think it's very clear in
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:08.780]  hindsight that the way that they pre-announced HomePod, and again, there's a perfect example
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:14.220]  of a product Apple's willing to pre-announce because anybody who's, here's the pitch for
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:16.300]  it and thinks, hmm, I might get that.
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:20.140]  They're only making a decision not to buy a competitor's product, right?
[02:21:20.140 --> 02:21:23.820]  It's, it's not like it's hurting the sales of any existing Apple products.
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:25.500]  So they, they pre-announced it.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:30.860]  The way they pre-announced it to me seemed very strategic that, that they only told us
[02:21:30.860 --> 02:21:34.300]  about things that can't be copied.
[02:21:34.300 --> 02:21:41.180]  I guess what it looks like could be copied, but like in terms of like not letting anybody
[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:46.620]  touch the demo units and not really telling us so much about what, how it works, I almost
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:50.540]  feel like that's because they, they thought if we tell people how it works, we're worried
[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:52.380]  our competitors are going to copy it.
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:57.580]  And we don't, you know, by, by holding it out until it actually ships is every month
[02:21:57.580 --> 02:22:01.180]  that the people, you know, features that might get copied or left behind.
[02:22:01.180 --> 02:22:02.220]  So that's my guess.
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:06.220]  They could announce a ship date at the, you know, I don't know.
[02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:10.220]  I mean, it's, you know, it would be like an under promise and over deliver thing if it's,
[02:22:10.220 --> 02:22:14.060]  you know, surprise, it's ready to sell or it's gonna, we're going to put it on, you
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:17.500]  know, it's going to go on sale the first week of October or something like that.
[02:22:17.500 --> 02:22:21.500]  Because I think every, I think based on WWDC, it made it sound like it wasn't going to ship
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:22.860]  until like December or something.
[02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:23.660]  Exactly.
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:25.660]  So yeah, that, that would be a great thing.
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:30.140]  But they're going to try their best to get all of these things out in time for the holiday
[02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.020]  shopping season.
[02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:31.980]  Hmm.
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:37.340]  That would be, you know, it would be an interesting angle would be if the new Apple TV integrates
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:43.020]  with the HomePod so that it would seamlessly let you use your HomePod as the speakers for
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:43.660]  your TV.
[02:22:43.660 --> 02:22:44.300]  Yeah.
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:52.220]  And as you know, having seen it, there are no optical or HDMI type things to put in there.
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:54.300]  So it would have to go over the network.
[02:22:54.300 --> 02:22:58.220]  And it would have to go over the network and connect to that, which I'm sure Apple could
[02:22:58.220 --> 02:22:59.020]  do some way.
[02:22:59.740 --> 02:22:59.900]  Yeah.
[02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:01.340]  Well, think about AirPods, right?
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:08.620]  They like two things that communicate over the air and have to be in perfect sync.
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:08.940]  Yeah.
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:10.700]  Or else you would go insane, right?
[02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:18.620]  Like if one AirPod was a 16th of a second behind the other one, you'd throw, you'd
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:19.580]  throw them in the gutter, right?
[02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:21.020]  I mean, you'd smash them.
[02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:22.780]  It would make you insane.
[02:23:22.780 --> 02:23:29.900]  So in terms of being able to wirelessly sync, at least within, let's just say, you know,
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:38.140]  a room, you know, distance literally down to the smallest perceptible fraction of an
[02:23:38.140 --> 02:23:41.500]  inch to keep two things, you know, a stream of wireless audio in sync.
[02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:44.940]  I would say AirPods are existence proof that Apple can do it.
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:47.820]  I think that would be really cool.
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:48.780]  It really would be.
[02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:56.060]  And then, and then it really makes the HomePod seem like it makes the appeal seem way, way
[02:23:56.060 --> 02:24:00.780]  higher to me because then it's the one audio device I have to put in my living room.
[02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:02.700]  I don't have to have a separate one for music.
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.100]  You know what I mean?
[02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:06.860]  Like that to me is the weird thing about the original HomePod pitch is that it is just
[02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:08.860]  for music and maybe podcasts.
[02:24:08.860 --> 02:24:10.700]  And it just seems weird to me.
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:15.180]  Like I could see like in your kitchen, maybe that makes sense because, you know, you don't
[02:24:15.180 --> 02:24:18.780]  it, you don't even want, you know, you don't really watch TV in your kitchen.
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:23.020]  You just listen to stuff, but as a living room device, it seems weird to me to have
[02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:27.100]  a really nice speaker that, that only is used for music.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:29.420]  And then when you watch TV, you have to have something else.
[02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:30.300]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:32.780]  So I would love, I would love that.
[02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:37.580]  I would love it if they announced that Apple TV and HomePod are work together.
[02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:39.500]  We'll see.
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:46.620]  And you know, what's interesting about that too is it would mean though that all the other
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:50.540]  stuff you do on your TV, like if you have a TiVo or if you have a PlayStation or a DVD
[02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:53.180]  player would still need their own audio.
[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:53.500]  Right.
[02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:55.660]  So I have a full Sonos system now.
[02:24:55.660 --> 02:24:55.900]  So.
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:57.020]  Right.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:57.580]  Exactly.
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:24:58.060]  Right.
[02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:02.780]  So that's, you know, you've already, I've put off, that's one reason I've put off getting
[02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:09.580]  a Sonos is just, I want to hear the whole HomePod story before, before plunking the money
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:10.380]  down on that.
[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:13.100]  Because if I can use the HomePod for more of it, that would be interesting.
[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:19.100]  But it would be, like I said, like the holy grail is to have your TV playing computer,
[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:24.540]  your Apple TV or your rock you or your Amazon fire TV or whatever, to be HDMI one, the main
[02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:24.780]  thing.
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:31.580]  If, if you get way better audio when you watch Apple TV, then when you watch anything else
[02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:36.460]  on your TV, that's going to make Apple TV more likely to be like your main go-to thing.
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:41.100]  Like, for example, I guess the canonical example of that would be which device do you use to
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:42.140]  watch Netflix?
[02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:45.420]  Because Netflix is the one where like everything has it, right?
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:49.500]  Your most modern, a lot of TVs literally have it built in.
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:52.060]  The TV itself has a, has a Netflix.
[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:53.580]  I always use Apple TV.
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:53.900]  Right.
[02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:54.940]  We can use, I do.
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:55.500]  That's what I use.
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:58.060]  I use Apple TV, but we have a PlayStation that has Netflix.
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:26:01.820]  We have a, uh, our TiVo can play Netflix.
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:04.060]  Everything has Netflix.
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:05.500]  So which one do you use for Netflix?
[02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:10.540]  Well, if Apple TV makes Netflix sound better, then it's more likely to be your, your first
[02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:10.940]  device.
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:12.860]  So that's my big prediction.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:14.540]  That's just made this up.
[02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:18.700]  That's my, that's the, I just came up with that, uh, right here talking to you, Jimmy
[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:23.420]  inspired me, but that's my prediction is a home pod Apple TV connection.
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:25.900]  Then it only works with the new Apple TV, not the old one.
[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:26.860]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:28.060]  I'd love that.
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:32.380]  That would be a big, I would be a reason that I don't have a 4k TV, but that would be
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:36.220]  a reason why I would buy the new Apple TV even though I don't have 4k TV.
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.820]  I would buy it for the home pod integration.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:39.900]  All right.
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:41.420]  I think that about wraps it up for me.
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:41.980]  This is a good thing.
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:43.340]  I'm going to, I'll see you in a couple of days.
[02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:44.220]  Yeah.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:46.060]  It's always nice to, I always liked that.
[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:47.580]  Uh, all right.
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:48.300]  I'll talk to you then.
[02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:50.940]  Maybe we'll do a periscope together like we did last year.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:51.740]  Yeah, really.
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:52.540]  That'd be fun.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:53.180]  Yeah.
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:53.580]  All right.
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:54.460]  I will see you next week.
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:55.340]  Anything else?
[02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:55.980]  No, that's it.
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:00.540]  People, people can read your, your fine work at the, uh, at the loop.
[02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:03.900]  It's a loop insight.com fine website.
[02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:07.500]  And then on Twitter, you're, you're Jay Dalrymple, right?
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:27.180]  That's me.
