[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Don't even know where to start. What do you want to start with?
[00:02.800 --> 00:08.060]  Johnny, I've Johnny I've I guess that's probably historically the biggest news of the week
[00:08.060 --> 00:10.060]  So we just talk about our new black watches
[00:14.640 --> 00:19.960]  So Monday Memorial Day US holiday I
[00:22.600 --> 00:24.600]  Was just I
[00:24.600 --> 00:30.260]  I so did not know what to make sense of this when it hit a story came out in the telegraph in
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.040]  the United Kingdom
[00:33.600 --> 00:35.740]  written by Stephen Fry who
[00:36.600 --> 00:43.000]  Though I don't I have some complaints about the article is a wonderful, you know, one of the world's most
[00:43.800 --> 00:45.800]  beloved
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.120]  Figures I mean he's a comedian actor writer longtime Apple fan
[00:50.120 --> 00:56.200]  And wrote a profile and I guess you'd call it a profile. I don't know it even the headline is weird
[00:56.200 --> 01:03.040]  It's the headline is when Stephen Fry met Johnny I've the self-confessed tech geek talks to Apple's newly promoted
[01:03.600 --> 01:05.600]  chief design officer
[01:07.120 --> 01:14.080]  In an exclusive interview in which I've's promotion is revealed for the first time Stephen Fry meets Johnny I've and his boss Apple chief
[01:14.200 --> 01:17.320]  Executive Tim Cook to talk spaceships design and Steve Jobs
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.320]  And
[01:20.280 --> 01:22.280]  So, you know
[01:23.400 --> 01:27.880]  So part of the news it's it's sort of a first-person account of hanging out with Johnny
[01:27.880 --> 01:30.160]  I've and Tim Cook which in and of itself is interesting
[01:30.160 --> 01:35.280]  but to me that it and the part that's just odd to me is that this this is how Apple chose to
[01:36.280 --> 01:38.280]  unveil the
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.960]  What would you call it the?
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.120]  Executive change which is that Johnny I've has been promoted from senior vice president of design to chief design officer
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.120]  and two of his lieutenants
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.760]  Richard Holworth and
[01:52.600 --> 02:00.120]  Alan Dye have been promoted to new titles vice president Holworth is vice president of industrial design and
[02:02.720 --> 02:04.440]  Alan
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.380]  Excuse me. Sorry about that. Alan Dye has been promoted to vice president of UI design
[02:11.360 --> 02:13.360]  It's super interesting because
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.920]  Richard Horvath has been working with Johnny I've for a long time in the industrial design department there. They're very close-knit team very
[02:20.960 --> 02:27.520]  Involved team and Alan Dye came over with iOS 7 which is just a couple of years and it's I mean
[02:27.520 --> 02:32.720]  It's a super fascinating topic to talk about because the dynamic of ID is that they all did work together for so long and we're so
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.520]  Used to collaborating but with hi Johnny I was new to it and he needed someone who was a strong
[02:38.520 --> 02:43.460]  Collaborator in UI but he didn't go with any of the traditional like Greg Christie
[02:43.760 --> 02:46.580]  Yeah team he went with Alan Dye for marketing
[02:47.000 --> 02:51.000]  And then I had to collaborate because he doesn't drop pixels as far as I know
[02:52.040 --> 02:54.320]  Yeah, Greg Christie's an interesting, you know
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.120]  I don't and that's one of the reasons I wanted to have you on talk about this because I feel like you're a little juiced
[02:58.120 --> 03:01.220]  In your your at least your mental Rolodex is a little bit more
[03:01.480 --> 03:06.160]  up to date than mine on some of the names and stuff like that, but Greg Christie is a great example like
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.160]  where I
[03:08.320 --> 03:11.440]  Mean, I don't even remember what his title was, but I remember it goes certainly
[03:11.440 --> 03:17.560]  I bought they don't tell you one of the weird things about WWDC is that they don't tell you who's presenting
[03:19.600 --> 03:25.120]  Until you go to the session or until you start playing the session and there is a credit that tells you who it is
[03:25.120 --> 03:27.800]  who's talking to you, but in advance they don't tell you and
[03:28.720 --> 03:35.480]  Sometimes who is giving the presentation is actually more of an indication as to what the subject is going to be than this than the title
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.680]  Of the session. Absolutely. I think I last saw Greg Christie
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.640]  I don't know if you did anything last year
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.380]  But I saw him do the big presentation on how they designed photos for iOS a couple years ago
[03:43.640 --> 03:47.920]  Yes, I remember that one right and it just because it just so happened that I you know
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.400]  The user interface stuff was always more interesting to me and always a little bit more
[03:51.560 --> 03:55.860]  You know up my in my wheelhouse as one might say
[03:56.480 --> 03:57.840]  I
[03:57.840 --> 03:59.840]  Almost said in my wheelbarrow
[03:59.840 --> 04:07.080]  In my wheelhouse as one would say I wound up in Greg's Christie led sessions many times over the years
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.800]  I think I seem to recall a long time ago. There was even like one that was more like a panel discussion
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.560]  Like stuff that they don't really do at WWDC anymore
[04:15.800 --> 04:16.480]  But yeah
[04:16.480 --> 04:20.720]  That was Greg Christie was from back in the day when there was like a general hi
[04:21.200 --> 04:25.680]  Team. Yeah, that was sort of I guess really just reported to jobs
[04:25.680 --> 04:30.320]  I didn't didn't really have wasn't really part of any kind of chain
[04:30.880 --> 04:35.920]  Yeah, as far as I mean H. I was always sort of elevated at Apple beyond where they would have been like maybe another company
[04:35.920 --> 04:41.280]  That would have been slaughtered in under some VP of some software product division somewhere, right?
[04:43.440 --> 04:44.800]  But
[04:44.800 --> 04:50.000]  You know and as I've sort of written out it just dipping my toes in part of this is that
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.240]  part of this is that one of the reasons Johnny I've wanted to bring user interface design and under his design team's umbrella is
[04:58.880 --> 05:02.960]  that he wasn't exactly happy with all of the with the direction that
[05:03.400 --> 05:09.800]  That interface design had gone at Apple in recent years or in the years prior. I mean because obviously it was a change
[05:09.800 --> 05:12.960]  I mean there's no I mean whether you love the iOS 7 and Yosemite
[05:13.280 --> 05:19.400]  Looks or whether you don't like them or whether you're ambivalent about them. Nobody can deny that there was a shift in in
[05:19.400 --> 05:21.400]  in aesthetics
[05:21.400 --> 05:25.080]  Absolutely, and that I mean, I think it feels like Scott Forrestal gets blamed for a lot of that
[05:25.080 --> 05:25.560]  But you know
[05:25.560 --> 05:31.600]  it was Steve Jobs's airplane that had the famous stitched leather texture that you wanted and he was a big proponent of that sort of
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.760]  affordance and Greg Christie and I'm blanking on the gentleman's last name Baz who
[05:36.560 --> 05:39.400]  Testified on all the Samsung lawsuits and then subsequently left Apple
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.560]  They were intimately involved in the early years of the iPhone design that whole team and that whole focus
[05:44.560 --> 05:48.220]  And he really did feel like he wanted something new when he came in. All right
[05:48.220 --> 05:54.180]  And you know Alan dies from you know came from as that in Apple terms marcom
[05:55.140 --> 05:59.280]  Which I don't does that widespread in the industry. I always thought that was sort of an Apple ISM
[05:59.580 --> 06:02.300]  No, I I used to work in work on so for me
[06:02.300 --> 06:08.420]  it's always been normal in an enterprise and I think you and I both worked in in print design for a while and
[06:08.820 --> 06:13.940]  I always found that sort of background and I know like Mark Edwards did that too and I always found that sort of background really
[06:14.140 --> 06:16.140]  Educational when you started moving into digital design
[06:16.140 --> 06:17.900]  Yeah
[06:17.900 --> 06:20.740]  And anyway, Greg Christie left Apple
[06:21.900 --> 06:23.860]  not immediately, but
[06:23.860 --> 06:25.460]  he left in
[06:25.460 --> 06:32.980]  Their panzerino story from April 9th to 2014 veteran designer Greg Christie departs, and I don't know that it's as simple
[06:32.980 --> 06:34.980]  I don't know the story there, but you know
[06:35.380 --> 06:37.380]  Whether it was it, you know
[06:37.740 --> 06:40.580]  Just well you picked him instead of me then I'm out, you know
[06:40.580 --> 06:44.740]  I don't know or if it was just you know, but Christie had been there for a long time and it's you know
[06:44.740 --> 06:48.480]  Maybe you know, he could just put his finger in the wind and tell it was time to go
[06:48.660 --> 06:52.140]  But yes, and there was definitely it was not exactly universally
[06:53.740 --> 06:55.740]  Seen as the right decision within Apple
[06:55.820 --> 06:57.100]  Well, I think that's absolutely true
[06:57.100 --> 07:00.020]  I think you said that really well and there was a joke around the time that you know
[07:00.020 --> 07:02.340]  We match it was gonna hate the direction, right? Yes
[07:02.500 --> 07:02.980]  Yeah
[07:02.980 --> 07:08.520]  but there's a lot of people who fell into that camp of liking rich textures and rich designs and
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.200]  They they they had to be on board at my understanding is it was a really big meeting where this whole direction was
[07:13.200 --> 07:15.980]  Announced and not everybody was happy with it
[07:15.980 --> 07:20.500]  but at the same time you have people like Greg Christie have people like army Lamora who
[07:21.160 --> 07:27.640]  Literally did forced marathons marathons of sprints for years and years and years and I think there comes to a point where you just you need
[07:27.640 --> 07:28.800]  to stop
[07:28.800 --> 07:33.880]  Especially if you're at that intense level of doing iOS and a yearly grind schedule. Yeah
[07:33.880 --> 07:44.000]  Yeah, so I think bottom line is because a whole worth is you know industrial design has been under Johnny's group
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.040]  I mean that was in fact that was Johnny's group. I think yes in the old days. Johnny's group really was just industrial design
[07:50.920 --> 07:52.320]  and
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.760]  Whole worth has been part of that and clearly, you know
[07:56.040 --> 08:02.400]  Johnny trusts him and they've gotten along and that whole group has by all accounts that I've ever read has always been very tight-knit
[08:02.400 --> 08:04.400]  And has gotten along
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.520]  Extremely, well that there's it's not just that they do good work, but that there's a true camaraderie
[08:09.520 --> 08:16.640]  I think that's been part of the secret of keeping because a lot of creative people they don't go very long term bill Watterson famously retired
[08:16.640 --> 08:19.000]  From Calvin and Hobbes and some people like George Lucas
[08:19.000 --> 08:24.260]  They end up making prequels, which is not the best of their work. And I think the relationship that ID group had
[08:25.160 --> 08:26.660]  When Steve jobs came back to Apple
[08:26.660 --> 08:31.520]  They were off somewhere in the boonies and he brought them to IL to and set them up and made them so important
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.480]  But that group seems to have sort of kept them all fed and energized and alive for many many years, right?
[08:36.760 --> 08:43.840]  It's you know, it's the holiest of Holies. Yes, you know the inner sanctum. I mean, that's like the that is the center of
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.080]  Infinite loop is that their design lab? I mean, maybe not that's not the physical center obviously, but it's the
[08:50.800 --> 08:56.840]  You know, it's the place that the least fewest number of people have ever seen. Yeah, very few key cards grant access there in right
[08:58.800 --> 09:00.600]  But
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.960]  you know prior to this shakeup where you know forced all was was ousted and
[09:07.240 --> 09:12.320]  UI design was placed under Johnny I've in that group prior to that there were
[09:12.560 --> 09:16.520]  hi, there were people who there was like an hi group, but then there were also like
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.900]  it was spread about where somebody might go off on a team and then they were you know,
[09:21.900 --> 09:26.960]  like I for example like with I think with the original iPhone and you correct me if I'm wrong because I could I could very
[09:26.960 --> 09:32.840]  Much be wrong on this as a basic story, but the basic gist was when they committed to doing the iPhone
[09:34.760 --> 09:37.680]  For stall was placed in charge of the software and
[09:38.560 --> 09:45.040]  for stall went around the company cherry-picking designers who he wanted and would you know
[09:45.440 --> 09:47.160]  Say and this is this part is true
[09:47.160 --> 09:52.360]  I don't know if he did it to everybody but at least for some people it was I'm putting together a team to do something
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.520]  and
[09:53.520 --> 09:54.640]  it's
[09:54.640 --> 09:57.640]  Gonna be the greatest thing in your career and I cannot tell you what it is
[09:57.640 --> 10:02.320]  But if you want to join, you know, you'll work harder than you ever have but it's gonna be great
[10:02.480 --> 10:05.800]  You're are you in or out? And if they said they're in then they were on the team
[10:05.800 --> 10:08.000]  But then it wasn't like there was this one
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.280]  Interface group that part of what they did is put together an iPhone team
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.320]  the iPhone team had its own interface group cherry-picked from around the company and
[10:17.320 --> 10:24.000]  And that it was like that with other projects to maybe to a lesser degree because the iPhone was you know a major major
[10:24.600 --> 10:25.920]  endeavor
[10:25.920 --> 10:27.920]  Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely true. And I think
[10:28.440 --> 10:31.000]  Nitin ganatra on debug was talking about how they had to all be
[10:31.680 --> 10:35.200]  Disclosed by Steve Jobs and when he wasn't around he would have to go into one room
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.960]  Look at the designs and then walk out to the undisclosed designers and sort of describe to them what they had to do
[10:39.960 --> 10:47.720]  Which is it makes sense I could see how it makes sense to Steve Jobs and it makes you know
[10:47.720 --> 10:51.600]  And it obviously worked out for Apple to some degree, but obviously was not a very
[10:52.920 --> 10:56.600]  There was an ad hoc nature to user interface design to software design
[10:57.200 --> 10:58.160]  Yeah, absolutely
[10:58.160 --> 11:04.120]  And they had limited design resources and they had to be shared and pooled and it sounds like a really grueling project to get out
[11:04.360 --> 11:06.360]  All right, and on the one side, I think you could argue
[11:06.360 --> 11:10.240]  You know and maybe but you know, it's one of those things where it doesn't have to be either-or
[11:10.240 --> 11:12.720]  They're not necessarily mutually exclusive on the one side
[11:12.720 --> 11:19.200]  You could say that what Johnny I've did orchestrated in 2011 with forced all going out and all of you
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.460]  I design being placed under him and picking new people to run it
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.440]  and
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.480]  setting a new style you could say that it was a power grab that it was an expansion of just you know,
[11:30.480 --> 11:33.200]  Just ego and an expansion of his power
[11:33.200 --> 11:37.880]  but in it, I think in a very reasonable sense you could say it was a
[11:38.520 --> 11:40.520]  growing up like it made
[11:41.080 --> 11:44.800]  The process of UI design much more orderly within Apple
[11:45.160 --> 11:49.840]  Because it wasn't spread about where each individual project might peel off its own team
[11:50.400 --> 11:52.320]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true
[11:52.320 --> 11:56.720]  And I think that's interesting to me is Scott for slot was widely known as I don't know how widely known but it was known
[11:56.720 --> 12:00.160]  That if Steve Jobs said I want leather for this if Scott for us
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.120]  But wasn't around the designer would almost lose his mind because it would just be no no, no
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.800]  No, no, and he'd burn through 40 50 100 different designs
[12:06.880 --> 12:11.920]  but if Scott was there he could say Steve will will pick one of these three and Steve would pick one of those three and
[12:11.920 --> 12:14.480]  That saved everyone a tremendous amount of work
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.100]  but in an Apple where there's no Steve Jobs the value of that for HI is or the
[12:19.280 --> 12:23.760]  Combination the alchemy of that is very different and then you have at the same time someone like Johnny
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.280]  I've sitting in the wings who was on the record. He'd said before he didn't like the skeuomorphic design
[12:28.280 --> 12:35.040]  yeah, one of the arguably the best designer in the world who's not allowed to take control or to to influence to put his tastes on
[12:35.040 --> 12:41.240]  The software that runs on his hardware and then Tim Cook comes in and it always reminded me of what Steve Jobs did when he returned
[12:41.240 --> 12:46.940]  To Apple when he said desktop laptop professional consumer and he came in and he just said design
[12:47.660 --> 12:49.160]  services
[12:49.160 --> 12:52.320]  Hardware and software and he made Apple very clean that way
[12:52.800 --> 12:55.440]  Mm-hmm in a way that it didn't need to be under jobs
[12:55.440 --> 12:58.440]  And again, I think that emphasizes that part of what made forest all
[12:59.460 --> 13:06.120]  Talented and essential and so so important to the history of you know, especially iOS, you know, you know the iPhone and iPad
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.920]  Wasn't just that he was good manager and by all accounts
[13:11.920 --> 13:17.280]  He was that he shipped OS is on time and there, you know, some people would argue they were more reliable
[13:18.440 --> 13:20.440]  etc
[13:20.440 --> 13:26.680]  But I and an uncanny ability he seemed to have is that he seemed it
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.260]  Wasn't just that he had good taste. It was that he knew Steve's taste and that his you know
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.440]  There one of the profiles was something that was written one of the pieces that was written about forest
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.760]  All was it's it might have been an unnamed person who was complaining that like
[13:41.240 --> 13:42.080]  You know
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.200]  They'd present stuff to forest all and forced all would say Steve wouldn't like that and then that was all he had to do
[13:47.200 --> 13:52.600]  Is say Steve wouldn't like it and that's enough to bounce you back to the drawing board and that it got tiresome over the time
[13:52.600 --> 13:59.400]  But I think it the fact that he lasted so long as a direct report to Steve Jobs in that role shows that
[13:59.880 --> 14:01.720]  He was right
[14:01.720 --> 14:05.300]  That he knew what he would like and what he wouldn't like
[14:05.720 --> 14:08.200]  And that in a company where you have something like Steve Jobs
[14:08.200 --> 14:14.040]  That's an essential skill to get anything done because he and we've both heard the story is like make that blue more beautiful that
[14:14.040 --> 14:17.040]  That can burn hours and weeks from a designer
[14:17.280 --> 14:20.800]  And if you can shortcut that process with someone like Scott Forest in the middle, that's immensely valuable
[14:21.400 --> 14:29.680]  Right because you couldn't just it wasn't like you were gonna get a chance at 10 a.m. On a Tuesday when he says
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.880]  You know, no, that's not good enough. You don't get a chance at 10 a.m
[14:34.880 --> 14:37.880]  The next day to also present to him you've got to wait
[14:37.880 --> 14:43.320]  You might be stuck waiting a week or longer before you get your next chance to get your project in front of him
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.240]  Yeah, or if there's something that's worth fighting for and there's been stories, you know, like like iTunes on Windows was a great example
[14:48.240 --> 14:49.360]  But there's a lot of smaller
[14:49.360 --> 14:51.600]  Example Scott was somebody who could go back to Steve and say look
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.240]  I really think we should take another look at this and then projects that might have otherwise been derailed in a few minutes
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.400]  Sometimes be gradually get back on track, right?
[14:59.400 --> 15:05.840]  So and rather than just merely and being an arbiter of good taste being an arbiter of Steve Jobs's. Yeah
[15:06.480 --> 15:09.080]  good taste was essential and
[15:10.200 --> 15:12.200]  I think you know
[15:12.200 --> 15:19.700]  In hindsight clearly not very valuable to Apple after Steve Jobs wasn't there because Tim Cook doesn't some cooks not it
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.480]  He's not Steve Jobs. So he doesn't need that service and Johnny. I've is he has peerless taste of his own
[15:25.480 --> 15:27.080]  So he doesn't need that service as well
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.120]  right different days and it does make you wonder in hindsight what some of because Ivan and and
[15:32.520 --> 15:34.560]  You know Steve Jobs famously, you know
[15:34.560 --> 15:40.740]  We're actually friends more than just collaborators and ate lunch together all the time and it makes you wonder how much
[15:40.740 --> 15:44.540]  Feedback Johnny had given him over the years, you know
[15:44.580 --> 15:51.900]  That was obviously rejected in terms of trying to steer the user interface in a direction more palatable to himself
[15:52.580 --> 15:56.060]  Without actually having any kind of actual role in it
[15:56.060 --> 16:02.620]  I think something you said a couple years ago was really astute there because the age before retina and especially when mobile devices were really
[16:02.620 --> 16:04.900]  New swipe to unlock nobody knew what that was
[16:04.900 --> 16:07.780]  So making a giant groove in there and making a very elaborate button
[16:07.780 --> 16:13.420]  It gave you that affordance that visual clue of how you had to use that and or Steve would say, you know
[16:13.420 --> 16:15.980]  This is a database app. I no one cares about that
[16:15.980 --> 16:17.820]  Give it a texture and it sounds dumb
[16:17.820 --> 16:23.660]  But if you're stumbling home tired or drunk and you open up an app and you're in contacts and there's no there's nothing to tell
[16:23.660 --> 16:27.940]  You which contacts it is. Maybe you're trying to call a cab in Game Center and you just you just don't know
[16:27.980 --> 16:33.180]  So there were a lot of usability reasons and just philosophical reasons why I think that started off
[16:33.180 --> 16:36.980]  But then as a transition to retina that sort of texture doesn't hold up anymore
[16:36.980 --> 16:39.460]  Yeah, I think it's a combination
[16:39.460 --> 16:44.500]  I emphasized that my years ago my thought was a lot more about the retina non retina and that
[16:44.700 --> 16:47.500]  you needed the other thing was in addition to just the
[16:47.740 --> 16:52.740]  affordances of knowing what to do and having that slide to unlock which is you know
[16:52.740 --> 16:57.140]  To me like just put that design itself not even the whole iPhone
[16:57.180 --> 17:02.940]  But just put that slide to unlock itself put that in the museum because that is it
[17:02.940 --> 17:07.060]  It it it it made people
[17:07.740 --> 17:12.460]  Wow, people wanted to buy the phone just from slide to unlock and it taught you how to use it, right?
[17:13.060 --> 17:14.860]  I
[17:14.860 --> 17:19.140]  I've my thought a couple of years ago was simply about the fact that even at
[17:19.700 --> 17:23.520]  163 pixels per inch which was pretty high for the time in 2007
[17:24.340 --> 17:28.100]  It still wasn't that high. It was only high compared to the
[17:28.100 --> 17:32.380]  120 to 130 ish pixels per inch we had on our max at the time
[17:33.180 --> 17:36.980]  That you needed to use those sort of Photoshop style
[17:37.700 --> 17:39.700]  user interface designs
[17:39.700 --> 17:43.940]  Just to make it look good so that as soon as you looked at it you thought oh that looks cool
[17:44.780 --> 17:51.180]  Because something like iOS 7 you just doesn't look that great on non retina
[17:51.180 --> 17:53.180]  It does nothing about it that makes you go Wow
[17:53.180 --> 17:59.800]  But I think that the affordance stuff was important too because I think the basic idea with the original iPhone
[18:01.340 --> 18:06.260]  Was that like Steve Jobs used the analogy when he introduced it that
[18:08.720 --> 18:12.380]  Here's all these other phones of the time and look what they've got they've got all these buttons
[18:12.500 --> 18:14.860]  But here's the thing about all these hardware buttons
[18:14.860 --> 18:18.100]  It reduces the amount of space you have now the screens only this big
[18:18.100 --> 18:23.300]  And then number two a year from now if we come up with this great idea for a new feature
[18:23.620 --> 18:28.820]  We're stuck with the buttons. We had already come up with a year ago, and that we've solved this problem years and years ago
[18:28.820 --> 18:30.060]  It's called a bitmap screen
[18:30.060 --> 18:36.580]  And then you can make all the buttons you want whenever you want and only have the buttons that you need right now on screen
[18:37.060 --> 18:41.980]  So we'll do the whole thing will just be a screen and we'll make the buttons in software
[18:42.340 --> 18:46.980]  but I think that the basic idea was make the buttons look like fake hardware and
[18:46.980 --> 18:51.680]  And that in every single app. It's like a dedicated device
[18:52.520 --> 18:55.100]  simulating a dedicated hardware device for that feature
[18:55.740 --> 18:58.940]  Yeah, and the Braun calculator is maybe a famous example of that
[18:58.940 --> 19:03.480]  It's people the thought was that people wouldn't know how to approach just a blank piece of glass
[19:03.480 --> 19:08.500]  And if you made it look like something they were familiar with at least they'd start tapping around and then discover how it worked
[19:09.100 --> 19:12.140]  Right or the the call recorder. Yes
[19:12.140 --> 19:17.900]  I know I don't that wasn't in the first OS but you know certainly was in you know, one of the early ones
[19:19.620 --> 19:21.620]  The compass is another one
[19:21.740 --> 19:25.420]  Real to real in the podcast app was probably the last big example of that
[19:25.660 --> 19:32.300]  right and even the ones that didn't have an analogy, you know something like male which didn't really have like a a
[19:33.380 --> 19:35.300]  Brown style, you know
[19:35.300 --> 19:41.620]  Gadget that you could compare it to just the fact that there were these little 3d effects between the you know
[19:41.620 --> 19:45.180]  the keyboard and the content area it just
[19:45.580 --> 19:46.940]  Ever so gently
[19:46.940 --> 19:51.260]  Suggested that this is what it would look like if you had a hardware device that was just for email
[19:51.580 --> 19:56.100]  And the original at least the first versions they didn't composite anywhere nearly as well as later versions
[19:56.100 --> 19:59.580]  Which is why we didn't get wallpaper until I think iOS 3 or iOS 4 actually
[19:59.580 --> 20:02.860]  So they had a lot they had a lot fewer things they could do visually
[20:03.460 --> 20:06.060]  Right. Well the basic and a basic idea
[20:06.060 --> 20:12.260]  I always thought with the original home screen was to make it look like at the home screen
[20:12.620 --> 20:14.660]  Level by having just a black wallpaper
[20:14.660 --> 20:20.700]  The idea was you've got this like device that is sort of like a calculator where each icon is a button
[20:21.100 --> 20:24.660]  Right. It's like this like a like a dial pad where instead of having
[20:25.420 --> 20:29.380]  Numbers right like an old phone the phones that they were replacing
[20:29.380 --> 20:37.300]  the the basic interface was a you know, one two three four five six seven eight nine and a zero
[20:37.940 --> 20:44.900]  Dialpad the dial pad on the iPhone was you know, these eleven apps. Yeah, that's a really good insight
[20:45.460 --> 20:51.220]  Absolutely. It was also different than some competitive products when not initially but when for example
[20:51.220 --> 20:53.060]  Android would later put widgets on the home screen
[20:53.060 --> 20:58.100]  It always felt like Apple never wanted the home screen to be a destination just a gateway, right?
[20:58.100 --> 21:05.260]  It was just a dial pad where you dial up whichever app you needed the device to transform itself into. Yes. Absolutely
[21:08.500 --> 21:10.260]  So I kind of you know
[21:10.260 --> 21:16.020]  We go back dialing all the way back to this news about Johnny I've and Greg Christie or not Greg Christie
[21:16.020 --> 21:21.240]  But you know, well and I on die and Richard Holworth. Well, and you know guys like Christie leaving
[21:21.240 --> 21:28.840]  It it turned UI design into something that works exactly like
[21:29.480 --> 21:36.080]  Industrial design had always worked at Apple like and in theory they could have done the same thing by not putting it under Johnny
[21:36.080 --> 21:40.160]  I've but just by picking somebody else like Greg Christie and setting up
[21:40.760 --> 21:44.480]  UI design as a separate peer to
[21:46.200 --> 21:51.160]  Industrial design right they could have named instead of putting it all under Johnny I've they could have said Johnny
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.400]  You're still in charge of industrial design you design all the hardware and now we've named this guy
[21:57.200 --> 22:01.560]  Could have been Greg Christie could have been anybody else. You are like the Johnny I've of
[22:02.320 --> 22:08.740]  UI design and you'll set up your own lab and you guys will design all the user interfaces didn't have to be in one
[22:08.760 --> 22:15.480]  But it you know, but I do think that either way it was the right way to go moving forward without jobs at the helm
[22:15.480 --> 22:22.840]  As CEO as somebody has to be in charge of the taste yes some you know, it had to be done
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.220]  Yeah, no
[22:24.220 --> 22:26.220]  I think that's very astute and I think the
[22:26.480 --> 22:32.760]  You could see clearly that right away the big the first big project that came out was iOS 7 and when they did the advertising
[22:32.760 --> 22:34.760]  for the iPhone 5c
[22:34.940 --> 22:37.120]  They had better together as their slogan
[22:37.120 --> 22:42.400]  They wanted to show that the pallets matched over that the hardware and the software being together was an important thing for them
[22:42.400 --> 22:49.440]  And that's probably the only reason obviously that had to have been driven by Johnny I've but that that was the benefit of putting all that
[22:49.440 --> 22:55.680]  Stuff together. Yeah, and I think the watch is the culmination of that because say what you want about the watch and what you know
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.680]  whether you like the the
[22:58.440 --> 23:02.520]  You know where you think the watch stands in terms of you know, is it better than the original iPhone?
[23:02.520 --> 23:06.160]  Is it better than the original iPad whatever? I don't think to me
[23:06.160 --> 23:13.680]  there's no doubt that the hardware and software integration are tighter with the watch than any any other device and
[23:14.720 --> 23:17.420]  talking about UI design in particular that the UI
[23:18.160 --> 23:21.680]  Just doesn't make any sense except in the context of this watch
[23:22.480 --> 23:28.760]  Yeah, and it's it is something brand new and it's also a category where traditionally Apple had 10 years of smartphones to look at or
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.920]  10 years of tablets of Windows tablet PC to look at watches were still very new
[23:32.920 --> 23:36.480]  You had the pebble you had a couple Samsung watches, but you know those those came later
[23:36.480 --> 23:39.560]  Probably after Apple had to do a lot of their original concepts for the watch
[23:39.600 --> 23:45.920]  So it's a project where Apple had to not just identify problems and see like this. We hate this because
[23:46.480 --> 23:48.000]  And they already loved watches
[23:48.000 --> 23:53.320]  But they had to sort of figure out how to make the watch a computer and not just a digital mechanism anymore. Yeah
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.120]  Famously, well, maybe not famous or maybe people don't know this but
[23:58.120 --> 24:03.080]  In the development of the original iPhone the four stalls
[24:03.520 --> 24:07.040]  Software team didn't see the prototypes of the hardware
[24:07.440 --> 24:09.000]  They were developing, you know
[24:09.000 --> 24:13.000]  They're like they knew the size of the screen and they knew obviously knew it was going to be a touchscreen
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.600]  but they didn't get to see what the prototypes look like and
[24:16.640 --> 24:20.240]  Which is a little bit less important. I feel like the software team just knowing okay
[24:20.240 --> 24:26.700]  It's a touchscreen that is, you know, 320 by 480 and you know, it's gonna be a piece of glass, you know touch it
[24:26.700 --> 24:28.620]  and
[24:28.620 --> 24:33.540]  Them working blind on the hardware is a little bit less meaningful than the fact that the hardware team
[24:34.020 --> 24:39.220]  Didn't get to see the software like and you've you I know you know this there's then and maybe it was even on eBay
[24:39.220 --> 24:41.900]  We're like a prototype that out like there was this like
[24:42.500 --> 24:47.700]  Super janky looking pro, you know, like stand-in OS. Yes
[24:48.900 --> 24:50.900]  It was so ugly
[24:50.900 --> 24:55.820]  Because the iPhone was originally purple and I think that was skank was the standard one
[24:58.780 --> 25:03.740]  We should try to find the link after this go was skank was like the codename for the the stand-in OS
[25:03.740 --> 25:06.700]  I think I don't know if it's just a stand-in OS or it's the it's the sort of the development
[25:07.300 --> 25:11.180]  That runs all the technical information that you need to grab from the electronics to do a lot of things
[25:13.100 --> 25:16.460]  Right, it was sort of like a diagnostic OS I guess you could say
[25:16.460 --> 25:20.300]  And purposefully did not look good at all
[25:20.460 --> 25:25.620]  It was you know made to look bad so that it wasn't like they lied to them and said hey
[25:25.620 --> 25:30.780]  This is the OS we're making they're like you guys don't get to see the OS make the hardware and here's this ugly
[25:31.180 --> 25:38.220]  Diagnostic OS where you can test to make sure that the you know, Wi-Fi antenna is doing what the Wi-Fi antenna is supposed to do
[25:38.460 --> 25:42.060]  Etc and so forth. Yeah, and I think even some of the earlier prototypes were just components
[25:42.060 --> 25:45.640]  And I think this has been true for years even with iPads and they're just components literally
[25:45.640 --> 25:47.640]  You bolt it down on boards
[25:48.480 --> 25:50.480]  Yes. Yeah, definitely
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.320]  Do you ever see like the like the early I iPod prototype?
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.080]  It's yeah, it's really big and it you know clearly was never supposed to fool anybody into thinking was the product but it's
[26:04.320 --> 26:06.320]  yeah, it's just like a bunch of
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.480]  Things on a board and there's a dial that you you know, that was the click wheel
[26:10.480 --> 26:13.960]  But it just looked like a nod, you know off to the side that you would spin around
[26:13.960 --> 26:15.800]  Well, it's smart because if you have to wait
[26:15.800 --> 26:19.440]  I mean you you can't you can't have one follow the other you have to be doing both at the same time
[26:19.440 --> 26:23.440]  So you have to use them in some sort of development state, right? But it's
[26:24.280 --> 26:29.440]  It seems very clear to me and I would be shocked to find out otherwise because it's with it
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.200]  You know was all one, you know, Johnny I've design lab
[26:32.200 --> 26:39.160]  But it's it seems very clear to me that the watch was developed with the software and the hardware at the same time
[26:39.160 --> 26:45.160]  Yeah, and it seems even beyond that because the there is some siloing like you have Kevin Lynch in charge of the software not Craig
[26:45.160 --> 26:45.680]  Federighi
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.760]  But it also seems like the people who do messaging for iOS are in touch with the people who are doing it for the watch
[26:50.760 --> 26:56.040]  And and there's not sort of that strict divide that there used to be and that results in all the stuff working together
[26:56.320 --> 26:58.320]  Maybe not perfectly but very well
[26:58.640 --> 27:01.820]  Right. I do think I think Lynch reports to Federighi though
[27:02.680 --> 27:07.960]  But the idea was that you know rather than spread federally thinner than he is that you know
[27:07.960 --> 27:11.120]  They needed somebody who is just going to be you know
[27:11.880 --> 27:14.440]  You know, what would they I don't know if he was I don't know how
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.400]  There's the Apple term the DRI directly responsible individual
[27:18.400 --> 27:20.600]  But at least he you know
[27:20.600 --> 27:23.560]  Somebody has to be the DRI for the OS itself
[27:23.560 --> 27:28.400]  If not the design of the OS and the actual like it's all coded up, you know
[27:28.400 --> 27:34.560]  Here's the build and the build is written. You know, this is the 1.0 for Apple watch and that was Kevin Lynch
[27:34.560 --> 27:39.680]  Yeah, I think someone also and this was definitely Scott for us only someone has to have that single act of will to birth something
[27:39.680 --> 27:43.160]  New and it's arguable whether the same person should mature that product
[27:43.160 --> 27:48.560]  But you you really have to have that person whose only job it is to make that product launch, right? So
[27:49.420 --> 27:54.720]  With the I've stored I I have to admit I'm guilty as charged where I'm my first read-through of the article
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.640]  Was I took a deep breath and thought who does is this?
[27:59.160 --> 28:01.920]  The first step to him going out the door
[28:01.920 --> 28:08.920]  And it was just like I wrote and it was like I read too much into it I think but that whole thing that he
[28:08.920 --> 28:09.880]  Was going to travel more
[28:09.880 --> 28:15.040]  I really did read at first my first take and I as I you know when I linked to it on daring fireball
[28:15.040 --> 28:18.000]  I thought that meant he might move back to England
[28:18.600 --> 28:26.120]  and a lot of that was based on my recollection of that of a 2011 story in the London Times that said that
[28:26.120 --> 28:34.400]  That while negotiating a new contract with Apple, I've wanted to put in, you know be authorized to work from London
[28:35.240 --> 28:37.840]  Or wherever he would live in England and that you know
[28:37.840 --> 28:39.980]  Tim Cook and whoever else at Apple was like no
[28:39.980 --> 28:46.000]  You've got to stay here and that there was a source of conflict which in hindsight was the only one report of it
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.380]  And then it seemed it's one of those things where it seems like there's there were a whole bunch of stories about it
[28:50.380 --> 28:57.020]  But every other story you can find about it is the London Times is reporting that blah blah blah Johnny
[28:57.020 --> 29:02.140]  I've wanted to move to England that there wasn't anybody else who said it their source for this was completely anonymous
[29:02.140 --> 29:04.140]  It certainly wasn't Johnny. I've
[29:04.340 --> 29:05.620]  and
[29:05.620 --> 29:11.580]  Asking around over, you know in the last week. It seems to me like that story was bullshit and was sort of a source of
[29:13.020 --> 29:16.700]  Consternation at Apple at the time because they knew it was bullshit
[29:16.700 --> 29:23.060]  It was bullshit, but they didn't want to say that it was bullshit just because they're Apple and they they don't talk about such things
[29:23.060 --> 29:26.740]  Well, I had the same thought as you initially just it because it was a British paper
[29:26.740 --> 29:27.660]  It was Steven fraud
[29:27.660 --> 29:32.500]  I could just I think that made of by of influenced me but yeah and not moving back necessarily
[29:32.500 --> 29:37.220]  But like if you were to spend the summers there and which is right months or three months that seemed perfectly logical to me
[29:37.220 --> 29:39.140]  Given his new role
[29:39.140 --> 29:43.220]  Yeah, that's another factor in it the fact that it wasn't a UK paper
[29:43.220 --> 29:45.220]  The
[29:45.540 --> 29:48.020]  Fact that it was, you know wasn't announced in a press release
[29:49.980 --> 29:51.980]  I forgot about
[29:53.540 --> 30:00.500]  And I've since linked to I linked to it yesterday on during fireball, but I forgot that in 2003 Avi to manian
[30:00.500 --> 30:13.060]  Took a promotion whether you want to put quotes around it or not to a title chief software technology Officer
[30:13.060 --> 30:22.300]  I think CSTO I forgot about that even though I just reread the story of it in the becoming Steve Jobs
[30:22.300 --> 30:28.740]  Which but the thing that I had forgotten was that the title started with chief. I I just because somehow
[30:28.740 --> 30:36.300]  Like the four-letter CSTO like if they had promoted him to chief technology officer just CTO
[30:36.300 --> 30:42.380]  I would have remembered that in a way that I didn't with chief software technology officer like somehow
[30:43.420 --> 30:46.140]  That sounded ceremonial to me right away
[30:46.140 --> 30:51.020]  And then even the description of it in the press release where Apple announced it sounded a little bit
[30:51.020 --> 30:57.220]  It just really it almost seemed almost definite that it was sort of a stepping aside. It was like inventing a title for him
[30:57.220 --> 31:02.260]  Yeah, so I kind of I should have remembered it, but I think in the back of my mind
[31:02.780 --> 31:07.220]  it's like subconsciously I did and that it also fueled my
[31:08.140 --> 31:14.340]  Because it was you know, that was 2003 and that was when Bertrand surlet surlay surlet. Yep
[31:15.620 --> 31:18.780]  Well, I say it's their let surlay surlet surlay
[31:19.420 --> 31:23.820]  I'm gonna get wrong. All right surlay Bertrand. I just know this Bertrand everybody called him Bertrand
[31:23.820 --> 31:30.700]  So Bertrand got promoted to senior vice president of software engineering and reported directly to Steve Jobs
[31:32.140 --> 31:35.700]  Which I really do think is sort of a key to the difference between
[31:36.380 --> 31:43.340]  Tevainian going to CSTO and Johnny I've going to chief design officer where the people who are getting promoted
[31:43.660 --> 31:49.940]  Underneath him to take more responsibility still report directly to I've not to Tim Cook or to somebody else
[31:49.940 --> 31:56.660]  The Tevainian he was essentially non-essential at that point Steve Jobs had a direct line of communication through a software stack and it made
[31:56.820 --> 32:00.500]  Tevainian superfluous and that was not a position that Steve Jobs suffered lightly
[32:01.020 --> 32:04.060]  Right, and it's actually kind of an interesting
[32:04.660 --> 32:08.980]  Let me see if I can fish this up here. I have this saved somewhere. I hope
[32:11.660 --> 32:13.540]  No, maybe not
[32:13.540 --> 32:15.980]  the gist of it is as told in the
[32:16.980 --> 32:18.980]  becoming Steve Jobs that it
[32:18.980 --> 32:26.340]  It wasn't necessarily that at the time that he immediately that Tevainian really wanted to like they ease my way out the door
[32:26.340 --> 32:31.060]  He really just wanted to get away from the day-to-day stuff and kind of work on blue sky stuff
[32:32.260 --> 32:35.340]  But that it just did not work with the way Steve Jobs
[32:37.820 --> 32:41.500]  Worked at the company. So here's the passage from becoming Steve Jobs
[32:42.660 --> 32:44.480]  It was unquestionably a promotion
[32:44.480 --> 32:50.180]  But it turned out to be a job without much of a portfolio Tevainian found himself with little concrete responsibility
[32:50.180 --> 32:53.900]  He felt out of the loop and realized that his new role would not work
[32:54.500 --> 33:01.700]  Quote being a pseudo individual staff person working for Steve doesn't work because he already has all the answers
[33:01.700 --> 33:06.420]  He didn't like it when I would be in a meeting where he was reviewing a product and I would have an opinion
[33:06.420 --> 33:09.460]  He just didn't like it and he grew to not like that
[33:09.460 --> 33:14.660]  I could be a senior person like that without having day-to-day responsibilities to deliver something
[33:14.660 --> 33:20.740]  He says Tim Cook now Apple CEO says that he worried about Tevainian leaving and urged Steve in
[33:20.980 --> 33:24.760]  2004 to figure out another challenge to keep the brilliant software engineer at Apple
[33:25.180 --> 33:31.260]  Steve looked at me cook remembers and goes I agree. He's really smart, but he's decided he doesn't want to work
[33:31.540 --> 33:37.380]  I've never found in my whole life that you could convince someone who doesn't want to work hard to work hard
[33:37.380 --> 33:40.060]  Another time. This is my favorite part of it
[33:41.540 --> 33:49.540]  Another time shortly after Steve had learned that Tevainian had taken up golf Steve carp to cook that something was really amiss golf
[33:49.540 --> 33:52.820]  He'd thundered incredulously who has time for golf
[33:54.780 --> 34:00.460]  Golf he famously wouldn't even let people join boards of directors. All right, they should be too busy at Apple to do that
[34:00.980 --> 34:04.500]  Well, I've also heard that they used to when they used to have their off-sites
[34:04.500 --> 34:07.260]  He wouldn't let them have it anywhere where there was a golf course. Yeah
[34:08.820 --> 34:10.900]  He was sort of anti golf which is
[34:11.940 --> 34:17.460]  Which is super interesting because in the article as strangely staged as it was they made sure to mention that Johnny
[34:17.460 --> 34:24.380]  I've still had had things on his plate to do like the store redesigns like campus too and other products
[34:24.860 --> 34:27.940]  yeah, which is a huge difference right and it's
[34:27.940 --> 34:34.740]  You know, it's just an enormous still I still think even with this and with these lieutenants taking over sort of direct day-to-day
[34:35.260 --> 34:39.140]  Responsibility for UI design and industrial design. He still is spread pretty thin
[34:39.140 --> 34:44.740]  But I think he's spread a little bit less than by administrative stuff. I think that's a that's a key thing
[34:44.740 --> 34:50.340]  We've seen recently too is that Apple if you look at what Eddie Q is responsible for that's that's almost an entire
[34:50.340 --> 34:54.060]  That is an entire company. It's got its own marketing. It's got its own software development. It's got it and
[34:54.060 --> 34:59.180]  They're bringing in people to sort of help him do that. We've marketing has always been stretched really thin
[34:59.180 --> 35:04.500]  but they've got more people in there lately and it just seems like it's it's a little more sane than it used to be and
[35:04.500 --> 35:06.300]  the responsibilities as they've grown
[35:06.300 --> 35:11.820]  The company didn't scale to account for that and the amount of work that the people at the top of those those organizations had to do
[35:12.060 --> 35:14.060]  Was just becoming ludicrous. Yeah
[35:16.140 --> 35:21.300]  So I think I have since concluded, you know, I mean who knows we'll see a couple years will let us know
[35:21.300 --> 35:25.340]  but I think that this actually is another one of those cases where
[35:25.620 --> 35:31.700]  As weird as the story was where it came out and it's my guess is this weirdness was sort of this is the way
[35:32.020 --> 35:34.700]  Johnny wanted to do it. And so okay. This is how they did it
[35:36.540 --> 35:40.900]  That it really is what they say it is it's a promotion it's a recognition
[35:40.900 --> 35:46.460]  Maybe it may be almost like a belated promotion where it's recognizing the authority. He already wielded within the company
[35:46.460 --> 35:52.420]  And he's not going anywhere. Well, that was the interesting thing because there was there was I think at least three discrete reactions to the news
[35:52.420 --> 35:56.100]  When it first came out one was that this was Johnny I've putting one foot out the door
[35:56.100 --> 35:57.580]  You know getting ready to wind down
[35:57.580 --> 36:03.260]  The other was that this was Johnny I've consolidating power because there was that old quote from Steve Jobs where he said no one had more
[36:03.260 --> 36:08.900]  Operational power at Apple besides himself than Johnny I've even though they had a chief operating officer
[36:08.900 --> 36:12.300]  which is you know, just it shows sort of his position in the company and
[36:12.300 --> 36:17.940]  Then the sort of the third one was like the Wall Street take where they're they're still upset that Apple doesn't disclose Johnny I've because
[36:17.940 --> 36:20.180]  it was a senior vice president with direct reports and
[36:20.580 --> 36:23.780]  Certainly one of the top 10 paid people at Apple and his salary is not disclosed
[36:23.780 --> 36:28.940]  But now as a chief design officer with very few direct reports, you could argue that it no longer needs to be
[36:29.700 --> 36:33.220]  Yeah, I don't think so. I don't know. I mean who knows about that
[36:33.220 --> 36:36.700]  I know that I I think I only tweeted about it, but maybe I blogged about it
[36:36.700 --> 36:43.620]  But it it it has a has struck me as weird over the years when they disclose executive payments who's on the list and who's not
[36:43.900 --> 36:46.100]  like aren'ts had to be last year because
[36:46.620 --> 36:51.220]  Her like the the I guess you just call it loop it under a signing bonus
[36:51.220 --> 36:54.660]  But she got an enormous amount up front like it's not her annual salary
[36:54.660 --> 37:00.500]  But she was just you know paid so much in her first year because like a signing bonus for taking the job that hers
[37:00.820 --> 37:02.820]  Her compensation had to be disclosed
[37:02.820 --> 37:07.220]  It sounds complicated. I read a fortune article. I forget who wrote it, but they were saying that it's the top 10
[37:08.420 --> 37:12.020]  Compensations on the team, but if they don't have policy making positions
[37:12.020 --> 37:17.540]  Then they're not included because they don't affect the what Wall Street cares about with the company and it just seems like a mess
[37:17.860 --> 37:19.860]  Yeah, it's it really does
[37:21.220 --> 37:25.260]  And you know my conclusion is really and you know, I don't want to be
[37:26.260 --> 37:28.740]  I'm not trying to be cute, but I'm not trying to be cute
[37:28.740 --> 37:34.180]  But I I more or less if you just listen to Tim Cook's words in the internal memo
[37:34.180 --> 37:38.020]  We're announcing the deal describing what Johnny's responsible for that
[37:38.020 --> 37:41.780]  he was responsible for hardware design and now he's responsible for UI design and
[37:42.180 --> 37:46.420]  packaging and he's supervising the design of the headquarters and
[37:48.100 --> 37:54.500]  The retail in that New Yorker profile said he was doing the ads too. I mean it really is Steve Jobs level of breadth
[37:54.500 --> 37:59.460]  yeah, I don't quite think ads like marketing like TV spots and
[38:00.580 --> 38:06.020]  Like magazine ads but like those videos that he does right like the videos for the keynote. Yeah
[38:06.980 --> 38:13.380]  so even though he's not on stage in the keynote because he did I really do and I think it's as simple as that he is just
[38:13.380 --> 38:18.420]  Is not keen as to be a public speaker, even though the few times he has done it. He's done fine
[38:18.420 --> 38:21.460]  I think it's like he just enjoys doing it. He's done fine
[38:21.460 --> 38:26.740]  I think it's like he just enjoys it so little and there's so much prep that's involved that he'd rather not
[38:26.740 --> 38:29.940]  but instead his involvement in the presentations is
[38:30.500 --> 38:35.460]  Literally supervising and if not editing, you know with his own hand the videos. Yeah
[38:36.980 --> 38:41.380]  And this seems to suit everyone's best interest because it it gets a word of the stuff that Johnny
[38:41.380 --> 38:44.500]  I've doesn't seem that happy to be doing which is the day-to-day managerial stuff
[38:44.500 --> 38:47.540]  But it also recognizes it almost like Apple's recognizing the job
[38:47.540 --> 38:53.300]  He was already doing and that sort of assures his future in the company because you don't want him to either get bored or to
[38:53.300 --> 38:57.780]  Feel like he's finished or to want something different. You want to keep him energized and engaged
[38:57.780 --> 39:00.420]  But at the same time it puts these two pillars underneath him
[39:00.420 --> 39:06.900]  So if anything does happen or he decides to leave you what you have a stable functional organization that can keep going underneath them
[39:06.900 --> 39:13.220]  And that's really yeah an apple. Yeah, that's exactly I do think that it makes a more sustainable organization
[39:13.220 --> 39:18.820]  Now, would that mean that they would have to appoint a new chief design officer afterwards? I don't know
[39:19.700 --> 39:22.500]  Haven't you see? Oh, yes, right exactly
[39:24.340 --> 39:26.340]  Although I think that's coming
[39:26.980 --> 39:32.980]  We can maybe just hold that thought and I'll do a sponsor break here and then we can we can talk about that
[39:33.860 --> 39:37.780]  But bottom line is I don't think Johnny Ive is going anywhere. I think this is sort of a
[39:39.300 --> 39:40.660]  You know
[39:40.660 --> 39:43.620]  you know, uh, this is sort of a uh,
[39:45.300 --> 39:51.620]  Like making it official that Johnny Ive and Tim Cook have a relationship like Tim Cook and Steve Jobs did
[39:52.100 --> 39:54.980]  like where there are two leaders of this company and
[39:55.700 --> 39:57.700]  it's a little different this time because
[39:58.740 --> 40:02.420]  The other way the guy with the you know, the CEO CEO
[40:02.980 --> 40:04.500]  right, like
[40:04.500 --> 40:07.140]  It's it's a little different but somebody has to be CEO
[40:07.140 --> 40:11.620]  But exactly I think in a way though that makes I've different from from
[40:11.620 --> 40:14.340]  Jobs is I don't think Johnny Ive would ever want to be CEO
[40:14.420 --> 40:20.660]  I think part of this is that he's getting away from some of the stuff that a CEO would have to do some of this
[40:21.380 --> 40:23.380]  administrative stuff
[40:23.380 --> 40:26.180]  You know, Johnny Ive has no interest in negotiating with
[40:27.220 --> 40:30.660]  CBS television to get them on Apple TV, right?
[40:30.660 --> 40:37.460]  So it's you know, it it just comes down to the personalities and the individual talent that they have but that he is
[40:38.020 --> 40:41.060]  As important to cook as cook was important to Steve Jobs
[40:41.220 --> 40:45.220]  Yeah, it's like you need those two sides of the coin doesn't really matter which side is on top at any given time
[40:45.220 --> 40:46.660]  But you need those two sides
[40:46.660 --> 40:50.260]  And the other thing that I thought was really good is the projects that Apple has coming up like
[40:50.340 --> 40:55.220]  Campus two and like project Titan. Those are things that Johnny Ive seems really interested in which makes it seem further unlikely
[40:55.220 --> 40:58.820]  That it's anything other than a better positioning of all the talent they have in place
[40:58.820 --> 41:03.540]  What's project type? That's the the automotive stuff. Oh, well, we can talk about that
[41:04.260 --> 41:10.900]  Let me take a break though and thank our first sponsor and it is our good friends at
[41:11.460 --> 41:17.300]  Fracture you guys know fracture long time sponsor of the show you guys keep buying their pictures
[41:17.300 --> 41:20.100]  So they keep coming back to sponsor it more. So keep doing it
[41:20.100 --> 41:25.460]  But if you haven't heard of it, you need to be reminded fracture is a service you go to their website
[41:25.460 --> 41:32.340]  And you send them your photos from any camera that you've whatever you've taken them with you pick a size could be small
[41:32.340 --> 41:38.100]  They've got real small ones fit on your desk could be big. They've got big 23 by 29 inch things you can mount on your wall
[41:39.460 --> 41:42.980]  You decide whether you want it rectangular or square it's up to you
[41:42.980 --> 41:45.780]  They've got all the sizes all the aspect ratios you could want
[41:46.340 --> 41:52.100]  They take your photos and they print them directly on glass right on the glass right on the surface
[41:52.100 --> 41:58.820]  Right on the glass right on the surface and they look amazing. They look like no other thing that i've ever seen
[42:00.260 --> 42:04.420]  They look so good that even no matter what the content of the photo is when you hang them up in your wall and you
[42:04.420 --> 42:08.980]  Have friends over or family over people they see them out of the corner eye and they say how did you do that?
[42:09.060 --> 42:11.060]  There's like a how did you do that aspect to it?
[42:11.620 --> 42:14.100]  Where at first they might think it's a regular photo
[42:14.100 --> 42:18.900]  but then they realize it's edge to edge and there is no frame around it and then they might think well, maybe it's like
[42:18.900 --> 42:26.740]  It's like a like a lcd type thing and then they realize that it's not it's not glowing. It's a real picture like just an artifact
[42:28.180 --> 42:29.380]  It's it's stunning
[42:29.380 --> 42:33.860]  And so it's one of those things that it's like I can tell you this because I have them hanging around my house
[42:33.940 --> 42:35.540]  And i've had people say wow
[42:35.540 --> 42:40.180]  How did you get that and then I go into the same spiel that I tell you about on a podcast telling them in person
[42:40.180 --> 42:41.460]  You should go there
[42:41.460 --> 42:42.420]  and
[42:42.420 --> 42:44.420]  buy them yourself
[42:44.420 --> 42:50.020]  it it really you have to see it to believe it and it's one of the hardest things I think for them to get across because
[42:50.020 --> 42:52.020]  When you go to their website, you don't get that
[42:52.420 --> 42:54.420]  There's no way to show you on a website
[42:54.660 --> 42:59.060]  A picture of a thing to show you what it really looks like when you're looking at it a picture of a picture
[42:59.220 --> 43:01.460]  Isn't the same thing is actually looking at the picture
[43:02.020 --> 43:08.580]  Really really impressive and you can get started at a really low price their prices are fantastic considering the quality of what you get
[43:08.580 --> 43:15.700]  Um, take your pictures father's day is coming up. I keep saying it's a great great gift for people in the in your family

[43:46.580 --> 43:49.780]  Some pictures for for father's day my thanks to them
[43:51.940 --> 43:54.260]  All right, so the car
[43:56.260 --> 43:58.260]  That's an interesting
[43:58.260 --> 44:04.820]  Interesting thing thinking about in the context of johnny. I've been promoted to chief design officer
[44:07.380 --> 44:09.140]  Because it's
[44:09.140 --> 44:11.140]  You think well, that's just all
[44:11.840 --> 44:13.840]  industrial design, but there's you know
[44:14.900 --> 44:17.940]  I think that if apple is going to do a car
[44:18.580 --> 44:20.580]  It is absolutely going to be
[44:21.520 --> 44:23.220]  completely
[44:23.220 --> 44:26.500]  You know it the computerification of car design
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.540]  Yeah
[44:27.540 --> 44:31.780]  Yeah, like there's no way that it's not going to involve both ui design and industrial design
[44:32.740 --> 44:39.380]  No, I would not be surprised if you know the same kinds of engineers who worked on iphones and other products are working on that now
[44:40.820 --> 44:46.100]  It's no guarantee that it's ever going to ship because I do think and you know that thousand knows forever. Yes mantra
[44:46.660 --> 44:48.980]  Some some of those knows come late
[44:50.900 --> 44:55.780]  We talked about this a couple weeks ago that you know that that tv just didn't ship for year after year after year
[44:55.780 --> 44:59.060]  After year after year, no one was interested in shipping it. They didn't think it was a great product
[44:59.300 --> 45:00.980]  So it just sits in the lab
[45:00.980 --> 45:07.300]  Right, but there was there there was there were tvs and I think in hindsight poor gene munster
[45:08.740 --> 45:15.300]  But I do think that that's one of the reasons munster was so convinced and one of the things that analysts wall street analysts like him
[45:16.020 --> 45:20.100]  Do is develop sources in the supply chain
[45:20.100 --> 45:25.620]  And the ones who are most accurate like uh, ming. Yeah, ming qi
[45:25.620 --> 45:34.020]  Ming qi what's it? Ming qi, you know and and some of the stunningly accurate things that he's had in recent years
[45:34.580 --> 45:39.140]  I think clearly come from the supply chain, you know that that he's talking to
[45:41.220 --> 45:47.780]  Like he for example nailed it on the screen sizes of the iphone six and six plus and I think it was because he had sources
[45:47.780 --> 45:50.900]  At sharp and whoever else is making the displays for those things
[45:53.780 --> 45:55.780]  I think munster
[45:55.780 --> 45:59.400]  Figured out through supply chain that apple was making tv prototypes
[46:00.020 --> 46:03.460]  And then just extreme, you know, and which is pretty, you know that they weren't just
[46:04.580 --> 46:09.620]  Things that apple had made in the johnny iv lab which never comes, you know
[46:09.620 --> 46:15.620]  Nothing ever leaks out of there, but they were in discussions with with manufacturers and wheels were starting to turn
[46:15.620 --> 46:22.020]  Over there just to get things set up and he just took that to mean well then that's a sure thing because I think with most
[46:22.020 --> 46:24.020]  Companies once you get to that point
[46:24.180 --> 46:26.180]  It's going to come out and they're going to see how it does
[46:27.060 --> 46:33.700]  Yeah, and apple's really different and apple prototypes almost everything like if if people like you or I can can think about it or talk
[46:33.700 --> 46:39.540]  Out loud about it on a website apple has thought about it and investigated it whether it's like touch screen max or arm max or
[46:39.940 --> 46:44.660]  television is all of that stuff when they when they don't ship something is because they've made an informed decision
[46:44.660 --> 46:48.340]  Based on actual experience with prototype products that they don't want to ship it
[46:49.700 --> 46:55.140]  Right, and so, you know, there's no guarantee that a car is ever going to ship but I def you know, oh god
[46:55.140 --> 46:58.500]  I'm this is gonna be a terrible pun, but I definitely think the wheels are turning
[46:59.060 --> 47:04.660]  Well, you look at it now like I was looking at cars the other day and even within the same brand the interfaces are completely
[47:04.660 --> 47:10.100]  Different from one model to the other there's and that just to me says there's no vision for how this stuff should be done
[47:10.100 --> 47:15.540]  Oh, I definitely think so. It's I've seen that I don't I've had my car since late 2006
[47:15.540 --> 47:22.100]  so it's been a while since I've shopped for a car, but I remember the last time I did and driving like two cars from the same brand and
[47:22.100 --> 47:23.220]  being
[47:23.220 --> 47:28.500]  just in the you know, not that it was driving my decision as to what to buy, but you know, just
[47:29.060 --> 47:31.560]  Absolutely rolling my eyes at the inconsistencies
[47:32.100 --> 47:38.180]  I bought my last car right before the advent of the infotainment system the connected stuff where you could just plug your iphone or
[47:38.180 --> 47:43.860]  Android phone into it. So I went to my dealer and I said, can I just upgrade to the next year's radio center?
[47:43.860 --> 47:45.540]  And they said no and I said, what do I have to do?
[47:45.540 --> 47:49.780]  They said buy another car and that to me is probably one of those things that apple just thinks is ludicrous
[47:49.780 --> 47:53.460]  Like it should be as easy to update what runs on your car as it is to what runs on your phone
[47:54.260 --> 47:56.500]  Right. I mean and not that you would be able to
[47:57.220 --> 47:59.220]  you know, like
[47:59.220 --> 48:00.900]  You should be able to get like a software update. Yes
[48:00.900 --> 48:04.580]  Right that that's what you should be able to get for your car
[48:04.580 --> 48:10.180]  Not that you should be able to take the actual computer out there at a certain level apple is a hey you have to buy
[48:10.180 --> 48:12.020]  You just have to buy a new phone. Yeah
[48:12.020 --> 48:17.780]  Uh company but on another level, you know, there are significant features that you get, you know
[48:18.340 --> 48:20.660]  Two years after buying your phone by upgrading it
[48:21.620 --> 48:27.780]  Yeah, I think that the same industry is just so far behind and and you're similar carplay carplay
[48:28.020 --> 48:32.660]  uh scott forest lot was working on that years ago and it just took forever to get to market and that should be
[48:32.660 --> 48:36.740]  I think the the slowness of that sort of a process and if apple's going to do that
[48:37.300 --> 48:42.740]  The way tesla for example had to build up their their car process. We're talking a years and years of
[48:43.520 --> 48:50.740]  Experimentation never mind a release schedule. Yeah, it's it's on a much longer time scale, but i've heard it's not
[48:50.740 --> 48:57.940]  It's not my original analogy. I don't know who i'm stealing from but that carplay is to apple's car what the rocker was to the iphone
[48:57.940 --> 49:01.460]  Even though the rocker was like one year before the iphone
[49:01.460 --> 49:02.900]  the carplay, uh
[49:02.900 --> 49:08.980]  To me is really interesting because it's part of this huge transition that apple's undergoing where before we had all this pull interface where?
[49:09.140 --> 49:11.780]  You'd have to go to some other place to well
[49:11.940 --> 49:16.980]  If we could just transition to apps for a second and app was this discrete bundle this little binary you download it on your phone
[49:16.980 --> 49:21.540]  And you tap it and all the functionality would be inside that and the same way webkit is now
[49:21.760 --> 49:24.980]  Http apps everywhere. It doesn't really it's not all bundled and stuff like that
[49:24.980 --> 49:31.780]  With ios 8 all the ui kit stuff is sort of an extensibility means that all an app functionality is now everywhere
[49:31.780 --> 49:36.580]  You can share to pinterest from a share extension. You can use one password from an action extension
[49:36.580 --> 49:41.620]  so the idea of those apps has sort of been torn apart and not only that not only can I just pull the
[49:41.940 --> 49:44.660]  Notifications that are down and use pcalc there without going to the app
[49:44.900 --> 49:48.420]  I can now shoot that app to my apple watch or shoot that app to my car
[49:48.420 --> 49:51.060]  It's like, you know, marco's overcast is running on cars now
[49:51.060 --> 49:55.940]  And I think that fundamentally changes what it what it's going to mean to be software and I think carplay was sort of
[49:56.260 --> 50:01.300]  One of the things apple was doing to experiment with what that what that's going to be going forward. Yeah
[50:03.700 --> 50:05.700]  Um
[50:05.700 --> 50:08.180]  It's now but i'm just trying to decide what to go to next we could go to
[50:08.500 --> 50:11.540]  I'll give you a pick and then we'll do the other one we could go to uh,
[50:12.340 --> 50:17.300]  Google i o which is past tense sort of I guess it's technically the same thing
[50:17.300 --> 50:23.620]  Like wrapping up its second day right now. Uh, or we could go to wwdc. I say we do the past first. We'll do google. Yes
[50:25.220 --> 50:29.700]  Um, and we'll do wwdc expectations afterwards so google i o
[50:30.660 --> 50:32.660]  Keynote yesterday
[50:32.900 --> 50:38.740]  Seemed to run about seven hours all this they were good this year. I mean, I think last year just went on forever
[50:38.740 --> 50:40.740]  This year it was just long
[50:41.700 --> 50:43.700]  Announced a lot
[50:43.700 --> 50:46.660]  Some of it quite, you know, pretty interesting to me. Um,
[50:47.300 --> 50:51.220]  I guess I guess maybe it was a little more focused than usual. It was restrained
[50:51.220 --> 50:54.340]  I mean, I remember some years where it would just almost seem like every five minutes
[50:54.340 --> 50:59.460]  It'd be an entirely new initiative or api or something being dropped and you'd never hear about them again
[50:59.460 --> 51:05.140]  And this year it seemed like they stuck to bigger more important things. Yeah and stuff that they truly expect to ship. Yeah
[51:05.460 --> 51:07.460]  I feel you know and you know
[51:07.460 --> 51:09.940]  Not that apple invented only talking about stuff that drives the car
[51:09.940 --> 51:15.400]  And you know, not that apple invented only talking about stuff that's really going to ship but I think it's a little more appley
[51:16.100 --> 51:17.460]  direction
[51:17.460 --> 51:19.780]  Um, the whole thing was the whole thing had a much more
[51:20.260 --> 51:22.500]  Uh and people get really upset when we talk about this stuff
[51:22.500 --> 51:27.700]  But it it had a much more apple sort of sensibility to it, especially with the new android features
[51:28.340 --> 51:32.260]  And you you could see this over time where originally to get market share. Google had to make everything
[51:32.900 --> 51:34.900]  Open and marketed as open as possible
[51:34.900 --> 51:40.340]  But now from google play services to store reviews, uh to a lot of the programs that they're doing
[51:40.660 --> 51:44.260]  They they need to exert a certain amount of control just to just to improve the experience
[51:44.580 --> 51:46.820]  And it looked like they're doing that again with this keynote
[51:48.180 --> 51:54.660]  Uh, yeah, I mean and and there's a lot of little things but one of those things that I noticed is um
[51:55.620 --> 51:58.900]  When they talked about it's a program that to me is very interesting
[51:58.900 --> 52:01.700]  But to me I to my knowledge hasn't taken off yet
[52:01.700 --> 52:06.900]  But I think has a good chance to is android one. Yes, which is their
[52:07.620 --> 52:08.740]  uh
[52:08.740 --> 52:11.220]  version of android that is meant for
[52:12.980 --> 52:20.020]  Quote-unquote developing countries, but it's for people who don't have who cannot afford five or six hundred dollar phones
[52:20.660 --> 52:22.660]  And so what if they can only afford?
[52:23.140 --> 52:30.200]  Um, you know a hundred dollar phone or a hundred and twenty five dollar phone. How good can you make that today in 2015?
[52:30.200 --> 52:31.720]  and
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.400]  The thing that struck me about that as being apple like not that apple is going after that market has any product that they don't
[52:37.480 --> 52:39.560]  There is no iphone that's targeted at that market
[52:39.640 --> 52:46.440]  But the way that it's apple like to me is that it's not a here's a version of android that runs on lower powered devices
[52:46.520 --> 52:50.040]  It's a a whole thing like a device certification program
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.840]  And the only way you get it is if you go along with them and if you do
[52:53.560 --> 52:55.000]  You're get you
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.280]  Google has apple style control over the os where you get the latest very, you know, you're getting android
[53:00.920 --> 53:01.720]  uh
[53:01.720 --> 53:09.240]  You know lollipop and then you'll get the android m update when it comes out because the only way to participate in this as an oem
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.640]  Is to go along with what google is saying
[53:12.280 --> 53:15.800]  I I there there's there's a lot to unpack for me and one thing that that
[53:16.920 --> 53:19.000]  maybe everyone knew this but me going into this but
[53:19.000 --> 53:25.560]  Uh, apple's been starting their their keynotes by reaffirming their corporate mantras and tim cook does that job?
[53:25.560 --> 53:31.000]  He's like the moral compass of apple and he talks about apple's north star being making great products and google
[53:31.080 --> 53:33.880]  They used to be don't don't be evil but more and more often now they're saying you know
[53:33.880 --> 53:39.240]  Google is to or google's purpose is to organize the world's data and make it easily accessible to everybody
[53:39.560 --> 53:42.920]  And once I said that I started watching the entire keynote through that lens
[53:43.320 --> 53:45.720]  And the thing like the the optimist in me is like wow
[53:45.720 --> 53:51.800]  Google's using all this money that they make to bring technology whether it's internet in balloons or low-cost phones to everybody
[53:52.120 --> 53:55.640]  But then the cynic in me was saying that if they really want to collect all the world's data
[53:55.880 --> 53:58.760]  They need to have everybody in the world giving them their data
[53:59.160 --> 54:02.200]  And then when you look at everything they announced all these services
[54:02.280 --> 54:07.080]  Especially the ones that are really cool are sort of what you feeds what you the drugs you give somebody
[54:07.080 --> 54:09.080]  So they'll go and feed the beast for you
[54:09.080 --> 54:16.280]  No, and there's a profound difference between apple wanting to make great products so that they can sell them at a high margin
[54:16.520 --> 54:17.480]  And make a good experience
[54:17.480 --> 54:22.440]  So you'll buy the next product where google has to make these services that are so good that you'll be willing to give them
[54:22.680 --> 54:28.200]  Your data on an ongoing basis and it's it's sort of a similar a similar strategy
[54:28.200 --> 54:31.560]  You can argue how successful each one is, but they're both phenomenally successful
[54:32.200 --> 54:34.200]  But so different from each other
[54:34.200 --> 54:39.000]  Yeah, and it's you know, the cynic and me always asks and they you know with any company
[54:39.240 --> 54:41.240]  But you know, how are they going to make money on this?
[54:41.800 --> 54:45.080]  How do they think they're going to make money on this and with a lot of their stuff? It's
[54:45.720 --> 54:52.440]  Very dubious to me like with the whole internet balloons thing and it to me the the honest way
[54:53.960 --> 54:59.400]  To make money on it would be to somehow take a share of what they're charging the people even if it's you know
[54:59.400 --> 55:04.600]  Compared to like us carriers, even if people there are only paying a few dollars a month for self-service
[55:05.400 --> 55:09.240]  You know by taking a share of that then they're making money the cynical way to do
[55:09.240 --> 55:14.040]  It would be if part of the terms of service for getting internet service through the google balloons
[55:14.440 --> 55:18.200]  Is that google gets to see and index all of the traffic going through?
[55:18.600 --> 55:21.160]  The thing that reminded me of a part of this is I remember a few years ago
[55:21.160 --> 55:22.760]  There was a google ad about a father
[55:22.760 --> 55:27.560]  Um setting up a some kind of google account might have been a gmail account for his baby and starting to
[55:27.560 --> 55:33.320]  Document the baby's life and there was pushback on that saying how can you try to encourage people to put their children's data in there?
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.480]  But now we live in a time where they just give google accounts to schools and people say thank you
[55:38.200 --> 55:40.040]  And they say they're not going to they're not going to
[55:40.680 --> 55:42.440]  Use that data and I take them at their word
[55:42.440 --> 55:46.280]  But I used to work in advanced analytics and the actual data is not always that important
[55:46.280 --> 55:53.080]  It's the you you get vast quantities of data. There's all sorts of patterns and behaviors market basket analysis and and
[55:53.080 --> 55:59.480]  Just trends and and things that you can find in that data that's immensely valuable and google showed that with things like the machine learning
[55:59.480 --> 56:01.960]  And the neural networks on how their driverless
[56:02.680 --> 56:08.860]  Cars can now start picking out other cars and pedestrians because they're committing enough data and enough patterns and enough behaviors
[56:09.240 --> 56:15.240]  To understand that and that that's going to be immensely valuable to them. So even if there's no direct return on a business unit
[56:16.440 --> 56:18.440]  Nature for things like the balloons
[56:18.440 --> 56:22.840]  All that stuff will feed their core business, which is collecting and making use of all that data
[56:24.840 --> 56:28.680]  Well, the question though is where do you you know the thing about
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.920]  Web search is that there is a place a very obvious place to show the ad
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.480]  Which is right there at the top of the results and it's you know
[56:40.360 --> 56:43.640]  I I think they say web search, you know search advertising
[56:43.640 --> 56:51.080]  Is 90 percent of google's remains 90 percent of google's revenue. I think they really it all comes down to that top spot in the results
[56:52.920 --> 56:54.920]  And
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.280]  In some sense, okay, it's simply giving internet to people around the world through the balloons
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.920]  They don't need to make any money from the balloons because those people are going to search on google and they're going to see those
[57:04.920 --> 57:06.920]  ads in the results
[57:07.800 --> 57:10.600]  I see that though as as such a big deal
[57:10.600 --> 57:18.040]  um, I see that though as as such diminishing returns and just for the cynical reason that if you're in an
[57:18.260 --> 57:20.120]  impoverished country the ads
[57:20.120 --> 57:26.600]  Those ad views just cannot be that valuable and that you're chasing instead of chasing pennies. You're chasing fractions of a penny
[57:27.240 --> 57:31.160]  And you you know, it's not that it means that google's going anywhere
[57:31.160 --> 57:34.600]  But it means that it's not I just don't see how that's a serious source of any kind of growth
[57:35.160 --> 57:35.480]  Yeah
[57:35.480 --> 57:38.360]  I think that's a lot to do with why you see them branching out and again
[57:38.360 --> 57:42.280]  Like when I my old job was doing this analytic stuff and it wasn't it wasn't really about search
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.680]  But there were other ways of making huge amounts of money
[57:44.680 --> 57:49.000]  So for example, if you go into a quickie mart and you buy coke the quickie
[57:49.160 --> 57:50.760]  The coke has no idea that you bought it
[57:50.760 --> 57:53.240]  But the quickie mart does and if you have a company that can go in
[57:53.560 --> 57:57.180]  And take that information you can sell that back to coke and then you can sell it to pepsi
[57:57.400 --> 57:58.920]  And if they bought doritos with it
[57:58.920 --> 58:01.880]  You can then sell that information to doritos and those companies use it
[58:02.040 --> 58:06.200]  When they decide where they're going to put their products on shelves or what combinations or what sales or?
[58:06.200 --> 58:11.080]  All this stuff is immensely valuable to companies who want to get into these emerging markets and
[58:11.640 --> 58:14.680]  Apple and a lot of companies have talked about the value of the brick countries
[58:14.680 --> 58:19.580]  But especially china is growing now russia is growing now brazil is growing now and they're going to have huge economies
[58:19.800 --> 58:23.160]  And I think having actionable intelligence on those economies will be valuable
[58:23.320 --> 58:28.040]  And if google is the one brokering all that then that makes google as opposed to facebook who's also doing these
[58:28.520 --> 58:31.400]  Emerging market internet initiatives. It gives them a better position
[58:32.120 --> 58:34.040]  my understanding is that uh
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.860]  Quickie mart in particular buzz cola has an exclusive
[58:38.040 --> 58:39.480]  I think that's true
[58:39.480 --> 58:41.480]  They don't even need to do any analytics
[58:42.040 --> 58:43.480]  I don't mean to sound like i'm down on go
[58:43.480 --> 58:48.280]  I just think that like you everybody some people think that you're not paying for this stuff and whether you're paying with money
[58:48.520 --> 58:53.720]  or with uh time or with attention or with data you're always paying and you just have to be
[58:54.120 --> 58:59.800]  To understand the cost that that your data is is valuable like money is valuable and whether it's worth it for you to make
[58:59.800 --> 59:05.080]  That exchange right? So speaking of paying for stuff that leads me directly to
[59:06.360 --> 59:10.680]  One of the top products that they announced that I owe this week that really caught my attention was google photos
[59:11.560 --> 59:13.080]  so google photos
[59:13.080 --> 59:17.800]  Is pretty much google's version of i i cloud photo library
[59:18.040 --> 59:21.880]  And I don't mean that I I wrote that and I don't mean it in the sense that I think they copied it
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.280]  I think it was inevitable for both companies to do this
[59:24.360 --> 59:28.200]  the basic idea was so obvious that of course they were both going to do it and
[59:28.200 --> 59:30.520]  It just so happened that you know apple
[59:31.160 --> 59:33.160]  Beat them to it
[59:33.240 --> 59:41.560]  It feels like the right solution. Yeah, which is basically you sign up and you have all of your devices where you deal with photos
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.040]  Uh signed in
[59:44.040 --> 59:46.040]  And then all of your photos
[59:46.280 --> 59:52.200]  Go to through one cloud library and are therefore available on all your devices
[59:52.440 --> 59:57.400]  And to save space that you don't have once you have that and if the truth is in the cloud meaning
[59:57.400 --> 01:00:04.840]  Your true library is the one that's in your cloud account then your devices don't have to have all of your photos and if you have
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.080]  32
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.040]  Gigabytes of photos and videos in your personal library
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:14.840]  You only need a fraction of them on your device at any time and the rest can all be represented by
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.680]  Truly tiny thumbnails and then drawn down from the cloud
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.800]  On demand when you want to open them
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.360]  You know, it's super smart and we used to call that you used to do that in storage a long time ago
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.440]  It's called nearline where you had all the frequently high value data frequently accessed high value data
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.840]  Right on the on the device because you needed to access it all the time and it had to be fast
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.000]  But everything else was stored just a step away on much cheaper storage and in much bigger capacity
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:45.560]  And you would just get it when you needed it and it was very infrequent that you would actually need it
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.240]  And this is the same so all the photos you've taken recently all the ones that are your favorite
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.760]  All the ones that you access all the time are just right there on your device
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.200]  So you tap them and they're there the ones that you maybe haven't looked at in three years
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.560]  You know, you probably won't look at very often if you have to tap that and it takes a second to download. Nobody really cares
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:08.700]  So they have two but the big difference to me the fundamental difference is that they're saying unlimited
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:14.200]  Storage for all of as many photos and videos as you want
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.440]  with the
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.960]  asterisk on unlimited being that they
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.720]  Recompress your photos in a hot, you know, in other words and then they're not quite I I don't I maybe somewhere
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.600]  There's a technical die
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:34.200]  But in other words, they're they're using Jake jpeg recompression to store good enough versions of your photos up to 16 megabytes
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.600]  You can pay for something which they call original which gives you the original the access to the original uncompressed
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.880]  But I think even then it's limited to 16 megabytes
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.400]  I could be wrong. I wasn't sure it sounded like if you're willing to pay for the storage
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:50.920]  You just got your photos, but they didn't say anything about raw either which I know apple stressed
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.080]  yes, which you know kind of may is one of those like
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:02.520]  You know difference between apple customers and google customers and i'm sure yes. I'm absolutely sure that there are some
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:08.920]  Pro photographers who shoot everything in raw using some of the best cameras on earth who also are android users
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:15.960]  No doubt about it, but I think the truth is that most professional photographers are probably apple customers and probably have iphones
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.800]  And care about things like that in a way that android users don't
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.720]  Or is just something that they will announce in the course of the product roll out
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.920]  Right, and of course all of this stuff can go on but the pricing difference is definitely different where you know
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.200]  It's it's pretty easy. And in fact depending, you know on how long you've been shooting digital
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.720]  Photographs, it might be likely for most people that they're all their complete collection of
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.120]  digital photographs
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.240]  Not just from their phone
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:48.600]  But you know everything they've taken for the last 10 years or so is already bigger than the free storage tier
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.080]  That apple offers whereas google's is it's free for however many want with that caveat that they're going to recompress them
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.280]  But to what they you know claim to be still a very high level
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.320]  Yeah, I know david mark on loop insight pointed this out. But again like this this is fine if you want if you're happy paying
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.920]  With data because the terms of service are kind of nebulous as to what they can do with it
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.600]  And I don't think they're going to do anything wrong with it and a lot of it is always just covering your ass if you
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:15.320]  Have to move servers or do something else and you don't want to be sued when you do the normal course of your business
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.760]  But you know with apple, you know, no one's going to show you an ad next to that photo
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.040]  Your photo is never going to be used as an ad at least apple is currently being run and they're not going to take you
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:28.200]  Do facial scans, uh, they're not going to say oh, you know, this is a photo of john grueber now
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.920]  I know what john grueber looks like and propagate that across their system where with google you might not care about that
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.200]  But again, you should and i'm not saying that apple couldn't reduce prices
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:42.040]  It's just google is subsidizing it based on their business model where apple's business model is not being used to subsidize photo
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:47.480]  The cost of storage one of the reasons I don't use gmail is I I don't like the idea of ads
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.280]  Next to my email and I really don't like the idea of copy and paste
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.800]  I don't like the idea of ads next to my email and I really don't like the idea of context sensitive ads next to my email
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.040]  And maybe that's just because i'm a funny
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:05.080]  fuddy duddy who's been using email since the terminal days, but it's like an email to me is very personal and I
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.080]  I
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:14.120]  It just bothers me. So bradley horowitz who's in apples or not apples google's vice president for like
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.520]  What is it like photos streaming and something else pretty interesting title very specific
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.360]  um
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.320]  But it was you know, more or less in charge of google photos had an interesting interview with stephen levy
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.760]  yesterday at stephen's back channel
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:35.400]  And he his analogy which I found pretty compelling was that google photos is gmail for your photos
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.800]  But then the flip side of that is what you just said. Well, wait your gmail has ads
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440]  next to your photos are you going to
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.520]  uh
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:51.320]  If you have photos of your family at disney world, are you going to get ads for universal orlando next to those photos?
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.240]  I would find that it I I would find that extremely bothersome
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.600]  With apple's photos you can click to identify people's faces
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.440]  google looks like they're doing that automatically and that's again to feed their machine learning system and
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.520]  I don't know if that bothers me or not
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.960]  There's a lot of things along this path that I got the nexus 5
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.120]  Um last year I tried to get the new nexus phone every year and I turned it on and I said you want to use
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.560]  Google now and I said yeah hell yeah because it reminds me of jarvis from the iron man movies
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.680]  I want to use that and the first thing it said is can we access your full web?
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.800]  Uh history and I said no and I said well then you can't use google now and that's technically not true
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.560]  There's a lot they could do for me without having to have access to my web history
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.880]  And they might have changed that since then. I haven't looked again
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.800]  But that that to me what like the cost the price of that service was too high
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.720]  um and again
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:40.920]  I'm I I consider paying with data the same thing as paying with money so I don't get that service now and I understand why
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.600]  People would be reticent
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:47.320]  And by all means if you think it's a fantastic service, it looks terrific. If you if you're not bothered by this at all
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.280]  You know great, but I think it's worth at least considering the cost of what these services are
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:58.360]  So here's the storage pricing for iCloud and add this is as of may 29th
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.800]  Who knows we might get some new storage pricing in two weeks. I don't know but it and delightfully so
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.160]  Uh, the dollar amounts are identical in uh us and canadian dollars. So
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.640]  For now no matter no matter which of me and renee you're thinking of here's what we pay
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.640]  20 gigabytes you pay a dollar a month 200 gigabytes four bucks a month
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.960]  500 is 10 bucks a month and a terabyte of storage is 20 bucks a month
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:27.960]  So to me that's a you know, it's not bad
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.600]  20 gigabytes is very possibly too small for an awful lot of people
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:40.360]  200 gigabytes is probably enough for just about everybody and it's four dollars a month, which is not that bad, but it's you know
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:47.880]  Oh, you know, let's round up. It's 50 bucks a year. And so apple is saying 50 bucks a year and google is saying nothing
[01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:52.200]  That's a difference. I'm not saying that's going to draw people to it, but it's
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.080]  you know
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:00.840]  It I pay for the uh, I pay for the half terabyte plan right now and it's absolutely a difference and also it's if you're on
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:05.560]  That free five gigabyte plan. It's not just photos. All your backups are in there as well and a lot of your other data
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:12.680]  Takes up that space as well. And if you look at what pure amazon s3 storage because apple is using amazon and asia
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.680]  I believe to actually store this stuff
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.320]  You you pay for you pay for the storage that you use so it's not an unheard of model
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.560]  But I think you know apple is selling these devices. They make a lot of money off these devices
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.360]  It would probably be a compelling value add to customers if you said you bought you bought a 64 gigabyte device
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:31.640]  You're starting off at 64 gigabytes. If you want more you can pay for it
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:37.000]  But at least you have enough to back up pretty much the content of that device. Yeah, I wonder
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.680]  You know
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:44.120]  Presum presumably apple is isn't paying like with a standard s3 plan. No
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.880]  I hope not wouldn't that be hilarious if eddie q just said set up like a just like signed into s3 and he just pays
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.600]  Like a regular bill every month
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.240]  There's a pile of paper bills in the laferrari next to him for every single icloud
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.040]  bite of data
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.040]  presumably apple has a
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.600]  Very special deal with amazon for their use of s3
[01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.920]  So who knows what they're paying and how
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.600]  How close but it's it would be curious to know
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.040]  How close apple as a company that is saying this is not our core competency
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.800]  So we're going to go out for storage and some of these, you know storage, you know
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:29.640]  Some of these services to amazon with s3 and microsoft with azure
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:38.280]  And even given our clout and the size of the offer we can make and our you know, apple's famous
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.320]  negotiating acumen
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:47.480]  Even so that's so let's just presume that they've gotten very good favorable rates from both amazon and microsoft
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:55.080]  It would be interesting to know how that compares to google's ability to do it completely internally
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.320]  in terms of cost
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.960]  And at what point is it valuable enough for apple where like maps they start to want to make that their own core competency?
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:10.440]  Right, like how much does it you know, is there a a significant difference in the cost per typical user who says
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.200]  Okay. Yes, go ahead and store my entire photo library on your service
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.000]  What does that average out to for a typical user?
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:24.120]  For apple using s3 and who knows what else, you know, and and google doing it completely internally
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.320]  I think that would be interesting it would be extraordinarily difficult to figure this out because I think you know
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.600]  It's obviously secret information for both companies and I think it would benefit apple in the long run
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.960]  iCloud photo library I think is a tremendous product. I think it solves a problem in a really good way and cameras
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.760]  We know are incredibly important, especially in iphone upgrade cycles new cameras drive significant upgrades
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.240]  But if you always have friction if people feel either they don't use it or they feel it's too expensive
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.080]  They're often going to hit that wall where they just they can't take a photo they want to take it
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:58.040]  They have to delete something else and that reduces the experience and it's just one more piece of friction
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.080]  That they could probably use their resources to overcome
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:07.160]  Yeah, uh, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friend
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.360]  At warby parker warby parker is a new concept in eyewear. They were founded
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:19.480]  With a simple but lofty objective to create boutique quality classically crafted eyewear
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:26.680]  At revolutionary price points new pair of prescription glasses is typically pretty expensive hundreds of dollars
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.520]  Their idea is they could do it and and get them to start at 95 bucks
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.000]  So what do you do you go to their website you go to warby parker.com?
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:41.800]  And they have a whole bunch of eyeglasses right there to look from and you can filter the view you can look at all
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.800]  the ones like if you're
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:50.680]  Just looking at women's prescription eyewear you can just look at those if you're just looking at men's sunglasses
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.280]  You can just look at those you can filter it the way you want you can search for certain shapes
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.720]  Like if you know, you really want to look for rectangular frames you can filter on that
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.920]  And but here's what you do and you think here's I say this like with the mattresses and the pillows and all this stuff
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.240]  It's like well, how can you buy this stuff online?
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.280]  I mean glasses are so personal and your face and you never know you think hey
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.440]  I like these glasses those glasses look cool and then you try them on in the store and you look and you're like
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440]  Oh, this looks terrible on me
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Well, here's what you do you sign up
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.320]  and for free
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.000]  They you pick the five that you like the best and they do sign up
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.640]  For free, you pick the five that you like the best and they just send them to you for free, you know
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.880]  Not with prescription lenses. They just send them to you with you know, clear lenses you take them out
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:37.960]  You try them on you look in the mirror take a selfie you ask your uh, you know your friends your significant other
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.960]  You ask them. Hey, how do I look which one do you like?
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.200]  And whichever ones you like if you there's one you like if there's two you like whichever ones you like you send them all back
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.480]  Two or three days later and then you go back to the website and say well here's I know because I took them
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.200]  site and say well here's I know because I tried these on I want these frames and you give them your prescription from your
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.920]  you know your eye doctor and
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:04.120]  Like a couple of days later. Boom. You've got a brand new set of prescription glasses 95 bucks
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.240]  uh, they don't upsell you on stuff like
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:15.560]  Anti-reflective coating or using high index lenses high index lenses just is a fancy way of saying hey if your eyes are kind of bad
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.080]  Uh, the high index lenses lets the lenses still be relatively thin as opposed to you know, like coke bottle thick
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:25.480]  You want high index lenses if your eyes are bad because otherwise your glasses are going to be thick
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.680]  They just get you just get all that it's included
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:35.080]  Stuff you do have to pay more for would be progressives. That's if uh, you know, you need a
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.400]  Reader reading lens if you're older and you need, you know, regular lenses like near-sighted lenses at the top and
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:46.840]  Bifocals at the bottom so they start at 295 dollars which is a lot more than the regular ones
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.960]  But it's way less than you pay for good progressives at uh, most eyewear shops
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.520]  I just bought a new pair. I it's they seriously. I mean, this is just coincidence that the podcast timing is such
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.520]  I just bought a new pair a week ago
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.280]  Because with all this nonsense i'm going through with uh, you know with my eye
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.760]  uh, I needed a new prescription for my my old glasses the prescription in the left eye was
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:17.560]  No longer relevant. So I got a new pair. I bought them from orby parker showed up way in advance of what they promised
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.720]  I think they said like hey, you'll get them in 10 days and like four days later. Boom there they were
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.760]  And they look pretty cool and you know
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.520]  95 bucks and one of the reasons I was excited about it
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.920]  Is that there's a good chance with the stuff i'm going through with my eye that we even within a few months
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.360]  I might need a new prescription
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.920]  Um, so i'm not even out that much money if these glasses only last me, you know
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.800]  Three or four months before I need a different prescription in my left eye. I'm only at 95 bucks, which is absolutely great
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:52.360]  Uh, really really cool stuff. Now. Here's one last thing. I want to tell you about them is that they do a thing
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.960]  That I think is amazing. So there's people all around the world who cannot afford prescription glasses
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:02.040]  I cannot even imagine what that's like to need and to need prescription glasses
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:08.680]  And not be able to have them. Um, and so what they do is every time you place an order
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.440]  for
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:17.000]  Prescription glasses they make available to people around the world who can't afford them a pair of prescription glasses
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.280]  So in addition to the fact that you're only paying 95 bucks for cool glasses that come quickly
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:29.080]  And have a wide variety of styles. You're also doing something good for somebody else in the world who needs a pair of prescription glasses
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.520]  So it's really hard to beat that. So if you're in the market for glasses prescription or sunglasses
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.940]  Or prescription sunglasses go check them out. Uh, really can't recommend them enough warbyparker.com
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.880]  The talk show and uh, they'll know you came from the show so my thanks to them
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.520]  What else from i.o anything else yeah the google now
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.160]  Improvements and the I mean the android stuff was interesting
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.240]  But a lot of them I thought was very similar some of them at least was very similar to what apple been doing with ios
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.800]  For a while like with permissions and with battery usage, but the google now and the on tap stuff
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:07.400]  Which sadly doesn't mean beer is going to pour from your lightning port. I thought that at first
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.160]  But the uh, well, I guess they don't have lightning ports. They're usb port
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.600]  But the the the stuff about that is what makes me so interested in google is that
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.960]  It's they're trying to make these better contextual engines where they can present you
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.160]  Already like they know that if you have a flight coming because they read it off your email they can present you on the internet
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.600]  They read it off your email. They can present you with the boarding pass for that flight
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.640]  But now they want to start doing it when you're in locations and in areas that they haven't explored so far
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:36.440]  And this is an area that apple hasn't wanted to go into with serie and apple gets a lot of data from serie
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:42.840]  And for a while, they they just did not want to mingle or or act on your data on their servers
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.320]  It was their one of their privacy lines, but now with the proactive stuff that mark german was
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:52.360]  Reporting on last week. It sounds like maybe that's changing at apple and it makes me wonder what uh,
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:59.400]  What a service like google now or like on tap would be through apple's, uh strong privacy and security stance or filtering
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.520]  Yeah, can we do that?
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:06.600]  We'll just take a time out here and say young young mark german over at uh, nine to five mac has has been on a run
[01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:12.040]  Like no one else hats off to young young mark german, but he seems to have uh,
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:20.600]  Have uh, um uncovered about 90 to 95 of what has publicly been revealed about wwdc and what's coming out
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:22.520]  uh
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.400]  I do think that's an interesting direction for apple and
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.620]  I feel like uh, like with apple and google in particular
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:37.000]  That they each you know, depending on the nature of their companies get ahead of each other
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.840]  In certain ways and then the other catches up and you know, and sometimes we can say out well
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.480]  The one is copying the other but in the other hand, it's not even about copying
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:53.720]  It's really just like it's inevitable that they're both going to go in that direction and it can go from little things
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.200]  Like the copy and paste pop up
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.800]  You know you just how to select text and how to copy and paste it
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.920]  Uh, which you know ios didn't have in the first few revs famously
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.120]  Uh, you like you couldn't copy and paste and then but then when they got it they nailed it and it's like oh, yeah
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:12.840]  this is the way to copy and paste on a touch screen and
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.640]  android experimented with a whole bunch of things and all of them quite frankly in my opinion just really really stunk
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:22.040]  it was one of the areas where android was just
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.080]  It's just one of those things that drove me nuts about it every time I tried it and then coming up in android m
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.120]  They've got what's effectively the ios style of copy and paste
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.320]  Ios style of copy and paste. Yeah other things though, you know, same thing android had it first
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.940]  Where you swipe down from the top of the screen and you see a list of your notifications
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.280]  And they had that for like two years before ios had
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.120]  A notification center and guess what you swipe down from the top of your screen and there's a list of your notifications
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.280]  So it's not like it's a one-way street
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.800]  I think that this sort of contextually aware
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.680]  the phone knows some stuff about
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.240]  Where you are
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.200]  What you do, uh, you know where you are on a daily basis
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.920]  And can do smart things about it
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.200]  Yeah, I think it's like it does every time I hear them say, uh neural network or machine learning. I do think of the terminator
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.440]  Because you know, it's one of those things where you are where those movies sent to us as warnings and i'm saying that
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.640]  It sounds paranoid
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:23.400]  But you you never know how far this stuff is going to get and how much I want them to know about me
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.840]  Which goes back to the same privacy discussion about google now previously
[01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.280]  So I I would love to have jarvis in my house
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.000]  But when I start thinking about it, it's just as scary as it is attractive. So i'm i'm
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.120]  Conflicted about this technology, but I think it does have absolute value and if you don't like it
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:40.760]  um
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.440]  I would I would hope that a company like apple and eventually google would let you just use
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.120]  The functionality that siri provides today where it has minimal knowledge of you and the knowledge that it does have is on device knowledge
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.780]  And it's not doing any big data gathering or operations
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:58.300]  But for people who do want that who think that providing that data to get that service is a tremendous deal for them
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.540]  That I think apple providing it makes
[01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.180]  All of ios sort of more valuable to them
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.580]  I find some of the stuff in german's report on it to be a little confusing. Uh,
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.220]  because like his
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:20.540]  One of the things he says is that to begin with proactive will become a new layer within the ios operating system replacing the pull-down
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.920]  spotlight menu currently found on the ios home screen
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.680]  And you know again, I don't know where what his sources are. I don't know anything about this
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.200]  I've I'm you know completely in the dark never heard anything about it
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:37.360]  But that doesn't make any sense to me because that screen is not part of the os like the the two layers of the os
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.440]  That go from top or bottom is control center from the bottom
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:46.800]  And notification center from the top and the reason those I call them layers of the os is you can get them from anywhere
[01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.040]  Whereas to me what he's talking about is just part of the uh, you know to use the internal lingo. It's part of springboard
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.280]  Yeah, it's only when you're on the home screen
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.240]  And it doesn't make any sense to me that uh
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.520]  It doesn't make any sense to me that this feature wouldn't be available everywhere to me
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.800]  It would only make sense in the hold down the home button layer where siri takes over the whole screen
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.000]  But I don't know I think one of the things that I don't know if this is what he's describing or not. Um, but
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.400]  Previously apple was doing a lot of really cool things and part of those were surfaced in siri like siri
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.600]  Could do a lot of interesting search you could say like combine compare apple or google stock or get me these sports results
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:27.040]  And you could do a lot of interesting searches in spotlight
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.880]  Especially recently they made major changes to both siri and spotlight recently and spotlight could get you a bunch of interesting information including
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.520]  wikipedia and maps and ports of interest but
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:42.080]  And even app store search they were all different like some did nearest neighbor and some didn't and some did some didn't care if you
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:47.520]  Misspelled words and some didn't and so in in spite of having all these great technologies they they weren't merged together
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.160]  They didn't they weren't better than the sum of the parts and I think part of what this is is taking the engine that's being
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:57.360]  Built into spotlight and the engine that's in siri and sort of making something that is better than each of those individually
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.080]  And siri is sort of an ancillary interface layer. It doesn't replace
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:07.600]  It doesn't replace the the multi-touch interface, but it's there whenever you need it. Hmm. Well that makes sense
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:14.480]  What do you think about this this bothers me but maybe i'm just not aware of the lingo but it bothers that this whole trend towards
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.480]  Calling it machine learning
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:22.560]  bothers me because to me it's just ai we already have a term for it and my my my hunch is that
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.400]  Computer science the world had talked about ai for so long and for so many decades and
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.040]  You know famously, you know
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.320]  Kubrick thought that by 2001 we'd have a computer. You could just you know, how that you could just talk to you. So
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.640]  famously
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.840]  computer scientists as a whole were vastly over
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.160]  optimistic
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.160]  in terms of when we would get to
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:52.080]  Like talk to a computer and hold a conversation with them ai
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:59.280]  And that it burned out the term and so we come up with this new thing called machine learning that
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:05.840]  Is um, it doesn't you know, it's two different words, but it's just you know, a different branch of ai
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.920]  I remember uh in deuce was one of my favorite movie books and movies growing up where they had that butleri in jahad
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.040]  And they made a new commandment saying thou shalt make no machine that thinks like a man
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:20.480]  So it's been all part of our culture growing up and I by no means have any specific knowledge of ai
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.880]  But it does it does seem like there's this
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.240]  There's this recognition
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.960]  That's coming out that we're getting smart objects, but they're not smart the way i ai is right touch
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.880]  Id makes the home button smart the way siri makes the microphone smart the way
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.640]  Connect makes the the camera smart, but it's not smart in a terminator or matrix way
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.480]  It's just it's useful and I wonder if if this is sort of like what jeff hawkins was doing at namenta where?
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.960]  There was a realization that we can't make them think like us so we've got to go sort of part of the way there
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.880]  And this is they're using machine learning as a tool to make them think like us
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.400]  Is they're using machine learning as distinct from ai because it's not artificially intelligent in the way we always imagined it
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.160]  It's just a machine learning to recognize context in other specific areas
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:09.840]  yeah, one of the examples that google gave and it does seem and this is one of those areas where it seems like google is
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.600]  Not just ahead of apple but ahead of everybody but definitely ahead of apple is in the aforementioned google photos project
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.120]  Um, they're doing more so apple has been doing face recognition for for years
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:30.880]  Um, and you know, but they're doing a lot more they're doing like recognizing when a picture was of a snowfall and saying I mean
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.240]  Who now does this work? I don't know but that they're saying that you know
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.720]  You can say I remember that snowfall back in
[01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:42.800]  2010 and you could search for snow in 2010 and come up with the photos you took of the you know
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.120]  snow piled on your car or whatever, which is really pretty cool and it
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.840]  It but it also seems believable
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:53.680]  It seems like wow, I bet that's really complex and really interesting how they got there
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.240]  But I kind of believe it if they can do face recognition. Why can't they do this is you know a snowy scene
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.840]  It's sort of like when they told us that siri would get better when the more people use it
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.840]  It's all of these technologies require
[01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.160]  ungodly amounts of data
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:11.760]  it's part of why I think google really wants to get us to give it more data because
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.180]  Who knows how much it needs to consume of snow before it starts to understand and recognize?
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:22.020]  snow that movie ex-makana that just came out they have a guy there who sort of it's sort of like the google company in that
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:28.660]  Universe and in order to make his ai he he hacked every phone in the world to read every facial feature feature in the world
[01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:32.180]  So he'd have enough data to reproduce them and that was the volume that he needed
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.700]  and it always seemed to me like when you start doing facial recognition or snow or when you have driverless cars the amount of
[01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:44.580]  Raw data you need to get to what the car needs or the photo needs to to make the machine understand it is just immense
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.580]  Is just immense
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.540]  Yeah, I can totally see that
[01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.540]  um
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:53.860]  Anything else on io
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.460]  I think I think that was all the really I mean there was the cardboard stuff where they have vr and vr is fascinating to me
[01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:04.740]  It's like when facebook bought um oculus because uh, it's always been interesting to me that on a computer
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.900]  I can have facebook or google open in one little window, but then switch quickly or on a phone
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.060]  It's in one little app, but I can switch quickly
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:14.740]  But once it's vr and on your face, I mean, I don't know how to quit out of oculus
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:18.100]  When it's strapped to my head or quit out of cardboard when it's strapped to my face
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.420]  So it seems like that's sort of the complete all-encompassing presence that they've always wanted
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:28.180]  Yeah, have you ever used cardboard I haven't i've used oculus a couple times
[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.820]  And i've used google glass, but I haven't used cardboard
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:36.020]  I am worried that i'm not going to be able to use it
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:43.700]  I'm worried that my eye situation that maybe the time where I can see 3d is over. Um, but we'll see but it definitely seems interesting
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:49.300]  and I had to say like I was watching the keynote or at least I watched some of the google io keynote and uh,
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.820]  I was watching on the tv and my son had gotten home from school
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:58.900]  And he was like man this stuff this these guys are boring and then when that part kicked in he was like wait
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.900]  This is pretty cool
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.540]  So, I don't know I kind of you know, when they first came out with the last year, I thought it was kind of janky
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.980]  but
[01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:10.260]  Just because the only one they had was this seriously simple
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.300]  stupid cardboard thing but uh
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.380]  I don't know. It seems pretty interesting to be able to do it. I don't know but
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.060]  You raise a good point because this is one of the first interfaces where I mean
[01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.580]  There's always going to be accessibility issues
[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:28.180]  But this is one of these first interfaces where there's a tremendous amount of the population who can't watch 3d movies because they're just not
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:33.300]  comfortable with their eyes converging and focusing on different planes and they get vertigo or they get seasick and
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.980]  seasick and the they're trying to fix these but there will always be a large amount of
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:40.580]  People who will not be able to use this as an interface and to me
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:46.580]  Investing in it that heavily is interesting despite that even before I had this retina issue and had vision problems
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.820]  Uh, even before that even when I saw 20 20 out of both eyes at distance, um
[01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.700]  I've never enjoyed a 3d movie
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:00.020]  Other than like a short one at like disney like where you go in and you're in and out in five minutes and it's like
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.620]  Wow, that was pretty cool
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:06.980]  uh, and i'll tell you what it is for me is I go and see a 3d movie and I could I can see the
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:09.860]  3d and it's like I don't have any problems with the
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:15.540]  What do you call it? Like where some people have trouble seeing the 3d. Yeah, um
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:21.220]  But I would come out of the movie and and I will realize I don't remember the second half of it
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:26.900]  Like i'll be like I honest to god don't remember what the hell happened there. Like I remember I saw um,
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:34.100]  Uh, perfect example is up. I saw pixar's up in 3d for the first time and I came out thinking
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.500]  Hey, that was pretty good. And then I realized I I really
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:42.500]  The whole thing once once the kid was in the house. I really didn't remember I was like there was some kind of old
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.220]  You know, I remembered vaguely there was the old guy who had the dogs
[01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.340]  but it was like I I really could not summarize the plot like I
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:54.340]  I have to spend so much time concentrating on the 3d that I I cannot just sit back and watch the movie and then when
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:57.220]  I watched up the second time in 2d
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:02.020]  I was so much more impressed with the movie. I was like, wow, this is so clever
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:05.460]  This is a typical pixar movie where every single scene is good
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.700]  Every line is worth, you know, every line of dialogue is worth it
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:14.020]  It's like and I just didn't have that impression watching it in 3d. I had the same problem with it
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:20.580]  I I got accidentally I bought 3d tickets to avengers age of ultron and the the fight scenes were just undigestible to me
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:25.780]  There was so much visual information. I had very little idea what was happening and I went back and saw it in 2d and I was fine
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:31.620]  Yeah, I haven't seen it yet. My son has and tells me that it's I that i'm an idiot for not having seen it already
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.620]  That's ultron. It's ai the whole topic
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:40.980]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor and these guys
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:47.860]  Have been long time friends of the show haven't been with us for a while happy to have them back and it's mail route
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.860]  It's mail route
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.760]  I don't know. How would you pronounce it renee r-o-u-t-e?
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:29:00.440]  No, I do the same thing mail route, but some people might call it mail route. Well, either way m-a-i-l-r-o-u-t-e
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.060]  You know who you want protecting your email
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:10.980]  Email nerds who do nothing but email that's what mail route is
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.020]  These guys created the first cloud-based email filtering solution
[01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:18.260]  Uh, and they sold it to microsoft and now they're back with their own company
[01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.260]  uh
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:27.140]  And it is a really innovative and effective spam and virus filtering filtering for your email mail route
[01:29:27.620 --> 01:29:31.220]  So imagine a world without spam viruses bounced email
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:35.860]  Imagine the joy of opening your email and seeing only legit email that you need
[01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:41.460]  And imagine that with a mail server that you control your own mail server on your domain
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:45.860]  Uh for your organization something like that mail route wants you to feel this joy
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.460]  There's no hardware or software to install or maintain
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:54.260]  You don't go on your server and hook up mail route mail route simply receives your mail
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:58.020]  Sorts it and then delivers only clean email to your mailbox
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:01.220]  So what you do is you go in it's sort of like a dns type thing
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:08.420]  You go in and change your dns records your mx records for mail so that your mail for your server that you control goes through
[01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:12.500]  Mail route first they don't host your email. They're not an email hosting thing
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:17.540]  All they do is they the mail from the outside world comes through them first
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:22.260]  They filter it and then it goes on from mail route to your server
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:25.940]  So you're not giving up control of your server if you're an email admin or an it pro
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:32.180]  They're not asking you to let them host your email server. They're just saying filter your mail through them first
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:37.300]  This is all they do these guys. They're like like the world's you know, like
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:40.500]  Preeminent, like email experts all they do is email
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:47.940]  And it really works a charm it just removes all the cruft from your life and then your server
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.980]  Only has to deal with the good email
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.780]  They have tons of features apis anything you want, you know
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:31:02.020]  They're nerds you can set it up very simply and just have to say just hey just filter my spam and the crap
[01:31:02.020 --> 01:31:06.420]  And give me the rest you want to customize it. They've got everything you'd want to do to customize it
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:11.380]  You'd want to do to customize it if you are in charge of it at your at your company and stuff like that
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:15.700]  Really really really encourage you to check them out. It is a great service
[01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:21.620]  I know a whole bunch of people who have signed up for this and I haven't heard a single bad word about mail route
[01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:24.900]  So here's what you do go to mail route
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.060]  dot net
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:29.060]  mail route dot net
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.860]  Slash the talk show and you'll get a you get a free trial
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.580]  So you can try it out and if you don't like it
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:42.420]  Then you just change your your mx records back to pointing it directly at your mail server easy to change back
[01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:45.380]  You don't have to like copy all your email. You're not copying your email there
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:50.100]  You just change the mx record and all of a sudden you're back to where you were so you can undo the free trial
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:54.740]  At any time if you don't like it, but set it up set up the free trial start filtering your mail through them
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:00.020]  And use that that slash the talk show and you'll get 10 off not for the first month
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.780]  But forever for the lifetime of your account, you'll save 10 percent
[01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:07.700]  just for being smart enough to try mail route and smart enough to
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:12.180]  Listen to the talk show. So my thanks to them check out mail route
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:16.420]  Uh
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.420]  Anything else at i.o
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:21.400]  I think that was the main stuff. Yeah, so wwdc
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.500]  What do you think is coming up?
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:31.300]  Uh, I think apple is going to stick with ios 9 and os 10.11. I think we'll see the new apple tv
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.900]  We'll get some more word on homekit. Uh apple tv might come with a game store or an app store
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.460]  I think those will probably be the
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.620]  At least that the big stuff. Yeah, I
[01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.740]  am surprised to hear this but uh
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:46.500]  so
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:47.460]  at
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:52.900]  The code conference this week jeff williams was you know, and this is a conference that steve
[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.140]  This is the walt mosberg kara swisher
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:01.540]  Uh hosted conference that for years was like the all things d conference while they were at the wall street journal and now it's the code
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.740]  conference
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.740]  Uh now that they're on their own at recode
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.300]  slash comcast
[01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:13.140]  Zing
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.340]  And for years, I don't know if there's
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:21.860]  Maybe there's a year where nobody from apple showed up. I don't know but for years somebody from apple has has shown up job
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:27.540]  Has has shown up jobs was there many times and some of his most famous sort of off-the-cuff interviews in the last
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.860]  You know 10 15 years came with that conference
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:36.180]  Obviously, he's a pretty hard get he was a pretty hard get tim cook has spoken there a few years ago
[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.180]  That's the conference where tim cook
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.100]  Said that the wrist is interesting. This was that was two years ago
[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:48.340]  And this year, uh speaking from apple was jeff williams
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:52.660]  Uh, so I thought that was you know, as an apple nerd that was something that caught my eye because to me like
[01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:58.100]  Being an apple exec who is authorized within apple to go there and speak
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:04.500]  You know not necessarily open by the standards of open but you know instead wasn't just a bunch of no comments
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.180]  And in fact, he said some interesting things
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:12.180]  uh, but it's also sort of uh, another sign of jeff williams is leveling up within the
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:16.340]  Executive hierarchy. Yeah, we saw him do the research kit presentation
[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:22.260]  Yeah at the last event and I thought he did an excellent job for his first time. Yeah, and you know, and
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:28.980]  In addition to the fact that he did a great job on stage. It was to me an important
[01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:31.220]  An interesting thing that he announced
[01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:38.580]  And something that was dropped like a you know, a true surprise something that had not been leaked in any way
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.380]  I think the stuff that like if you look at the stuff that's in fedoriki's work that traditionally doesn't leak
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:49.540]  We don't start hearing about stuff until it starts leaving the that core group of engineers. Yeah, I agree
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:57.540]  So, you know first sign of jeff williams is leveling up was a significant on-stage presence at one of their public events
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:59.460]  and then another sign here is
[01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:07.940]  His appearance at the code conference and so my conjecture is that I don't know if it's imminent
[01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:14.420]  But I would think sooner rather than later jeff williams is going to get a promotion to chief operating officer
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:18.020]  Because he was sort of when tim cook was chief operating officer. Jeff williams was
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.620]  Right underneath him and then he became senior vice president of operations
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.380]  Which is not exactly the same thing as chief operating officer. It's not a c-level position
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:30.340]  So that makes that makes a lot of sense, especially if operations continues on one hand
[01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:32.660]  I can see it because tim cook is an operations guy
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:37.460]  So you might think you don't need a ceo when the ceo is in fact that good at operating
[01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:43.620]  That good at operations, but I think it just makes sense as as jeff williams continues to do these impressive projects that that title gets
[01:35:45.060 --> 01:35:52.260]  Yeah, I think so and well and quite frankly, I honestly think I think it's a lot harder to guess than it was with
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:59.220]  Steve jobs and tim cook, but my guess is that the current succession plan if something happened to tim cook
[01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:04.740]  Would be for jeff williams to be named ceo. Yeah, I thought the same thing and that it's
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:10.820]  It's it's and again, it's funny how things change where when when steve jobs, you know was
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.020]  uh sick and it was obvious I mean
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:20.180]  A responsible company would have a succession plan even with a perfectly healthy ceo like they have to I
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:28.740]  Well, it's a responsibility of the board if they don't then the board I think can be you know is is liable to shareholder suits, etc
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.420]  um
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:33.540]  Tim cook seems to me like the type of guy who you know
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.540]  Always has insurance, right?
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:40.420]  Right, like you don't have to remind him that you have to you know, you should you know
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:45.380]  Make sure you get uh renters insurance on that, you know rental property. It's like he he's already got it
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:52.260]  But my guess is that the current succession plan if it needed to come in would be for jeff williams and the funny difference
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:55.380]  Would be that when steve jobs they needed a succession plan
[01:36:55.940 --> 01:37:01.860]  Their idea was the last thing we're going to try to do is replace steve jobs with another steve jobs because there is no other
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:06.020]  steve jobs and whereas my guess with tim cook is
[01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:11.860]  We would replace him with the closest thing we have to another tim cook, which is jeff williams
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.740]  A guy with the exact same background
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:21.460]  You know, they just seem like you know two peas in a pod really I mean they and not that you know
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:26.980]  And i'm sure if you got to know them personally i'm sure that they're individuals but at least from the outside they are extremely
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:32.900]  They are extremely similar individuals operations background even they're both, uh from the us south
[01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:40.420]  They they seem to have similar demeanors even you know and and similar reputations within the company for
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.820]  Getting shit done
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:44.900]  And absolutely and steve jobs was unique
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:50.180]  but he did have some of the skills that are really important for a ceo including the ability to make those deals and the ability to
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:52.500]  to rally shareholders
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.500]  But a lot of the other things
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:38:00.180]  It's not typical like you said earlier johnny. I've probably has no aspirations to be ceo because that's that's not the kind of job
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:05.380]  You'd enjoy doing and I think that's true of a lot of them whether it's marketing or services or something else
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.340]  Like craig figurini federike a ceo makes no sense, right?
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.580]  Even though he's phenomenal, uh, jeff williams just seems like the best fit for that job
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:20.820]  Right, like what it really means to be a pure ceo. It really to me comes out of operations and combined with
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:27.300]  A deep understanding of what it is that makes apple apple, right and you know that I don't think you know
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:35.380]  I again, I really do not think that in the near future that they would ever consider looking outside the company
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:42.980]  For a replacement, you know ceo it would it would have to take a significant and I think years long
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:49.940]  Drought of you know of you know declines in revenue and problems with products, you know
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:54.420]  For them to even think about that it would have to be a situation where something was clearly going wrong
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.980]  Whereas as long as things are going right or in my opinion even just like, okay
[01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.580]  They're only going to look inside
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:08.260]  I agree completely. I don't think there's it's such a unique culture and getting someone at that level acclimatized to that culture
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:14.260]  I mean we've heard about having some of the problems with the vast amount of engineers, but getting an executive in there at that level
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:17.860]  I can understand bringing in angela aarons, but we saw what happened when he brought in
[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:20.500]  John browitt before that right. It's just not an easy thing to do
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:25.860]  You know years from now who knows, you know, I angela aarons could be on that list, too
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:31.700]  But it's you know, but it wouldn't be like a near-term if something happened near-term and I don't think that's going to happen
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:35.540]  I think tim cook is you know, I this he's made apple his life
[01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:39.460]  I think it would be like an emergency situation, but they have to have a plan for it
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.700]  so another way to look at it to me is
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:46.100]  You know, there are places you hear about places where they only like to hire software engineers from
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:49.700]  stanford mit and yes, you know caltech and carnegie melon
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.380]  Like if you're not in the top five comp sci programs, they don't want it
[01:39:54.020 --> 01:40:01.300]  They they don't want to look at you. I think apple for like a chief executive is only looking at graduates of apple university
[01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:07.880]  Yeah, no, I think that's like if you if you haven't gone through a years-long program through apple university
[01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:11.620]  And learned the apple way from the last 15 to 20 years
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:16.100]  They're not looking at you. And the only the only way to go through apple university is to
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.620]  Be a longtime executive at apple. Yeah, absolutely
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:25.540]  I think angel aris again running apple retail and stores is one of the closest jobs to being president of division of apple
[01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.820]  Maybe only itunes is similar. Yeah the scope of that operation
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:33.220]  So those those are two people who could and angel aris did run her own business for a long time
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.580]  But like you said that the length of time and the company is what makes it apple
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:40.260]  Yeah, yeah, it is sort of her own division and she's a very good person
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:44.980]  It is sort of her own division and and in a sense, you know, for example, she gets her own marketing
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:49.460]  You know again, i'm maybe the posters gum through schiller's group or whatever
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:56.500]  But just the general sense that when you walk into the apple store the experience of walking in I mean and literally
[01:40:56.580 --> 01:40:59.220]  I mean this totally literally like how it smells
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.260]  Every sense that is engaged when you're in that store
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:08.420]  Is a reflection of apple's brand and you know being and that's an enormous brand responsibility
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:14.260]  And again that makes it that makes her more like the president of a of a individual, you know a separate division
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:16.020]  Yeah, no, absolutely
[01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:17.220]  I think q is similar because again
[01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:22.100]  They have marketing and they have events and they have developers and they have designers and all those people working in itunes
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:24.260]  Could easily be its own company as well
[01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:28.580]  But he just seems ideally suited for what he does which is making those sort of entertainment deals
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:32.420]  Yeah, q would be on my short list of guesses though, too. Definitely
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:37.220]  which is interesting because I've been thinking about this a lot because there are all the rumors of the new apple tv coming out and
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:41.480]  The apple tv unlike the iphone and the ipad and the ipad is under the itunes organization
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:44.900]  And it's been so long since it was updated. It was last updated
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:47.700]  2012 the spring
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:52.500]  What that means for a product when apple looks at it as not just being a device but being a device that has to be
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:56.740]  Bundled with services in this case, you know media properties or content deals
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.740]  Because otherwise they could have just been updating this every year the way they've been updating iphones
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:06.580]  Yeah, so that's that's the thing i'm most excited about for wwdc this year at least unless they have you know
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.980]  Other than the vague idea that they have a complete surprise to pull the you know
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:16.980]  To pull the the curtain on but you know, so we blah blah blah new apple tv
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:23.540]  Uh, and maybe there's an sdk, etc, etc. We don't know anything about it. Like they've kept that that's
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:28.180]  Been like the details of it have been to at least from everything i've seen
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:34.260]  Uh, it's pretty pretty under wraps and but I really do think it's coming this year. I I would put money on it
[01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:37.940]  I think we can guess a little bit like it's running a single core a5 processor right now
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:41.300]  And they've almost certainly got to do they're going to go. It's an ios device
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:44.180]  It runs a version of ios 8 right now that has just a different
[01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:49.940]  Versioning number you mean right now meaning if you go into a store and buy a 90 or 69 apple tv right now, right?
[01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:54.340]  Yeah, single core a5 processor running ios 8.3. I think it's been updated 8.3
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:57.300]  Uh, but you know if they put an a7a8 class
[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:00.580]  Processor in there if they have if they let it run something like metal
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.500]  like if they start incorporating technologies into it like siri then I think if you just look at it as an ios device and you
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.500]  Bring it up to parity with last year's or this year's iphone or ipad
[01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:15.140]  Then that becomes a very maybe a more expensive device and we've seen before that becomes a really interesting device
[01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:20.820]  And you know just in terms it's crazy and they do these comparisons as they've gone to retina screens where they show
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.300]  Like what a 1080p
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:30.180]  Um tv pixel for pixel looks like on a retina 5k imac or something like that
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:35.860]  And you see oh my god, the 1080p tv is like just a tiny little rectangle in the corner. Um
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:43.220]  I mean you could do like side by side 1080p on a retina 5k. My mac, right? I'm pretty sure yeah
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:48.180]  Before you could do four of them and still have room for your palettes
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:54.260]  So the ridiculous thing is that a new apple tv to run a 1080p tv
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:44:01.700]  Is pushing way fewer pixels than uh an iphone 6 or 6 plus like it's just not even breaking a sweat
[01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:06.580]  In terms of that in terms of what they could get away with, you know at a cost efficient level
[01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:12.100]  So i'm really excited to see that to see what they do see what the input methods are
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:14.660]  and to see
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:16.660]  What kind of sdk they're giving?
[01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:18.260]  They're giving to us
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:23.300]  You know, that's the super interesting thing and I think you know, um, the the platform technologies group under johnny
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.980]  Suruji, the other johnny at apple, I think never gets the credit they deserve
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:33.380]  But if you look at something like the apple, um, the ipad air 2 that machine is ludicrously overpowered for what you can do on it
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.380]  That's got an a8x processor
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.660]  A lot of companies companies that make money off selling chips
[01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:43.140]  It's not in their best interest to move too fast because they want to get as much money as they can for every generation of chip
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:46.420]  Apple could care less so they just let these guys run as fast as they can
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:49.540]  They don't say oh the a7 is good enough. We'll use that for two or three years
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:55.060]  They don't know you can fit an extra core do it. You can fit an extra more gpu's do it and there
[01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:59.540]  I think for a while ios the software was perhaps ahead of the hardware
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.100]  But I think we've entered an age now where I don't even know what you do with the power in an ipad, too
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:05.700]  I don't think anything
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.380]  Uh, maybe a high-end game taxes a little bit
[01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:12.020]  But I don't think anything on ios taxes it and if you start putting that sort of power on an apple tv
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.660]  I don't outside of an sdk. I don't you don't need that to run hbo now
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:22.660]  So I think what they start doing both with the ipad going forward and with apple tv's so start answering the questions of
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.700]  Now that you have all the silicon, what do you run on it? Yeah
[01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:31.700]  Can I tell you what my dream feature for apple tv would be and i'm ripping it right off from my pal. John, syracuse
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:38.420]  Uh, I don't know if you do listen to the uh, the accidental, uh tech podcast. Absolutely. It's got uh, john for casey
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.420]  Oh
[01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:45.940]  Oh, yeah, all right, I got you I got you the other guy the moderator. Yeah the other guy
[01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:50.500]  Um, so syracuse had a rant a few episodes ago, and I know it's a recurring thing for him
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:52.500]  But his thing is you're watching a stream
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.140]  Or a video or whatever
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.220]  And you go to fast forward
[01:45:57.860 --> 01:45:59.060]  uh
[01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:02.340]  Or you pause for too long and then when you come back it's back at the beginning
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:03.220]  Yeah, right
[01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:09.060]  Like you're watching a netflix stream and you just want to like I understand that if it's streaming rather than completely download
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:12.900]  I'm, which it's like you just go listen to the episode of atp or syracuse arena
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:17.140]  But I just i'm completely in agreement with him if I want to fast forward
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:18.740]  uh
[01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.060]  A stream just show me, you know
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:26.580]  Uh thumbnails as it goes by but make sure that the time on even just if you just move the timeline
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:31.860]  And the scrubber and the timeline and don't even show me anything visually just let me see the timeline and pick
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:36.020]  And if I say I know I just want to go back two minutes and I just go back just
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:41.540]  Show the timeline animating for two minutes and then when I stop two minutes later and hit play
[01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:45.220]  If you need a second or two to catch up on the stream fine
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:52.500]  But make sure that that's where you start and the fact that so many streaming things on everything i've ever tried
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:55.140]  Don't work that way drives me nuts
[01:46:55.140 --> 01:47:02.500]  And it's even worse because like uh syracuse. We've been a tivo house since forever. I think I got a tivo
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.460]  in year 2000 when I
[01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.780]  my wife and I
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:12.340]  when I was working at barebone software, we went over rich siegel's house and he had a tivo and
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.780]  It we immediately went out the next day and bought a tivo
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:16.980]  We were like, this is the greatest thing ever
[01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:22.500]  But the thing with tivo is when you fast forward it always just fast forwards and when you rewind it always rewind
[01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.060]  Rewind and it always just starts where you want to start
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:30.180]  And you never have this problem and I know that's because tivo has downloaded everything to a hard drive in the box
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:34.520]  But the simple fact is that with tivo you can fast forward rewind
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:42.340]  Skim, you know scan whatever you want to call it backwards forwards jump forwards 15 minutes at any time and it just works
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:49.380]  And I swear to god if I have apple tv could just do that for stuff it that enough would sell me on it
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:52.740]  Yep, it's sort of like the original iphone when you scroll safari
[01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:54.660]  They didn't try to render the interface and slow you down
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:58.100]  Yeah, but you get where you were going and then filled it in behind you. Yes, that's what I want
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:01.540]  That's exactly what I want with, you know, like stream scanning
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.020]  And not to be a dick about it
[01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:08.980]  But also like I know that whatever content deal has been delaying or at least influencing the apple tv releases
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:11.540]  I'm not going to get that in canada anyway, so just ship me the hardware
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.500]  I never thought about that. It's sad
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:16.820]  God that sucks. Um
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:20.580]  Well, you'll still get the uh, I still think I think apple could do a better job
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:27.060]  Even with their own content the itunes content that you do get in canada and i'd really like to see them focus on that
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.620]  experience and put the sort of
[01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:37.540]  It's the comparing it to scrolling on the iphone is exactly right like obviously right from the get-go when when the software was
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:43.320]  Way more ambitious than the hardware could support they still focused on making sure the experience was responsive
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.040]  And that even if you had to wait to catch up at least you
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.240]  It wasn't like if you scrolled too far down on the web page all of a sudden it snapped you to the top
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.800]  Which would be make you mad but which happens with streaming stuff all the time
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.800]  And you know, uh, there's super smart engineers working on apple tv and maybe there were some frustrations
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.080]  Maybe there were some false starts, but it's they've had a long time now and it feels like there's a big technology gap
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:12.040]  That's going to help with performance and all and things are smarter now. So hopefully a lot of that will get rectified
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:17.400]  Yeah, my my you know, and again not to put too much on them because who knows maybe it'll be an underwhelming announcement
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:18.840]  And i'm not going to hold it against them
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:23.800]  But I will just say knowing that there are some really smart people who've been working on it for a while
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:29.800]  And that some of the whole lip if not all of it a lot of it has been content negotiation and figuring out what we're going
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.640]  To do in terms of service wise and it was external that it's possible that
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.920]  The internal team is really kind of might be on the you know, be able to to do like
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:42.760]  To do like it's like a 2.0 version of whatever it is that they were
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.200]  Going to if they might have shipped two years ago that they would have shipped then
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:48.620]  You know that they're already at like a next generation
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.440]  version of it
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.680]  And there's so much in ios 8 that they're not for example last year. We almost had no itunes announcements
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:58.840]  I can I can't I don't think I can remember very many at all and the ones we did get like itunes radio
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.920]  They never propagated because the beats merger effectively changed that whole strategy
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.360]  But we don't have continuity for itunes or for any form of media yet
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.920]  We can't just get up with the playlist playing on our mac just transfer it to our iphone and keep walking or
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.080]  If we're watching something on the apple tv and we want to go to bed
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.340]  We can't just pick up our ipad and you can go manually and chase after the functionality
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.120]  The way you used to have to do with productivity stuff on ios
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.180]  But it's not yet of that age and I think this is a huge opportunity
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.600]  and I don't know how many specific information about whether they're going to do it now or not, but there's
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.840]  A lot of stuff that they can just do to catch up and bring all this stuff forward that I think would be really interesting
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.400]  yeah, I wonder how some of the continuity stuff could work and with like
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.640]  A little bit of proximity awareness, you know, like how much easier could they make?
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.120]  you know
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:48.360]  Airplay by like I already know you're in the living room and you're watching a video
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.440]  And you know, maybe the apple tv could get ready to receive, you know
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:57.960]  The video so that the handoff happens much quicker in advance
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.640]  I don't know if you've played with handoff on the on the apple watch very much
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:07.960]  No, I actually haven't done handoff on the watch that much it's interesting because there's there's some collision right now because I have a mac
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:13.560]  And I have an iphone and I have my apple watch and you can hand off messages or mail or any of that kind of stuff
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:16.280]  But my my mac is broadcasting too
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:21.480]  So i'll pick up my iphone and i'll see the safari icon from my mac, but then i'll change windows then all of a sudden
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:25.000]  I'll see the messages icon from my watch and that sort of thing
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.840]  I think they're going to have to figure out too because now we're not going to just have an iphone and an ipad
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:34.280]  But you have the mac and the watch and maybe the apple tv and who get who gets that slot on the on the lock screen
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.280]  Or in the dock. Yeah
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:41.480]  All right. Let me uh, take one last break here and thank our final sponsor and then uh,
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:46.920]  We'll come back and wrap up the show with with our final thoughts. Um, but our last sponsor and I am
[01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:51.880]  Positively delighted to have them back. It's our good friends at harry's
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.480]  Now you guys know harry's harry's makes premium
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:00.280]  Men's shaving products everything from the handles to the razors to the creams
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:03.640]  Anything you need
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:11.240]  Really great stuff really great focus on quality design a sort of timeless design
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:17.000]  That isn't gimmicky. It doesn't look like a droid ad from verizon. It just looks like a nice classy
[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:21.160]  Handle for a razor a nice beautiful box
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:26.120]  Of razor blades, uh, and here's the thing they're by cutting out the middleman
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:31.080]  They make them they package them and then they sell them direct to you
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:38.040]  So you're not going through some kind of distributor and then distributor puts them in drugstores and then the drugstore sells them to you
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:41.640]  And it's marked up all along the way and when you're in the drugstore
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:47.720]  Because people shoplift this stuff you've they've got them behind a glass thing and you've got to hail down a clerk and then they
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:51.800]  Have to unlock the thing and then you pick it out and then they won't even let you take them
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.800]  They like walk you to the counter
[01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:59.400]  What a pain in the ass you go to harry's you sign up you pick the one you want you pick the starting kit you want
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.480]  And a couple of days later. Boom the thing arrives in the mail
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:10.840]  And they by cutting out the middleman their prices are just terrific. So just for example
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:16.440]  Uh, here's the thing the blades cost like two dollars or less per pack depending on what you do
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:20.120]  So for 15 bucks you get uh, you get a pack of eight
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:27.000]  You can't get a 15 pack of like Gillette high-end blades. Uh, I mean an eight pack for 15 bucks
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.840]  You know, they're like 32 dollars or something like that and that's even on amazon
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:36.680]  If you go if you buy 16 at a time, it's only 25 bucks. You only get a couple of bucks
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:42.840]  If you go if you buy 16 at a time, it's only 25 bucks. You're only paying a dollar 50 per blade cartridge
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.520]  and these are the type of cartridges, you know, there's four blades on the thing and
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:53.480]  You know a strip at the top to keep it comfortable comes in beautiful packaging makes you feel really good about it
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.160]  Really really cool stuff
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.720]  They also have things where you can sign up once you're a happy customer
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:04.840]  You can tell them how often you shave how often you go through stuff
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:10.040]  You can sign up get more or less like a subscription and blades just show up on a regular basis
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.120]  So you don't even have to remember to reorder
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.800]  but
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:17.720]  To get started before you know, you're not going to subscribe before you know how good this stuff is
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.240]  All you do is you go there you take a look around and you can get these sets
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.240]  They've got one called the truman set
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:28.200]  Gives you some shaving cream or gel a handle three blades
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.720]  Everything you need to get started 15 bucks. That's it
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:37.080]  They've got the winston set same type of stuff same three things except the blade is made out of
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:44.200]  Steel instead of plastic really cool stuff and then here's something else timing wise exactly. It's a great idea
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.320]  It's called the father's day shave set comes in a beautiful box
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.000]  You get to pick between foaming gel or shave cream
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:58.200]  It gives you everything you need to get started with harry's and
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:04.440]  Harry's in a just the box alone looks like it's worth it. It's the whole thing is only 40 bucks
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:08.360]  Really really great stuff
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.920]  Again, a no-brainer. I know it seems like a you know, like a it's like getting your dad a tie
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.880]  It's right out of the central cliche, you know get your dad a shaving kit
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:21.320]  But this is so nice and it's so nicely designed. I say go retro and do it. It is a great idea
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:23.400]  How can you go wrong with it?
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:26.600]  Really really cool stuff. I encourage you to go and check it out
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.760]  You just see that just the box alone looks like it's worth 40 bucks. Don't know how they these guys do it
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.920]  um
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.920]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:37.080]  Go to harrys.com
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.600]  Harrys.com

[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.760]  My thanks to them
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:05.720]  You know what I was wrong it's not 10 you save five bucks
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:09.240]  But anyway, that's what you save five bucks at checkout on your first purchase
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.880]  But it'll be about 10
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:18.200]  Um, depending on what you buy it's money in your pocket money in your pocket and a fantastic shaving kit
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:21.800]  Uh one last thing on my list of things to talk about
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.600]  Uh, I don't know if you have anything and maybe it's related to handoff and etc
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.720]  But one of the most curious pieces of news that have come out to me, you know what i'm going to say, right?
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.920]  All right, you say it discovery d discovery d
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.240]  Explain discovery d
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:44.600]  To people who may not be familiar with it. So apple did a lot of under the hood stuff with yosemite
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.000]  I think they rewrote launch d they rewrote discovery d
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.640]  and my original understanding is that this was a key component for things like continuity and
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.640]  For a world where you do have things like the apple watch and you need to be able to move
[01:56:56.040 --> 01:57:01.000]  Identify devices and move information not just information but actually activity back and forth between them
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:03.320]  But it was remarkably error-prone
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:08.620]  I think rich siegel was my favorite when he posted a screenshot showing apple tv bracket one all the way to 99
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:15.820]  Or something on his screen. All right. So for example if in the last year you've had an
[01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:19.660]  An experience where let anything on your home network
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:23.820]  Has suddenly gotten a new name where it was the old name
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:29.900]  Parentheses and an integer like example a perfect example that your apple tv no longer shows up as apple tv
[01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:31.900]  it's now called apple tv one or
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:34.060]  uh, you know
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.620]  jones iphone is now jones iphone 2
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:42.220]  That's discovery d that's an issue with discovery d or if your other computers on your network
[01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:46.220]  No longer show up in the finder like they're just there's not there anymore. They're only intermittently there
[01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:51.420]  I it does seem like they fixed my problem at some point, but we had a problem here
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:56.860]  I think I talked about it in the show a few months ago with our hp laser jet printer, which has
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:05.340]  Bonjour support and at first when we first got it a couple years ago. It was great because we no longer needed
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:11.820]  No longer needed uh, it it just go and set up a printer and it was listed and then it would figure out what it
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:17.900]  Was it was almost I swear and I know this is retro but in the old days of classic mac os with the chooser
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:19.420]  And we didn't even have network printer
[01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:25.020]  but you plugged a printer in your computer and you went to the chooser and there it was there was the printer and you selected
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:31.180]  It and then when you went to whatever app you were using to print it would print to that printer and there was no other
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:33.660]  No drivers to install
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:40.220]  No telling the computer what printer it is. It all identified itself. That's how it worked with our laser jet until
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:42.860]  You know yosemite and then all of a sudden
[01:58:43.980 --> 01:58:49.660]  You you printed yesterday and then you went to print today and it wouldn't print and then you'd go to see
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.540]  Where's the printer and it wouldn't even be listed. Yeah
[01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:59.420]  And if one of those fixes was to basically disconnect everything especially apple TVs and then reconnect it and it sounded
[01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:03.900]  I don't have the technical acumen to say what this is true or not, but it sounded like almost some form of cash poisoning
[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:09.180]  Where something would keep a bad list? Yeah, and it would just replicate errors over and over again
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:14.060]  Yeah, and it would maybe like hang on to old ideas of where something should be
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:21.820]  But the weird thing about it is it replaced something called m DNS responder and
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:26.180]  The weird thing is is people, you know again when I was younger
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:29.260]  I would have been right there with them, but they're you know people far braver than me
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.620]  a jury-rigged Yosemite to
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:35.500]  turn off discovery D and
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:39.980]  Replace it with m DNS responder from like
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:48.100]  I guess what we had before Mavericks. Yeah, like the last stable version of Mavericks which to me that type of stuff
[01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:49.860]  I can see why it works
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:56.380]  I'm not shocked that it works but to me that sort of doing surgery on the OS is not for me anymore, right?
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.380]  That's a young man's game
[01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:02.580]  But by every account I've read if there's like sets of instructions out there
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:06.340]  I wouldn't recommend following them if you're you know, I
[02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:12.060]  But there are and by all accounts at work that you could disable discovery D
[02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:19.060]  Go back to Mavericks version of m DNS responder and everything just worked and the weird thing is before that before somebody had figured out
[02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:26.580]  Here's a proven set of instructions to do it. The assumption was well they replaced and why did they replace m DNS responder?
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:32.360]  Which didn't have any of these problems with discovery D which has all of these problems and the consensus was well
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:35.520]  Some of these continuity features must depend on it
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:42.140]  and if you do this I get I'll bet some of the continuity features aren't gonna work anymore and apparently not and
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:45.060]  so the weird thing is that in
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:50.180]  What's still a beta the latest beta of ten point ten point four?
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:58.540]  that's is exactly what Apple has done is that discovery D is no longer there and they've gone back to m DNS responder it
[02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:02.300]  Feels like an MDS responder has been around since Jaguar
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:07.000]  but it feels like they they needed this rewrite or they felt they needed this rewrite and
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:10.540]  Oftentimes people at Apple will complain that they're not allowed to refactor old coder
[02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:12.180]  They just don't have the time to refactor it
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:17.820]  But it sounds like this went forward and they were given opportunities to fix it and there were fixes that were in almost every point
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:22.940]  release and it just got to a point where a decision was made that it's it's not being fixed right enough or fast enough and
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.020]  We're cutting baits
[02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:31.060]  And I don't know if this is just for now and they're testing it because what's weird is this is a beta so
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:34.060]  Unless it's in the shipping version. It's not gonna hit everybody
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.060]  So if the shipping version comes out with discovery D back in it
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:40.060]  And I don't know what this means it comes back with
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:44.420]  MS DNS responder in it then at least we know that that's been officially changed everywhere now
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:48.100]  M DNS or discovery D is also on iOS 8, right?
[02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:53.140]  I believe so. Yeah, I believe so too and I had a friend who said that he was with two
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:54.840]  This is a friend who does not work at Apple
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:01.140]  But I was out with a few Apple folks and joked I'll bet they replaced discovery D on iOS, too
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:06.140]  And and they they just went silent and the one the one Apple guy had to like stifle a laugh
[02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:10.420]  I don't know. I read that as you may but I mean that you know, and they wouldn't
[02:02:10.420 --> 02:02:14.420]  expect no further words for explained exchanged on the subject, but
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:19.740]  There might be something there. I think if you started asking you'll just get a clear saying too soon
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:26.940]  I my guess is there's somebody within Apple who's the DRI again directly responsible individual for discovery D
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:34.740]  Who is having trouble sleeping at night and when he wakes up in the morning is covered in sweat. Yes
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:38.700]  Because this sort of thing does not happen
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:41.460]  like they Apple stubbornly
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:45.740]  fixes these things rather than go back to
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:53.540]  Right like a rollback like this just is you know, and it's not the hugest deal in the world
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:57.980]  but it's just out of character for Apple and and another thing I have heard is
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.180]  Just loosely
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:06.820]  That in term in the aftermath of this coming out and just like asking around like what the hell it man
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:08.820]  That is you know, this is just crazy
[02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:10.660]  is
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:12.180]  that
[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:18.780]  Discovery D became like the whipping boy for anything and everything wrong with Yosemite
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:25.540]  Even if it had nothing to do with networking like just it a loose terms from the top
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:30.140]  It's this whole basic idea, you know and to go back even to Marco's
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:37.580]  Those functional high-ground thing this whole basic idea that Apple software has become a little less reliable
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:40.620]  with Yosemite
[02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:48.580]  Really rank really rankle people within Apple all the way up to the top and that you know
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:54.700]  I've talked about this but that you know, there were people who not who went in denial about it
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:58.340]  But who said wait our open bug count is lower than it's been in years
[02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.980]  We've you know, we've been fixing bugs at this incredible rate
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:08.500]  This doesn't it doesn't make sense that people think we've been getting less reliable or and we're getting fewer crash reports than ever things are crashing less
[02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:11.420]  all these ways they have internally of
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:13.740]  analytically measuring
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:21.660]  reliability we're saying Yosemite was as one of their best releases ever and the conventional wisdom out in user land was that it was one of
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:22.940]  the worst and
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:23.980]  the
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:26.460]  Whole thing came down to its discovery deeds fault
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:30.100]  Yeah, they were using the wrong metrics to qualify their success
[02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:34.540]  But discovered he became the poster child right and you could just see like in a pre Steve Jobs world
[02:04:34.540 --> 02:04:37.980]  He'd be sitting there with Apple TV 99 and want to throw the controller at somebody's head
[02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.020]  You know what?
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:46.700]  it actually doesn't it seem like a Steve Jobs decision that at some point there was like it obviously wasn't but at some point likes
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:47.460]  You know
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:54.900]  somebody got started about all these bugs with discovery D and there's this it frustration and and pride that Yosemite suppose forget and he's just like
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:05:00.280]  Fuck it. We're going back to MDNS responder and everybody in the room is like, well, we don't do that
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:06.540]  We and and then he leaves and it's like he just said we're going back to MDNS responder. And so it's like, okay
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:11.360]  And in the old days to bring the show full circle Scott what I said, don't worry about it. Give me two weeks
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.920]  I'll turn them around
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:17.560]  maybe and there's nobody there for that so that is a
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:23.400]  Curious story but in another way though. It's actually sort of makes me feel good
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:29.920]  It's like let's let's not be stubborn. Let's not be too prideful with the new thing. Let's just go with what works
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.560]  It's not doing something. This is no longer off the table, right?
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.800]  I think it's huge and it makes me because the other thing Jeff Williams said it
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:44.260]  Recode was confirming that the native SDK is coming for the watch and a lot of us at least I thought that discovery D was
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:47.200]  Intra mental to all that kind of stuff that they're doing now with extensions and
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:53.240]  You never know. It's brand new what's gonna happen? But this kind of culture I think is better is a better environment for it
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:56.240]  I skipped around a little bit, but I did want to say that about the code conference
[02:05:56.240 --> 02:05:59.620]  I thought that was such an interesting thing for him to reveal two weeks before
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:02.860]  WWDC that they're going to have the native SDK
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:09.900]  Which I really wasn't sure about I know a lot of people thought it was a no-brainer, but I thought you know
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:15.520]  Watch kit itself is still relatively new that you know, and I know that they said
[02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:19.700]  You know, I'm not on the one hand. I'm a little surprised in the other hand
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:24.360]  I'm not shocked because they did say it was coming later this year and if it is coming later to this year
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:29.140]  Why not unveil it at WWDC? I think some people think they're gonna actually get the SDK
[02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:32.860]  But it wasn't clear to me whether it was just a preview or they're actually be dropping the SDK at the show
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.180]  Yeah, I don't know and then it raises all sorts of questions
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:39.760]  Like how do you install developer releases of the OS on your watch and stuff like that?
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:47.360]  Special developer version of the of the Apple watch app for iPhone. I that's what I would guess right? That's what I would think
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:52.280]  Well, the whole thing is brandy. Like they just had the first Apple watch update very recently
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.520]  the update to iOS 8.3, which I guess they're calling Apple watch 1.0 point 1 and
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:01.600]  They had instructions for how to do it because it's very different than updating another Apple device. Yeah
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:07.760]  Yeah, because it's all it you can't do it on the device itself. It's all through the watch app on the phone
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:12.280]  So you have to put it you have to make sure it's on the charger has more than 50% because they're gonna turn Wi-Fi on
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:15.560]  Full blast to get the data over and then you have to you know
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.520]  You basically watch it on the phone then it switches over to the watch and reboot. It's an interesting procedure
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:24.720]  Yeah, yeah went very well for me and seemingly for everybody. Me too. Absolutely
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:30.280]  You have to think that I thought while that happened in the day that it happened that that has to be like such a gigantic
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:37.520]  Collective held breath for like Kevin Lynch's team. We're like no matter how well they've tested it and how confident they are
[02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:40.440]  It's like putting it out in a real world
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:47.120]  There could be you know, even like that 1% you know, like if 1% of the watches got bricked. It's like that is
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:51.380]  That's a failure and it's gonna be a PR disaster
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:53.880]  Especially because of the Iowa the iOS update
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:08:00.020]  I think was eight point one point one that only affected iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus if you use the Delta file update over the
[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:02.020]  Air the full install was fine
[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:06.820]  But that you know for a first-generation product the first time that happens. It's not
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:11.780]  Even though that was terrible. It would be even worse if that happened to the watch with the first update, right?
[02:08:11.780 --> 02:08:16.100]  Because the first one is the one where the press would you know be able to jump on it and say, you know
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:21.520]  First up first watch update bricks watches and yeah, it's like that's that's not a good headline
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:25.860]  Yeah, especially because you don't have as much access to the watch even that you have to an iPhone
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:31.020]  I don't know what people would do to start troubleshooting that I think they would I think it's I think a bricked OS on the
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:36.140]  Phone aren't on the watch has to go to store. I don't think there's any way around it
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:40.020]  I really don't because with iOS with my iPhone 6 plus
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:43.960]  I just plugged it into iTunes and resort to the previous version and ended up full upgrade and it was fine
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:46.140]  But I can't do that with an Apple watch, right?
[02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:53.060]  Because I don't see how if it gets bricked and during an OS update how they otherwise they would still have to have some kind
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:55.060]  of working Bluetooth
[02:08:55.340 --> 02:09:01.580]  Or Wi-Fi, I don't know one or the other that the that the phone app could still detect it and do it over the air
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.340]  But I don't know that that's possible
[02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:08.860]  The Apple TV it's still got the micro USB port and you can plug it into iTunes if you really have to but the port
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:12.960]  On the Apple watch is sealed away. Yeah the port on the Apple and it's definitely yeah
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.340]  That's a seal that is you know, technically if you want to and there's videos out there of how you can do it
[02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:20.820]  But there's no way that that's ever a troubleshooting step for the customers
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:25.260]  It might be what they do at the store, but it's definitely not ever user-exposable
[02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:29.700]  Right
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:34.140]  And even now they can't and people can't get their hands on them close enough
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:39.460]  It's amazing. Like our watches just ship but I think like you still can't just order a modern buckle
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:43.820]  For example off apple.com. It still says not available, right? No, I still I keep here in July
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:50.660]  Yeah, so last thing I have on my list is that you and I the watches that you and I both ordered for our personal
[02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:57.460]  Watches both arrived right around the same time about a week and a half ago the space black link bracelet. I
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:01.580]  Love it. I I do I I'm very happy with it
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:06.100]  I was torn between this one and the stainless the regular stainless and
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:12.260]  That's the one I got for my review unit. And so having worn both. I'm definitely glad that I got this one
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:17.840]  But it was just something about the black and the way that Apple does
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:22.760]  Manufacturing and I understand why some people would think that the gold might be the height of whatever the Johnny
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:27.460]  I've Mark Newsome powers are with the watch but for me this was always the most attractive
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.220]  Version just because it's stainless steel. It's DLC
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:35.580]  There's so many things going on with it and the look I think you're the one who said that it changed slightly between September
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:39.480]  And March I I I'm convinced it did I cannot prove it. I
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.260]  Also felt I was in the store
[02:10:43.100 --> 02:10:49.060]  Yesterday or the day before with my son. He had a hardware problem with his MacBook
[02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:56.420]  And so while we were there we were looking at the watches to my eyes now the the one in the store is lower
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:59.340]  It's under glass and so the lighting could be different
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:06.220]  But to me the demo unit that they have in the store under the glass display looked slightly lighter than mine
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:13.100]  It looked theirs look more like dark gray and mine looks more like black, but I thought the ones in September definitely looked more like
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:17.980]  Darker gray metal and not black, but I could be misremembering
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:20.460]  No, I think I have a photo and now looking at it
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:24.700]  I can't tell if it's the silver or the black one because and I was sure it was a black one
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:26.700]  But it looks so light compared to this one
[02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.780]  Sammy that you have it. Is that from I'm or I
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:32.220]  Just took an Instagram back
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:36.420]  We went to the September event and I went back to look at it and it just looked so light
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:41.300]  Compared to what I have now and it made me doubt whether it was actually the black watch. That's like a photo of yeah
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.300]  I that's what I remember thinking in
[02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:49.380]  I remember again I could be wrong and maybe I was just looking at two stainless steel ones, but I remember in September
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:57.140]  Looking at the in the press area and thinking I don't understand why they made both of these because they look almost
[02:11:57.740 --> 02:12:03.900]  Indistinguishable they're calling this one stainless in this one space black stainless and they look like the same thing to me
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:10.860]  Whereas the one that's wearing is on my wrist is truly black. It's as black as the display
[02:12:10.860 --> 02:12:14.020]  It's like what do you call blacked out? I think in a watch, right?
[02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:17.980]  And the DLC to me the diamond like coating that they use is just terrific
[02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:21.420]  I've been wearing it non-stop for we can have it still looks like I took it out the box
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:28.500]  Yeah, that's actually true for me too. Whereas the regular stainless definitely developed scratches on the bracelet, you know within a day or two
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:34.960]  Which is normal I should say for a stainless steel like my you know, my own stainless steel watch, you know
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:38.860]  You just get scratches. It's you know, if you look closely at it, you know
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:43.900]  And whereas this DLC coating really does seem to be keeping it in in like out-of-the-box condition
[02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:54.740]  It really is a weird thing to talk about like we talked to you and I talked about this just personally
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.300]  But it to the touch it has it feels hard like metal
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:04.600]  But it has like almost a rubbery texture like a non porous texture. Yeah
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:09.800]  It's like kryptonian or something. I don't have a definition for it. Yeah, I have to say I really like it
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:13.800]  But I ordered it first thing first thing
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:19.400]  Seconds after the store went live and it didn't show up until a week and a half ago. So that was a long time
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:25.200]  Yeah, I think this I think was one of the last models to actually ship
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.160]  Yeah, I think ship last week. Yeah
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:31.480]  Do you know anybody who got an addition? Have you seen it?
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.680]  Uh, there was a guy that kid in China who put two of them on his dog. I
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.720]  saw that
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:40.720]  Jonathan Geller. Yeah, John Geller the
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:44.960]  Boy genius report got one. Yeah, it looks really nice. I
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.200]  Don't know if it's out of turn but on last week's show Dan Fromer and I were talking about how we hadn't
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:57.120]  How we hadn't seen any in the wild and
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:03.380]  And then after we published the show is when it seemed like they first started shipping and
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:12.380]  Dan
[02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:13.260]  Alerted me to it
[02:14:13.260 --> 02:14:19.660]  That was the first I'd seen that Jonathan Geller had gotten his gold Apple watch and his DM to me
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:24.100]  Dan Fromer said boy genius wins the golden turd award. I
[02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:26.100]  I
[02:14:26.580 --> 02:14:29.540]  Don't blame the kid if you got the money go ahead and get it have fun with it
[02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:31.540]  I don't blame anybody who wants to spend the money on it
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:35.960]  Yeah, I think he just got married last week or the week before and I think both he and his new bride got them
[02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:38.060]  Well good for them
[02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:43.260]  That's good somebody did a
[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:48.580]  Listener also texted me that they saw somebody in Grand Central with the rose gold
[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:54.220]  I forget what band might have been a sport band but a rose gold one with a sport band. So
[02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:57.900]  You know, they're definitely starting to ship and I think you know
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.940]  Obviously places like New York City and stuff like that or where you're gonna see him
[02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:07.420]  when I was at the I went to the try-ons at the store in Palo Alto and I went for lunch afterwards and there was
[02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:09.380]  Just a group of people sitting around
[02:15:09.380 --> 02:15:13.140]  At one of the tables and they were talking about which version of the edition they were going to get
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:16.100]  It wasn't a question about which watch it was like the rose gold
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:20.460]  No, the yellow gold with this buckle and that was just their version of the conversation, huh? Interesting
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:28.300]  So I'm sure for some people again, it's like, you know people who get $25,000 plane tickets to Singapore or who get $20,000
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:34.780]  Oh couture dresses or right five six or seven star hotel rooms. It's just that's the option that they're gonna choose. Yeah
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:39.300]  No, I guess not
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:43.220]  Anything else that you wanted to talk about before we wrap up the show? I think you did a good job
[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:47.020]  All right. It's been a busy week. I will see you soon, right?
[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:50.020]  all right, cuz I guess I should say because
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:55.140]  The questions about my I am free to fly. I've been free to fly for over a month. So I'm
[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:58.820]  Invited to and we'll be at
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:00.100]  WWDC
[02:16:00.100 --> 02:16:06.020]  Likewise be fun. Did they do they didn't do invitations this year? Like they'd know you I just got a phone call
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:10.900]  Yeah, I think some some people on Twitter tried to say they did but then when I tracked it down
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:17.380]  I didn't I couldn't find anybody that actually gotten the traditional invitation right because I and to my knowledge so nobody has like no
[02:16:17.380 --> 02:16:19.380]  we don't get to do the
[02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:25.340]  The Kremlin ology of trying to read into the invitation design what the topics are going to be
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:30.300]  Yeah, but I think they would have probably just used that logo that they made for WWDC. Anyway, right did that right?
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:34.060]  So it doesn't I just go to Dalrymple site and if he doesn't have a picture there. I see him. There's no yeah
[02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:36.060]  I just figured nobody got one

[02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:13.980]  Debug live a few minutes ago and it's with guy and Paul kafasis. Oh, and they have nothing to talk about for about three hours
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:15.820]  Where was that from?
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:21.660]  That's on debug and it's no but where was it recorded live? Oh, we just recorded on Skype. Oh, I gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha
[02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:25.820]  Okay, it's funny because we did the podcast at all and after an hour
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:28.260]  it felt like forever and they talked to Horace Dedia and
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:34.180]  I'm Steve rotten Smith and it just an hour felt like an eternity three hours with Paul on Skype felt like half an hour
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:39.240]  Yeah, no, that's always the case when you're on stage. You feel it, you know in a sense that you don't live
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:44.580]  So Paul kafasis never heard of them sounds like an interesting go-getter. Yeah
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:47.420]  And
