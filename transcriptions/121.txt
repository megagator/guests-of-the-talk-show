[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  I don't even know where to start. What do you want to start with?
[00:03.000 --> 00:04.000]  Johnny I
[00:04.000 --> 00:05.000]  Johnny I've
[00:05.000 --> 00:10.100]  I guess that's probably historically the biggest news of the week. So we could just talk about our new black watches
[00:14.100 --> 00:18.900]  So Monday Memorial Day U.S. holiday
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  I was just I
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  I so did not know what to make sense of this when it hit a story came out in the telegraph in
[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  the United Kingdom
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.500]  written by Stephen Fry who
[00:36.600 --> 00:44.000]  Though I don't I have some complaints about the article. It is a wonderful, you know, one of the world's most beloved
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.100]  Figures, I mean he's a comedian actor writer long-time Apple fan
[00:50.100 --> 00:56.100]  wrote a profile and I guess you'd call it a profile. I don't know. Even the headline is weird
[00:56.100 --> 01:05.100]  It's the headline is when Stephen Fry met Johnny Ive the self-confessed tech geek talks to Apple's new lead promoted chief design officer
[01:07.100 --> 01:13.100]  In an exclusive interview in which I've's promotion is revealed for the first time Stephen Fry meets Johnny Ive and his boss
[01:13.100 --> 01:17.300]  Apple chief executive Tim Cook to talk spaceships design and Steve Jobs
[01:17.300 --> 01:21.300]  And so you know
[01:23.300 --> 01:28.600]  So part of the news it's it's sort of a first-person account of hanging out with Johnny Ive and Tim Cook
[01:28.600 --> 01:35.300]  which in and of itself is interesting, but to me the and the part that's just odd to me is that this this is how Apple chose to
[01:36.300 --> 01:38.300]  unveil the
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  What would you call it the
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.200]  Executive change which is that Johnny Ive has been promoted from senior vice president of design to chief design officer
[01:47.200 --> 01:49.200]  and two of his lieutenants
[01:49.700 --> 01:51.700]  Richard whole worth and
[01:52.700 --> 02:00.200]  Allen die have been promoted to new titles vice president whole worth is vice president of industrial design and
[02:02.700 --> 02:04.700]  Allen
[02:04.700 --> 02:09.300]  Excuse me. Sorry about that Allen die has been promoted to vice president of UI design
[02:09.300 --> 02:17.300]  Yeah, it's it's super interesting because Richard Haworth has been working with Johnny Ive for a long time in the industrial design department
[02:17.300 --> 02:23.100]  They're they're very close in the team very involved team and Allen die came over
[02:23.400 --> 02:30.000]  With iOS 7 which is just a couple of years and it's I mean it's a super fascinating topic to talk about because the dynamic of
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.500]  ID is that they all did work together for so long and we're so used to collaborating but with
[02:34.500 --> 02:38.500]  H.I. Johnny I was new to it and he needed someone who was a strong
[02:39.500 --> 02:43.500]  Collaborator in UI, but he didn't go with any of the traditional like Greg Christie
[02:44.500 --> 02:51.100]  Team he went with Allen die for marketing and then had to collaborate because he doesn't drop pixels as far as I know
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  Yeah, great Christie is an interesting
[02:54.000 --> 02:57.780]  Yeah, I don't I that's one of the reasons I wanted to have you on talk about this because I feel like you're a little
[02:57.780 --> 03:04.180]  Just in your your at least your mental role edex is a little bit more up to date than mine on some of the names and stuff like that
[03:04.180 --> 03:06.180]  But great Christie is a great example like
[03:06.900 --> 03:12.280]  Where I mean, I don't remember what his title was, but I remember go certainly it by a lot
[03:12.700 --> 03:17.540]  They don't tell you one of the weird things about WWDC is that they don't tell you who's presenting
[03:19.500 --> 03:25.860]  Until you go to the session or until you start playing the session and there is a credit that tells you who it is who's talking to you
[03:25.860 --> 03:27.860]  but in advance they don't tell you and
[03:28.660 --> 03:36.020]  Sometimes who is giving the presentation is actually more of an indication as to what the subject is going to be then this then the title of the session
[03:36.260 --> 03:38.660]  Absolutely, I think I lost saw Greg Christie
[03:38.660 --> 03:39.580]  I don't know if you did anything last year
[03:39.580 --> 03:43.460]  But I saw him do the big presentation on how they designed photos for iOS a couple years ago
[03:43.700 --> 03:49.420]  Yes, I remember that one right and it just because it just so happened that you know the user interface stuff was always more
[03:49.420 --> 03:56.060]  interesting to me and always a little bit more you know up my in my wheelhouse as as one might say I
[03:57.820 --> 03:59.820]  Almost said in my wheelbarrow
[04:00.380 --> 04:07.100]  In my wheelhouse as one would say I wound up in Greg's Christie led sessions many times over the years
[04:07.100 --> 04:11.820]  I think I seem to recall a long time ago. There was even like one that was more like a panel discussion
[04:13.020 --> 04:15.580]  Like stuff that they don't really do with WWDC anymore
[04:15.580 --> 04:21.740]  But yeah, that was but great Christie was from back in the day when there was like a general H.I. team
[04:21.980 --> 04:25.740]  Yeah, that was sort of I guess really just reported jobs
[04:27.340 --> 04:31.620]  Doesn't didn't really have wasn't really part of any kind of chain
[04:32.140 --> 04:37.340]  Yeah, as far as I mean H.I. was always sort of elevated at Apple beyond where they would have been like maybe another company
[04:37.340 --> 04:42.620]  That would have been slaughtered in under some VP of some software products division somewhere, right?
[04:42.620 --> 04:51.340]  But you know and as I've sort of written that it just dipping my toes in part of this is that
[04:51.980 --> 04:58.220]  One of the reasons Johnny I've wanted to bring user interface design and under his design team some Brella is
[04:59.020 --> 05:02.940]  That he wasn't exactly happy with all of the with the direction that
[05:03.740 --> 05:07.260]  Interface design had gone at Apple in recent years or in the years prior
[05:07.260 --> 05:12.860]  I mean because obviously it was a change. I mean there's no I mean whether you love the Iowa 7 and Yosemite
[05:13.420 --> 05:16.700]  looks or whether you don't like them or whether you're ambivalent about them
[05:16.700 --> 05:20.460]  Nobody can deny that there was a shift in in aesthetics
[05:21.260 --> 05:23.980]  Absolutely and that I mean I think it feels like Scott Forrest look
[05:23.980 --> 05:25.020]  It's blamed for a lot of that
[05:25.020 --> 05:31.580]  But you know it was Steve Jobs's airplane that had the famous stitch leather texture that you wanted and he was a big proponent of that sort of
[05:31.580 --> 05:38.140]  Affordance and Greg Christie and I'm blanking on the gentleman's last name Bass who testified on all the Samsung lawsuits
[05:38.140 --> 05:44.700]  And then subsequently left Apple they were intimately involved in the early years of the iPhone design that whole team and that whole focus
[05:44.940 --> 05:47.340]  And he really did feel like he wanted something new when he came in
[05:47.900 --> 05:49.100]  Right
[05:49.420 --> 05:54.220]  And you know Alan dies from a you know came from as an Apple terms Markham
[05:55.420 --> 05:59.260]  Which I don't does that widespread the industry. I always thought that was sort of an Appleism
[05:59.260 --> 06:03.580]  No, I used to work in where comp so for me. It's always been normal and enterprise
[06:04.140 --> 06:08.140]  And I think you and I both worked in in print design for a while
[06:08.940 --> 06:13.260]  And I always found that sort of background and I know like Mark Edwards did that to and I always found that sort of background
[06:13.260 --> 06:16.300]  Really educational when you started moving into digital design
[06:17.020 --> 06:18.140]  Yeah
[06:18.140 --> 06:20.700]  And anyway, Greg Christie left Apple
[06:22.220 --> 06:24.220]  Not immediately but
[06:24.220 --> 06:32.940]  He left in their panzerino story from April 9th 2014 veteran designer Greg Christie to parts and I don't know that it's as simple
[06:32.940 --> 06:34.940]  I don't know the story there, but you know
[06:35.660 --> 06:37.660]  Whether it was it you know
[06:37.980 --> 06:40.620]  Just well you picked him instead of me then I'm out, you know
[06:40.620 --> 06:42.300]  I don't know or if it was just you know
[06:42.300 --> 06:45.100]  But Christie had been there for a long time and it's you know
[06:45.260 --> 06:48.860]  Maybe you know you could just put his finger in the wind and tell it was time to go
[06:48.860 --> 06:52.060]  But yes, and there was definitely it was not exactly universally
[06:52.060 --> 06:55.660]  Seen as the right decision within Apple
[06:56.060 --> 06:57.100]  Well, I think that's absolutely true
[06:57.100 --> 06:59.980]  And I think you said that really well and there was a joke around the time that you know
[06:59.980 --> 07:01.980]  We mentioned it was going to hate the direction right?
[07:01.980 --> 07:02.700]  Oh yes
[07:02.700 --> 07:08.220]  Yeah, but there's a lot of people who fell into that camp of liking rich textures and rich designs
[07:08.300 --> 07:13.980]  And they they had to be on board at minor standing as there was a really big meeting with this whole direction was announced
[07:13.980 --> 07:17.980]  And not everybody was happy with it, but at the same time you have people like
[07:17.980 --> 07:25.340]  Great Christie and you have people like Henri Lamara who literally did forced marathons marathons of sprints for years and years and years
[07:25.340 --> 07:27.980]  And I think there comes to a point where you just you need to stop
[07:28.780 --> 07:30.780]  Especially if you're at that intense level of doing
[07:31.340 --> 07:33.340]  iOS and a yearly grind schedule
[07:33.340 --> 07:35.340]  Yeah
[07:37.820 --> 07:44.060]  Yeah, so I think bottom line is because a whole earth is you know industrial design has been under Johnny's group
[07:44.060 --> 07:50.060]  I mean that was in fact that was Johnny's group. I think yes in the old days Johnny's group really was just industrial design
[07:52.220 --> 07:55.740]  And whole earth has been part of that and clearly you know
[07:56.220 --> 08:02.060]  Johnny trusts him and they've gotten along and that whole group has by all accounts that I've ever read has always been very
[08:02.140 --> 08:04.140]  Tighten it and has gotten along
[08:04.300 --> 08:09.500]  Extremely well that there's it's not just that they do good work, but that there's a true camaraderie
[08:10.140 --> 08:12.300]  I think that's been part of the secret of keeping
[08:12.300 --> 08:18.940]  Because a lot of creative people they don't go very long-term bill waters and famously retired from Calvin and Hobbes and some people like George Lucas
[08:18.940 --> 08:20.140]  They end up making prequels
[08:20.140 --> 08:24.220]  Which is not the best of their work and I think the relationship that ID group had
[08:25.100 --> 08:31.460]  When Steve Jobs came back to Apple they were off somewhere in the Boonies and he brought them to IL2 and set them up and made them so important
[08:31.460 --> 08:35.660]  But that group seems to have sort of kept them all fed and energized in a lie for many many years
[08:36.140 --> 08:40.780]  Right, it's you know, it's the holiest of holies. Yes, you know the inner sanctum
[08:40.780 --> 08:44.060]  I mean, that's like the that is the center of
[08:44.780 --> 08:50.060]  Infinite loop is that their design lab. I mean, maybe not that's not the physical center obviously, but it's the
[08:50.940 --> 08:56.140]  You know, it's the place that the least fewest number of people have ever seen. Yeah, very few key cards going to access their own
[08:56.620 --> 08:58.620]  right
[08:59.020 --> 09:00.540]  but
[09:00.540 --> 09:06.060]  It you know prior to the shake-up where where you know forced all was was ousted and
[09:06.060 --> 09:12.300]  And you I design was placed under Johnny I've in that group prior to that there were
[09:12.620 --> 09:16.540]  H I there were people who there was like an H I group, but then there were also like
[09:17.900 --> 09:21.900]  It was spread about where somebody might go off on a team and then they were you know
[09:21.900 --> 09:27.660]  Like I for example like with I think with the original iPhone and you correct me if I'm wrong because I could I could very much be wrong on
[09:27.660 --> 09:32.860]  This as a basic story, but the basic gist was when they committed to doing the iPhone
[09:32.860 --> 09:37.660]  for stall was placed in charge of the software and
[09:38.620 --> 09:45.020]  For stall went around the company cherry picking designers who he wanted and would you know
[09:45.500 --> 09:47.100]  Say I mean, this is this part is true
[09:47.100 --> 09:52.780]  I don't know if he did it to everybody, but at least for some people it was I'm putting together a team to do something and
[09:53.580 --> 09:56.300]  It's gonna be the greatest thing in your career
[09:56.300 --> 10:01.020]  And I cannot tell you what it is, but if you want to join, you know, you'll work harder than you ever have
[10:01.020 --> 10:05.740]  But it's gonna be great. You're are you in or out? And if they said they're in then they were on the team
[10:05.740 --> 10:07.980]  But then it wasn't like there was this one
[10:09.100 --> 10:11.100]  interface group that
[10:11.100 --> 10:17.100]  Part of what they did is put together an iPhone team the iPhone team had its own interface group cherry pick from around the company
[10:18.220 --> 10:20.300]  And that it was like that with other projects too
[10:20.620 --> 10:25.180]  Maybe to a lesser degree because the iPhone was you know a major major endeavor
[10:25.180 --> 10:31.100]  Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely true, and I think Nganatra on debug was talking about how they had to all be
[10:31.740 --> 10:35.180]  Disclosed by Steve Jobs and when he wasn't around he would have to go into one room
[10:35.580 --> 10:39.980]  Look at the designs and then walk out to the undisclosed designers and sort of describe to them what they had to do
[10:42.380 --> 10:44.380]  Which is it makes sense
[10:44.460 --> 10:50.060]  I could see how it makes sense to Steve Jobs and it makes you know and that obviously worked out for Apple to some degree
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.060]  but obviously was not a very
[10:52.060 --> 10:56.620]  There was an ad hoc nature to use your interface design to software design
[10:57.500 --> 11:04.140]  Yeah, absolutely and they had limited design resources and they had to be shared and pooled and it sounds like a really grueling project to get out
[11:04.620 --> 11:06.620]  Right, and on the one side. I think you could argue
[11:07.180 --> 11:12.140]  You know, and maybe but you know, it's one of those things where it doesn't have to be either or they're not necessarily mutually exclusive
[11:12.140 --> 11:15.180]  On the one side you could say that what Johnny I've did orchestrated
[11:15.900 --> 11:17.020]  in 2011 with
[11:17.020 --> 11:23.420]  Forced all going out and all of you I designed being placed under him and picking new people to run it
[11:24.220 --> 11:30.460]  And setting a new style you could say that it was a power grab that it was an expansion of just you know
[11:30.620 --> 11:37.820]  Just ego and an expansion of his power, but in it I think in a very reasonable sense you could say it was a
[11:38.460 --> 11:40.460]  Growing up like it it made
[11:41.420 --> 11:44.780]  The process of UI design much more orderly within Apple
[11:44.780 --> 11:49.900]  Because it wasn't spread about where each individual project might peel off its own team
[11:50.540 --> 11:55.100]  Yeah, I think that's absolutely true and the thing that's interesting to me is a Scott Forselk was widely known as
[11:55.340 --> 12:00.780]  I don't know how widely now, but it was known that if Steve Jobs had I went leather for this if Scott Forselk wasn't around
[12:01.180 --> 12:06.780]  The designer would almost lose his mind because it would just be no no no no no and he'd burn through 40 50 100 different designs
[12:07.020 --> 12:13.500]  But if Scott was there he could say Steve will pick one of these three and Steve would pick one of those three and that saved everyone a tremendous
[12:13.500 --> 12:19.740]  I'm out of work, but in an apple where there's no Steve Jobs the value of that for h. I is is or the combination
[12:19.740 --> 12:23.820]  The alchemy of that is very different and then you have at the same time someone like Johnny
[12:23.820 --> 12:28.220]  I've sitting in the wings who was on the record he'd said before he didn't like the ski more thick design
[12:28.780 --> 12:35.020]  One of the arguably the best designer in the world who's not allowed to take control or do to influence to put his tastes on
[12:35.180 --> 12:42.060]  The software that runs on his hardware and then Tim Cook comes in and it always reminded me of what Steve Jobs did when he returned to Apple when he said
[12:42.060 --> 12:48.140]  Desktop laptop professional consumer and he came in and he just said design services
[12:49.100 --> 12:52.300]  Hardware and software and he made Apple very clean that way
[12:52.780 --> 12:56.060]  Hmm in a way that it didn't need to be under jobs and again
[12:56.060 --> 12:58.460]  I think that emphasizes that part of what made Forselk
[12:59.420 --> 13:06.180]  Talented and essential and so it was so important to the history of you know, especially iOS, you know, you know the iPhone and iPad
[13:06.180 --> 13:11.860]  Wasn't just that he was good manager and by all accounts
[13:11.860 --> 13:17.540]  He was that he shipped OSes on time and there, you know, some people would argue they were more reliable
[13:18.420 --> 13:20.420]  Etc
[13:21.460 --> 13:28.740]  But an uncanny ability he seemed to have is that he seemed it wasn't just that he had good taste
[13:28.820 --> 13:32.260]  It was that he knew Steve's taste and that his you know
[13:32.260 --> 13:37.860]  And there one of the profiles was something that was written one of the pieces that was written about Forselk was it's
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.740]  You know, I might have been an unnamed person who was complaining that like
[13:41.380 --> 13:47.460]  You know, they'd present stuff to Forselk and Forselk would say Steve wouldn't like that and then that was all he had to do is say
[13:47.460 --> 13:52.540]  Steve wouldn't like it and that's enough to bounce you back to the drawing board and that it got tiresome over the time
[13:52.540 --> 14:01.020]  But I think it the fact that he lasted so long as a direct report to Steve Jobs in that role shows that he was right
[14:01.020 --> 14:08.140]  That he knew what he would like and what he wouldn't like and that in a company where you have some like Steve Jobs
[14:08.140 --> 14:13.780]  That's an essential skill to get anything done because and we've both heard the story is like make that blue more beautiful
[14:13.780 --> 14:20.140]  That that can burn hours and weeks from a designer and if you can shortcut that process with someone like Scott Forselk in the middle
[14:20.140 --> 14:21.340]  That's immensely valuable
[14:21.340 --> 14:31.460]  Right because you couldn't just it wasn't like you were going to get a chance at 10 a.m. On a Tuesday when he says you know
[14:31.540 --> 14:33.060]  No, that's not good enough
[14:33.060 --> 14:37.100]  You don't get a chance at 10 a.m. The next day to also present to him
[14:37.100 --> 14:43.300]  You've got a weight you might be stuck waiting a week or longer before you get your next chance to to get your project in front of him
[14:43.420 --> 14:46.540]  Yeah, or if there's something that's worth fighting for and you've been stories
[14:46.540 --> 14:48.500]  You're like like iTunes on Windows was a great example
[14:48.500 --> 14:51.620]  But there's a lot of smaller examples caught with somebody who could go back to steam and say look
[14:51.620 --> 14:56.220]  I really think we should take another look at this and then projects that might have otherwise been derailed in a few minutes
[14:57.060 --> 15:03.740]  Sometimes we could only get back on track right so and rather than just merely and being an arbiter of good taste being an
[15:03.740 --> 15:05.740]  arbiter of Steve Jobs's
[15:06.540 --> 15:09.380]  Good taste was essential and
[15:10.580 --> 15:12.580]  I think you know
[15:12.580 --> 15:19.480]  In hindsight clearly not very valuable to Apple after Steve Jobs wasn't there because Tim Cook doesn't some cooks
[15:19.480 --> 15:23.380]  He's not Steve Jobs, so he doesn't need that service in Johnny. I bet he's
[15:23.860 --> 15:26.780]  He has peerless taste of his own, so he doesn't need that service as well
[15:27.100 --> 15:32.340]  Right different days. Yeah, and it does make you wonder in hindsight what some of cuz I've and and and
[15:32.580 --> 15:40.740]  You know Steve Jobs famously, you know, we're actually friends more than just collaborators and ate lunch together all the time and it makes you wonder how much
[15:40.740 --> 15:49.700]  Feedback Johnny had given him over the years, you know, that was obviously rejected in terms of trying to steer the user interface in
[15:49.820 --> 15:51.820]  a direction more palatable to himself
[15:52.540 --> 15:57.980]  Without actually having any kind of actual role in it. I think something you said a couple of years ago
[15:57.980 --> 16:03.940]  It was really astute there because the age before retina and especially when mobile devices were really new swipe to unlock
[16:03.940 --> 16:07.740]  Nobody knew what that was so making a giant groove in there and making a very elaborate button
[16:07.740 --> 16:11.540]  It gave you that affordance that visual clue of how you had to use that
[16:11.540 --> 16:14.460]  And or Steve would say, you know, this is a database app
[16:14.460 --> 16:17.860]  I know one cares about that give it a texture and that sounds dumb
[16:17.860 --> 16:21.940]  But if you're stumbling home tired or drunk and you open up an app and you're in contacts
[16:21.940 --> 16:26.780]  And there's no there's nothing to tell you which contacts it is maybe you're trying to call a cab in game center
[16:26.780 --> 16:32.060]  And you just you just don't know so there were a lot of usability reasons and just philosophical reasons
[16:32.060 --> 16:38.220]  Why I think that started off but then as you transition to retina that sort of texture doesn't hold up anymore? Yeah
[16:38.220 --> 16:41.500]  I think it's a combination. I emphasized that my years ago
[16:41.500 --> 16:47.500]  My thought was a lot more about the retina non-retna and that you needed the other thing was in addition to just the
[16:47.500 --> 16:55.340]  affordances of knowing what to do and having that slide to unlock which is you know to me like just put that design
[16:55.340 --> 17:02.060]  It's self not even the whole iPhone, but just put that slide to unlock itself put that in a museum because that is
[17:04.100 --> 17:07.300]  It it it made people
[17:07.780 --> 17:12.460]  Wow people wanted to buy the phone just from slide to unlock and it taught you how to use it right?
[17:14.540 --> 17:20.980]  I've my thought a couple of years ago was simply about the fact that even at 163 pixels per inch
[17:20.980 --> 17:23.540]  Which was pretty high for the time in 2007
[17:23.540 --> 17:30.820]  It still wasn't that high. It was only high compared to the hundred and twenty to hundred and thirty-ish pixels
[17:30.820 --> 17:32.820]  Prince we had on our max at the time
[17:33.220 --> 17:36.980]  that you needed to use those sort of photo shop style
[17:37.700 --> 17:43.940]  User interface designs just to make it look good so that as soon as you looked at it you thought oh that looks cool
[17:44.780 --> 17:50.340]  Because something like iOS 7 you just doesn't look that great on
[17:50.340 --> 17:52.900]  Non retina. There's nothing about it that makes you go wow
[17:54.140 --> 17:59.780]  But I think that the affordance stuff was important too because I think the basic idea with the original iPhone
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.300]  Was that I?
[18:03.300 --> 18:06.220]  Steve Jobs used the analogy when he introduced it that
[18:08.620 --> 18:12.460]  Here's all these other phones of the time and look what they've got they've got all these buttons
[18:12.500 --> 18:14.860]  But here's the thing about all these hardware buttons
[18:14.860 --> 18:20.260]  It reduces the amount of space you have now the screens only this big and then number two a year
[18:20.260 --> 18:23.380]  From now if we come up with this great idea for a new feature
[18:23.620 --> 18:26.540]  We're stuck with the buttons. We had already come up with a year ago
[18:26.540 --> 18:28.900]  And that we've solved this problem years and years ago
[18:28.900 --> 18:36.060]  It's called a bitmap screen and then you can make all the buttons you want whenever you want and only have the buttons that you need right now on
[18:36.060 --> 18:41.980]  Screen so we'll do the whole thing. We'll just be a screen and we'll make the buttons in software
[18:42.340 --> 18:46.940]  But I think that the basic idea was make the buttons look like fake hardware and
[18:46.940 --> 18:51.900]  And that in every single app, it's like a dedicated device
[18:52.500 --> 18:55.140]  Simulating the dedicated hardware device for that feature
[18:55.740 --> 19:00.180]  Yeah, and the broad calculator is maybe a famous example of that. It's people
[19:00.180 --> 19:04.820]  The thought was that people wouldn't know how to approach just a blank piece of glass and if you made it look like something
[19:04.820 --> 19:08.460]  They were familiar with it at least they'd start tapping around and then discover how it worked
[19:09.060 --> 19:15.060]  Right or the the call recorder. Yes, I know that wasn't in the first OS
[19:15.060 --> 19:17.940]  But you know certainly was in you know one of the early ones
[19:19.700 --> 19:21.700]  The compass is another one
[19:21.700 --> 19:28.060]  Real to reel in the podcast. That was probably the last big example of that. Right and even the ones that didn't have an in now
[19:28.060 --> 19:32.300]  You know something like mail which didn't really have like a a
[19:33.500 --> 19:40.900]  Brown-style, you know gadget that you could compare it to just the fact that there were these little 3d effects between the
[19:40.900 --> 19:48.980]  You know the keyboard in the content area. It just ever so gently suggested that this is what it would look like
[19:48.980 --> 19:53.620]  If you had a hardware device, that was just for email and the original at least the first versions
[19:53.620 --> 19:56.100]  They didn't composite anywhere nearly as well as later versions
[19:56.100 --> 20:01.820]  Which is why we didn't get wallpaper and I think iOS 3 or iOS 4 actually so they had a lot they had a lot fewer things
[20:01.820 --> 20:03.420]  They could do visually
[20:03.420 --> 20:06.060]  Right well the basic and that basic idea
[20:06.060 --> 20:14.780]  I always thought with the original home screen was to make it look like at the home screen level by having just a black wallpaper
[20:14.780 --> 20:20.660]  The idea was you've got this like device that is sort of like a calculator where each icon is a button
[20:20.940 --> 20:24.820]  You know, it's like this like a like a dial pad. But instead of having
[20:25.460 --> 20:29.580]  Numbers right like an old phone that phones that they were replacing
[20:30.100 --> 20:33.540]  the the basic interface was a you know
[20:33.540 --> 20:38.340]  One two three four five six seven eight nine and a zero
[20:39.020 --> 20:45.860]  Dialpad the dial pad on the iPhone was you know, these 11 apps. Yeah, that's a really good insight
[20:46.380 --> 20:47.260]  Absolutely
[20:47.260 --> 20:54.020]  It was also different than some competitive products when not initially but when for example Android would later put widgets on the home screen
[20:54.020 --> 20:58.140]  It always felt like Apple never wanted the home screen to be a destination just a gateway
[20:58.140 --> 21:05.500]  Right. It was just a dial pad where you dial up whichever app you needed the device to transform itself into yes, absolutely
[21:08.540 --> 21:11.020]  So I kind of you know we go back
[21:11.380 --> 21:16.060]  Dialing all the way back to this news about Johnny Ivan and Greg Christie or not Greg Christie
[21:16.060 --> 21:21.220]  But you know well and I own die and Richard her worth well, and you know guys like Christie leaving
[21:21.220 --> 21:33.140]  Yes, it turned UI design into something that works exactly like industrial design had always worked at Apple like and
[21:33.420 --> 21:38.740]  In theory, they could have done the same thing by not putting it under Johnny I've but just by picking somebody else like Greg
[21:38.740 --> 21:40.740]  Christie and setting up
[21:40.740 --> 21:44.500]  you I design as a separate peer to
[21:46.220 --> 21:50.300]  Industrial design right they could have named instead of putting it all under Johnny I
[21:50.300 --> 21:56.380]  They could have said Johnny you're still in charge of industrial design you design all the hardware and now we've named this guy
[21:57.180 --> 22:01.540]  Could have been great Christie could have been anybody else you are like the Johnny I've of
[22:02.340 --> 22:07.420]  UI design and you'll set up your own lab and you guys will design all the user interfaces
[22:07.420 --> 22:15.500]  Didn't have to be in one, but it you know, but I do think that either way it was the right way to go moving forward without jobs at the helm
[22:15.500 --> 22:20.200]  As CEO as somebody has to be in charge of the taste
[22:21.220 --> 22:23.220]  Something you know it had to be done
[22:23.500 --> 22:30.740]  Yeah, no, I think that's very astute and I think the you could see clearly that right away the big the first big project that came out was
[22:30.740 --> 22:34.380]  I OS 7 and when they did the advertising for the iPhone 5c
[22:34.940 --> 22:37.140]  They had better together as their slogan
[22:37.140 --> 22:42.420]  They wanted to show that the palettes matched over that the hardware in the software being together was an important thing for them
[22:42.420 --> 22:49.820]  And that's probably the only reason I obviously that had to been driven by Johnny I but that that was the benefit of putting all that stuff together
[22:50.300 --> 22:56.740]  Yeah, and I think the watch is the culmination of that because say what you want about the watch and what you know whether you like the
[22:58.500 --> 23:01.260]  You know where you think the watch stands in terms of you know
[23:01.260 --> 23:04.100]  Is it better than the original iPhone is it better than the original iPad?
[23:04.100 --> 23:06.180]  Whatever I don't think to me
[23:06.180 --> 23:13.700]  There's no doubt that the hardware and software integration are tighter with the watch than any any other device and
[23:14.740 --> 23:17.620]  Talking about UI design in particular that the UI
[23:18.340 --> 23:21.700]  Just doesn't make any sense except in the context of this watch
[23:22.580 --> 23:30.180]  Yeah, and it's it is something brand new and it's also a category where traditionally Apple had 10 years of smartphones to look at or 10 years of tablets of windows
[23:30.580 --> 23:33.540]  Tablet PC to look at watches were still very new. You had the pebble
[23:33.540 --> 23:36.420]  You had a couple Samsung watches, but you know those those came later
[23:36.420 --> 23:39.540]  Probably after Apple had to do a lot of their original concepts for the watch
[23:39.620 --> 23:45.860]  So it's a project where Apple had to not just identify problems and see like this we hate this because
[23:46.420 --> 23:52.500]  And they already loved watches, but they had to sort of figure out how to make the watch a computer and not just a digital mechanism anymore
[23:52.900 --> 23:53.980]  Yeah
[23:53.980 --> 23:58.100]  Famously, well, maybe not famous or maybe people don't know this but
[23:58.100 --> 24:07.020]  In the development of the original iPhone the four stalls software team didn't see the prototypes of the hardware
[24:07.540 --> 24:08.980]  They were developing you know
[24:08.980 --> 24:13.180]  They're like they knew the size of the screen and they knew obviously knew it was going to be a touch screen
[24:13.180 --> 24:18.300]  But they didn't get to see what the prototypes look like and which is a little bit less important
[24:18.300 --> 24:24.100]  I feel like the software team just knowing okay, it's a touch screen that is you know 320 by 480 and
[24:24.100 --> 24:31.820]  You know, it's gonna be a pizza glass, you know touch it them working blind on the hardware is a little bit less
[24:31.820 --> 24:37.420]  Meaningful than the fact that the hardware team didn't get to see the software like and you've you I know you know this
[24:37.420 --> 24:41.940]  There's then and maybe it was even on eBay. We're like a prototype got out like there was this like
[24:42.580 --> 24:45.180]  Super janky looking pro you know like
[24:45.820 --> 24:47.820]  Stand in OS. Yes
[24:49.340 --> 24:51.340]  So ugly
[24:51.340 --> 24:54.740]  Because I the iPhone was originally purple, and I think that was Skank was the
[24:58.900 --> 25:03.740]  We should try to find the link out to this guy with Skank was like the code name for the the stand in OS
[25:03.740 --> 25:06.820]  I think I don't know if it's just a stand in OS where it's the it's the sort of the development
[25:07.180 --> 25:11.180]  That runs all the technical information that you need to grab from the electronics to do a lot of things
[25:13.140 --> 25:16.660]  Right it was sort of like a diagnostic OS, I guess you could say and
[25:16.660 --> 25:22.860]  And purposefully did not look good at all. It was you know made to look bad
[25:22.860 --> 25:25.580]  So that it wasn't like they lied to them and said hey
[25:25.580 --> 25:30.900]  This is the OS we're making they're like you guys don't get to see the OS make the hardware and here's this ugly
[25:31.140 --> 25:38.220]  Diagnostic OS where you can test to make sure that the you know Wi-Fi antenna is doing what the Wi-Fi antenna is supposed to do
[25:38.220 --> 25:41.100]  Etc. It's so forth. Yeah, and I think even some of the earlier prototypes
[25:41.100 --> 25:45.620]  We're just components, and I think this has been true for years even with iPads. They're just components literally
[25:45.620 --> 25:47.620]  Pulled it down on boards
[25:48.460 --> 25:50.460]  Yes, yeah, definitely
[25:51.340 --> 25:56.440]  Giver seat like the like the early iPod prototype. No
[25:57.300 --> 26:03.100]  It's yeah, it's really big and it you know clearly was never supposed to fool anybody in the thinking was the product, but it's
[26:04.340 --> 26:06.340]  Yeah, it's just like a bunch of
[26:06.980 --> 26:10.540]  Things on a board and there's a dial that you know that was the click wheel
[26:10.540 --> 26:14.140]  But it just looked like a nod you know off to the side that you had spin around
[26:14.140 --> 26:16.020]  Well, that's smart because if you have to wait for it
[26:16.020 --> 26:19.340]  I mean you you can't you can't have one follow the other you have to be doing both at the same time
[26:19.340 --> 26:21.340]  So you have to use them in some sort of development stage
[26:21.780 --> 26:23.780]  Right, but it's
[26:24.220 --> 26:29.340]  It seems very clear to me and I would be shocked to find out otherwise because it's with it
[26:29.340 --> 26:37.500]  You know was all one you know Johnny I've designed lab, but it's it seems very clear to me that the watch was developed with the software and the hardware
[26:38.140 --> 26:39.740]  at the same time
[26:39.740 --> 26:44.860]  And it seems even beyond that because the there is some siloing like you have Kevin Lynch in charge of the software not
[26:44.860 --> 26:51.100]  Craig Federigie, but it also seems like the people who do messaging for iOS or in touch with the people who doing it for the watch and
[26:51.100 --> 26:56.100]  And there's not sort of that strict divide that there used to be and that results and all the stuff working together
[26:56.300 --> 26:58.300]  Maybe not perfectly but very well
[26:58.580 --> 27:01.820]  Right, I do think I think Lynch reports to Federigie though
[27:02.660 --> 27:07.940]  But the idea was that you know rather than spread Federigie thinner than he is that you know
[27:07.940 --> 27:11.100]  They needed somebody who is just going to be you know
[27:11.820 --> 27:18.380]  You know, what would they I don't know if he was I don't know how there's the Apple term the DRI directly responsible individual
[27:18.380 --> 27:23.580]  But at least he I'd you know somebody has to be the DRI for the OS itself
[27:23.580 --> 27:27.900]  If not the design of the OS and he actual like it's all coded up
[27:27.900 --> 27:30.300]  You know, here's the build and the build is Rick
[27:30.300 --> 27:34.540]  You know, this is the 1.0 for Apple watch and that was Kevin Lynch
[27:34.540 --> 27:38.860]  Yeah, I think someone also and this was definitely Scott for so we really someone has to have that single active
[27:38.860 --> 27:43.100]  Will to birth something new and it's arguable whether this is the person should mature that product
[27:43.100 --> 27:47.740]  But you you really have to have that person who's only job it is to make that product launch right?
[27:48.060 --> 27:49.380]  so
[27:49.380 --> 27:55.900]  With the I've story I I have to admit I'm guilty as charge where I my first read through of the article was I
[27:56.340 --> 28:01.940]  Took a deep breath and thought. Oh, does is this the first step to him going out the door?
[28:01.940 --> 28:07.340]  And it's just like I wrote and it was like I read too much into it
[28:07.340 --> 28:09.900]  I think but that whole thing that he was going to travel more
[28:09.900 --> 28:15.060]  I really did read at first my first take and as I you know when I linked to an unterring fireball
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.980]  I thought that meant he might move back to England
[28:18.820 --> 28:26.860]  And a lot of that was based on my recollection of that of a 2011 story in the London Times that said that
[28:26.860 --> 28:33.660]  While negotiating a new contract with Apple I've wanted to put in you know be authorized to work from
[28:34.060 --> 28:35.260]  London
[28:35.260 --> 28:39.980]  Or wherever he would live in England and that you know Tim Cook and whoever else at Apple was like no
[28:39.980 --> 28:44.620]  You've got to stay here and that there was a source of conflict which in hindsight
[28:44.620 --> 28:50.340]  It was the only one report of it and then it seemed it's one of those things where it seems like there's there were a whole bunch of stories about it
[28:50.420 --> 28:56.580]  But every other story you can find about it is the London Times is reporting that blah blah blah
[28:56.580 --> 29:02.380]  Johnny I've wanted to move to England that there wasn't anybody else who said it their source for this was completely anonymous
[29:02.380 --> 29:04.380]  It certainly wasn't Johnny I
[29:04.380 --> 29:05.580]  and
[29:05.580 --> 29:11.540]  asking around over you know in the last week it seems to me like that story was bullshit and was sort of a source of
[29:12.860 --> 29:16.700]  Consternation at Apple at the time because they knew it was bullshit
[29:16.700 --> 29:17.660]  It was bullshit
[29:17.660 --> 29:23.060]  But they didn't want to say that it was bullshit just because they're Apple and they don't talk about such things
[29:23.060 --> 29:27.620]  Well, I had the same thought as you initially just it because it was a British paper. It was Steve and fraud
[29:27.620 --> 29:32.500]  It is I think that made of like of influence be but yeah, and not moving back necessarily
[29:32.500 --> 29:35.700]  But like if you were to spend the summers there right which is a couple months or three months
[29:35.700 --> 29:38.020]  That seemed perfectly logical to me given his new role
[29:39.100 --> 29:43.260]  Yeah, that's another factor in it the fact that it wasn't a UK paper
[29:45.380 --> 29:48.300]  The fact that it was you know wasn't announced in a press release
[29:48.300 --> 29:52.140]  I I forgot about
[29:53.580 --> 29:59.180]  And I've since linked to I linked to it yesterday on during fireable, but I forgot that in 2003
[29:59.580 --> 30:01.580]  Avi to manian
[30:01.580 --> 30:08.340]  Took up promotion whether you want to put quotes around it or not to a title chief software technology
[30:08.340 --> 30:13.340]  The
[30:13.340 --> 30:17.780]  Officer, I think CSTO. I forgot about that
[30:18.340 --> 30:22.580]  Even though I just reread the story of it in the becoming Steve Jobs
[30:22.860 --> 30:28.940]  Which but the thing that I had forgotten was that the title started with chief I just because somehow
[30:29.380 --> 30:31.420]  Like the four letter
[30:31.420 --> 30:39.580]  CSTO like if they had promoted him to chief technology officer just CTO I would have remembered that in a way that I didn't with
[30:39.580 --> 30:42.380]  Chief software technology officer like somehow
[30:43.420 --> 30:46.260]  That sounded ceremonial to me right away
[30:46.260 --> 30:51.020]  And then even the description of it in the press release were Apple announced it sounded a little bit
[30:51.020 --> 30:57.140]  It just really it almost seemed almost definite that it was sort of a stepping aside. It was like inventing a title for
[30:57.140 --> 31:02.500]  Yeah, so I kind of I should have remembered it, but I think in the back of my mind
[31:03.140 --> 31:07.220]  like subconsciously I did and that it also fueled my
[31:08.180 --> 31:14.300]  Because it was you know that was 2003 and that was when Bertrand Sirlette Sirlay Sirlette. Yeah, yeah
[31:16.340 --> 31:21.860]  I say Sirlette Sirlay Sirlette Sirlette Sirlay I'm gonna get wrong. All right, Sirlay Bertrand
[31:21.860 --> 31:28.380]  I just know this Bertrand everybody called him Bertrand so Bertrand got promoted to senior vice president of at software engineering and
[31:28.780 --> 31:30.780]  reported directly to Steve Jobs
[31:32.180 --> 31:35.940]  Which I really do think is sort of a key to the difference between
[31:36.340 --> 31:40.820]  Tivania and going to CSTO and Johnny I've going to chief design officer
[31:40.980 --> 31:48.500]  Where the people who are getting promoted underneath him to take more responsibility still report directly to I've not to
[31:48.500 --> 31:52.980]  Tim Cook or just somebody else with tovania and he was essentially not essential at that point
[31:52.980 --> 31:57.980]  Like Steve Jobs had a direct line of communication through a software stack and it made tovania and superfluous
[31:57.980 --> 32:04.060]  And that was not a position that Steve Jobs suffered lightly. Right and it's actually kind of an interesting
[32:04.740 --> 32:08.980]  Let me see if I can fish this up here. I have this saved somewhere. I hope
[32:11.660 --> 32:13.660]  Oh, maybe not
[32:13.660 --> 32:15.980]  the gist of it is as told in the
[32:15.980 --> 32:25.140]  Becoming Steve Jobs that it it wasn't necessarily that at the time that he immediately that tovania and really wanted to like they
[32:25.140 --> 32:26.380]  He's my way out the door
[32:26.380 --> 32:31.100]  He really just wanted to get away from the day-to-day stuff and kind of work on blue sky stuff
[32:32.260 --> 32:35.340]  But that it just did not work with the ways Steve Jobs
[32:37.780 --> 32:41.520]  Worked at the company. So here's the passage from becoming Steve Jobs
[32:41.520 --> 32:46.720]  It was unquestionably a promotion, but it turned out to be a job without much of a portfolio
[32:47.000 --> 32:53.920]  Tovania and found himself with little concrete responsibility. He felt out of the loop and realized that his new role would not work
[32:54.480 --> 33:01.720]  Quote being a pseudo individual staff person working for Steve doesn't work because he already has all the answers
[33:01.720 --> 33:06.400]  He didn't like it when I would be in a meeting where he was reviewing a product and I would have an opinion
[33:06.400 --> 33:09.480]  He just didn't like it and he grew to not like that
[33:09.480 --> 33:16.320]  I could be a senior person like that without having day-to-day responsibilities to deliver something. He says Tim Cook
[33:16.320 --> 33:23.280]  Now Apple CEO says that he worried about tovania and leaving an urge Steve in 2004 to figure out another challenge to keep the
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.280]  Brilliant software engineer at Apple
[33:25.280 --> 33:31.280]  Steve looked at me cook remembers and goes I agree. He's really smart, but he's decided he doesn't want to work
[33:31.560 --> 33:37.400]  I've never found in my whole life that you could convince someone who doesn't want to work hard to work hard
[33:37.400 --> 33:40.080]  Another in time. This is my favorite part of it
[33:41.560 --> 33:48.920]  Another time shortly after Steve had learned that tovania and it taken up golf Steve carped a cook that something was really a miss
[33:49.160 --> 33:52.840]  Golf he'd thundered incredulously. Who has time for golf?
[33:54.920 --> 33:58.080]  Golf he famously wouldn't even let people join boards of directors
[33:58.920 --> 34:00.920]  Should be too busy with Apple to do that
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.560]  Well, I've also heard that they used to when they used to have their off-sights
[34:04.560 --> 34:07.120]  He wouldn't let them have it anywhere where there was a golf course
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.120]  Yeah
[34:09.120 --> 34:17.520]  Sort of anti golf, which is which is interesting because in the article as strangely staged as it was they made sure to mention that Johnny
[34:17.520 --> 34:19.040]  I've still had
[34:19.040 --> 34:24.400]  Things on his plate to do like the store redesigns like campus to and other products
[34:24.880 --> 34:27.920]  Yeah, which is a huge difference, right, and it's
[34:30.000 --> 34:36.720]  You know, it just an enormously still I still think even with this and with these lieutenants taking over sort of direct
[34:36.720 --> 34:41.480]  Day-to-day responsibility for you are designed in industrial design. He still is spread pretty thin
[34:41.480 --> 34:47.080]  But I think he's spread a little bit less than by an administrative stuff. I think that's a that's a key thing
[34:47.080 --> 34:53.600]  We've seen recently too is that Apple if you look at what Eddie Q is responsible for that's that's almost an entire that is an entire company
[34:53.600 --> 34:55.560]  It's got its own marketing. It's got its own software development
[34:55.560 --> 34:59.000]  It's got it and they're bringing in people to sort of help him do that
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.040]  We've marketing is always been stretched really thin
[35:02.040 --> 35:06.240]  But they've got more people in there lately and it just seems like it's it's a little more sane
[35:06.240 --> 35:12.560]  Than it used to be and the responsibilities as they've grown the company didn't scale to account for that and the amount of work that the
[35:12.560 --> 35:17.240]  People at the top of those those organizations had to do was just becoming ludicrous. Yeah
[35:18.800 --> 35:21.440]  So I think I have since concluded
[35:21.440 --> 35:24.080]  You know, I mean who knows we'll see a couple years we'll let us know
[35:24.080 --> 35:31.040]  But I think that this actually is another one of those cases where as weird as the story was where it came out
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.680]  And it's I my guess is that weirdness was sort of this is the way Johnny wanted to do it and so okay
[35:36.680 --> 35:38.680]  This is how they did it
[35:39.320 --> 35:42.560]  That it really is what they say it is it's a promotion
[35:42.560 --> 35:49.360]  It's a recognition maybe it may be almost like a belated promotion where it's recognizing the authority he already wielded within the company
[35:50.360 --> 35:51.880]  And that he's not coming anywhere
[35:51.880 --> 35:57.400]  Well, that was the interesting thing because there was there was I think at least three discrete reactions to the news when it first came out
[35:57.400 --> 36:01.560]  One was that this was Johnny I putting one foot out the door, you know getting ready to wind down
[36:01.640 --> 36:06.400]  The other was that this was Johnny I was consolidating power because there was that old quote from Steve Jobs
[36:06.400 --> 36:13.080]  Where he said no one had more operational power at Apple besides himself than Johnny I've even though they had a chief operating officer
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.520]  Which is you know just it shows sort of his position in the company and then the sort of the third one was like the wall
[36:18.520 --> 36:24.320]  Street take where they're they're still upset that Apple doesn't disclose Johnny I because it was a senior vice president with direct reports and
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.040]  Certainly one of the top ten paid people at Apple and his salary is not disclosed
[36:28.040 --> 36:33.120]  But now as a chief design officer was very few direct reports. You could argue that it no longer needs to be
[36:33.840 --> 36:37.600]  Yeah, I don't think so. I don't know. I mean who knows about that
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.000]  I know that I think I only tweeted about it, but maybe I've blogged about it
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.440]  But it it it has our has struck me as weird over the years when they disclose executive payments
[36:46.440 --> 36:52.640]  Who's on the list and who's not like aren't had to be last year because her like the this?
[36:52.640 --> 36:57.640]  I guess you just call it loop it under a signing bonus, but she got an enormous amount up front
[36:57.640 --> 36:59.040]  I guess not her annual salary
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.560]  But she was just you know paid so much in her first year because like a signing bonus for taking the job that hers
[37:04.960 --> 37:06.960]  Her compensation had to be disclosed
[37:07.640 --> 37:12.240]  It sounds complicated. I read a fortune article. I forget who wrote it, but they were saying that it's the top ten
[37:13.360 --> 37:14.720]  Compensations on the team
[37:14.720 --> 37:21.200]  But if they don't have policy making positions then they're not included because they don't affect the what wall speed cares about with the company
[37:21.200 --> 37:24.040]  And it just seems to come ass. Yeah, it's it really does
[37:26.040 --> 37:29.920]  And you know my conclusion is really and you know I don't want to be
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.160]  I'm not trying to be cute, but I
[37:33.760 --> 37:37.840]  More or less if you just listen to Tim Cook's words in the internal memo
[37:37.840 --> 37:43.320]  We're announcing the deal describing what Johnny's responsible for that he was responsible for hardware design
[37:43.320 --> 37:54.000]  And now he's responsible for UI design and packaging and he's supervising the design of the headquarters and the retail in that New Yorker profiles
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.200]  Said he was doing the ads too. I mean it really is a Steve Jobs level of bread
[37:58.600 --> 38:03.480]  Yeah, I don't quite think ads like marketing like TV spots and
[38:04.440 --> 38:10.240]  Like magazine ads, but like those videos that he does right like the videos for the keynote. Yeah
[38:10.240 --> 38:15.040]  So even though he's not on stage in the keynote because he did
[38:15.040 --> 38:19.920]  I really do and I think it's as simple as that he is just is not keen as to be a public speaker
[38:19.920 --> 38:22.480]  Even though the few times he has done it, he's done fine
[38:22.480 --> 38:27.880]  I think it's like he just enjoys it so little and there's so much prep that's involved that he'd rather not
[38:27.960 --> 38:36.360]  It but instead his involvement in the presentations is literally supervising and if not editing, you know with his own hand the videos
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.560]  Yeah, and this seems to suit everyone's best interest because it it gets a word of the stuff that Johnny
[38:42.560 --> 38:45.640]  I've doesn't seem that happy to be doing which is the day-to-day managerial stuff
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.240]  But it also recognizes it almost like Apple's recognizing the job he was already doing and that sort of
[38:51.240 --> 38:56.440]  Assures his future in the company because you don't want him to either get bored or to feel like he's finished or to want something
[38:56.440 --> 38:58.840]  Different you want to keep him energized and engaged
[38:58.920 --> 39:04.560]  But at the same time it puts these two pillars underneath him sort of anything does happen or he decides to leave you
[39:04.560 --> 39:09.400]  You have a stable functional organization that can keep going underneath them and that's really more nable
[39:09.680 --> 39:14.840]  Yeah, I know it's exactly I do think that it makes a more sustainable organization now
[39:15.000 --> 39:20.080]  Would that mean that they would have to appoint a new chief design officer afterwards? I don't know
[39:20.760 --> 39:23.720]  I haven't you see oh yet right exactly
[39:25.440 --> 39:27.440]  Although I think that's coming
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.440]  We can maybe it's hold that thought and I'll do a sponsor break here
[39:32.440 --> 39:34.440]  And then we can we can talk about that
[39:34.880 --> 39:39.000]  But bottom lines. I don't think Johnny I was going anywhere. I think this is sort of a
[39:40.400 --> 39:43.080]  You know at this is sort of a couldn't
[39:45.040 --> 39:51.720]  Like making it official that Johnny I've and Tim Cook have a relationship like Tim Cook and Steve Jobs did
[39:51.760 --> 39:54.280]  like where there are two leaders to this company and
[39:55.360 --> 39:57.360]  It's a little different this time because
[39:58.440 --> 40:01.000]  The other way the guy with the you know
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.160]  The CEO right like it's it's a little different, but somebody has to be CEO
[40:07.240 --> 40:13.200]  But exactly I think in a way though that makes I've different from from jobs is I don't think Johnny
[40:13.200 --> 40:14.520]  I would ever want to be CEO
[40:14.520 --> 40:21.000]  I think part of this is that he's getting away from some of the stuff that a CEO would have to do some of this
[40:21.360 --> 40:23.360]  administrative stuff
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.600]  You know Johnny I've has no interest in negotiating with
[40:26.600 --> 40:32.800]  CBS television to get them on Apple TV right so it's you know
[40:32.840 --> 40:38.640]  It it just comes down to the personalities and the individual talent that they have but that he is as
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.840]  Important to cook as Cook was important to Steve Jobs
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.200]  Yeah, it's like you need those two sides of the coin doesn't really matter which side is on top at any given time
[40:46.200 --> 40:52.200]  But you need those two sides and the other thing that I thought was really good is the projects that Apple has coming up like campus to and like
[40:52.280 --> 40:56.200]  Project Titan those are things that Johnny I've seems really interested in which makes it seem further unlikely
[40:56.200 --> 41:03.180]  That it's anything other than a better positioning of all the talent they have in place. What's project Titan? That's the the automotive stuff. Oh
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.960]  Well, we can talk about that
[41:05.960 --> 41:07.960]  let me take a break though and
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.360]  thank our first sponsor and it is our good friends at
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.520]  Fracture you guys know fractured long-time sponsor of the show
[41:16.760 --> 41:21.640]  You guys keep buying their pictures so they keep coming back to sponsor it more so keep doing it
[41:21.640 --> 41:23.640]  But if you're haven't heard of it, you need to be reminded
[41:23.640 --> 41:29.480]  Fracture is a service. You go to their website and you send them your photos
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.600]  From any camera that you've whatever you've taken them with you pick a size could be small
[41:34.600 --> 41:40.360]  They've got real small ones fit on your desk could be big. They've got big 23 by 29 inch things you can mount on your wall
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.240]  You decide whether you want it rectangular or square. It's up to you
[41:45.240 --> 41:47.960]  They've got all the sizes all the aspect ratios you could want
[41:47.960 --> 41:54.720]  They take your photos and they print them directly on glass right on the glass right on the surface and
[41:55.160 --> 41:59.080]  They look amazing. They look like no other thing that I've ever seen
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.560]  They look so good that even no matter what the content of the photo is when you hang them up in your wall and you have friends over
[42:05.560 --> 42:09.400]  Family over people they see them out of the corner on and they say how did you do that?
[42:09.400 --> 42:14.520]  There's like a how did you do that aspect to it where at first they might think it's a regular photo
[42:14.520 --> 42:18.680]  But then they realize it's edge to edge and there is no frame around it and then they might think well
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.040]  Maybe it's like like a LCD type thing and then they realize that it's not it's not glowing
[42:24.040 --> 42:26.760]  It's a real picture like just an artifact
[42:27.800 --> 42:33.320]  It's it's stunning and so it's one of those things that it's like I can tell you this because I have a manger
[42:33.320 --> 42:35.400]  Around my house and I've had people say wow
[42:35.400 --> 42:40.280]  How did you get that and then I go into this same spiel that I tell you about on a podcast telling them in person?
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.280]  You should go there and
[42:42.280 --> 42:44.280]  Buy them yourself
[42:44.680 --> 42:48.360]  It really you have to see it to believe it and it's one of the hardest things
[42:48.360 --> 42:51.080]  I think for them to get across because when you go to their website
[42:51.080 --> 42:58.120]  You don't get that there's no way to show you on a website a picture of a thing to show you what it really looks like when you're looking at it
[42:58.120 --> 43:01.400]  A picture of a picture isn't the same thing is actually looking at the picture
[43:01.960 --> 43:08.600]  Really really impressive and you can get started at a really low price their prices are fantastic considering the quality of what you get
[43:08.600 --> 43:12.520]  Take your pictures father's days coming up
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.520]  I keep saying it's a great great gift for people in the in your family
[43:16.840 --> 43:20.360]  Right now as you listen to this you've got plenty of time to get stuff done for father's day
[43:20.360 --> 43:25.720]  So go make a note as soon as you're done listening to show go to fracture me calm
[43:26.280 --> 43:29.720]  F r a c t u r e me
[43:30.120 --> 43:33.480]  calm and remember this code daring fireball
[43:33.480 --> 43:40.200]  All one word daring fireball use that code and you will save 15% off your order
[43:40.760 --> 43:45.800]  So my thanks to fracture go there get your get your dad your grandfather your husband
[43:47.480 --> 43:51.160]  Uh some pictures for for father's day my thanks to them
[43:53.640 --> 43:55.640]  All right, so the car
[43:57.800 --> 43:59.800]  That's an interesting
[43:59.800 --> 44:04.840]  Thing thinking about in the context of Johnny. I've been promoted to chief design officer
[44:07.320 --> 44:10.600]  Because it's you think well, that's just all
[44:11.720 --> 44:13.720]  Industrial design, but there's you know
[44:14.840 --> 44:20.520]  I think that if apple is going to do a car it is absolutely going to be
[44:21.320 --> 44:23.320]  completely
[44:23.320 --> 44:26.440]  You know it the computerification of car design
[44:26.440 --> 44:32.680]  Like there's no way that it's not going to involve both you I design and industrial design
[44:33.560 --> 44:40.280]  No, I would not be surprised if you know the same kinds of engineers who worked on iPhones and other products are working on that now
[44:41.080 --> 44:47.000]  It's no guarantee that it's ever going to ship because I do think and you know that thousand knows for every yes mantra
[44:47.480 --> 44:49.880]  Some some of those nose come late
[44:49.880 --> 44:56.680]  We talked about this a couple weeks ago that you know that that TV just didn't ship for a year after year after year
[44:56.680 --> 45:00.280]  No, no one was interested in shipping it. They didn't think it was a great product. So it just sits in the lab
[45:00.920 --> 45:07.400]  Right, but there was there. Yeah, there were there were TVs and I think in hindsight poor gene monster
[45:08.760 --> 45:15.320]  But I do think that that's one of the reasons monster was so convinced and one of the things that analysts whilst reading analysts like him
[45:15.320 --> 45:20.120]  Do is develop sources in the supply chain
[45:21.080 --> 45:23.080]  and the ones who are most accurate like
[45:25.480 --> 45:28.200]  Ming key what's it Ming
[45:28.840 --> 45:30.680]  Ming chi quo
[45:30.920 --> 45:35.000]  You know and and some of the stunningly accurate things that he's had in recent years
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.040]  I think clearly come from the supply chain, you know that that he's talking to
[45:40.040 --> 45:47.000]  Like he for example nailed it on the screen sizes of the iPhone six and six plus
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.800]  And I think it was because he had sources at sharp and whoever else is making the displays for those things
[45:52.440 --> 45:54.440]  I
[45:54.680 --> 45:56.360]  Think monster
[45:56.360 --> 46:03.080]  Figured out through supply chain that Apple was making TV prototypes and then just extra you know it was and which is pretty
[46:03.080 --> 46:05.080]  You know that they weren't just
[46:05.080 --> 46:10.520]  Things that Apple had made in the Johnny I've lab which never comes, you know
[46:10.520 --> 46:11.720]  Nothing ever leaks out of there
[46:11.720 --> 46:16.520]  But they were in discussions with with manufacturers and wheels were starting to turn
[46:17.160 --> 46:19.640]  Over there just to get things set up
[46:19.960 --> 46:24.920]  And he just took that to mean well then that's a sure thing because I think with most companies once you get to that point
[46:25.640 --> 46:27.640]  It's gonna come out and they're gonna see how it does
[46:28.440 --> 46:34.680]  Yeah, and Apple's really different and Apple prototypes almost everything like if people like you or I can can think about it
[46:34.680 --> 46:36.680]  Or talk out loud about it on a website
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.520]  Apple has thought about it and investigated it whether it's like touchscreen max or arm max or television is all of that stuff
[46:42.760 --> 46:49.480]  When they when they don't ship something is because they've made an informed decision based on actual experience with prototype products that they don't want to ship it
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.480]  Right, and so you know there's no guarantee that a car is ever gonna ship but I definitely you know
[46:55.720 --> 46:56.120]  Oh god
[46:56.120 --> 46:59.560]  I'm this gonna be terrible pun, but I definitely think the wheels are turning
[46:59.560 --> 47:05.880]  Well, you look at it now like I was looking at at cars the other day and even within the same brand the interfaces are completely
[47:05.880 --> 47:11.240]  Different from one model to the other there is and that just to me says there's no vision for how this stuff should be done
[47:12.200 --> 47:16.600]  Oh, I definitely think so it's I've seen that I don't I've had my car since late
[47:16.840 --> 47:19.080]  2006, so it's been a while since I've shopped for a car
[47:19.080 --> 47:24.440]  But I remember the last time I did and driving like two cars from the same brand and being
[47:24.440 --> 47:29.640]  Just and that you know not that it was driving my decision as to what to buy
[47:29.640 --> 47:33.720]  But you know just absolutely rolling my eyes at the inconsistencies
[47:34.120 --> 47:41.320]  I bought my last car right before the advent of the infotainment system the connected stuff where you could just plug your iPhone or Android phone into it
[47:41.480 --> 47:44.360]  So I went to my dealer and I said can I just upgrade to the next year's
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.320]  Radio center and they said no, and I said what do I have to do?
[47:47.320 --> 47:51.640]  They said buy another car and that to me is probably one of those things that Apple just thinks is ludicrous
[47:51.640 --> 47:55.320]  It should be as easy to update what runs on your car as it is to what runs on your phone
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.280]  Right, I mean and not that you would be able to
[47:59.080 --> 48:00.920]  You know like
[48:00.920 --> 48:06.600]  You should be able to get like a software update. Yes, right that that's what you should be able to get for your car
[48:06.600 --> 48:11.720]  Not that you should be able to take the actual computer out and at a certain level Apple is a hey
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.800]  You have to buy you just have to buy a new phone. Yeah
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.520]  Company, but on another level
[48:16.760 --> 48:19.480]  You know there are significant features that you get
[48:19.480 --> 48:22.680]  You know two years after buying your phone by upgrading it
[48:23.800 --> 48:25.800]  Yeah, I think that the
[48:25.800 --> 48:30.760]  So far behind and and you're extremely car play car played Scott for us
[48:30.760 --> 48:34.760]  I was working on that years ago and it took forever to get to market and that shows
[48:34.760 --> 48:38.840]  I think the the slowness of that sort of a process and if Apple is going to do that
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.680]  The way Tesla for example had to build up their their car process
[48:42.920 --> 48:47.640]  We're talking a years and years of of experimentation never mind a release schedule
[48:47.640 --> 48:52.360]  Yeah, it's it's on a much longer time scale, but I've heard
[48:52.360 --> 48:54.760]  It's not it's not my original analogy
[48:54.760 --> 49:00.200]  I don't know who I'm stealing from but that car play is to Apple's car what the rocker was to the iPhone
[49:01.160 --> 49:04.120]  Even though the rocker was like one year before the iPhone
[49:04.920 --> 49:06.200]  the car play
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.400]  To me is really interesting because it's it's part of this huge transition that Apple's undergoing where before we had all this
[49:11.400 --> 49:15.000]  Pull interface where you have to go to some other place to well
[49:15.000 --> 49:19.400]  If we could just transition it apps for a second an app was this discrete bundle is a little binary
[49:19.400 --> 49:25.000]  You download it on your phone and you tap it and all the functionality would be inside that and the same way web kit is now
[49:25.160 --> 49:28.520]  HTTP apps everywhere doesn't really it's not all bundle and safari anymore
[49:28.920 --> 49:35.560]  With iOS 8 all the UI kit stuff is sort of an extensibility means that all an app functionality is now everywhere
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.200]  You can share the Pinterest from a share extension
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.440]  You can use one password from an action extension
[49:40.600 --> 49:43.160]  So the idea of those apps has sort of been torn apart
[49:43.160 --> 49:48.680]  And not only that not only can I just pull the notifications that are down and use pcalc there without going to the app
[49:49.160 --> 49:52.360]  I can now shoot that app to my Apple watch or shoot that app to my car
[49:52.360 --> 49:55.160]  It's like you know Marco's overcast is running on cars now
[49:55.160 --> 49:58.680]  And I think that fundamentally changes what it what it's going to mean to be software
[49:58.680 --> 50:04.360]  And I think car play with sort of one of the things Apple was doing to experiment with what that what that's going to be going forward
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Yeah
[50:07.640 --> 50:12.360]  It's now but that I'm just trying to decide what to go to next we could go to
[50:12.360 --> 50:15.240]  I'll give you a pick and then we'll do the other one we could to go to
[50:16.520 --> 50:22.680]  Google iO which is past tense sort of I guess it's technically like wrapping up its second day right now
[50:23.640 --> 50:27.800]  Or we could go to WWDC. I say we do the past first. We'll do Google. Yes
[50:29.400 --> 50:33.880]  And we'll do WWDC expectations afterwards. So Google iO
[50:34.760 --> 50:36.760]  keynote yesterday
[50:36.760 --> 50:43.160]  It seemed to run about seven hours. Oh, it's they were good this year. I mean, I think last hero just went on forever this year
[50:43.160 --> 50:45.160]  It was just long
[50:46.120 --> 50:49.800]  Announced a lot some of it quite you know pretty interesting to me
[50:51.320 --> 50:53.960]  I guess I guess maybe it was a little more focused than usual
[50:54.280 --> 50:59.160]  It was restrained. I mean, I remember some years where it would just almost seem like every five minutes of being entirely new
[50:59.160 --> 51:03.320]  Initiative or API or something being dropped and you'd never hear about them again
[51:03.320 --> 51:05.800]  And this year it seemed like they stuck to bigger more important things
[51:05.800 --> 51:10.840]  Yeah, and stuff that they've truly expect to ship. Yeah, I feel you know, and you know
[51:11.240 --> 51:16.200]  Not that Apple invented only talking about stuff that's really gonna ship, but I think it's a little more happily
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.280]  direction
[51:18.280 --> 51:20.520]  The whole thing was the whole thing had a much more
[51:21.080 --> 51:23.480]  And people get really upset when we talk about this stuff
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.600]  But it had a much more Apple sort of sensibility to it, especially with the new Android features
[51:29.160 --> 51:33.000]  And you could see this over time where originally to get market share of Google had to make everything
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.360]  Open and marketed as open as possible, but now from
[51:36.680 --> 51:38.680]  Google Play services to store reviews
[51:39.320 --> 51:41.320]  To a lot of the programs that they're doing
[51:41.320 --> 51:47.560]  They they need to exert a certain amount of control just to just to improve the experience and it looked like they're doing that again with this keynote
[51:49.320 --> 51:54.760]  Yeah, I mean, and there's a lot of little things, but one of those things that I noticed is
[51:56.280 --> 51:59.560]  When they talked about it's a program that I to me is very interesting
[51:59.560 --> 52:05.160]  But to me to my knowledge hasn't taken off yet, but I think has a good chance to is Android one
[52:05.960 --> 52:07.960]  which is their
[52:08.680 --> 52:11.240]  version of Android that is meant for
[52:12.920 --> 52:19.960]  quote unquote developing countries, but it's for people who don't have who cannot afford five or six hundred dollar phones
[52:20.680 --> 52:22.680]  And so what if they can only afford
[52:22.680 --> 52:30.200]  You know a hundred dollar phone or a hundred and twenty five dollar phone. How good can you make that today in 2015?
[52:30.920 --> 52:37.080]  And the thing that struck me about that is being Apple like not that Apple is going after that market has any product that
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.640]  They don't there is no iPhone that's targeted at that market
[52:39.640 --> 52:46.520]  But the way that it's I've Apple like to me is that it's not a here's a version of Android that runs on lower powered devices
[52:46.520 --> 52:52.280]  It's a whole thing like a device certification program in the only way you get it is if you go along with them
[52:52.280 --> 52:59.000]  And if you do your get it a Google has Apple style control over the OS where you get the latest of it
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  You know you're getting Android
[53:01.640 --> 53:10.520]  You know lollipop and then you'll get the Android M update when it comes out because the only way to participate in this as an OEM is to go along with
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.520]  Would Google is saying?
[53:13.480 --> 53:15.880]  There's there's a lot to unpack for me and one thing that that
[53:16.760 --> 53:19.080]  I maybe everyone knew this but me going into this but
[53:19.080 --> 53:25.600]  Apple's been starting their their keynote by reaffirming their corporate mantras and Tim Cook does that job
[53:25.600 --> 53:31.080]  He's like the moral compass of Apple and he talks about Apple's nor star being making great products and Google
[53:31.080 --> 53:33.440]  They used to be don't don't be evil but more and more often now
[53:33.440 --> 53:34.840]  They're saying you know Google is to work
[53:34.840 --> 53:40.040]  Google's purpose is to organize the world's data and make it easily accessible to everybody and once
[53:40.040 --> 53:45.600]  I said that I started watching the entire keynote through that lens and the thing like the the optimist in me is like
[53:45.600 --> 53:51.800]  Wow Google's using all this money that they make to bring technology whether it's internet in balloons or low-cost phones to everybody
[53:51.840 --> 53:55.640]  But then the cynic in me was saying that if they really want to collect all the world's data
[53:55.640 --> 54:00.800]  They need to have everybody in the world giving them their data and then when you look at everything
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.240]  They announced all these services, especially the ones that are really cool are sort of what you feeds
[54:05.240 --> 54:08.720]  What you the drugs you give somebody so they'll go and feed the beast for you
[54:08.720 --> 54:16.360]  And there's the profound difference between Apple wanting to make great products so that they can sell them at a high margin
[54:16.360 --> 54:21.440]  And make a good experience that you'll buy the next product where Google has to make these services that are so good
[54:21.440 --> 54:28.240]  That you'll be willing to give them your data on an ongoing basis and it's it's sort of a similar a similar strategy
[54:28.240 --> 54:31.360]  You can argue how successful each one is but they're both phenomenally successful
[54:31.920 --> 54:33.920]  But so different from each other
[54:33.920 --> 54:39.520]  Yeah, and it's you know the cynic in me always asks and you know with any company
[54:39.520 --> 54:41.680]  But you know how are they going to make money on this?
[54:41.920 --> 54:45.120]  How do they think they're going to make money on this and with a lot of their stuff?
[54:45.120 --> 54:52.840]  It's very dubious to me like with the whole internet balloons thing and it to me the honest way
[54:54.120 --> 54:59.800]  To make money on it would be to somehow take a share of what they're charging the people even if it's you know
[54:59.800 --> 55:05.280]  Compared to like us carriers even if people there are only paying a few dollars a month for self service
[55:05.760 --> 55:08.560]  You know by taking a share of that then they're making money
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.640]  The cynical way to do it would be if part of the terms of service for getting internet service through the Google balloons
[55:14.800 --> 55:21.040]  Is that Google gets to see an index all of the traffic going through the thing that reminded me of a part of this is
[55:21.040 --> 55:21.840]  I remember a few years ago
[55:21.840 --> 55:23.840]  There was a Google ad about a father
[55:23.840 --> 55:29.680]  Setting up a some kind of Google account might have been a Gmail account for his baby and starting to sort of document the baby's life
[55:29.680 --> 55:34.360]  And there was pushback on that saying how can you try to encourage people to put their children's data in there
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.480]  But now we live in a time where they just give Google accounts to schools and people say thank you
[55:38.920 --> 55:42.360]  And they say they're not going to they're not going to use that data
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.320]  I take them at their word
[55:43.320 --> 55:46.880]  But I used to work in advanced analytics and the actual data is not always that
[55:46.960 --> 55:49.880]  Importantly it you get vast quantities of data
[55:49.880 --> 55:54.600]  There's all sorts of patterns and behaviors and market vast analytics and and
[55:55.320 --> 55:58.000]  Just trends and things that you can find in that data
[55:58.000 --> 56:04.440]  That's immensely valuable and Google showed that with things like the machine learning and the neural networks on how their driverless
[56:04.960 --> 56:14.600]  Cars can now start picking out other cars and pedestrians because they're committing enough data and enough patterns and enough behaviors to understand that and that that's going to be immensely valuable to them
[56:14.600 --> 56:17.560]  So even if there's no direct return on a business unit
[56:17.560 --> 56:25.680]  Nature for things like the balloons all that stuff will feed their core business, which is collecting and making use of all that data
[56:27.360 --> 56:31.360]  Well, the question though is where do you you know the thing about
[56:32.120 --> 56:40.600]  Web search is that there is a place a very obvious place to show that which is right there at the top of the results and
[56:40.600 --> 56:51.240]  It's you know, I think they say web search, you know search advertising is 90% of Google's remains 90% of Google's revenue
[56:51.240 --> 56:56.160]  I think they really it all comes down to that top spot in the results and
[56:59.200 --> 57:04.120]  In some sense, okay, it's simply giving internet to people around the world through the balloons
[57:04.120 --> 57:10.280]  They don't need to make any money from the balloons because those people are going to search on Google and they're going to see those ads and a result I
[57:11.680 --> 57:19.160]  See that though as as such diminishing returns and just for the cynical reason that if you're in an impoverished country
[57:19.160 --> 57:25.040]  The ads those ad views just cannot be that valuable in that you're chasing instead of chasing pennies
[57:25.040 --> 57:28.200]  You're chasing fractions of a penny and you know
[57:28.200 --> 57:31.120]  It's not that it means that Google's going anywhere
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.560]  But it means that it's not I just don't see how that's a serious source of any kind of growth
[57:34.880 --> 57:38.400]  Yeah, I think that's a lot to do with why you see them branching out and again
[57:38.400 --> 57:42.400]  It's like when I my old job was doing the satellite stuff and it wasn't it wasn't really about search
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.720]  But there were other ways of of making huge amounts of money
[57:44.720 --> 57:50.800]  So for example if you go into a quicky mart and you buy Coke the quicky the Coke has no idea that you bought it
[57:50.800 --> 57:54.640]  But the quicky mart does and if you have a company that can go in and take that information
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.200]  You can sell that back to Coke and then you can sell it to Pepsi
[57:57.200 --> 58:01.920]  And if they bought Doritos with it, you can then sell that information to Doritos and they those companies use it
[58:01.920 --> 58:07.040]  When they decide where they're gonna put their products on shelves or what combinations or what sales or all this
[58:07.040 --> 58:12.720]  Have a immensely valuable to companies who want to get into these emerging markets and Apple and a lot of companies
[58:12.720 --> 58:14.720]  I've talked about the value of the brick countries
[58:14.720 --> 58:19.600]  But especially China is growing now Russia is growing now Brazil is growing now and they're gonna have huge economies
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.960]  And I think having actionable intelligence on those economies will be valuable and if Google is the one brokering all that
[58:24.960 --> 58:30.080]  And that makes Google as opposed to Facebook who's also doing these emerging market internet initiatives
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.080]  It gives them a better position
[58:32.080 --> 58:36.880]  My understanding is that a quicky mart in particular buzz Cola has an exclusive
[58:38.080 --> 58:41.120]  I think that's true. They don't even need to do any analytics
[58:42.080 --> 58:43.440]  I don't need to sound like I'm down. I'm going
[58:43.440 --> 58:48.320]  I just think that like you everybody some people think that you're not paying for this stuff and whether you're paying with money
[58:48.560 --> 58:51.600]  Or with time or with attention or with data
[58:51.600 --> 58:57.520]  You're always paying and you just have to be to understand the cost that it that your data is is valuable
[58:57.520 --> 59:00.480]  Like money is valuable and whether it's worth it for you to make that exchange
[59:00.720 --> 59:05.120]  Right, so speaking of paying for stuff that leads me directly to
[59:06.240 --> 59:10.720]  One of the top products that they announced that I owe this week that really caught my attention was Google photos
[59:11.520 --> 59:15.840]  So Google photos is pretty much Google's version of I've
[59:15.840 --> 59:21.920]  I cloud photo library and I don't mean that I wrote that and I don't mean it in the sense that I think they copied it
[59:21.920 --> 59:26.720]  I think it was inevitable for both companies to do this the basic idea was so obvious that of course
[59:26.720 --> 59:32.800]  They were both going to do it and it just so happened that you know Apple beat them to it
[59:33.840 --> 59:42.240]  It feels like the right solution. Yeah, which is basically you sign up and you have all of your devices where you deal with photos
[59:42.240 --> 59:46.240]  signed in and then all of your photos
[59:47.040 --> 59:55.360]  Go to through one cloud library and are therefore available on all your devices and to save space that you don't
[59:55.360 --> 1:00:00.560]  At once you have that and if the truth is in the cloud meaning your true library is the one that's in your cloud account
[1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:05.440]  Then your devices don't have to have all of your photos and if you have
[1:00:06.400 --> 1:00:10.720]  32 gigabytes of photos and videos in your personal library
[1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:15.520]  You only need a fraction of them on your device at any time and the rest can all be represented by
[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:19.360]  Truly tiny thumbnails and then drawn down from the cloud
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:22.400]  On demand when you want to open them
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:25.040]  You know
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:28.880]  Super smart. I used to call that you used to do that in storage a long time ago
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:32.800]  It was called in your line where you had all the frequently high-value data frequently accessed high-value data
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:37.120]  Right on the device because you needed to access it all the time and it had to be fast
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:43.120]  But everything else was stored just a step away and on much cheaper storage and in much bigger capacity
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:48.000]  And you would just get it when you needed it and it was very infrequent that you would actually need it
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.920]  And this is the same so all the photos you've taken recently all the ones that are your favorites
[1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:55.520]  All the ones that you access all the time are just right there in your device
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:58.880]  So you tap them in there there the ones that you maybe haven't looked at in three years
[1:00:58.880 --> 1:01:04.160]  You know, you probably won't look at very often if you have to tap that and it takes a second to download nobody really cares
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:11.600]  So they have two but the big difference to me the fundamental difference is that they're saying unlimited
[1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:18.080]  Storage for all of as many photos and videos as you want with the
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:22.320]  asterisk on unlimited being that they
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:28.720]  Recompress your photos in a hot you know in other words, and then they're not quite I don't maybe some others at technical time
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:36.400]  But in other words, they're using jpeg recompression to store good enough versions of your photos up to 16 megabytes
[1:01:38.080 --> 1:01:42.880]  You can pay for something which they call original which gives you the original the access to the original uncompressed
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:47.520]  But I think even then it's limited to 16 megabytes. I could be wrong
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:50.080]  I wasn't sure it sounded like if you were willing to pay for the storage
[1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:53.760]  You just got your photos, but they didn't say anything about raw either which I know apples crest
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:02.160]  Yes, which you know kind of me is one of those like you know difference between apple customers and Google customers
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:08.000]  And I'm sure yes, I'm absolutely sure that there are some pro photographers who shoot everything in raw
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:12.640]  Using some of the best cameras on earth who also are Android users no doubt about it
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:22.640]  But I think the truth is that most professional photographers are probably apple customers and probably have iPhones and care about things like that in a way that Android users don't
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:26.560]  Or is it something that they will announce in the course of the product rollout?
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:31.680]  Right, and of course all of this stuff can go on but the pricing difference is definitely different where you know
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:38.560]  It's it's pretty easy and in fact depending on how long you've been shooting digital photography photographs
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:43.600]  It might be likely for most people that they're all their complete collection of
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:49.680]  digital photographs not just from their phone, but you know everything they've taken for the last 10 years or so
[1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:53.760]  It's already bigger than the free storage tier that apple offers
[1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:58.880]  Whereas Google's is it's free for however many one with that caveat that they're going to recompress them
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:02.080]  But to what they you know claim to be still a very high level
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:05.120]  I know David Mark on on loop inside pointed this out
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:10.320]  But again like this this is fine if you want if you're happy paying with data because the terms of service are kind of nebulous
[1:03:10.320 --> 1:03:12.960]  So what they can do with it and I don't think they're gonna do anything wrong with it
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:16.640]  And a lot of it is always just covering your ass if you have to move servers or do something else
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:19.680]  And you don't want to be sued when you do the normal course of your business
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:23.680]  But you know with Apple you know no one's gonna show you an ad next to that photo your photos
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:29.280]  Never gonna be used as an ad at least Apple is currently being run and they're not gonna take when you do facial scans
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:30.800]  They're not gonna say oh, you know
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:32.160]  This is a photo of John Gruber now
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:37.040]  I know what John Gruber looks like and propagate that across their system where with Google you might not care about that
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:40.400]  But again, you should and I'm not saying that Apple couldn't reduce prices
[1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:46.320]  It's just Google is subsidizing it based on their business model where Apple's business model is not being used to subsidize photo
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:47.600]  It's cost of storage
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:52.640]  One of the reasons I don't use Gmail is I don't like the idea of ads next to my email
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:56.000]  And I really don't like the idea of context sensitive ads next to my email
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.560]  And maybe that's just because I'm a funny
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:05.200]  Fuddy-duddy who's been using email since the terminal days, but it's like a email to me is very personal and I
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:14.160]  Did just bothers me so Bradley Horowitz who's in Apple's or not Apple's Google's vice president for like
[1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:18.560]  What is it like photos streaming and something else pretty interesting title very specific?
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.280]  But it was you know more or less in charge of Google photos had an interesting interview with Steven Levy
[1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.960]  yesterday at at Steven's back channel and
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:33.600]  He his analogy which I found pretty compelling was that Google photos is
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:35.440]  Gmail for your photos
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:39.760]  But then the flip side of that is what you just said. Well wait your Gmail as ads
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:47.520]  Next to your photos. Are you going to if you have photos of your family at Disney world?
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:51.280]  Are you gonna get ads for universal Orlando next to those photos?
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:55.320]  I would find that it I would find that extremely bothersome
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:58.640]  With Apple's photos you can click to identify people's faces
[1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:02.400]  Google looks like they're doing that automatically and that's again to feed their machine learning system
[1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:04.400]  And I don't know if that bothers me or not
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:07.920]  There's a lot of things along this path that I got the Nexus 5
[1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.400]  Last year I tried to get the new Nexus phone every year
[1:05:10.400 --> 1:05:12.640]  And I turned it on and I said do you want to use Google now?
[1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:15.600]  And I said yeah, hell yeah, cuz it reminds me of Jarvis from the Ironman movies
[1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:18.720]  I want to use that and the first thing it said is can we access your full web
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:22.480]  History and I said no and I said well then you can't use Google now
[1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:23.920]  And that's technically not true
[1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:27.680]  There's a lot they could do for me without having to have access to my web history
[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.840]  And they might have changed that since then I haven't looked again
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:33.760]  But that that to me what the cost the price of that service was too high
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:38.800]  And again, I consider paying with data the same thing as paying with money
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:41.920]  So I don't get that service now and I understand why people would be reticent
[1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:47.280]  And by all means if you think it's a fantastic service it looks terrific if you're not bothered by this at all
[1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:52.240]  You know great, but I think it's worth at least considering the cost of what these services are
[1:05:52.800 --> 1:05:58.800]  So here's the storage pricing for iCloud and at this is at as of May 29 through knows
[1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:01.200]  We might get some new storage pricing in two weeks
[1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:03.840]  I don't know, but it and delightfully so
[1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:09.200]  The dollar amounts are identical in US and Canadian dollars. So
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:14.400]  No matter no matter which of me and Renee you're thinking of here's what we pay
[1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:18.480]  20 gigabytes you pay a dollar a month 200 gigabytes four bucks a month
[1:06:18.720 --> 1:06:22.640]  500 is 10 bucks a month and a terabyte of storage is 20 bucks a month
[1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:28.640]  So to me that's a you know, it's not bad
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:33.360]  20 gigabytes is very possibly too small for an awful lot of people
[1:06:34.160 --> 1:06:38.880]  200 gigabytes is probably enough for just about everybody and it's four dollars a month
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:41.760]  Which is not that bad, but it's you know
[1:06:42.240 --> 1:06:44.640]  Oh, you know, that's roundup. It's 50 bucks a year
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:49.680]  And so Apple is saying 50 bucks a year and Google is saying nothing
[1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:55.040]  That's a difference. I'm not saying that's going to draw people to it, but it's you know
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:57.040]  It's I pay for the
[1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:03.760]  I pay for the half terabyte plan right now, and it's absolutely a difference and also it's if you're on that free five gigabyte plan
[1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:07.200]  It's not just photos all your backups are in there as well and a lot of your other data
[1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:09.760]  Except that space as well and
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:14.400]  If you look at what pure Amazon S3 storage because Apple's using Amazon and Asia
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:16.400]  I believe to actually store this stuff
[1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.960]  You pay for you pay for the storage that you use so it's not an unheard of model
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:25.120]  But I think you know Apple's selling these devices. They make a lot of money off these devices
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.200]  It would probably be a compelling value at to customers if you said you bought you bought a 64 gigabyte device
[1:07:30.200 --> 1:07:33.200]  You're starting off at 64 gigabytes if you want more you can pay for it
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:38.720]  But at least you have enough to back up pretty much the content of that device. Yeah, I wonder
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:45.520]  You know presumably Apple is isn't paying like with a standard S3 plan
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:53.520]  No, I hope not when I be hilarious if any cue it just said set up like a just like signed into S3 and he just pays
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:56.160]  Like a regular bill every month
[1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:01.040]  There's a pile of paper bills in the water. I see next to him for every single I
[1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:04.320]  Bite of data
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:06.320]  presumably Apple has a
[1:08:07.360 --> 1:08:10.720]  Very special deal with Amazon for their use of S3
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:18.560]  So who knows what they're paying and how how close but it's it would be curious to know
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:24.120]  How close Apple as a company that is saying this is not our core competencies
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:26.920]  So we're gonna go out for storage and some of these you know
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:31.920]  Storage, you know some of these services to Amazon with S3 and Microsoft with Azure
[1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:38.820]  And even given our cloud and the size of the offer we can make and our you know
[1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:41.320]  Apple's famous
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:43.320]  Negotiating Acumen
[1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:49.480]  Even so that's so let's just presume that they've gotten very good favorable rates from both Amazon and Microsoft
[1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:53.640]  It would be interesting to know how that compares to
[1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:58.520]  Google's ability to do it completely internally in terms of cost
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:04.040]  And at one point is valuable enough for Apple where like maps is start to want to make that of their own core competency
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:10.200]  Right like how much does it, you know, is there a significant difference in the cost
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:16.440]  Partypical user who says okay. Yes, go ahead and store my entire photo library on your service
[1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:19.160]  What is that average out to for a typical user?
[1:09:20.360 --> 1:09:26.880]  For Apple using S3 and who knows what else you know and and Google doing it completely internally
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:28.000]  I think that would be interesting
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:28.680]  I'd be
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:31.840]  extraordinarily difficult to figure this out because I think you know
[1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:37.280]  It's obviously secret information for both companies and I think it would benefit Apple on the long run
[1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.920]  I like I cloud photo library. I think is a tremendous product
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:42.680]  I think it solves a problem in a really good way and cameras
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:47.440]  We know are incredibly important especially in iPhone upgrade cycles new cameras drive significant upgrades
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:52.040]  But if you always have friction if people feel either they don't use it or they feel as to expensive
[1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:55.240]  They're often going to hit that wall where they just they can't take a photo
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:58.680]  They want to take it they have to delete something else and that reduces the experience
[1:09:58.680 --> 1:10:03.840]  And it's just one more piece of friction that they could probably use their resources to overcome
[1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:11.400]  Yeah, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor and it's our good friends at Warby Parker
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:15.320]  Warby Parker is a new concept in eyewear. They were founded
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:22.440]  With a simple but lofty objective to create boutique quality classically crafted eyewear
[1:10:22.440 --> 1:10:29.640]  At revolutionary price points new pair of prescription glasses is typically pretty expensive hundreds of dollars
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:35.560]  Their ideas they could do it and and get them to start at 95 bucks
[1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:37.960]  So
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:44.040]  What do you do you go to their website? You go to warby parker.com and they have a whole bunch of eyewear glasses right there
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.240]  Look from and you can filter the view you can look at all the ones take if you're
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:55.200]  Just looking at women's prescription eyewear. You can just look at those if you're just looking at men's sunglasses
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:58.680]  You can just look at those you can filter it the way you want you can search for certain shapes
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:02.160]  Like if you know you really want to look for rectangular frames you can filter on that
[1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:08.680]  And but here's what you do anything here's I say this like with the mattresses and the pillows and all this stuff
[1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.840]  It's like well, how can you buy this stuff online?
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:14.080]  I mean glasses are so personal and you're face and you never know you think I hey
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:19.480]  I like these glasses those glasses look cool, and then you try them on in the store and you're looking like oh, this looks terrible on me
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:24.200]  Well, here's what you do you sign up and for free
[1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:29.400]  They you pick the five that you like the best and they just send them to you for free
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:33.180]  You know not with prescription lenses. They just send them to you with you know clear lenses
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:38.320]  You take them out you try them on you look in the mirror take a selfie you ask your
[1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:42.440]  You know your friends your significant other you ask them. Hey, how do I look with 20 like?
[1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:48.600]  And whichever ones you like if you just one you like if there's two you like whichever ones you like you send them all back
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.020]  Two or three days later, and then you go back to the website and say well
[1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:58.080]  Here's I know because I tried these on I want these frames and you give them your prescription from your you know your eye doctor and
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:04.040]  Like a couple of days later boom. You've got a brand new set of prescription glasses 95 bucks
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:07.240]  They don't upsell you on stuff like
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:15.480]  Anti reflective coating or using high index lenses high index lenses just is a fancy way of saying hey if your eyes are kind of bad
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.800]  The high index lenses lets the lenses still be relatively thin as opposed to you know like Coke bottle thick
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:26.240]  You want high index lenses if your eyes are bad because otherwise your glasses are going to be thick
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:29.480]  They just get you just get all that it's included
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:38.480]  Stuff you do have to pay more for would be progressives. That's if you know you need a reader reading lens if you're older and you need
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:42.280]  You know regular lenses like near-sighted lenses at the top and
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.160]  Bifocals at the bottom so they start at
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:51.880]  $295 which is a lot more than the regular ones, but it's way less than you pay for good progressives at
[1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:54.280]  Most eyewear shops
[1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:56.280]  I just bought a new pair
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:01.800]  It's they seriously I mean this is just coincidence that the podcast timing and such. I just bought a new pair a week ago
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:05.720]  Because with all this nonsense I'm going through with
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:08.280]  You know with my eye
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:14.640]  I need it a new prescription for my my old glasses the prescription in the left eye was it no longer relevant
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:19.720]  So I got a new pair I bought them from Orby Parker showed up way in advance of what they promised
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.880]  I think they said like hey you'll get them in 10 days and like four days later boom there they were
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:26.520]  And they look pretty cool and you know
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:32.600]  95 bucks and one of the reasons I was excited about it is that there's a good chance with the stuff
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:36.200]  I'm going through with my eye that we even within a few months. I might need a new prescription
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:43.400]  So I'm not even out that much money if these glasses only lasts me, you know three or four months before I need a different
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:47.880]  Description in my left eye. I'm only out 95 bucks, which is absolutely great
[1:13:48.840 --> 1:13:50.520]  Really really cool stuff now
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:55.640]  Here's one last thing I want to tell you about them is that they do a thing that I think is amazing
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:14:01.320]  So there's people all around the world who cannot afford prescription glasses. I cannot even imagine
[1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:05.560]  What that's like to need and to need prescription glasses and not be able to have them
[1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:10.920]  And so what they do is every time you place an order
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:19.320]  For prescription glasses they make available to people around the world who can't afford them a pair of prescription glasses
[1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:26.680]  So in addition to the fact that you're only paying 95 bucks for cool glasses that come quickly and have a wide variety of styles
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:31.560]  You're also doing something good for somebody else in the world who needs a pair of prescription glasses
[1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:39.240]  So it's really hard to beat that. So if you're in the market for glasses prescription or sunglasses or prescription sunglasses
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:44.840]  Go check them out. I really can't recommend them enough. Warby Parker dot com slash
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:48.680]  The talk show and they'll know you came from the show
[1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:51.400]  So my thanks to them
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.320]  What else from IO? Anything else? Yeah, the Google now
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:58.120]  Improvements and the I mean the Android stuff was interesting
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:00.360]  But a lot of them I thought was very similar some of them
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:04.360]  Lease was very similar to what Apple had been doing with iOS for a while like with permissions and with battery usage
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:10.120]  But the Google now and the on tap stuff which sadly doesn't mean beer is gonna pour from your lightning port thought that at first
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:16.680]  But the well, I guess they don't have lightning ports or USB port, but the stuff about that is what makes me so interested in
[1:15:16.680 --> 1:15:21.560]  Google is that is they're trying to make these better contextual engines where they can present you already like
[1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:26.520]  They know that if you have a flight coming because they read it off your email they can present you with the boarding pass for that flight
[1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:31.640]  But now they want to start doing it when you're in locations and in areas that they haven't explored so far
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:37.320]  And this is an area that Apple hasn't wanted to go into with Siri in Apple gets a lot of data from Siri and for a while
[1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:42.840]  They they just did not want to mingle or or act on your data on their servers
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:44.440]  It was there one of their privacy lines
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:47.320]  But now with the proactive stuff that Margaretman was
[1:15:48.120 --> 1:15:52.360]  Reporting on last week. It sounds like maybe that's changing at Apple and it makes me wonder what
[1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:56.760]  What a service like Google now or like on tap would be through apples?
[1:15:57.400 --> 1:16:01.240]  Strong privacy and security stance or filtering. Yeah, can we do that?
[1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:08.680]  Just take a time out here and say young young Mark Gurman over at 95 Mac has been on a run like no one else
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:12.360]  Hats off to young young Mark Gurman, but he seems to have
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:20.600]  Uncovered about 90 to 95 percent of what has publicly been revealed about WWDC and what's coming out
[1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:27.160]  I do think that's an interesting direction for Apple and I feel like
[1:16:27.160 --> 1:16:31.880]  Like with Apple and Google in particular that they
[1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:37.000]  Each you know depending on the nature of their companies get ahead of each other
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:42.120]  in certain ways and any other catches up and you know
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.280]  Sometimes we can say out well
[1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:48.280]  The one is copying the other but in the other hand it's not even about copying
[1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:52.280]  It's really just like it's inevitable that they're both going to go in that direction
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:57.000]  And they can go from little things like the copying paste pop up
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:00.680]  You know you just how to select text and how to copy and paste it
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.800]  Which you know iOS didn't have in the first few revs famously
[1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:09.960]  You like you couldn't copy and paste and then but then when they got it
[1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.480]  They nailed it and it's like oh, yeah
[1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:13.960]  this is the way to copy and paste on a touchscreen and
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:19.720]  Android experimented with a whole bunch of things and all of them quite frankly in my opinion
[1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:23.400]  Just really really stunk. It was one of the areas where Android was just
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:27.080]  It's just one of those things that drove me nuts about it every time I tried it
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:31.480]  And then coming up in Android M they've got what's effectively the iOS style of copy and paste
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:34.200]  Other things though, you know same thing
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:37.400]  Android had it first where you'd swipe down from the top of the screen
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:44.040]  And you see a list of your notifications and they had that for like two years before iOS had a notification center
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.200]  And guess what you swipe down from the top of your screen and there's a list of your notifications
[1:17:48.200 --> 1:17:50.200]  So it's not like it's a one-way street
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.720]  I think that this sort of contextually aware
[1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.600]  The phone knows some stuff about
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:17:59.800]  Where you are what you do
[1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.360]  You know where you are in a daily basis and can do smart things about it
[1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:11.080]  I think it's like it does every time I hear them say neural network or machine learning
[1:18:11.080 --> 1:18:13.080]  I do think of the terminator
[1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:17.560]  Because you know it's one of those things where you are where those movie sent to us as warnings
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:19.640]  And I'm saying that sounds paranoid
[1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:23.560]  But you never know how far the stuff is going to get and how much I want them to know about me
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:26.920]  Which goes back to the same privacy discussion about Google now previously
[1:18:27.160 --> 1:18:30.280]  So I would love to have Jarvis in my house
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:33.480]  But when I started thinking about it, it's just as scary as it is attractive
[1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:37.320]  So I'm conflicted about this technology
[1:18:37.320 --> 1:18:40.200]  But I think it does have absolute value and if you don't like it
[1:18:40.840 --> 1:18:44.760]  I would hope that a company like Apple and eventually Google would let you just use
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:49.160]  The functionality that Siri provides today where it has minimal knowledge of you and the knowledge that it does have
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:53.080]  It's on device knowledge and it's not doing any big data gathering or operations
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:58.520]  But for people who do want that who think that providing that data to get that service is a tremendous deal for them
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:02.920]  That I think Apple providing it makes all of iOS sort of more valuable to them
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:10.920]  I find some of the stuff in german's report on it to be a little confusing
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:18.680]  Because like his one of the things he says is that to begin with proactive will become a new layer within the iOS
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:23.880]  Operating system replacing the pull down spotlight menu currently found on the iOS home screen
[1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:27.800]  And you know again, I don't know where what his sources are. I don't know anything about this
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:31.400]  I've I'm you know completely in the dark never heard anything about it
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:34.920]  But that doesn't make any sense to me because that screen is not part of the OS
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:41.560]  Like the the two layers of the OS that go from top or bottom is control center from the bottom
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:46.760]  And notification center from the top and the reason those I call them layers of the OS is you can get them from anywhere
[1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:50.280]  Whereas to me what he's talking about is just part of the
[1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:55.320]  You know to use the internal lingo. It's part of springboard. It's only when you're on the home screen
[1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:58.360]  And it doesn't make any sense to me that
[1:19:58.360 --> 1:20:04.200]  It doesn't make any sense to me that this feature wouldn't be available everywhere to me
[1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:09.400]  It would only make sense in the hold down the home button layer where Siri takes over the whole screen
[1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:13.560]  But I don't know I think one of the things that I don't know if this is what he's describing or not
[1:20:14.440 --> 1:20:15.320]  But
[1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:21.080]  Previously Apple was doing a lot of really cool things and part of those were surfaced in Siri like Siri could do a lot of interesting search
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:24.840]  You could say like compare Apple or Google stock or get me these sports results
[1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:29.000]  And you could do a lot of interesting searches in spotlight, especially recently
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:35.960]  They made major changes to both Siri and spotlight recently and spotlight could get you a bunch of interesting information including Wikipedia and maps and ports of interest
[1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:39.000]  But and even app stores search
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:44.120]  They were all different like some did nearest neighbor and some didn't and some did some didn't care if you misspelled words
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.240]  And some didn't and so in spite of having all these great technologies
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:48.600]  They weren't merged together
[1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:50.600]  They didn't they weren't better than the sum of the parts
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:56.680]  And I think part of what this is is taking the engine that's being built into spotlight and the engine that's in Siri and sort of making something
[1:20:56.680 --> 1:20:58.680]  That is better than each of those individually
[1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:05.800]  And Siri is sort of an ancillary interface layer. It doesn't replace it doesn't replace that the multi-touch interface
[1:21:05.800 --> 1:21:08.720]  But it's there whenever you need it. Hmm. No, that makes sense
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:12.840]  What do you think about
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:15.920]  This this bothers me, but maybe I'm just not aware of the lingo
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.960]  But it bothers that this whole trend towards calling it machine learning bothers me because to me
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:25.880]  It's just AI we already have a term for it and my my my hunch is that
[1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:34.760]  Computer science world had talked about AI for so long and for so many decades and you know
[1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:39.560]  Famously, you know, we've Kubrick thought that by 2001 we'd have a computer
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:42.000]  You could just you know how that you could just talk to so
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:47.440]  defamously computer scientists as a whole were vastly over
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:55.760]  Optimistic in terms of when we would get to like talk to a computer and hold a conversation with them AI
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:03.520]  And that it burned out the term and so we come up with this new thing called machine learning that is
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:09.760]  It doesn't you know, it's two different words, but it would just you know a different branch of AI
[1:22:09.760 --> 1:22:14.920]  I remember in do this was one of my favorite movie books and movies growing up where they had that
[1:22:14.920 --> 1:22:17.280]  But Larry and jahad and they made a new commandment thing
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.080]  I'll show up make no machine that thinks like a man
[1:22:19.280 --> 1:22:23.200]  So it's been all part of our culture growing up and I by no means have any
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:26.800]  Civil knowledge of AI, but it does it does seem like there's this
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.480]  There's this recognition that's coming out that we're getting smart objects, but they're not smart the way AI is
[1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:37.800]  Touch ID makes a home button smart the way Siri makes the microphone smart the way
[1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:43.640]  Connect makes the the camera smart, but it's not smart and a terminator or matrix way
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:44.840]  It's just it's useful
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:51.520]  And I wonder if if this is sort of like what Jeff Hawkins was doing at Nementa where there was a realization that we can't make them
[1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:54.920]  Think like us so we've got to go sort of part of the way there and this is
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:23:00.400]  Using machine learning as distinct from AI because it's not artificially intelligent in the way we always imagined it
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:04.120]  It's just a machine learning to recognize context in other specific areas
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:09.880]  Hmm, yeah, one of the examples that Google gave and it does seem and this is one of those areas where it seems like Google is
[1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:17.680]  Not just ahead of Apple, but ahead of everybody, but definitely ahead of Apple is in the aforementioned Google photos project
[1:23:18.880 --> 1:23:23.040]  They're doing more so Apple's been doing face recognition for for years
[1:23:23.040 --> 1:23:26.360]  And you know, but they're doing a lot more
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:32.200]  They're doing like recognizing when a picture was of a snowfall and saying I mean who knows does this work?
[1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:36.760]  I don't know but that they're saying it, you know, you can say I remember that snowfall back in
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.880]  2010 and you could search for snow in 2010 and come up with the photos you took of the you know
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:47.200]  Snowpiled on your car or whatever which is really pretty cool and it
[1:23:47.880 --> 1:23:50.840]  But it also seems believable it seems like wow
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:53.720]  But that's really complex and really interesting how they got there
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:24:00.200]  But I kind of believe it if they can do face recognition. Why can't they do this is you know a snowy scene
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:03.920]  It's sort of like when they told us that Siri would get better when the more people use it
[1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:05.920]  It's all of these technologies require
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:12.080]  Ungodly amounts of data. It's part of why I think Google really wants to get us to give it more data because it
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:16.240]  Who knows how much it needs to consume of snow before it starts to understand and recognize
[1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:19.760]  Snow that movie X Machina that just came out
[1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:24.920]  They have a guy there who sort of it's sort of like the Google company in that universe and in order to make his AI
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:31.400]  He he hacked every phone in the world to read every facial feature in the world said he'd have enough data to reproduce them
[1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:36.040]  And that was the volume that he needed and it always seemed to me like when you start doing facial recognition or snow
[1:24:36.040 --> 1:24:43.640]  Or when you have driverless cars the amount of raw data you need to get to what the car needs or the photo needs to to make the machine
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:46.000]  Understand it is just immense hmm
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:49.320]  Yeah, I can totally see that
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:53.800]  Anything else on IO
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:59.480]  I think I think that was all the really I mean there was the cardboard stuff where they have VR in VR is fascinating to me
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:01.480]  It's like when Facebook bought
[1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:04.800]  Oculus because it's always been interesting to me that on a computer
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:07.320]  I can have Facebook or Google open in one little window
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:09.960]  But then switch quickly you're on a phone. It's in one little app
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:13.080]  But I can switch quickly but once it's VR and on your face
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:18.240]  I mean I don't know how to quit out of Oculus when it's strapped to my head or quit out of cardboard when it's strapped to my face
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:24.200]  So it seems like that's sort of the complete all-incompassing presence that they've always wanted
[1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:26.320]  Yeah, have you ever used cardboard?
[1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.040]  I haven't I've used Oculus a couple times and I've used Google Glass but I haven't used cardboard
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:36.160]  I am worried that I'm not going to be able to use it
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.360]  I'm worried that my eye situation that maybe the time where I can see 3D is over
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:46.480]  But we'll see but it does feel like it seems interesting and I had to say like I was watching the keynote
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:52.800]  I at least want to watch some of the Google IO keynote and I was watching on the TV and my son had gotten home from school
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.960]  And he was like man this stuff this these guys are boring and then when that part kicked in he was like wait
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.800]  This is pretty cool
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:03.840]  So I don't know I kind of you know when they first came out with the last year
[1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.320]  I thought it was kind of janky but
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:13.280]  Just because they only one they had was this seriously simple stupid cardboard thing but
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.120]  I don't know it seems pretty interesting to be able to do it
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:21.120]  I don't know but you raise a good point because this is one of the first interfaces
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:23.040]  Where I mean there's always going to be accessibility issues
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:28.240]  But this is one of these first interfaces where there's a tremendous amount of the population who can't watch 3D movies because they're
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:31.520]  Just not comfortable with their eyes converging and focusing on different planes
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:35.440]  And they get vertigo where they get seasick and they're trying to fix these
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.000]  But there will always be a large amount of people who will not be able to use this as an interface
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:46.560]  And to me investing in it that heavily is interesting despite that even before I had this retina issue and had vision problems
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.400]  Even before that even when I saw 2020 out of both eyes at distance
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:53.680]  I've never enjoyed a 3D movie
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:59.600]  Other than like a short one at like Disney like where you go in and you're in and out in five minutes
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:01.600]  And it's like wow that was pretty cool
[1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:05.760]  And I'll tell you what it is for me is I go and see a 3D movie
[1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.920]  And I could I can see the 3D and it's like I don't have any problems with the
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:14.480]  What do you call it like words some people have trouble seeing the 3D
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:21.280]  But I would come out of the movie and and I will realize I don't remember the second half of it
[1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:26.400]  Like I'll be like I honest to god don't remember what the hell happened there like I remember and I saw
[1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:30.800]  Perfect example is up
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:37.680]  I saw Pixar's up in 3D for the first time and I came out thinking hey, that was pretty good. And then I realized I really
[1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:42.560]  The whole thing once once the kid was in the house. I really didn't remember
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:44.320]  I was like there was some kind of old you know
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:46.480]  I remember vaguely there was the old guy who had the dogs
[1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:53.200]  But it was like I really could not summarize the plot like I I have to spend so much time concentrating on the 3D that I
[1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:56.320]  I cannot just sit back and watch the movie and then when I watched up
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:28:02.160]  The second time in 2D I was so much more impressed with the movie. I was like wow
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:06.640]  This is so clever. This is a typical Pixar movie where every single scene is good
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:10.960]  Every line is worth, you know every line of dialogue is worth it
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:15.280]  It's like and I just didn't have that impression watching in 3D. I had the same problem with a
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:19.200]  I got accidentally about 3D tickets to Avengers Age of Ultron and the
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:23.200]  Fight scenes were just undigestable to me. There was so much visual information
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.880]  I had very little idea what was happening and I went back and saw it in 2D and I was fine
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:32.880]  Yeah, I haven't seen it yet. My son has and tells me that it's I that I'm an idiot for not having seen it already
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:34.880]  That's Ultron. It's AI
[1:28:37.920 --> 1:28:42.160]  Let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor and these guys
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:48.960]  I've been longtime friends of the show haven't been with this for a while happy to have them back and it's mail route
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:55.600]  How do I know how would you pronounce it Renee R-O-U-T-E mail route? I do the same thing mail route
[1:28:55.600 --> 1:29:01.440]  But some people might call it mail route. Well either way M-A-I-L-R-O-U-T-E
[1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:08.560]  You know who you want protecting your email email nerds who do nothing but
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:14.000]  Email that's what mail route is these guys created the first cloud-based email filtering solution
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:18.320]  And they sold it to Microsoft another back with their own company
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:20.480]  and
[1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:24.320]  It is a really innovative and effective spam and virus
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:31.200]  Filtering filtering for your email mail route. So imagine a world without spam viruses bounce email
[1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:35.840]  Imagine a joy of opening your email and seeing only legit email that you need
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:41.440]  And imagine that with a mail server that you control your own mail server on your domain
[1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:46.800]  For your organization something like that mail route wants you to feel this joy
[1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.240]  There's no hardware or software to install or maintain
[1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:55.200]  You don't go in your server and hook up mail route mail route simply receives your mail
[1:29:55.440 --> 1:29:58.960]  sorts it and then delivers only clean email to your mailbox
[1:29:59.040 --> 1:30:04.320]  So what you do is you go in it's sort of like a DNS type thing you go in and change a DNS records
[1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:10.400]  Your mx records for mail so that your mail for your server that you control goes through mail route first
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:14.960]  They don't host your email. They're not an email hosting thing. All they do is they
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.480]  That it mail from the outside world comes through them first
[1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:22.240]  They filter it and then it goes on from mail route to your
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:27.040]  Server, so you're not giving up control of your server if you're an email admin or an IT pro
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:32.960]  They're not asking you to let them host your email server. They're just saying filter your mail through them first
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:38.240]  This is all they do these guys. They're like like the world's you know like
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:45.280]  Preeminent like email experts. All they do is email and it really works at charm
[1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:49.200]  It just removes all the cruff from your life and then your server
[1:30:50.240 --> 1:30:52.240]  Only has to deal with the good email
[1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:55.200]  They have tons of features
[1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:57.920]  API's anything you want you know their nerds
[1:30:58.080 --> 1:31:01.760]  You can set it up very simply and just have just say just hey
[1:31:01.760 --> 1:31:05.520]  Just filter my spam and the crap and give me the rest you want to customize it
[1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:11.360]  They've got everything you'd want to do to customize it if you are in charge of IT at your at your company and stuff like that
[1:31:11.840 --> 1:31:15.680]  Really really really encourage you to check them out. It is a great service
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:21.520]  I know a whole bunch of people who have signed up for this and I haven't heard a single bad word about mail route
[1:31:22.080 --> 1:31:24.800]  So here's what you do go to mail route
[1:31:25.760 --> 1:31:28.720]  dot net mail route dot net
[1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:35.200]  slash the talk show and you'll get a a you get a free trial so you can try it out
[1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:40.720]  And if you don't like it then you just change your your mx records back to pointing it directly at your mail
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.720]  Server easy to change back
[1:31:42.720 --> 1:31:45.360]  You don't have to like copy all your email. You're not copying your email there
[1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:48.240]  You just change the mx record and all of a sudden you're back to where you were
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:51.920]  So you can undo the free trial at any time if you don't like it
[1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:57.440]  But set it up set up the free trial start filtering your mail through them and use that slash the talk show
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:02.400]  And you'll get 10% off not for the first month, but forever for the lifetime of your account
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:04.400]  You'll save 10%
[1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:07.680]  Just for being smart enough to try mail route and smart enough to
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:12.080]  Listen to the talk show so my thanks to them check out mail route
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:18.400]  Anything else that I owe
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:21.760]  I think that was the main stuff. Yeah, so WWDC
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:24.480]  What do you think is coming up?
[1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:32.080]  I think Apple's gonna stick with iOS 9 and OS 10 point 11. I think we'll see the new Apple TV
[1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:35.120]  We'll get some more word on home kit
[1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:42.240]  Apple TV might come with a game store or an app store. I think those will probably be the least that the big stuff. Yeah, I
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:44.960]  am surprised to hear this, but
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:53.600]  So at the code conference this week Jeff Williams was you know, and this is a conference that Steve
[1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:55.600]  This is the Walt Mossberg Kara Swisher
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:33:02.880]  Hosted conference that for years was like the all things D conference while they were at the Wall Street Journal and now it's the code conference
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:07.200]  Now that they're on their own at recode slash Comcast
[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:14.000]  Zing
[1:33:15.200 --> 1:33:19.440]  And for years, I don't know if there's maybe there's a year where nobody from Apple showed up
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:25.600]  I don't know but for years somebody from Apple has shown up jobs was there many times and some of his most famous
[1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:29.840]  Sort of off the cuff interviews in the last you know 10 15 years came to that conference
[1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:36.160]  Obviously he's pretty hard yet. He was a pretty hard get Tim Cook has spoken there a few years ago
[1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:38.160]  That's the conference where Tim Cook
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:42.080]  Said that the wrist is interesting. This was that was two years ago
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:48.240]  And this year speaking from Apple was Jeff Williams
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:53.440]  So I thought that was you know as an apple nerd that was something to cut my eye because to me like
[1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:58.800]  Being an apple exec who is authorized with an apple to go there and speak
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:02.800]  You know not necessarily open by the standards of open but you know
[1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:06.960]  Instead wasn't just a bunch of no comments and in fact he said some interesting things
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:12.880]  But it's also sort of another sign of Jeff Williams is leveling up within the
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:20.640]  Executive hierarchy. Yeah, we saw him do the research kit presentation. Yeah, the last event and I thought he did an excellent job for his first time
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:26.000]  Yeah, and you know and in addition to the fact that
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:32.160]  He did a great job on stage. It was to me an important and interesting thing that he announced
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:39.520]  And something that was dropped like a you know a true surprise something that had not been leaked in any way
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:44.240]  I think the stuff that like if you look at the stuff that's in Federigies or that traditionally doesn't leak
[1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:50.600]  We don't start hearing about stuff until it starts leaving that core group of engineers. Yeah, I agree
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:35:00.400]  So, you know first sign of Jeff Williams's leveling up was a significant on stage presence at one of their public events and then another sign here is
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:08.960]  His appearance at the code conference and so my conjecture is that I don't know if it's imminent
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:15.440]  But I would think sooner rather than later Jeff Williams is going to get a promotion to chief operating officer
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:19.040]  As he was sort of it would Tim Cook was chief operating officer Jeff Williams was
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:22.640]  Right underneath him and then he became senior vice president of operations
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:26.400]  Which is not exactly the same thing as chief operating officers not a sea level position
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:31.280]  So that makes that makes a lot of sense especially if if operations continues on one hand
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:33.600]  I can see it because Tim Cook is an operations guy
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:38.480]  So you might think you don't need a COO and the CEO is in fact that good at operations
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:43.600]  But I think it just makes sense as as Jeff Williams continues to do these impressive projects that that title guess
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:47.560]  Weath to him. Yeah, I think so and well and quite frankly
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:54.280]  I honestly think I think it's a lot harder to guess than it was with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook
[1:35:54.280 --> 1:36:02.200]  But my guess is that the current succession plan if something happened to Tim Cook would be for Jeff Williams to be named CEO
[1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:06.440]  Yeah, I thought the same thing and that it's it's and again
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:11.320]  It's funny how things change where when when Steve Jobs, you know, was
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:14.760]  Sick and it would I mean a
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:19.960]  Responsible company would have a succession plan even with a perfectly healthy CEO like Tim Cook to I
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:25.400]  Well, it's a responsibility of the board if they don't then the board can I think can be you know
[1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:28.680]  Is is liable to shareholder suits, et cetera
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:33.560]  Tim Cook seems to me like the type of guy who you know
[1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:36.440]  Always has insurance
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.440]  Right, right like you don't have to remind him that you have to you know
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:46.360]  You should you know make sure you get renters insurance on that you know rental property. It's like he he's already got it
[1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:52.280]  It's a line item. Um, but my guess is that the current succession plan if it needed to come in would be for Jeff Williams
[1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:56.280]  And the funny difference would be that when Steve Jobs they needed a succession plan
[1:36:56.920 --> 1:37:01.880]  Their idea is the last thing we're going to try to do is replace Steve Jobs with another Steve Jobs
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:06.840]  Because there is no other Steve Jobs and whereas my guess with Tim Cook is
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:12.680]  We would replace him with the closest thing we have to another Tim Cook which is Jeff Williams
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:15.480]  A guy with the exact same background
[1:37:16.520 --> 1:37:21.000]  Uh, you know, they just seem like you know two peas in a pod really
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.960]  I mean they and not that you know, and I'm sure if you got to know them personally
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:25.080]  I'm sure they're their individuals
[1:37:25.080 --> 1:37:31.160]  But at least from the outside they are extremely similar individuals operations background even they're both
[1:37:31.800 --> 1:37:33.800]  from the US South
[1:37:33.800 --> 1:37:40.520]  They seem to have similar demeanors even you know and and similar reputations within the company for
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:42.520]  Or getting shit done
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:44.920]  And absolutely and Steve Jobs was unique
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:50.200]  But he did have some of the skills that are really important for a CEO including the ability to make those deals and the ability to
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:52.520]  To rally shareholders
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:54.520]  But a lot of the other things
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:56.920]  It's not typical like you said earlier Johnny. I've
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:01.240]  Probably has no aspirations be CEO because that's not the kind of job you'd enjoy doing
[1:38:01.240 --> 1:38:03.080]  And I think that's true of a lot of them
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:05.640]  Whether it's marketing or services or something else
[1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:08.200]  Like Craig for a greedy a fit Ricky a CEO makes no sense
[1:38:08.200 --> 1:38:08.680]  Right
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.600]  Even though he's phenomenal. I definitely just seems like the best fit for that job
[1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:16.360]  Right like what it really means to be a pure CEO
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:20.840]  It really to me comes out of operations and combined with
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:27.960]  A deep understanding of what it is that makes Apple Apple right and you know that I don't think you know
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:29.640]  I again
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:31.640]  I really do not think that
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:37.800]  In the near future that they would ever consider looking outside the company for replacement, you know
[1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.360]  CEO it would it would have to take a
[1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.640]  Significant and I think years long
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:50.120]  Drought of you know of you know declines and revenue and problems with products
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:55.160]  You know for them to even think about that it would have to be a situation where something was clearly going wrong
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:59.720]  Whereas as long as things are going right or in my opinion even just like okay
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:03.080]  They're only gonna look inside
[1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:08.920]  I agree completely. I don't think there's it's such a unique culture and getting someone at that level acclimatize to that culture
[1:39:08.920 --> 1:39:12.280]  I mean we've heard about having some of the problems with the vast amount of engineers
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:15.000]  But getting an executive in there at that level
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:18.520]  I can understand bringing Angela Aaron's but we saw what happened when he brought in
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:21.720]  John Browitt before that. It's just not an easy thing to do
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:24.920]  You know years from now who knows you know?
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:28.600]  I and you Lawrence could be on that list too, but it's you know
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:32.040]  But it wouldn't be like a near term if something happened near term
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.360]  And I don't think that's gonna happen. I think Tim Cook is you know
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:36.840]  I this he's made Apple this life
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:38.840]  I think it would be like an emergency situation
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:42.520]  But they have to have a plan for it. So another way to look at it to me is
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:48.280]  You know there are places you hear about places where they only like to hire software engineers from Stanford
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:51.320]  MIT and yes, you know Caltech and Carnegie Mellon
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:55.000]  Like if you're not in the top five comp side programs, they don't want it
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:56.920]  They don't want to look at you
[1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:03.000]  I think Apple for like a chief executive is only looking at graduates of Apple University
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:11.960]  Yeah, not if you if you haven't gone through app years-long program through Apple University and learn the Apple way from the last
[1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:13.800]  15 to 20 years
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:18.520]  They're not looking at you any only the only way to go through Apple University is to
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:21.080]  Be a long-time executive at Apple
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:27.800]  Yeah, absolutely. I think Angela is again running Apple retail and stores is one of the closest jobs to being president of the vision of Apple
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:29.320]  Maybe only iTunes is similar
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:31.160]  Yeah, the scope of that operation
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:35.560]  So those those are two people who could and Angela Aaron's did run her own business for a long time
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:38.840]  But like you said that the length of time in the company is what makes it Apple?
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:42.360]  Yeah, yeah, it is sort of their her own division and and in a sense
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:44.760]  You know for example she gets her own marketing
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:46.440]  You know again
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:49.320]  I'm maybe the posters gum through Shiller's group or whatever
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:56.360]  But just the general sense that when you walk into the Apple store the experience of walking in I mean and literally
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:59.000]  I mean this totally literally like how it smells
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:06.520]  Every sense that is engaged when you're in that store is a reflection of Apple's brand and you know being and that's an enormous
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:12.440]  Brand responsibility and again that makes it that makes her more like the president of a of a end of it
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:14.440]  You know a separate division
[1:41:14.440 --> 1:41:19.560]  Yeah, absolutely. I think he was similar because again they have marketing and they have events and they have developers
[1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:22.120]  And they have designers and all those people working in iTunes
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.200]  No, could easily be its own company as well
[1:41:24.200 --> 1:41:28.600]  But he just seems ideally suited for what he does which is making those sort of entertainment deals
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:31.720]  Yeah, cue would be on my short list of guesses though, too
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:32.760]  Definitely
[1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:37.160]  Which is interesting because I've been thinking about this a lot because they were all the rumors of the new Apple TV coming out
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:41.640]  And the Apple TV unlike the iPhone and the iPad is under the iTunes organization
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:44.920]  And it's been so long since it was updated. It was last updated
[1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:51.240]  2012 the spring what what that means for a product when Apple looks at it as not just being a device
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:56.680]  But being a device that has to be bundled with services in this case, you know media properties or content deals
[1:41:57.240 --> 1:42:00.680]  Because otherwise they could have just been updating this every year the way they've been updating iPhones
[1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:02.600]  Yeah, so that's that's the thing
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:13.160]  I'm most excited about for WWDC this year at least unless they have you know other than the I vague idea that they have a complete surprise to pull the you know to pull the the curtain on
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.000]  But you know so we blah, blah, blah new Apple TV
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:25.640]  And maybe they have an SDK etc etc. We don't know anything about it like they've kept that that's been like the details of it
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:28.200]  Have been to at least from everything I've seen
[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:32.600]  It's pretty pretty under wraps and but I really do think it's coming this year
[1:42:33.080 --> 1:42:37.960]  I would put money on it. I think we can guess a little bit like it's running a single core a5 processor right now
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:43.360]  And they've almost certainly got to do they're gonna go it's an iOS device it runs a version of iOS 8 right now
[1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:49.640]  That has just a different version enough you mean right now meaning if you go into a store and buy a nine or 69 dollar Apple TV right now
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:54.280]  Right yeah single core a5 processor running iOS 8.3. I think it's been updated 8.3
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:57.240]  But you know if they put an a7 a8 class
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:43:00.600]  Processor in there if they let it run something like metal
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:06.280]  Like if they start incorporating technologies into it like Siri then I think if you just look at it as an iOS device
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:11.560]  And you bring it up to parity with last years or this year's iPhone or iPad then that becomes a very
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:17.000]  Maybe a more expensive device we've seen before but becomes a really interesting device and you know it just in terms
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:22.600]  It's crazy and they do these comparisons as they've gone to retina screens where they show like what a 1080p
[1:43:22.600 --> 1:43:24.600]  TV
[1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:35.080]  TV pixel for pixel looks like on a retina 5k iMac or something like that and you see oh my god the 1080p TV is like just a tiny little rectangle in the corner
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:43.240]  I mean you could do like side by side 1080p on a retina 5k my Mac right I'm pretty sure yeah
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:53.720]  Do four of them still have room for your pallets. So the ridiculous thing is that a new Apple TV to run a 1080p
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:44:01.640]  TV is pushing way fewer pixels than an iPhone 6 or 6 plus I guess it's just not even breaking a sweat
[1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:06.600]  In terms of that in terms of what they could get away with you know at a cost efficient level
[1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:12.120]  So I'm really excited to see that to see what they do to see what the input methods are
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:14.120]  And to see
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:18.200]  What kind of SDK they're giving they're giving to us?
[1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:25.160]  That's a super interesting thing and I think you know the the platform technologies group under Johnny Saruji the other Johnny at Apple
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:29.800]  I think never gets a credit they deserve but if you look at something like the Apple the iPad Air 2
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:34.800]  That machine is ludicrously overpowered for what you can do on it. That's got an 8x processor
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:41.320]  And a lot of companies that make money off-selling chips. It's not in their best interest to move too fast because they want to get as
[1:44:41.320 --> 1:44:44.360]  Much money as they can for every generation of chip Apple could care less
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:48.520]  So they just let these guys run as fast as they can. They don't say all the A7 is good enough
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:52.600]  We'll use that for two or three years. Yeah, they're not no you can fit an extra cord do it
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:58.560]  You can fit an extra more GPUs do it and they are I think for a while iOS to software was
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:04.320]  Perhaps ahead of the hardware, but I think we've entered an age now where I don't even know what you do with the power in an iPad
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:06.320]  To I don't think anything
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:07.800]  Maybe a high-end game taxes a little bit
[1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:12.440]  But I don't think anything on iOS taxes it and if you start putting that sort of power in an Apple TV
[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:16.680]  I don't outside of an SDK. I don't you don't need that to run HBO now
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:21.200]  So I think it's what they start doing both with the iPad going forward and with Apple TVs
[1:45:21.200 --> 1:45:25.760]  So start answering the questions of now that you have all this silicon. What do you run on it? Yeah?
[1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:31.400]  Can I tell you what my dream feature for Apple TV would be and I'm gonna rip it right off from my pal John sir
[1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:38.360]  Cusa, I don't know if you do listen to the the accidental tech podcast. Absolutely. It's got John sir Casey
[1:45:39.720 --> 1:45:41.720]  Oh
[1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:45.960]  Oh, yeah, all right. I got you the other guy the moderator. Yeah, the other guy
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:48.720]  So Syracuse I had a rant a few episodes ago
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:50.440]  And I know it's a recurring thing for him
[1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:54.440]  But his thing is you're watching a stream or a video or whatever and
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:57.520]  You go to fast forward
[1:45:57.520 --> 1:46:02.440]  Or he paused for too long and then when you come back it's back at the beginning
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:08.360]  Yeah, right like you're watching the Netflix stream and you just want to like I understand it with its streaming rather than
[1:46:08.360 --> 1:46:12.960]  Completely download I'm which I just go listen to the episode of ATP or Syracuse or Anna
[1:46:12.960 --> 1:46:17.440]  But I just I'm completely in agreement with him if I want to fast forward a
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:24.680]  Stream just show me you know thumbnails as it goes by but make sure that the time owned
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:29.760]  Even just if you just move the timeline and the scrubber and the timeline and don't even show me anything visually
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:34.880]  Just let me see the timeline and pick and if I say I know I just want to go back two minutes
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:41.480]  And I just go back just show the timeline animating for two minutes and then when I stop two minutes later and hit play
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:45.160]  If you need a second or two to catch up on the stream fine
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:51.400]  But make sure that that's where you start and the fact that so many streaming things on everything
[1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:57.920]  I've ever tried don't work that way drives me nuts and it's even worse because like
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:02.960]  Syracuse a we've been a Tivo house since forever. I think I got a Tivo
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:05.720]  in year 2000 when I
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:12.000]  My wife and I when I was working at parable in software. We went over rich seagull's house and he had a Tivo and
[1:47:13.360 --> 1:47:16.280]  It we immediately went out in the next day and bought a Tivo
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:17.360]  We were like this is a crazy ever
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:22.480]  But the thing with Tivo is when you fast forward it always just fast forwards and when you rewind it always
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:26.720]  Rewind and it always just starts where you want to start and you never have this problem
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:30.080]  And I know that's because Tivo is downloaded everything to a hard drive in the box
[1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:34.400]  But the simple fact is that with Tivo you can fast forward rewind
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:42.600]  Skimbs, you know scan whatever you want to call it backwards forwards jump forwards 15 minutes at any time and it just works and
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:49.400]  I swear to God if I have Apple TV could just do that for stuff. It that enough would sell me on it
[1:47:49.920 --> 1:47:52.760]  It's sort of like the original iPhone when you scroll Safari
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:54.760]  They didn't try to render the interface and slow you down
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:58.120]  Yeah, let you get where you were going and then filled it in behind you. Yes. That's what I want
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:01.560]  That's exactly what I want with you know like stream scanning
[1:48:02.520 --> 1:48:04.040]  And not to be a dick about it
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:09.040]  But also like I know that whatever content deals been delaying or at least influencing the Apple TV releases
[1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:14.000]  I'm not going to get that in Canada anyway, so just should be the hardware. I never thought about that. It's sad
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:16.640]  God that sucks
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.720]  Well, you still get the I still think I think Apple could do a better job even with their own content
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:29.640]  The iTunes content that you do get in Canada and I really like to see them focus on that experience and put the sort of
[1:48:29.840 --> 1:48:35.400]  Yeah, it's the comparing it to scrolling on the iPhone is exactly right like obviously right from the get-go
[1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:42.760]  When when the software was way more ambitious than the hardware could support they still focused on making sure the experience was
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:44.360]  responsive and
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:46.760]  That even if you had to wait to catch up at least you
[1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:51.000]  It wasn't like if you scroll too far down on the web page all of a sudden
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:56.480]  It snapped you to the top which would be make you mad, but which happens with streaming stuff all the time
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:02.600]  You know, there's super smart engineers working on Apple TV and maybe there were some frustrations
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:07.760]  Maybe there were some false stars, but it's they've had a long time now and it feels like there's a big technology gap
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:10.840]  That's gonna help with performance and I'll end things are smarter now
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:14.480]  So hopefully a lot of that will get rectified. Yeah, my my you know
[1:49:14.480 --> 1:49:18.360]  And again not to put too much on them because who knows maybe it'll be an underwhelming announcement
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:19.820]  And I'm not gonna hold it against them
[1:49:19.820 --> 1:49:26.520]  But I will just say knowing that there are some really smart people who've been working on it for a while and that some of the hold up
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:32.360]  If not all of it a lot of it has been content negotiation and figuring out what we're gonna do in terms of service wise
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:38.240]  And it was external that it's possible that the internal team is really kind of might be on the you know
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:45.320]  Be able to to do like it's like a 2.0 version of whatever it is that they were going to if they might have shipped two years ago
[1:49:45.320 --> 1:49:49.840]  That they would have shipped them, you know that they're already at like a next-generation version of it
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:53.080]  And there's so much in Iowa say that they're not for example last year
[1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:57.240]  We almost had no iTunes announcements. I can I can I don't think I can remember very many at all
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:01.100]  And the ones we did get like iTunes radio they never propagated because the beats merger
[1:50:01.100 --> 1:50:06.240]  Effectively changed that whole strategy, but we don't have continuity for iTunes or for any form of media
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.680]  Yeah, we can't just get up with the playlist playing on our Mac just transfer it to our iPhone and keep walking or for watching
[1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:17.520]  Something on the Apple TV and we want to go to bed. We can't just pick up our iPad and you can go manually and chase after the functionality
[1:50:17.520 --> 1:50:20.160]  The way you used to have to do with productivity stuff on iOS
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:23.360]  But it's not yet of that age and I think this is a huge opportunity
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:26.320]  And I don't know how many specific information about whether they're gonna do it now or not
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:29.760]  But there's a lot of stuff that they can just do to catch up and bring all this stuff forward
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:35.440]  I think it'd be really interesting. Yeah, I wonder how some of the continuity stuff could work and with like
[1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:40.320]  It a little bit of proximity awareness, you know, like how much easier could they make?
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:42.720]  You know
[1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:49.520]  Airplay by like I already know you're in the living room and you're watching the video and
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:58.720]  You know, maybe the Apple TV could get ready to receive you know the video so that it the handoff happens much quicker in advance
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:02.560]  I don't know if you've played with handoff on the I on the Apple watch very much
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:05.760]  No, I actually haven't done handoff on the watch that much
[1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:11.880]  It's interesting because there's there's some collision right now because I have a Mac and I have an iPhone and I have my Apple watch and
[1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:15.200]  You can handoff messages or mail or any of that kind of stuff
[1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:21.440]  But my my Mac is broadcasting to so I'll pick up my iPhone and I'll see the Safari icon from my Mac
[1:51:21.440 --> 1:51:26.760]  But then I'll change windows then I'll also see the messages icon from my watch and that sort of thing
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:30.560]  I think they're gonna have to figure out too because now we're not gonna just have an iPhone and an iPad
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:36.400]  We have the Mac and the watch and maybe the Apple TV and who get who gets that slot on the on the box green or in the dock
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:37.600]  Yeah
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:39.040]  All right, let me
[1:51:39.040 --> 1:51:45.760]  Take one last break here and thank our final sponsor and then we'll come back and wrap up the show with with our final thoughts
[1:51:46.480 --> 1:51:48.480]  But our last sponsor and I am
[1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:53.280]  Positively delighted to have them back. It's our good friends at Harry's
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:56.840]  Now you guys know Harry's Harry's makes premium
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:02.680]  Men's shaving products everything from the handles to the razors to the creams
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:06.280]  Anything you need
[1:52:06.760 --> 1:52:15.120]  Really great stuff really great focus on quality design a sort of timeless design that isn't gimmicky
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:19.160]  It doesn't look like a droid ad from Verizon. It just looks like a nice classy
[1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:25.440]  Handel for a razor a nice beautiful box of razor blades
[1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:29.600]  And here's the thing there by cutting out the middle man
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:34.520]  They make them they package them and then they sell them direct to you
[1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:41.480]  So you're not going through some kind of distributor and then distributor puts them in drug stores and then the drug store sells them to you
[1:52:41.480 --> 1:52:45.120]  And it's marked up all along the way and when you're in the drug store
[1:52:45.120 --> 1:52:50.640]  Because people shoplift this stuff you've they've got a behind the glass thing and you've got a hill down a clerk
[1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:55.120]  And then they have to unlock the thing and then you pick it out and then they won't even let you take them
[1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:57.120]  They like walk you to the counter
[1:52:57.320 --> 1:53:02.920]  What a pain in the ass you go to Harry's you sign up you pick the one you want you pick the starting kit you want and
[1:53:03.760 --> 1:53:07.080]  a couple of days later boom the thing arrives in the mail and
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:12.160]  They by cutting out the middle man their prices are just terrific
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:16.160]  So just for example
[1:53:16.520 --> 1:53:19.840]  Here's the thing the blades cost like two dollars or less per pack
[1:53:20.480 --> 1:53:25.040]  Depending on what you do. So for 15 bucks you get you get a pack of eight
[1:53:25.600 --> 1:53:29.080]  You can't get a 15 pack of like Gillette high-end blades
[1:53:29.960 --> 1:53:35.880]  I mean an eight pack for 15 bucks, you know, they're like thirty two dollars or something like that and that's even on Amazon
[1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:39.040]  If you go if you buy 16 at a time
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:44.920]  It's only 25 bucks you're only paying a dollar fifty per blade cartridge and these are the type of cartridges, you know
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:46.920]  There's four blades on the thing and
[1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:53.440]  You know that strip at the top to keep it comfortable comes in beautiful packaging makes you feel really good about it
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  Really really cool stuff
[1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:01.680]  They also have things where you can sign up once you're a happy customer
[1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:04.800]  You can tell them how often you shave how often you go through stuff
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:10.080]  You can sign up get more or less like a subscription and blades just show up on a regular basis
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:12.080]  So you don't even have to remember to reorder
[1:54:12.640 --> 1:54:17.920]  but to get started before you know, you're not going to subscribe before you know how good this stuff is all
[1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:21.280]  You do is you go there you take a look around and you can get these sets
[1:54:21.280 --> 1:54:23.280]  They've got one called the Truman set
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:28.080]  Gives you some shaving cream or gel a handle three blades
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:31.760]  Everything you need to get started 15 bucks. That's it
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:37.520]  They've got the Winston set same type of stuff same three things except the blade is made out of
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:40.160]  Steel instead of plastic
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:44.800]  Really cool stuff and then here's something else timing wise exactly. It's a great idea
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:49.920]  It's called the Father's Day shave set comes in a beautiful box
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:53.640]  You get to pick between foaming gel or shave cream
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.880]  It gives you everything you need to get started with Harry's and
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:04.360]  Just the box alone looks like it's worth it. It's the whole thing is only 40 bucks
[1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:08.400]  Really really great stuff
[1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:12.880]  Again, no brainer. I know it seems like you know like it's like getting your dad a tie
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:15.840]  It's right out of the central cliche, you know get your dad a shaving kit
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:20.000]  But this is so nice and it's so nicely designed. I say go retro and do it
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.480]  It is a great idea. How can you go wrong with it?
[1:55:24.320 --> 1:55:25.360]  Really really cool stuff
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  I encourage you to go and check it out. You just see that just the box alone looks like it's worth 40 bucks
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:31.360]  Don't know how they these guys do it
[1:55:32.880 --> 1:55:34.880]  Where do you go to find out more?
[1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:37.040]  Go to Harries.com

[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:07.840]  You know what I was wrong. It's not 10% you save five bucks. But anyway, that's what you save five bucks
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:11.120]  It check out on your first purchase, but it'll be about 10%
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:18.240]  Depending on what you buy money in your pocket and a fantastic shaving kit
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:21.840]  One last thing on my list of things to talk about
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:26.560]  I don't know if you have anything and maybe it's related to handoff and etc
[1:56:27.040 --> 1:56:31.760]  But one of the most curious pieces of news that have come out to me. You know what I'm gonna say right?
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:34.960]  All right, you say it discovery D discovery D
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:41.280]  Explain discovery D to people who may not be familiar with it
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:44.640]  So Apple did a lot of under the hood stuff with Yosemite
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:47.280]  I think they rewrote launch D they rewrote discovery D and
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:54.480]  My original understanding is that this was a key component for things like continuity and for a world where you do have things like the Apple watch
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:58.080]  And you need to be able to move identify devices and move information
[1:56:58.320 --> 1:57:01.040]  Not just information, but actually activity back and forth between them
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:04.880]  But it was remarkably error-prone. I think rich seagull was my favorite one
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:11.120]  He posted a screenshot showing Apple TV bracket one all the way to 99 or something on his screen
[1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:15.920]  All right, so for example if in the last year you've had an
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:19.680]  Experience where let anything on your home network
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:23.760]  Has suddenly gotten a new name where it was the old name
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:29.920]  parenthesis and an integer like exam perfect example that your Apple TV no longer shows up as Apple TV
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:31.920]  It's now called Apple TV one or
[1:57:33.040 --> 1:57:36.560]  You know Jones iPhone is now Jones iPhone 2
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:40.960]  That's discovery D that's an issue with discovery D
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:45.760]  Or if your other computers on your network no longer show up in the finder like they're just there's not there anymore
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:50.640]  They're only intermittently there. I it does seem like they fixed my problem at some point
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:57.520]  But we had a problem here. I think I talked about it in the show a few months ago with our HP laser jet printer which has
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:03.680]  Bones your support and at first when we first got it a couple years ago
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:06.080]  It was great because we no longer needed
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:12.080]  It just go and set up a printer and it was listed and then it would figure out what it was
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:13.520]  It was almost I swear
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:14.880]  And I know this is retro
[1:58:14.880 --> 1:58:18.000]  But in the old days of met classic Mac OS with the chooser
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:19.440]  And we didn't even have network print
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:23.200]  But you plugged a printer in your computer and you went to the chooser and there it was
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:28.000]  There was the printer and you selected it and then when you went to at whatever app you were using to print
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:31.200]  It would print to that printer and there was no other
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:33.840]  No drivers to install
[1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:37.520]  No telling the computer what printer it is it all identified itself
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.160]  That's how it worked with our laser jet until
[1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:42.800]  You know Yosemite and then all of a sudden
[1:58:43.520 --> 1:58:45.760]  You you printed yesterday
[1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:52.080]  And then you went to print today and it wouldn't print and then you'd go to see where's the printer and it wouldn't even be listed
[1:58:53.440 --> 1:58:58.720]  And one of those fixes was to basically disconnect everything especially Apple TVs and then reconnect it
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:01.920]  And it sounded I don't have the technical acumen to say what this is true
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:06.080]  But it sounded like almost some form of cash poisoning where something would keep a bad list
[1:59:06.080 --> 1:59:09.360]  Yeah, and it would just replicate errors over and over again
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:16.160]  Yeah, and it would maybe like hang on to old ideas of where something should be
[1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:21.600]  But the weird thing about it is it replaced something called M DNS responder
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:27.200]  And the weird thing is is people you know again when I was younger I would have been right there with them
[1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:29.280]  But they're you know people far braver than me
[1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:32.560]  jury rig Yosemite to
[1:59:33.680 --> 1:59:35.680]  turn off discovery D
[1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:40.000]  and replace it with M DNS responder from like
[1:59:42.240 --> 1:59:44.240]  I guess what we have before Mavericks
[1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:48.080]  Yeah, like the last stable version of Mavericks which to me that type of stuff
[1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:51.120]  I can see why it works. I'm not shocked that it works
[1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:57.520]  But to me that sort of doing surgery on the OS is not for me anymore, right? That's a young man's game
[1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:02.880]  But by every account. I've read if there's like sets of instructions out there
[2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:06.160]  I wouldn't recommend following them if you're you know
[2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:12.080]  But there are and by all accounts at work that you could disable discovery D
[2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:17.840]  Go back to Mavericks version of M DNS responder and everything just worked and the weird thing is before that
[2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:23.120]  Before somebody had figured out here's a proven set of instructions to do it the assumption was well
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:26.480]  They replaced and why did they replace M DNS responder?
[2:00:26.480 --> 2:00:33.360]  Which didn't have any of these problems with discovery D which has all of these problems and the consensus was well some of these
[2:00:33.360 --> 2:00:36.800]  Continuity features must depend on it and if you do this
[2:00:36.800 --> 2:00:41.440]  I get I'll bet some of the continuity features aren't gonna work anymore and apparently not
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:45.040]  and so the weird thing is that in
[2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:50.160]  What's still a beta the latest beta of 10 point 10 point four
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:58.320]  That's exactly what Apple has done is that discovery D is no longer there and they've gone back to M DNS responder
[2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:04.720]  It feels like an MDS responder has been around since Jaguar, but it feels like they they needed this
[2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:09.960]  Rewrite or they felt they needed this rewrite and oftentimes people at Apple will complain that they're not allowed to refactor
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:12.160]  Old code or they just don't have the time to refactor it
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:18.080]  But sounds like this went forward and they were given opportunities to fix it and there were fixes that were in almost every point release
[2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:24.240]  And it just got to a point where a decision was made that it's it's not being fixed right enough or fast enough and we're with cutting base
[2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.680]  And I don't know if there's just for now and they're testing it because what weird is this is a beta
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:34.000]  So unless it's in the shipping version. It's not gonna hit everybody
[2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:38.000]  So the shipping version comes out with discovery D back in it
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.560]  Then I don't know what this means that comes back with MS
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:44.040]  You know as responder in it then at least we know that that's been officially changed everywhere
[2:01:44.040 --> 2:01:48.080]  Now MDS or discovery D is also an iOS 8 right?
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:50.240]  I believe so I believe so too
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:54.760]  And I had a friend who said that he was with to this is a friend who does not work at Apple
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:02:03.840]  But I was out with a few Apple folks and joked I bet they replaced discovery D on iOS 2 and and they they just went silent and
[2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:06.160]  One the one Apple guy had to like stifle a laugh
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:10.560]  And I don't know and read that as you may but I mean that you know and they wouldn't it
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:14.400]  No for the words for explained the exchange on the subject, but
[2:02:15.400 --> 2:02:19.720]  There might be something there. I think you started asking you'll just get a clear saying too soon
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:26.920]  I my guess is there's somebody within Apple who's the DRI again directly responsible individual for discovery D
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:33.680]  Who is having trouble sleeping at night and when he wakes up in the morning is covered in sweat
[2:02:34.240 --> 2:02:35.560]  Yes
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:41.560]  Because this sort of thing does not happen like they dapples stubbornly
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:45.800]  Fixes these things rather than go back to
[2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:51.840]  In rollback I come to mobile me right like a rollback like this just is you know
[2:02:51.840 --> 2:02:58.160]  And it's not the hugest deal in the world, but it's just out of character for Apple and and another thing I have heard is
[2:02:58.160 --> 2:03:06.480]  just loosely that in term in the aftermath of this coming out and just like asking around like what the hell
[2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:08.800]  It man that is you know, this is just crazy
[2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:12.160]  Is that
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:18.760]  Discovery D became like the whipping boy for anything and everything wrong with Yosemite
[2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:25.520]  Even if had nothing to do in networking like just it a loose terms from the top
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:30.160]  It's this whole basic idea, you know, and to go back even to Marko's
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:37.840]  Functional high ground thing this whole basic idea that Apple software has become a little less reliable
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:40.720]  with Yosemite
[2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:43.200]  really rank really
[2:03:43.760 --> 2:03:48.560]  Rankled people within Apple all the way up to the top and that you know
[2:03:49.680 --> 2:03:54.640]  I've talked about this, but that you know there were people who not who went to denial about it
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:03:58.280]  But who said wait our open bug count is lower than it's been in years
[2:03:58.280 --> 2:04:03.800]  We've you know, we've been fixing bugs at this incredible rate. This doesn't it doesn't make sense that people think we've been getting less
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:08.520]  Reliable or and we're getting fewer crash reports than ever things are crashing less
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:14.200]  All these ways they have internally of of analytically measuring reliability
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:22.320]  We're saying if somebody was was one of their best releases ever and the conventional wisdom out in user land was that it was one of the worst and
[2:04:22.320 --> 2:04:26.440]  The whole thing came down to its discovery these fall
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:32.040]  Yeah, they were using the wrong metrics to qualify their success, but discovered he became the poster child, right?
[2:04:32.040 --> 2:04:34.560]  And you could just see like in a in a pre-Steve jobs world
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:38.000]  He'd be sitting there with Apple TV 99 and want to throw the control or it's somebody's head
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:44.080]  You know what it actually doesn't it seem like a Steve Jobs decision that at some point there was like it
[2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:49.960]  Obviously wasn't but at some point like you know somebody got started about all these bugs with discovery D
[2:04:49.960 --> 2:04:54.920]  And there's this it frustration and and pride that you're somebody supposed to get and he's just like
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:04:59.680]  Fuck it. We're going back to MD and S responder and everybody in the room is like well
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:05.520]  We don't do that we and and then he leaves and it's like he just said we're going back to MD and S responder and so it's like
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:07.520]  Okay
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:11.440]  And in the old days to bring the show full circle Scott would have said don't worry about it give me two weeks
[2:05:11.440 --> 2:05:12.480]  I'll turn them around
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:16.920]  Yeah, maybe and there's nobody there for that. So that is
[2:05:16.920 --> 2:05:18.360]  a
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:23.440]  Curious story, but in another way though, it's actually sort of makes me feel good
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:25.440]  It's like let's let's not be stubborn
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:29.920]  Let's not be too prideful with the new thing. Let's just go with what works
[2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:33.560]  It's not all doing something. This is no longer off the table, right?
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:37.760]  Because huge and it makes me because the other thing Jeff Williams said at
[2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:42.280]  Recode was confirming that the no it made a bestie case coming for the watch and a lot
[2:05:42.280 --> 2:05:46.880]  Yes, at least I thought that discovery D was instrumental all that kind of stuff that they're doing now with extension
[2:05:46.880 --> 2:05:50.560]  And I you never know what's brand new what's gonna happen
[2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:53.200]  But this kind of culture I think is better is a better environment for it
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:54.280]  I skipped around a little bit
[2:05:54.280 --> 2:05:56.280]  But I did want to say that about the code conference
[2:05:56.280 --> 2:06:02.880]  I thought that was such an interesting thing for him to reveal two weeks before WWDC that they're going to have the native SDK
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:08.880]  Which I really wasn't sure about I know a lot of people thought it was a no-brainer, but I thought
[2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:15.520]  You know watch kid itself is still relatively new that you know, and I know that they said
[2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:17.920]  You know, I'm not on the one hand
[2:06:17.920 --> 2:06:22.640]  I'm a little surprised and you know, then I'm not shocked because they did say it was coming later this year
[2:06:22.640 --> 2:06:26.240]  And if it is coming later this year, why not unveil it at WWDC
[2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:29.120]  Yeah, I think some people think they're gonna actually get the SDK
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:32.680]  But it wasn't clear to me whether it was just a preview or they'll actually be dropping the SDK at this
[2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:39.920]  Yeah, I don't know and then it raises all sorts of questions like how do you install developer releases of the OS on your watch and stuff like that
[2:06:40.920 --> 2:06:44.080]  Special developer version of the Apple Watch app for iPhone
[2:06:44.080 --> 2:06:47.360]  I that's what I would guess right. That's what I would think
[2:06:48.160 --> 2:06:53.560]  Well, the whole thing is brandy like they just had the first Apple watch update very recently the update to I always
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:56.480]  8.3 which I guess are calling Apple watch 1.0.1 and
[2:06:57.440 --> 2:07:01.120]  They had instructions for how to do it because it's very different than updating in the other Apple device
[2:07:01.120 --> 2:07:02.360]  Yeah
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:05.440]  Yeah, because it's all it you can't do it on the device itself
[2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:07.800]  It's all through the watch app on the phone
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:14.000]  So you have to put it if to make sure it's on the charger has more than 50% because they're gonna turn Wi-Fi on full blast to get the data over and
[2:07:14.080 --> 2:07:18.520]  Then you have to you know, you basically watch it on the phone then it switches over to the watch and reboot
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:23.120]  It's an interesting procedure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It went very well for me and seemingly for everybody
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:24.680]  Me too, absolutely
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:30.440]  You have to think that I thought while that happened in the day that it happened that that has to be like such a gigantic
[2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:37.720]  Collective held breath for like Kevin Lynch's team where like no matter how well they've tested it and how confident they are
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:41.800]  It's like putting it out in a real world. There could be you know
[2:07:42.160 --> 2:07:47.120]  Even like that 1% you know like if 1% of the watches got bricked. It's like that is
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:51.080]  That's a failure and it's gonna be a PR disaster
[2:07:51.720 --> 2:08:00.200]  Especially because of the iOS update I think it was 8.1.1 that only affected iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus if you use the delta file update over the air
[2:08:00.200 --> 2:08:06.000]  The full install was fine, but that you know for a first-generation product the first time that happens
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.520]  It's not
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:11.320]  Even though that was terrible. It would be even worse if that happened to the watch for the first update
[2:08:11.320 --> 2:08:16.080]  Right because the first one is the one where the press would you know be able to jump on it and say you know
[2:08:16.360 --> 2:08:21.640]  First first watch update bricks watches and it's like that's that's not a good headline
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:25.840]  Yeah, especially because you don't have as much access to the watch even that you have to an iPhone
[2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:29.080]  I don't know what people would do to start troubleshooting that I think they would I think it's I think it's
[2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  I think a brick OS on the phone aren't on the watch has to go to a store
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:38.280]  I don't think there's any way around it. I really don't because with iOS
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:43.360]  With my iPhone 6 plus I just plug it into iTunes and resort to the previous version and then did a full upgrade
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:50.720]  And it was fine, but I can't do that with an Apple watch right because I don't see how if it gets bricked and during an OS update how they
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:54.120]  Otherwise, they would still have to have some kind of working bluetooth
[2:08:54.120 --> 2:09:01.600]  Or Wi-Fi I don't know one or the other that the that the phone app could still detect it and do it over the air
[2:09:01.600 --> 2:09:03.600]  But I don't know that that's possible
[2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:09.280]  The Apple TV it's look up the micro USB port and you can plug it into iTunes if you really have to but the port on the Apple
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:12.960]  Watch to seal the way yeah the port on the Apple and it's definitely yeah
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.280]  That's a seal that is you know technically if you want to and there's videos out there of how you can do it
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:20.800]  But there's no way that that's ever a troubleshooting step for the customer
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:25.520]  It might be what they do at the store, but it's definitely not ever user-exposable
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:29.560]  Every Apple watch coming right
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:34.120]  And even now they can't and people can't get their hands on them close enough
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:40.640]  It's amazing like our watches just ship, but I think like the you still can't just order a modern buckle for example of Apple.com
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:43.800]  It still says not available right. No, I still I keep hearing July
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:51.000]  Yeah, yeah, so last thing I have on my list is that you and I the watches that you and I both ordered for our personal watches
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:57.200]  Both arrived right around the same time about a week and a half ago. Yeah, the space black link bracelet
[2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:06.040]  I love it. I do I I'm very happy with it. I was torn between this one and the stainlet the regular stainless and
[2:10:06.800 --> 2:10:12.200]  That's the one I got from my review unit and so having won both. I I'm definitely glad that I got this one
[2:10:12.200 --> 2:10:15.000]  I had this stainless steel with no one else from my review unit
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:20.280]  But it was just something about the black and the way that Apple does manufacturing and I understand what some people would think
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:25.240]  Like the gold might be the height of whatever the Johnny I have marked new some powers are with the watch
[2:10:25.320 --> 2:10:29.720]  But for me, this was always the most attractive version just because it's stainless steel
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:32.600]  It's DLC. There's so many things going on with it and the look
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:36.160]  I think you're the one who said that it changed slightly between September and March. I
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:42.240]  I I'm convinced it did. I cannot prove it. I also felt I was in the store
[2:10:43.040 --> 2:10:45.200]  Yesterday or the day before with my son
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:49.040]  He had a hardware problem with his MacBook
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:56.400]  And so while we were there we were looking at the watches to my eyes now the the one in the store is lower
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:11:03.880]  It's under glass and so lighting could be different but to me the demo unit that they have in the store under the glass display
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:06.200]  looked slightly lighter than mine
[2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:09.720]  It looked there's look more like dark gray and mine looks more like black
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:13.120]  But I thought the ones in September definitely looked more like
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:18.000]  darker gray metal and not black, but I could be a mystery membrane
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.400]  I think I have a photo and now looking at it
[2:11:20.400 --> 2:11:24.640]  I can't tell if it's the silver or the black one because and I was sure it was a black one
[2:11:24.640 --> 2:11:26.640]  But it looks so light compared to this one
[2:11:27.280 --> 2:11:29.600]  Sammy that you haven't is that from I'm more?
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:36.400]  I just took an Instagram back when we went to the September events and I went back to look at it and it just looked so light
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:41.280]  Compared to what I have now and maybe doubt whether it was actually the black watch. That's like a photo of yeah
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:43.280]  I that's what I remember thinking in
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:47.520]  I remember and again, I could be wrong. Maybe I was just looking at two stainless steel ones
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.520]  But I remember in September
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:57.360]  Looking at the in the press area and thinking I don't understand why they made both of these because they look almost
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:03.880]  Indistinguishable. They're calling this one stainless and this one space black stainless and they look like the same thing to me
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:10.880]  Whereas the one that's wearing is on my wrist is truly black. It's as black as the display
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:14.000]  It's like what do you call blacked out? I think in a watch, right?
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:17.840]  And the DLC to me the diamond light coating that they use is just terrific
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:21.440]  I've been wearing it nonstop for a week and a half. It still looks like I took it out the box
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:23.720]  Yeah, that's actually true for me too
[2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:28.520]  Whereas the regular stainless definitely develops scratches on the bracelets, you know within a day or two
[2:12:28.520 --> 2:12:31.880]  Which is normal? I should say for a stainless steel like my
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:36.360]  You know my own stainless steel watch, you know, you just get scratches
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:38.040]  It's you know if you look closely at it
[2:12:38.520 --> 2:12:43.880]  You know and whereas this DLC coating really does seem to be keeping it in in in like out of the box condition
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:48.920]  It doesn't feel you mentioned this before. It doesn't feel like metal. It just feels really good
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:54.680]  It really is a weird thing to talk about like we talked to you and I talked about this personally
[2:12:54.680 --> 2:12:59.240]  But it to the touch it has it feels hard like metal
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.120]  But it has like almost a rubbery texture like a non-porous texture
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:09.800]  Like Kryptonian or something. I don't have a definition for it. Yeah, I have to say I really like it
[2:13:10.920 --> 2:13:18.360]  But I ordered it first thing first thing that a little seconds after the store went live and it didn't show up until a week and a half ago
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  So that was a long time
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:25.160]  Yeah, I think this I think was one of the last models to actually ship
[2:13:26.200 --> 2:13:28.200]  Yeah, I think ship last week. Yeah
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:35.400]  Do you know anybody you've got an addition? Have you seen it? There was a guy that that kid in China who put two of them on his dog?
[2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:38.600]  I saw that
[2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:44.680]  Jonathan Geller, yeah, John Geller the of boy genius report got one. Yeah, it looks really nice
[2:13:44.680 --> 2:13:46.680]  I
[2:13:47.400 --> 2:13:52.120]  Don't know if it's out of turn, but on last week's show Dan Fomer and I were talking about how we hadn't
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:57.160]  How we hadn't seen any in a wild and
[2:13:58.360 --> 2:14:03.480]  Then after we published the show is when it seemed like they first started shipping and
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:10.040]  I don't think you'll see many in the while
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:18.360]  Dan alerted me to it. That was the first. I'd seen that Jonathan Geller had gotten his gold apple watch and his
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.080]  DM to me Dan Fomer said boy genius wins the golden turtle
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:31.240]  I don't blame the kid if you got the money go ahead and get it have fun with I don't blame anybody who wants to spend the money out
[2:14:31.240 --> 2:14:41.000]  Yeah, I think he just got married last week or the week before and I think both he and his new bride got them. Well good for them
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:43.480]  That's good somebody
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:48.520]  Listener also texted me that they saw somebody in grand central with the rose gold
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:54.200]  I forget what band might have been a sport band, but a rose gold one with a sport band so
[2:14:54.840 --> 2:15:00.040]  You know, they're definitely starting to ship and I think you know, obviously places like New York City and stuff like that
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:02.040]  Are where you're gonna see him?
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:05.640]  When I was at the I went to the try-ons at the store in Palo Alto
[2:15:05.640 --> 2:15:08.840]  And I went for lunch afterwards and there was just a group of people sitting around
[2:15:09.640 --> 2:15:13.160]  At one of the tables and they were talking about which version of the addition they were gonna get
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:19.480]  There wasn't a question about which watch it was like the rose gold know the yellow gold with this buckle and that that was just their version of the conversation
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:26.200]  Interesting I'm sure for some people again, it's like you know people who get $25,000 playing tickets to
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:29.480]  Singapore or who get $20,000 open to addresses or
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:33.880]  Six or seven-star hotel rooms is just that's the option that they're gonna choose
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  Our world now, I guess not
[2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:45.000]  Anything else that you wanted to talk about before we wrap up the show. I think it did a good job. All right, it's been a busy week
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:47.640]  I will see you soon, right
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:54.840]  All right, cuz I guess I should say cuz there's questions about my eye. I am free to fly. I've been free to fly for over a month
[2:15:54.840 --> 2:15:56.840]  So I'm
[2:15:56.840 --> 2:15:59.480]  Invited to and we'll be at www dc
[2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:06.200]  Likewise be fun. Did they do they didn't do invitations this year like they know you I just got a phone call
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  Yeah, I think some some people on Twitter tried to say they did, but then when I tracked it down
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:17.400]  I didn't find anybody that actually got in the traditional invitation right because I and to my knowledge so nobody has like no
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:19.560]  we don't get to do the
[2:16:19.560 --> 2:16:25.920]  The criminal analogy of trying to read into the invitation design what the topics are gonna be yeah
[2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:28.600]  But I think they would have probably just used that logo that they made for wdc
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:33.080]  Anyways, I did that right so it doesn't I just go to dal rimple site and if he doesn't have a picture there
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:35.320]  I see him. There's no yeah, I just figured nobody got one
[2:16:36.840 --> 2:16:40.680]  All right, Renee everybody can find out more about Renee Richie's work
[2:16:41.560 --> 2:16:46.440]  certainly at imore.com and on Twitter at
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:54.200]  Renee Richie, right at Renee Richie? Yeah, our ENE our ITCH i.e
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:17:02.040]  The podcast that you're on everybody enjoy Richie Renee Richie on a podcast you you're in luck because Renee is on
[2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:05.560]  37 podcasts. I'll let you pick up to five of them
[2:17:06.120 --> 2:17:11.640]  Well, no, we just put the debug live a few minutes ago and it's with the guy in paul kafassus
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:15.000]  Oh, and they have nothing to talk about for about three hours. Where was that from?
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:21.720]  That's on debug and it's no, but where was it recorded live? Oh, we just recorded on Skype. Oh, I got you got you got you
[2:17:21.720 --> 2:17:27.680]  Okay, it's funny because we did the podcast at all and after an hour it felt like forever and talked to horse
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:29.000]  Did you and
