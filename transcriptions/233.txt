[00:00.000 --> 00:02.480]  We are recording on October 31
[00:02.480 --> 00:08.600]  This is the day after the Big Apple event and every other person on my list of guests to have on the show soon is either
[00:09.320 --> 00:15.660]  Traveling home from the Apple event or is going to be out trick-or-treating with their young children
[00:16.440 --> 00:17.680]  and
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.680]  That leaves John waltz
[00:23.440 --> 00:25.440]  It's nice to be on the list
[00:25.520 --> 00:26.020]  No
[00:26.020 --> 00:27.320]  I thought it would be fun that you know
[00:27.320 --> 00:30.840]  You weren't on for a long time and now you're on back-to-back and we can judge how we did
[00:30.840 --> 00:33.440]  We we had a preview. We had a preview show
[00:34.360 --> 00:38.440]  I don't either. Well, let me tell you something. Um, I'm
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.540]  Actually just back from New York. I still stink like
[00:43.220 --> 00:45.220]  like New York
[00:47.320 --> 00:50.400]  That's a heavy stink too, yeah, I haven't watched it well
[00:50.400 --> 00:57.880]  These they played that I love New York song and the thing yesterday and then one I'd never heard that song before I met one
[00:57.880 --> 01:00.000]  Of the lines is I love the New York stinks. I
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.960]  Love the stink of it or something. No, I love New York, but I I literally am fresh off the train
[01:07.320 --> 01:11.000]  but somebody on the on Twitter asked me how my hat tasted and
[01:11.440 --> 01:16.160]  I'm confused because I thought when I said along the last show that I would eat my hat
[01:16.160 --> 01:21.040]  I thought I said I would eat my hat if Adobe didn't get to demo Photoshop for iPad, which they did
[01:21.680 --> 01:24.980]  Yeah, so I don't we said yeah, so I don't think there's any yeah
[01:24.980 --> 01:28.160]  I mean and I don't think there's any way we would have thought that they were not going to do that
[01:28.160 --> 01:29.840]  Yeah, so I don't think there are any hats
[01:29.840 --> 01:33.720]  I'm supposed to eat but if I don't think this is I don't and I don't think that's revisionist history
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.880]  No, so if if if I'm wrong and I need to eat a hat I I was so confident
[01:39.880 --> 01:43.240]  Sure, it's a very make sure it's a tiny hat. I was so confident in
[01:43.240 --> 01:45.240]  In
[01:45.560 --> 01:47.240]  Adobe
[01:47.240 --> 01:52.020]  Being on stage for that to do to do Photoshop for iPad that I didn't even take a hat
[01:54.920 --> 01:58.280]  This will be a quick show but you know to buy one of those fancy New York hats
[01:58.280 --> 02:02.760]  Yeah, exactly. Speaking of getting a small one in case you have to eat it. I got to see
[02:03.680 --> 02:06.640]  I got to see the new palm phone
[02:08.320 --> 02:10.800]  Yeah, did we talk about this last week it's like a little
[02:10.800 --> 02:14.160]  You know, I mean a lot of people have joked that I would get that phone
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.920]  Yeah, it is a it is a little credit card phone
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.100]  I think Dan Fromer and I talked about it then at some point. But yeah, there is a new phone
[02:21.640 --> 02:28.000]  That some company who has purchased the rights to the name palm is calling a palm phone, but it's just an Android phone
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.120]  I can't say who had it. I believe I believe they're under an NDA
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.120]  But you know and you go to these press things you get to see stuff like that
[02:38.120 --> 02:43.080]  You know somebody else was carrying it around and I saw it and it is adorable, but it is it is definitely not
[02:44.280 --> 02:49.800]  Something that you could use as your main phone. I mean, it's the just like whatever the idea right now
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.800]  I mean that the point is that you can
[02:52.160 --> 02:55.280]  Try and disconnect and turn off those things that are distractions
[02:55.280 --> 02:55.720]  Yeah
[02:55.720 --> 03:00.220]  but the battery life or battery life is so bad though that even if you're not using it like like if the
[03:00.360 --> 03:04.340]  You know if you're if somebody is thinking well I could get it because I want to cut down on using my phone
[03:04.340 --> 03:08.760]  like I don't even think that if it was your one and only phone that you could just keep it in your pocket all day and
[03:09.680 --> 03:12.880]  And have it, you know, not even that's a feature so you don't get distracted
[03:13.240 --> 03:18.120]  So not only is the screen too small to really use that's supposed to be on the phone turn the phone
[03:18.120 --> 03:20.120]  Right, it dies at 11 a.m.
[03:20.560 --> 03:22.600]  She just carry around a potato. Yeah
[03:23.480 --> 03:30.320]  It does seem like it is it's not like a piece of junk. It does seem like like a nice little nice little iPhone
[03:30.320 --> 03:36.800]  It really does look like an iPhone had a baby or something. It's it's sort of iPhone ish. That's what I want to happen
[03:36.800 --> 03:39.640]  But yeah, it doesn't have volume buttons
[03:40.720 --> 03:42.400]  Wow
[03:42.400 --> 03:46.080]  Like the only button is the power button and so I said well, how do you turn the volume?
[03:46.320 --> 03:48.320]  How do you change the volume?
[03:48.320 --> 03:55.840]  And I don't know yet so anyway, there should be some good reviews of that coming out soon
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.640]  Did you I I guess I should have asked before you started the show did you watch the event yesterday?
[04:06.960 --> 04:10.640]  That would have been would have been a little awkward if I had not. Yes. I watched the event
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.140]  What did you think as a home viewer? I thought it was pretty good
[04:15.140 --> 04:20.640]  I mean, yeah, I mean as far as the event goes the event was fine. I think the announcements were nice
[04:20.640 --> 04:23.400]  I mean we got to see the things that we were hoping to see and
[04:24.400 --> 04:27.240]  And they turned out pretty well if rather pricey. Yeah
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.800]  And I did there was it was a very rapidly paced event
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.000]  I was talking to some friends at the verge and you know those guys they have you know
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  They're shooting video and they want to get
[04:39.140 --> 04:43.720]  You know, they're so busy after these events. I don't know how they do it because you know, they're in the hands-on area
[04:43.720 --> 04:49.680]  They're getting the footage that they can edit together and then have like an hour, you know narrate a you know
[04:49.680 --> 04:56.580]  Here's what Apple announced today and get all this together and get it out, you know by like early afternoon, but they like to
[04:57.360 --> 05:00.040]  And smart too because they're on this tight deadline
[05:00.040 --> 05:06.560]  so what they like to do is every time there's like at the end of each section when there's the the like summary page like
[05:06.560 --> 05:12.440]  You know iPad new iPad Pro and it comes with you can get 64 or
[05:13.960 --> 05:16.680]  256 512 or 1 terabyte and
[05:17.400 --> 05:22.320]  You know, there's the slide they like to take photos of those slides and have you know
[05:22.320 --> 05:27.820]  Every one of them so that they you know as they're writing they already have, you know, here's the for storage options
[05:27.820 --> 05:29.960]  Here's the starting price blah blah blah. They don't have to sit there
[05:29.960 --> 05:30.240]  Yeah
[05:30.240 --> 05:31.240]  and then I flunk and
[05:31.240 --> 05:36.360]  some of those slides were up so long that they while they were trying to get them like oh here it comes and and was
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.360]  Like up and then gone
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.760]  It was a very quick-moving event on purpose perhaps I don't know I don't know I
[05:47.360 --> 05:50.040]  Almost think like maybe I think the math
[05:51.120 --> 05:57.040]  Yeah, maybe because I do feel like the one of the undercurrents of this that we have to get to is that the prices have
[05:57.120 --> 05:58.320]  gone up
[05:58.320 --> 06:03.920]  If if up means I want to get the latest, you know, I want to get the new iPad Pro
[06:03.920 --> 06:09.680]  Oh, yeah, you can still get a yeah, I mean you can still get an iPad for for fairly cheap actually, but
[06:10.560 --> 06:12.560]  Not a new one. Yeah the
[06:13.360 --> 06:16.800]  So I I was sitting near the front I had
[06:17.700 --> 06:19.600]  put in a I
[06:19.600 --> 06:21.520]  Don't I don't think this is funny actually
[06:21.520 --> 06:27.040]  But at the last event I couldn't I couldn't read the small print on the slides from the back of the theater
[06:27.920 --> 06:28.920]  and
[06:28.920 --> 06:29.840]  I
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.080]  Mentioned this and then they were like, well, you know, we'll get you a seat closer to the front and and I was like
[06:34.080 --> 06:37.160]  Thank you. Like I wouldn't say that I I need like
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  You're sitting on Al Gore's lap
[06:40.720 --> 06:44.520]  Pretty close like so I said like I don't need to be like upfront up front
[06:44.520 --> 06:48.520]  I you know just middle of the theater would be fine, you know, like I you know, I'm not blind
[06:48.920 --> 06:50.120]  But like from the back
[06:50.120 --> 06:54.320]  I definitely can't read the small print and the small print is often what I'm interested in there like don't worry John will take
[06:54.320 --> 06:55.600]  care of you
[06:55.600 --> 06:57.600]  I'm in the third row. I
[06:57.600 --> 07:03.760]  I was literally right behind in the second row right in front of me was the guy with the
[07:03.860 --> 07:07.340]  the camera for the live stream shooting people on stage I
[07:08.420 --> 07:11.940]  Mean, there's also I think there was also sit in front of him Johnny. I've
[07:12.820 --> 07:16.260]  So that was Johnny Ives head that everybody could see I believe so
[07:16.660 --> 07:20.500]  Yeah, it was um, it was slightly distracting
[07:20.500 --> 07:27.740]  I know if it was a bald head it was definitely John it it might have been I can't remember exactly
[07:27.740 --> 07:31.740]  I was watching it on my iPad so it wasn't like huge but it kept it was it was popping up frequently
[07:31.740 --> 07:36.140]  I will try to post a see if any of my photos turned out usable. I
[07:36.980 --> 07:43.640]  Have some photos that sort of show the perspective of the camera guy looking at his display and the camera and Johnny
[07:43.640 --> 07:47.980]  I'm in front of him and whoever was currently speaking on the thing of it. It was pretty good seat
[07:47.980 --> 07:55.900]  So another seating related question, then you were probably close to other Apple people was the was it retail?
[07:55.900 --> 08:01.260]  Do you know if yes retail packed in there? Yes, I know for a fact that it was and they got excellent seats
[08:01.880 --> 08:04.260]  They were all up in a very close to the front
[08:04.900 --> 08:08.700]  Including two young women who were right a friend of the show actually
[08:09.300 --> 08:12.300]  Matthew panzerino sat next to me. He hitchhiked on my
[08:12.300 --> 08:14.300]  I
[08:14.900 --> 08:17.020]  Say yeah, they were like
[08:18.100 --> 08:20.100]  What do you need a friend and I was like, yeah
[08:20.380 --> 08:22.380]  somebody to gossip with during the event
[08:22.580 --> 08:27.340]  But anyway right behind us in the fourth row were a couple of young women clearly from retail
[08:27.900 --> 08:31.380]  And they were super enthusiastic and I just loved it
[08:31.380 --> 08:36.660]  I loved their commentary and it was just it was so genuine and I
[08:36.660 --> 08:42.340]  I feel like in the events in California when the Apple people who are there applaud
[08:42.660 --> 08:48.780]  There's a sort of I wouldn't say it's gross, but there's a phoniness to it and it's it's it's hmm
[08:48.780 --> 08:53.660]  They mourn they more know when they're supposed to applaud and the yeah things that they're supposed to applaud
[08:53.660 --> 08:59.940]  Yeah, whereas the the retail people who filled up and they had you know, they had 2,000 some seats and they don't invite anywhere nearly
[08:59.940 --> 09:06.860]  2,000 press and it you know, whoever makes the the special guest list, you know
[09:06.860 --> 09:08.540]  It doesn't add up close to 2,000
[09:08.540 --> 09:12.740]  So they had hundreds and I don't know how many you know retail people they had there but easily hundreds
[09:13.940 --> 09:21.140]  super enthusiastic throughout the whole thing clearly aren't like the sort of even though they work in an Apple retail store and obviously are like
[09:21.580 --> 09:24.780]  Good enough at it that they got chosen, you know, I don't know
[09:24.780 --> 09:29.580]  I don't you know, I presume it was some kind of reward for being a good employee
[09:29.580 --> 09:34.420]  But they didn't know anything about what was coming up
[09:34.420 --> 09:38.460]  so like for example, when when they announced the iPad Pro and they said
[09:39.460 --> 09:41.460]  for reason X Y & Z
[09:41.540 --> 09:47.500]  the switch into USB C and they were like no whoa and and then
[09:48.860 --> 09:54.740]  When they showed how because it's a USB C port you can now charge your iPhone from your iPad
[09:54.740 --> 10:00.660]  They were these two young women. They were like I am losing my mind. It was so
[10:01.940 --> 10:05.700]  During this. I don't know if you could hear it on the live stream, but during the NBA game demo
[10:06.340 --> 10:10.780]  When Steph hit the three Steph Curry hit the three-pointer shield go staff
[10:14.060 --> 10:16.060]  So after the thing was over
[10:16.620 --> 10:22.100]  Panzarino and I turned around and introduced ourselves and we're and they were just like what do you guys do you guys write write blogs?
[10:22.100 --> 10:26.900]  And they'd heard of TechCrunch and and they were like, oh, that's awesome. And we're like, well, what are you guys doing?
[10:26.900 --> 10:28.900]  They work in retail actually in
[10:29.420 --> 10:35.100]  They weren't even from New York. They were from suburban square, which is a suburb of Philadelphia. I was like, I'm from Philly
[10:35.100 --> 10:39.580]  I know the suburban square store before we had ones in Philadelphia. That's one of the ones I used to have to go to
[10:40.900 --> 10:42.900]  Said it's a very nice store
[10:42.940 --> 10:46.260]  But that's cool that they brought they brought people from more or less the whole eastern seaboard
[10:46.260 --> 10:54.300]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's somehow it seemed like it was retail people. I can't exactly remember. There was some well when it was when Angela
[10:54.700 --> 10:59.940]  Yeah, she got crazy. Yeah a crazy amount of applause for lots of things
[10:59.940 --> 11:04.140]  Yeah, so that I think that was yeah, then what tipped me off there? Yeah
[11:06.380 --> 11:08.580]  Yeah, so that was cool and I think it was a great idea
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.180]  Because again, the enthusiasm was genuine
[11:12.180 --> 11:16.540]  I think that these are people who you know, they're not the least bit jaded by these things, you know
[11:16.540 --> 11:19.300]  None of them I'm almost certain had ever been to one of these before
[11:19.300 --> 11:21.420]  I'm sure all of them had you know
[11:21.420 --> 11:24.100]  It's the sort of thing that if you're an enthusiastic Apple store employee
[11:24.100 --> 11:29.340]  You'd like to and I think it was a fun show and it was a little cold in New York yesterday
[11:29.340 --> 11:35.180]  But I still a nice day and and for if all the retail people are from more or less the Northeast
[11:35.180 --> 11:47.180]  You know, they're used to it all the California people from Apple were dying
[11:48.540 --> 11:52.100]  Somebody I know and I will be art she was wearing this it was it wasn't that cold
[11:52.100 --> 11:56.740]  It was like 46 degrees Fahrenheit, you know, it's a chilly day a little bit of wind. She was wearing a parka
[11:56.740 --> 12:02.740]  She had the hood. Oh, she looked like Kenny on on the what's that cartoon called South Park, you know
[12:02.740 --> 12:07.620]  She had the parka up over her head and cinched. So she's just looking at the thing and
[12:08.460 --> 12:14.380]  She's shivering and I'm just like why why don't you go inside like dude and she's like I need to greet people
[12:17.020 --> 12:19.020]  Torture watching it I
[12:19.540 --> 12:23.220]  Thought it was cool. It was a very it's a beautiful, you know, everybody, you know, no surprise
[12:23.220 --> 12:27.980]  The Brooklyn Academy music is a beautiful theater. They had the hands-on area around the corner
[12:27.980 --> 12:34.580]  You didn't even have to cross the street in this I forget the name of it one Hudson place. It's like a former bank
[12:34.580 --> 12:37.100]  Like a turn-of-the-last-century bank
[12:38.820 --> 12:44.820]  Yeah, you know like the way that did they just don't build banks like that anymore right like a cathedral a cathedral to money
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.500]  Carved ceiling and stained glass
[12:49.300 --> 12:52.420]  It's funny that none of them. Yeah, I mean none of those are I mean well
[12:52.420 --> 12:58.740]  No, I shouldn't say none of them, but most of them are not banks anymore. No, they're either they're all like steak houses or nightclubs
[12:58.740 --> 13:03.980]  Yeah, steak houses nightclubs and this one Hudson place is just sort of like a rental event space
[13:05.700 --> 13:11.300]  But that was right around the corner and it was a beautiful space and then there's the Brooklyn
[13:11.300 --> 13:13.300]  I don't know if it's got a name, but it's the
[13:14.020 --> 13:17.540]  The Apple Store they showed it on one of Angela aren't slides. It's
[13:17.540 --> 13:24.580]  It's on like a little wedge shaped block. So it's sort of like like the Flatiron building in New York where it's you know
[13:24.580 --> 13:28.740]  It's a triangle shape building by necessity and it's just gorgeous architecture
[13:28.740 --> 13:34.940]  It is apparently the building Apple didn't build the building they inherited it, but they you know did a little work
[13:36.220 --> 13:42.780]  And it is just gorgeous in terms of taking advantage like making that triangle shape seem like the most natural thing in the world
[13:43.940 --> 13:47.220]  Very cool. All right. Well, we'll get into the details
[13:47.220 --> 13:51.300]  Um, but I want to keep moving. So let's I'm gonna take a break here and thank our first sponsor
[13:51.300 --> 13:53.400]  And this is kind of amazing. This is a new sponsor
[13:54.740 --> 13:57.740]  I'm really impressed by this. I can't wait. I can't wait to tell you about it
[13:59.860 --> 14:05.620]  Yeah, I don't know about you I've I've I've never done this but maybe some of you have thought about it training for an Ironman
[14:05.940 --> 14:07.480]  triathlon
[14:07.480 --> 14:13.100]  Now if you don't know what it's Ironman triathlon is it is a 2.4 mile open water swim
[14:13.100 --> 14:19.100]  And then you ride 112 miles on a bike and after that you run a full
[14:19.460 --> 14:22.740]  26.2 mile marathon. It is a full day of effort
[14:23.780 --> 14:25.380]  and
[14:25.380 --> 14:30.720]  To get to a fitness level that allows you to even compete in one you need to train. I think that's pretty obviously
[14:31.340 --> 14:34.380]  And most experts think you need to train for a minimum of 24 weeks
[14:34.380 --> 14:40.340]  And that is what Ian Blackburn did and he did it using Apple watch now just to be clear
[14:40.340 --> 14:44.160]  Ian is not a lifetime athlete. He has a family
[14:44.160 --> 14:47.660]  He has a job and he was not out to break records or compete in a world championship
[14:48.380 --> 14:51.520]  He just wanted to do an Ironman triathlon
[14:52.900 --> 14:57.580]  Wanted to be fit wanted to lose a little weight and it's just a a challenge. He's always had for himself
[14:57.580 --> 15:01.860]  So he complete he competed one completed one on September 9th this year
[15:01.940 --> 15:05.860]  You got a time of 15 hours 33 minutes, which I think is actually pretty good. I
[15:05.860 --> 15:10.100]  I think if you finish that's pretty good because I'll tell you what I would drown in the first
[15:18.740 --> 15:25.820]  But you can read all about it on his blog and the blog has a great title you're gonna remember this it's the Apple watch
[15:26.500 --> 15:28.060]  triathlete.com
[15:28.060 --> 15:34.720]  The Apple watch triathlete.com now if you're thinking about doing this or maybe you've already done triathlon, but you want to train better
[15:34.720 --> 15:36.720]  you
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.300]  Can do this there's all sorts of dedicated sports watches that are just for triathlons and there's
[15:43.680 --> 15:45.640]  other fitness devices
[15:45.640 --> 15:50.520]  And maybe you have an Apple watch too and you're sick of it and you'd rather just do it all on your Apple watch
[15:50.520 --> 15:50.880]  well
[15:50.880 --> 15:51.480]  Ian
[15:51.480 --> 15:53.280]  Has gathered all of his knowledge
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.200]  From the last year of his training and actually running in one of these competing in one of these and he's put it in form
[15:58.200 --> 16:03.620]  In a digital book for anybody who was interested in this to train from he covers all three of the sports swimming
[16:03.620 --> 16:09.300]  including doing the training in indoor pools or open water cycling on the road and
[16:10.740 --> 16:12.740]  training at home using
[16:14.380 --> 16:17.300]  You know like a treadmill or something like that with the running
[16:17.540 --> 16:21.980]  Or any any way that you could train for a triathlon whether you're actually running outside whether you're using a treadmill
[16:22.940 --> 16:26.660]  Whether maybe you're even doing the cycling as part of your commute something like that
[16:26.660 --> 16:31.060]  He's got tips for ways to integrate this into your triathlon training across the board
[16:31.060 --> 16:34.260]  using the Apple watch and he examines the
[16:34.780 --> 16:42.140]  built-in workout app and he recommends third-party apps where the Apple one may fall short or just may not be perfectly optimized for the needs of
[16:42.340 --> 16:44.340]  in training triathlete
[16:45.620 --> 16:48.480]  How to understand the data how to look at the heart rate
[16:49.260 --> 16:52.140]  Variability all that stuff. It's got all this all this great stuff
[16:52.180 --> 16:57.740]  He also includes with the book for free training plans from 8 to 24 weeks
[16:57.740 --> 17:02.900]  for sprint Olympic half Ironman and full Ironman
[17:03.260 --> 17:07.740]  triathlons and these workouts are provided by his coach John Rowland who
[17:08.140 --> 17:13.780]  These are these are professionally designed training plants and they can usually run up to 100 bucks each. So this is a great offer
[17:14.900 --> 17:22.260]  And if you purchase the book you also get access to a private slack group to discuss tips and tricks with other keen Apple watch
[17:22.660 --> 17:24.420]  triathletes
[17:24.420 --> 17:31.460]  developers are welcome to if you want to join and get feedback from the group or get beta testers or something like that if you've
[17:31.460 --> 17:36.220]  Got a fitness app for Apple watch. So go to the Apple watch triathlete.com add
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.980]  The how to train like an Ironman with Apple watch book
[17:41.260 --> 17:46.820]  it's an e-book add it to your basket and enter the code the talk show with the
[17:46.820 --> 17:54.560]  The and again, this is just an amazing deal add that code at checkout and you save 60% off the published price by
[17:54.900 --> 17:58.820]  Pre-ordering before the book is released on December 3rd. So you've got time as

[18:17.620 --> 18:21.580]  triathlete.com promotion code the talk show so anybody interested in
[18:22.580 --> 18:26.820]  Ironman triathlons half triathlons, etc. Go check it out. It's great deal. I
[18:29.540 --> 18:31.900]  Was I was really worried when this sponsor came out
[18:31.900 --> 18:36.200]  I'm excited about it because it's different and I love having different sponsors, but a lot of times they want you to try it
[18:36.200 --> 18:45.160]  You know what I mean sleep on the pillow, you know, we're gonna send you a pillow you guys sleep on I don't care
[18:45.160 --> 18:48.720]  I'll sleep on anything. You know what I mean? I may you know, I mean I keep it but I'll sleep on the pillow
[18:48.720 --> 18:50.720]  It's sleeping. I'll try it
[18:54.840 --> 19:01.400]  Bicycling 26 miles this episode would not be taking place if I had tried to swim 2.4 my I
[19:01.400 --> 19:05.760]  I mean I can swim I I didn't you know, yeah
[19:05.760 --> 19:10.700]  I swim a length of a like a hotel pool though, and that's you know, who John's done for the day
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Filled your ring there
[19:17.440 --> 19:19.480]  Alright so the event let's just keep it going
[19:19.480 --> 19:24.640]  So what was the what was the first thing that started with the Mac? All right first was Tim Cook, right?
[19:24.640 --> 19:27.180]  I thought Tim Cook was really
[19:27.180 --> 19:34.040]  Great. I thought it might have been his I don't know why I just seemed to me in the audience that he seemed
[19:34.880 --> 19:41.320]  Relaxed and happy and enthusiastic. I didn't really notice that and other people had said that to me though and thinking back
[19:41.320 --> 19:43.320]  It does seem like that. Yeah
[19:43.840 --> 19:50.640]  You know, I think he's gotten he continues to get better and better at being the the host of these shows
[19:50.640 --> 19:58.120]  It's a you know, among all the different ways that replacing Steve Jobs is difficult, you know
[19:58.480 --> 20:02.640]  Replacing him as the guy who comes out at these Apple events is got to be
[20:03.640 --> 20:08.720]  It's certainly not the most frequent right because it's you know, what three four times a year maybe
[20:09.480 --> 20:14.600]  You know, whereas there's other aspects of his job as CEO that are every single day, you know
[20:14.840 --> 20:17.840]  You know from when he wakes up until he goes to goes to sleep
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.580]  But this is the one that's obviously the highest profile
[20:20.980 --> 20:27.220]  And I really think he continues to come into his own and I think I I guess another way to put it
[20:27.220 --> 20:29.220]  Is it really seemed to me like he enjoyed it yesterday?
[20:29.580 --> 20:34.300]  Yeah, and and you know, I think he clearly ad-libbed the I maybe I'll move to New York
[20:39.060 --> 20:44.740]  Because I really do feel and I mean it I think even from his perspective on stage I feel like this sort of
[20:44.740 --> 20:50.300]  More genuine energy level of the retail folks in the audience really came across
[20:51.540 --> 20:55.620]  And it was funny too. It would be great if they could do that all the time instead of what they do
[20:55.620 --> 20:57.500]  Yeah, California and no offense
[20:57.500 --> 21:02.620]  No offense to anybody who's listening as it was an Apple employee in California and who was you know
[21:02.620 --> 21:08.260]  Like maybe you work on Apple watch and you were in the theater for the last month's announcement of the series 4
[21:08.260 --> 21:10.460]  I'm not I'm not saying you were a bad
[21:10.460 --> 21:16.060]  Maybe the more reserved attitude in California is also just because they know more about what's being announced
[21:16.580 --> 21:22.460]  And the P the retail people have absolutely no idea. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't know it's really cool
[21:23.100 --> 21:25.220]  I also thought that his
[21:26.260 --> 21:31.500]  His his enthusiasm for the Mac Mini and especially the MacBook Air was was
[21:32.220 --> 21:34.220]  Sincere, you know and I think I
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.660]  Think it's a weird
[21:36.780 --> 21:38.700]  especially the MacBook Air
[21:38.700 --> 21:43.980]  Although it's good that the Mac Mini is alive and well and totally refreshed. That's great
[21:44.420 --> 21:46.300]  It's it's clearly though
[21:46.300 --> 21:50.620]  You know the MacBook Air and I thought it was great that he made it clear that this is he called it
[21:50.620 --> 21:55.340]  This is our most beloved Mac. This is the Mac that most people use and they have the most affection for
[21:57.100 --> 22:02.620]  It's you know, I don't know what percentage of their overall Mac cells or MacBook Airs, but I think it's just off the charts
[22:02.820 --> 22:04.820]  yeah, it has to be and
[22:04.820 --> 22:10.800]  You know, well, then why did it go so long between updates right and I you know, we can get to that
[22:10.800 --> 22:13.300]  I think they don't really have an answer
[22:13.300 --> 22:20.460]  They certainly don't have a public answer and even talking to folks off the record privately after the event
[22:20.860 --> 22:26.420]  They don't really have they're not gonna come out and say it in so many words, but I kind of reading between the lines
[22:26.420 --> 22:27.740]  I think I kind of get it
[22:27.740 --> 22:32.700]  like it's not about not having affection for the product or not caring about it or
[22:32.700 --> 22:37.540]  Having a disregard for the people who want to buy it. It's it's more complicated than that
[22:40.740 --> 22:42.740]  But I think it's a really cool update
[22:43.140 --> 22:48.380]  Yeah, yeah. I mean it's such a cool update and maybe it's a little well, I mean
[22:49.100 --> 22:52.420]  It's a higher price than I'd like but yeah it but it really
[22:53.060 --> 22:57.240]  Makes you wonder why the MacBook is still in the lineup. Yeah, well
[22:57.240 --> 23:03.280]  And I know what their line is their line is some people want the lightest. Yeah laptop possible
[23:03.280 --> 23:08.640]  But the difference isn't that great, right? Well, it's three-quarters of a pound which adds up it
[23:09.040 --> 23:12.000]  I didn't get to see one when you carry eight of them, I guess
[23:16.520 --> 23:21.920]  They didn't have any side-by-side they only you know, the only products they had in the hands-on area are were the new ones
[23:21.920 --> 23:29.280]  Although they did have some some MacBook pros for some of the stations, but they didn't have any rate
[23:29.280 --> 23:33.760]  You know 12-inch MacBooks for comparison, I think because you know, oh, this is so small and light
[23:33.760 --> 23:37.360]  well, here's one that's smaller and lighter, you know that they're not gonna show that but I
[23:38.080 --> 23:43.960]  I do and I know that there's a I think our audience in our Twitter universe
[23:43.960 --> 23:46.320]  You know the people who follow me and I you know
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.120]  I've see this this is a very very common question for me on Twitter in the last 24 hours is
[23:51.120 --> 23:55.360]  who the hell's buying this 12-inch MacBook now, it's more cost more and slower and
[23:56.160 --> 24:03.260]  The air is fine in terms of size and weight and has a retina screen and I just do think that there is an audience
[24:03.260 --> 24:07.080]  I really do think that I would have I was told, you know
[24:07.080 --> 24:11.160]  We're not going to tell you the numbers but there is a it is definitely worth it for us to keep this in the lineup
[24:11.160 --> 24:13.160]  because there's a market of
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.360]  people who
[24:14.360 --> 24:22.360]  will pay a premium in terms of performance and price right because it's you're you're paying more and getting less of a
[24:22.360 --> 24:25.460]  Computer in terms of you know, how fast the CPU is etc
[24:26.240 --> 24:28.240]  Just to have smaller and lighter
[24:28.680 --> 24:36.200]  That's I wouldn't I don't think especially I really you know, it doesn't I mean, I mean, I don't know
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.160]  I mean, maybe there are people who are concerned about that, but that that's
[24:39.160 --> 24:44.600]  a small difference in weight, but it's not me
[24:44.600 --> 24:50.720]  well, and the other the other question that goes with that particular device is why wasn't it updated and
[24:51.440 --> 24:58.120]  You know again Apple does doesn't talk about products that haven't been up or they don't explain why a product wasn't updated
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.800]  It remains remains a product. All right, it's it's it's a different product cycle
[25:03.160 --> 25:08.480]  This is more or less what you can get it's on a different cycle, but it does use entirely different Intel chips
[25:08.480 --> 25:16.240]  It uses these Intel m3 chips and I this is not the podcast to go to for any kind of technical analysis of Intel's product
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.840]  Line, I just don't care anymore. I used to know it
[25:18.840 --> 25:24.160]  I used to know a lot about it the ATP listen to ATP because those guys know it and they'll tell you all about it
[25:24.160 --> 25:25.840]  But but basically, you know
[25:25.840 --> 25:31.520]  I think that the the 12-inch MacBook uses something called the m3 and the M is for mobile and it's you know
[25:31.640 --> 25:37.760]  It's what it allows that the MacBook not to have a fan and get it because it's sort of more like
[25:37.760 --> 25:42.600]  Intel's attempt at something like the a-12 or a-11, you know
[25:43.760 --> 25:45.000]  and
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.120]  Supposedly the these chips that are in the new MacBook Air which Intel is calling a core i5
[25:51.160 --> 25:53.160]  It's you know, and it's the eighth generation
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.920]  Whatever so I've seen some people who seem to know a lot more about this me say well, it's sort of a Dodge
[25:59.920 --> 26:05.480]  It's like a marketing thing because it would there'd be more they'd be more aptly called the m5 that they're more like mobile
[26:05.480 --> 26:10.360]  I who knows, you know, yeah, I well some people know but I don't care
[26:11.520 --> 26:16.160]  It's faster. The air is faster than the MacBook, but it's not as fast as a MacBook Pro
[26:16.160 --> 26:22.800]  It's exactly what you would think based on the product marketing and the price and you know, I complain about the price but the price is
[26:23.320 --> 26:25.320]  priced accordingly
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.360]  Compared to those devices I would say. Yeah, and it hits that it hits that spot because you
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.360]  You
[26:33.520 --> 26:37.920]  You're forced into it forces you perfectly into awkward choices, it would have been nice
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.940]  It would it would have been nice if they could have said and you know
[26:41.940 --> 26:45.960]  The entry-level model with 8 gigs of RAM and 128
[26:46.920 --> 26:48.920]  gigs of storage is
[26:49.140 --> 26:53.540]  999 and the old MacBook Air is gone. That would have been nice
[26:55.080 --> 26:59.280]  But it's not it's 1199, you know, it's 200 more bucks
[26:59.280 --> 27:04.720]  but I think the good news is that now that we've seen the future of the MacBook Air and a totally
[27:04.720 --> 27:10.820]  You know every single bit of it from the footprint to the silhouette to the keyboard to the display
[27:12.120 --> 27:18.080]  This is obviously the future of the MacBook Air and now we can see the clear path to where this will be 999
[27:18.520 --> 27:23.840]  Yeah a year from now, you know, I don't know probably, you know, I mean they they have
[27:23.840 --> 27:26.580]  I think there have been times before when the lowest priced
[27:26.580 --> 27:33.640]  Laptop was 1,100 bucks. Yeah. Well, it'll at least be cheaper than it is now. It will get cheaper. Yeah
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.360]  You know, so that's the you know
[27:36.360 --> 27:42.040]  it's not good news if you need one right now and you're really kind of hoping to either get one for 999 or
[27:42.540 --> 27:46.320]  to get more for $1,200, you know if you were hoping to get like
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.560]  256 gigs of storage or something like that. Mm-hmm
[27:50.600 --> 27:54.160]  I think for a lot of people I think one of the big differences
[27:54.160 --> 27:57.840]  I really do think that most of the people who are even thinking about a MacBook Air
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.820]  Really aren't looking at CPU performance on the Mac as a thing that affects their work
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.000]  like I really think that anybody who's really pressing the CPU is probably
[28:09.520 --> 28:11.680]  Always in the market from a MacBook Pro
[28:12.560 --> 28:18.520]  Or has some other workflow, you know, like they showed yesterday they had this in the hands-on station
[28:18.520 --> 28:21.160]  They had like they showed how you can configure Xcode
[28:21.160 --> 28:25.720]  where you can be like coding in a coffee shop on a MacBook Air and
[28:26.160 --> 28:32.180]  You save and you tell Xcode to build and instead of building there on your your MacBook Air
[28:32.720 --> 28:36.280]  It if you have Xcode set up at home on a Mac Mini doesn't even need a display
[28:36.280 --> 28:37.360]  It can be completely headless
[28:37.360 --> 28:43.840]  You can have a Mac Mini or any other Mac that you're at home do all the all the computationally expensive stuff
[28:43.840 --> 28:50.580]  And you know if you have like a couple of iPhones and iPads hooked up to it, you know as testing devices
[28:50.580 --> 28:56.160]  It can run like a whole series of tests on those devices with builds for each one and do all of this
[28:56.160 --> 29:01.720]  you know remotely and it's you know, meanwhile the CPU on your MacBook Air and a coffee shop is
[29:03.160 --> 29:06.000]  Exercising itself blinking the cursor and Xcode, right?
[29:07.200 --> 29:12.240]  You know, so so there's ways around it if if your work is performance, you know and and other, you know
[29:12.240 --> 29:18.560]  They had like another setup for video people who you know might stack five Mac Minis on top of each other
[29:18.560 --> 29:25.280]  And then when they were, you know finished editing a video they can send it to to those Mac Minis and each you know
[29:25.280 --> 29:30.000]  too because you need to like the big thing video people have to deal with is they need like once they're done editing they
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.240]  Need like eight different versions of different formats and sizes
[29:33.760 --> 29:38.900]  You can just send that to like five Mac Minis and they all work on it in parallel and spit it out, you know
[29:40.600 --> 29:42.560]  Yeah
[29:42.560 --> 29:47.240]  the other thing in the lineup the other thing in the Mac lineup that sticks out is the
[29:47.240 --> 29:54.400]  The 13-inch MacBook Pro without touch bar. Mm-hmm both price wise and feature wise
[29:54.400 --> 30:00.460]  you know aka the MacBook escape because it has an escape key and the thing that really sticks out about it to me is
[30:01.760 --> 30:06.280]  All the other all the MacBook pros with a touch bar got updated a couple months ago in July
[30:06.720 --> 30:10.920]  except the one without the touch bar didn't get updated this week and
[30:10.920 --> 30:16.960]  And it what does it cost like $12.99? I think I think it starts at $12.99
[30:17.840 --> 30:20.000]  I'm almost certain it starts at $12.99
[30:21.080 --> 30:26.960]  Which is $100 more than the MacBook Air. It is faster there. It's with even without an update
[30:26.960 --> 30:31.200]  I was told unequivocally it is a faster computer at there's there's almost
[30:31.640 --> 30:36.120]  There's no benchmark you could get that's gonna make the MacBook Air with the same amount of RAM
[30:36.960 --> 30:39.220]  perform better than that MacBook escape
[30:39.220 --> 30:41.380]  It is faster
[30:41.380 --> 30:45.540]  But the thing that really sticks out to me is that it doesn't have the touch ID
[30:45.820 --> 30:51.360]  Because the keyboard on the new MacBook Air seems to be the keyboard that an awful lot of people have been begging Apple to make
[30:51.380 --> 30:55.380]  Which is I don't want the touch bar. I don't want to pay for the touch bar
[30:55.380 --> 30:58.500]  I don't think I'll use the touch bar, but I want that fingerprint sensor
[30:58.500 --> 31:02.180]  So can I have the old function keys and a nice escape key in the corner?
[31:02.220 --> 31:06.540]  But give me that fingerprint sensor and they've that that's what this device has
[31:06.540 --> 31:11.980]  But that man 13 inch MacBook Pro that doesn't have it and yet it costs more that kind of sticks out
[31:12.780 --> 31:16.140]  Yeah, so I don't know if that machine is here for the long run
[31:16.140 --> 31:19.940]  I think one one side looking at it is that that machine is is gonna go away
[31:21.380 --> 31:28.500]  Yeah, and the other side was that maybe Apple likes to keep it around just so they can say that the MacBook Pro lineup starts
[31:28.500 --> 31:30.340]  at $12.99
[31:30.340 --> 31:32.680]  That doesn't seem like something Apple would would would
[31:32.680 --> 31:37.920]  You know, well the question I mean, I guess the part of the question though is what is what is the future of the touch?
[31:37.920 --> 31:39.400]  Bar. Yeah
[31:39.400 --> 31:41.400]  because that
[31:42.760 --> 31:46.360]  Will change a lot of this equation, yeah, and again Apple you can ask like well
[31:46.360 --> 31:51.200]  Why doesn't you know, why don't you have the option of a touch bar in a MacBook Air, you know?
[31:51.840 --> 31:57.320]  And you know and they don't they're not gonna come nobody's gonna come out and say look it had to be cheaper
[31:57.840 --> 32:02.560]  You know, but effectively that's the answer, you know, like you listen to what they say and it's like, okay
[32:02.560 --> 32:06.560]  Yeah, whatever the touch bar costs. It's you know, it would have kept it from cost this
[32:06.560 --> 32:08.560]  That's one of the reasons this device is $11.99
[32:09.280 --> 32:10.440]  Yeah
[32:10.440 --> 32:11.520]  I don't know
[32:11.520 --> 32:16.440]  Do you mean do you get the sense that they they have like some sort of vision for the touch bar or or that?
[32:16.440 --> 32:19.120]  that it was just an idea that they had at the time and tried it and
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.680]  Doesn't seem like it's gonna work out. I think it's a great idea in general
[32:24.680 --> 32:29.800]  I I think that a bunch of fiddly little keys f1 f2 f3 f4
[32:29.800 --> 32:37.520]  Is a really 1978 computer idea and so Apple obviously thought that too because you know for a very long time
[32:37.680 --> 32:42.440]  Now they've all defaulted not to being F keys unless you hold down the function
[32:42.440 --> 32:48.680]  You know the little FN key and they default to features like brightness and you know keyboard brightness and volume. I
[32:49.760 --> 32:56.360]  Think that replacing them is you know, those keys with a touchscreen type thing is a good idea in principle
[32:56.360 --> 33:01.840]  I just don't know that the the touch bar as we know it is the right answer friend of the show and our mutual friend
[33:01.840 --> 33:06.880]  Craig Hockenberry has had a great idea that he proposed on a slack and that you and I are on a
[33:07.280 --> 33:13.760]  Couple weeks ago where he his idea was it should be more like the control strip from the right Mac OS 9 Mac OS 8 era
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.520]  There's a there's a hack that can do that
[33:16.520 --> 33:22.840]  I forget the name of it, but I downloaded it and tried it out and it was it was very fiddly and
[33:22.840 --> 33:25.360]  I'm sort of like beyond my
[33:26.160 --> 33:32.200]  Patience to try to configure but it shipped with a bunch of defaults and I tried a couple of defaults and they were
[33:32.660 --> 33:35.320]  They were nice and I think they were probably better
[33:35.760 --> 33:41.300]  some of it some of it concerned me because for some reason the weather widget that they had for it was like using a
[33:41.300 --> 33:43.300]  Russian weather site and I was like
[33:44.320 --> 33:50.360]  Not sure what's going on in the background here. So I ended up uninstalling it but I think that's completely right
[33:50.360 --> 33:55.880]  I think a control strip would be much more useful for a broader group of people
[33:55.880 --> 34:01.600]  Yeah, and and the weird thing about the whole thing is that it seems like it's really more
[34:02.320 --> 34:06.120]  appropriate for just sort of general users rather than
[34:07.280 --> 34:13.720]  Pro users. Yeah, because the pro users are up in arms because they want to have physical keys because they they're the ones who actually rely
[34:13.720 --> 34:16.960]  On those yeah function keys. Yeah, so I don't know
[34:16.960 --> 34:20.700]  I'm optimistic because I feel like Apple is not a company to
[34:21.080 --> 34:25.800]  They they I feel like they're one of their strengths is that they recognize their mistakes
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.960]  You know and it may take them a long time and they may be completely silent until that
[34:29.960 --> 34:34.380]  You know, they don't they don't acknowledge them until they have you know, here here's the answer, you know
[34:34.720 --> 34:40.360]  Yeah, they they very rarely do what they did with the Mac Pro, you know last year and say, okay
[34:40.360 --> 34:47.040]  Yeah, kind of we kind of we kind of missed this whole move to GPUs and back painted ourselves in a thermal corner, etc
[34:47.040 --> 34:49.760]  Etc. We go. So we're back to the drawing board. We're gonna make an all-new Mac Pro
[34:49.760 --> 34:54.040]  It's gonna be awesome and you have to wait like another two years. Yeah, they don't do that very often
[34:54.840 --> 35:01.000]  So but I'm optimistic that it's just software right the touch bar is just software so they could they could write they could do something
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.220]  Different or improve what they have in a radical way and because it's just software everybody would get it
[35:06.220 --> 35:10.300]  Yeah, and when I got it, it felt to me like watch
[35:11.020 --> 35:13.020]  Watch zero watch with you know
[35:13.660 --> 35:15.660]  watch OS one and I thought
[35:16.620 --> 35:20.220]  Well that you know, it's it showed promise and it just but it needs to be
[35:20.780 --> 35:22.660]  It needs to be taken to the next level
[35:22.660 --> 35:22.900]  Yeah
[35:22.900 --> 35:24.900]  and they eventually did that with the watch and
[35:25.100 --> 35:30.940]  I get the sense now looking back on the watch that they probably had an idea that it really was gonna be like a health
[35:31.220 --> 35:33.900]  You know a much more health centric, but they didn't have
[35:33.900 --> 35:38.600]  All that stuff ready up front and they wanted to ship it. Yeah when they had it
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.580]  Yeah, and so they worked that in but but I kind of get the sense that they did know that at the beginning
[35:44.500 --> 35:50.600]  And I maybe there's the same thing going on here and that other shoe will drop eventually, but right now
[35:50.600 --> 35:51.500]  I just don't know what it is
[35:51.500 --> 35:58.400]  Yeah, and there's some some touch bar things that I'd really don't get like and when you're using Safari it like tries to show you
[35:58.400 --> 36:05.560]  Things that represent your tabs in the front most window I changed that I can't I can't understand them
[36:05.560 --> 36:09.080]  I don't I look at them and there's nothing. Yeah, you can't see what they yeah
[36:09.760 --> 36:12.840]  Them in enough detail to for it to make sense. So I changed it to
[36:13.640 --> 36:18.240]  Like I think I've got the forward and back button. Yeah, and like oh, yeah
[36:18.240 --> 36:22.920]  And then they get a thing that shows you all of the open. Yeah tabs on the screen
[36:22.920 --> 36:25.700]  Yeah, I have to admit like one thing I do use I don't have it
[36:25.700 --> 36:32.120]  I don't have you know, I spent six six or seven weeks using a MacBook Pro with the touch bars might as a review unit
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.120]  Oh, July and August I
[36:34.520 --> 36:39.940]  did find myself using the in a lot of dialog boxes the buttons show up in the touch bar like
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.640]  Okay, and cancel or whatever and if you have to type like a password or something and there's a big blue, you know
[36:46.100 --> 36:47.080]  verified button
[36:47.080 --> 36:53.600]  I found myself using that a lot like just because I'm staring at the keyboard to type my password or whatever is I'm typing and
[36:53.600 --> 36:58.280]  Then there's the button and I just poke it. Yeah, so there's things I do that, you know, I do that too
[36:58.760 --> 37:00.840]  So hopefully hopefully they have smart
[37:01.480 --> 37:05.720]  user experience people thinking very hard about the ways that they could
[37:06.360 --> 37:13.160]  Plus it, you know to use Walt Disney's term, but I will say this at the event yesterday and milling about the hands-on area
[37:13.160 --> 37:16.640]  And talking to various friends in you know in the racket
[37:17.120 --> 37:19.120]  There were way more people
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.840]  Who's if the touch bar came up it was are they still and again? I just abandoned the touch bar
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.860]  It was way more of a of a talking point then boy. I wish this machine had the touch bar
[37:30.520 --> 37:35.360]  Sure, that really didn't come up. It really didn't know and the thing that people a lot of people I heard
[37:35.360 --> 37:39.960]  It's not just you know, it's the very obvious thing. A lot of people are like, yeah, this is what I want
[37:39.960 --> 37:43.480]  I just want the touch ID thing in the corner. Yeah, I spent a lot of time
[37:43.800 --> 37:48.440]  You know with the machine connected to a monitor and the lid closed and typing on a clicky keyboard
[37:48.440 --> 37:50.440]  So and I can't
[37:50.680 --> 37:56.080]  Can't fully get used to the touch board because I don't use it. Yeah half the time. Yeah, it's not available. Yep
[37:56.760 --> 38:02.040]  the other thing I thought was very striking in the Mac portion of the event when we can segue and talk about the Mac Mini,
[38:02.040 --> 38:03.160]  but
[38:03.160 --> 38:06.440]  it was very very obvious that there is a
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.760]  uncomfortable
[38:08.760 --> 38:13.080]  the Cold War not Cold War but Apple's relationship with Intel is
[38:13.080 --> 38:19.920]  Strained. Yeah, the word the name Intel was not once mentioned by anybody on stage. Nobody verbally
[38:19.920 --> 38:24.240]  I think I think you're I used to you tell you that someplace. I think you're wrong about yeah, I think
[38:25.440 --> 38:28.280]  The woman I can't remember. I can't I can't remember any other name. Yeah
[38:28.280 --> 38:32.440]  Well, they do a whole group of new people. I don't know who anybody was. I have a minor complaint about that
[38:32.440 --> 38:34.440]  I wish that they would put a
[38:34.520 --> 38:40.840]  The name of the employees on screen and even if it's Angela aren't and we know who it is, you know
[38:40.840 --> 38:46.480]  Who cares, you know? Yeah, because that's one small thing that Tim Cook is doing now that I don't like anymore
[38:46.480 --> 38:48.040]  So if it's somebody new
[38:48.040 --> 38:50.960]  He will announce their full name. Like here's John Ternus
[38:51.640 --> 38:53.200]  and
[38:53.200 --> 38:56.160]  Like the woman he gave her full name. I don't know it either. I
[38:57.040 --> 39:03.320]  Know exactly who you're talking about a tall blonde woman. Yeah, she said I think she said Intel at some point
[39:03.320 --> 39:06.160]  Yeah, well if she did she said at once I was kind of yeah
[39:06.160 --> 39:14.080]  it might have been once and I'm almost certain that then the word Intel only appeared on one slide and it was a
[39:14.720 --> 39:16.720]  very small print it was sort of like the
[39:18.920 --> 39:23.360]  Like the diagram of the inside of the MacBook Air and
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.920]  In pointing out like here's this here's that here's that you know, here's where the chip is. Here's where the graphics thing is
[39:29.920 --> 39:32.080]  Here's where the speakers are and never it's like, you know
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.200]  I said like Intel fifth eighth generation, whatever and pointed to a thing and
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.560]  Then the entire Mac mini thing. They didn't use the word Intel in any of the slides
[39:41.720 --> 39:45.520]  Very telling and they never talked about the chip. They never said anything about what it can do
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.160]  And and compare and contrast that with the iPad Pro later where they were talking about it
[39:51.200 --> 39:58.520]  Yeah, and part of it is I think that they're very clearly unhappy with Intel and the performance of Intel chips over the last few years
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.520]  I
[40:00.720 --> 40:04.840]  Part of it is it's very it's not just rumors to me at this point
[40:04.840 --> 40:10.060]  This event made it very clear to me that Apple is on the cusp of moving the Mac to their own arm chips
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.200]  Yeah, I mean, what does cusp mean? Does it mean 2019? I don't know
[40:16.240 --> 40:18.880]  But at least in their hearts there they've checked out
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.240]  Relationship with Intel it was well and you can see and it was some of it was just pretty obvious and
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.020]  And when they did mention things like that, they would say
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.080]  The new Mac mini is five times faster than the old one which four years ago
[40:35.440 --> 40:40.140]  The last part left unsaid and then you know, they would talk about how much faster the iPad was
[40:40.960 --> 40:45.280]  It's 10,000 times faster than the one that shipped last year, right?
[40:45.280 --> 40:50.620]  But and I think the other problem they had is that they couldn't really brag about how fast then
[40:50.620 --> 40:56.220]  You know the Mac mini or the MacBook Air was at doing X like some real-world task
[40:57.020 --> 41:02.500]  Because if it was a task that could be done on the a new iPad Pro the iPad Pro would embarrass it
[41:02.500 --> 41:08.240]  Like I don't know what you know, I didn't try to sneak into the hands-on area try to sneak
[41:09.100 --> 41:16.780]  Geekbench into the hands-on area thing. Some people do that and I don't know how I honestly I guess cuz you can download
[41:16.780 --> 41:22.260]  Geekbench, I don't know how they get it on iOS devices because I don't know how they get the app store to authorize it
[41:23.460 --> 41:29.620]  But you know people try to do it. I'm I'm quite sure that like Geekbench scores would show the iPad Pro
[41:30.740 --> 41:35.340]  Embarrassing the MacBook Air in terms of performance and you know, alright Geekbench is just an arbitrary
[41:37.340 --> 41:39.340]  Benchmark
[41:39.620 --> 41:42.500]  In real-world performance, so this is an Apple
[41:42.500 --> 41:46.680]  You know, you know, they obviously had a bunch of people from Adobe there
[41:46.820 --> 41:50.980]  One of the hands-on stations yesterday was to show Lightroom
[41:52.420 --> 41:56.940]  Austin Mann was actually there to the photographer. I've linked to him on during fireball a couple times
[41:56.940 --> 42:03.420]  He does these great iPhone camera reviews where he goes like around the world like he'll go to Africa. Yeah, or Patagonia
[42:04.180 --> 42:07.740]  You know, so everybody knows his reviews. They're there. He's a terrific photographer
[42:07.740 --> 42:15.380]  He's an amazing shots and he's also just a great. He's a really friendly person and and and is his enthusiasm for
[42:16.020 --> 42:17.740]  encouraging
[42:17.740 --> 42:21.980]  Everyone to be more creative as a photographer with their device is just it's contagious
[42:22.340 --> 42:27.860]  Anyway, he was there and they were using some of his photos that he had shot with a a hassle bad
[42:27.860 --> 42:34.360]  I don't know what I don't know how much a hassle bad costs, but it costs a lot and it shoots 50 megapixel
[42:34.360 --> 42:40.160]  Images and of course, they're raw. I don't even know if you if a hassle bed doesn't shoot raw
[42:40.600 --> 42:45.040]  so these are raw images from a hassle bed that are 50 megapixels and
[42:45.760 --> 42:53.680]  They're open on the new iPad Pro in Lightroom and you can pinch to zoom and the zoom is every bit as smooth and perfectly
[42:53.680 --> 42:58.600]  Tracking your fingers every step of the way no matter how fast you pinch as though it's like a simple little
[42:58.600 --> 43:05.640]  Photo off your iPad or you know taken with the iPad camera right like and this is a 50 megapixel raw and and you sit
[43:05.640 --> 43:07.320]  There and and they demoed it
[43:07.320 --> 43:10.920]  But you know I got to play with it and you can just say like turn it black and white and it's like this
[43:10.920 --> 43:15.600]  Whole 50 megapixel thing. It's almost as though that the adjustments you make in Lightroom have been
[43:16.360 --> 43:23.080]  Already, you know computed like and you're just switching between images and then they had a 15-inch MacBook
[43:23.080 --> 43:30.080]  Pro next to it also running Lightroom and I the the demo wasn't to make them the MacBook Pro look slow
[43:30.080 --> 43:36.440]  The demo was to show the workflow of how your images in Creative Cloud show up both places at once
[43:36.440 --> 43:39.640]  you know that you can go into the field with an iPad Pro and
[43:40.080 --> 43:43.480]  Connect your camera and start making edits and do all this cool work
[43:43.480 --> 43:46.440]  And then as soon as you sit down at a Mac, you don't have to do anything
[43:46.440 --> 43:47.080]  They're already there
[43:47.080 --> 43:48.400]  You know that was the demo
[43:48.400 --> 43:54.000]  But I opened the same image on the MacBook Pro and use the trackpad to pinch to zoom and it you know
[43:54.000 --> 43:58.160]  It was fast and I used to use Lightroom. I love Lightroom. I just sort of
[43:58.960 --> 44:04.600]  Lazily at my level of photographic enthusiasm switching to Apple photos just made things a little easier
[44:06.640 --> 44:12.000]  The it it it scaled as you pinch to zoom in Lightroom on the trackpad
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.400]  It's scaled better than I remember Lightroom scaling a couple years ago on my Mac at home
[44:17.400 --> 44:23.560]  With far smaller than 50 megabits. It was very smooth, but it wasn't it wasn't like the iPad Pro, right?
[44:23.560 --> 44:26.920]  So there's and that's not because you know
[44:26.920 --> 44:31.640]  That's just the way that the iPad Pro is fast in ways that don't just equate to Geekbench numbers, you know
[44:32.280 --> 44:34.280]  It's this whole integrated
[44:34.840 --> 44:36.360]  You know
[44:36.360 --> 44:40.560]  Everything is under Apple's control, you know, and really it really does stick out
[44:40.560 --> 44:49.160]  And in performance, oh well one of the things that's come out since the event is that the terabyte one
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.680]  Has a has twice the RAM is that you're skipping away? You're skipping ahead skipping the iPad Pro
[44:54.680 --> 44:58.680]  I kind of mentioned it. I mentioned it only in the context of them not talking about Intel
[44:59.680 --> 45:01.680]  Let's do Mac Mini first. We got to do
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.920]  Yeah, I but I got sidetracked by by talking about how clearly Apple is going to move there
[45:08.920 --> 45:13.480]  There's just 100% all the rumors aside doesn't matter what you know
[45:13.680 --> 45:18.240]  Mark Gurman or has had sources to say which I think he's right. I think he's got it exactly, right?
[45:19.560 --> 45:25.560]  But it just you don't need sources. You can just listen to what they're enthusiastic about and why the iPad is as
[45:26.080 --> 45:32.880]  Performant as it is and they need to bring that to the Mac then and they just need to because these companies these systems
[45:33.560 --> 45:37.920]  aren't like it's not like the old days when you can just take a computer and
[45:37.920 --> 45:42.200]  Pick the Intel chip out and put a newer Intel chip in and just sock
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.240]  You know stick it in a socket and now it's a faster computer like these things
[45:45.600 --> 45:51.840]  Even though they are Intel based computers Apple is designing these things as integrated holes the way they do with iOS devices
[45:52.040 --> 45:58.680]  Except they don't have control over these essential aspects of it. And I think it's driving them nuts. Yeah
[46:00.480 --> 46:01.960]  The Mac mini
[46:01.960 --> 46:08.800]  What all what about the colors for the MacBook Air? I think that's pretty it's it's it's like they've they've got the they got rid
[46:08.800 --> 46:11.000]  Of rose gold like right lineup, right?
[46:11.000 --> 46:17.120]  They've they've sort of switch to there's like one true gold now for Apple's aluminum products
[46:17.120 --> 46:20.520]  you know, like the stainless steel gold is sort of a different look but
[46:22.200 --> 46:25.760]  Because I don't think the Apple watch has golden rose gold anymore either no, it doesn't
[46:25.760 --> 46:32.000]  Yeah, it's sort of like it has a gold that has like a touch of pink, but you wouldn't call it rose gold. I
[46:32.920 --> 46:34.920]  Don't know how else to say it
[46:35.120 --> 46:37.640]  I think if you like Apple's other
[46:38.440 --> 46:44.960]  Recent gold products you'll like the gold MacBook Air and if you know if it's not your thing, you know
[46:44.960 --> 46:47.760]  Get the space gray one, right?
[46:48.400 --> 46:53.560]  And yeah, and then like the classic color. Yeah, the classic color whatever you want to call it
[46:53.560 --> 46:57.120]  I guess I guess they call it silver somebody's somebody was speculating that
[46:57.240 --> 47:02.880]  because everybody bought space gray stuff as soon as they could that silver is gonna be the new space gray and people are gonna buy the
[47:03.400 --> 47:06.480]  That the silver is gonna be super popular. I don't know they're both look good
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.400]  Yeah, I think that I think that space gray is a little bit more forgiving in terms of like
[47:12.120 --> 47:14.120]  Dirt and scratches and stuff like that. I
[47:14.520 --> 47:19.740]  Think so, too because the MacBook Pro I had for a couple weeks this summer was was the space gray and you know
[47:19.740 --> 47:24.440]  I had it that's what I got, you know took it to the beach and I mean I don't use it on the beach Beach, but
[47:25.240 --> 47:27.760]  Took it to a beach town and took it in the water. Yeah
[47:29.680 --> 47:31.680]  It really doesn't show the salt water
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.360]  Doesn't show the current computers computers love salt water. Yeah. No, it's good for him
[47:40.720 --> 47:41.680]  You know
[47:41.680 --> 47:43.860]  I'm not surprised but it's you know
[47:43.860 --> 47:49.560]  It it's just another little way that the MacBook Air seemed dated right because it didn't have any color choices
[47:49.560 --> 47:52.440]  All these other computers have these fun color choices and here's them
[47:52.440 --> 47:56.440]  Here's their most popular one and you've you can have any color you want as long as it's silver
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.240]  Well, now you can have any color of Mac mini you want as long as it's space gray, yeah, that's cool though
[48:03.240 --> 48:06.440]  It looks it looks really cool. It's a cool little thing
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.600]  People were kind of some people were wondering about the size like if the size was gonna go any smaller
[48:12.680 --> 48:18.440]  But it's the same still the same size right basically hold that thought and let's thank our next sponsor. It's our good friend
[48:18.440 --> 48:23.960]  So this is the opposite. This is not a first-time sponsor. It's a repeat sponsor, but it's our good friends at fracture
[48:26.280 --> 48:27.840]  Fracture
[48:27.840 --> 48:32.640]  Takes your images you send them to fracture you print them out and they don't print them on paper
[48:32.640 --> 48:35.240]  They print them directly on glass. They take a piece of glass
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.380]  They take your image and then they print it right on the glass and it looks fantastic
[48:41.680 --> 48:44.440]  I've bought a bunch of these they make fantastic
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.600]  gifts, and I believe that that's why their sponsorship is turning up again because here we are the
[48:50.000 --> 48:54.840]  Recording on 31st. Most of you will be listening to this probably in early November
[48:55.580 --> 49:03.360]  Holidays are coming up and fracture because they make these things by hand down in there. They call it the factory down in Florida
[49:04.440 --> 49:10.520]  They get backed up in December. I don't know when I don't know what point year after year, you know
[49:10.520 --> 49:15.480]  But it you this is not something you can order in December 20th and get by the 25th
[49:16.480 --> 49:20.080]  And you know, I'm a procrastinator. I'll tell you the truth
[49:20.080 --> 49:24.080]  I haven't bought any fractures for people for the holidays yet, and that's why I'm on this show
[49:29.160 --> 49:34.680]  But I will I guarantee you I will buy some of these for the holidays and I am going to order them in November and
[49:34.680 --> 49:36.040]  Then it is a relief
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.720]  I'll tell you what some of you people are saying people and you do a lot of your holiday shopping in
[49:40.840 --> 49:45.720]  November because that's just what the same people do others of you are like me and you're a procrastinator and
[49:46.240 --> 49:48.440]  If you ever do buy something in
[49:49.240 --> 49:52.100]  November for somebody my god, what a great feeling it is
[49:52.100 --> 49:53.760]  It's like the weight of the world is off your shoulders
[49:53.760 --> 49:56.080]  Like I don't know. I don't have to worry about what to get the grandparents
[49:56.080 --> 49:59.600]  I've bought him a bunch of fractures of the kids or the dog or yeah, you know
[49:59.600 --> 50:04.440]  Whoever you want to get the picture of that's what I'll do is I'll buy one thing in like November and think oh my god
[50:04.440 --> 50:06.760]  I'm so ahead of the curve and then be buying everything. Yeah
[50:08.160 --> 50:11.560]  Get your fractures early. These are fantastic gifts
[50:11.560 --> 50:17.520]  They are the good did my number one recommendation every year for a thing that you can get as a gift for friends and family
[50:18.120 --> 50:24.560]  Everybody loves pictures. It is fantastic to get some of your pictures printed out and off your digital devices
[50:24.600 --> 50:28.920]  Yeah, 99% of my photos or live on my devices and I look at them on
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.880]  screens
[50:30.880 --> 50:36.120]  Get to get the ones that are your favorites the ones you've put the little hard on in photos get those printed out
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.520]  Give them to your loved ones. It's a fantastic gift. They've got a whole bunch of sizes
[50:40.480 --> 50:46.760]  Every size from small to large everything come they come with everything you need to set them up if it's like a small one
[50:46.760 --> 50:48.240]  You want to put it on your desk or your mantle?
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.320]  If it's a bigger one that you want to hang it comes with everything because they're printed directly on glass
[50:53.320 --> 50:54.120]  They don't need frames
[50:54.120 --> 50:58.880]  The picture is the the frame and so it's just a total corner-to-corner
[50:58.880 --> 51:05.000]  Image and it looks amazing and I guarantee you that's the other thing is people come in and if people don't know fractured
[51:05.000 --> 51:09.000]  They'll say what the hell has this picture hanging up without a frame and then you'll get to tell them about fractured
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.840]  Just like I'm telling you
[51:10.840 --> 51:12.920]  They have a green factory carbon neutral
[51:13.400 --> 51:18.640]  You can feel good about that go to fracture me. Their website is fracture me calm
[51:19.520 --> 51:24.880]  talk ta LK and you'll get a special discount on your first fracture order and
[51:24.880 --> 51:31.780]  And don't forget to pick the talk show in their one question survey after checkout. That's fracture me
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Calm slash talk
[51:34.120 --> 51:39.840]  I'll just spoil it that the question they ask is how did you hear about fracture? Yeah, I don't know if you can guess that
[51:40.600 --> 51:45.600]  But anyway, they're a great company fantastic gift. Go go get them now and and you'll thank me later
[51:45.600 --> 51:53.320]  MacBook not MacBook Mac mini is exact same size and more or less the story. I was told and I would not
[51:54.240 --> 51:59.760]  It's really great. They were they were like look, you know, we haven't updated it in a while. We know we're not proud of it
[52:00.480 --> 52:03.280]  It is what it is, you know, and there's various reasons for it
[52:04.080 --> 52:06.080]  But but they really wanted to do
[52:06.960 --> 52:09.960]  was have a meaningful update and
[52:10.360 --> 52:12.360]  You know they
[52:12.360 --> 52:19.200]  they again without throwing Intel under the bus more or less they they didn't mention Intel what they meant what they said was if you've
[52:19.200 --> 52:21.640]  Watch been watching Moore's law in recent years
[52:21.640 --> 52:26.700]  There really isn't a lot of gain to be had with what we used to call speed bump updates
[52:27.560 --> 52:29.560]  I think it might have
[52:29.920 --> 52:34.680]  So basically, I think it's sort of like I don't think the Mac mini would have been that much better of a computer if they'd
[52:34.680 --> 52:40.680]  Done minor speed bumps in the last few years. I think it just would have made people who want the product to be alive feel better
[52:40.680 --> 52:42.600]  Right, you know
[52:42.600 --> 52:47.680]  Because it's proof that you know that Apple hasn't forgotten that the product is there
[52:47.680 --> 52:52.280]  Like I think at this point in the Mac mini had gone so long between updates. I think it was like four years
[52:52.280 --> 52:56.880]  I think people were afraid that it's like let's say you're in the Apple Store and
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.560]  Tim Cook comes in and it's like oh my god. Tim Cook is in the Apple Store and he comes up and he's like
[53:02.560 --> 53:05.480]  Hey, how are you? I'm Tim and you're like, hey and you get to ask a question
[53:05.480 --> 53:09.880]  I think people were afraid to ask about the Mac mini because he'd be like we still saw Mac mini what?
[53:09.880 --> 53:13.640]  And he'd be like turn around to his shoulder and be like cancel that there's one
[53:14.640 --> 53:20.120]  I think people were afraid afraid to even mention it like he'd come in the Apple Store people would cover up the Mac mini like
[53:20.120 --> 53:26.600]  I'm afraid Tim's gonna find out we're still selling this and and kill it but it ends up they made a truly meaningful update
[53:28.080 --> 53:33.800]  It is completely new everything is new about it except as you said the form factor and that's based on their
[53:34.960 --> 53:36.960]  extensive extensive
[53:36.960 --> 53:44.120]  Conversations with their biggest Mac mini customers and that the things they heard is we want higher performance. We want more RAM
[53:44.640 --> 53:50.780]  We want we want you to go all SSD, you know, if that if we can get performance gains out of that
[53:51.600 --> 53:53.600]  And we can get like a t2
[53:54.840 --> 53:59.060]  You know, yeah, the t2 is interesting because it shows that's the the little
[53:59.060 --> 54:06.760]  Apple system, you know arm system on a chip that is used for like this secure enclave and stuff on the MacBook Pros and then
[54:06.760 --> 54:09.740]  Now with the MacBook Air that have the the fingerprint sensor
[54:10.820 --> 54:15.080]  The Mac mini obviously doesn't have touch ID or face ID because it you know
[54:15.080 --> 54:17.040]  There's nowhere to touch and it doesn't have cameras
[54:17.040 --> 54:21.840]  but it uses the t2 for all these other things that the t2 does like the it's the
[54:22.440 --> 54:24.240]  It's the storage controller
[54:24.240 --> 54:30.640]  So all this, you know to get even faster SSD throughput it all goes through this instead of going through the CPU
[54:31.320 --> 54:37.840]  All sorts of other things that that the t2 can handle to make everything faster. I think that's where the video encoding comes from
[54:38.440 --> 54:45.200]  Like they see I think they said it was 900 times faster. Was it nine thousand times faster? I don't know
[54:45.200 --> 54:47.760]  I think it's a big number H HEVC
[54:47.760 --> 54:55.760]  Video can encoding is 900 times faster because they're not giving it to the Intel CPU to do not because the Intel's so slow
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.920]  but that it video encoding through a CPU is
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.560]  so much less efficient than when you dedicate a little part of a hardware chip that you know
[55:04.560 --> 55:09.500]  There's a little part of the t2 that the only thing it does is encode a GVC video and it's like oh I can do
[55:09.500 --> 55:11.500]  That 900 times faster. Well now you get that
[55:12.040 --> 55:14.540]  and the other thing they heard from customers though is
[55:14.540 --> 55:20.100]  Here's the only thing is that we've you know, we have 10,000 of these things and we look here's where they are
[55:20.100 --> 55:22.320]  See how and you see how these do we have these slots?
[55:23.060 --> 55:25.060]  like
[55:25.580 --> 55:28.860]  If you do change the fit in the same slots if you do yeah
[55:28.860 --> 55:32.340]  If you do change the size we we can we can deal with it
[55:32.340 --> 55:35.140]  but if you can keep the size the same that would be really awesome because
[55:36.700 --> 55:41.260]  Yeah, and they made a point they made a point of showing those kinds of installations absolutely
[55:41.260 --> 55:44.820]  So they called out longtime sponsor of the show max stadium
[55:45.380 --> 55:49.180]  Or no, I don't know if they've ever sponsored the podcast, but they've sponsored during fireball many times
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.860]  So I'll mention that in the interest of full disclosure
[55:52.980 --> 55:56.020]  Brian Stuckey is his head's
[55:56.980 --> 56:03.660]  He used to be he used to run a business called Mac mini colo with a co-location and max stadium
[56:04.300 --> 56:06.940]  I think was in I think it was a merger
[56:06.940 --> 56:14.020]  But anyway, what used to be Mac mini colo is now max stadium and Brian Stuckey has been sponsoring during fireball for at least over
[56:14.020 --> 56:20.280]  10 years with from the Mac mini colo days till now maybe more like 15 years one of the earliest sponsors
[56:20.980 --> 56:25.320]  And I know you know, I don't think I've ever met him actually, but I've known him through email for years. Good guy
[56:25.980 --> 56:27.980]  He was actually at the event. I didn't see him
[56:28.220 --> 56:34.620]  Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to bump into everybody when there's 2,000 people but I know he was he was there which is cool for him
[56:34.780 --> 56:35.900]  I
[56:35.900 --> 56:37.660]  think I
[56:37.660 --> 56:42.020]  think he had to keep his mouth shut about going because I think I think if
[56:42.620 --> 56:46.340]  He'd been like, you know tweeting like I'm going to the Apple event. I think everybody
[56:47.480 --> 56:49.480]  Why is he going to the Apple? Yeah
[56:49.660 --> 56:51.580]  Yeah
[56:51.580 --> 56:57.020]  But they showed max stadium and and it was you know, and they mentioned them on stage, which was really cool
[56:57.020 --> 56:59.500]  It's cool, you know to me for somebody who I've known for a long time
[56:59.500 --> 57:01.900]  I sort of ran this business as a little you know
[57:01.900 --> 57:06.860]  you know started small and made it big but I was told that they there's a
[57:08.580 --> 57:10.580]  All sorts of big companies that have
[57:11.860 --> 57:15.980]  Similar setups, I don't know if they have quite as many Mac minis as max stadium
[57:15.980 --> 57:20.620]  But you know thousands literally there's a bunch of big companies with thousands of Mac minis doing
[57:21.620 --> 57:27.540]  Whatever and it's you know, they can't mention them, you know, they didn't even say who they were off the radar
[57:27.540 --> 57:28.940]  Just like it just wasn't worth it
[57:28.940 --> 57:34.100]  You know legally and getting clearance and you know, a lot of these companies are so big that it's just you know
[57:34.460 --> 57:36.460]  There's a bit of bureaucracy
[57:36.940 --> 57:43.260]  But they have it, you know, this is more popular than you and think was was the gist of it. Yeah
[57:44.860 --> 57:49.740]  Video encoding a lot of you know, I don't know if they have thousands but a lot of a lot of companies
[57:49.740 --> 57:53.100]  You know movie companies and stuff. I don't know just just a lot of people with that infrastructure
[57:53.100 --> 57:57.880]  So keeping the form factor the same size was a big deal and you and I talked about this last week about
[57:57.880 --> 58:02.640]  The mini isn't all that many anymore. So why can't they just make it smaller? And that's it
[58:03.080 --> 58:05.760]  Because that's what many customers many customers don't want that
[58:08.720 --> 58:14.720]  Basically for however many consumers there are who would want that and wish it was more like an Apple TV size
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.280]  This is still kind of small and you can fit it, you know
[58:19.280 --> 58:23.880]  It certainly isn't going to take up a lot of space in your home entertainment center if that's where you're putting it, etc
[58:23.880 --> 58:28.560]  And then there's a lot of other customers who are buying thousands of these things who really don't want this size to change
[58:28.560 --> 58:32.920]  I have a retro I have a retro pie and I'll tell you like anytime you have to plug anything into that
[58:32.920 --> 58:34.440]  It's actually it's actually too small
[58:34.440 --> 58:39.680]  it's kind of a pain in the ass because it will the cord like if you're using a controller or something with it as a
[58:40.040 --> 58:42.120]  USB cord, it'll just pull the thing
[58:42.720 --> 58:47.720]  When you're doing any kind of movement, it'll pull it right off the table. Yeah, and and I would imagine
[58:47.720 --> 58:51.200]  I mean you're not doing the same thing with one of those Intel nooks, but yeah
[58:51.200 --> 58:56.360]  It to me it doesn't need to be that much smaller. Yeah, so what's the retro pie?
[58:56.360 --> 59:02.640]  Is that like a Raspberry Pi type thing? Yeah, it's a Raspberry Pi thing that you configure to run old
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.680]  You know old games. Oh, that's cool Atari and other things like that
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.520]  Well, why don't I have one of those that I'm that I am, you know, 100% license to use
[59:17.760 --> 59:19.760]  It's all on the oven up
[59:19.760 --> 59:20.880]  I
[59:20.880 --> 59:22.880]  Pay for these at some point. I'm sure
[59:23.800 --> 59:25.360]  What else what?
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.520]  What else about the Mac Mini? I mean, there's not that much to say about it is all new
[59:28.520 --> 59:33.760]  Well, it's 300 bucks more. It starts out 300. Yeah, and and so that well, I will I will just say right here
[59:33.760 --> 59:35.360]  I hats off to
[59:35.360 --> 59:38.280]  Mark Gurman who didn't have a lot of details on it
[59:38.280 --> 59:44.720]  but did did say all along that it was going to be geared toward toward a more professional user base and
[59:44.720 --> 59:50.400]  And it's undeniable that that's true. You know, you listen to what they're saying about this and you know
[59:50.400 --> 59:55.360]  And the price increase reflects that you know, yeah it is, you know, it's still the cheapest Mac you can buy
[59:55.360 --> 59:58.800]  Yeah, it's and you know, it's the old Mac Mini
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:03.200]  Especially I think the one that the previous generation in addition to being old
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:09.700]  was also I think the least popular one ever because they did things like solder the RAM onto the motherboard and right it was
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:16.440]  That's another difference right is the RAM can be upgraded. Yep. The ham is the RAM is just you know in a socket it
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.300]  The catch is that it's not user accessible
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:25.480]  meaning it's not like a simple thing where you unscrew a little hatch and there's the RAM and you pop it out and put it in
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.380]  it's
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.480]  officially needs to go to a authorized service provider because it's
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.440]  Complicated to get to so I think anybody who is an enthusiast though
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:41.540]  Could do it with like an iFixit guide or something like that. If you're of that bent. Yeah
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.000]  You know it whereas when it's soldered on the motherboard there's nothing
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.320]  Not so the hard the hard drive is not upgradeable, right? I don't think so. No. Yeah
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.160]  I think the hard drive is soldered in yeah
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:01.460]  And I think that's part of that whole secure chain from the t2 to the storage controller and right through to the hard drive
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.300]  So there's a reason for that, you know that
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:11.720]  People may not like the reason but it's you know, by by the storage you want when you configure it. Yeah, but anyway, that's good news
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:20.300]  Yeah, but effectively the last the old generation Mac Mini was made up of laptop laptop components and the new one is made up of desktop
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.520]  components
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.400]  From the CPU to the RAM to the storage. Yeah, I think that's great and it has tons of ports on the back
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:32.620]  That's another reason to keep the bigger size because they really is sort of ports from one side to another
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:36.980]  You know, lots of USB C a couple of the old USBs
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.900]  It's got all sorts of ports. Yeah. Yeah
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.540]  The big ones the little ones
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.020]  One of the things I would say about the price difference though is they have the you know
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:52.860]  They did have a $500 one previously, but the $500 one was a piece of shit. Yeah
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:02:00.620]  Yeah, it was it was a lousy very low-end like I think it had a spinning hard drive a 1.4 gigahertz
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.820]  CPU and four gigs of RAM. Yeah, I mean you're getting way more now
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.900]  I mean, yeah, you're paying more but you're getting way more for your money
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:15.980]  The one thing that was a little sad in the hands-on area to me at least as a long-time fan of Apple's branded
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:22.180]  Standalone displays over the years was that all of the minis were hooked up to like the LG 4k display
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.460]  And that is it's not ugly. Mm-hmm. It's not attractive, you know, it's
[01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.300]  It was weird. It's weird to see all these, you know
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:35.780]  See an Apple event and have all of the displays be these very generic LG black displays
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.940]  We haven't heard anything about that. Well, wait some time
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:43.820]  Well, I think it's waiting for the Mac Pro and it might be so expensive that it wouldn't make sense to use with a Mac
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:48.460]  Mini for most people and I don't know. I don't know what the story is, but they're they're working on a pro display
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.220]  But obviously isn't coming out yet
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.260]  So they had nothing to show but it is it is a little weird that they've got a you know
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.860]  A machine that needs a display and they don't sell a display anymore
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.700]  Like that would have seemed crazy 15 years ago, right?
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.620]  Yeah, why wouldn't Apple sell a display? Yeah, well crazy. I
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.260]  Don't have much else to say about the Mac Mini though. You know, I mean, I'm not I don't I don't have one in my life
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.300]  I don't need one. I'm glad though for the people who do I'm very happy with the Apple display
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.820]  I don't have one in my life. I don't need one. I'm glad though for the people who do I'm very happy for all of you
[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:27.420]  Who are Mac Mini fans? I hope I think everybody's happy. It seems like people are happy. Yeah, I'm interested
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:32.620]  You know, I'm gonna wait a while and possibly pick one up as a reefer, but I want you know
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:38.580]  I need a new complex. Yeah server in my house and I think the base one would probably do fine. Yeah
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:43.660]  I guess it kind of makes sense now to why they're selling the standalone
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:49.660]  Space-grade keyboard and mouse because you know, if you buy a Mac Mini, it doesn't come with any keyboard or mouse
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.580]  It's like bring your own but now, you know, it's a space-grade device. You can buy the space-grade
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.500]  iMac Pro
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.100]  Keyboard and mouse, you know to go with it. It's nice
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.360]  And then that leaves us with the the iPad Pro, right
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:12.260]  The one thing I ordered you did order one. I did order which one did you get? I got the cheapest one I could get
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:17.080]  It was again talking about the price. I mean I saw I got the 64 gigabyte
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.500]  I have a 64 gigabyte air to now and I'm not I'm still not using all the space on it
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500]  so and I have a bunch of games on there that are like
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.060]  You know larger than a gigabyte that I'd never play and I thought okay
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.740]  I can I mean mostly what I do is, you know
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.340]  I'll either be typing in text files or I'll be streaming video
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:39.820]  So I don't actually need that much storage on it. So I thought okay, I think I can I can live with it and
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:44.820]  And so I got that I got the cheapest. I got the 11 inch
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.220]  iPad Pro 64 gigabytes and I just got the
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:51.860]  folio cover
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.020]  And then with taxes, you know, it's practically a thousand dollars
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:02.580]  It's a lot. Yeah, and you know, we were talking about this before I mean and I I don't want to bury it
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.600]  So we might as well lead with it
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.300]  I mean the starting price for these new iPad pros is significantly higher than the previous starting point
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:13.900]  I think the the old ten point five iPad Pro started at six hundred fifty dollars
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:19.620]  I'll round up a dollar, you know, I get confused by 640 share 650 now. It's 800 bucks
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:25.100]  So that's that's a big increase and then the twelve point nine inch one. I
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.940]  forget
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.260]  Was it 999? I don't know but it's I don't remember what it was now
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:37.860]  But it's it went up quite a bit here. Oh, here it is. It went from oh, I guess you could get it for 799
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:42.780]  Oh, I didn't know that you so you could get a twelve point nine inch for $7.99 and now it starts at $9.99
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.180]  Okay
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:50.700]  And they are selling older ones still I guess didn't at their lower price points. I
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:58.100]  Don't know what to make of this. I know people are disappointed in it. And and there's people on Twitter chirping at me that you know
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.560]  that
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.400]  You know and I guess with the watch they did
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:07.580]  It was a similar thing where the entry-level series for a watch is more expensive than last year's entry-level series three watches
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.580]  but
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.180]  I kind of feel like they're adding, you know Apple. I don't feel like they're just
[01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:21.820]  increasing prices, I don't you know just for the sake of increasing prices and that they could be selling these things at
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:26.460]  The prices from last year and still give you all of these improvements
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:31.060]  I think that they're like improving these products in significant ways that make them more expensive like
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.820]  It's I just tell you looking at having looked at the new iPads in person. They are
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:41.780]  Really really impressive displays and I think that these displays I think it's more expensive to do this
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:45.740]  It is they're not just cutting the corners in a round circle there
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:51.700]  there's a lot of complicated stuff like neil I patella and the verge had a great article about the iPhone 10 are and
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:59.640]  The display masking and and what they're doing to make the round corners look nice and not you don't see any jagged pixel edges
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.460]  and stuff
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:06.760]  And I think it's expensive to get them to reduce those bezels, you know, they're not just cutting the bezels off
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:11.900]  Like that those bezels covered important things that backlit the display
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.620]  It's it's not it's not like with the with the Mac Mini where the thing hasn't been updated in four years, right?
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.540]  The iPad has been updated continually and if you want a new, you know
[01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:27.580]  you can I mean, I forget when when they did that update that made the
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:33.220]  9.7 inch 10.5 inches. It was like a year and a half ago. Yeah, something like that
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.700]  I mean, but Reese, you know, not that long ago and it's still a good
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.660]  device and it's better than it was a few years ago and that thing is
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:47.540]  Considerably cheaper and then they still sell and you know relatively new base iPad. Yeah, like 350
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:51.540]  Yeah, so the you know, the the iPad lineup covers all sorts of price points
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.620]  it's just if if your mental model is I want the
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:01.300]  Best iPad at you know in the 60, you know the lowest storage configuration
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:05.340]  I want the entry-level best iPad the price is now higher than it used to be
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:11.020]  But I just feel like just like with the iPhone 10 10 and now the 10s
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.020]  It's not so much about raising the price of the new best
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:22.220]  Model, it's making the new best model a higher tier, you know a more premium product
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:29.260]  And I will say having touched these things yesterday these they feel so great in hand. They I love the squared off side
[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:34.700]  Yeah, I love well, we talked about that. Yeah, we talked about it in the context of DC. Yeah
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.300]  Yeah, I'm super excited
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:41.740]  If you anybody who likes the SE, you know flat sides is gonna love these iPads
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.740]  I think it's even better on the iPads and
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:49.620]  There were rumors that they would be flat and I guess that a lot of that came out of the case making industry
[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:55.180]  But there are also rumors that they would diamond cut the chamfers as they called them, you know
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:57.180]  like the SE but they didn't there's their
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.860]  The sides are flat, but they're sort of rounded when it goes from like the back to the side
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:09.540]  It's not a 45 degree angle or harsh cut and I actually think it's better. I think it is
[01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:15.140]  Just in terms of the way like the back turns to the side turns to the display
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.740]  It's the best iOS device bar. None Apple's ever made of any phone any iPad
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.980]  It is this is the way I kind of want the phones to be like this
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.900]  It is really yeah, I mean I would I would like that more it is
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:33.140]  It and the amount where it's where it is rounded is just so comfortable
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:36.300]  It really is so super comfortable to hold in one hand
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.020]  And and the way that they made
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.340]  the
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:49.060]  Kept the footprint of the the the old ten point five kept the footprint of the device the same and just made the screen bigger
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.140]  to go edge to edge
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.820]  Because and it makes a lot of sense
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:58.580]  It's exactly as they just that way the cover would still be a full-size keyboard if they shrank the device
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.120]  Then you'd have like a little mini keyboard that would not be good
[01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:07.540]  So that they don't you don't want the footprint smaller because you want to have a full-size keyboard and then with the bigger one
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:14.220]  They did shrink the device because it was big and heavy and it's it's actually a little confusing in the hand
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:18.660]  It was confusing to me in the hands-on area because I'd be you know, they'd be you know, they're very much
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.860]  Yeah, it would be I would aid hand it to me
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:24.860]  But here you can play with it and here's the new pencil and you play with it and I'm like wait
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.340]  Which one am I holding and they're like, oh, that's the big one and I'm like, oh
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:33.040]  Because you never got confused with the other iPad pros like yeah, you you know
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:38.160]  Did you weren't confused for even a nanosecond whether you had the big one or the smaller one now?
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.960]  It's it is a little confusing. I mean if you see them side-by-side, it's very clear
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:48.360]  They're not that close inside size, but the big one is so much more single hand holdable that it it makes a difference
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.600]  And I will say this the Apple pencil I
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.560]  Love is this is one of the best 2.0 Apple products I can imagine
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:03.280]  I think the original Apple pencil was a great product and I think people who have it love it
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.600]  But every single thing they changed about it is better
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.680]  So it has a man in in base in print and they really hit the large complaints about it. Anyway, yep
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.920]  well
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920]  It let me just run them down
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:25.160]  so it has a matte finish instead of a glossy finish and I like that it just feels way better and if
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:29.840]  At least every pen I own that I like has a you know
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.680]  Somewhat grippy or finished than an Apple glossy Apple pencil. Mm-hmm
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.160]  I think it's as a it sounds like the smallest thing, but I think it just feels so much better
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.000]  It has a flat side and I know the old Apple pencil was weighted
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.120]  so that it shouldn't roll off tables, but
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:54.400]  I'll tell you if you want to keep a pencil from rolling off a table giving it a flat side is is the way to go
[01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.920]  It no longer has a cap, you know
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  Like the rumor came out that the iPad was going to USB C and so a lot of people like well
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.800]  They're gonna have to switch the new pencil to USB C
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.240]  That you know, it was a good guess but I think getting rid of anything that you stick into the iPad is way better
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.240]  Pairing and charging magnetically, you know through inductive charging is so much nicer
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.880]  the fact that the flat side lets it stay stuck to the iPad is
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.960]  You know it a lot of people, you know for the last couple of years have been like well
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.440]  Where am I supposed to put the pencil?
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.260]  Right. It's a good question. And now there's a great place to put it and it's very natural
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.400]  The magnets are fantastic
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.200]  I know at the date I think they even mentioned that there's like a hundred and forty magnets in the iPad
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:50.680]  The the case connects better it the pencil connects great. You can see it. They're very strong magnets
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.920]  You they've the pencil feels very secure
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  And there's no cap
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.120]  So you don't need you know, you don't need a cap so you don't have a cap to lose
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.120]  You don't have a little weird lightning coupler to lose
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:10.240]  It's just one piece and it's it's just really nice. I yeah, it's a great up
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:13.280]  It works. I think it works exactly the way you want. You would want to work
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.880]  I like it. It's great that the iPads now have tap to wake and now they've you know
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.280]  They've added this feature where if you use the pencil to wake it it automatically jumps you to notes
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.000]  Did you see this? No, I did not see that
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.240]  Yeah, so I think they mentioned it in the event, but they didn't really say it jumps you right to the system notes app
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:40.640]  And you it's a setting you can have it set to open your most recent note or always go to a new note
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.400]  So if you use the pencil to wake the screen you can instantly go to you know
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.120]  whichever you prefer most recent note or always a new note and
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.760]  it's a lot like
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.160]  When you take a photo without having unlocked the phone all you get is access to that photo
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:02.160]  Okay, so like if you do tap to wake the iPad the only note you can see is that one note
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:08.200]  You can't just you know all without authenticating with face ID. You can't go look at your other notes. Mm-hmm
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.560]  Face ID works great in in the hands-on area, you know that the Apple employees had it trained to their faces
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.160]  so I didn't get to try it with my face, but you know, I
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.240]  Have physical I observed with my own eyes it working
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.280]  upside down left left right all four orientations
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:36.240]  Uh, that seems like a huge thing. There's a very cool animation that you get if your thumb is holding the
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:41.440]  The covering the the the sensor array. Mm-hmm. It will say
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.240]  Your hand is I forget what it says like move your hand
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.400]  Move your hand dummy
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.960]  And then it has an arrow pointing to which you know where it's being covered
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.680]  Because you don't have to know you're not really supposed to know where that you can use it in any orientation, right?
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:01.640]  And so if it's on if your thumb is covering it on the right
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.700]  It'll be an arrow pointing over there. And if it's covering on the left the arrow will be over there
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.220]  And because I don't have a 10 or 10 anything higher than that
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.340]  That's new right? You can't use the the 10. No
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.640]  yeah, like that because the 10 still has a still has an up and a down yeah, and it's
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.080]  Which is hard to tell sometimes
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:23.800]  Yeah
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.200]  And they even said that this the the fact that it works in multiple orientations is done in software
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:34.040]  And that the reason it doesn't do it in software on the iPhone is that people don't hold the iPhone upside down. So I
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560]  mean
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:39.320]  Good enough. I have to say I don't I don't you know, I
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.220]  I guess it would be nicer if it woke up in landscape, you know, like you
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.600]  But I can't say that that's an annoyance
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.720]  But with the iPad it definitely, you know, it seems like something they had to get right and they did. Yeah
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:00.880]  Trying to think what else about the iPad do you have any questions about the iPad I
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.520]  Don't think so, I'm just I'm very excited about it
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.880]  So the invite my ear too is basically fine for what I'm using it for
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.520]  Yeah, because I'm really not taxing it very much, but I saw this and was just like
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120]  Well, it's been four years. I'm gonna get it
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.400]  Oh the pencil has engraving now you can get if you order it online
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:25.760]  You can get your pencil engraved with your name and I I wonder how much of that is just it has a flat side
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.500]  so why not and how much of it is like
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.960]  People are like 20. Yeah, you're working in an office. There are 20 pencils and like is that my pencil? No, no
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.680]  Let me see what it says
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]  You cannot see it
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.120]  Oh the pencil and the pencil has that double tap feature
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:50.240]  And I've been changes. Yeah tools, right?
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:56.200]  Well it by default it changes tools like it'll change from the pencil to the eraser tool and then into system-wide setting
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.200]  That you can have it do something else
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.680]  Like you can have it bring up the color picker and then individual apps can have it do other things
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.560]  Like I forget what Photoshop had it doing but they had it doing something more Photoshop specific
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.440]  But it's pretty cool
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.620]  demo that AR demo that they did with it was actually I think
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.200]  One of the I mean, I don't have an application for that obviously, but I think that one looked really cool and
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.880]  Is was way better than those game demos that they always do yeah, yeah, I saw in the hands-on area
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.640]  I saw a Lego demo again, and it's cool looking and
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.880]  In the new the latest chips definitely get the stuff on the tabletop better
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:46.800]  You know that doesn't quite seem like it's almost on the table. It really does look like little Lego minifigs running around the table
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.920]  But I just don't I I don't see the P
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:57.400]  I see the appeal of a video game and I see the appeal of building Lego kits and I don't see the appeal of
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.640]  Holding a thing in front of a Lego kit and playing a video game. I don't I don't see it
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.480]  I don't well, I mean and like I said, I don't have an apple. I mean, I'm not gonna do a
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:10.160]  Multi-layer Photoshop
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.520]  that I want to suddenly start animating but
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.280]  But some people are probably gonna need to do that
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.280]  So the other big question I know that everybody has and I don't know what the answer is an apple isn't gonna to say is
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.720]  The big thing everybody. Well, let me you know what before we wrap up
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.600]  I know we got it. We got to go soon. This is a sort of a hit quickie show
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:32.840]  I bet I got it. I got to do one more sponsor. Thank you. And then I'm gonna mention USB C
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.880]  Is it coming to yeah to certain other product?
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.840]  That people are wondering about
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.740]  But before I do let me tell you about our third sponsor and it is a fantastic company line ode
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.560]  line ode is a web hosting company and
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:55.520]  You can get you can deploy and manage an SSD server in their cloud meaning the storage
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:00.120]  It's not like a spinning hard disk. You're getting SSD performance and you can get one running in seconds
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.480]  You can sign up in seconds and get your choice of Linux distribution your resources
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:12.180]  And your node location they have ten data centers worldwide their plan start
[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:17.960]  You can get a gigabyte of RAM for just five bucks a month five bucks a month. And this is a fantastic company
[01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.320]  It's a great price, but this isn't like a discount web host
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.840]  I'm just tell you right now. This has nothing to do with the sponsorship
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  It is a complete coincidence
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:32.200]  But I am I am actually moving during fireball to a new server and it is going to be line ode and I started the process
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.000]  of that
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.960]  It's not taking me a long time to do it. It's taking me a long time to
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:44.400]  It's it's procrastination not any kind of technical hurdle that I know Marco Arment hosts a lot of stuff at line ode
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:50.520]  It is a great it is where people go who know what the hell they're you know, choosing from it is a fantastic company
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.840]  I'm about to trust them with my my livelihood
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.600]  and but it's a great price to start it is absolutely a
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.560]  Great great place to start five bucks a month gets you an entire gigabyte of RAM. It's a great server
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.600]  They're gonna offer you I'm spoiling this right now. They're gonna offer you as a listener of this show at $20 credit
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:18.560]  And that means you could get four months free. You could just use this for four months with the $20 credit
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.480]  I'm about to tell you about and have a real online
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.400]  web hosting account
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  They have a seven-day money-back guarantee
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.880]  You can really you can go there sign up and get a server running in under a minute
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.320]  They have hourly billing with a monthly cap on all plans. You never get a surprise
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.720]  Oh my god, your bill is high because traffic was up. You'll find out about everything like that as you go
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.200]  24-7 friendly support and
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:54.520]  This stuff the VMS the virtual machines you run you give you full control all the control you could possibly want
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.940]  running docker containers
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.320]  encrypted disks
[01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.840]  VPNs anything you want for security native SSD storage. I told you that
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.240]  40 gigabit network
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.640]  Intel e5 processors
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:14.280]  Is it just goes on and on and on with all these things that I don't even know exactly what they even mean
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.000]  But if if you're an expert and server hosting, you know what it means. It's a great thing
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:25.660]  They have block storage available in their data centers in Newark Fremont Dallas, Atlanta
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.720]  Frankfurt
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:32.720]  London Singapore and soon not yet, but soon Tokyo
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.940]  so, you know when they say worldwide that that that's pretty worldwide and
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:44.860]  They're now taking comments on their beta manager. That's at cloud line. Oh calm. It's open source
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:52.620]  It's a single page app built using a cutting-edge react JS stack and like I said, it's open source
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:56.020]  So not only are they taking feedback on the interface and what it does
[01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:03.360]  But you can actually get the code and see how it works and it's backed entirely by line ode public beta API and they have
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.700]  a URL for that at github.com slash line ode manager slash manager
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.100]  Anyway, this is great. They have so much stuff. It's a great service
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:18.740]  I really recommend it and they're hiring go to lino comm slash careers and find out if maybe you want to go work for them
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.740]  It's a great company and they're really doing well
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:27.420]  So here's the deal go to lino comm l in ode comm slash the talk show
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:35.960]  Use that come promo code this promo code go to that URL. No. No, you came here. The promo code is talk show 2018
[01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.900]  Talk show 2018 and that's what gets you the $20 credit
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.540]  But you can literally use for up to four months of service, which is a crazy crazy deal
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:50.820]  line ode comm slash the talk show promo code talk show 2018
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.980]  So lightning port
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:23:00.660]  Yeah, a lot of people see this as the death now that well, isn't this a sign that next year?
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.080]  They're just gonna go USB C on all the devices
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:09.900]  And if the iPhone had USB C, then you'd only need USB C chargers, right? You could have a new
[01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.980]  Recent vintage MacBook or MacBook Pro or MacBook Air you could have a recent vintage
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.460]  iPad Pro
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:24.340]  Or you could have like the next year's iPhone and then they'd all charge with USB C
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:29.260]  And that certainly there is that is appealing I have to say
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.060]  Yeah, why wouldn't you?
[01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:38.500]  That was that was one of the funny things was one of the features that they announced for the iPad the new iPad Pro
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.340]  Is that you could charge your phone charge your iPhone from it?
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:45.500]  Which are we laugh because nobody has that cable, right?
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.220]  Unless you went out and bought it yourself, you don't have a USB C to lightning cable
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:55.860]  Yeah, it's it but on the other hand so I see it and you know
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:24:00.540]  And I don't know I would I be like shocked if next year's iPhone had a USB C port
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.500]  I guess I wouldn't be because you know and then you would think well
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:10.300]  I guess it kind of makes sense because now everything that uses a charging cable charges via USB C and the port is
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.340]  Bigger than a lightning port. It's a little thicker
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:19.820]  It is definitely wider, but you know, it's not thicker or wider enough that it would you know
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:22.300]  It doesn't seem impossible
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:22.900]  You know
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:24.900]  right like I have the pixel 3 here and
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:29.620]  The pixel 3 uses USB C and you stare at the bottom of the pixel and you stare at the bottom of an eye
[01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:35.980]  Recent iPhone and it doesn't look like the pixel has a bigger port. It is bigger, but it you know, it doesn't look bigger
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:42.860]  But on the other hand, I think Apple likes having a proprietary charger on the iPhone
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:49.580]  You know, but why but why specifically I mean I understand there's there are different there are some other pro reasons
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:54.680]  Why they want to put USB C on the iPad. Yeah, and if you listen to what they said about it
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:25:00.660]  It's like driving a 5k display. It is hooking it up to peripherals that I don't think would make sense
[01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.020]  Or as much sense hooking them up to an iPhone
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.420]  Do you think they'll get to the point where they will it like?
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.180]  Let you plug in a hard drive
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:13.180]  And access the file system somehow on an iPad. Yeah
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.980]  You can kind of do that now
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.020]  Do it with certain but you have to have like a touch of a third-party app or something
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.900]  Yeah, and then the third-party app has to like do the integration with the files app, right, you know
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:30.280]  And it's it all seems a bit crazy from a Mac users perspective
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.540]  You know
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.420]  Like it used to be before the Macintosh that it was
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.220]  Technically tricky to mount another storage device on a computer
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:49.220]  you you you as a user would have to do something to mount the disc and it was
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:56.100]  Quite a revelation with the Macintosh where it would I mean it was it would even suck the floppy disk in
[01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:03.340]  You know, you would start to put the floppy in and it would help fully like I see you're putting a floppy disk into me
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:07.460]  Here I'll take it and I will pull it in and then you didn't have to pull it out
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:13.300]  You you would eject it by dragging it to the trash and and it would pop the floppy disk right out
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:21.140]  but the fact that when you popped one in the disk just showed up on your desktop and there it was and it looked like
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:26.260]  A floppy disk it the icon of the thing that appeared on the desktop was a floppy disk. There it is
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.260]  It's in your computer mounted
[01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.580]  We take that for granted. That was you know a revelation
[01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:39.220]  And it made sense to everybody who used the Macintosh whether they knew what mounting a disk
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:41.500]  meant in any technical sense or not
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.640]  It seems weird that you have to get like a special app and then you know
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.940]  It only works with certain brand drives and then it doesn't really just appear on your iPad
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:54.260]  it's like now you go through the app and then it's in the files app and
[01:26:54.660 --> 01:27:00.780]  It all seems a bit convoluted like and I get it. I'm not saying that Apple should I'm not saying that
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:07.660]  That's a mistake because on the other hand the fact that you don't have to worry about storage on an iOS device, you know
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:13.300]  You never have to worry that you've taken out the SD card bird all of the data from your notes
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:20.500]  App is stored and now your notes app doesn't have that data because the disk the card isn't there or the disk isn't there
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:28.100]  But when you do want files from a disk it is it it really does seem like well shouldn't I just get a Macintosh?
[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:31.220]  right, so I don't know I I
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:37.860]  Kind of feel like external storage should show up in the files app and and there is a security argument about that, too
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:41.140]  right, there's you know that that you can get like a
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:47.260]  You know, there's there's USB thumb drives, you know that that that can be, you know
[01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:52.940]  There's security exploits that you you know, you get like a bad bad USB thumb drive and stick it in your computer
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:57.580]  Yeah, you can well that was that whole yeah, the whole thing with the North Korea thing was they were handing out those right?
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:28:03.220]  Those fans. They're handing out USB fans to reporters
[01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:07.140]  People on Twitter were like
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.700]  Keep keep cool and plug please plug this
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:26.220]  So there is a security angle there, but I almost feel like look that's you know, that's your problem Apple, you know, why don't you you know
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.580]  have
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:34.500]  Look at the code path from the USB subsystem and the sandboxing and make sure that there is no
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.620]  you know that you know that this this can be this can be done securely that you should be able to
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:42.580]  feel confident
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:49.500]  Plugging a North Korean USB fan into your iPad and not be worried that it's going to you know
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.260]  Take over your iPad
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:57.820]  it kind of I don't know it just seems to I think you're right that it you should be able to plug in external storage on
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.180]  These devices and have them show up in the files app. Yeah
[01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:06.420]  well, it's just you know, they want to take they want to make the iPad a real pro machine and
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:12.860]  That's got to come at some point right because there's you know, and and yeah sure what's what are the people doing?
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:13.220]  You know
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:19.100]  You can plug the camera right in and take all the images or the video footage right off the camera over
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:23.740]  USB C and and and a couple of people and and these aren't even Apple employees Apple had like
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:29.540]  Some folks from Adobe I told you, you know, we're there there were you know
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:34.060]  a bunch of non Apple people who'd been invited there and and everybody it reiterated
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:41.040]  Involving like video and photography that just unprompted they're like and seriously, this is so much faster at importing, you know
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:47.700]  Files photos and videos, you know, it really is faster like noticeably faster workflow. That's great
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:54.060]  But sometimes it is it's not a camera. It is just a disc or you're working with somebody, you know
[01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:55.340]  Like me and you are out there
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:30:02.140]  You know shooting video and you've got the video on your iPad and you I want to get that file from you
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:08.520]  And it's huge, you know, you know drop isn't the way to do it, right, you know
[01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.760]  It really does seem like you should be and we have a hard drive, you know
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.060]  We have an external SSD
[01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:17.820]  You should be able to like drag it to that SSD and then I should be able to plug it in like
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.940]  Sneaker net is often still the fastest way to move a really big file. Yeah
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:27.420]  And it does kind of stick out. Whereas if we were using two MacBooks of any kind
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.420]  That's exactly what we would do and it would work
[01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.860]  Yeah, so, I don't know. I
[01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.300]  Don't know where they're going with that. I
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.020]  Did hear I know another question I got asked is I did not get to try this
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:44.860]  I was already out of the hands-on area. So I can't I can't verify this but I asked Apple and they said yes
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:47.440]  Is in the previous generation of iPad pros?
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:54.380]  You could run two full-screen apps side-by-side on the bigger one the 12.9 inch but the the
[01:30:54.660 --> 01:31:00.880]  10.5 inch one you could run two apps side-by-side but not like 5050 where they're both quote-unquote full-screen
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.260]  You can do that now in the 11 inch
[01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:09.200]  iPad Pro hmm, which I think is a cooler way to multitask if you're doing that, you know
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.060]  so you don't have to have one of them in the
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:17.240]  What they call it compact view where it's effectively like the width of a phone even though it goes. Yeah, like a really tall skinny phone
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.800]  is that because you think that's because of the performance or because of
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.920]  Screen size difference. I don't know. Well, there's a different aspect ratio, right? Yeah
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.240]  It's slightly wider if you're if you're looking at it in landscape, you know
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.440]  Whether it's it's the long way, you know, like laptop mode
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:42.200]  It is slightly wider. It's got I just watched a developer video where they even said how many pixels it is
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:48.900]  It's like I don't know like 140 some pixels extra which is like half an inch. I don't know
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.440]  It's not real noticeable. I didn't notice it looking at the devices
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.920]  I only noticed it when I was told afterward that it's a slightly different aspect ratio. I don't know if that's the difference
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:03.120]  It doesn't seem like aspect ratio would be the explanation though because the twelve point nine inch one was always the old four to three
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.120]  Aspect ratio and had it. I
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.400]  Think it's some kind of performance thing. I
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.680]  Think that the you know, you know
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:14.440]  There was some kind of thing that was faster on the graphically faster on the bigger iPad Pro
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.800]  And now they both can do it without breaking a sweat, right? I don't know
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:23.160]  Trying to think what else it seems like it covers it
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.000]  It is when it's interesting that there's a thing that came out
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.120]  I don't I don't know the details on this but it's Stephen Troughton Smith. It seems to think that
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:39.680]  The one terabyte iPad pros and only the one terabyte iPad pros now have more RAM that they have six gigabytes of RAM instead
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:44.560]  Of four gigabytes of RAM, which is a little interesting. So it's six six compared to four not eight. Okay
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.040]  I don't know I could be wrong
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:51.920]  You have slightly more RAM, but that's kind of interesting and I don't quite get the use case for it and I'm with you
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.120]  I my iPads I don't need a lot of storage on my iPads. Yeah
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:59.440]  So the idea of a one terabyte iPad that seems crazy to me, but I get it that people are using it
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.140]  Completely. Yeah, you're gonna have you're gonna Photoshop. Yeah
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.960]  Yeah, that these Photoshop files can be a lot of people are gonna need them
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.520]  And so I guess if you're really serious about it, you need the more RAM, you know, I don't know
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.360]  It's it's it is the crazy thing that the crazy thing about these iPads as computers
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:23.320]  Is that they just sort of break your mental model of what a personal computer is, right?
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:27.240]  So so like the the MacBook Air brand new MacBook Air, it's gonna be super popular
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:34.480]  It is obviously gonna be Apple's pop most popular Mac and it's a computer exactly like we've always thought of them and you know
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.000]  You can get 8 gigs of RAM by default or you can go to 16 gigs of RAM and you know
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.320]  That's a nice upgrade for the the you know, non pro laptop
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:51.000]  The Mac Mini can go up to 64 gigs of RAM, which is a serious serious amount of RAM
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.760]  That's that's you know, I guess thousands of dollars. It's a lot of you know, that's a lot of RAM for
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160]  Yeah, previously
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.960]  Non pro device, you know, right, right the iPads, you know that traditionally, you know
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.240]  Apple doesn't talk about RAM and iPads which a is a little weird for a computer, right?
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:18.000]  That's weird. Like you wouldn't buy a Mac that you would never buy a Mac if Apple didn't tell you how much RAM was in
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000]  It it would just that would just be very strange
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.880]  but they've never talked about the RAM in iOS devices even though
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:29.760]  You can just get an app from the App Store and install it and it'll tell you how much RAM is in the device the apps
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.640]  No, Apple won't talk about it
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:38.760]  But it's so funny to think about the iPad Pro and how many ways it's more performant than the MacBook Air or even MacBook Pro's
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.840]  And yet it has less RAM way less RAM, which is really weird
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.200]  It's a very strange thing
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:51.400]  It's like just it's almost like an alternate universe version of what a personal computer is
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.400]  Then how can this thing be faster if it has so much less RAM?
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:02.120]  And it makes things like Photoshop very very tricky. I believe I think that the I think the hardest part of Photoshop on iPad
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:07.000]  I think I mentioned this last week is is the memory management, you know that the graphics is
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.800]  Mm-hmm easy because it's better. It's a better GPU CPU isn't constraining it anymore. The display is
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.920]  wonderful
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.960]  It's the RAM, you know, and in the demo on the on stage demo they showed yesterday if they said it was a three
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.080]  three gigabyte
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.880]  PSD file
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:33.160]  They actually told me afterwards that it actually wasn't a PSD file. It was actually a PSD file
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:35.440]  I don't even know this. I'm out of the loop on Photoshop
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.320]  It's a PSD file and that stands for Photoshop big
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.080]  I'm not making this up, but it's
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.920]  But it really if it's a three gigabyte file and they open it is plenty for me. I thought that was a great demo
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.840]  I don't know if you if you noticed this
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.320]  But I thought it was a really cool demo where it looked like they're editing this little section of a bunch of flowers
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.920]  Yes, and then and you think that's the whole demo and it's like they go through this thing and then she keeps going out
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.800]  Yeah, she keeps zooming out and out and out and then it's 3d and then oh, we're animating
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.920]  Right. Yeah, it was
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.440]  You know, what's that movie the Christopher Knoll the prestige, you know?
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.200]  It's like when you're doing a magic trick. It's not enough to do the trick
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:22.540]  there has to be the prestige at the end that's like the
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.820]  kicker that the Photoshop demo on the iPad had that prestige where it's like, oh and by the way, it's
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:32.780]  We were only looking at a little tiny corner of it. It's this big
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:38.200]  Yeah, and like you said and we're using these layers to do it in 3d and render it in it augmented reality
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]  And the butterflies animate
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.480]  That was really cool but it really show it look all of us when they zoomed out it's like oh, yeah
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.900]  That looks like it could be a three gigabyte file
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:55.800]  Now I understand but it's you think like well three gigabytes if it has four gigabytes of RAM, you know
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.880]  You can see how maybe they load the whole document and RAM but it's like, you know
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.040]  They have to keep the undo stack and right, you know, the it's more complicated. Oh, yeah
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:06.440]  right in the application, right it's
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.400]  And you know you might
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:16.860]  Well, which feels like something out of the old days on the Mac
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.200]  Maybe they're using RAM double-r, right?
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:28.560]  Maybe front ram double-r to the iPad. I think there's definitely some it truly advanced computer science going on
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.360]  Just in terms of memory management to make that work the way it does and it is absolutely not
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:39.320]  Surprising in the least that Adobe is is the company doing it, you know that they've got this history of
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:46.640]  You know memory management and stuff like that. It's it's truly. Yeah truly impressive. It's nice that flash thing is behind us
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:52.680]  Yeah, yeah, isn't it? Great to have is isn't it? Great to have Adobe on the on the right side of of computing
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.620]  All right, and and to be really excited about Adobe's new products. Yeah
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.300]  Well, I can't think of anything else that's a good wrap-up, okay, I thought was a fun event, you know, yeah
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.600]  What else I guess we could watch it
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:12.040]  I mean the only the only one weird thing was like they talked about how you know that how great they think it is
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.640]  That people do all this creative stuff with the Mac
[01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:19.720]  And now we're gonna show you a video about that and it was just like black-and-white pictures of people sitting in front of their Macs
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  Slideshow, it's like what?
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.960]  They didn't show anybody actually doing anything. No, that was a cuz I'd it was a little odd
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.760]  the other thing that I thought was weird about that slideshow of images was how many of them had a glowing Apple logo on the
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.420]  Whichever. Yeah laptops are going away. That is something that came up yesterday among a couple people
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:41.940]  There's a lot of people who are like, you know, I miss the glowing Apple logo
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:47.780]  You know, I think everybody does I think Apple knows, you know, but they've they've made the displays
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:49.820]  So then I don't I don't think they can do it anymore
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:55.660]  Yeah, I threw I had it. I had an old power book that had I had like scrap for parts and it was just sitting there
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:57.300]  It's like the aluminum one though
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.940]  like the one of the last ones and
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:03.140]  I just was cleaning my office out the other day and I decided to get finally get rid of it
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:07.500]  And I before I did though I pride that pride the lid off and I kept the lid
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.500]  I was thinking maybe I'll put some LEDs behind this. Yeah
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.460]  I
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:16.060]  That's pretty cool. I guess the other the only other thing to mention are things that didn't get updated
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:21.820]  No, no news about IMAX period or I might wear pods. I was hoping for airpods
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:26.860]  Yeah, no air pods and no no mention of air power
[01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.700]  Yeah
[01:39:29.700 --> 01:39:31.700]  Doesn't exist is
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.500]  got to be the I
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:41.500]  I I don't know what to make of it. I had nobody I couldn't even bring myself to ask about it
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:46.220]  I tried a month ago and it was so uncomfortable. I couldn't bring myself again
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:54.820]  Because I'm sure the answer didn't change, you know, but I not coming yesterday to me means it is not coming in 2018
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:59.660]  I mean, yeah, maybe they're so embarrassed about the airpower thing that they will just put it on sale
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:06.940]  You know someday in November and it just appear on that store and they're just don't even want to talk about it
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:12.900]  I don't know. They probably should I don't know. I don't know, you know, they won't say and and if there's anybody who you know
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.940]  At Apple who knows they're they're keeping their mouth shut as far as I can see
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:19.620]  So who knows it might ship in you know in November and times for the holidays
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:26.180]  But I I have to think that it isn't I don't know if it's ever going to ship to be honest, right?
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:31.100]  Right. It seems like there's a chance that it won't yeah, and you know, they're obviously all in on inductive charging
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.100]  and and they're saying that like the
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:38.280]  the inductive charging with the pencil and the side of the iPad is the
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:45.680]  They can't say for certain but they believe it's the smallest inductive charger ever made by any consumer electronics company
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:51.460]  You know, so they they are doing world-leading work in inductive charging
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:57.420]  And presumably if this air power ever ships you I I you know
[01:40:57.420 --> 01:41:03.460]  They obviously didn't mention it as a feature of Apple pencil, but I can only guess that it would charge charge on the pad, too
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:15.180]  I think the story with IMAX is nicer, you know, I our power is a disaster
[01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:18.180]  I think the story with IMAX is the iMac 5k's are great
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:25.100]  The iMac pros are great and they're it just like how I said like they're really only interested in meaningful updates
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:30.680]  They don't want a little 3% you know, well, we can swap the CPU out and you'll get the 4% better performance
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.100]  It's just that they don't see that as worthwhile
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:38.540]  Yeah, you know, they'll update these things when there's something they can do that makes them much better, you know
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:43.240]  Yeah, who knows what that is? I would hope it's face ID, but you know
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:47.060]  Presumably that's coming eventually. It would be nice if it came next year
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:52.180]  Yeah, but I feel like if it's not a serious serious update, they're not they're not doing it. Yeah
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.660]  That's about it
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:42:01.220]  Okay, John, thanks for coming back on the show after such a lengthy absence. I know I know I'd say I miss talking to you
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:04.580]  So once you're happy to do it once a year once a week
[01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.740]  Turning this car around famine. That's your yeah, the part of your
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:17.940]  Fatherhood podcast with uh-huh with people. I'm gonna mention them have the rebound with
[01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.500]  Lex and then
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:27.140]  I'm gonna mention again because guy loves it when I mentioned it is the speedy arrow cast this speedy arrow cast is yeah
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:29.860]  I and Dan guy and Dan and
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:36.900]  Life yeah, sorry, right another comic. Hey, is this daredevil show good? I've heard daredevil is good
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:40.960]  Yeah, I think this third season is quite good. Yeah that just came out. Yeah
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:45.040]  I like the first season the second season I thought started out really good and then Peter off
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:48.580]  But I think the third season is returned to form. Yeah. Yeah
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.740]  Some of the other shows are not necessarily so great
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:58.300]  Yeah, somebody else somebody else told me after last week's show that the hey don't don't hesitate that the new Star Trek Discovery is great
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:01.440]  You know you did, you know, if you like Star Trek at all, you're gonna love this
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.080]  So I've got it. I don't know when I'm gonna start maybe it'll be like a Christmas thing and I'll watch it with the boy
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:12.800]  Yeah, I've got it on my list. I'm gonna watch the Star Trek. All right. Well, then I'll talk to you about it then
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:37.800]  Yeah, you're from now
