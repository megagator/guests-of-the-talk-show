[00:00.000 --> 00:05.920]  We have scandals to talk about now because you and I appeared on CNBC's Squawk Alley together,
[00:05.920 --> 00:07.600]  and we created a webcam gate.
[00:09.840 --> 00:16.400]  Truly, truly the outrage, the outrage that I would dare to say that the webcam is not good,
[00:17.200 --> 00:20.560]  the outrage, which you have said, and you know what, we should begin here.
[00:20.560 --> 00:22.480]  We should start with it.
[00:22.480 --> 00:27.200]  I want to apologize to you. I've felt very badly about a couple of things.
[00:27.200 --> 00:33.120]  The first thing is, I said I looked better on air than you, which is true, but I'm sorry I said it.
[00:34.640 --> 00:35.840]  It should go unsaid.
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.640]  It shouldn't have been said out loud, so I'm sorry for that.
[00:40.640 --> 00:46.960]  Second of all, I stole your word, and honestly, in my head, I wanted to say,
[00:47.520 --> 00:51.360]  can I say craptastic on air? And then they answered me and said,
[00:51.360 --> 00:55.840]  okay, anyway, that's John's word. He used it in his review, but he's right.
[00:55.840 --> 01:00.160]  He's right, but I got derailed, and I didn't give you credit.
[01:00.160 --> 01:03.040]  So your word is craptastic.
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.200]  Well, it's fantastic. Your word is fantastic, but the word craptastic is a word you used
[01:09.200 --> 01:15.360]  to describe the webcams in your review, and I said it on live national TV,
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.920]  and I passed it off as my own, and that was wrong.
[01:17.920 --> 01:18.320]  All right.
[01:18.320 --> 01:19.200]  I'm very sorry.
[01:20.480 --> 01:24.480]  I've spent the last 48 hours on a deep dive on this very issue.
[01:24.480 --> 01:28.160]  The webcam quality aside, all I've done is look into this language.
[01:28.160 --> 01:30.960]  It turns out you didn't quite steal my word.
[01:30.960 --> 01:33.120]  You did say craptastic.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.160]  You did try to steal my word, but my word from my review was craptacular.
[01:41.520 --> 01:48.960]  Oh, I would like to take back the last five minutes of this recording.
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.280]  This is how deep down the rabbit hole we are.
[01:52.560 --> 01:53.520]  I am so sorry.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.160]  I'm sorry to all the listeners.
[01:56.160 --> 01:56.800]  I was wrong.
[01:56.800 --> 01:59.040]  I did not mean to apologize actually for anything.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.280]  Uh, anyway, craptacular, craptastic, however you want to talk about it.
[02:05.280 --> 02:11.360]  This was, and so I'm enjoying, you do TV more than me, and you do video weekly with the
[02:11.360 --> 02:12.640]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:12.640 --> 02:18.160]  I've started doing these CNBC hits, and I enjoy it, even though it stresses me to no
[02:18.160 --> 02:22.480]  end, but I basically have agreed to start doing it, and they've been very politely asking
[02:22.480 --> 02:27.760]  me for years because, A, I'm home and the timing works out.
[02:27.760 --> 02:31.600]  Like when I'm, a lot of times over the years, they've asked me like, oh, there's a big
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.200]  Apple event and it's in California.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.880]  Can you do a hit on CNBC?
[02:35.520 --> 02:39.040]  And then it's like, it would require you to be somewhere in downtown San Francisco at
[02:39.040 --> 02:41.200]  five 30 in the morning Pacific time.
[02:41.200 --> 02:42.800]  And it's like, no, sorry.
[02:43.440 --> 02:44.640]  I know the ask very well.
[02:44.640 --> 02:45.760]  I know the ask very well.
[02:45.760 --> 02:46.720]  Not going to happen.
[02:47.760 --> 02:51.520]  It's like I'm going to be inside the event at that moment covering it.
[02:51.520 --> 02:53.920]  How will I be on your television show too?
[02:53.920 --> 02:54.420]  Right.
[02:55.680 --> 03:00.240]  Or I'm not going to get up at four in the morning and go do it.
[03:00.240 --> 03:02.160]  It's not worth it.
[03:02.160 --> 03:06.080]  But when I can do it from home and I don't have to go anywhere, it's good.
[03:06.080 --> 03:10.480]  And the CNBC hosts are very knowledgeable.
[03:10.480 --> 03:14.320]  For people who are talking about all sorts of business, anything that pops up all during
[03:14.320 --> 03:18.800]  the day, the hosts on Squawk Alley, like John Ford, all the questions are great.
[03:18.800 --> 03:19.600]  John Ford pulled out a...
[03:19.600 --> 03:20.400]  Oh, they're the best.
[03:20.400 --> 03:25.600]  He pulled out, is this the biggest thing for the max since the next acquisition?
[03:27.520 --> 03:29.680]  And I don't think that's an exaggeration.
[03:29.680 --> 03:33.760]  I think that's actually a good analogy, but how many people on TV business news could
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.400]  pull that out?
[03:35.280 --> 03:36.400]  Oh, they're the best.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.800]  I mean, that show in particular, but I'm on a lot of CNBC shows and it's always...
[03:41.440 --> 03:44.560]  One thing I've done a lot of TV in my time and it's...
[03:44.560 --> 03:47.440]  They always want to get you to say something, right?
[03:47.440 --> 03:52.800]  So you could say it and it'd be some controversial thing and that's a good soundbite.
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.320]  I never feel that way with all the CNBC shows that I'm on.
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.680]  And yeah, especially Squawk Alley with Carl, John, and depends on who else the other anchor
[04:01.680 --> 04:02.320]  is stepping in.
[04:02.320 --> 04:07.280]  But this week it was Julia and they're all wonderful and they really know their stuff.
[04:07.280 --> 04:10.000]  Yeah, and I can tell exactly that.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.240]  And you think faster than I do.
[04:12.240 --> 04:13.200]  You're meant for video.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.800]  I think slow and I get caught up and I'm like, oh, I've been trapped and I can't figure
[04:16.800 --> 04:19.840]  my way out of the trap and next thing I know the hit's over and my time is gone.
[04:20.400 --> 04:23.920]  I don't want to get trapped into that like, hey, we're trying to get you to say something,
[04:24.720 --> 04:25.680]  a news bite.
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.840]  I always get the sense with them that they really just want to get to the kernel of truth.
[04:29.840 --> 04:31.520]  What's the deal with these MacBooks?
[04:31.520 --> 04:32.960]  What's the deal with the new iPhone?
[04:33.680 --> 04:34.880]  And I really appreciate that.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.760]  So I keep doing it.
[04:36.480 --> 04:39.440]  But the other thing is it does go fast, right?
[04:39.440 --> 04:40.320]  It's so fast.
[04:41.040 --> 04:41.920]  You're on.
[04:41.920 --> 04:44.720]  They do a great job of getting you ready to go.
[04:44.720 --> 04:49.040]  But and it is so much more convenient doing this remotely.
[04:49.040 --> 04:52.240]  But it's also sort of like doing it blind, right?
[04:52.880 --> 04:54.400]  Like you're just there.
[04:55.040 --> 04:59.840]  There's a little voice from a control room person who's very professional and very nice.
[04:59.840 --> 05:04.080]  And they seem very keenly aware of how in the dark you are.
[05:04.080 --> 05:06.080]  But it's like, you know, they cut to a commercial.
[05:06.080 --> 05:08.000]  They're like, okay, you're on after the commercial.
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.280]  But then you see nothing.
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.040]  It's like you don't get to watch the commercials or anything and you're just like, okay.
[05:13.040 --> 05:15.840]  And then I've gotten pretty used to it.
[05:15.840 --> 05:20.640]  I've been I was doing these pretty frequently, actually, before COVID.
[05:20.640 --> 05:24.720]  And then after COVID, I've definitely I mean, there was a bunch of time where they were
[05:24.720 --> 05:27.280]  definitely not interested in tech news, understandably.
[05:27.280 --> 05:28.480]  So I wasn't called a lot.
[05:28.480 --> 05:31.760]  But over the last couple of months, doing a lot of these and actually I'm a contributor.
[05:31.760 --> 05:35.760]  So I probably should watch what I say about CNBC, though.
[05:35.760 --> 05:38.320]  Everything I say here is I've been completely honest.
[05:39.040 --> 05:41.520]  But one thing I look like such an idiot.
[05:41.520 --> 05:45.360]  I'm just sitting in front of my computer smiling for like, usually three minutes before these
[05:45.360 --> 05:48.480]  things start, which I think is just like, hilarious.
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.080]  Just like, I mean, nobody else is around, but I don't know when it's like, gonna really
[05:52.080 --> 05:57.360]  start to sit here, like smiling like a true asshole, just like, Oh, you're gonna talk
[05:57.360 --> 05:58.240]  to me yet?
[05:58.240 --> 05:58.880]  Are they on me?
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.520]  I mean, like, my dog is probably like, What the fuck is she doing?
[06:03.520 --> 06:03.760]  Right?
[06:04.640 --> 06:08.640]  You sit there in your office chair where you usually have no self awareness at all.
[06:08.640 --> 06:11.040]  And I'm just slumped with the worst possible posture.
[06:11.040 --> 06:15.440]  Meanwhile, I'm sitting there like I'm, I'm on stage ready to get called up to get like
[06:15.440 --> 06:20.720]  an award or something, you know, ramrod straight back, right, where shoulders looking straight
[06:20.720 --> 06:21.280]  ahead.
[06:21.280 --> 06:25.360]  And it's like, and then this time, I got panic too.
[06:25.360 --> 06:31.520]  And it's like, usually, I can, I'll feel free to like, dig around on my phone, right?
[06:31.520 --> 06:32.800]  I don't want to mess with my computer.
[06:32.800 --> 06:35.200]  But I'll sit down like, well, I've got a couple minutes here.
[06:35.200 --> 06:39.840]  And then all of a sudden, I remembered that with all the latest software updates, there's
[06:39.840 --> 06:44.960]  the magic switching of AirPods Pro, which I was using for my audio and my input.
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.160]  And I was like, wait, I don't want to mess this up with my phone and have the AirPods
[06:50.160 --> 06:51.200]  switch over to the phone.
[06:51.200 --> 06:52.560]  And then they're not on the Mac.
[06:52.560 --> 06:54.160]  And it's like, I don't think that would work.
[06:54.160 --> 06:55.360]  I think it's supposed to be smart.
[06:55.360 --> 06:57.760]  But it's like, you don't want to mess with it when you're supposed to go on TV.
[06:57.760 --> 07:00.960]  So I was like, and I'm like, Oh, I should have had like a magazine here.
[07:02.640 --> 07:03.280]  I'm nothing.
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.240]  No, you're like, basically in a green, a virtual green room, except like the cameras pointing
[07:08.240 --> 07:09.200]  at you always.
[07:09.200 --> 07:11.840]  But yeah, the flying blind thing is tough.
[07:11.840 --> 07:16.640]  Because when you used to be on set with an anchor and some other guests, what I always
[07:16.640 --> 07:18.560]  really liked is they would book me with another guest.
[07:18.560 --> 07:20.640]  So we would kind of maybe even tussle at all.
[07:20.640 --> 07:23.840]  They even said in our thing, like, I've never seen two guests agree so much.
[07:23.840 --> 07:27.680]  They definitely like to have some difference of opinion.
[07:29.120 --> 07:32.160]  In fact, there's like one great one where I just told the guys flat out wrong.
[07:32.160 --> 07:33.040]  And I was like, I bet him.
[07:33.040 --> 07:34.560]  I was like, you're totally wrong.
[07:34.560 --> 07:36.080]  Apple is not going to announce that.
[07:36.080 --> 07:39.280]  And but here, I can't see you.
[07:39.280 --> 07:40.240]  I can't see them.
[07:40.240 --> 07:44.800]  And I even felt like, oh, I would, you know, mention john, but I don't is john on camera
[07:44.800 --> 07:45.520]  with me right now.
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.920]  We had to, you know, are we a split screen?
[07:47.920 --> 07:48.320]  Are we?
[07:48.320 --> 07:49.360]  Am I just me?
[07:49.360 --> 07:50.560]  Is it just him?
[07:50.560 --> 07:52.640]  So that is and you can't see the anchors.
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.880]  I haven't actually seen the anchors face to face since like, I don't know February.
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.320]  Yeah, I did.
[07:58.320 --> 08:01.040]  I saw john when we were I don't know how it worked.
[08:01.040 --> 08:01.920]  I don't know what they were.
[08:01.920 --> 08:06.800]  But like, like two weeks ago, when I was talking about the phones, I didn't see anybody.
[08:06.800 --> 08:09.920]  And this time, I did see john, but I didn't see you.
[08:10.640 --> 08:12.400]  I was all crazy.
[08:12.400 --> 08:16.000]  Yeah, I think you get the feed sometimes of like, whatever's in the studio.
[08:16.000 --> 08:16.720]  Yeah.
[08:16.720 --> 08:16.880]  Yeah.
[08:16.880 --> 08:18.800]  Sometimes I see Carl, I guess.
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.240]  And when I do the morning show, I've seen Mike, I believe.
[08:24.240 --> 08:25.120]  Yeah, anyway.
[08:25.120 --> 08:30.160]  Well, anyway, the thing that we had hard time, we just didn't have enough time to get out
[08:30.160 --> 08:34.960]  is that we're not it made it seem as though you and I were arguing over the camera where
[08:34.960 --> 08:39.440]  you said the camera is crap tastic, trying to steal my word, but coming up with your
[08:39.440 --> 08:41.920]  own made up crappier word.
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.880]  And then I interjected with Well, I'm using it right now.
[08:46.880 --> 08:51.680]  And I was and I had no idea if it looked good or not.
[08:52.320 --> 08:54.240]  I wasn't trying to like refute you.
[08:54.240 --> 08:59.280]  But I realized, in hindsight, it came across as me saying, Well, I'm using it and it looks
[08:59.280 --> 08:59.600]  great.
[08:59.600 --> 09:03.280]  I didn't know what it looked like, you know, I tested it side by side, I knew it looked
[09:03.280 --> 09:04.240]  better than the old ones.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.640]  But it made it seem like we disagree.
[09:08.640 --> 09:10.240]  Like you say these cameras stink.
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.520]  And I'm saying I love them.
[09:11.520 --> 09:12.400]  I think it's so great.
[09:12.400 --> 09:14.240]  I used it to go on TV.
[09:14.240 --> 09:18.240]  Whereas I think the truth is, we actually even further, here's the one point where it
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.960]  seemed like maybe we had like a little point of, hey, this is fun, you know, on TV, but
[09:22.960 --> 09:29.280]  we actually, I think completely agree, which is that the camera still stinks overall, but
[09:29.280 --> 09:32.640]  it is way better than the MacBook cameras before.
[09:34.480 --> 09:36.960]  Yes, we definitely agree on all of that.
[09:36.960 --> 09:39.120]  I wouldn't say way better.
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.600]  Maybe we can we can mildly hash out how much better way better, right?
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.720]  Because in my video, not the CNBC video, but the Wall Street Journal review video that
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.280]  I did, I did have a short place where I actually used the webcam quite a bit.
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  And I had a short place where I showed both side by side, I think that you could really
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.320]  see in that frame and lighting was good.
[10:00.320 --> 10:03.760]  So it was a good place to see both looked fine.
[10:03.760 --> 10:11.520]  But the difference between the I think I was yes, I was definitely using the 2020 Intel
[10:11.520 --> 10:19.520]  MacBook Air on one side and the 2020 M1 MacBook Air and it's a little bit brighter, you definitely
[10:19.520 --> 10:25.920]  can see there's like less compression and you can also see that there's just like better
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.000]  lighting or more even lighting, which are all the things that Apple said was going to
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.480]  be improved here using machine learning and no actual upgrade to the hardware.
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.640]  But it's still just not as good as a dedicated webcam, one you'd buy from Logitech, one you
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.840]  use on your iPhone, one that in the case of CNBC what happened, I want to explain here,
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.280]  I decided a couple of weeks ago, I needed to up my CNBC game, I was using my iPhone
[10:51.280 --> 10:59.920]  using camo, this software, camo, I was using that on the Mac, and on the iPhone, and it
[10:59.920 --> 11:00.880]  was working great.
[11:00.880 --> 11:01.680]  I liked it a lot.
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.720]  But it wasn't like looking as good, frankly, as Neelai Patel, who also is a CNBC contributor.
[11:06.720 --> 11:07.840]  And sometimes we're on together.
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.280]  And I'm like, I can't have Neelai look better than me like that's not okay.
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.800]  And so I was using I decided I'm going to do what he was doing, which is hooking up
[11:14.800 --> 11:20.720]  my Sony camera, my Sony RX 100 to my computer, I got a HDMI connector, I did all the things.
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.000]  And so I was like, really excited, because this is my first time using that on air.
[11:25.280 --> 11:30.240]  And it's like night and day better than a webcam in a MacBook.
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.960]  So what I think happened, or I know what happened is, first of all, in zoom, in the zoom window,
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.520]  where I connect with CNBC, I looked very good.
[11:38.320 --> 11:44.560]  I was very crisp, you could see the full view of my window, or my background.
[11:44.560 --> 11:47.600]  And then CNBC crops into that pretty significantly.
[11:47.600 --> 11:53.680]  Then CNBC is running that through zoom through their own software or some sort of what's
[11:53.680 --> 12:00.560]  it called, forget the technical name that they use in TV, switcher or something.
[12:00.560 --> 12:02.720]  And so that's further compressing it.
[12:02.720 --> 12:04.480]  Plus, I was dumb.
[12:04.480 --> 12:06.800]  And I didn't get the Ethernet dongle.
[12:06.800 --> 12:12.160]  Actually, it wasn't dumb, honestly, the MacBook, the 13 inch MacBook Pro only has two USB ports,
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.480]  which is infuriating to me because I've been coming from the 16 inch where I had all the
[12:16.480 --> 12:19.440]  things hooked up, and I decided not to use Ethernet.
[12:19.440 --> 12:26.720]  So I was on my not that great Wi Fi, and all those things compounded to make my video not
[12:26.720 --> 12:27.360]  look great.
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.640]  Versus you who are just actually having a very simple webcam, using the simple webcam,
[12:34.640 --> 12:40.640]  which looked fine, but like definitely did not look as good as the image that was really
[12:40.640 --> 12:42.560]  coming out of my system.
[12:42.560 --> 12:55.440]  Yeah, I feel like side by side, it's a very interesting example of proving that the M1
[12:55.440 --> 13:01.680]  chip and using Apple Silicon and having this pipeline where the camera feeds directly into
[13:01.680 --> 13:10.880]  the M1 and it even helps with security where the M1 can electronically gate whether software
[13:10.880 --> 13:13.680]  has access to the camera and make sure the green light goes on.
[13:15.280 --> 13:19.440]  But it goes through the I guess there is I think they do say there's machine learning
[13:19.440 --> 13:20.000]  involved too.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.560]  But I know there's an image signal processing chip that before the computer, the Mac software
[13:26.560 --> 13:32.000]  ever even sees the image, the image signaling processor chip already has cleaned up the
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.440]  image in a way that on the Intel MacBooks to date, that doesn't happen.
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.800]  And it's a great example of okay, here's here's this real crappy 720p camera.
[13:40.800 --> 13:42.240]  Here's what it looks like on Intel.
[13:42.240 --> 13:47.120]  And we're, you know, it's not like Apple was spent years purposefully making it look
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.320]  worse, because they knew the M1 was coming.
[13:50.320 --> 13:52.720]  It's like, I'm sure they were trying.
[13:52.720 --> 13:57.920]  But now with this image signaling processor, you get this better image and it's definitely
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.160]  less noisy at same camera, but it's a lot less noisy.
[14:02.160 --> 14:05.520]  They're definitely, definitely white balance improvements.
[14:07.520 --> 14:12.240]  And you see that more at nighttime, like so one of the cheats I had for the CNBC thing
[14:12.240 --> 14:17.360]  is doing at 11am Eastern Time, I get really nice natural light in my office.
[14:17.360 --> 14:18.960]  And that helps a lot.
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.320]  When I was doing tests for my review, I shot a lot of it at night.
[14:22.880 --> 14:28.560]  You know, my office has fine office lighting, but it's you know, incandescent office lighting.
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.360]  And it's just amazing how blue you look.
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.280]  And it shouldn't be it should be, if anything, it should be warm.
[14:35.280 --> 14:38.160]  It just totally throws it off the noises off the charts.
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.680]  But then there's, you know, you don't have to be like a super picky professional to start
[14:43.680 --> 14:46.080]  noticing, hey, they're cheating here.
[14:46.080 --> 14:50.480]  Like they're doing like the Barbara Walters filter where they're like looking for faces,
[14:50.480 --> 14:56.720]  and then they just sort of electronically smear gauze all over it, you know, it's like, so
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.520]  my face, your face on this camera doesn't look as noisy as did on the old on the Intel
[15:03.520 --> 15:05.200]  MacBooks, which is terrible.
[15:05.200 --> 15:08.000]  And the color temperature is way better.
[15:08.640 --> 15:13.520]  But as soon as you look for that gauzy, well, they're just sort of blurring your face.
[15:13.520 --> 15:14.960]  And it's like, Oh, yeah, I see that.
[15:14.960 --> 15:15.680]  That's a cheat.
[15:15.680 --> 15:16.720]  And it doesn't look good.
[15:16.720 --> 15:22.000]  It's not I mean, it looks better than, you know, before, but it's you can start seeing
[15:22.000 --> 15:22.720]  how they're cheating.
[15:22.720 --> 15:27.520]  Yeah. And you also I think there's using the same one of the big things that I noticed
[15:27.520 --> 15:33.280]  on my on the 16 inch MacBook Pro is the like reaction to light sources.
[15:33.840 --> 15:36.480]  Do you ever notice that it's just like completely blown out?
[15:37.760 --> 15:39.440]  Yeah, yeah, yes, totally.
[15:39.440 --> 15:39.840]  Yeah.
[15:39.840 --> 15:42.720]  And that is also much better here.
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.760]  So if I have like a big light behind me, not like, like a big window, but even just like
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.840]  a lamp in back of me, that is less blown out.
[15:51.840 --> 15:53.200]  Yeah.
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.960]  No, it's that they made improvements.
[15:54.960 --> 15:56.800]  They certainly made improvements.
[15:56.800 --> 16:00.160]  But it's going to get better.
[16:00.160 --> 16:01.760]  It can get so much better.
[16:01.760 --> 16:07.600]  And again, this is something I just keep thinking they know what they've put a 1080p hammer
[16:07.600 --> 16:08.240]  on the iMac.
[16:08.960 --> 16:12.000]  They're also using their some software to improve that.
[16:12.960 --> 16:13.840]  That's where it's headed.
[16:13.840 --> 16:16.560]  That's what we should have on these these brand new systems.
[16:17.200 --> 16:21.760]  But I'm not going to complain too much about it because these brand new systems are truly
[16:21.760 --> 16:22.240]  amazing.
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.720]  I feel like what they've and I think it makes hindsight.
[16:28.720 --> 16:30.240]  In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense.
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.480]  But it's they honestly changed nothing that they didn't have to change.
[16:35.040 --> 16:40.160]  I mean, it is externally and I had one side by side.
[16:40.160 --> 16:42.560]  There is no physical difference.
[16:42.560 --> 16:45.920]  I only had the MacBook Pro, by the way, you see, it sounds like from your review, you
[16:45.920 --> 16:49.280]  had the air like the 999 air, right?
[16:49.280 --> 16:52.880]  I had the it's 12.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.760]  I forget the exact number 1250.
[16:55.760 --> 16:56.560]  Let me look it up.
[16:56.560 --> 17:03.760]  I had slightly better than the 999 because as the eight core CPU, the GPU, you mean?
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.640]  Yeah, yeah, sorry, the eight core GPU and but still had eight gigabytes of RAM, right?
[17:08.640 --> 17:13.760]  So it's a little bit of an odd config, but it's like the second bump up on their site.
[17:13.760 --> 17:20.320]  Um, but it like physically compared side by side with the Intel versions that are the
[17:20.320 --> 17:24.720]  latest and greatest, you really have to turn them on to see that there's anything unless
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.280]  you happen to know the model number and the model number is literally printed in the smallest
[17:29.280 --> 17:33.360]  type on the bottom plate that you could possibly read.
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.880]  And you just have to know that like a 2338 is Oh, that's an M1 MacBook.
[17:38.880 --> 17:43.760]  Otherwise, the hardware is like, the same, it's the same trackpad, the same keyboard,
[17:43.760 --> 17:49.360]  same touch bar, the same buttons, the same screens, you know, where the pro has this
[17:49.360 --> 17:56.880]  500 nit Mac screen and the air is 400 nit the same bezels that, you know, by today's
[17:56.880 --> 18:02.080]  laptop standards are maybe slightly dated, the same color options, the same webcam, it's
[18:02.080 --> 18:02.720]  all internal.
[18:02.720 --> 18:06.640]  And, and, and I know people are disappointed by that, like, and you know, and there's a
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.560]  part of me that was like, Well, why couldn't we have everything?
[18:08.560 --> 18:12.560]  Why can't this just be the greatest day in MacBook history, and we get new form factors
[18:12.560 --> 18:16.640]  and new cameras and everything, you know, they're thinner and lighter, and they look
[18:16.640 --> 18:18.080]  just plain look cooler.
[18:18.080 --> 18:21.920]  But now that it's out, it's like, Oh, this seems pretty obvious.
[18:21.920 --> 18:25.200]  They had so much to change just by changing the architectures.
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.400]  Why take a chance changing anything else?
[18:29.680 --> 18:32.880]  And it's pun intended with this.
[18:32.880 --> 18:34.960]  It's an apples to apples comparison.
[18:34.960 --> 18:40.000]  And that's what made this review, I think so spectacular, or the testing of this so
[18:40.000 --> 18:40.640]  spectacular.
[18:40.640 --> 18:44.000]  So sitting next to me, I've got a huge stack of MacBooks, right?
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.960]  I had the Intel version, pretty much the exact Intel version of both systems.
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.360]  I had the Intel version of the air that was released back in March.
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.680]  And I had the Intel version of the 13 inch pro that was released, I believe back in April
[18:57.680 --> 18:58.160]  or May.
[18:58.720 --> 19:03.520]  And I tested side by side, and I'd use those systems over the last number of months.
[19:03.520 --> 19:10.240]  And again, because you had the same hardware, and basically, I mean, I believe the same
[19:10.240 --> 19:16.480]  battery and the same sort of external other things that they didn't change, you could
[19:16.480 --> 19:18.080]  make this crazy comparison.
[19:18.080 --> 19:23.040]  You could run battery tests side by side and actually see eight hours difference.
[19:23.040 --> 19:27.520]  You could run side by side the same exact tests like I did with with, you know, opening
[19:27.520 --> 19:30.400]  100 Chrome tabs or playing the same game.
[19:30.400 --> 19:37.120]  And I would actually just like shoot the thermometer gun at the M1 chip and see like it was 10
[19:37.120 --> 19:41.040]  to 15 degrees cooler than the Intel version.
[19:41.040 --> 19:48.000]  And so it was like, it truly was like a reviewer's paradise in terms of like, testing these things,
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.280]  as I said, apples to apples.
[19:49.280 --> 19:51.760]  I really wish that I had thought of the thermometer trick.
[19:51.760 --> 19:54.800]  I still haven't even tried it because we bought, I don't have the gun.
[19:54.800 --> 20:00.400]  But we have like a little Nokia thing that we bought at the beginning of this coronavirus
[20:00.400 --> 20:02.080]  thing, which is amazing.
[20:02.080 --> 20:04.240]  It is just this amazing little thing.
[20:04.240 --> 20:09.040]  And it's the coolest thing I've seen from Nokia in like, I don't know, since it's like
[20:09.040 --> 20:10.080]  the little curved.
[20:10.080 --> 20:14.720]  Yeah, yeah, like, it's almost looks like a suction cup, like a Nerf dart top, and you
[20:14.720 --> 20:17.600]  just, you know, wave it over the forehead for a wave or two.
[20:17.600 --> 20:19.680]  And it looks like a thermometer from Star Trek.
[20:19.680 --> 20:22.240]  And it's like, you know, and then it just gives you a number.
[20:22.240 --> 20:27.360]  And, you know, we've just been sitting here taking our temperatures a couple times a day
[20:27.360 --> 20:28.560]  every day since March.
[20:30.240 --> 20:31.200]  Because it's fine.
[20:31.200 --> 20:31.700]  Right.
[20:32.480 --> 20:34.560]  But I really thought, oh, I should have tried that.
[20:34.560 --> 20:38.000]  I was so jealous when you tried that, because all I did was like, put my fingers on it.
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.400]  And I'm like, damn, this thing is not getting hotter.
[20:40.400 --> 20:40.640]  Why?
[20:40.640 --> 20:40.960]  What?
[20:40.960 --> 20:41.600]  Why?
[20:41.600 --> 20:45.600]  I thought that running this blank for 10 minutes should have made this get hotter.
[20:45.600 --> 20:46.400]  What is going on?
[20:48.160 --> 20:49.360]  I was very jealous of that.
[20:49.360 --> 20:53.920]  Yeah, I mean, it's funny, like when the whole thermometer thing happened.
[20:53.920 --> 20:57.680]  I've had that one for a long time from my old laptop testing days.
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.240]  Oh, it's probably not that old, but I've upgraded it.
[21:00.240 --> 21:03.840]  But sometimes now, you know, there was that whole debate about what kind of thermometer
[21:03.840 --> 21:06.960]  should you really be using, like surface thermometers.
[21:06.960 --> 21:13.680]  And in a couple of photos, and this one I have is very much a equipment thermometer.
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.960]  It's meant for measuring surfaces of objects, not people, not skin.
[21:18.960 --> 21:24.000]  But I've seen in some photos, like Getty Images types of things like people using these,
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.040]  like these types of thermometers to measure skin temperature.
[21:27.040 --> 21:28.800]  And that's just completely wrong.
[21:28.800 --> 21:31.120]  Like, you don't get a very accurate reading.
[21:32.320 --> 21:34.960]  So maybe I shouldn't have used my Nokia.
[21:34.960 --> 21:37.680]  Yeah, I don't think that would be I mean, you could try.
[21:37.680 --> 21:39.680]  I mean, look, what you really need is a baseline, right?
[21:39.680 --> 21:42.240]  Like, I didn't even really report I did report some of the numbers.
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.240]  But like, what you really want to see is the delta, right?
[21:44.240 --> 21:50.320]  Like the M1 is 70 degrees and the Intel is 90, right?
[21:50.320 --> 21:52.240]  You're like crazy 20 degree difference.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.380]  Yeah.
[21:54.480 --> 21:56.400]  Well, we know where to pick this back up.
[21:56.400 --> 21:59.280]  I'm going to take a break here to thank our first sponsor before we keep going.
[21:59.280 --> 22:01.760]  We're going to pick up with talking about thermometers.
[22:01.760 --> 22:04.240]  Yeah, man, do I love this company Linode.
[22:04.240 --> 22:07.040]  Linode hosts everything at Daring Fireball.
[22:07.040 --> 22:14.160]  I love this company, web hosting, just great prices, great service, great technology.

[22:48.000 --> 22:51.440]  They have 11 global data centers around the world.
[22:51.440 --> 22:53.200]  I mean, they're not kidding about global.
[22:53.200 --> 22:56.960]  I mean, like India and Europe and just everywhere.
[22:58.320 --> 23:03.200]  They also have amazing technical support that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[23:03.200 --> 23:08.800]  365 days a year with no tiers or handoffs regardless of your plan size.
[23:08.800 --> 23:13.040]  It's not like because you're on a cheap low cost $5 a month plan,
[23:13.040 --> 23:14.720]  you get like the B team for support.
[23:14.720 --> 23:16.240]  You get the same support.
[23:16.240 --> 23:17.040]  It's fantastic.

[23:22.880 --> 23:27.280]  unmanaged Kubernetes, which I've been told I am pronouncing right and more.
[23:28.000 --> 23:35.200]  So anyway, go to linode.com slash the talk show and click on create free account to get started.
[23:35.200 --> 23:39.440]  My thanks to Linode for sponsoring the show and for hosting during Fireball.
[23:40.080 --> 23:41.840]  So anyway, that is one of the little things.
[23:41.840 --> 23:46.320]  That's like one of those things that using this and all right,
[23:46.320 --> 23:51.200]  Apple makes their announcement and then we have some press briefings and then they ship it.
[23:51.200 --> 23:52.080]  That's the weird part.
[23:52.080 --> 23:54.240]  Usually it's like you get in person.
[23:54.240 --> 23:59.920]  They give you these things in hand and you have to sign away an NDA and stuff.
[23:59.920 --> 24:01.280]  And now you can't do any of that.
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.320]  They have to ship them to you.
[24:03.840 --> 24:06.320]  But we're talking about it before we get to like play.
[24:06.320 --> 24:08.160]  We have no hands on time with these things.
[24:08.160 --> 24:08.800]  We're talking to them.
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.400]  And the one thing that I was told by a couple of people at Apple was like,
[24:13.360 --> 24:15.600]  just these things run so cool.
[24:15.600 --> 24:16.720]  It is amazing.
[24:16.720 --> 24:20.960]  And it's like, okay, that sounds great, but you know, I'm sure they get hot eventually.
[24:20.960 --> 24:22.560]  I couldn't make the damn thing get hot.
[24:24.160 --> 24:25.440]  I tried so hard.
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.040]  I mean, that was the whole basis of my video because when I started trying, I was like,
[24:29.040 --> 24:30.480]  you know what I think I need to do?
[24:30.480 --> 24:38.080]  Document this in visual form because I was trying so hard to get these things warm.
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.480]  I mean, it started with the air because it's like, okay, it's fanless.
[24:42.480 --> 24:45.040]  It's got to hit some point where it gets really warm.
[24:45.040 --> 24:47.840]  And we should talk about that, but that doesn't really happen because it just
[24:47.840 --> 24:50.560]  tamps down on the performance versus like get really warm.
[24:51.440 --> 24:55.840]  But still, it's amazing what you can do with that thing before it starts to just say,
[24:55.840 --> 24:58.720]  okay, I'm going to give up and I can't do what you're asking me to do.
[25:00.080 --> 25:05.360]  Everything from gaming to running the 100 Chrome tabs to video calling.
[25:05.360 --> 25:09.360]  And with the Pro, I was like, okay, well, what does it take to get the fan to go on?
[25:09.920 --> 25:14.000]  So I did, again, tons and tons of tests.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.240]  And when I finally got it to go on, I couldn't, and I was doing this,
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.440]  I mean, you watched the video, I was trying, I actually recorded the fan noises.
[25:23.440 --> 25:24.560]  That wasn't fake.
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.480]  That wasn't like, we're going to just go find some fan noise on the internet, sound effects.
[25:28.480 --> 25:33.280]  I recorded that and when it finally went off, when the fan on the Pro finally went off,
[25:33.280 --> 25:39.440]  I had to like scurry around to find my good mic, plug it in, start running to record it.
[25:39.440 --> 25:43.440]  I was like, thank God I got it, and it stayed for long enough.
[25:43.440 --> 25:49.200]  But actually, the fan noise itself is quite quiet on the Pro compared to the Intel systems.
[25:51.040 --> 25:53.120]  Bottom line is I tried really hard, John.
[25:53.120 --> 25:55.680]  It is so quiet compared to the Intel systems.
[25:55.680 --> 26:01.520]  And I even mentioned it in my review, to set up my M1 MacBook Pro,
[26:01.520 --> 26:08.880]  I used Migration Assistant to move over a setup that I had on a 16-inch MacBook Pro from just last year.
[26:08.880 --> 26:14.880]  It's still a review unit that I had here waiting for this to compare head to head before I send it back.
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.360]  And just running Migration Assistant on the 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[26:21.360 --> 26:27.680]  which I think is like a $3,600 configuration, maybe closer to $4,000.
[26:27.680 --> 26:36.160]  I mean, it's got gobs of RAM and a huge SSD, and it's the Intel with the most cores on a MacBook Pro.
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.200]  Just running Migration Assistant, the fans go on on the 16-inch MacBook Pro,
[26:41.200 --> 26:44.400]  and they're not on the other thing, and they're so loud.
[26:44.400 --> 26:49.600]  And when you're running Migration Assistant, everything else quits.
[26:49.600 --> 26:55.680]  It's almost like putting the Mac, it actually is putting it into a special mode just for Migration Assistant.
[26:55.680 --> 27:02.240]  So it's not like, oh, well, Migration Assistant's running, but you've also got a bunch of Safari tabs or whatever.
[27:02.240 --> 27:04.000]  No, no, everything else quits.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.960]  And it's just Migration Assistant from this machine to Migration Assistant on this machine.
[27:08.960 --> 27:15.360]  And the 16-inch MacBook Pro is like a hairdryer, and the other one is dead silent.
[27:15.360 --> 27:17.440]  And it's like, oh, this is going to be interesting.
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.880]  I know it so well.
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.200]  Like, I work on that system, I've honestly worked on that for a lot of quarantine,
[27:23.200 --> 27:27.440]  just because the bigger screen, and I can be on the couch and have a 16-inch screen,
[27:27.440 --> 27:30.960]  and do work and come back to my desk and dock and have just so much screen.
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.000]  And I love that machine hardware-wise.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.640]  But the fan and the heat on that, if I'm cold, I can physically warm my whole body with the top of that keyboard.
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.440]  You just rub your whole body on top of that keyboard, and you can warm yourself.
[27:48.080 --> 27:50.480]  I don't know why they don't sell it as an actual space heater.
[27:50.480 --> 27:56.400]  So I think by the letter of the NDA, you're not supposed to talk,
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.560]  you're allowed to talk to the people you work with and the people in your family about the
[28:00.560 --> 28:02.480]  review unit before the embargo.
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.840]  But there's a circle of us who know each other.
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.560]  And I knew Matthew Panzorino was going to have some.
[28:08.560 --> 28:09.840]  I knew Jason Snell.
[28:10.400 --> 28:11.440]  I knew you would have some.
[28:12.480 --> 28:13.920]  And so we commit a little.
[28:13.920 --> 28:20.800]  I mean, it's not a cutthroat business reviewing these things.
[28:20.800 --> 28:22.480]  We're not trying to undercut each other.
[28:22.480 --> 28:24.160]  You know, it's not like we're being super secret.
[28:24.160 --> 28:25.920]  Speak for yourself, John.
[28:25.920 --> 28:26.560]  Yes, I know.
[28:26.560 --> 28:27.440]  I'm talking to you.
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.280]  Please, please.
[28:32.560 --> 28:34.000]  But I really did.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  I got to the point where I was running out of time.
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.520]  And I was like, this is amazing.
[28:41.520 --> 28:44.160]  This MacBook Pro, it has a fan.
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.000]  Everybody is thinking, well, they made such a big deal that the air has no fan, that it
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.680]  must mean that this one has a fan.
[28:51.680 --> 28:56.160]  And it's sort of like MacBook Pros that you know from the past in terms of coming on and
[28:56.160 --> 28:58.880]  making noise and getting hot.
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.280]  And hey, if you want a machine to run silently, you should get the air.
[29:03.280 --> 29:07.680]  And I'm like, this is amazing because you can get this MacBook Pro and you can trust
[29:07.680 --> 29:11.360]  it to run silently because I've never heard this thing come on.
[29:11.360 --> 29:12.560]  I don't feel any air blowing.
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.520]  And then I was like, this would be a big angle of my review.
[29:15.520 --> 29:18.240]  And then all of a sudden, I just thought popped into my head.
[29:18.240 --> 29:21.200]  What if I got a lemon and the fan just doesn't work?
[29:21.920 --> 29:28.560]  I don't want to make a jerk of myself and write 2000 words in this review about how
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.080]  the fan never comes on.
[29:30.080 --> 29:34.560]  And so I started reaching out to people and I'm like, hey, do you have the MacBook Pro?
[29:34.560 --> 29:35.120]  And they're like, yeah.
[29:35.120 --> 29:36.480]  And I'm like, does the fan ever come on?
[29:36.480 --> 29:37.440]  And they're like, no.
[29:37.440 --> 29:38.880]  Or it's like almost never.
[29:38.880 --> 29:40.320]  And I'm like, oh, thank God.
[29:40.320 --> 29:45.360]  I will admit, I mean, maybe I shouldn't admit it here.
[29:45.360 --> 29:46.240]  People listen.
[29:46.240 --> 29:48.320]  People, eh, it's fine.
[29:48.320 --> 29:50.320]  I did the same with Nilay Patel.
[29:50.320 --> 29:53.360]  I was like, I can't get the fan to go off.
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.200]  Like, what is going on?
[29:55.200 --> 29:57.840]  And at that point, I decided to do this whole video on it.
[29:57.840 --> 30:02.480]  And I was like, I can't have this be like at the end of this video, I didn't get it
[30:02.480 --> 30:04.000]  to turn on, right?
[30:05.200 --> 30:07.280]  He did tip me to one benchmark.
[30:07.280 --> 30:11.200]  But then finally, actually, when I decided, I was like, I'm going to try Premiere.
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.240]  Premiere, if you're doing a long enough export, that will do it.
[30:16.240 --> 30:19.760]  The issue was when I was testing, I was just doing like, I was exporting three to four
[30:19.760 --> 30:20.400]  minute videos.
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.560]  And that wasn't long enough for the system to go like in overdrive or to be exporting
[30:24.560 --> 30:25.760]  for that long.
[30:25.760 --> 30:29.360]  So I finally got it through Premiere and running a bunch of Chrome tabs in the background.
[30:29.360 --> 30:35.040]  But that like the Chrome test, when that first, when I did that myself, I was like truly
[30:35.040 --> 30:37.760]  freaking out by myself here in my office.
[30:38.560 --> 30:39.760]  This is kind of the sad thing.
[30:39.760 --> 30:41.520]  I mean, I know you always sort of work alone.
[30:41.520 --> 30:46.240]  But like, I just wanted somebody to like hug, you know?
[30:46.240 --> 30:51.280]  Like, I was like, there's 100 tabs open in Chrome.
[30:51.280 --> 30:53.440]  I can move around in each of them.
[30:53.440 --> 30:56.320]  I'm writing in Docs at normal speed.
[30:56.320 --> 30:58.160]  Everything is just working.
[30:58.160 --> 31:00.960]  Like, is this a miracle of God?
[31:00.960 --> 31:03.520]  And like, no, I had no one to share it with.
[31:03.520 --> 31:04.800]  And no beach ball, right?
[31:04.800 --> 31:09.280]  Because that's the thing with the older systems is if you have a bunch of tabs, sure, you
[31:09.280 --> 31:12.320]  could switch between these, you know, one, two, and three, one, two, and three.
[31:12.320 --> 31:14.320]  And it all just works even though you have them all open.
[31:14.320 --> 31:18.640]  But then you go to like tab 47, which hasn't been used in a while.
[31:18.640 --> 31:21.040]  And that's the one that's been swapped out to disk.
[31:21.040 --> 31:22.160]  And then they have to bring it back.
[31:22.160 --> 31:23.360]  The system has to bring it back.
[31:23.360 --> 31:26.880]  And you get the beach ball or it just pauses and you're waiting.
[31:26.880 --> 31:27.360]  And you're like, wait.
[31:27.360 --> 31:30.320]  Or you're trying to scroll and this page won't scroll.
[31:31.040 --> 31:32.640]  And it just takes you out of your flow.
[31:32.640 --> 31:34.480]  You're out of your flow and you're like, oh.
[31:34.480 --> 31:37.360]  And then, you know, especially for me with browser tabs, you never know.
[31:37.360 --> 31:39.680]  Is it like, wait, is the whole thing going to reload?
[31:39.680 --> 31:40.480]  Did something happen?
[31:40.480 --> 31:41.680]  And then it catches up.
[31:41.680 --> 31:42.640]  You're like, oh, there it is.
[31:42.640 --> 31:44.560]  But now your flow's broken.
[31:44.560 --> 31:46.320]  That never happened with the system.
[31:46.320 --> 31:52.720]  It's like, and I know even though my test machine had 16 gigs of RAM, not eight, I was
[31:52.720 --> 31:57.920]  looking at it in activity monitor and I was just opening goofy stuff in the background.
[31:57.920 --> 32:03.440]  Like, oh, I'll just leave a big photograph open in Pixelmator Pro in the background so
[32:03.440 --> 32:08.160]  that I know it's using, you know, a bunch of RAM just so that it's being used.
[32:08.160 --> 32:13.680]  And I can get the system to use more than 16 gigs of RAM and then start switching tabs
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.160]  and see if I, like, I could never tell.
[32:16.800 --> 32:18.320]  Yeah, I did the same thing.
[32:18.320 --> 32:19.040]  I did the same thing.
[32:19.040 --> 32:24.080]  And it's funny because this summer I did this piece on Chrome and Chrome versus Safari and
[32:24.080 --> 32:24.960]  Microsoft Edge.
[32:24.960 --> 32:28.160]  Honestly, it was a big part of the piece.
[32:28.160 --> 32:33.120]  And this was all brought on because over, you know, quarantine, working on my systems
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.280]  more than I ever had before, the fan was going crazy.
[32:37.280 --> 32:42.000]  It was always going crazy and that in a combination with Google Meet, which is another issue with
[32:42.000 --> 32:48.800]  RAM and especially working in other browsers other than Chrome, is just a disaster of eating
[32:48.800 --> 32:50.640]  cram, uh, cram, RAM.
[32:50.640 --> 32:52.240]  And it's a new thing I made, cram.
[32:52.240 --> 32:55.600]  Um, but honestly, Chrome eats, it's, it's cram.
[32:55.600 --> 32:56.880]  Is it Chrome?
[32:56.880 --> 32:59.040]  You have to buy, you have to buy cram for Chrome.
[32:59.040 --> 33:00.240]  Yeah, that'd be good.
[33:00.240 --> 33:04.640]  And I did this video during the summer of this Chrome, I animated this guy who was eating
[33:04.640 --> 33:07.360]  a Chrome guy or I didn't, but I hired an animator to do it.
[33:07.360 --> 33:12.000]  I was like, I want you to make Chrome eat all the parts of the food in the, in the computer
[33:12.000 --> 33:12.960]  because that's what it does.
[33:13.680 --> 33:18.080]  And in this piece, like I basically was like, Chrome is unusable on Macs.
[33:18.080 --> 33:22.800]  We need to all stop using Chrome, um, and we should do that for privacy reasons too.
[33:22.800 --> 33:28.400]  I made that argument, but like it is just devouring the RAM and Safari, brand new Safari
[33:28.400 --> 33:31.120]  on a big Sur is amazing and it works really well.
[33:31.120 --> 33:32.640]  And they've got the favicons.
[33:32.640 --> 33:34.240]  We could talk about that, Gruber.
[33:34.240 --> 33:36.080]  We can, we can talk about how you won that fight.
[33:36.080 --> 33:39.120]  Oh, I should just retire after that one.
[33:39.120 --> 33:39.920]  You really should have.
[33:39.920 --> 33:40.160]  Yeah.
[33:40.160 --> 33:41.280]  Just like me with the keyboards.
[33:41.280 --> 33:41.440]  Yeah.
[33:41.440 --> 33:44.080]  It's like, why do I keep working honestly?
[33:44.080 --> 33:49.760]  Um, but now it's a comp it's a horse of a different color, like, and they've released
[33:49.760 --> 33:56.880]  the, you know, Google's released an M1 Intel, a non Intel optimized version.
[33:57.600 --> 34:02.880]  And I kind of want to go back to Chrome, but I made a big thing about how I wasn't.
[34:02.880 --> 34:08.320]  Um, I'm also obsessed with edge, um, for a different reason, but yeah, the edge collections
[34:08.320 --> 34:11.120]  is, is, is amazing feature for a browser.
[34:11.120 --> 34:16.800]  I was kind of glad that the Chrome update to run natively on the M1 didn't come out
[34:16.800 --> 34:19.840]  until yesterday, which was a couple of days after the reviews.
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.800]  So that while I was writing my review, I could open a bunch of stuff in Chrome and know that
[34:24.800 --> 34:28.800]  it was running through Rosetta because I was like, well, this should be a good test.
[34:28.800 --> 34:33.200]  And I know that it's a good test that's applicable to lots of people because Chrome
[34:33.200 --> 34:34.560]  is the thing lots of people use.
[34:35.200 --> 34:40.560]  And I figured, you know, not that Chrome in particular would be a good longterm test.
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.680]  Cause I, without even asking anybody or looking on the chromium message boards, it was like,
[34:45.680 --> 34:50.160]  there's no way they're not going to have a native version out within weeks at the latest,
[34:50.160 --> 34:50.660]  you know?
[34:51.200 --> 34:55.360]  Um, but just, you know, it has a test of Rosetta and it was like, I can't even tell.
[34:55.360 --> 34:56.560]  I really can't.
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.880]  I was like, that's the other, you know, the other like miracle in this to me is, and,
[35:02.880 --> 35:08.400]  and I'll admit, you know, before anybody digs it up, like when it was like the cusp of WWDC
[35:08.400 --> 35:13.040]  this year at my last minute predictions, it was like, everybody kind of knew that they
[35:13.040 --> 35:14.800]  were going to announce this transition.
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.280]  Um, but nobody really knew what the details were going to be.
[35:19.280 --> 35:23.680]  And I made the prediction that maybe they wouldn't have any emulation for old Intel
[35:23.680 --> 35:29.680]  software because it would be so much easier for, you know, compared to a decade ago or
[35:29.680 --> 35:34.000]  two decades ago transitions, developers should be ready for this to just recompile.
[35:34.000 --> 35:40.080]  Um, not only was I wrong that they, I said, I don't think they're going to have emulation.
[35:40.080 --> 35:40.580]  They do.
[35:41.280 --> 35:43.200]  Um, it is amazing.
[35:43.200 --> 35:45.120]  It is just, it, it is the best.
[35:45.120 --> 35:50.800]  And I went through the transition in the nineties with the Mac going from the Motorola 68,000
[35:50.800 --> 35:52.160]  series to power PC.
[35:52.160 --> 35:55.040]  And I was here for the power PC to Intel.
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.960]  This is the, uh, just absolutely flabbergasting how you just don't know.
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.040]  You really have, you can just recommend these machines to normal people.
[36:05.040 --> 36:07.120]  And if they say, do I have to update all my software?
[36:07.120 --> 36:09.120]  And it's like, yeah, just do whatever you normally do.
[36:09.120 --> 36:10.400]  You know, you'll be fine.
[36:10.400 --> 36:14.720]  And that was my biggest like question mark, you know, whether it was the summer after
[36:14.720 --> 36:19.520]  WWDC or even after the announcement a couple of weeks ago, I just, you know, it was very
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.720]  careful with readers to say I would not pre-order just yet.
[36:22.720 --> 36:24.400]  Let's see what happens with the software.
[36:24.400 --> 36:31.600]  I had giant concerns about it, not only because of the Mac history, but back then I was a
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.400]  Windows fan and still like Windows in many shapes and forms.
[36:37.200 --> 36:42.400]  But, you know, having seen the Windows RT disaster, I was just like, there's, you know,
[36:42.400 --> 36:47.840]  this is not an easy thing to do and it definitely can have big consumer impact.
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.560]  And people who depend on certain apps, you know, my readers, they love Quicken.
[36:52.560 --> 36:56.560]  You know, you got it, you want a Quicken fan, you read the Wall Street Journal.
[36:56.560 --> 37:02.480]  And like, you know, I had no issues.
[37:02.480 --> 37:06.720]  I mean, there's nothing that doesn't work on here, even with just to prep for this podcast,
[37:06.720 --> 37:09.040]  because I'm now using the pro and I had done a lot of testing on the air.
[37:09.040 --> 37:11.600]  I needed to download like five things really quickly.
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.480]  You know, Skype, Audacity, all these things.
[37:14.480 --> 37:15.760]  And I was like, oh, just grab them all.
[37:15.760 --> 37:17.920]  And they all it's just like, yeah, no problem.
[37:17.920 --> 37:20.960]  Yeah, it's really impressive technologically.
[37:20.960 --> 37:24.800]  And again, not getting into the details, just the fan doesn't come on.
[37:24.800 --> 37:25.680]  I was so relieved.
[37:25.680 --> 37:30.560]  Again, I cannot emphasize the moment of panic I had that maybe I got a bum machine.
[37:31.120 --> 37:39.440]  Years ago, my first, the original Apple Watch, the review unit I got, the Taptic Engine broke
[37:40.400 --> 37:42.080]  and it broke very quickly.
[37:42.080 --> 37:43.360]  I clearly had a lemon.
[37:43.360 --> 37:44.800]  It was like I tried it on.
[37:44.800 --> 37:51.520]  And immediately I was like, wow, these taps for the thing do not feel like they did months ago
[37:51.520 --> 37:52.800]  when I was at the event.
[37:52.800 --> 37:59.200]  And we had, you remember the first Apple Watch came out, you know, a long time after the event.
[37:59.200 --> 38:00.880]  I was like, that's not how I remember it all.
[38:00.880 --> 38:02.160]  I can barely feel this.
[38:02.160 --> 38:06.000]  And then with like 10 minutes later, it, I didn't get any taps at all.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.800]  And I'm like, shouldn't I be getting a tap for this?
[38:08.800 --> 38:10.560]  It's like, I'm not getting taps for alerts.
[38:10.560 --> 38:13.280]  I'm not getting and I like contacted Apple.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.040]  And they were like, oh, that sounds like a bad unit.
[38:15.040 --> 38:16.560]  Let us replace it.
[38:16.560 --> 38:21.920]  And they like sent somebody down from New York with a unit the same day, like hours later.
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.360]  And it was the exact, you know, looked like the exact same thing and it had none of the problems.
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.360]  So I was like, oh, and they were like, yeah, give us that one.
[38:27.360 --> 38:28.000]  We'll take a look.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.760]  You know, it was clearly a bad unit.
[38:30.640 --> 38:32.800]  I love how you think that they sent that guy from New York.
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.960]  Like he's actually just been waiting outside your house.
[38:34.960 --> 38:35.460]  I know.
[38:36.320 --> 38:37.920]  They said he was waiting out.
[38:37.920 --> 38:39.440]  Yeah, he's still waiting out there.
[38:40.480 --> 38:42.320]  You know, but it happens, you know.
[38:42.320 --> 38:47.040]  And it, you know, in terms, you know, they really do send reviewers the actual unit.
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.000]  You know, if anybody, you know, to me, it was like confirmation that they're not like
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.640]  special, like, hey, we're going to pre-test all these units before we give them to reviewers.
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.240]  You know, they're sealed up just like consumer units and they give them to you.
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.040]  And I just thought, oh my God, what if I got the M1 MacBook Pro with a broken fan?
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.360]  And it mostly works because clearly the air is supposed to work without a fan.
[39:07.360 --> 39:08.160]  So it works.
[39:08.160 --> 39:09.200]  But right.
[39:09.200 --> 39:11.840]  But you're not getting like the performance leap.
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.600]  Yeah, it's just not getting there.
[39:13.600 --> 39:14.080]  Yeah.
[39:14.080 --> 39:15.200]  And I'm like, I don't know.
[39:15.200 --> 39:16.320]  I got to check with somebody.
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.960]  And everybody was like, no, it's either A, like me, they couldn't get it to come on or
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.720]  B, like you, they could get it to come on.
[39:22.720 --> 39:25.760]  But like the most dire circumstances, you know.
[39:25.760 --> 39:26.880]  And Premiere is a good test.
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.600]  I know Jason said that video export was one way he got it to come on.
[39:32.160 --> 39:36.160]  And not to throw Premiere under the bus, but Premiere, because it's cross-platform,
[39:36.720 --> 39:41.600]  isn't necessarily optimized like the way Final Cut Pro is specifically for Apple stuff.
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.160]  And to channel stuff through the special chips, it's going through the CPU to export
[39:46.160 --> 39:46.560]  video.
[39:46.560 --> 39:47.760]  So it's going to heat it up.
[39:49.360 --> 39:54.080]  You know, it's like a stress test of the CPU in a way that maybe Final Cut Pro isn't for
[39:54.080 --> 39:56.240]  the same export task.
[39:56.240 --> 40:01.520]  Yeah, I think at this point, it's got to be a mix of the GPU and CPU really being hammered
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.240]  for it to come on because gaming can do it too for longer periods of time.
[40:06.240 --> 40:12.240]  The Cinebench test, which also is a GPU test, I think it's a combo of that.
[40:12.240 --> 40:18.560]  Because I did, video calling is another place where the fans are always coming on, on the
[40:18.560 --> 40:20.720]  Intel system, especially in Google Meet.
[40:20.720 --> 40:21.840]  Which is horrible, right?
[40:21.840 --> 40:22.720]  Horrible.
[40:22.720 --> 40:25.520]  I mean, and that's what's so relatable about this right now.
[40:25.520 --> 40:28.240]  Like the timing could not be better for this machine.
[40:29.200 --> 40:32.160]  Like, you know, in my video, I had it taking off for outer space.
[40:32.160 --> 40:37.920]  And the Intel version, because it is a constant joke in our company, like, people will be
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.360]  like, is it normal that like, they'll text me like, is it normal that fans and I'm like,
[40:41.360 --> 40:44.560]  yeah, yeah, it's normal, like your computer's going to take off for outer space, it's fine.
[40:44.560 --> 40:46.720]  It's always like a like a little fun joke about it.
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.400]  But everyone knows it now because we're in Zoom or Google Meet all day.
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.560]  And with this, that was a huge turning point in my review.
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.960]  I've been working on a long video, a 30 minute short documentary, and we did a viewing of
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.240]  it last week in Google Meet, because it was the best platform for this external editor
[41:06.240 --> 41:06.880]  I have.
[41:06.880 --> 41:10.880]  And we watched this video for 30 minutes through Google Meet.
[41:10.880 --> 41:13.440]  It was a little bit choppy, just because of bandwidth.
[41:13.440 --> 41:15.360]  The three of us all running their video.
[41:16.240 --> 41:18.800]  The computer was completely cool.
[41:19.600 --> 41:21.440]  And I had other things going on in the background.
[41:21.440 --> 41:22.320]  This was the air.
[41:22.320 --> 41:22.820]  Right.
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.720]  And then I also was like, okay, I actually want to switch to the Pro.
[41:26.720 --> 41:29.360]  And we did it the next day again, just for like a mild test.
[41:29.360 --> 41:36.960]  But into the full 30 minute run of the video, still nothing like the 16 inch MacBook Pro,
[41:36.960 --> 41:39.120]  the Intel version would be sweltering.
[41:39.120 --> 41:39.620]  Right.
[41:39.620 --> 41:40.320]  If I did that.
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.400]  And noisy, right?
[41:42.400 --> 41:43.680]  It's so noisy.
[41:43.680 --> 41:44.160]  Right?
[41:44.160 --> 41:44.640]  Yeah.
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.080]  It's an assault on two senses.
[41:46.720 --> 41:47.440]  It really is.
[41:48.400 --> 41:48.900]  Yeah.
[41:49.200 --> 41:57.600]  And it is true that timing wise, you know, with everybody professionally dependent on
[41:57.600 --> 42:02.800]  video conferencing, it really has elevated video conferencing to the level of I mean,
[42:02.800 --> 42:07.040]  what were like the old standbys of well, what are the things everybody does on a computer,
[42:07.040 --> 42:12.800]  email, web, productivity apps, chat.
[42:12.800 --> 42:15.760]  You always need a Microsoft Word test, you know, everyone's running.
[42:15.760 --> 42:16.560]  I mean, not anymore.
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.240]  But you know, what it used to be, it used to be for me when I was reviewing laptops.
[42:20.240 --> 42:24.000]  Right, open up a big Word document or open up a big spreadsheet or something like that
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.240]  and, you know, resort the columns.
[42:26.240 --> 42:31.840]  You know, and web browsing is clearly the one that is the most, you know, everybody
[42:31.840 --> 42:34.880]  who doesn't use the web, so you can run tests and stuff like that.
[42:34.880 --> 42:39.280]  But now video conferencing has to be part of that discussion of, well, this is just
[42:39.280 --> 42:42.720]  table stakes for what people do on their laptops.
[42:42.720 --> 42:47.120]  And, oh, yeah, it doesn't really matter which platform you're using, if it's Zoom or Skype
[42:47.120 --> 42:48.960]  or Google Meet or whatever.
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.200]  Yeah, it's going to sound like a hairdryer going on and it's going to get real hot.
[42:53.200 --> 42:54.160]  Mm hmm.
[42:54.160 --> 42:56.320]  And that's just the way it is.
[42:56.320 --> 43:01.520]  And it's like now it's like, no, and it's like part of and what's cool about it is like,
[43:01.520 --> 43:08.640]  okay, so like Google Meet is clearly it's not like they optimized it for the M1, right?
[43:08.640 --> 43:14.160]  It's not, oh, well, it's FaceTime, you know, and then Apple got to optimize it and do whatever
[43:14.160 --> 43:15.440]  they could to take advantage of it.
[43:15.440 --> 43:18.640]  It's just Google Meet doing whatever they were doing before, but now it's running on
[43:18.640 --> 43:21.840]  this new system and it just doesn't get hot.
[43:21.840 --> 43:23.040]  Yeah.
[43:23.040 --> 43:27.920]  Yeah, it was I mean, that call last week, I was like, I kept interrupting.
[43:27.920 --> 43:30.960]  I was like, I just have to say my computer's totally fine.
[43:30.960 --> 43:31.840]  It's amazing.
[43:31.840 --> 43:33.920]  And they're like, okay, we're in the middle of watching the cut.
[43:33.920 --> 43:35.440]  I'm like, okay, fine.
[43:35.440 --> 43:40.400]  But and the other thing, too, that sort of self-referential about it is like, you know,
[43:40.400 --> 43:47.440]  I wrote a long review and it's it's just so much more physically pleasant writing and
[43:47.440 --> 43:51.440]  you're in a long typing session and I'm in the flow, the words are coming out.
[43:51.440 --> 43:53.120]  It's like, don't interrupt me.
[43:53.120 --> 43:54.000]  Here I go.
[43:54.000 --> 44:00.960]  And it's so nice when the palm rests are nice, cool aluminum as opposed to, you know, making
[44:00.960 --> 44:03.040]  your palms sweat aluminum.
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.280]  And it's like that is it.
[44:06.240 --> 44:07.200]  You can't measure.
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.120]  It doesn't show up in a Geekbench benchmark, but it's so much nicer.
[44:11.120 --> 44:12.080]  This is the way it should be.
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.680]  And add in the battery life.
[44:15.680 --> 44:18.640]  And it's just like, yeah, right on all levels.
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.600]  And you said that on CNBC, I feel like which was really just such a good point.
[44:23.600 --> 44:30.080]  I mean, just all around the updates here are so significant and just such a big leap from
[44:30.080 --> 44:32.800]  what we've seen in laptops in 10 years.
[44:32.800 --> 44:39.920]  I really think that that to me is the takeaway for the consumer audience mass market should
[44:39.920 --> 44:40.880]  you get this.
[44:40.880 --> 44:49.680]  And it's like, if you were going to get a 13 inch laptop and you, you know, all right,
[44:49.680 --> 44:51.520]  there are people who need four ports.
[44:51.520 --> 44:52.880]  We can get into that in a bit.
[44:52.880 --> 44:59.840]  But if you were just going to get like a roughly, you know, $1,200 ish, 13 inch, and you should
[44:59.840 --> 45:01.920]  get this one because it is the bat.
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.720]  It runs cool, run silent, and the battery lasts noticeably longer.
[45:06.720 --> 45:11.680]  Like not like, oh, every year the iPhone gets a little better and, you know, it goes from
[45:11.680 --> 45:15.680]  10 hours of whatever the audio playback to 11 hours.
[45:15.680 --> 45:16.560]  And it's like, oh, that's cool.
[45:16.560 --> 45:18.160]  That's 10% year over year.
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.640]  Like this is like twice as much or one and a half of maybe with the air or something
[45:22.640 --> 45:22.960]  like that.
[45:22.960 --> 45:28.560]  But it really is the difference between plugging in overnight.
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.560]  And if your spot where you're working at home probably right now isn't near a power outlet,
[45:34.560 --> 45:35.280]  don't worry about it.
[45:35.280 --> 45:35.840]  Just sit there.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.200]  You can work all day long.
[45:37.200 --> 45:39.200]  You don't have to turn the brightness down on your screen.
[45:39.200 --> 45:42.240]  You don't have to worry about quitting background apps or anything like that.
[45:42.240 --> 45:42.880]  Just use it.
[45:42.880 --> 45:45.280]  And it'll easily last all day long.
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.480]  Yeah, yesterday, actually, I went to the office to finish recording some stuff in our studio.
[45:53.040 --> 45:58.880]  And I left home and I was like, I'm not bringing the charger, even though like I knew I could
[45:58.880 --> 46:00.640]  find a charger at the office.
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.120]  But like I was like, I'm just it.
[46:03.120 --> 46:03.760]  I can do it.
[46:03.760 --> 46:06.400]  I can make it the entire day and actually left it like 7 a.m.
[46:06.400 --> 46:08.160]  and didn't come home till 7 p.m.
[46:08.720 --> 46:11.280]  I probably still had 40% battery.
[46:12.320 --> 46:14.720]  And I was on the computer all day at the office.
[46:14.720 --> 46:18.800]  I thought that the one that really made like I had to double check.
[46:18.800 --> 46:20.320]  Like I pinged him.
[46:20.320 --> 46:22.000]  I was like, let me make sure I'm reading this right.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.200]  I was reading Panzarino's review, and he had the bright idea of downloading the WebKit
[46:27.200 --> 46:31.280]  open source project and compiling it from scratch.
[46:31.280 --> 46:35.840]  And it's a huge project, takes an incredibly long amount of time, like over an hour.
[46:37.840 --> 46:46.320]  And the M1 was like competing very admirably on time with like iMac Pro and the Mac Pro,
[46:46.320 --> 46:49.200]  you know, $1,000 desktop workstations.
[46:49.200 --> 46:55.760]  It was beating the 16-inch MacBook Pro at compile speeds, which is great if you're a
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.480]  developer and developers know that waiting for the compiler is just a huge, you know,
[47:00.480 --> 47:02.800]  huge waste of time and it takes you out of your flow.
[47:05.440 --> 47:12.880]  But the biggest difference was starting at 100%, the MacBook, the M1 MacBook Pro compiled
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.800]  the whole thing, and when it was done, it had 91% battery life left.
[47:16.800 --> 47:23.040]  When the Intel 13-inch MacBook Pro, not 16-inch, but 13-inch, but with, you know, head-to-head
[47:23.040 --> 47:26.320]  comparison, it only had 24% battery life left.
[47:26.320 --> 47:31.200]  It used 76% of the battery life to do what the M1 did in 9%.
[47:32.480 --> 47:37.280]  So even if the times were the same, which they weren't, the M1 was faster.
[47:37.280 --> 47:38.560]  That's insane.
[47:38.560 --> 47:44.320]  Like 24% battery life means you've got to start looking for a charger right now.
[47:44.320 --> 47:48.960]  And 91% is like, well, why even, you know, rounds up to 100.
[47:49.680 --> 47:50.480]  That's insane.
[47:51.680 --> 47:53.600]  I mean, and it all adds up.
[47:53.600 --> 47:59.520]  I mean, that system was probably super hot and like, I don't know, chugging along to
[47:59.520 --> 48:00.560]  do whatever it had to do.
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.200]  It used all of its energy to do that versus the M1 that just, it's like, okay, I'll just
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.120]  sit around and do it and I'll use half the energy and I won't, I'll just be cool.
[48:09.120 --> 48:14.080]  And that to me is just a huge reason to buy it, even if you don't really understand and
[48:14.080 --> 48:19.040]  don't want to understand any technical aspect of what it means to go from Intel Silicon
[48:19.040 --> 48:20.000]  to Apple Silicon.
[48:20.000 --> 48:20.560]  Totally.
[48:20.560 --> 48:23.840]  Battery life lasts longer, runs cool, runs faster.
[48:23.840 --> 48:24.640]  There you go.
[48:24.640 --> 48:26.800]  And the compatibility, you don't have to worry about compatibility.
[48:26.800 --> 48:27.200]  There you go.
[48:27.200 --> 48:28.080]  The whole story is over.
[48:28.640 --> 48:29.920]  It's, you know.
[48:29.920 --> 48:33.120]  But yeah, like we've spent how many minutes talking about it now and all, it's all I've
[48:33.120 --> 48:33.920]  thought about all week.
[48:33.920 --> 48:44.800]  But anything for me, like there was, I had, I really loved the Air, maybe now it's like
[48:44.800 --> 48:45.600]  eight years ago.
[48:46.960 --> 48:48.480]  It was like a thing, right?
[48:48.480 --> 48:52.960]  The 2011, I think was the one that everybody, it was like the high watermark.
[48:53.600 --> 48:54.000]  Yeah.
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.960]  And, and I was working at the Verge then and I even tweeted it today because Dieter Bone
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.480]  cited it in his newsletter, but I was a Windows laptop reviewer at the time.
[49:04.480 --> 49:06.720]  I mean, really that was my, was my job.
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.040]  And I, well, I would say Windows, but I also had reviewed the Air of that year.
[49:11.040 --> 49:17.440]  And my long running thing was, but you know what, for $200 more than this Ultrabook from
[49:17.440 --> 49:23.120]  ASUS or from Dell or HP, like I reviewed them all, but everyone would basically say in every
[49:23.120 --> 49:26.800]  review, I would basically say, you know, for $200 more though, you can get this Air, this
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.760]  MacBook Air, which runs for, I think at the time it was like 12 hours, which was like
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.000]  double the amount of time the Windows systems could and has better performance.
[49:36.000 --> 49:36.880]  And guess what?
[49:36.880 --> 49:38.800]  You can even run Windows on it.
[49:38.800 --> 49:40.400]  And this was like the long thing.
[49:40.400 --> 49:44.960]  That year, I probably converted many people from Windows systems to the Air because the
[49:44.960 --> 49:46.480]  Air was just the best.
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.920]  And then like between that point and now, really, you know, Apple did a good job on
[49:51.920 --> 49:52.400]  the Air.
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.480]  It did the refresh three years ago with the horrible keyboard, which we don't have to
[49:56.480 --> 49:58.800]  get into right now, but it was fine, right?
[49:58.800 --> 50:00.080]  The battery was fine.
[50:00.080 --> 50:01.440]  The performance was fine.
[50:01.440 --> 50:02.480]  It definitely got hot.
[50:02.480 --> 50:06.400]  It got warm, but it was really no better than some of the Windows Ultrabooks.
[50:06.400 --> 50:12.640]  And honestly, Dell has been doing a great job on that Ultrabook, their XPS 13 for years.
[50:12.640 --> 50:16.880]  You know, I always was able to get probably like two hours more battery life out of the
[50:16.880 --> 50:19.520]  Dell than I was out of a Mac.
[50:20.800 --> 50:23.200]  And now it's just like night and days.
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.400]  Like this is the best laptop ever.
[50:26.400 --> 50:27.600]  Like, I mean, I said that in my piece.
[50:27.600 --> 50:29.840]  I was like, this is, these laptops are the best ever.
[50:29.840 --> 50:32.240]  And they're better than any Windows system you could buy.
[50:32.240 --> 50:33.440]  Trenton Larkin Yeah.
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.760]  And there's an aspect to this where, and I'm sort of stealing from my friend Ben Thompson
[50:39.760 --> 50:47.840]  here, but there's a way that the typical productivity has moved very largely to that.
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.000]  A lot of its stuff is just on the web and people are just doing their work in browser
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.240]  tabs, whatever browser they're using, but it's on the web and therefore they can switch
[50:56.240 --> 50:58.720]  to, you know, from Windows to Mac or something like that.
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.960]  And a lot of their stuff just works, right?
[51:00.960 --> 51:06.160]  If you do your Gmail in gmail.com, you go anywhere and get your email.
[51:06.160 --> 51:11.200]  Trenton Larkin And in some ways that works against Apple,
[51:11.200 --> 51:16.880]  because like, what's the point of getting a Mac if it's a minority platform?
[51:17.440 --> 51:22.000]  And the advantage historically has always been, well, if you really embrace the Mac
[51:22.000 --> 51:26.880]  ecosystem of Mac software and doing things the Mac way, it's great.
[51:26.880 --> 51:30.000]  These are great apps and they work well together.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.600]  And there's just, you know, there's just great advantages to it, but you kind of have
[51:35.600 --> 51:36.800]  to buy into this.
[51:36.800 --> 51:39.120]  And some people don't want to do that.
[51:39.120 --> 51:40.560]  Some people don't want to break their habits.
[51:40.560 --> 51:44.080]  And then a lot of people can't because they don't get to make those choices.
[51:44.080 --> 51:49.040]  They work at a place and their work says, well, we're going to use Google Docs and
[51:49.040 --> 51:50.480]  that's what we're using.
[51:50.480 --> 51:55.200]  And you're doing it, you know, you don't have a choice to use pages and numbers or
[51:55.200 --> 51:57.840]  something like that because it's in the Apple ecosystem.
[51:57.840 --> 51:58.800]  That's just the way it is.
[51:58.800 --> 52:05.280]  These machines are great for people in that boat because the runs cool, runs fast, and
[52:05.280 --> 52:07.360]  battery life is way longer.
[52:08.560 --> 52:09.920]  Yeah, sold, right?
[52:09.920 --> 52:15.520]  That is absolutely great, even if you're not really heavily or even at all into the
[52:15.520 --> 52:20.400]  Apple software ecosystem, which is a very unusual place for the Mac to be.
[52:21.680 --> 52:23.440]  And I think that's right.
[52:23.440 --> 52:28.880]  I think when you look at what does, and I've been thinking about it this week, what does
[52:28.880 --> 52:36.400]  Adele, as I said, like Adele, like the singer, what does Adele the singer do?
[52:36.400 --> 52:38.320]  What is she going to do about these Macs?
[52:38.320 --> 52:43.840]  Like, is she just going to keep selling what she's been selling?
[52:44.960 --> 52:52.800]  But really, I was just looking at the Dell XPS specs, same price as the Dell XPS.
[52:52.800 --> 52:59.200]  Same price, you get more storage, but it's just a no brainer to me.
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.280]  The battery life is going to be longer, these systems run cooler, they're faster.
[53:07.040 --> 53:08.800]  You buy the Dell if you need Windows.
[53:08.800 --> 53:12.160]  And of course, that's the big question mark right now is how's Windows going to run on
[53:12.160 --> 53:12.660]  this?
[53:14.240 --> 53:14.740]  It will.
[53:15.840 --> 53:18.240]  Yeah, but I wonder about that.
[53:18.240 --> 53:20.240]  But to your point, how important is it?
[53:20.240 --> 53:22.560]  Yeah, how important is it?
[53:22.560 --> 53:27.600]  Because if, you know, the old argument was, well, I'm not really into the Mac or not,
[53:27.600 --> 53:30.080]  my company is not in the Mac ecosystem at all.
[53:30.080 --> 53:31.840]  Therefore, we need to run Windows.
[53:32.480 --> 53:40.400]  Whereas, not with any one particular moment in history, but just general attrition over
[53:40.400 --> 53:49.600]  the last 10 years, stuff that of that general cross platform, big company sort of stuff
[53:49.600 --> 53:51.280]  has just moved to the web.
[53:51.280 --> 53:53.680]  And even Microsoft is part of that.
[53:53.680 --> 54:01.120]  Like to Satya Nadella's credit, they're no longer everything on Windows all the time.
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.600]  They've got a great cloud infrastructure business that powers this stuff for other companies,
[54:05.600 --> 54:12.880]  and they have all sorts of their own stuff that runs in browsers or is a cross platform
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.800]  app like Skype and stuff like that.
[54:15.920 --> 54:16.880]  So they're part of it, too.
[54:16.880 --> 54:20.160]  It's not like they've been left behind, but I just don't feel like people need to run
[54:20.160 --> 54:20.640]  Windows.
[54:20.640 --> 54:25.360]  And then even if they do, I mean, clearly gaming would be a reason, and it'd be interesting
[54:25.360 --> 54:26.240]  to see how that works.
[54:26.240 --> 54:34.320]  But Windows just isn't Windows on ARM just isn't a thing like the way that Apple made
[54:34.320 --> 54:38.000]  it possible where you don't even have to worry about it and everything just recompiles.
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.120]  Like I just don't know that that matters.
[54:43.120 --> 54:50.160]  And if they announce it and like, oh, finally, I can install Windows on this M1 MacBook and
[54:50.160 --> 54:53.840]  you do it, I don't know that it's going to make you happy in the way that you think it
[54:53.840 --> 54:59.520]  was because you may not have, oh, the games I want to play don't run on ARM anyway.
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.960]  Well, and I think you're bringing up the big part of this review, which wasn't so positive.
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.640]  And it's maybe just for now as apps start to make their way more into the App Store
[55:12.640 --> 55:16.000]  into the Mac App Store, iOS and iPad apps make their way into the App Store.
[55:16.960 --> 55:19.760]  But those are just not great to use right now.
[55:19.760 --> 55:24.640]  And that might be, again, well, there's two points to that.
[55:24.640 --> 55:27.440]  One, I didn't really care that much.
[55:27.440 --> 55:33.200]  Like it was a place to ding Apple and say, these apps don't resize here and you definitely
[55:33.200 --> 55:35.040]  want you want to have a touch screen.
[55:35.040 --> 55:38.080]  Oh, you're talking about the iPhone apps running on the Mac.
[55:38.080 --> 55:38.880]  Right, right.
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.720]  But I didn't, it wasn't something to dwell on, A, because the system was so good and
[55:44.720 --> 55:46.960]  made so many improvements in other places.
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.080]  But B, you have the web, as you mentioned.
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.160]  And actually, I reached out because I started doing a search, I just decided, okay, let
[55:54.160 --> 55:57.920]  me go through my popular iPhone, my iPhone apps and see if they're in the Mac App Store.
[55:57.920 --> 55:59.680]  And really, none of them were there.
[55:59.680 --> 56:03.200]  So I reached out to Instagram and Snapchat and TikTok.
[56:03.200 --> 56:07.360]  And all of them just said, oh, well, we have web apps, which, you know, feels like a little
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.200]  bit of a cop out of an answer to me.
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.920]  But it was true, I could just use all those things on the web, which is the argument you're
[56:13.920 --> 56:18.160]  making, which is, well, maybe the operating system doesn't fully matter so much.
[56:18.160 --> 56:19.440]  It's like the Chromebook argument.
[56:20.640 --> 56:24.800]  But also, then when I look at the apps that I really use on my Mac, they're all things
[56:24.800 --> 56:28.400]  I do use on my iPhone, which are the Apple native apps.
[56:29.200 --> 56:32.640]  So iMessage, which works so much better in Big Sur.
[56:32.640 --> 56:38.080]  Notes, Apple Music.
[56:38.080 --> 56:40.720]  I'm looking down across my toolbar right now.
[56:40.720 --> 56:41.840]  Those are my main ones.
[56:41.840 --> 56:42.400]  FaceTime.
[56:44.320 --> 56:44.800]  All those work.
[56:45.440 --> 56:46.480]  You don't use mail?
[56:46.480 --> 56:48.080]  You use like Gmail or something like that?
[56:48.080 --> 56:49.040]  I use Gmail, yeah.
[56:50.000 --> 56:51.040]  Let me take another break.
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.960]  And we'll come back because I feel like this is a new topic, the iOS app thing, because
[56:54.960 --> 56:55.600]  I want to rant.
[56:57.360 --> 57:00.240]  Let me tell you about, do you have anxiety?
[57:00.240 --> 57:05.440]  Does thinking about iOS apps, just thinking about a laptop running hot and loud stress
[57:05.440 --> 57:05.840]  you out?
[57:05.840 --> 57:07.920]  Well, we all have stress these days.
[57:07.920 --> 57:09.440]  Let me tell you about Feals.

[58:35.600 --> 58:36.480]  My thanks to Feals.
[58:37.760 --> 58:42.960]  I think this iPhone app thing is, maybe it'll become something eventually.
[58:42.960 --> 58:50.160]  Maybe it needed to ship in a weird rough early state just to get developers on board.
[58:50.160 --> 58:52.160]  But I don't know.
[58:52.160 --> 58:56.640]  It just, it feels very un-Apple-like to me to ship something that is so pointless.
[58:56.640 --> 59:00.640]  Well, that's sort of, I guess, what I was trying to make the point of.
[59:00.640 --> 59:02.480]  It's just like, does it matter?
[59:02.480 --> 59:05.120]  Does it even matter that some of these apps are there?
[59:05.120 --> 59:08.560]  What is the killer iPhone app that you want on your Mac?
[59:08.560 --> 59:09.040]  Right.
[59:09.040 --> 59:13.360]  And some people, and I've, you know, I mentioned this to people at Apple and like, well, my
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.680]  bank has an app and it's better than their website.
[59:16.480 --> 59:18.480]  And it's like, oh, all right, maybe.
[59:18.480 --> 59:18.880]  I don't know.
[59:18.880 --> 59:23.040]  But my bank has a website and if I'm on my computer, I'd rather just do it on the website.
[59:24.800 --> 59:25.440]  Right.
[59:25.440 --> 59:32.160]  It just doesn't occur to me on my Mac to open, you know, my bank names app.
[59:32.160 --> 59:33.360]  I would just go to the web.
[59:35.920 --> 59:38.080]  I see it for some like utilities, right?
[59:38.080 --> 59:42.480]  Like I kept thinking, like, I wouldn't mind having the Nest app because I'm constantly
[59:42.480 --> 59:44.720]  trying to adjust the thermometer in the basement.
[59:44.720 --> 59:52.000]  I also want to say that if you do hear a fan noise in this episode, I am running my space
[59:52.000 --> 59:54.080]  heater underneath my desk right now.
[59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.720]  My feet are very cold and I am constantly adjusting my thermometer upstairs or sorry,
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.680]  it's not thermometer.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.240]  It's my, what is the thing called?
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.360]  The thermostat.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:05.920]  Thermostat.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.320]  That's the, that's the third word, the thermostat.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.360]  So if you do hear it, it is not the computer.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.560]  It is the actual space heater under the desk.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.080]  The weather here in the Northeast has been crazy this week too.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.520]  Right now, my watch says it's 63 degrees outside, which is nice, but like two days ago, it was
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.360]  like 29 degrees here in Philadelphia.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.040]  It was freezing, literally freezing.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:29.840]  I know.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.600]  And that's why I turned the heat off this morning.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.000]  I was like, why are we running the heat at 60 degrees out?
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.360]  But now I'm freezing in the basement.
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.080]  We've been, we've been manning the thermostat like that nonstop because it's like, all of
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.160]  a sudden we're all freezing and we look and we're like, oh, the house is actually is freezing.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:44.880]  We're not nuts.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.080]  But anyway.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.640]  Anyway, good weather break.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.360]  Good weather break.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.400]  I could see that the, you know, we have a nest too, and the nest app is kind of nice,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.440]  you know, on the phone.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.640]  It really is like when you're sitting on the couch and it's like, you know, it does feel
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.200]  like when I was a kid, like I, I grew up in the era of when the TVs still didn't have
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.840]  remote controls and it was like the greatest thing ever.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.320]  We could switch the channel without getting up.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.840]  And now it's like, we can make the house warmer without getting up.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.720]  This is amazing.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.840]  Well, I did just launch what I think is the most impressive iPhone app that you can get
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.520]  on the Mac, the Dunkin Donuts app.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.840]  It's funny.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.360]  I had a line in my review, but it's true.
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.800]  Cause I started just doing a search of like, what apps can you get?
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:40.320]  I don't know what I typed in to the Mac app store, but it turns out every fast food app
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.560]  you can get on the Mac, like every single one of them is there.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.960]  Wendy's, Chick-fil-A, Dunkin Donuts, Burger King, Panda Express.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.880]  What can you do?
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.920]  Just preplace your order and then go pick it up?
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.960]  I guess so.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.880]  Cause I've used the Starbucks app for that.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.960]  I think Starbucks is there.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.440]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.960]  Oh no, I think Starbucks isn't there.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.480]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:12.720]  So the gist of how it works is if you're the developer of an iOS app that doesn't have
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:18.400]  a Mac app, just iPhone, maybe iPad, you know, nowadays, hopefully most of those apps support
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.120]  both because they're the same app and they just scale to the screen.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:28.640]  If you didn't do anything, then your app would be available in the Mac app store for Macs
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.960]  running on the M1.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.160]  And then you can search on the app store and for a name.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.480]  And by default, it still only shows real Mac apps, but then you can switch a little tab
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.120]  to say show iOS and iPad apps.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.760]  And then they'll show up there too, and you can download them.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.920]  But if you don't want your app to appear like that, you can opt out of it.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.960]  And that's what, you know, like you said, like Instagram opted out and TikTok and others.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.080]  There apparently is a trick though, where if you just download the app, I'm not even,
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.440]  I should know how to do this, but I've forgotten how without iTunes.
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:08.080]  Remember you used to be able to back up your apps to iTunes and you'd have a copy of the
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.240]  IPA files on your Mac.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.040]  If you just double click those or something on your M1, you can run them, even if they're
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.320]  not authorized to run.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.600]  It's, I don't know if it's, this is like, where do you get that from?
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.080]  I don't know.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.640]  I'll put a link in the show notes on how to do it, but you can, there's a trick you can
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:29.680]  get to get like Instagram to run on your M1 MacBook, but it's not meant for it, right?
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.440]  It doesn't, you know, there's things that are missing.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.360]  It doesn't work right.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.080]  I don't know why.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:39.920]  My favorite thing is that like all these fast food apps have verified.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.240]  Like just like search, search fast food.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.560]  Everyone who listens, when if you have an M1 Mac, just search fast food and you will
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.840]  just see, this is why they wanted to run iPhone apps on Mac, I think.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.080]  I wish that we could get our fast food apps.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.040]  Shake Shack.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.160]  Oh, that's a good one.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.040]  Yeah.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.760]  I don't want to start in the East coast, West coast argument with Shake Shack versus, what's
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:03.920]  that?
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.720]  No, not five guys.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.520]  That's East coast too.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.160]  In and out.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.200]  In and out is the one.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:07.700]  Let's see.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.880]  I bet it, I have it.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.120]  Yeah.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:11.760]  I don't know.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.160]  I don't.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.200]  But then that's weird.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.000]  You know, they, they sort of celebrate, they have in and out locator.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.400]  Yeah.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:16.900]  Yeah.
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.040]  You know, it's funny because Dunkin Donuts is all over the place, you know?
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:27.200]  I mean, not even talking about the Boston area where they're literally, I think it's
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.480]  like state law in Massachusetts where every 500 feet there has to be a Dunkin Donuts.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.360]  But you know, New York, Philadelphia, they're all over the place here.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.920]  But I was talking to a friend who's been in California for years and he's never had
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.200]  Dunkin Donuts coffee.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.960]  And I'm like, I'm not a huge Dunkin Donuts fan, but I like their coffee.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:52.880]  But the miracle of Dunkin Donuts coffee is 24 hours a day, seven days a week, if they're
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.400]  open, any Dunkin Donuts, anywhere you go, the coffee is exactly the same.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.440]  It is always true.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.200]  5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:09.440]  They, they, speaking of needing a fan, their coffee is always it hotter than you can possibly
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.560]  believe coffee get like, how is it not boiling?
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.160]  It should, you know what they should make?
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.280]  They should make an Intel.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.480]  They should make an Intel version of a Dunkin Donuts coffee.
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.120]  It's a new brand.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.360]  Like a, like, Oh, would you like your Intel, Intel hot?
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.080]  Yeah, but it always tastes the same and it always tastes pretty good.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:31.280]  And it also doesn't taste quite like anybody else's coffee.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.800]  It's very clearly I could Pepsi challenge it any day of the week.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:36.720]  And it's always good.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.600]  It's always Dunkin.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.000]  It's not the greatest, but it's just plain.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.840]  And you don't have to, when you order it, you don't have to order the light roast or
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.760]  the dark roast or that roast.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.840]  You just get coffee and it's great.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.000]  And I get the iced coffee there, so I don't know that much about the hot.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.440]  They have great iced coffee.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.760]  And again, I like that Dunkin Donuts iced coffee always tastes exactly the same.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:58.960]  I'm really happy.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.000]  It could be on the show to get you a Dunkin Donuts sponsorship after this.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:02.880]  I know they should.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:07.600]  It's, you know, I'm really, I'm really happy to have been here for this to help you get
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.000]  to them.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:13.760]  It's like the McDonald's French fries of, uh, of coffee, except sometimes you get like,
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.760]  you'll get cold McDonald's French fries, right?
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.640]  Like they didn't, they should have thrown them out and replaced them, but it's like
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.280]  Dunkin Donuts.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.640]  You're never going to get a cold coffee.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.000]  That's true.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.840]  Whenever I'm on like a road trip or whenever we drive upstate, I always am like, well,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.680]  just go to the Dunkin Donuts on the road because I know it will be reliable and good.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.120]  Yeah, it's always good.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.000]  And, and they have very sturdy cups, you know, and, uh, you know, it's all good.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.120]  Dunkin Donuts, very good.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.400]  They should expand to the West coast, move some of those Massachusetts ones up there.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.520]  Are we done with the sponsor break or are we back to this?
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.720]  Yeah, Dunkin didn't sponsor.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.440]  This is all free.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.280]  I just give away, give away good words to Dunkin Donuts.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.320]  I don't get it.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.440]  I don't get the thing.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.280]  But I do that where I wanted to, I knew I wanted to do the break and talk about this
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.800]  because I feel like we're, we would be people.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.000]  The next, uh, controversy would be if we did not have an argument about touch screens.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.840]  Oh yeah, we need to have that.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.880]  And it's related to the iPhone app thing, right?
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:16.560]  Because this is the people who want to see touch screens on Apple Mac books also are
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.120]  saying, well, wait, if you're going to let these phone apps run and the phone apps assume
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.400]  you have a touch screen, why wouldn't the Mac, why shouldn't the Mac also have a touch
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.200]  screen?
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:25.520]  Right.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.800]  And I don't want to bring up Dunkin Donuts again, but I'm going to, because I'm looking
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.360]  at this app on my screen right now.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.120]  And it's, it sucks to navigate this with the mouse.
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.000]  And I just want to like click on this thing right here that says, locate my closest Dunkin
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.800]  Donuts.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.760]  And that would be a lot easier than clicking around to it.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:51.040]  It, uh, my example, and I didn't choose this, you know, to be, uh, a jerk and try to find
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:51.680]  a bad app.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.040]  It's like Apple themselves have shown the HBO.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.240]  Um, I've already blanked on HBO, Mac, why don't they just call it HBO?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.960]  God almighty.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.640]  It's the dumbest, it, the dumbest thing in the world, right after Rudy Giuliani's shoe
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.920]  polish hair dye.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.160]  Like, why would you put that on your head before?
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.840]  Was that confirmed to be that?
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.320]  I don't know.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.960]  Somebody, I, nobody, yeah.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.320]  Somebody said it was mascara.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.760]  That mascara is a trick.
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.800]  If you're an older gentleman and you've got graying sideburns and, uh, you, you can touch
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.360]  them up before a TV hit with mascara.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.080]  But it's funny.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.200]  I saw it running.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.760]  I was in the city yesterday and, um, I was in an elevator and I saw it and I was like,
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.680]  oh, it must be like a crack in the screen.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.800]  I didn't realize.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.080]  And I just like, you know, it was like a quick fleeting elevator ride and you see it and
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.520]  I'm like, huh, like maybe the screen is cracked.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.160]  It looks like something is dripping down his face, but it must be like a screen television
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:50.560]  crack.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.760]  And then like, I just saw it on, on Twitter last night and I was like, oh my God, it was
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.880]  the screen crack is like actually something streaming down his face.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.240]  It's one of the great mysteries of the world.
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.440]  Um, now I've got this HBO max, so I go on with HBO match.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.400]  I download it.
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:08.800]  I don't know.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.600]  I don't know what they're doing differently, but I've got it.
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.800]  I'm, I'm literally using it as I speak to you right now and it's on the, on the iPad.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.960]  And when I scroll the list on the iPad by touching the screen and flicking, it scrolls
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.600]  like the way you would think an iPad app would scroll, you know, it has momentum and you
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:32.160]  can zip, you know, if it's a long list, you can flick your finger and it goes real fast.
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.600]  When I ran the HBO max app on my Mac, and again, the mystery of the world is why in
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.600]  the world they didn't just call this new service HBO, which is a well-known brand, but
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.160]  whatever, it's HBO max and it's got a bunch of, a bunch of crap.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:46.320]  Yeah.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.440]  And it's got a bunch of crap that's not HBO thrown in.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.040]  The scrolling is horrible.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.640]  It feels it actually, and it's, you know, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:02.720]  It feels like going back to like your laptop reviews from 10 years ago where you would
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.600]  be like, well, this, you know, is a good PC laptop for X, Y, and Z, but the trackpad is
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.240]  horrible.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.160]  It doesn't scroll, you know.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:10.400]  Yep.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.560]  That's 100%.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.560]  That's what the HBO max app running on the M1 Mac book was like.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.240]  And, and, uh, for me, I have HBO max, but we get it through our, we have, we still have
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.240]  cable TV and we pay for HBO and if you pay for HBO, then you get a free account on HBO
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.200]  max, but you have to sign in through your cable provider.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.840]  Well, guess who my cable provider is Xfinity.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:39.280]  Guess where Xfinity is on a list of cable providers in North America.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.720]  And they have all of them.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.560]  There's a lot of cable providers in North America.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.440]  Mine is at the bottom of the list and I'm just sitting there with two fingers on the
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.520]  trackpad, scrolling and scrolling, and it's like moving two, two names at a time.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.040]  And I was like, Oh my God.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.120]  And I was like, well, wait, maybe I can type, you know, X cause you know, like in a real
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.880]  Mac app, you can jump to the X.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.600]  That's true.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.360]  And of course not because it's an iPhone app.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.640]  Did you hear the little bloop?
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:06.960]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.600]  You just hear it.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:07.760]  Yeah.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.720]  You just, or maybe I don't...
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:10.960]  I love the new little bloops in Big Sur.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.080]  Oh, I love the sounds.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.200]  Yeah, the sounds are great.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:13.440]  Yeah.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:13.680]  They're really great.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.680]  It's like, you hear like a bloop and you're like, that's an error, but I feel really like
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.480]  thank you for making that error sound so nice to me.
[01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.600]  Like I'm pissed.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.680]  Like I'm pissed that that thing won't do what I asked, but thank you for making it sound
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.200]  so gentle and nice.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.240]  Yeah, it's very nice.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.480]  I'll sit there and hit the delete key when you can't delete anything just to bloop, bloop,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:32.980]  bloop.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.960]  So I'm just, it just made me, and it just made me so angry.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:44.720]  Cause it, and the icing on the cake of course is that Xfinity is owned by Comcast and it's
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:49.280]  just, they rebranded their cable service as Xfinity because they thought it sounded cool.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:54.480]  And maybe the name Comcast started having negative connotations in people's heads, but
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:58.560]  if they had still been named Comcast, I would have gotten to it so much sooner.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.200]  And I'm like, well, wait, this is insane.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.480]  Like why would their scrolling be so bad?
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:11.680]  And then I looked on the iPhone and, you know, when you're using actual touch on the actual
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.200]  iPhone, the scrolling is very fast and when you somehow, whatever there, whatever's going
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:24.160]  on with the interaction where the trackpad gestures are faking touch, it works terribly
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.760]  in HBO Max, but that's not universal across all apps.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.920]  Like, so I use Marco Armondt's Overcast podcast player and his app, you know, Overcast is
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:41.200]  written like with standard UI kit controls and scrolling a list of podcasts in Overcast
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.840]  on the Mac works exactly as you'd think.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.440]  You know, it feels like you're scrolling in a Mac app and it has momentum.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.520]  And when you flick your fingers fast, it goes fast.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:57.440]  Like something about the HBO Max app is doing something custom that works for real touch
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.040]  on a real iOS device and does not work here.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.560]  But Apple's the one telling me that HBO Max is a good example of an app to try.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.520]  The window isn't resizable and it's like a little, it's like a little postcard size window.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.480]  Are the windows resizable on any of these?
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.240]  I haven't found one to be resizable.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.760]  Overcast is if you try it.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.080]  It is.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.320]  Yeah.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.000]  Even if you don't use Overcast, normally you just download, you can download it for free
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.480]  and try it.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.160]  Yeah.
[01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.520]  And it's something...
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.440]  I guess that's some tweaks that Marco and his team made.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:29.760]  Yeah.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.080]  Yeah.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:36.720]  Because like all of the ones I've been using are mostly iPad apps and those are not resizable.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.720]  And I went to go play like subway surfers and it's so on and they're, I guess, written
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:50.560]  their apps it's like vertical on iPad orientation because it actually intersects with the toolbar
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.920]  at the bottom of the dock and you can't resize.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.080]  So you have to shrink your dock to play.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.080]  Because it's covered up.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.800]  Right.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.960]  It's a very good experience, I have to say.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:09.200]  It all works and you understand, you know, this is the way there's been technology companies
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:15.600]  that have, well, if it works, ship it, has been a mindset ever since technology has been
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.000]  a thing.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.200]  But it's certainly not, it's the opposite of the Apple way.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.680]  Apple's way has always been, well, we'll do a lot less, but what we do is going to work
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.880]  really nice and we'd rather not do a thing at all than do it in a half-assed way.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.880]  And these apps are just half-assed.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.520]  And the ones you really want, like Netflix, not there.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.240]  Not there.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:36.560]  Right.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.600]  TikTok, not there.
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:44.560]  So this is why I ask, why not just put a touch screen on?
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.600]  And I guess your argument's going to be that that's not an Apple thing to do.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:58.880]  But let me just say, I spent quite a bit of time on a Pixelbook and I would say I use
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.000]  the touch screen on that 10% of the time.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.680]  But when I do use it, it's like I reach up, I scroll, I tap, and this is with Android
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.520]  apps on there, I'm out.
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.520]  I'm back to the touch bed, I'm back to the keyboard to do what I need to do.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.000]  I think that's the model that should be on the Mac.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.240]  And I just ask, why not?
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:23.440]  Why don't they just do that?
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.680]  It would solve a lot of the problems we're talking about right now.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:31.120]  So my argument, I think I speak to why they haven't.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:33.600]  Well, number one, maybe they will, right?
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.520]  And I definitely am not betting that they never will.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.760]  I mean, I guess I want to get in on our bet.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.080]  We have a bet me, Dieter, and Nilay.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.400]  I probably should get in on it.
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]  I don't know how to, how do we make a four-way bet though?
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.640]  We haven't really figured out the rules.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.440]  We just all said when we think it's coming and then how much money?
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.800]  I would still wager against them doing it, but I would not wager, and I like to bet lots
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.960]  of money, but I would not bet a lot of money on it.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.720]  I would bet a little bit of money that they are never going to ship touch screen Macs.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:08.080]  Or by some definition of never, that's like, let's say five years.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:13.200]  Because who knows, five years from now, who knows what the heck is going on?
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.040]  I think they won't.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.920]  I think that, I get it.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.400]  I get that if you just want to scroll, like you have a big old browser window and you
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.320]  just want to touch the screen and flick it and scroll up, that if you could just reach
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.480]  out and touch your screen the way you touch the iPad, it should just work and people want
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:32.960]  to do it.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:42.240]  But my argument against it is, and if that's all Apple did, if they said, don't change
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:47.120]  anything else, which is going to make the screen respond to touch, then that would,
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:53.280]  to me, would be the, okay, I can live with that way of Apple adding touch to Mac OS.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.160]  I wouldn't use it personally very often.
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.520]  When I have my iPad in the Magic Keyboard, it's not like I'm purposefully not touching
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.000]  the screen.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  I just don't find myself doing it.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.280]  I just use the trackpad.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:12.560]  See, and I think Big Sur, I mean, I said this in my review, it's just like, it is asking
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.600]  for a touch screen, like these widgets and these swipeable notifications are just screaming
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.880]  out, please swipe me away.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.120]  And I find that on the touchpad, it's quite annoying to be swiping away these notifications
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:25.600]  all the time.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.680]  Now, I'm not saying I always want to be reaching up to swipe away those notifications.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:35.120]  I'm just saying, touch for swiping away notifications or touch for tapping on some of these bigger
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.960]  interfaces that they've built in, the sort of the control panel thing.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.200]  I love this little thing now.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.480]  They have the control center or notification center.
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.000]  I don't even know what they call it in the Mac.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.680]  The thing that you get when you click the time in the upper right corner.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.240]  Well, that, but now you have this little like control center thing, which has like do not
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:57.040]  disturb and keyboard brightness, which I love.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:57.540]  Right.
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:04.240]  Like those are slider that like that wants me to swipe that wants my finger to be used,
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.360]  put my finger on it right now.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:05.840]  I'm doing it.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.320]  I'm touching the screen and pull it down the screen brightness.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.400]  I mean, that looks like it was designed for my finger.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.640]  But most of that, but some of the new stuff does.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.080]  But I think it's just, it's just an aesthetic look to make it look like it.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:25.280]  Now the sun and some of the stuff is cross platform, like the widgets that you get, you
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.920]  know, like you can say, Oh, give me a calendar widget over there.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:35.120]  And the, the notification center thing, um, are written cross platform with the new thing
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.840]  Apple has called Swift UI and the same Swift UI that makes a widget that you can put on
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.920]  your desktop on your phone is the same code you use to make one that runs on the Mac.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.720]  And therefore, yeah, it does look like they're laid out to be friendly for touch, but most
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.720]  of the Mac interface isn't right.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.320]  And I, and, and so many people seem to think all of Big Sur was redesigned and re-spaced
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.000]  for touch, but it wasn't like the menu bar is still tiny.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.240]  The distance between regular menus, like when you go down, you know, like the file menu
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.320]  and it's file edit view, you know, whatever those, those items are all like half the height
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.040]  that they would be for touch to be touch friendly.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.160]  Like when you look at something, I'm looking at all that right now.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.720]  You're right.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.360]  It's, you know, I wouldn't want to touch any of that.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:28.560]  It, uh, the red, yellow, green buttons that close, uh, I always forget what yellow, yellow
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.280]  minimize.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.440]  Um, it's like, and nobody uses yellow.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.280]  People close, people zoom, poor old yellow in the middle.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.040]  I mean, I just, I always use a keyboard shortcut for that.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.080]  So I never use it.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.200]  They're not spaced for that.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:45.520]  There's, and there's all sorts of apps with toolbars that are, you know, pro apps that,
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:52.720]  uh, and the argument is, so what, okay, just leave all the spacing the same and people
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.400]  with touchscreen max will learn.
[01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.360]  Well, don't do that.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.680]  Don't try to touch the yellow button in between red and green because it's so small.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.040]  Just use the track pad for that.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.080]  But then you can use touch when you do want to reach a thing that is a big fat target.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.280]  Like, Oh, there's a big notification that just came in the upper right corner.
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.400]  I just want to flick it away.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.000]  I get it.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.920]  And if they did it that way, that, like I said, that would be my, I could live with
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.640]  it way, but that's not really the Apple way.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.000]  Like the Apple way is if they're going to support touch, they're going to make it a
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.040]  touch friendly interface.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.960]  And if they're going to make it a touch friendly interface, then everything has to be bigger
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.880]  and spread apart like the iPad.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:35.120]  And that to me would take away from the information density of the Mac.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.640]  Uh, I don't think, you know, so it's a very valid argument and that's, and that's the
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:46.480]  argument that I really do here and I think is very, is very realistic that they wouldn't
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:46.880]  do it.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.240]  But on the other hand, on the other hand, it is, and you know, it's a marketing point,
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.600]  you know, the makers of other laptops definitely make ads that say, you know, our laptops have
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.040]  touch screens, theirs don't.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.280]  And we know who they're talking about when they say they, people do reach up.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.560]  I know, you know, and so I'm not, I am against it, but I'm not like, this isn't a
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.760]  zealotry thing for me.
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:18.640]  And as long as they don't ask developers to rejigger everything to make it touch friendly,
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.080]  which to me would really take away, truly take away from Mac.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.280]  Fine.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.560]  You know, if you want to just say we have a touch screen and it's good for scrolling
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.240]  and for flicking notifications and you really shouldn't use it for other stuff.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:30.560]  Okay.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:36.640]  And I guess, and you know, maybe the pencil is sort of like that on iPad already.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.720]  And, cause it's not, you know, the iPad is definitely touch first and the pencil does
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.560]  lots of things, but it's not a stylist driven interface.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.240]  And if you, I remember when, when the pencil first came out and you couldn't even click
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:56.480]  buttons with it, it was like, it was really just meant for writing or for, for, uh, drawing
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.080]  work and artwork.
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:58.320]  Right.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.360]  So like if you had like a, oh, a notification came up and with an okay and a cancel button
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.800]  and you had the pencil in your hand and you tapped on, okay, nothing happened.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.040]  Right.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.640]  You needed to use your finger.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.040]  Right.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.400]  And it wasn't a bug.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.920]  That was how it was designed.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:17.280]  And it's because Apple is thinking what I'm describing, where if it's going to be a touch
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.720]  interface, it should be touch.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:24.560]  And if we were going to make a pencil stylist driven interface, everything would be stylist
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.840]  first across the board.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.040]  And eventually I think they kind of realized, well, this is kind of annoying when you have
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.840]  the pencil in your hand and just want to tap the button.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:39.200]  So that would be the way that if they add touch to the Mac, I, I hope that it would
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.560]  go where it's like, sure.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.840]  The pencil still, even today, pencil still doesn't do everything.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.480]  It's definitely not a pencil first interface on the iPad, but now it's like, okay, we'll
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.360]  give in, we'll let you tap buttons and stuff like that with the pencil.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:58.560]  Yeah, I guess I see it as like, I mean, the magic keyboard has come so far for the iPad
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.080]  and it really does serve.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.520]  Maybe it's better than just an accessory at this point, right?
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.160]  You can really do use that as like a primary mode of input.
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.160]  And I think that that's not what it would be here.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.960]  It would be a secondary mode of input that you would sometimes use and have at your disposal
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.840]  for these interactions.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.040]  But I really do hear that that's a tough marketing point to make.
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.520]  And also if Apple is going to do it, it's got to say it's doing it for a reason because
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.320]  that's what they do.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.920]  And there's got to be something behind it that makes it magical or special.
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.060]  Yeah.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:47.760]  So I would say, I think that if these apps were better, I would be more inclined to say
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.040]  they really need to do it.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.480]  So maybe it's also a wait and see thing.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.280]  Let's see how the iPhone and iPad apps make their way.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.600]  And if they do make their way and if they're better.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.880]  But yeah, I'm with you.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:05.360]  I'd like that sort of HBO Max situation or the resizing of these games.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:12.640]  I also tried Among Us, which is great to have on here on the Mac if you love playing that
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.720]  game, but it's not ideal for playing.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:15.220]  Yeah.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.920]  Does that have a resizable window?
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.040]  My son plays that game.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.840]  And for anybody who's like me and is out of touch with the state of the art of gaming,
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.720]  Among Us is this really cool collaborative game.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:29.600]  Do you want to describe it?
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.320]  Because you've played it.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.160]  I've watched my son play it.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.800]  I was like, Oh my God, I would be so into that if I were your age.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:36.480]  Hold on.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.040]  I just turned it on and all I hear is blasting music.
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.720]  How do I turn the volume down on it?
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:41.780]  I don't know.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.440]  No, you can't resize it.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.520]  I just opened it to make sure.
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.160]  But at least that one fits within the screen window.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.600]  So you're not having to resize other windows to play it.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.160]  I don't know how the best way to describe it.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.680]  It's basically like a murder mystery game.
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.640]  You get a group of friends or maybe you play with strangers, but then one of you is randomly
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.920]  assigned to be the killer, but nobody knows who the killer is.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.200]  You just know if it's you or not.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.200]  And then you have to run around this game and try to figure out who the killer is.
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:13.600]  Right?
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.280]  That's exactly it.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.280]  And I actually only played it for the first time on here and then, um, me and my wife,
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.880]  I was like, we were just trying to test.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.920]  I was trying to show her, I was testing all these apps and then she became really into
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.000]  it.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.240]  And so now she's playing on her iPhone all day long.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:26.740]  Yeah.
[01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.760]  My son plays with his friends and it's like, it's one of those games where it's like, this
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.640]  actually sounds healthy and this sounds like healthy gameplay.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:39.520]  Like some of the stuff, like when he's shooting people, it's like, maybe we should, maybe
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.800]  he's 17, but it's, or he's almost 17, but it's like, maybe we should.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.040]  Yeah.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.920]  Can you believe that?
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.640]  Geez.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.480]  You met him when he was like four, right?
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.120]  Yeah.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:47.600]  Wow.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.200]  Every time we podcast, you always like tell me, I'm like, how did he just get five years
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:51.600]  older?
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.440]  I know he's 16 going on 17 and it's like, but when he's playing among us, it just sounds
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.160]  like, and it really warms my heart because it's like, Oh my God, to be 16 and not be
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:02.960]  able to see your friends.
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.520]  And it's like, Oh, they're all just having fun and everybody can play whether they have
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.000]  PCs or Macs or people are, some of those friends are playing on phones and it's, uh, but they're
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.520]  just, do they FaceTime like when they're playing phone call?
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:15.760]  Yeah.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.080]  I don't know what I, I, I forget.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:18.480]  Discourse.
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:18.720]  Yeah.
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:20.000]  Cause I think that's, what's nice about it.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.240]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:20.800]  Discourse.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.000]  Like it's like, it's, it's social in the sense that like, there isn't a social layer built
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:26.640]  into the game.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:29.680]  You kind of have to go through a different route and then communicate.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.320]  And, um, yeah, I, I did it play with some random people, which was funny, but yeah,
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.560]  but it's a really great game, but yeah.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.880]  And so, yeah, now you can play it on the Mac if you have a Mac and it's great and it's,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.680]  you know, it's, I, but a lot of this stuff, touch is not a magic.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.280]  If, if they had, if they just secretly said, you know what, guess what?
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:49.840]  Surprise.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.160]  These M1 Mac books do have touchscreens.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:58.080]  We were just waiting for Big Sur 11.2 and now it's, we've enabled it and there, you
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:03.920]  know, it's on, um, it wouldn't magically make these iOS apps running on Big Sur better.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.600]  It might make some things better.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.920]  I'm guessing the age, my HBO scrolling thing would, would work, um, but a lot of the donuts
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:12.640]  app would be better.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.760]  But a lot of, and a lot of the iPhone games in particular are specifically, it's not just
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.040]  that they're designed for touch.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.240]  They're designed to be a little thing in your hand, you know?
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.540]  Yep.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.800]  I don't know.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.000]  And iPad.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.280]  I mean, most of the, the most of the things that I see that actually are successfully
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.520]  ported over are not iPhone apps, they're iPad apps.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.080]  Yeah.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:39.600]  And that's likely because those developers already had done, made some tweaks for keyboard
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.080]  and mouse.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.280]  And this was just the easiest way.
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.480]  And if you've got an iPad app, well, yeah, you've got a bigger screen here anyway, so
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.080]  why not use the iPad app?
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.560]  And Facebook has their iPad app in store and it's actually pretty good.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.160]  I've been using that.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.840]  And, you know, besides from the little frustration that it keeps telling me to open iOS, the
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.400]  messenger app, which doesn't exist, um, it's pretty good.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.040]  You know, it's a nice way.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.560]  What happens when you click it?
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.880]  Does it, does it like, it keeps telling me install and then I go to hit install and then
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.760]  it tells me that's not available for your Mac operating system.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.040]  It's a nice, it's just a loop that goes around and around every day and I can't get it to
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:19.440]  go away.
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.200]  It's maddening to have the like two little dots that say have two messages in there.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.700]  Yeah.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:24.240]  All right.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.040]  Let me take a break here and thank our third and final sponsor of the show.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:33.200]  Our good friends at Squarespace, man, if you need a website, you can start at Squarespace
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.920]  and you just next thing you know, you've already got a website.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.040]  That's how easy it is.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.400]  You can just start, go there and get a free trial, start clicking, pick a template, start
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.800]  dragging stuff around to rearrange it the way you want.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.360]  And next thing you know, you've got a website and it works.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.400]  It's amazing.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:50.560]  You do it all right in the website.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.200]  You need no technical expertise whatsoever.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.960]  If you don't know the difference between HTML and CSS, you're fine.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:02.960]  And if you do, you can get in there and figure, you know, tweak the code to your heart's content.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.440]  They have excellent technical support.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.120]  They have excellent prices.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:15.200]  And again, they soup to nuts, including registering a domain name to get your website started
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:20.080]  and stuff on the back end, just for you as the person who owns the website, like great
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:23.760]  analytics so you can see how many people are coming to your site, where they're coming
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.260]  from.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.680]  Most analytics software is like a nightmare.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.520]  It looks like going into an airplane cockpit trying to figure out what the hell is going
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.080]  on.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.320]  Squarespace's analytics is like one of the best analytics panels I've ever seen where
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:40.640]  it's like looking at a nice simple Honda where it's just like, how fast am I going?
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.520]  That's all you need to know.
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.560]  How much gas is left?
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.360]  There you go.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:44.800]  That's what their analytics are like.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.640]  The information you need to know presented in a very nice way.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.400]  Where do you go to find out more?
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.360]  Go to squarespace.com slash talk show.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.200]  Now you can just go there.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.360]  You get a free trial, 30 days.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.520]  You don't need to pay anything upfront.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.480]  Just remember that, though, when you do go to pay, remember to go to squarespace.com
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.120]  slash talk show to take the site you've been using for 29 and a half days before you pay.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.880]  Go there and you will save 10% off your purchase, including prepaying for a whole year.
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.760]  You can get 10% off an entire year just by going to squarespace.com slash talk show and
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.440]  remembering that code talk show when you pay.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:26.960]  What else do we want to talk about?
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.640]  I know that it's weird.
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.560]  I'm doing Apple's news.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.480]  This whole eight weeks has been insane for Apple.
[01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.720]  And, you know, not because me and you, I'm sure.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.760]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.120]  I'm just glad.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:46.160]  If they had sent me both a MacBook Air and I mean, they sent Jason Snell all three.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:50.720]  They sent him and again, this is sort of like to open the curtain a little.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.120]  It's like they just send you stuff.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:57.680]  They don't really ask, you know, it wasn't like, hey, which one do you want, John?
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.480]  They're like, we'll send hardware tomorrow.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.840]  You know, here, sign this NDA.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.800]  And I sign the NDA.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.800]  And then the next day, ding dong, here's FedEx.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.080]  And I had a MacBook Pro.
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.840]  They sent Jason Snell all three.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.360]  And I'm like, I wouldn't have even opened the other two.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.440]  I just don't have time, you know?
[01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:13.940]  Right.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:19.120]  I have to say, I was very happy to have both, mostly because I think it was important for
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:24.800]  me to like tell consumers, here's the difference, the $200 price difference.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.960]  Here's what, here's the difference for you.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.480]  But it was a lot more work for sure.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:38.560]  And yeah, I've just been exhausted, really is all I have to say here.
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.320]  And four phones.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.640]  Four phones was just too much.
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.600]  It was just too much.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.400]  With radically different, you know, not just like, oh, four different colors.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:54.240]  I mean, you know, and I know we've got, you know, I'll do a phone show next episode of
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.200]  this show, you know, but I had to talk about the Macs first.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:02.240]  And I had to have you on because, you know, you're like my, you know, that's why they
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.600]  put us on CNBC together.
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.680]  We're partners in this.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.360]  Laptop partners.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.000]  By the way, I meant to say $300 difference, price difference.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.880]  I'm very tired.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:12.800]  I'm so tired.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.200]  I'm so excited about next week.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.400]  I was like to not have, I mean, it's hard to complain because these have been so fun.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.280]  It is fun.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.800]  It is super fun.
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.240]  But it is so much work.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.000]  And back to back to back.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.680]  And it was like, and everybody knew, you know, Apple announced the WWDC that they're doing
[01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:36.400]  this big transition later this year, which is Apple speak for the end of the year.
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.200]  But they've had Mac events in the last few years in December.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.000]  And, you know, like the Mac Pro, which everybody had been waiting for for so long, came at
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.120]  the very end of the year.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:53.200]  And I think the iMac Pro the year before or two years before, whenever that was, was in
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.240]  December.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:59.040]  So the idea that maybe we wouldn't hear about these things until after Thanksgiving was
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.320]  definitely possible.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:07.200]  You know, but if it was going to be before Thanksgiving, it had to be at the beginning
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:13.360]  of November because they couldn't have had the event two days ago because then the reviews
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.960]  would all be coming out Thanksgiving weekend.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.760]  That doesn't work.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.640]  You know, that's right.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.640]  And so it was like, oh, exciting.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.720]  They're going to have the Mac event on November 5th or whatever the date was.
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.680]  And it's like, well, wait a minute.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:30.560]  I just got done writing about all these iPhones.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.000]  I'm not really I'm not even done.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.520]  I still have I've got reader comments to go through and follow up on their questions.
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:38.640]  I haven't even had a chance.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:39.680]  And now I've got to do this thing.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.160]  It's terribly exciting, but it's been an avalanche of stuff to review.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:44.960]  Yeah.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:48.240]  And I mean, it's I think it's everything was such a leap.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:52.320]  I mean, the the luckily the watch was not such a leap this year.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.120]  You know, I'd like to say like, thank you, thank you, Apple.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:00.560]  Honestly, like blood blood, blood oxygen level.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.520]  Okay, yeah, there you go.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.200]  Right, right.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.600]  Actually, I just wrote our we're writing our holiday gift guide.
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.800]  And I was like, the best thing about the watches here is the solo loop and the end.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.300]  Yeah.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.240]  That's what I wrote most about, too.
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.280]  And not to not to I don't think that's because they ignored it.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.360]  I think the watch is in such a good place.
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.360]  And that, you know, don't mess with success.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.920]  We added another sensor and we've got a loop.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.040]  And that's great.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.480]  And it's like, Oh, thank God, I can move on to these other products.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.320]  But the the phones were so significant, though, I have to say I thought there would be much
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.640]  bigger interest in some of the phones, at least, you know, just from readers.
[01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:41.120]  It's always very interesting to me to see which products readers really gravitate towards.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:45.520]  You know, the 5g upgrade was it was news.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.720]  It was big news.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:48.160]  They focused a lot on it.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:53.040]  That was like a lot of testing work. They had a different size.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.440]  I mean, it was such a significant iPhone upgrade.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.120]  And then they also had the HomePod in there, which was, you know, that's was big to a $99
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.160]  HomePod, a $99 anything from Apple's pretty big deal.
[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.680]  And then these laptops, which are just like, really spectacular.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.640]  It's just like, it was exhausting.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.880]  So I agree, I still haven't written about it.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.320]  And like the my, my here, I'll spoil it.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:26.000]  My bum thumbs down review of the season is for the the mag safe duo charger.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:26.640]  Oh, yeah, same.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.320]  I haven't written I haven't even taken out of the box.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.960]  Oh, it's but it works fine, I guess, but it's $130.
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.960]  And it doesn't come with the wall adapters.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:37.440]  So it get me started on chargers.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:42.320]  And it wants the 20 watt adapter, because it charges both things at once.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:49.440]  But even with it, it does still doesn't charge the iPhone at the full 15 watts that the standalone
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:50.960]  mag safe cable does.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.840]  So you're still not getting again, if it's I don't know what it is, I saw a thing on
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.880]  Mac rumors about it.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.360]  And if you're charging overnight, who cares if it's at the full 15 watts, if it's close,
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:07.200]  you know, and if you're really into I need to charge fast, you shouldn't be using the
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:08.720]  wireless at all.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:12.480]  But still, it's $130 and needs a $20 adapter.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.920]  It's 150 bucks.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:21.360]  And why not just use the the why the watch thing that came with your watch, and the $40
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.000]  mag safe thing and that's it and you're done.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.920]  I can't believe it's $130.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.720]  Even the $40 mag safe thing to me seems like a rip off.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.000]  Frankly, it feels like it should be cheaper, because it feels like it's just a cable and
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.320]  I know it's not just a cable is short.
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:39.680]  The cable is short, I have to say I made a point of this in my iPhone.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.040]  The cable is very short and is really not usable to put next to the side of your bed
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.120]  unless that your nightstand is super short.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.960]  Yeah, because it's like one short nightstand.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:49.680]  That's great for you.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.360]  But I don't have a short nightstand.
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:52.800]  No, it's not a tiny nightstand.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:53.120]  Okay.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.040]  I have a gigantic nightstand.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.000]  It's beautiful.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.040]  No, it's like to use my phone while I'm in bed.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.600]  I have to like, stick my hand out over the side.
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.240]  Right.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:02.640]  Right.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.320]  I'm like huddled on the side of my giant nightstand, apparently.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.040]  Oh, and then the other thing have you done this where it's like you if you try to if
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.760]  you pull it a little bit further to get a little bit closer to you, it won't yank out
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:16.560]  of the wall.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.320]  Of course, what happens is the magnetic connector separates, right?
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:25.360]  I mean, because what's the you know, it is mag safe, you know, so you you pull the phone
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.720]  a little bit closer.
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.520]  And of course, it's this big, heavy I mean, by the standards of urine bed, it's this
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:37.680]  big, heavy disk, and it falls and makes noise and wakes up your partner in bed.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:39.680]  And it's like, sorry.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.480]  But what you've also just described is like it actually should just plug into the wall.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.080]  Like just as a normal plug into the wall.
[01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:48.880]  Because that's what you have.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.520]  You're using it.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:51.840]  You're using it as if it's plugged in.
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:55.760]  But anyway, 140 for that plus a charger.
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:00.160]  The the HomePod mini is 99 bucks and comes with the 20 watt charger.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.040]  Can you believe it?
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.520]  It comes with the charger right in the box for $99.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.800]  But it should just be buying HomePod minis for the chargers.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.200]  It is not realize that by the way, I told you just told me that
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:22.480]  to me they they perfectly it's like the two counter counter ends of the Apple value chain
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:28.720]  for this year's products is on the one end, you've got this really nice little speaker
[01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.400]  that to me sounds great.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.760]  You know, I've seen people who've reviewed more of all of the various products in the
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.240]  space who have slightly different rankings of which one sound best.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:42.320]  But at the very nobody says it sounds bad.
[01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.200]  It sounds pretty good.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.920]  The base isn't shockingly good.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.400]  You know, if there's anything that's short of its base, but it sounds good.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.080]  99 bucks and it comes with a 20 watt charger.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.240]  On the other hand, the duo charger thing for charging your watch and your phone at the
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:02.480]  same time is $130 and doesn't come with the charger and all it does is charge two things
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:08.400]  that are due to just feels so much more expensive than it should be.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.800]  It's and I don't want to go back to the max, but the max do ship with the charger.
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.720]  But those are gigantic chargers for what they do.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.720]  Yeah, I did this.
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.400]  I did a piece a couple of months when the charger thing happened when Apple stopped
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:23.760]  shipping the chargers.
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:29.440]  And this is I mean, I don't know who is in charge of Apple's charging ecosystem.
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:34.000]  But my assumption is that actually the teams don't talk, right?
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.840]  And so the team that does the chargers for the max are doing the chargers for the max.
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.880]  And then the team that's doing the charger for the watch and the phone, maybe they talk
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:48.800]  because they worked on your really your wonderful product, the $130 MagSafe Duo project.
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.160]  They must have worked on that together.
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.400]  But these things don't work together.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:40:00.800]  And what needs to be made is a central Apple charger, a corded charger that can power all
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:06.800]  of these things and is a smaller charger again, charger, which is the you know, the new the
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:11.520]  new hype around chargers and has a couple of USB C spots in it.
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.240]  That's right.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:12.960]  Right.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:13.440]  That's right.
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.240]  So that's what I'm using.
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:21.680]  I'm using an anchor or no, an all key 100 watt charger that's the size of something
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.160]  in between one of the Mac chargers and the the 20 watt Apple charger.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.520]  I got it.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:29.200]  I got to get I'll send you this link.
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.080]  I recommended this.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.040]  But I, you know, look, am I applying to be the head of Apple chargers?
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:35.540]  Maybe.
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.560]  But like, it's time to do some work here.
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.040]  You know, if we're going to wrap up on something chargers is it because you did a deep dive
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:43.540]  on it.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.440]  Right before these things came out, which is welcome, right?
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:54.480]  Like and I know you and I have a past appearance on this show, we I got you I got you revved
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:55.200]  up on cables.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.120]  Remember, I sent you over the mono space.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.800]  And I feel like we've got the cable situation more under control these days.
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.680]  Now that it's you know, everything is USB C or the phone is lightning.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:13.440]  And that's not to derail this on whether the phone should also be USB C.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.760]  But at least we've got it down to two things.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.880]  We know that the high speed chargers all take USB C out.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.400]  The thing that we need is I need we need chargers that are smaller.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.720]  Why is Apple's 20 watt charger so big compared to the Aukey and Anker ones?
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:29.520]  It's ridiculous.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:36.000]  The Aukey and Anker ones are almost and by I think practically speaking, you can say
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.800]  they're the same size as the classic Apple five watt dice charger.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:41.920]  Right.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.160]  And also what's still happening is that this is this is what's baffling to me.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.480]  They're still selling the Apple five watt charger for the same price as the 20 watt
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:50.960]  charger.
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.120]  Which is nuts.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.680]  It's still $19.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:56.800]  They should give them away.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.400]  Remember when they first took out the headphone port and then they you could like go in the
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:05.680]  Apple store and they it was like it was like $5 it was that literally famously, the cheapest
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:12.800]  thing Apple has ever sold in its retail stores were those headphone to lightning adapters.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.680]  It was as close as they're ever going to come to giving something away.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.040]  That's what they should do with those five.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.440]  But the margins like I just picture whenever they sell one of these five watt chargers,
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:26.080]  a man or woman in Cupertino just cheering every time they sell one.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.440]  They're like the margins, the margins.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.200]  They're just some little old accountant looking guy who's got like one of those green
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:40.720]  eye shades on and it's like his whole job is just making money on these incredibly right.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.880]  And they've probably got like 50 zillion of them that they already made, you know, and
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.840]  they're just sitting there and they just keep shipping them off and they're the smallest
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:48.560]  thing ever.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.880]  The only thing that's the thing no one no consumers have really ever understand people
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:57.920]  that are into phones and understand under get that like this five watt charger has been
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.400]  horrible.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:04.400]  And I you know, I definitely dramatized the killing of this thing and the video that I
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:09.120]  did but I've had such hate for this thing for many years because people just assume
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:13.840]  this is like the way they should charge their phone with this tiny little charger that is
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:19.840]  oh, like that is now that could be that same size could could charge your phone five times
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:23.760]  as fast if it was had the right technology in it.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:32.080]  And I for years, I was less critical of it still being included by default than most
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:37.680]  people, you know, like you most of the fellow tech press because I know I heard from people
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.480]  who said that, you know, I wanted one size, but my wife loves the size.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.800]  And you know, and people who say or even people who know the tech, they're like, I have to
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:52.160]  charge at, you know, wherever they go, there's, there's this one little spot in the wall,
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.880]  and that's it.
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:55.040]  And a big charger won't fit.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.240]  And this is perfect.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.320]  That's but that argument is over now.
[01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:04.880]  Because these 20 watt chargers from Anker and Aukey just to name two brands, I've bought
[01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:06.400]  both of them and love them both.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.000]  And they're both also 20 bucks.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.040]  So you it is another one of these things like this, like I said about these MacBooks where
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  it's like, have your cake and eat it too.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:17.040]  It's the same price or cheaper.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.120]  They're like 16 to $17.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.600]  They are the same size as the classic five watt charger.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.520]  And they charge at 20 watts.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.720]  And that's what you want.
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:30.080]  You know, that gives you the full speed charging to your phone.
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.240]  It charges magsafe at the full speed.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:39.760]  It would you there's no loss you pay even a dollar or two less than what Apple charges.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:44.000]  You get a way smaller charger than the Apple 20 watt charger, and you get the full speed.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.320]  It's it but no brainer.
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.520]  But it makes me wonder I've been what you know, I wrote about it.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.800]  It they're not using those little 21 ones aren't using Gann, G-A-N.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:56.080]  No, right.
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.680]  They're doing something else.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.440]  But why isn't Apple doing it?
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.520]  And, you know, I don't know, maybe somebody could take it apart and figure that the Apple
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.080]  one is over engineered for safety or something.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.080]  But like I've been using the Anker and Aukey ones extensively for a couple of weeks ever
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:10.960]  since you wrote about it.
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.040]  And neither one of them gets warm or anything like that.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.960]  I if you do notice what happened is Apple changed.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.040]  So the current 20 watt charger used to be 18 watts.
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:23.920]  Yes, right.
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:25.840]  And so they upped it to 20 watts.
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.040]  So it's not like they didn't do anything to that charger this year.
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.400]  I just think they really want to push the magsafe.
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:34.960]  Yeah.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.960]  And there's there's something with that, though, like you said that their charging teams aren't
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:42.080]  communicating like yeah, they're definitely not communicating.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.920]  Yeah, they're definitely not communicating.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:51.120]  The 20 watt and 18 watt from last year, this year's 20 watt Apple charger and last year's
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:55.680]  18 watt, you have to have good eyes to see the difference.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:58.320]  The new one does say 20 watt.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.360]  The 18 watt doesn't even say 18 watt.
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.400]  It has like a blank spot on the underside where the new one now says 20 watt.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.680]  But the only way you could really tell that it's 18 watt is to read the tiny little fine
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:18.560]  print that is a tiny and be like 3% gray text on white background.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.920]  And it says like two amps times nine volts.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:27.280]  And you have to know that you multiply volts times amps to get bridge.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:27.780]  Yeah.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:33.760]  I mean, the main the big question for anyone working in Apple's charging unit, which I'm
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:41.360]  not sure is even a real thing is why not one charger to charge all the Apple gadgets?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.400]  Well, or at least all of them up to MacBook Pros, right?
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.600]  Because the so like the MacBook Air comes with a 30 watt charger and 30 watt is, you
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.600]  know, like 30 watt to me is the the dividing line between consumer technology and the chargers
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.880]  that are over 30 watt.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.960]  I forget what the new MacBook Pro comes with.
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.680]  I think it's a 45 watt charger, maybe it's 60.
[01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:04.400]  I don't know.
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:04.800]  It's funny.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.680]  I never I all I did was open the box to see the size of them.
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:08.720]  And then I laughed at them.
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.200]  And then I use my new anchor.
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:14.720]  No, my odd key 100 watt charger, which is like one of the best gadgets I bought of the
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:15.120]  year.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.880]  But that's the other thing is that why why does an Apple make a bigger one that has a
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:20.720]  couple of USB spots in the back?
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:26.640]  Because I, I bought my wife, my wife got the new iPhone 12 Pro Max, the big one.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.080]  Really?
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.480]  Yeah, she likes the the Wow.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:32.240]  She's hooked on these big phones now.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.840]  But she feels like well, if it's kind of cheats, thinks they're all too big.
[01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.600]  And she didn't want I was like, well, now they have them.
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:39.600]  And she's like, I was already boring her.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.040]  She was like, just get me the one I'm used to.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.080]  I was like, all right.
[01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:44.240]  But I got her the MagSafe charger too.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.320]  And I was like, this will surprise her because this is so much more convenient overnight
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.600]  than plugging in lightning.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.880]  And then I went to her side of the bed, and she doesn't have any spots open anymore.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.240]  So what I need is I need it.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:01.440]  I need a I need a plug with two USB things because she also wants to charge her iPad.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:02.960]  And yeah, Apple does.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.000]  Donkey ones are good.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:05.520]  New GaN chargers.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:09.600]  They're like six 60 watts for like, I don't know, 30 bucks.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.240]  Crazy.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:10.960]  It's crazy.
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.080]  There's so much better.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.920]  It's it's really, but I do worry and I feel like you might have a better sense of this
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:23.600]  is how many people just feel like, oh, you're supposed to use the one that comes in the
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.960]  box and that that there's something right or magical about it.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.160]  And for the most part, I don't think you can ever like break a product by plugging it into
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.000]  the wrong outlet.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.320]  It's just that, like, for example, I tried this with the new HomePod mini, which ships
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.160]  with the 20 watt charger, right?
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:46.960]  A $99 speaker that ships with a charger, the $20 $20 charger.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.240]  But I plugged it into the 18 watt charger from last year, and it doesn't work.
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.080]  It turns on, but it just glows.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:57.920]  It pulses orange on top because it actually needs 20 watts.
[01:48:57.920 --> 01:48:59.440]  And that's where I'm interesting.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.480]  That's where I'm thinking.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:03.840]  I actually talked to Apple about it and they're like, yeah, that's, you know, we knew that.
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.320]  And that's why, you know, it recognizes that.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:06.820]  Yeah.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.880]  But that just to me says that they weren't all on the same page a year ago.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:17.840]  Like somebody a year ago should have known that they were going to come out with these
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.680]  products that needed 20 watts and therefore not come out with 18 watts because now, even
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.400]  if you have an 18 watt, cause you bought an iPad last year and it came with it, it doesn't
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.360]  charge the HomePod.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.600]  You know, now you've got, it's
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.120]  Or an iPhone or an iPhone pro.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:36.480]  An iPhone pro, last year's iPhone pros shipped with the 18 watt.
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:36.980]  Right.
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:37.840]  Right.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:41.040]  And it doesn't, it won't charge the MagSafe at full.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.960]  It will work with MagSafe, but won't charge it at full speed, but it won't charge a HomePod,
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.360]  even though it looks exactly like the charger for the HomePod and the whole thing.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:49.860]  Yeah.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:54.080]  And I think the move to not put the charger in the box was a fine one.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:56.960]  I was actually fine with that, but I do think they should have done that.
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:03.040]  They should have last year or two years ago, gone from the five watt to the 18 watt USB-C
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.080]  because the real issue is that, and this is what I heard from a lot of my readers is I
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:09.360]  don't even have a USB-C charger.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:09.860]  Right.
[01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.360]  Right.
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.720]  They had bought phones years ago.
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:13.680]  They have a USB-A.
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:16.080]  They've got tons of the little bricks.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:16.580]  Right.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:21.120]  But they now have got a phone with a core that has USB-C and they didn't have anything
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:22.400]  to plug that into.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:22.900]  Yeah.
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:27.120]  That's where that, you know, that's where Anker and Augie sold a bunch of these.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:27.520]  Yeah.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.400]  And I have to say, I was just looking for a USB-C to, you know, USB-C on both sides,
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.600]  cable of the right length.
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:40.320]  And I, you know, I don't, I guess I overspent on cables over the last few years, but like
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.440]  I bought, I have an awful lot of cables with the old rectangular USB-A on the one end that
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.360]  I don't really need anymore.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.480]  Whether they go to USB-C or go to lightning, it doesn't really matter.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:53.600]  I want USB-C on the charging side end.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.120]  Same.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:55.620]  Same.
[01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:00.640]  I mean, what's more frustrating is some of these accessory makers just not having gone
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.160]  from micro USB to USB-C, but that's a whole other story.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:04.480]  Yeah.
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:08.800]  So anyway, I do think you're right that for a number of years, Apple should have been
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.680]  shipped before they stopped including chargers in the box.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:17.200]  They should have been using, including chargers with a USB slot in it.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:23.280]  And it's crazy because even if you bought the iPhone 11 last year, it came with the
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:32.160]  five watt charger, which A is, you know, wimpy wattage wise, but still had the old port,
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.240]  which means you couldn't plug in a new cable to it anyway.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.760]  And all this is true.
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:38.080]  Yeah.
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.880]  And I think the, the big question becomes like, is this transition to MagSafe, just
[01:51:42.880 --> 01:51:49.600]  a step towards, you know, the full wireless feature, which has been rumored, it's just
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.280]  not a good foot to get off on.
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:56.240]  Like just, just this MagSafe stuff is, I love the idea and theory and I love the MagSafe
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:56.720]  wallet.
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:00.560]  I have to say that's like best, one of the best accessories Apple's ever made.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:02.640]  But.
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:07.120]  See, I'm glad you mentioned that because I feel like I've, the people I've spoken
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:12.160]  to about it, it's not for me, I don't really have a need for it, but I think it's very
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.040]  clever and I can see why people would like it.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.800]  But yet most of what I've heard from people is, ah, it doesn't stick firmly enough.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:20.240]  It would come off in my pocket.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.160]  And it's like, I don't think that's the use case.
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.360]  So it did.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:30.960]  I, I maybe have perpetuated that because in my review, I showed it sliding off, but then
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:39.200]  I, that was on the 12th and now I've been using the mini and it actually is, it doesn't
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.360]  fall off as much on the mini, maybe because the covers, the entire surface area of the
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:43.920]  back.
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:44.160]  Right.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.840]  It's like the perfect size for the mini.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:50.400]  Like that was one of exactly the same size as the mini.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.920]  Oh, we were in that briefing together.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:53.040]  No, I don't think I was.
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:54.080]  Oh, maybe I was.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.920]  Yeah, maybe I was in there with you.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.640]  Yeah.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.560]  But I found it out on my own at some point and I was like, Oh my God, this is amazing.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:06.800]  It's like the exact radius of the, the leather wallet is the exact corner radius of the mini
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:07.840]  and it's a perfect fit.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:11.360]  And it doesn't fall off as much on the mini is what I'll say.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.720]  See, now there's a team that was clearly working together.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:20.960]  The wallet team, the wallet team clearly had access to the full iPhone 12 industrial design
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.880]  and came up with a clever wallet.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:23.200]  Yeah.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:28.800]  I feel like the, the whole in this whole, the idea of, and I've been, this is what I've
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.040]  been saying is I don't think the iPhones are ever going to have USB-C ports.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:37.840]  I feel like they're going to have lightning ports until they have no ports that the next
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:40.000]  step is no ports, not USB-C.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.600]  I believe that.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.560]  And, and you know, it's there.
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:49.120]  I know there's people already rumoring that the, you know, next year or the two years
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.160]  at some point there's already phones in the pipeline that don't have ports.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.600]  I believe it from a technical standpoint, but I don't believe it from a pricing standpoint,
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:58.000]  right?
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.440]  If, if the cheapest thing to charge it with is a $40 cable with a puck on the end that
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:08.800]  doesn't come with the power adapter, that's a hell of an expensive way.
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:13.680]  I mean, I guess they would just include that with the phones, but that's 40 bucks, right?
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.360]  I mean, if it's,
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.040]  Yeah, it'll come down in price and
[01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:18.720]  I don't know.
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.640]  The whole thing would be so much more compelling if the, the MagSafe charging puck was 19 bucks.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.800]  Because then it would be, man, that's a no brainer, buy two of them, put them everywhere
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.880]  you use, you know, you need to charge your phone.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:35.840]  It's just 40 bucks feels like too much for what's effectively just a cable.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:39.680]  It just happens to use a clever magnetic connection thing.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.600]  And the cleverness is awesome.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.800]  And it's way easier to connect and disconnect and you can pull on it and it just falls off
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:49.440]  and it won't break in the, in the port.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.800]  And you don't have to worry about getting dust in there and cleaning it out with a toothpick
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.720]  anymore or whatever else could happen.
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.080]  That's all great, but you shouldn't have to pay 40 bucks just for a cable.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.280]  I mean, that's a lot of money.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.120]  It's, I, it's really interesting that you think about it as just a cable because it
[01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:04.240]  really is what it is.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.040]  Right.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:08.880]  You know, you kind of pull away the, like, it is a wireless charger, but it's not the
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.520]  pad and it's really just this, this inductive or,
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.440]  Yeah, it's just a cable.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.520]  But, but even to that point, I don't know.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:23.120]  I mean, you've got the fact, the fact that it charges slower.
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:26.800]  The fact that, I mean, I guess my biggest two issues, there's like, it charges slower
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.960]  and the cable is too short, right?
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:31.600]  If they fix those two things, I'd be cool with it.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:31.920]  Yeah.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.960]  And that is the thing.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.160]  And I run into it.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:39.360]  I mean, for me this year, at least I never run into the, Oh my God, I need to quick get
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:42.240]  a charge because we're leaving and my phone's almost dead.
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:48.080]  Cause I'm not leaving anywhere, but I have run into the, Oh, I'm reviewing the pro max
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.400]  and the mini and Oh my God, the pro max is finally almost out of battery life, but I
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.080]  need, I need to keep using it.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.200]  Let me quick get a charge.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.480]  It is surprising when you do plug it into a hot, you know, like a 20 watt charger with
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.200]  a cable, it's like, wow, that really does get back to like 50% very fast.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:05.920]  30 minutes.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.240]  Yeah.
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.000]  It's really impressive.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.520]  And that is the other, you know, in addition to the cost of the MagSafe cables, there is
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.320]  that it's hard to go back on that, right?
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.000]  Like that at the very least, Oh my gosh, if you find out your phone is down to 10
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:24.320]  percent and you're leaving for work or something or going out to dinner, when we can go back
[01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:27.680]  out to dinner again, you'd quick need to charge it.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:28.880]  MagSafe doesn't cut it.
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:30.160]  Yeah.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:36.400]  And I did a lot of speed testing on the chargers even before the MagSafe, but when MagSafe
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.760]  came, I did the charge tests and it was slower than what Apple was saying it would charge
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:41.920]  at.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:46.240]  I mean, they were saying 15 Watts delivery doesn't necessarily mean it's charging at
[01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:47.120]  15 Watts.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:47.680]  Right.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.440]  And, you know, it took upwards, like close to an hour to get to 50% on some of the iPhones.
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.320]  I mean, you know, it's like, it is, I, I agree with you.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.200]  It depends on the case.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:01.360]  Like I don't really care if I'm charging overnight.
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:01.600]  Right.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:03.280]  Right.
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:07.360]  But what I do care is that like it's MagSafe is certainly better than the wireless charger
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.040]  I have next to my bed, which forgot, like I didn't line up right last night and didn't
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:11.440]  charge.
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:12.720]  So true.
[01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.800]  You know, that actually happened to me last night.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:15.360]  I woke up this morning.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.560]  I was like, why is my phone dead?
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:19.040]  Oh, it's now I'll never go back to that.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.920]  Yeah, I gotta, I gotta change those all out.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.840]  Uh, anyway, well, it's, we're two hours on the button.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.360]  I, I don't think we've hit bedtime.
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:31.280]  It's true.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.320]  We haven't hit bedtime.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:33.120]  It is Friday though.
[01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.120]  So maybe I will just, maybe I will take a nap.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.800]  Always a pleasure to have you back on this, on the show, Joanna.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:39.840]  What an exciting time.
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:41.440]  What an exciting time.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.560]  And I'm sorry again, John.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.520]  I, I did not mean to take the word craptacular-tastic from you.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.600]  Um, and I did not mean to say you didn't look great on air.
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:52.960]  You, you looked wonderful on air.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:55.760]  And actually, in fact, a lot of people on Twitter were commenting on and how good your
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.240]  hair looks.
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:57.520]  So I thought the same thing.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:00.800]  I really, I think quarantine has been kind to your hair.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.320]  Yeah, it did.
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:03.040]  Thank you very much.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.920]  It's very kind.
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:09.040]  And I will say, I will add just the one to go back to why I agree to go on CNBC.
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:10.320]  It does make me take a shower.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:13.360]  Well, I feel like it's like, yeah, this is a good start.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:15.360]  I feel like here's a fresh start to a weekday.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.360]  I mean, I have to say I stopped wearing, I wear pants, but I stopped, like, when I first
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.160]  started doing these during quarantine, I was like, okay, I'm gonna put on my whole outfit
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.560]  and put on jeans or put on nice black pants.
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:29.120]  And now I'm just like sweatpants and a nice shirt on top.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.600]  So clean shirt in the shower.
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:33.920]  I will.
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:34.720]  We'll try.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:35.120]  All right.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.080]  Well, I really, I, I always love having you on the show.
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:39.360]  I can't wait to see you again.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.320]  I don't know.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:46.320]  Hopefully soon, but, uh, hopefully on CNBC and we won't be starting a camera date again.
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.120]  Well, you know what?
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:47.920]  That's my next step.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.840]  Now that I've, this is my next, this will probably be the last time.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:55.920]  Well, who knows when I'm next beyond, but my next project for me now that I've caught
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:02.720]  up is trying to figure out a truly a real camera, camera, home webcam thing.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.920]  So I don't know what I'll do, but it probably won't be on a MacBook camera again.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.640]  Well, use the, I use camera.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.240]  I use camo camo has been great.
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:14.480]  And, or you can hook up a good camera.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.320]  I loved also, there's a lot of commentary on Twitter that like, you really care about
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:18.800]  cameras.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:21.200]  And so you really worked on your lighting setup.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.200]  And I was thinking to myself, what?
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:27.520]  Like, yeah, John has like thousands of dollars in lighting gear in his house.
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:28.480]  Like, no, he doesn't.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.160]  Like, I don't have anything.
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:30.800]  I have a window.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:31.680]  Yeah.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:32.800]  And I had a window too.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:36.480]  And I'm like, I just like the, I loved the assumptions that you like know how to work
[01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.000]  cameras better than me and that, you know, a lot more about camera webcams.
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.360]  And I was like, okay, all right.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:41.680]  Yeah.
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:42.960]  But I'm happy.
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:46.080]  I thank you for having me on to defend and to apologize.
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.720]  It's been craptacular.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:49.840]  It has been.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.520]  Oh, all right.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.560]  Go get some Dunkin Donuts.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:57.440]  Yeah, it's probably what I need to stay up now that it's bedtime at 4.30.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:00.320]  All right.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.440]  Well, thanks for having me.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:02.080]  Let me get this.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:04.420]  All right.
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:06.260]  I'm stopping.
[02:00:06.260 --> 02:00:34.740]  I am stopping as well.
