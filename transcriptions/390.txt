[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660]   Somehow, Apple Notes, which has been rock solid for me for years, is not syncing from my Mac to anything else.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.640]   That's why I had to disappear.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.160]   And so I actually printed it out.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.400]   I had a weird one the other day where I realized I'm hopelessly dependent on being able to copy something from my computer and paste it on my phone.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.120]   Yes.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.700]   Or copy something on my phone and paste it to my computer.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.420]   And it stopped working.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.120]   Yes.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.080]   And I realized I had no idea how to do anything anymore.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.740]   I've had that exact same thing, the continuity feature, which also, to me, has gotten way more rock solid in the years since they introduced it.
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.960]   But because it's gotten more rock solid, whenever it does break, I'm the same way.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.600]   I'm lost.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.160]   I'm like, wait, how do I do this?
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.660]   And then I started doing incantations.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.060]   I found a terminal command on a forum from five years ago.
[00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.500]   So maybe that worked, or maybe it was just the fact that I restarted my computer.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.420]   It's one or the other, but it's back.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.380]   I think I'm like a functional human being.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.840]   I think I need to restart my computer.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.440]   What else was, what was my other reason?
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.700]   I had a, oh, I know what my other recent problem is.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.320]   It might be good fodder for the show.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:23.160]   I took a ton of photos at Thanksgiving and just family, nephews, nieces and nephews and my parents and typical family stuff.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.040]   And I took a bunch.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.540]   I took a bunch of them with a third party camera, my Rico GR three, which I love and has me taking more photos.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.520]   Like my number one tip.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.540]   This is my number one tip is having gone a couple of years shooting almost all my personal photos with my iPhone instead of a camera.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:52.500]   The biggest change since I bought this Rico GR three, I think in March of this year is I take way more photos than I do when I use my phone.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.900]   Like at a family event.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.480]   Like really?
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.380]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380]   It's like something.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:11.460]   Some combination of battery anxiety with my phone and not wanting to have my phone out and it's, and having just a dedicated, I don't know, maybe it's just me.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.920]   I don't know if it applies to other people, but literally just having an actual little point and shoot camera.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.720]   I take just way more.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.240]   I mean, like I took hundreds of photos at Thanksgiving and I never would never ever.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.120]   Would have taken hundreds if I was only using my phone.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.720]   I don't know why that is, but I feel like it's, it's the opposite for most people.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.760]   You give them a phone, they start just firing off shots and assuming that Google photos or Apple photos or whatever, we'll just figure it out for them.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.660]   It could be me.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.120]   I don't know.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:53.300]   But anyway, what happened is over the weekend, then I was like, don't do the, I don't want to do the stupid thing and just have all these hundreds of photos sitting in my photo library and never go through them and share them with my family.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.880]   I was like, I'm going to take a couple hours Friday, Saturday.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.160]   They triage all these photos, get all the good pics, share them with my family, blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.280]   And I also had hadn't used Apple photos, de-duplicate feature.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.840]   I don't even know when it came out, but I was like, you know what?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.620]   I should do this.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.320]   And it found for some reason, a different assortment of duplicates on different devices.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.080]   Like my iPad had a couple, but my Mac had a bunch.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.220]   It had an 80 of them or something.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040]   And I'm like eyeballing them.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.280]   And they all, I scrolled through the whole list.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.520]   They all looked good.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.200]   Yes.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.560]   If I hit do this, this is going to get rid of the duplicates and do good things.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.960]   And the other problem I had, I don't know which one caused this and which one didn't.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:50.480]   The other thing was I wanted to move a bunch of photos to an album and it wouldn't let me move them to an album because a bunch of them, it said were unsaved.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.500]   And I don't know.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.860]   I didn't know what that meant.
[00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.860]   What do you mean?
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.720]   Save a photo?
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.440]   And Apple photos, like the whole thing and photos.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.760]   But what it meant was they were ones from like messages that, you know what I mean?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.160]   And it's, they weren't in your library.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.500]   They weren't in my library there.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.380]   But I said, yes, save them.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.540]   And I think that's the main problem.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.400]   I said, yeah, sure.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.260]   Save them all.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.120]   And then I went to my recents and my recent album and Apple photos only had three, the
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.560]   three.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.260]   Most recent photos I had taken.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.040]   And then it was just random photos from the last 15 years in a random order.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.920]   And I thought, oh, my God, something I did here.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:44.440]   And I was using dark room, which I love because it's sort of like light room, but it uses your Apple photos library as your library.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.540]   I was like something I did here jumbled all 50,000 of my photos into a random order.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.440]   And there was nothing.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.840]   There was nothing I could do to fix it.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:07.900]   And I was like, oh, but what it was, was those photos I saved from messages are deemed recent
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.340]   because it recent doesn't go by the date on the photos.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.820]   It goes by when you added them to your library.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:22.700]   And so once I scrolled like 388 photos down into my library, boom, there's the other 50,000
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.140]   all in chronological order.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.320]   But 380 photos or so was enough that I scrolled, scrolled, scrolled, scrolled, scrolled, and
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.160]   decided my entire library was entirely out of chronological order.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.300]   And I was like, I'm going back to film and I'm just going to start putting print photos
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.780]   into a book.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.500]   And that's my theory is that the Apple library is untouchable, right?
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   Because it's the most photos.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.200]   It's all the I mean, I can't say that I have a good photo management technique.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.820]   I just have a very strong opinion about it.
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.640]   So there's the Apple library, which is untouchable.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.340]   Just leave it alone.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.960]   Don't touch it.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.720]   It's the most brittle of all of them.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.660]   I find the Google library is everything goes into it.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.840]   All the, all the photos from everywhere go into it.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.460]   And then I have Lightroom, which is where all my full resolution DSLR and mirrorless
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.020]   photos go.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.320]   And that is just going to be a cost that I carry forever.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   Right?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.540]   The thing about Lightroom, I think I saw you posting about this on threads the other day.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.740]   The AI denoise in Lightroom is it has.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.960]   Read jiggered my relationship with my cameras, right?
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.420]   Because it is so good.
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.940]   It is.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.500]   And I'm like the world's leading practitioner of what is a photo hand wringing.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.640]   And I'm just like, whatever denoise it, just have at it.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.800]   Just invent some pixels, make it look good.
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.360]   My ancient D 7,500, my Nikon D 7,500, which I love, which is from, I want to say it's
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.760]   2014.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.400]   It's old.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.000]   Like this camera is ancient.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.700]   I just took it to Disney world with, you know, with a big fun lens on it, but it,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.460]   Lightroom just remade this camera.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:02.480]   I'm using it in places that it was not usable before it ISOs that frankly, I didn't even
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.940]   know why they enabled them on this.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.140]   Like they were unusable.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.540]   And now I'm just like firing away with this thing.
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:14.520]   And I realized the thing about iPhone photography is that you get so used to how much noise
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.540]   reduction it does and how good at it it is that when your other cameras can't do it because
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.420]   the processing isn't there, you're like, oh, this camera isn't good.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.420]   When really it's you're, you're just used to the amount of processing that's happening.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:35.220]   And so I added Lightroom to the mix and it's like my old cameras are just back in the game.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.140]   Old lenses, old cameras, the camera that I've outgunned that I think, I think it's time to
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.540]   upgrade.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.340]   Um, uh, when my daughter was born, I bought a Sony RX 100 Mark four.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.420]   And now this thing is like the screen on the back is chip.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.960]   It's like this thing has been everywhere.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   It's, it's lived in my pocket.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.120]   For five years.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.740]   And I think that one that I'm past the range of its capabilities.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.040]   Like I run into its limitations more than I'm happy with the photos it takes.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.340]   So I think that when it's time to upgrade, but my old Nikon plus Lightroom, it's like
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.960]   it's, it would be hard to convince me to buy a new camera at this point, at least in that
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.720]   size.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   We have too much other stuff to talk about, but I used and loved Lightroom for years and
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.100]   never really abandoned it.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.740]   What I did was I packed up an iMac that was on my desk when I was getting my office completely
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:37.220]   renovated and then never unpacked it because I switched full time to a MacBook pro.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:43.360]   And so I still have Lightroom and I've got like these Lightroom classic or Lightroom
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.180]   Lightroom classic.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.700]   This is from before the Adobe cloud era.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.860]   And one of the things that gives you peace of mind about Lightroom is at least Lightroom
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.760]   crop classic.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.880]   It organizes your phone.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.520]   It organizes your photos in the file system.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:01.140]   So like worst case scenario, as long as you can read the disc that it's on and there's
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.760]   no version of Lightroom in the future that runs on whatever computer hardware you have,
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.260]   you've still just got all the original images there and you lose like your Lightroom edits
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.720]   if you haven't exported them or something like that.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.760]   But that's not a bad worst case scenario where your original images off the camera are all
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.780]   safe and sound chronologically organized into year, month, day.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.500]   And so you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:24.520]   And so you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them and you can just go and get them.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.100]   Which is awesome.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.760]   But that thing about the denoising, I was like somebody else.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.720]   I forget who posted it.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.520]   I'll see if I can find it and put it in the show notes.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:40.940]   But somebody on threads was just more or less saying that the new AI powered denoise in Lightroom turned this and it was like, I don't know.
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.880]   He was shooting it like ISO 25,000 or something in that range.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.740]   And it was like a picture of some animal at nighttime in the dark and it turned it into this.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.520]   And it's it looks like the cover of National Geographic.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.380]   It is like absolutely insane.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.220]   It's insane.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.340]   I will say I think that's a good example.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.140]   And I know you're right that you are sort of the leader of what is a photo philosophical debate.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:11.840]   I would say that falls clearly on the side of not.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.980]   It's still a photo, right?
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.020]   Color grading.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.600]   And no, if you look at it, I have some photos from this trip to Disney.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.300]   They're just in the dark where someone's hair is.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.400]   It's just a mess of pixels, right?
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.360]   And your brain is okay.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.300]   There should be some hair and then Lightroom is like, here it is.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.460]   And you're like, that is not contained, right, right, right.
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:39.140]   You just have enough information in Adobe Firefly to be like, okay, here's some, here's what some fringes of hair looks like.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.180]   We can do it.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:47.200]   And it's the same as the Google best take feature where it's like, am I, am I really lying?
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.200]   Like the hair wasn't in place, like whatever, like the camera doesn't have enough data to think.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.380]   So for me to conclusively say that my hair was frizzy, but Lightroom is like, you know what?
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:57.980]   Let's put it there.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.940]   Maybe that's on the blurry edge of acceptable.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.020]   And I think most people have family photographs.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.800]   They don't care.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.720]   Right.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.760]   But it's still kind of like every time I hit the button and I don't even, I don't even hit that button one by one anymore.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:17.360]   I hit, I select all in batch process, all of the photos off this camera before I begin editing.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.120]   And it's like the GPU in my M1 pro is pegged for an hour.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.940]   And then I come back and I finish the edits and I'm like, first of all, it's like awesome to peg your GPU.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.820]   It's like the most, if you're a computer nerd, you're like, I I'm working now, but you're not doing it.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.680]   You're just like waiting, but then you come back.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:36.580]   These photos are incredible.
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:51.220]   Well, I guess my, my breaking point on that philosophical question, what is a photo is, is it still attempting to present to you?
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:12:01.320]   A moment of reality from the perspective of the lens of the camera at a certain moment in time.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:08.680]   And if the answer is yes, then I think you're on the, this is still a photo side of it.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:21.880]   And yes, filling in fine details like hair, like strands of hair are so small that the individual pixels of noise would interfere.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.460]   And yes, filling in fine details like hair, like strands of hair are so small that the individual pixels of noise would interfere.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:38.800]   With what they were and therefore it has to be filled in and it's literally filling some content in that the image didn't originally contain it, but it still is capturing a moment of time from that perspective.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.060]   Whereas the Google, what do they call it?
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.780]   The best take, best take, which is a cool feature.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.760]   Like I wrote on daring fireball about it.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.860]   Like I find this feature highly questionable and I know that I would use it.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:52.860]   Right?
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.780]   And this is how I feel about Lightroom.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:09.940]   It's, I think it's on the safer side of the line, but you know, there was a time in the culture where Turner movies, colorizing black and white classic films caused a great deal of hand-wringing about the sanctity of art.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.940]   And we are just, just imagine trying to tell a teenager we used to worry about colorizing black and white.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.980]   It's gone, right?
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.360]   Like we are fully past it.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.840]   My line is like, did this happen?
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:32.680]   If, if, if you cannot confidently say about a photograph that that thing happened, we're probably a little too far and we should recalibrate.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.360]   And I know a lot of people are trying to recalibrate in various different ways.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.820]   It does seem best take is a great example of this.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:45.760]   I have received from many people, the argument, well, something like it happened and that's good enough.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.320]   And it's, I, I think you should move that one back.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.780]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.560]   And it's, it's only going to move forward from here, right?
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.020]   It's like, we're nowhere near at the end point of, did you see these features?
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.880]   Xiaomi has the Xiaomi 14.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.620]   Let me see it.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.440]   Let me make sure I'm correct.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.480]   Make sure it's the 14.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.800]   Yep.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.120]   Okay.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:18.440]   So the Xiaomi 14 just came out and at the launch event, which is very much like an Apple keynote, they demoed a feature in the camera where you just feed it some photos.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.900]   And then you say, make a photo of me standing up.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.600]   And it just does it.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.420]   And that's the camera.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.600]   And it's not, this is not like the science fiction hypothetical.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.280]   This is a thing they demoed on stage while launching the phone.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.580]   Okay.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:41.520]   Well, that's, it is something and it is cool, but it's not photography, right?
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   I mean, there's also things, features like that, which I, I, I, I know that there were probably people.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.580]   I was too young and therefore too, oh, this is nothing but cool.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:15:01.100]   And I refuse to, to even read anybody's down saying or, or downplaying of it.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:09.560]   Like when Photoshop first became a thing, you could do all sorts of things in Photoshop that previously you couldn't practically do right.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.540]   There were ways to manipulate photos in the analog film era, right?
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.240]   There's the famous pictures from the Stalin era in the Soviet union, where they would.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:38.100]   Erase people who had been erased from the, the, the, the Politburo from photos, you know, and dot the Dodge and burn feature in Photoshop is named after an actual physical technique that you would use in the dark room when you were developing film.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.320]   It's all cool, but it does.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.940]   I don't know.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:48.940]   I, and, and, and, and you come from you, you, you lead a publication that has actual.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:57.020]   Photos that your staff takes and that therefore you guys need rules for what counts as a photo, right?
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.880]   Most publications have some sort of house rules for that.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.040]   Same way you have rules.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.220]   Most places have rules about datelines.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.960]   You can't claim to be reporting from Israel if you're not actually on the ground in Israel.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:19.600]   There's a very internet-y nature to the conversation about what is a photo because people bring it up as though no one has ever considered the problem before.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:19.920]   When in fact.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.440]   In reality.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.240]   Right.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.160]   People have been considering the problem for hundreds of years since the dawn of photography.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:34.700]   And so big news organizations, especially the big photography organizations like Getty or AFP or what have you, they have very restrictive rules about editing.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:46.580]   The best example I can give you is if you look at the New York Times, New York Times basically can't do any editing and that the house style for the New York Times, whenever they want to get arty, is they just vignette the hell out of their photos.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.140]   And once you see it, you cannot unsee it.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.880]   And you're like, oh.
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.340]   This is the only knob you have.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.000]   Let's go for it.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.240]   Just turn it up.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.380]   Like vignetting.
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.640]   You can go read the guidelines.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.360]   They're all basically the same.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.300]   You can remove dust and scratches and all this other stuff.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.420]   But you can't actually edit the photo.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.200]   Right.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:12.480]   And you can crop, which shows you the fact that they even mentioned cropping as an issue shows you just how conservative they are.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.820]   Right.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.420]   And for some of them, you can't crop in a way that changes the image of the photo.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.520]   And that is even if you're a licensed.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.820]   If you're a licensee.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.640]   So like the Verge has a Getty license and our Getty license has restrictions in it.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.340]   They do not want us to use their photos in a way that would convey some other meaning.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.120]   OK.
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.720]   Like all of that, I think, is fair.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.660]   But it.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.160]   I as this stuff goes to consumers, it's Google has best take.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.560]   You can't drop.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:47.780]   There's 200 years of AFP photo licensing restrictions under the camera app of your Pixel 8.
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.500]   Like that's that.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:49.740]   That's.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.540]   That's just not realistic.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:50.920]   Right.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.900]   You can't expect anybody to learn that stuff or even understand why that stuff is being imposed.
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.220]   So you got to come up with something else.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:04.080]   And I think that's the moment we're in where the companies have to decide what restrictions are they're going to place on the tools.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.880]   The platforms that distribute the stuff like Instagram and YouTube have to decide what restrictions or labels are going to put on the stuff.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.880]   And then we have to decide what is acceptable as a culture.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.560]   And all of that stuff is in.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.180]   I wouldn't even say tension.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:16.720]   It's like that.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   They're not close enough to each other to be in tension yet.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.160]   The table's just flipped and we're all just looking at all the shit in the air.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.600]   And it's like, I know what the verge is going to write about for the next 10 years.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.180]   But like everything else is pretty unsettled.
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.780]   All right.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.560]   Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.060]   And it's our good friends at nuts.com.
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.060]   Oh, man.
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:36.940]   Your grocery stores.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.800]   I'm sure they've got stuff like pecans.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:47.680]   But what if you want bourbon pecans or sweet and spicy pecans, pecan brittle or butter toffee pecans, all sorts of exotic stuff.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.600]   If you want to try stuff like that.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:50.780]   Head to nuts.com.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.740]   They have hundreds of different varieties of nuts and snacks that they offer.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:07.900]   Nuts.com is your one stop shop for freshly roasted nuts, dried fruits, sweets, pantry staples like specialty flowers, stuff you wouldn't think nuts.com might sell and more.

[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.360]   Quality is a top priority.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.060]   They roast their nuts and pop their corn the same day it ships.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.220]   So they reach you.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.400]   It's deliciously fresh.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.480]   Satisfaction is guaranteed.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.760]   This is this is the time of the year where I start having sponsors who are suggesting gift ideas for you to buy for others.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.780]   Nuts.com is a great idea.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.040]   You can buy someone like a whole platter of stuff.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.420]   Wrap it up for the Christmas tree.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.360]   You could probably get them some kind of subscription if that's the sort of thing you want to buy for someone in your family.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:49.400]   You can shop a la carte anytime or you can opt into automatic deliveries so you never run out of your favorite items.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.180]   I they sent me a whole bunch of stuff at the beginning of their sponsorship and I love it all.
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.280]   My favorite.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:03.300]   I told you the last time is their half popped popcorn, which is just unbelievably addictive.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.940]   I go through it as soon as it shows up in the house.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.360]   It just disappears that night when I'm watching TV.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.080]   So, so good.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.500]   So many other things that they have that are so good.
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.640]   I just regular nuts are so good.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.980]   Their snack mix type things.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.880]   Their trail mix type things.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.640]   All that stuff.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.520]   I got it all.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.920]   It's all very, very good.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.620]   I don't usually eat lunch or make breakfast.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.320]   I just sit.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:34.060]   I love stuff like that to just sort of fill me up until late in the afternoon when I decide to spoil my dinner by eating a late lunch way too late.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.240]   But they've got all sorts of great, great snacks like that.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.220]   And it's just I really love it right now.

[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.600]   Maybe we should get the iPhone 15 talk out of the way.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.380]   This is sort of our annual tradition.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:22.340]   It is.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.200]   We're very late.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:23.940]   We're late.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.780]   We're really late.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.000]   It's been out for a while.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.100]   I'm curious.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.560]   What's your takeaway?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.500]   I mean, I don't know if we should breeze through this or if we have a lot to say.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:39.700]   I am now in a dual USB-C lightning household.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:48.640]   So my takeaway is I got to upgrade my wife and daughter to USB-C iOS devices post haste because it is very annoying right now.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.580]   And I think that's probably.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.000]   That's probably what Apple is worried about.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:59.780]   But once you do it, it is incredible that I just have one cable for my laptop and my iPad and my phone and my earbuds.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:09.500]   And I don't know why they resisted it for this long, because from a user experience point of view, vastly superior to having multiple cables and chargers.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:16.160]   Like, I don't I don't I understand why they held off and I understand that they felt pushed into it.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.560]   And there is a bit of resistance there, but it is actually like.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.520]   As far as superior user experience to just have one cable for all this stuff.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:34.980]   I do think in hindsight now, now that we've waited, I do think that the USB-C transition story is both a the sort of most obvious angle for this year's iPhones.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:40.240]   And oftentimes the most obvious angle is sort of a dumb angle that I don't find interesting.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.960]   Our audience doesn't find interesting.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.540]   But this year, I feel like it actually is.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.580]   And it's for exactly the reasons you said.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.480]   Like, why did it take them so long?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:23:07.220]   And I know that the cynical take has always been that it was about money and that the lightning port somehow made them gazinga dollars every year with licensing for the made for iPhone program and selling lightning cables and stuff like that.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.640]   And I mean, I don't have their balance sheets.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:19.180]   I mean, I can't prove it, but talking to people at Apple off the record, that wasn't it.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.940]   It's Apple almost never.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.700]   And, you know, this Apple executives almost never explain themselves, right?
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:33.540]   It's it's I always think of that scene from there will be blood where Daniel Day-Lewis's character says, I hate to explain myself.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.040]   Apple is like that.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:42.820]   If it's not in the keynote or in the marketing materials on Apple dot com, they don't want to explain why they did X.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.300]   Right.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.300]   They just don't want to talk.
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.380]   They just it's just part of their culture.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.500]   But sometimes they'll say.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.000]   No, right.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.620]   I won't say why, but they all categorically.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:14.820]   I was told that the money they made from licensing made for iPhone stuff for the lightning port or selling their own lightning cables was negligible by Apple standards and that in the past that used to be a big deal, but it really was an iPod era thing.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:19.200]   Like in the iPod era, it was a significant amount of money.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:28.100]   And everybody still to this day, in fact, more and more like when you check into a hotel and they still have a 30 pin adapter on the alarm clock.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.520]   It's oh, my God, how old is this alarm clock?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.300]   Back then that that stuff was a big deal.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.420]   That's not the reason.
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.760]   I really think it best.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:49.460]   My best theory is that they were reluctant to change because they the iPhone is so popular with literally like a billion users around the world that they just.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:58.160]   Didn't want to risk pissing people off and that however frustrating it was for people who just wanted to go USB-C for everything.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.480]   It's not infuriating when they didn't switch for the iPhone 12 or 13 or 14.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.720]   It's just frustrating.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.300]   Whereas switching could risk infuriating people.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.900]   And I feel like they just sort of were gun shy about it.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.180]   I think that's it.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.240]   I think that's real.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.480]   I don't think that's not real.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.780]   Right.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.000]   You don't want to piss off your customers.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   I think that the money piece is negligible by Apple standards is still a huge amount of money.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.020]   Right.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:39.200]   So if you want to run around funding like negligible by Apple standards is enough to fund one movie on Apple TV plus.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:39.900]   Right.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.960]   They're not bad at this.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:48.880]   And I think that like turning off any money, especially when your sales are kind of sideways and it's like a weird time.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.360]   I think that.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.180]   No, Tim Cook is many things.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.620]   He's excellent at making money.
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.380]   Right.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:26:06.500]   Like he's an amazing business person and there's no reason that he's going to incur cost to switch to USB-C while turning off the revenue associated with the old port unless he has to.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:16.600]   And I think with the iPad, they had to in order to make the iPad a credible laptop replacement, which is where they needed it to go.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.400]   And you can debate whether they got there, but they needed to make.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:27.360]   They had to enable faster USB speeds, faster charging and ecosystem of device, all this stuff.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.040]   So they did it because the product demanded it.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.100]   The product for the lightning cable is like it charges your phone.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:35.440]   All right.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.580]   Maybe it connects to your car.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.420]   So they didn't need it for the longest time until they were made to do it.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.460]   So I don't want to say it was the money.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.100]   They needed all the money and they're being greedy.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.700]   I think it's a much more raw, instinctual business decision.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.320]   Why would I turn off?
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.180]   Some money for any reason.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.080]   And it's like it's hard to fault any business for looking at it that way.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.420]   Yeah, it does seem now.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:01.020]   Here we are on the cusp of December.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:07.140]   And it does seem like they switched without really pissing people off.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.580]   Right.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:15.260]   It doesn't seem there's nowhere near as much consternation or, hey, this is a money grab play.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:19.300]   There was when they switched the iPhone from the 30 pin connector.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:27.260]   To lightning with the iPhone five, I believe, was the first one with lightning, which even
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.080]   people in my family, my extended family, at least thought was a money grab like, oh, and
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.660]   it's don't you see how much better this port is?
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.200]   I mean, well, because you don't have to buy Apple's cable with lightning.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.000]   You go by Apple's cable with USB.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.060]   See, you're like anywhere.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:40.860]   Right.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.380]   And there's one of these cables floating around.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:42.980]   Right.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.880]   Well, and the other thing, though, about the money is I really don't think made for iPhone
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.220]   with lightning has been.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.020]   Has been a moneymaker.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.520]   Even I just don't think I don't even know what products it would be.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.460]   What products ship with lightning ports anymore?
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.520]   Very, very few.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.280]   Every single third party cable.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:07.560]   But I got I've talked to people who make from companies that sell their own lightning cables.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:14.620]   And they said, like, the licensing fee really was even by the standards of the company selling
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.060]   the cables negligible.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.140]   It really was just sort of a quality control.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.860]   I think where Apple makes money is selling their own cables in the store and they sell
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.460]   their own USB-C cables for twenty nine dollars.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:27.760]   Right.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.900]   Which are ridiculous.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.420]   Right.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.500]   So they still have that going on.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.120]   I just think that they were a little conservative about it.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.220]   But I will say it with just two people in the house at the moment because my son's in
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:47.140]   college, my wife's iPhone 15 pro because I didn't wake up at the crack of dawn to order
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.020]   it for didn't show up.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:59.920]   And so there was like a six week period where I had an iPhone with the USB-C port and she
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.520]   did not.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.280]   And it really we don't have that many cables around the house.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.460]   I mean, if it was up to me, we'd have all sorts of cables all over the place.
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.380]   She's more in charge of where we're allowed to have permanent standing cables.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.860]   And it did it did interfere with it.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.980]   And now now that she's got one, the one device we have left.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:26.020]   Between us, that still is lightning is her, I guess, first gen AirPods pro or maybe their
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.220]   second.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.040]   I don't even know which gen they are, but because they're not brand new, they have a
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.520]   lightning thing on the case and it's where is she going to charge these?
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:41.080]   And so now it's my job to just sort of babysit her AirPods and every once in a while take
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.200]   them to my office or somewhere and charge them or do they not?
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.420]   That's the one before the wireless charging.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.420]   There is wireless charging, but.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.020]   We don't have a MagSafe puck.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:56.540]   Again, I don't have permission to have a permanent MagSafe puck in the kitchen just for because
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.920]   it would be there just for her AirPods, because otherwise, why would you use MagSafe?
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.320]   Dude, you got to get on Amazon.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.320]   You got to start looking at the alphabet soup brands.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.080]   There's a thing out there that can hold all this stuff.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.640]   Like I walk in the door, I like throw my keys in the thing.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.680]   I put my AirPods in the thing.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.280]   It all looks nice, but it's it's I couldn't even tell you the name of the company I bought
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.860]   this thing from.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.820]   Yeah, right.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:20.800]   That's what Amazon alphabet soup.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.020]   But anyway, I think that's been successful.
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.620]   I think that the I still do.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.360]   I at this point, I still appreciate how much lighter the phone is than the stainless steel
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.240]   ones that they've been selling for years.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:41.340]   And as someone who prefers to go caseless, I know it seems so superficial, but I so much
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:47.860]   prefer the way that it feels in my hand to that shiny stainless steel with not sharp
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.360]   corners.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.840]   Sort of harsh corners.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:55.980]   The matte finish of the titanium and the rounded chamfered edges, whatever you want to call
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.200]   them, are so much more pleasant in hand.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.600]   It's it's now I'm taking mine out of the case to make sure you're not lying to me.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.100]   No, you're right.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.140]   I'm a case person.
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.060]   I dropped this thing left and right.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.820]   And so to me, I think it's fascinating.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.720]   They're marketing this thing as titanium.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.420]   It is the point of the marketing, right?
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:13.880]   It is.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.600]   It is the first word out of all the celebrities lips when they like iPhone 15 pro titanium.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.300]   And it's like most people have in a case.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.360]   What you're going to notice is that it's lighter, which is great.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.100]   I agree with you.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:31.520]   But it's interesting that you and a few people who are frankly insane, who don't have cases
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.100]   are the only people that will ever actually touch the phone.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:40.700]   Well, I think that's always I think that's it's long been fascinating to me.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:46.500]   I did a poll on Mastodon and my audience, of course, is outlandishly unlike the general
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.180]   population.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.580]   But I did a poll.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.940]   I don't know.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.440]   Sometime over the summer, people who follow me on Mastodon, do you put your iPhone in a
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.740]   case?
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.300]   And I think I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.360]   But off the top of my head, my questions were, do you use an Apple branded case, a third
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.400]   party case or no case at all?
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:10.140]   And it was like, I think roughly one third, one third, one third, which blew me away.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:15.420]   I didn't even think amongst my audience that one third of people don't use a case because
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.380]   in reality, it's got to be like, I don't know.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.980]   Ninety five percent of people at least keep their phones in a case.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:28.980]   But I've always thought that part of the reason why is because the phones are so nice uncased.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:37.060]   It's it's like people, even though people like take it out of the most people unbox
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.840]   their brand new iPhone, look at it, appreciate how nice it looks.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:47.880]   They they care about what color they bought and then put it in a case that covers up the
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.420]   nice side.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:54.060]   It's covers up the back color and they never see it again until they take it out of the
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.660]   case to trade it in for a new phone in two or three years.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:04.220]   But it's the fact that they know that inside the case is this beautiful, pristine, shiny
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.860]   iPhone that makes them want to put it in a case.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:17.760]   Whereas if if in some alternate universe, iPhones were sort of G-Shock Casio G-Shock style devices
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:24.420]   that are sort of a rugged, plasticky shell, that's what the device actually is.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.460]   I don't think people would care about putting them in cases.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.020]   They wouldn't care if they get scratched up.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:36.860]   It's and their ads for years during the stainless steel era always way overemphasized how shiny
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.140]   the stainless steel is.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.420]   Right.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.720]   I mean, yes, they were.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.100]   They were.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:46.160]   It was like jewelry photography, not consumer electronics photography to sort of emphasize
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.260]   the difference between the iPhone.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.240]   Pro models and the iPhone non pro models.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.420]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.940]   I mean, the again, this one, I think it's really interesting.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.960]   They're leaning into the material and not the camera or the action button or any of
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.100]   the features of the phone.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:08.220]   And I think it's still a little bit of a remnant of the sort of Johnny Ive fashion era.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:13.240]   Like it still permeates Apple a little bit when they do the big mass consumer marketing.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.460]   These are fashion items are cultural objects, all this stuff.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.220]   I mean, right.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.160]   Next to that is they're showing the Olivia Rodrigo commercials where they're shooting
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:21.280]   it.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:21.500]   Right.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.800]   Like they are emphasizing the technical capabilities there.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.320]   But even that is about a cultural product, right?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.200]   It's not the music video.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.800]   It's not really about the phone.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.320]   Like you wouldn't walk away from that ad being like, I know a lot about the phone.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.660]   What you know is this phone was used to make this really awesome music video.
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:46.100]   And there's much more of a cultural piece to that, which I think emphasizing the material
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.660]   is it's of the same.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:50.120]   Category, right?
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.420]   Here's a, here's a very luxury item at this point where we're, we are in the middle of
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.980]   covering gigantic trials.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.160]   It seems like the entire tech world is literally on trial all the time right now.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:08.060]   And we have this window because of DOJ versus Google, which is all about Apple's deal with
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:10.300]   Google to have Google as the default search.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.840]   And then Epic versus Google, which is all about Google's contractual relationships with
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.160]   various parties who make the phones, who make the apps.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.140]   We have this window.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.800]   We have this window into how all these deals are made.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.820]   And you're like, Oh, the iPhone really is dominant.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.560]   The world warps around this product.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.420]   And Apple just has to make you think it's constantly cool in the marketing.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.340]   Yep.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.000]   Because it's not that you won't go buy a new iPhone.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.360]   You won't forget about it.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:40.260]   But the brand halo of look at how cool the thing I own is, is like important to maintain.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:46.460]   It's fascinating to watch Apple market a new phone, which is, I mean, I think it's very
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.100]   similar to the outgoing phone minus USB.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.000]   Even the camera, like they're right on top of each other.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.460]   I like the longer zoom obviously performs a little better in low light.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.940]   There's the incremental stuff, but pound for pound, they're like very similar.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:06.960]   And there's, in my opinion, there's really no way for a 15 year old product for that not to be true.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.420]   Right.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:12.760]   And every once in a while there will be some sort of breakthrough.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.900]   I mean, the best example I can possibly think of because it's almost a canonical example would be the
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:32.580]   Mac in 2020 at age, let me think here, 36, a 36 year old platform moving to Apple Silicon was a holy shit.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.080]   This is like years of difference.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:47.860]   If you bought like a late or in the middle of 2020, but the last generation of an Intel MacBook of any model compared to what
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:59.600]   you would get in the end of November when Apple Silicon and the first M1 chips debuted, it was like, wow, these are, it's a chasm, a chasm between these two products.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.420]   That's very rare for an established product.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:11.540]   And the iPhone at 15, it's just, you can't, you just can't reasonably expect anything like that on a regular basis, right?
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:17.820]   There really isn't a practical difference between the iPhone 14 and 15 in almost anything.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:17.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:24.400]   In any regard, other than the USB-C and the difference between the titanium and steel.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.760]   And for the people who put them in a case, I put it in my review.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:38.980]   It's like the nice thing about the titanium versus steel thing is even if you are in the vast majority of people who keep your phone in a case all the time, you still enjoy the benefits of the weight reduction.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.240]   Which is not nothing.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.940]   No, it's very meaningful.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.060]   Here's the thing they could do.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.400]   They could steal from Car World.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.220]   So there are these long running.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.460]   Car models in the world.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.840]   And every now and again, they're like, we're bringing it back.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.320]   Here's a Mustang from the 60s again.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.580]   Here's a new Beetle.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.500]   And you're like, will they ever just do the iPhone 4 again?
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:09.880]   Like if they put, if the iPhone 16 was just the iPhone 4 design, but bigger for our time of bigger screens, I'd be like, yeah, I'm definitely buying that.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.560]   Zero questions asked.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.000]   I would buy an iPhone 4.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.120]   I would buy an iPhone 16 sized iPhone 4.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.380]   Oh, man.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:17.740]   That was.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.980]   That was a pretty cool design, too.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.320]   It was easily the best one.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:27.520]   I like the iPhone 5 and 5S best, but for similar reasons.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.040]   Right.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:41.100]   And but for retro nostalgic value, I'd give I'd give it to the iPhone 4, 4S style because it was a little bit more iconic or it stood out a little bit.
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.760]   It was a little bit.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.200]   It was it wasn't like the iPhones that came before it.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.320]   And there hasn't been I haven't been iPhone since that.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.200]   It was even introduced.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:47.500]   I think.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.800]   Like I said, it looks like a beautiful old Leica camera.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.740]   Like it was introduced with a bit of retro to it.
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.200]   Yeah.
