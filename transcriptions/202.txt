[00:00.000 --> 00:05.980]  This should be easy for you. You do video now you do so much video and now yeah, so just recording audio should be a cinch
[00:05.980 --> 00:07.980]  See it's for me. This is complicated
[00:08.760 --> 00:10.760]  Yeah, I do all of I do
[00:11.080 --> 00:13.860]  Single-handedly all the video and audio production at the Wall Street Journal
[00:14.600 --> 00:19.320]  Which is crazy. Yeah, I'm just sitting in the recording booth all day
[00:19.320 --> 00:24.880]  Then I run and I deal with the cameras change the lenses shine the lenses. I
[00:25.520 --> 00:28.540]  Really I do fine and I don't even do the editing of my podcast. So
[00:28.540 --> 00:36.060]  It's I still find you know, I have I have a guy named Caleb Sexton who is awesome and does it for he has an awesome
[00:36.060 --> 00:38.060]  Name. Yeah, he does
[00:38.500 --> 00:41.260]  upload the stuff for him and then he listens through it and
[00:41.580 --> 00:44.640]  Yep, and he finds a place to cut in for the cold opening
[00:44.640 --> 00:47.900]  He takes out all of our stupidums and Oz he makes sure our levels are good
[00:47.980 --> 00:53.460]  Anybody who enjoys the audio quality of this show can think when I curse does he I've you know
[00:53.460 --> 00:58.220]  I've I've listened to these podcasts. Have you ever bleeped me? I don't know. No, we don't bleep
[00:58.220 --> 01:04.060]  We had a thing a couple of years ago where I mean that show never has that much cursing
[01:04.060 --> 01:06.580]  But we had a thing a couple of years ago where a couple of people
[01:06.860 --> 01:11.020]  Must have been listening in their cars or something and sent a note to to Apple
[01:12.100 --> 01:13.460]  That they were you know
[01:13.460 --> 01:18.580]  Mildly offended that the curse words got through and her kids heard him in the car and I got a very nice email from some
[01:18.780 --> 01:23.340]  It was very nice from Apple and and it was a very, you know, it wasn't just like from an anonymous like
[01:23.940 --> 01:27.540]  iTunes at apple.com it was somebody who works there and like hey, I'm on the iTunes team
[01:27.540 --> 01:29.540]  I'm actually a big fan of the show
[01:29.540 --> 01:33.260]  Just want to let you know if you're gonna curse that's fine, but you got to add the explicit tag
[01:33.820 --> 01:36.820]  To yeah RSS feed and that's all you have to do
[01:36.820 --> 01:41.780]  And so I did it and then I don't know it just sort of faded away and I don't we don't really bother with that
[01:41.780 --> 01:43.020]  anymore
[01:43.020 --> 01:47.300]  So you could swear and I don't think it'll be a matter but I don't well remember the time
[01:47.300 --> 01:49.380]  I was on and all people complained about was
[01:50.020 --> 01:56.140]  The sounds of the sirens and the street noise because of my New York City apartment. I I don't understand
[01:56.140 --> 02:01.900]  I do remember that and and I don't I'm very angry with me, but I don't understand why it
[02:02.500 --> 02:08.220]  People would complain about that. It didn't seem to me like it was any more excessive than what I would occasionally get in my
[02:08.660 --> 02:10.180]  We just moved earlier this year
[02:10.180 --> 02:10.500]  Yeah
[02:10.500 --> 02:15.220]  I think I remember it was the sirens because there were I used to live in New York City and it was
[02:15.620 --> 02:19.220]  there was like I was either near it was in I was near a precinct and they I
[02:19.860 --> 02:23.100]  Think what happened was there were a couple of like very clear
[02:23.980 --> 02:25.260]  police
[02:25.260 --> 02:26.860]  sirens and
[02:26.860 --> 02:31.900]  People thought they were being pulled over when they were listening in the car. That is funny. All right, that's that's kind of funny
[02:31.900 --> 02:36.500]  Yeah, I remember when I remember I got some tweets about it and people were very angry
[02:36.500 --> 02:41.640]  And so I moved I moved because of them. I moved to Jersey City where there are no police cars
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.460]  We used to have in our old neighborhood for a while and that thankfully the guy either sold his car or moved
[02:48.460 --> 02:51.440]  But we had one guy I never figured out which car it was
[02:51.440 --> 02:56.820]  But it was a like the world's most sensitive car alarm and number one. This was like five five years ago
[02:56.820 --> 02:59.420]  It's like who still has a car alarm. What is this 1989?
[03:00.420 --> 03:05.540]  But it would go off and and there's nothing I could do like it was you know, and it would you know
[03:05.540 --> 03:07.540]  There's definitely a car alarm and a club
[03:07.900 --> 03:11.740]  You have a club still I have a club. No, I don't have a club. I'm just joking
[03:12.260 --> 03:13.260]  I
[03:13.260 --> 03:15.260]  Used to have a club though
[03:15.260 --> 03:22.180]  Have no idea yeah, I mean that's what that's what was the company that made the club
[03:24.060 --> 03:27.880]  And they had like that they had the they always had those commercials
[03:28.300 --> 03:32.700]  Yeah, I'll tell you what for a while every single car in Philadelphia had the club on it
[03:32.700 --> 03:34.700]  I mean their market share was unbelievable
[03:35.180 --> 03:38.180]  It was all and it was all the club brand
[03:38.500 --> 03:42.000]  product for anybody who doesn't know if you don't live in the US the club was sort of like a
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.720]  Bike lock for your steering wheel and and you'd expand it and it was like a bar that you would
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.120]  I just looked up a picture of it. You should put the link to this. All right, I will make sure here
[03:53.120 --> 03:55.760]  It goes right in this right in the show nuts right in the show nuts
[04:01.760 --> 04:05.840]  But everybody had one and I don't think it really did a damn thing
[04:05.840 --> 04:06.480]  I mean
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.640]  I think like just like a
[04:07.640 --> 04:12.440]  Anybody with like a hammer to break the glass of your car would then take the hammer and shatter the lock on the club
[04:12.440 --> 04:15.460]  Yeah, everybody had one. You know what the club equivalent was for tech
[04:16.100 --> 04:18.480]  Your password being one two, three, four, five six
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.120]  That was the club that you would put on your that was the equivalent
[04:25.360 --> 04:27.800]  Basically when you have your password being one two, three, four five six
[04:27.800 --> 04:32.440]  You're basically putting a club on the front of your phone password, but the the O is a zero
[04:32.440 --> 04:36.360]  Right. I think I used that at one point
[04:38.120 --> 04:40.120]  Do you ever have a car stolen
[04:40.560 --> 04:47.240]  No, Amy had her car stolen when we first moved in together. This is my wife. She had back in like
[04:48.120 --> 04:50.120]  1999
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.480]  in West Philly and and it's like the most bizarre experience like
[04:53.840 --> 04:58.080]  Because she thought she remembered where she parked it and it wasn't there and she thought oh shit
[04:58.080 --> 05:03.240]  Where did I have it and and it took her like 15 minutes of walking around before she realized you know what?
[05:03.240 --> 05:09.600]  I think my car was stolen that happened to me a couple of months ago, but it was towed. Oh really? Oh
[05:10.980 --> 05:14.520]  So, how do you know what happens? What do you how long did it take you to realize what happened?
[05:15.480 --> 05:16.800]  like
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.800]  15 minutes. I
[05:20.120 --> 05:25.060]  Came back in my apartment building my neighbors like oh no, they were towing from that street and I was like, oh
[05:25.060 --> 05:30.900]  And that's how I realized I I you know, they were paving the street
[05:30.900 --> 05:35.020]  And yeah, the Philadelphia parking authority is the most efficient police
[05:35.900 --> 05:38.940]  Organization I've ever encountered in the world if you can call them
[05:38.940 --> 05:42.260]  You know there in some sense of the word the parking authority is law enforcement, right?
[05:42.260 --> 05:46.300]  the law says if you park here too long you get a ticket right and they wear sort of
[05:47.300 --> 05:50.620]  Copy sort of uniforms. They're so efficient
[05:50.620 --> 05:56.980]  It is astounding like there's on Walnut Street here in Philadelphia very busy Street lots and lots like the street where the Apple store is
[05:56.980 --> 06:02.340]  And and there's hospitals down that you know hospitals high-end retail very busy Street
[06:02.740 --> 06:06.900]  I think I forget what time of day I think it's like 4 30
[06:07.100 --> 06:12.700]  You're no longer allowed to park on the left side of the street. It's like they want to open that up for traffic like
[06:13.580 --> 06:16.460]  Like if your car is parked there, it's towed by 431
[06:16.460 --> 06:23.420]  Like it's it is unbelievable how efficient it is. It's like at 4 30 and and one second
[06:23.420 --> 06:28.780]  There's tow trucks every day because somebody you know, it's a type of it's also the type of place where unfortunately
[06:29.300 --> 06:34.300]  Visitors won't just take it like they won't take it first-time offenders. Nope. It's you're out
[06:34.940 --> 06:38.060]  Because they want that, you know, they want that traffic. It's crazy
[06:38.060 --> 06:43.820]  But it's it's like if all law enforcement were that efficient it we would live in some kind of you know
[06:43.820 --> 06:45.820]  Sci-fi utopia where there is no crime
[06:46.900 --> 06:52.600]  Yeah, I mean I could probably do I mean this whole podcast could be about my like trials of I mean
[06:52.600 --> 06:58.440]  I just get a lot of tickets. I have a lot of parking tickets. I just like been collecting them lately. I
[06:59.900 --> 07:07.020]  Live in Jersey City now and I have to like it's alternate side parking for street cleaning and I forget to move it some days
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.180]  and
[07:08.180 --> 07:13.020]  You know, well, that's the other thing in Philly with the parking authority is if you have unpaid parking tickets, they get you
[07:13.020 --> 07:15.380]  I mean they have they they put the boot on your car
[07:16.500 --> 07:20.940]  Really, which is sort of like the a fancy version of the club really? Yeah
[07:21.780 --> 07:23.980]  But far more effective, right?
[07:25.820 --> 07:27.640]  You're really not gonna move that car
[07:27.640 --> 07:32.940]  I remember one time we had a place it was like two houses ago and we lived on a very very quiet
[07:32.940 --> 07:37.940]  It's almost like an alley type Street, but it did have broad sidewalks and it almost never had cars coming down
[07:38.420 --> 07:42.260]  I get was so untrafficked that you could it was a great place
[07:42.260 --> 07:46.260]  It was when our son was was very small so we could go out and just play ball in the street
[07:46.260 --> 07:48.300]  It was almost like we had our own little playground in front of the house
[07:48.820 --> 07:53.900]  One time my father-in-law was visiting and I told him he could park just park on the sidewalk. You'll be fine
[07:54.620 --> 07:58.340]  And we've had guests come over and just had him park on the sidewalk in front of the house
[07:59.180 --> 08:01.100]  For a few hours and nothing ever happened
[08:01.100 --> 08:06.740]  And of course he I went to I actually left the house to go get something like maybe I volunteered to go get coffee for
[08:06.740 --> 08:08.740]  everybody and lo and behold he had a ticket and
[08:08.740 --> 08:14.580]  I took it off his windshield and looked at it and it was like super expensive. It was like like a hundred and ten dollar ticket
[08:14.620 --> 08:17.700]  So I just like put it in my pocket and I was like, oh shit. I gotta pay
[08:17.700 --> 08:23.620]  I hope he never I hope he never gets like a confirmation in the mail like, you know, thank you for paying
[08:23.620 --> 08:28.180]  They usually don't I've done that. I've paid many penny many a parking takes on my parents cars
[08:28.180 --> 08:32.860]  Yeah, because I have a problem right and people out of the city just they're like, why do you live here?
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.820]  right, you know I do like
[08:35.820 --> 08:41.060]  I'm speaking of parking, you know, and I it's I guess it's not an iOS 11 thing and it's more
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.900]  I guess it was in iOS 10, but I feel like in iOS 11 now
[08:43.900 --> 08:48.280]  It's far more aggressive at telling me where I parked my car. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[08:49.580 --> 08:53.280]  That's it. That's a crazy. I think it might be I don't know
[08:54.740 --> 08:58.740]  What about maybe he's just noticed it. All right, hold on a second. I got to do something first
[08:58.740 --> 09:00.740]  I guess I gotta I gotta squeeze in a
[09:00.740 --> 09:06.180]  Correction to a sponsor from last week ero was the sponsor last week and they have a great little home Wi-Fi
[09:06.740 --> 09:09.640]  Thing, you know, it's it's the best Wi-Fi for your home
[09:10.020 --> 09:13.300]  And in the reason it's so great is it sets up a mesh network
[09:13.420 --> 09:17.580]  Meaning you have instead of like one base station somewhere central in your house
[09:17.580 --> 09:19.580]  That's trying to give Wi-Fi signal everywhere
[09:19.820 --> 09:25.700]  You have one main one that connects to your cable modem or wherever you get your internet from and then you put little satellite ones
[09:25.700 --> 09:28.740]  Around your house and their new generation to one. It's so great
[09:28.740 --> 09:33.260]  They just plug right into the wall like a nightlight and they even have a nightlight feature if you want it
[09:33.260 --> 09:38.380]  You can turn it off if you want but to shine underneath the thing and then the app helps you place them throughout the house
[09:38.380 --> 09:45.340]  And it's so easily too easy to configure and it it just spreads powerful a four bar Wi-Fi signal
[09:45.780 --> 09:49.940]  Everywhere in your house, even if your house is very tall or it's very spread out
[09:50.740 --> 09:56.100]  Great product, but I screwed up last week. I said you if you use the code the talk show go to ero.com the talk show
[09:56.100 --> 09:58.900]  That you'll get free shipping now
[09:58.900 --> 10:00.300]  It's true that you get free shipping
[10:00.300 --> 10:04.780]  But the thing I have admitted was that you'll only get free shipping in the US and Canada and I'm very sorry for that
[10:04.780 --> 10:05.700]  It seems it
[10:05.700 --> 10:11.380]  it seems to sell a lot of people outside the US and Canada tried to take advantage of that and they were very very upset and
[10:11.700 --> 10:17.420]  And I apologize for that. Well, my I want to thank you row. Once again, I want to apologize for getting that wrong
[10:17.460 --> 10:20.140]  it's it's free shipping in the US at Canada at

[11:02.100 --> 11:07.940]  Puerto Rican relief funds because the people down there need help. So how about that then? That's a nice guy, right?
[11:07.940 --> 11:09.940]  How about that? That's very nice
[11:10.100 --> 11:13.300]  So it just hit me up and you could even lie you could even say, you know
[11:13.300 --> 11:16.140]  Even if you didn't buy one just tell me you did and I'll do it. Anyway, I
[11:16.140 --> 11:18.740]  I bought one and had the shipping
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.060]  so
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.060]  free shipping to Jersey City
[11:26.780 --> 11:29.060]  What what do you what do you want to talk about I
[11:29.780 --> 11:31.780]  Don't talk about so many things
[11:32.420 --> 11:36.140]  There's so much new stuff that's come out so much stuff. Yeah, I
[11:37.380 --> 11:41.660]  Mean, I mean, I think I know what people want us to talk about which is that
[11:41.660 --> 11:45.800]  They want you to tell me that I wrote a terrible Apple watch review
[11:46.520 --> 11:52.320]  We should start with that. I don't did you get feedback then? I loved your Apple watch review. Yeah, let's talk about it
[11:52.320 --> 11:54.320]  I mean, let's talk about all right
[11:54.360 --> 11:56.880]  so in it inside baseball
[11:56.880 --> 12:02.960]  I think people who listen to this realize this but just the I feel like you kind of need the basic backstory on
[12:03.480 --> 12:04.600]  how
[12:04.600 --> 12:06.320]  It's not just Apple product reviews
[12:06.320 --> 12:12.880]  But you know the Apple product reviews are the ones I'm most familiar with we're reviewing it to get seated out to writers
[12:12.880 --> 12:15.760]  Like me and you and and you know, whoever else
[12:16.880 --> 12:20.120]  Generally about a week before and then there's an embargo
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.500]  We signed a non-disclosure agreement where we can't write about it and like for me
[12:24.500 --> 12:26.220]  The still most frustrating is like with the phones
[12:26.220 --> 12:31.480]  You can't post pictures taken with the phones to social media until this embargo date is over
[12:32.360 --> 12:34.360]  You're not even really supposed to share
[12:34.360 --> 12:41.840]  With anyone right formation about the phones. I mean if you if some of some of these non-disclosure agreements
[12:42.240 --> 12:44.400]  You know, I won't specifically say companies
[12:44.400 --> 12:51.840]  but they will say in it that you can't have even people within your family or that can it's really it's it would only be
[12:51.840 --> 12:53.840]  people within your family or
[12:53.960 --> 13:01.880]  Close colleagues that could know you were testing this device and and then there's an embargo did time which is like let's say Tuesday
[13:01.880 --> 13:08.200]  Whatever date at 7 a.m. Eastern Time. I think that's what it was for for the time that no one's on the internet usually
[13:08.880 --> 13:10.200]  usually
[13:10.200 --> 13:12.200]  Well apples actually gotten
[13:12.840 --> 13:16.120]  it's better than some companies a lot of companies will do midnight because
[13:17.080 --> 13:22.520]  They'll either say because of the markets or they'll say because of other international markets
[13:22.520 --> 13:27.880]  I was talking about the financial markets, but they're also, you know in terms of you know, they've just scheduling around other
[13:27.880 --> 13:34.440]  Time zones, but yes, we're we're we have to agree to the time of when we are allowed to then
[13:35.520 --> 13:42.840]  Disclose our thoughts and then generally most of the reviews are ready to go and drop right at the moment of the embargo time. I
[13:43.360 --> 13:49.720]  personally have sometimes missed that by many hours because I'm so bad with deadlines and
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.040]  Lately though. I've had a good run of it and I think ever since they've switched to these early morning ones
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.760]  I've just in my mind the fact that I think I got to get done the night before
[13:58.920 --> 14:05.040]  Means that if I'm a few hours late, it just means I stay up past midnight one two working on it
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.960]  So it's easier for me. So anyway, all the reviews for Apple watch dropped and
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.680]  I
[14:11.680 --> 14:17.440]  Don't forget what state of the week it was last week, but it was pretty sensational because because you're on a Wednesday. Sorry
[14:18.280 --> 14:20.280]  yours for the Wall Street Journal and
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.880]  Lauren goods for the verge both seemingly ran into the same problem where
[14:26.240 --> 14:29.540]  The highlight feature of this device the cellular networking
[14:30.320 --> 14:32.320]  Did not work
[14:32.480 --> 14:39.200]  Properly, yeah reliably right like sometimes didn't connect sometimes, you know, just didn't work the way it's supposed to at all
[14:40.200 --> 14:47.220]  And obviously those are the two reviews that got the most attention which obviously, you know was not a good day for Apple
[14:47.220 --> 14:50.260]  No, and and you know seemingly
[14:50.780 --> 14:55.940]  one of the reasons they got the most attention was and again, this is some of the inside baseball is
[14:56.700 --> 15:01.060]  Up until the very last minute when we were working with Apple
[15:02.660 --> 15:09.320]  They they were sort of figuring out what the sum of the situation may have been or what were the reasons that
[15:10.340 --> 15:12.340]  Lauren and I had some different
[15:12.420 --> 15:15.700]  You know if you read her review carefully you read mine carefully
[15:15.700 --> 15:20.940]  We had a lot of the same issues where you know connectivity would just kind of drop or we would be in these
[15:21.220 --> 15:24.860]  Patches where I would say disconnected at least that was what my experience was
[15:25.380 --> 15:29.420]  The handoff between Wi-Fi and cellular was one of the things that I had
[15:30.140 --> 15:32.140]  But up until that last minute
[15:32.540 --> 15:39.140]  Apple hadn't really had statements about what they were willing to say could or could not be wrong with the product
[15:39.820 --> 15:42.140]  and so when I first published mine
[15:42.140 --> 15:45.860]  I had a statement from Apple that said we're looking into these issues
[15:46.860 --> 15:48.860]  Lauren had a statement that said
[15:48.980 --> 15:54.020]  Something much more detailed because Apple had sort of said we know about this problem
[15:54.100 --> 15:56.780]  which was the the handoff situation and so I
[15:57.220 --> 16:02.760]  Then quickly had to also scramble an update with a similar statement that Apple provided to me
[16:04.100 --> 16:07.300]  So, you know, I think what I mean
[16:07.300 --> 16:11.100]  I think it's probably a very small amount of readers who wrote to me and said well
[16:11.100 --> 16:12.820]  This is gonna be fixed in a software update
[16:12.820 --> 16:18.740]  Why are you even you sort of going after Apple for this this issue and there's two things one
[16:18.740 --> 16:22.520]  I didn't know the entire time. I was reviewing that
[16:23.220 --> 16:29.300]  there was going to be a software update and as far as I know we still don't have a software update and
[16:30.260 --> 16:36.420]  Two you you can't review based on a future promise, right? I mean, I'm not reviewing the I've the the
[16:36.420 --> 16:41.840]  The watch series 7 here. I'm reviewing the series 3 which is what we have
[16:41.840 --> 16:45.060]  Which is my experience for the week that I had to test it
[16:45.800 --> 16:51.600]  And you know just to even back up from there and Lauren did another she she detailed this in her review
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.960]  And I you know just mentioned that I had tested three of these products
[16:57.280 --> 17:03.120]  Well, I had tested two and Jeff Fowler my colleague. He had one as well and he had had similar issues
[17:03.800 --> 17:05.360]  so
[17:05.360 --> 17:08.220]  From my experience. It wasn't an isolated issue
[17:09.500 --> 17:16.000]  again, we don't really end up really knowing fully when these issues were really happening to either of us, but
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.280]  Again, it's based on your experience as a reviewer. That's that's what that's you know
[17:21.280 --> 17:26.400]  When I when I write I'm going to talk about or I'm gonna relay what what my experience was
[17:27.960 --> 17:29.960]  Yeah, I think that's totally fair
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.300]  Especially since it wasn't resolved by the time the embargo dropped
[17:34.300 --> 17:41.080]  I mean it you know, if they're going to insist on an embargo time where you can't say anything until this, you know
[17:41.080 --> 17:43.960]  you can't you can't review this as a series of
[17:47.080 --> 17:53.160]  Experiences over the week, you know, it's hate that you know, they're saying at 7 a.m. The review drops
[17:53.160 --> 17:56.520]  Well, that was your experience with the product at the time the review dropped
[17:56.640 --> 18:02.340]  It's I think it's totally fair and and I'm with you that you can't you can mention that a software update has been promised
[18:02.340 --> 18:08.100]  But you can't review it as though the software update is out and and who knows if it solves all the problems
[18:08.100 --> 18:10.420]  You don't know, you know, it's right
[18:11.140 --> 18:16.280]  and and and you know there I mean, I think some people also took back where I said like
[18:16.780 --> 18:23.060]  This is not the this was not I had a line about how a phone is a lifeline and it does not do what?
[18:23.540 --> 18:28.180]  You know that many people may rely on on this connection and it does not reliably
[18:28.180 --> 18:35.220]  Fit that part of that. It does not reliably fit that promise or fill that promise and
[18:35.660 --> 18:37.780]  I still stand by that, you know, I
[18:38.740 --> 18:40.380]  there were there were
[18:40.380 --> 18:46.180]  Three times specifically when I had the second version that they had sent me where I did lose connectivity
[18:46.620 --> 18:51.100]  Some people have asked me. Oh, well could it have been because you were on t-mobile and in that sir in that area didn't have
[18:51.100 --> 18:52.240]  service
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.660]  One time I did not have the phone and I didn't check it. So that could have been one of the reasons
[18:56.660 --> 18:58.340]  but
[18:58.340 --> 19:02.680]  Across the board all the other times. I'm very positive that I do I do get
[19:03.380 --> 19:10.460]  T-mobile or AT&T service in those locations. Yeah. Yeah, if it's not as reliable at holding a signal as a phone that's
[19:11.140 --> 19:16.420]  Useful information, right? I mean because I remember I was not a big phone guy pre iPhone
[19:16.420 --> 19:19.300]  I mean I had one but it was just you know, literally a dumb phone
[19:20.140 --> 19:24.020]  But I remember in the early days of having a cell phone
[19:24.020 --> 19:28.000]  Probably, you know, I think I probably got my first cell phone around 2,000 or so
[19:29.380 --> 19:31.580]  And it didn't even look like a candy bar phone
[19:31.580 --> 19:34.960]  It was this thing from Verizon that and it had an actual antenna you'd pull out
[19:36.780 --> 19:41.500]  Like was it like a skinny one? Yeah, like it was skinny. Yeah real skinny almost like a
[19:42.500 --> 19:47.140]  Yeah, like a like a like an even longer Apple TV remote control, right?
[19:47.140 --> 19:53.140]  It's a long skinny roll a phone like that that had something like that and Amy and I got him just I
[19:53.460 --> 19:55.380]  Think literally just so we could talk to each other
[19:55.380 --> 20:02.540]  Well, you know if we needed to in the car and I remember that there were times you would just randomly not have a signal
[20:02.860 --> 20:07.140]  Right, like it was cool to have the phone and you'd be like because you know
[20:07.140 --> 20:11.860]  If you never had a cell phone before it was like, you know, amazing futuristic technology
[20:11.860 --> 20:17.540]  I'm talking on the phone and I'm not connected to anything and it's like if I have to walk three blocks to get a signal
[20:17.540 --> 20:19.540]  Again, well, that's the price you pay
[20:20.380 --> 20:22.380]  But that in the mod, you know today's world
[20:22.380 --> 20:28.080]  I feel like I just have like a hundred percent rock-solid certainty that as long as my phone has a
[20:28.900 --> 20:33.420]  Decent battery charge if somebody calls me it's gonna come through get a ring. Yeah, right
[20:33.500 --> 20:36.420]  Yeah, and if the watch doesn't work like that that matters
[20:37.300 --> 20:38.300]  Yeah
[20:38.300 --> 20:40.300]  No, absolutely. And I I
[20:40.300 --> 20:44.700]  Look, I I do believe that the the cellular to Wi-Fi
[20:45.100 --> 20:51.280]  Issue that that will be fixed in a future update will solve some of the situations I had
[20:51.280 --> 20:58.780]  I do also believe that there was something going on with my unit in terms of how it was connecting with the number sync
[20:59.420 --> 21:03.020]  With with the iPhone, I believe that was another issue I encountered
[21:03.820 --> 21:06.500]  and look overall I I
[21:06.500 --> 21:10.180]  I can't explain why I had some of these drop connections
[21:10.180 --> 21:14.900]  I can just explain that I had them and I still have the same unit and I've still seen the same situation
[21:16.260 --> 21:21.160]  So that that's it. So the main issue that came out was that there was an issue with
[21:22.020 --> 21:29.300]  With public Wi-Fi like let's say like a Starbucks Wi-Fi and if you had previously joined this like a public Wi-Fi
[21:29.500 --> 21:34.740]  Network and it was therefore in like your I I don't know if it goes through iCloud or not
[21:34.740 --> 21:40.780]  but your personal circle of trusted Wi-Fi networks, then you could go out without your iPhone and
[21:41.700 --> 21:47.940]  You're if you're near that network the phone or not the phone to watch. I mean the watch would say hey
[21:47.940 --> 21:50.380]  I know that network, you know
[21:51.220 --> 21:56.580]  John's already signed, you know sign, you know agreed to join this one and I'll get on this network
[21:56.580 --> 21:59.000]  But it was you know, it's it's one of those networks
[21:59.000 --> 22:03.040]  I call them captive networks where like in a hotel where like you have to it is free
[22:03.040 --> 22:07.940]  But you have to like click through sign in it's you know, either sign in or agree to terms or something
[22:07.940 --> 22:13.380]  Well, the watch can't do that. Right? The watch has no interface for going through one of those captive networks
[22:13.460 --> 22:18.060]  so the watch is thinking I'm on and and if you've ever think if you think about it like when you're on like a
[22:18.580 --> 22:24.420]  Laptop or something when you get on one of those networks the Wi-Fi up in their menu bar says you're on Wi-Fi
[22:24.420 --> 22:28.560]  But you can't do anything until you like go to your web browser and you know
[22:28.560 --> 22:32.580]  Go to a web page and go through the thing. So the watch is thinking okay
[22:32.580 --> 22:39.220]  I've got a Wi-Fi connection, but it actually isn't going anywhere because it hasn't gone through the captive thing and therefore nothing works
[22:39.220 --> 22:42.820]  You're not getting notifications. You can't place phone calls. So that's a real issue
[22:44.500 --> 22:48.260]  But it sounds to me like you ran into issues that that might have been one of them
[22:48.260 --> 22:51.800]  But it seems to me like you ran into issues that can't be explained by that
[22:52.540 --> 22:54.260]  right, I mean
[22:54.260 --> 22:58.260]  Possibly one or one or two times I can think about like so, you know
[22:58.260 --> 23:01.360]  I can think back to where I have was in certain situations
[23:01.360 --> 23:02.440]  um
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.680]  One time where I noticed the dropout was actually when I went jet skiing in the Hudson
[23:07.900 --> 23:11.360]  For the video and also just because it's really fun to go jet skiing
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.840]  Right in front of the Statue of Liberty. I suggest everyone do it and no I don't have
[23:16.480 --> 23:20.480]  some sort of foreign illness because of the water
[23:22.120 --> 23:25.160]  But it it is probably very dirty it is dirty water
[23:26.080 --> 23:31.160]  So I just I looked down at the end. I was able to successfully make a call from right
[23:31.160 --> 23:33.560]  You know, I was in the middle of the and you can see this in the video
[23:33.560 --> 23:36.840]  I I made it. I made a call to my dad. It went through to voicemail. I
[23:37.360 --> 23:41.520]  Was right in front of the Statue of Liberty, but we were coming back and going back to the dock
[23:42.040 --> 23:47.560]  I looked down and I had no connection and I had no connection for about I don't know two minutes
[23:47.840 --> 23:51.520]  Till I toggled on and off the cellular and then the cellular connection came back
[23:52.960 --> 23:58.320]  Could there have been a Wi-Fi network on somebody's boat? I don't know with those
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.520]  Sit with the I don't think I don't think so
[24:01.520 --> 24:02.240]  I don't think so
[24:02.240 --> 24:02.760]  No
[24:02.760 --> 24:08.800]  And here's why I don't think so is that on that day one when everybody on the internet was in a panic of oh my god
[24:08.800 --> 24:10.600]  What the hell is going on here?
[24:10.600 --> 24:12.600]  the fear was based on
[24:13.200 --> 24:15.740]  It was just such a hectic day trying to get
[24:16.440 --> 24:18.040]  Zero in on exactly what was wrong
[24:18.040 --> 24:21.360]  But the fear was was that the watch was joining these networks
[24:21.360 --> 24:27.220]  Even if you'd never joined them before and as best I can tell and according to Apple people I've spoken to at Apple
[24:27.220 --> 24:29.220]  That's not happening. That wasn't happening
[24:29.480 --> 24:36.300]  It was only networks that you've joined before but the problem is there's a lot of those networks like like here in Philadelphia. There's
[24:37.060 --> 24:40.280]  There's an like citywide Xfinity Wi-Fi
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  right and
[24:43.080 --> 24:49.460]  So that's something it's not just like one coffee shop that has a network that you might be on like if I don't know if
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.360]  If that's one of the networks that would cause this but you could be anywhere in Philadelphia
[24:53.360 --> 24:59.640]  I mean like so it's very funny that you said that because that could that is what I think might have happened to me in Jersey
[24:59.640 --> 25:00.800]  City
[25:00.800 --> 25:05.340]  And if that is in fact the the cause I do have that Xfinity
[25:05.960 --> 25:13.780]  It's yeah the same thing Xfinity Wi-Fi and that does sign in I believe on both my phone on my phone and my laptop
[25:14.120 --> 25:17.320]  But this was on a loaner iPhone
[25:17.320 --> 25:24.080]  Which I'd never had been on right that network before right so that that gives me another
[25:24.520 --> 25:26.520]  pause on that I
[25:27.520 --> 25:31.600]  And funny part like part of the backlash of this and like again
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.320]  I think you got a lot of you know
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.800]  I'm sure you like you just said before that you've gotten a lot of you got a lot of feedback from people if you're being
[25:37.800 --> 25:39.600]  unfair to Apple
[25:39.600 --> 25:42.120]  Which I don't see I really don't but you know
[25:42.120 --> 25:44.880]  It's it's not your job to bend over backwards to give it a good review
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.520]  You're supposed to give it an accurate fair review right, but then I got the backlash of
[25:51.520 --> 25:57.440]  Hey groups how come you didn't mention all the connectivity issues with it
[25:57.440 --> 25:59.440]  How come review says you didn't have the problem?
[26:03.080 --> 26:05.080]  Yeah, and that like
[26:05.560 --> 26:11.520]  When I was reviewing it it was funny. I actually was sort of I have bad luck with some products
[26:11.520 --> 26:18.200]  So this would be the third product and you know look I have to say it's a very stressful situation
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.120]  Right you're you're reviewing a product you do want it to work as promised you want to be able to focus on
[26:23.160 --> 26:29.200]  How people should use this thing and you're sort of derailed with this thing just doesn't work properly
[26:30.080 --> 26:36.520]  And I had a similar situation with the surface book. I reviewed the surface book what two years ago
[26:36.520 --> 26:43.440]  Yeah, two years ago this October and I cuz because I couldn't always remember the life situation because you don't sleep through these processes
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.220]  You're just like keep you know
[26:45.220 --> 26:50.320]  You keep going back to the company and tell them what happened and then try to figure out how to best position that through for readers
[26:51.120 --> 26:55.120]  and so I had this problem with the surface book where the surface book just kept restarting and
[26:55.760 --> 26:59.800]  The company kept telling me Microsoft kept telling me no. No, we've never seen this before
[26:59.800 --> 27:04.600]  We've never seen this before and then they sent me another unit and I would have it again and oh
[27:04.600 --> 27:08.240]  That's so weird that this happened to you. It is never we've never seen this before and
[27:09.060 --> 27:09.680]  You know
[27:09.680 --> 27:14.120]  I I did what I did and I reported that story and I said I can't recommend this thing and then it turned out that
[27:14.120 --> 27:18.240]  Lots of people had the surface book problem and surprisingly Microsoft had seen this before
[27:19.280 --> 27:20.220]  and you know
[27:20.220 --> 27:25.360]  we did learn later down the line that there were issues with the Intel chip and the chipset that they were using and
[27:25.600 --> 27:27.600]  graphics and all of that kind of situation
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.760]  And in this case look I I'm very happy to hear that most people are not
[27:32.760 --> 27:34.760]  Experiencing this problem
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.760]  It seems like the the Wi-Fi thing is a is something Apple's gonna fix and I'm happy to hear
[27:41.260 --> 27:43.800]  What I have heard from some readers is that they've had a lot of hard time
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.480]  Initiating the service whether that be through AT&T or t-mobile people have just said like I don't have service on this watch
[27:50.480 --> 27:51.280]  What's wrong with it?
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.300]  And then they say they went back to the carrier and then they're you know, they get it sorted out with Apple and the carrier
[27:56.300 --> 28:04.120]  I had an issue with my review and I felt uncomfortable about that because our review units for the watch
[28:04.640 --> 28:08.480]  Were when they when we Apple handed them to us in our, you know
[28:08.560 --> 28:09.800]  Briefing where they you know
[28:09.800 --> 28:16.040]  Give you the review and you sign the NDA and everything was already paired with the review unit iPhone 8
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.520]  using right an Apple same provided AT&T SIM card and
[28:20.520 --> 28:27.040]  The the part that made me uncomfortable about that. Is that to me? How do you get this set up in the first place?
[28:27.040 --> 28:29.040]  is a huge part of
[28:29.080 --> 28:33.840]  The equation and it's true that you only do it once but to me
[28:33.840 --> 28:37.960]  It's one of those things that it's one of those things that makes Apple products Apple products
[28:38.560 --> 28:41.460]  When they're when they're truly feel like a good Apple product
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.240]  Is that even though you're a seamless setup, right?
[28:45.240 --> 28:50.840]  And even with the packaging even with the the exorbitant expense that they put in their product packaging
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.400]  I think it, you know goes back to Steve Jobs that sure you only open the thing once
[28:54.560 --> 28:59.240]  But you also only get to make a first impression one time and if the first impression is bad
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.760]  You're starting off on the wrong foot
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.040]  So but the fact that I didn't get to review that process made me a little uncomfortable
[29:04.320 --> 29:08.480]  That it was already set up and working but it's it does seem like people are having problems
[29:08.480 --> 29:14.540]  But it also seems to me like I had Apple show me that the process in our in the briefing just as you know
[29:14.540 --> 29:18.040]  Where do you go? Do you have to go to AT&T's website? You have to go to Verizon's website?
[29:18.040 --> 29:22.200]  No, you do it all through the app on your phone and it's you know, boom boom boom
[29:22.200 --> 29:26.680]  And then it should just work and it's like well that seems pretty good, but I wish that I could have done it myself
[29:27.520 --> 29:31.400]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wish I could have tested with my main phone number. That's always a
[29:32.160 --> 29:38.960]  Big I try to test every phone that I test with my my SIM card because there's really you you I mean
[29:39.260 --> 29:43.660]  With iMessage is easier because you get your text messages or you get it through your iMessage account
[29:43.660 --> 29:49.040]  But phone calls and and texts you just you don't get the same amount of that if you're about a spare number
[29:49.540 --> 29:56.300]  Or a loaner number, but um, yeah. No, I mean look this was that was the experience I have other than the LTE issues
[29:56.420 --> 30:00.400]  Look, I loved being untethered from the phone for the for the certain
[30:01.820 --> 30:04.740]  Little experiences I had with it. I think battery life
[30:05.740 --> 30:07.700]  There is only so far you can go with it
[30:07.700 --> 30:13.100]  but that's sort of how Apple has said people will use this thing or they want people to use this thing and
[30:13.100 --> 30:19.740]  Other than that, I mean, it's a good Apple watch you you've I mean it and I
[30:20.740 --> 30:22.860]  Think it makes a difference a significant difference
[30:22.860 --> 30:28.620]  And I think it has with all three generations of Apple watch whether you're wearing the 42 millimeter or the 38
[30:28.620 --> 30:30.420]  I mean and it's just common sense
[30:30.420 --> 30:32.020]  It's like even yeah
[30:32.020 --> 30:37.500]  even the 42 millimeter Apple watch is actually pretty small compared to a lot of other smart watches and
[30:37.500 --> 30:44.460]  Especially now that it has cellular networking. It's like wow, that's really remarkably small for a cellular networking device
[30:44.460 --> 30:52.060]  And the 38 millimeter Apple watch is significantly smaller than 42 millimeter one. So there's it has to be I mean, it's it's not even like a
[30:53.220 --> 30:55.820]  Wow, that sucks. It's like well, of course the battery life
[30:55.820 --> 31:00.540]  It can't be as good and I remember that you had some problems with the first generation one with with
[31:00.540 --> 31:07.420]  The like doing workouts and then coming out of a workout and the battery life was halved. Yeah
[31:07.420 --> 31:13.500]  Because I mean and in any of those cases when you're doing something that's like you're solely relying on the watch for a certain
[31:14.100 --> 31:20.820]  Point you're either tapping for running you're if you're running you're got you're tapping the GPS before there was GPS
[31:20.820 --> 31:25.420]  You were being in and it still is and Apple's done a lot of work to get the battery life down when the heart rate
[31:25.420 --> 31:33.220]  Monitors being tapped and actually it is pretty remarkable now with the real-time heart rate tracking how they've kind of kept the the
[31:33.940 --> 31:35.940]  status quo on the battery life
[31:36.460 --> 31:42.660]  Without the LT on this thing. I really can go now about a day a day and a half. I forgot to charge it I think
[31:44.700 --> 31:51.260]  Yesterday or the night two nights ago and so I had to charge it when I like probably midday through my workday the next day
[31:51.260 --> 31:55.780]  Um, which is look it's that's far better than where we had started
[31:57.100 --> 32:00.060]  But I do look forward to the you know, the series
[32:00.860 --> 32:04.340]  Maybe I mean, I guess what do you think when they have a new version of this?
[32:04.340 --> 32:08.300]  They're gonna stop with the series like what they redesign it fully. Will it be now?
[32:09.100 --> 32:12.140]  I think they like the serious thing. I don't know somehow thing. Yeah
[32:13.020 --> 32:15.700]  Somehow it works for a watch, you know, yeah
[32:15.700 --> 32:18.780]  I think they'll stick with it
[32:18.780 --> 32:24.180]  No, I'm glad to hear that you can get through like I forgot to charge overnight and it's at least it's still not dead the
[32:24.180 --> 32:27.900]  Next morning, so you have a chance, right? That's actually I didn't work out that day
[32:27.900 --> 32:28.380]  You know
[32:28.380 --> 32:33.000]  I didn't like use the GPS or anything along those lines and I also find when I'm working out more I keep the screen on
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  More because I'm looking down at it
[32:35.940 --> 32:37.580]  So
[32:37.580 --> 32:42.100]  Yeah, I I I fully recommend the non LTE version
[32:42.100 --> 32:47.540]  I'm looking forward to getting a this update so I can recommend the LTE version
[32:48.860 --> 32:52.740]  And again, like I I know that many reviewers have not had the problem
[32:52.740 --> 32:56.740]  I know many customers about has not had the problem, but I've had the problem. Yeah, that's all I can
[32:56.740 --> 32:58.740]  That's all I can speak to
[33:00.180 --> 33:03.900]  Just bad luck, I don't know I've I've had really good luck with it
[33:03.900 --> 33:08.380]  I last night we went out to eat at a really really noisy restaurant like so noisy
[33:08.380 --> 33:14.220]  That me and Amy and Jonas actually like when we first got seated. We were like, why do we come here?
[33:14.220 --> 33:16.980]  This is too noisy like that noisy and I thought well
[33:16.980 --> 33:21.060]  this would be a good test of the watch and and I brought my personal phone, but
[33:21.580 --> 33:26.740]  Wearing that my still wearing my review unit watch, but I'd left the phone that it's paired with at home
[33:26.740 --> 33:33.020]  so it was on cellular and I dictated a text to Jonas right there on the watch and
[33:33.020 --> 33:40.140]  And Siri was fast. It got the entire sentence completely accurate and it just worked in a very noisy restaurant
[33:40.140 --> 33:43.540]  So I have to say I've been totally I've been really I noticed that too
[33:43.540 --> 33:46.700]  I noticed that too and I had that in my review
[33:46.700 --> 33:50.580]  I mean when this thing was working Siri was really fast the text on
[33:50.800 --> 33:56.780]  You know just voice to text for texting was super fast because I did really try and live with it alone for the day
[33:57.500 --> 33:58.580]  and
[33:58.580 --> 34:05.180]  The best way to input text on this thing is with your voice. It's just hands down. I mean the the little sketch thing is just
[34:05.660 --> 34:08.780]  Just terrible, you know Jonas is really good at that though
[34:09.780 --> 34:14.180]  He loves that little thing where he writes his responses. It's and he's good
[34:14.180 --> 34:16.940]  I think I don't know if it's cuz his fingers are still small or what?
[34:16.940 --> 34:23.380]  But I think it is that and also like being able to hit the little like if you need to delete the delete button
[34:23.540 --> 34:25.860]  Like go back. Yeah, so small
[34:25.860 --> 34:30.560]  It's like it is it is like small. Yeah, it is so small. I'm looking at it right now
[34:32.220 --> 34:37.560]  I'll tell you what the other thing before we leave the watch reviews is that you you so you took a jet-ski ride out on
[34:37.560 --> 34:39.560]  the Hudson
[34:40.100 --> 34:42.940]  Nicole McGowan who reviews these things for BuzzFeed
[34:43.060 --> 34:48.740]  She swam like a thousand meters out into the San Francisco Bay and then placed a phone call
[34:49.380 --> 34:51.220]  out there I
[34:51.220 --> 34:56.420]  You two made me feel so lazy like where my testing of the cellular was. I went to get coffee. I
[34:57.640 --> 34:59.220]  mean look
[34:59.220 --> 35:01.300]  That is a little bit more practical
[35:02.540 --> 35:06.260]  You know, I volunteered to walk to pick Jonas up from school
[35:06.700 --> 35:12.940]  So that the marketing tagline the marketing tagline I got this in the email yesterday from Apple
[35:12.940 --> 35:16.380]  You know telling you this is on sale is make a call from your surfboard
[35:16.380 --> 35:20.900]  So, you know and and Lauren good actually did she's a surfer
[35:21.420 --> 35:25.380]  She did do that, which I was very impressed with I mean
[35:26.100 --> 35:28.460]  But yeah, you know you want to take these things to that
[35:28.460 --> 35:29.220]  You want to you know?
[35:29.220 --> 35:31.660]  I want to put my apples marketing claims to the test and
[35:31.980 --> 35:37.340]  That was one of the reasons I wanted to live with the thing for the day was when I was sitting in the keynote
[35:37.340 --> 35:40.500]  I is it Jeff Williams Jeff? Yep
[35:40.500 --> 35:46.920]  he said and that's how I started my video you can live with just this watch and no phone and
[35:47.400 --> 35:53.000]  He didn't mean it like forever, but that's what I heard like in this in the contents of his sentence
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.280]  so that's why I wanted to live the whole day with just the watch and
[35:58.020 --> 36:02.480]  Yeah, I also went on that trapeze which was just the the craziest thing I've ever done for work
[36:04.260 --> 36:07.540]  Did you make it to the end of the video did anyone make it to the end of the video I
[36:07.540 --> 36:09.420]  I
[36:09.420 --> 36:15.540]  For some reason I was thinking trying to think of ways. How will I get my heart rate up without really moving?
[36:16.580 --> 36:22.420]  You know because that's one of the things that like I was I'm really impressed by that and actually as someone who has like some
[36:22.420 --> 36:27.180]  Anxiety disorders. I was like that kind of spoke to me during the presentation where they said, you know
[36:27.180 --> 36:32.060]  People have found that when they look down at their watch and they're there they're feeling anxious and their heart rate is up
[36:32.060 --> 36:38.900]  It's comforting to know that it that it is that's that is the real biological function that's happening or or the the real affect
[36:38.900 --> 36:40.900]  and so I was like, how can I make my
[36:41.260 --> 36:45.580]  Heart rate go up, but I won't be moving and I was like, oh Heights
[36:45.580 --> 36:51.660]  I'm so scared of Heights and so I forget who might have been sitting with me or I just was like
[36:51.660 --> 36:53.660]  what about a trapeze and
[36:54.060 --> 37:00.940]  Then I just did that but it didn't work because I had actually climbed up the ladder which if the watch cinches motion
[37:00.940 --> 37:02.940]  it doesn't think that there's
[37:03.140 --> 37:05.900]  Anyway, but my heart rate did hit a hundred and fifty sevens, right?
[37:05.900 --> 37:09.420]  it's like it makes the assumption that you're you know, and now that it has the
[37:10.820 --> 37:16.260]  Barometric thing so we can tell that you're going up right it because like the altimeter
[37:16.260 --> 37:16.620]  Yeah
[37:16.620 --> 37:21.780]  it just assumes that you're like going up a set of stairs or a ladder with like a heavy backpack on or something and that's
[37:21.780 --> 37:26.740]  why your heart rate is accelerating but anyway, there's a you have a dedication to your craft that I salute because I
[37:26.740 --> 37:32.580]  I also made for a great video, but I met and people like oh wow, you cut in that sound effect
[37:32.580 --> 37:34.580]  I'm like, no, that was me
[37:39.540 --> 37:44.340]  The worst scream I've ever like my wife is like I've never heard anything like that come out of you
[37:44.340 --> 37:49.220]  I was like, yeah, I have I have it's your fear of heights. I it's not like, you know, I
[37:50.740 --> 37:55.500]  don't know it doesn't it doesn't really affect me very often, but I don't like getting close to an edge and and
[37:55.500 --> 37:59.820]  If I watch somebody doing something like that my palms start sweating
[38:00.980 --> 38:06.060]  there's a one of the Mission Impossible movies opens with Tom Cruise rock climbing and
[38:07.460 --> 38:10.580]  It's oh, yeah. I think it's the one that John Woo directed
[38:10.580 --> 38:15.740]  I forget which one but it's it's like he's free climb eating. Oh, he has no safety harness on of course. It's a freaking movie
[38:15.740 --> 38:18.620]  It's a fictional movie and I know that he's not going to you know
[38:18.620 --> 38:22.180]  The Mission Impossible movie is not going to open with Tom Cruise plummeting to his death
[38:22.180 --> 38:27.160]  But when I watch it my palms get so wet and and it amuses
[38:27.420 --> 38:32.500]  Jonas to no end like I'm like here feel and it's it's it feels like I dip my hands in water
[38:33.820 --> 38:36.020]  I can't I just you know, there's a similar scene
[38:37.060 --> 38:39.060]  And I feel the same but it's Ace Ventura
[38:39.780 --> 38:45.700]  To when nature calls and he's like on to the cliffhanger. He's like he's like it's like a cliffhanger scene
[38:46.340 --> 38:50.980]  You know the Mission Impossible one seemed to go back to it because there's another one reason in that skyscraper in Dubai
[38:50.980 --> 38:53.300]  And he's hanging on the outside of the building
[38:53.300 --> 38:58.980]  And again, my palms just I could just cut my hands together and get like a cup of sweat. I
[38:59.500 --> 39:01.500]  Can't help it. It's involuntary
[39:01.940 --> 39:04.860]  But it also means that I'm now googling this Ace Ventura
[39:05.660 --> 39:10.780]  if I was ever hanging like that by my hands, I would have no chance of holding on because
[39:11.900 --> 39:14.860]  and sort of immediately just slick up and I would just
[39:16.580 --> 39:19.180]  Yeah, yeah, no, I mean I
[39:19.180 --> 39:26.900]  I I probably wouldn't have like jumped off that trapeze or whatever they say glide off of it, but I just jumped
[39:27.780 --> 39:31.480]  If I hadn't been doing it for like if there hadn't been two cameras on me
[39:31.480 --> 39:35.740]  I was like it will be mortifying if I if people at work think I didn't actually do this
[39:35.740 --> 39:41.300]  So you make these videos with a rig you got like a helmet rig sort of or is it more of is it a helmet?
[39:41.300 --> 39:43.420]  or just like a headband that mounts a
[39:43.420 --> 39:48.900]  a camera to your like forehead so for the for the go for the jet ski and the
[39:49.820 --> 39:51.940]  Trapeze, it was a GoPro, you know
[39:51.940 --> 39:56.780]  Just a head mat ahead a headband thing the head mount thing and then for the other scenes
[39:56.900 --> 40:03.460]  Because I do like to shoot with a nicer camera. We have a nice Sony that we put on a on a hockey helmet
[40:06.140 --> 40:08.920]  Yeah, I mean and I love so I you know
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.280]  I did this for that my first time with the first Apple watch video and now I've sort of just made it into a
[40:13.280 --> 40:15.220]  series because it's actually
[40:15.220 --> 40:21.820]  one it's it's a really fun way of making videos and sort of giving people a real first-person perspective of
[40:22.580 --> 40:28.180]  How you how you'd use these things in everyday life now granted. I realize that you in everyday life
[40:28.180 --> 40:30.180]  you don't go jet skiing in the Hudson or
[40:30.780 --> 40:32.220]  trapeze, but
[40:32.220 --> 40:36.980]  So I just like it as like as a way to show that and then also like it gives me the ability to sort of
[40:36.980 --> 40:37.700]  voice
[40:37.700 --> 40:44.260]  like these normal everyday occurrences or how you would use it versus sort of just talk to the camera or talk to the viewer and
[40:44.260 --> 40:48.560]  Say this is the watch and this is you know, what I thought of it here and this is what I thought of it here
[40:49.640 --> 40:52.980]  so yeah, I've always just I've now loved this dial and it's
[40:53.620 --> 40:57.940]  It seems to be something people like a lot of people complain about my voice in it, but I don't know
[40:57.940 --> 41:01.220]  This is my voice. I like it. All right, let me take a break here. Thank
[41:01.220 --> 41:08.660]  Thank our next sponsor. It's it's away now away is a company that makes high-quality
[41:09.780 --> 41:11.580]  luggage
[41:11.580 --> 41:13.180]  They use great materials
[41:13.180 --> 41:18.500]  But they offer a much lower price compared to other brands because they cut out the middleman and sell direct to you
[41:18.740 --> 41:20.740]  they've got nine colors and
[41:20.900 --> 41:25.120]  four sizes the carry-on the bigger carry-on the medium the large I
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.720]  I love the names even they don't screw around none of this nonsense about Grande and
[41:31.240 --> 41:33.740]  Venti and all that crap just you know
[41:33.740 --> 41:37.980]  The names tell you exactly how big they are the carry-on the bigger carry-on the medium the large
[41:38.780 --> 41:42.060]  Their suitcases are made with premium German polycarbonate
[41:42.540 --> 41:49.500]  Unrivaled in strength and impact resistance very lightweight their interiors have a patent pendant pending compression system
[41:49.500 --> 41:56.460]  Helpful for over packers I can verify this because I like to go if I can I like to travel even if it's like for
[41:56.460 --> 42:01.240]  a week with just one carry-on so I don't have to wait for luggage and I've got one of these and I just stuff it
[42:01.240 --> 42:03.060]  full of stuff and a
[42:03.060 --> 42:09.680]  Lot of times like for example, we got so much stuff to review in San Francisco last week
[42:10.340 --> 42:14.000]  We got two phones Apple watch Apple TV
[42:14.000 --> 42:20.320]  That it gave us HDMI cable. So everything I packed I had to take home and then I had to throw all that stuff in
[42:20.320 --> 42:21.960]  the suitcase to
[42:21.960 --> 42:26.920]  Work perfectly. It's really great. They give you a little bag. I love this. It's so so smart
[42:26.920 --> 42:28.960]  I don't even know it's kind of gross thinking
[42:28.960 --> 42:33.400]  How did I pack without one of these but they have a little bag built in where you can put your dirty clothes to?
[42:33.400 --> 42:35.840]  Separate it so that when you come back your dirty clothes aren't
[42:36.760 --> 42:40.980]  Rattling around in there with your whatever clean clothes you have left or whatever other stuff you have packed
[42:40.980 --> 42:42.860]  and
[42:42.860 --> 42:49.060]  Here's the killer feature. This is truly killer. Is that each one of these things the carry-ons at least come with a built-in?
[42:49.780 --> 42:51.620]  USB battery charger
[42:51.620 --> 42:53.460]  so and as a
[42:53.460 --> 43:00.560]  Huge huge like two thousand or twenty thousand milliamps so you can charge two devices at once you can charge your phone like a whole
[43:00.560 --> 43:01.900]  bunch of times and
[43:01.900 --> 43:05.580]  So when you're sitting there at the gate waiting for your flight
[43:05.580 --> 43:11.620]  You don't have to look for one of like the two lucky seats that are near like an outlet or a USB port or something
[43:11.620 --> 43:17.260]  Like that you could just take any seat that's open and then just plug your phone in to your suitcase and get a charge
[43:17.260 --> 43:19.260]  It's absolutely terrific
[43:19.260 --> 43:21.260]  I personally find that
[43:21.660 --> 43:27.420]  Airports still have such spotty cell coverage that my phone when it on days when I travel it just seems like my phone drops
[43:27.600 --> 43:32.540]  20% from when I first get to the airport to when I get to the gate let alone
[43:32.540 --> 43:36.220]  Whatever whatever dicking around on the internet I do when I'm at the gate
[43:37.260 --> 43:38.260]  And so it's great
[43:38.260 --> 43:43.520]  It's just such a convenient place to have a battery charger and then it's just like one last thing you need to worry about keeping
[43:43.520 --> 43:48.220]  In your pockets and if you ever travel with like a portable battery charger or something like that, it's a terrific feature
[43:49.300 --> 43:54.260]  One more thing. You also need to charge though. Yeah, so you do you do need to remember once in a while
[43:54.260 --> 43:56.260]  I don't need to remember to charge your luggage
[43:57.260 --> 44:00.320]  But I charge mine like I don't know like like one
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.280]  Yeah, we have it like once or twice a year or like maybe I get home and I think well
[44:04.280 --> 44:06.680]  I'll just charge it, you know while I unpack or something like that
[44:06.680 --> 44:10.840]  I did the battery in the suitcase is so big that you don't really need to remember to charge it very often
[44:11.400 --> 44:15.640]  Does it eat into the size of the suitcase? No, not at all. You would never know that
[44:15.640 --> 44:20.040]  Yeah, you would never know that there's a these are very nice bags there. They really are
[44:20.480 --> 44:22.440]  I've been using one for a while the wheels
[44:22.440 --> 44:25.200]  I'll just verify that the wheels on mine have held up
[44:25.200 --> 44:29.920]  I must be have mine must be over a year old by now and I've taken it on every single trip
[44:29.920 --> 44:33.640]  I've taken since I got it and the wheels are just terrific
[44:34.840 --> 44:40.440]  And if you've never had one of these suitcases like the old way of travel bag had like two wheels and you have to pull
[44:40.440 --> 44:44.560]  It behind you but the new way is to have four wheels so you can just kind of like push it along
[44:46.080 --> 44:51.600]  It's just rolls like a dream which is a big deal for me because I used to have a one that squeaked
[44:51.760 --> 44:57.120]  As I went down the airport, so it was a huge upgrade for me versus the ratty old suitcase
[44:57.120 --> 45:01.240]  I used to have so here's where you go to find out more away travel.com

[45:25.040 --> 45:28.720]  I don't think I have any stickers or if I do I don't know what I did with them

[45:48.720 --> 45:52.600]  well, the the theory is my theory is our theory is a
[45:52.600 --> 45:56.640]  A they get beaten up anyway, but be if you get like a nice black one

[46:06.680 --> 46:12.240]  It's not from away it's it's some other, you know, just a dumb suitcase not a smart suitcase, but we picked like this
[46:12.760 --> 46:14.760]  garish purple color
[46:15.400 --> 46:21.120]  And every time we travel somebody else has the exact same suitcase, it's yeah. Yeah because they're thinking the same thing

[47:03.180 --> 47:04.780]  Spoiler

[47:09.000 --> 47:12.600]  I I have before we get on to more like recent tech stuff
[47:12.600 --> 47:17.560]  Let me just take it will take like there's like a half half time and I'm gonna do some follow-up here on
[47:17.680 --> 47:20.160]  Clear up some issues from previous episodes of the show
[47:21.800 --> 47:25.360]  Number one, I've been talking about noumeno cookies ever had a noumeno cookie
[47:26.480 --> 47:27.560]  No
[47:27.560 --> 47:34.440]  Have I I don't know noumenos are Paul the Paul Newman snack food company's version of Oreos and they're the best
[47:34.560 --> 47:41.760]  Oreo type cookies you're ever gonna have because the the the the and and and it has came up a couple episodes ago
[47:41.760 --> 47:44.480]  I forget if it was with Jason Snell or who but
[47:48.160 --> 47:53.520]  Oreo like cookies get a bad rap because all the all the fake Oreo cookies to me
[47:53.520 --> 47:57.960]  I've always tasted terrible in life never as good as a real Oreo and I think and and
[47:58.200 --> 48:03.500]  and this has turned into a sensation on my Twitter feed with people going out and buying noumenos and it's
[48:04.280 --> 48:10.320]  Unbelievable. I I stand by the fact that the noumeno is a superior cookie to an Oreo and you've just read the ingredients
[48:10.320 --> 48:12.320]  You can see it that it's it's like real sugar
[48:12.360 --> 48:18.180]  not the partially hydrogenized corn oil or whatever the other crap is like real chocolate like the
[48:18.640 --> 48:25.180]  Chocolate wafers actually taste like chocolate and the cream filling in the middle actually tastes like cream instead of just like
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.400]  Just pure sugar into a paste
[48:28.080 --> 48:35.440]  It's just overwhelming to me. How many people out there listeners of the show are going out buying the noumenos and it's unbelievable
[48:35.440 --> 48:41.600]  It's like something like I would say at least 95% of the feedback at least 19 out of every 20 responses is wow
[48:41.600 --> 48:43.800]  You're right. These are way better than Oreos
[48:43.800 --> 48:48.720]  And of course, you're not gonna get a hundred percent, but I I didn't even think it would be that high. I really didn't
[48:49.360 --> 48:52.960]  So anyway, am I thanks. I gotta buy him now. Yeah, you got to get noumenos
[48:52.960 --> 48:56.880]  Just get the regular like the regular ones that I'm looking on the website now
[48:56.880 --> 48:59.560]  I don't you know, you don't suggest the ginger ones
[48:59.560 --> 49:05.940]  Well, I like the ginger ones, but you gotta like ginger about Hinto mint. I like those two I do
[49:06.040 --> 49:08.600]  But it's the standard Newman butter noumenos
[49:08.600 --> 49:08.960]  Oh
[49:08.960 --> 49:14.080]  and I will say this my son and I conducted a test and here's the one it this is part of the follow-up is a
[49:14.080 --> 49:20.080]  Lot of people said hey, what about Trader Joe's Joe Joe's now Trader Joe's has a yeah
[49:20.360 --> 49:26.780]  They're in-house brand and there were some people who speculated that maybe Trader Joe's Joe Joe's were just rebranded noumenos
[49:26.780 --> 49:31.140]  I can do that. Nope. We did a blind taste test here in the house
[49:31.700 --> 49:33.700]  conducted by my wife
[49:33.820 --> 49:35.060]  she
[49:35.060 --> 49:37.120]  And my she didn't want to eat him
[49:37.120 --> 49:42.060]  but so my son and I both blind test tested noumenos side by side with Joe Joe's and
[49:42.460 --> 49:48.060]  Both a clearly not the same cookie and B both of us agreed that the noumeno is a superior cookie
[49:48.060 --> 49:54.680]  I I'm more concerned about these other options from Newman's cookies. Have you seen these orange chocolate chip cookies?
[49:54.680 --> 49:57.960]  No, I have not. I although I'd have it orange
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.880]  Mmm, I don't know about that. I love Newman's. I love Newman's own. I
[50:03.520 --> 50:05.520]  Every night I drink Newman's own
[50:06.520 --> 50:10.460]  Lemonade. Oh, that's good. Sometimes the half a nap, but I have the lemonade every night
[50:10.460 --> 50:12.460]  Yeah, you got to get the new man usually with vodka
[50:15.440 --> 50:17.440]  Well, I mean
[50:17.960 --> 50:19.800]  Animal
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.280]  exactly
[50:21.280 --> 50:26.680]  Got to get the noumenos jet Joanna. I'm telling I'm going to there's no way I'm not gonna get the noumenos now
[50:26.680 --> 50:33.200]  I'm getting them. I I will say just goes back to the the free shipping free overnight shipping with the Eros
[50:33.360 --> 50:38.380]  I believe people outside the United States might have a hard time getting their hands on noumenos
[50:38.380 --> 50:42.340]  There were some people in Europe who tweeted some pictures where when they tried to order them from Amazon
[50:42.440 --> 50:48.180]  They were like $30 a package. They're not worth $30 a package if you can't get them at a
[50:48.880 --> 50:50.880]  You know reasonable
[50:50.880 --> 50:54.180]  Package of cookies price it you're not missing out that much
[50:54.640 --> 50:56.840]  Here's the one that you're gonna like you're gonna like this
[50:56.840 --> 51:00.560]  So a couple episodes ago with Jason Snell
[51:00.560 --> 51:03.880]  I was talking about a very clever cable that I bought from
[51:04.280 --> 51:07.880]  Belkin now it was expensive because I got like an idiot. I bought it at the Apple Store
[51:07.880 --> 51:10.440]  So it was like $29, but it's like a nice long
[51:11.040 --> 51:15.280]  Are we gonna be talking about dongles? I feel like every time I come on this podcast we talked about goals
[51:15.280 --> 51:17.280]  It is so it is sort of a dongle it
[51:17.280 --> 51:19.200]  You
[51:19.200 --> 51:23.040]  Let me describe this. I'm excited. I've started to cut you off. Yeah, you tell me if it's a dongle
[51:23.080 --> 51:25.160]  It's a USB a on one end
[51:25.160 --> 51:29.320]  So it's just like the standard old-school USB thing and on the other end
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.940]  It's micro micro USB, but with a little lightning
[51:34.520 --> 51:40.760]  Condom that is connected by a little so I know it right and so I know this
[51:40.760 --> 51:48.240]  And it's it's a game changer for me because I still I hate micro USB. It's a three-way, right?
[51:48.240 --> 51:52.660]  Well, no, no, it's two-way, but all these people a whole bunch of readers sent me
[51:52.660 --> 51:56.720]  I will put this link in the show notes. I've got it right here. But at the end of the cable, there's a three-way
[51:56.720 --> 52:01.840]  No, it's only two the one I was talking about is only lightning but the new one from Monoprice
[52:01.840 --> 52:04.720]  This is the one I want to talk about. I'm gonna put this link in the show notes
[52:04.720 --> 52:10.320]  It's a three-way cable from Monoprice now remember Monoprice. We've talked about them before like they make great cables
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.260]  What's so special about yours? Well, it was just saved me one cable
[52:14.260 --> 52:20.800]  So instead of I instead of taking having a micro USB cable in my backpack just for charging things like
[52:21.440 --> 52:27.220]  One way. Okay. I got you. I got you, right, but don't buy that to anybody it anybody went out and bought that on my recommendation
[52:27.220 --> 52:33.440]  I apologize because what you really want is the new three-way cable from Monoprice, which is one cable that does micro USB
[52:33.440 --> 52:40.940]  USB C and lightning all on one cable and so all you never have to worry if you have this cable
[52:41.060 --> 52:44.880]  You could charge anything and everything you could charge your Wii or not
[52:44.880 --> 52:51.440]  We what's it called the the new Nintendo thing the Nintendo switch you could charge an external battery pack that takes micro USB
[52:51.440 --> 52:56.920]  And then there's a little lightning one you pop on and and there it looks a little ugly almost like a like a trident
[52:56.920 --> 53:02.980]  Because it's got two of these little caps to switch, you know tip tip, you know it
[53:03.720 --> 53:08.460]  But it's a fantastic cable and at Monoprice. It's super cheap. I forget what it is. It's like, you know
[53:08.460 --> 53:10.300]  I'm gonna write an I'm gonna write another story
[53:10.300 --> 53:14.280]  I haven't been writing much lately, but I I'm gonna write another story about charging
[53:14.800 --> 53:16.040]  $9.99
[53:16.040 --> 53:18.900]  You've now convinced me this this cable
[53:18.900 --> 53:24.180]  This is what I was picturing because I got almost the same exact pitch from a company this morning
[53:24.180 --> 53:26.080]  as
[53:26.080 --> 53:28.780]  This it's but it's a different company that makes this
[53:30.240 --> 53:36.820]  It's not the Monoprice one, but it's almost it's it it actually looks like a little bit like a higher quality fabric cable
[53:37.320 --> 53:40.200]  You know, they have like the the fabric cords
[53:41.400 --> 53:46.400]  Okay, that's what that's what we talked about the last time to the anchor one has the fabric on it
[53:46.760 --> 53:50.640]  No, they make a cable anchor makes a cable. Is it anchor or anchor? I
[53:50.640 --> 53:57.200]  Don't know. I always say on car now really I've I'd go with anchor but with my with my history of pronunciation
[53:57.720 --> 53:59.720]  I have no idea
[53:59.720 --> 54:02.440]  You know, I had the same conversation a number of months back
[54:02.440 --> 54:06.900]  I was interviewed by a reporter at the verge who was doing a story on anchor and because I
[54:07.160 --> 54:10.980]  Basically become known as an anchor fangirl. I they interviewed me about it
[54:11.720 --> 54:14.040]  And I kept saying on car I think
[54:14.560 --> 54:17.880]  Well, it's funny you would bring them up because my next bit of follow-up
[54:17.880 --> 54:23.000]  Is is on they a sponsor? No, they are not a sponsor, but they have a 31
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.880]  Well, actually actually, let me let me hold off on that on the anchor thing, but I'll go to this
[54:27.880 --> 54:29.280]  There's panzerina and I last week
[54:29.280 --> 54:35.560]  We're talking about Apple's new sport straps that have like a velcro like enclosure or clasp or something like that
[54:35.560 --> 54:41.040]  And I speculated idly. Hey, can you just call that stuff velcro or is that a trademark or
[54:41.700 --> 54:44.680]  What's the deal and turns out I was exactly right?
[54:44.680 --> 54:51.560]  It's exactly like Kleenex or using Kleenex to describe facial tissue or Clorox to talk about bleach. It is a trademark
[54:52.200 --> 54:54.360]  And I got an email from a reader
[54:55.440 --> 55:02.800]  Or a listener, I should say that was very very interesting and he happens to know somebody who is a hook and
[55:03.200 --> 55:05.960]  They it's like they want you to call him hooking
[55:06.480 --> 55:11.380]  Clasp what they what they want you to call the generic version of velcro is ridiculous
[55:11.380 --> 55:17.120]  It's like hook and clasp or something like that, but he's an engineer who works on that stuff for the velcro corporation
[55:17.120 --> 55:24.880]  And apparently they did work with Apple on this band. It actually is like the most advanced hook and clasp material
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.200]  available in the world today because it's it's the
[55:28.680 --> 55:32.640]  thing that's neat about it is you can kind of tell just by looking at it that you could use it for months and
[55:32.640 --> 55:34.300]  months and it's the
[55:34.300 --> 55:40.500]  The hook part isn't going to get which is the soft part isn't going to get fuzzy the way that like
[55:40.500 --> 55:42.500]  cheap versions of this will
[55:42.820 --> 55:49.620]  But that they don't want you to call it velcro in this case because I guess Apple isn't licensing the velcro
[55:49.860 --> 55:55.160]  Trademark, even though they did work with the velcro corporation to develop these bands
[55:56.100 --> 55:59.620]  But anyway, the most funny thing and it here is I'm going to put it in the show notes
[56:00.500 --> 56:07.340]  The velcro company put out the most cringe-worthy YouTube video I have ever seen in my entire life
[56:07.340 --> 56:09.460]  It is it is employees of the company
[56:09.460 --> 56:11.460]  I
[56:11.700 --> 56:15.700]  Don't play this now because you're not it's gonna wreck you play it when the show is over Joanna
[56:16.340 --> 56:17.460]  Okay
[56:17.460 --> 56:20.300]  It is it is a song called don't say
[56:20.300 --> 56:22.300]  Now
[56:37.500 --> 56:39.700]  Not only is it a cringe-worthy song
[56:39.700 --> 56:45.220]  But I really do believe that they picked actual employees of the company because they can't carry a tune
[56:45.220 --> 56:53.780]  I can't wait to watch it. So anyway, don't don't call it velcro, but it is indeed advanced
[56:54.580 --> 56:56.980]  engineered hooking clasp, whatever
[56:58.780 --> 57:04.200]  Closure that Apple worked with in coordination with the velcro company even though they're not calling it velcro
[57:04.200 --> 57:07.460]  So anyway, that's a bit of follow-up and then I actually love that band
[57:07.460 --> 57:12.260]  I had to cut that out of my video since getting too long, but I love that band which band oh that strap
[57:12.260 --> 57:17.440]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's trap. Sorry. Yeah, I love the band's the velcro. Don't say the velcro
[57:21.340 --> 57:28.580]  Sorry, yes the watch band yeah, I could see how it's gonna be a super popular watch band because it is
[57:29.060 --> 57:35.520]  Again, I don't think I'm a velcro guy, but especially for workouts. It really is like it's super lightweight
[57:35.540 --> 57:41.140]  It's super soft and I think it's gonna get that as the standard which is I think the same price
[57:41.140 --> 57:44.300]  If you if you buy it on Apple's site
[57:44.300 --> 57:51.420]  I think that if you just buy the the series 3 or the series 2 with that band is the same starting price
[57:51.780 --> 57:57.140]  Yeah, and I like a lot of people I find their their standard sport strap
[57:57.140 --> 58:02.660]  I think it's really fascinating and I I've got some from the original Apple watch and I've worn them over and over
[58:02.660 --> 58:06.960]  I don't spend a lot of time with them, but I know some people who do and it is amazing
[58:06.960 --> 58:11.300]  They're their original sports strap the rubbery one. It's incredibly durable
[58:11.300 --> 58:15.380]  Like you would think maybe the hole the hole that you poke it through would wear through or something like that
[58:16.260 --> 58:17.380]  It's amazing Joe
[58:17.380 --> 58:22.740]  so Jonah my son Jonas has one he has a red sports strap on his Apple watch and he got an Apple watch way back when
[58:22.740 --> 58:27.000]  It was a new thing and I've looked at it in his sports strap
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.180]  It's it's a little dirty like the red isn't quite it. It doesn't look brand new, but it doesn't look gross
[58:32.180 --> 58:34.580]  it just looks a little like it, you know, like something that
[58:34.580 --> 58:38.860]  The 11 12 13 year old kid has worn almost every day for a while
[58:38.940 --> 58:42.760]  but like the hole that he pokes it through is is as good as the
[58:42.820 --> 58:48.200]  Like next as any other hole like the ones that he's never used so like the durability on that is amazing
[58:48.200 --> 58:50.660]  But I like a lot of people I find that it's a little sweaty
[58:50.660 --> 58:54.020]  I find that my it's like my my wrist reacts to that rubber
[58:54.740 --> 58:58.060]  And I also don't find it intuitive to put on I'm sorry
[58:58.060 --> 59:03.420]  But like whenever I get my nails done and it's like I had to take my watch off and someone has to put this thing
[59:03.420 --> 59:05.420]  Back on me. No one knows how to put it on
[59:06.300 --> 59:11.180]  Once you know it you you you know, yeah, one two three on yeah
[59:11.180 --> 59:15.320]  That's why I like the the new non velcro, whatever it's called. Yeah
[59:15.840 --> 59:18.180]  Yeah, same price. I'm looking on the website. Yeah
[59:18.700 --> 59:22.640]  Yeah, I mean it could get dirty though. Yes to your point. The other one's more durable
[59:22.640 --> 59:28.380]  It's like the velcro version of the Milanese loop with the magnetic thing, which is so so super easy to
[59:28.380 --> 59:35.220]  Get on and off but unlike the magnetic one doesn't doesn't when you flex your wrist doesn't like get a little looser
[59:36.660 --> 59:41.420]  Yeah, no, it's a good fit. Yeah, I like that too. I didn't really write too much about it in my review either
[59:41.420 --> 59:43.420]  But it's it's really good. Yeah
[59:45.140 --> 59:50.680]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our next sponsor which has already been spoiled by somebody
[59:52.140 --> 59:57.080]  Fracture fractures the photo decor company and they're out to rescue your favorite images from the digital ether
[59:57.080 --> 01:00:03.860]  They print your photos directly on glass and add a laser cut rigid backing. So they're ready to display right out of the box
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.780]  This is literally edge to edge
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:11.620]  It's like a fracture print is like where cell phones are going like, you know
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.580]  You could talk about like the reduced bezels on today's cell phones, but they're not really edge to edge
[01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.900]  Like that's the thing like with the iPhone 10
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.500]  it's it's certainly far closer to edge to edge than anything Apple's ever done and
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.740]  Arguably with the reduction of the chin and forehead closer to edge to edge than any other phone on the market
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.740]  But it's not edge to edge. There is a bezel
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:38.700]  Fracture prints come out and it's literally just a piece of glass that is edge to edge your photo. It looks so amazing
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.980]  It looks futuristic
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.700]  It's it's it's not digital. It's not electronic
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:47.660]  It's an analog print of a photo printed directly on glass that you hang on a wall put it on your desk put on your
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:53.780]  Mantle, whatever but it kind of looks futuristic because it just there's there is no frame. It's it's really really a great
[01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:58.320]  Look, it puts all the focus on your photos and there's a really really high quality
[01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.620]  printing
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.060]  Everything that you get from them comes with they call a 60-day happiness guarantee
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.780]  So you have 60 days and if you don't like it, they'll give you your money back and every fracture is handmade in
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:17.020]  Gainesville, Florida from US sourced materials in a carbon neutral factory so you can feel good about that

[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.040]  Taking a lot of pictures of your son. I
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:51.880]  Am I am so I well I actually this way because I was working so hard on the the series 3 review
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.140]  I hadn't really been using the 8 plus that much because
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.400]  Because I was using my other iPhone with the that wasn't the one that was paired with my watch
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.920]  So I started using the 8 plus a lot to play with the studio lighting in his head. It's very funny
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.600]  And then when he was born I bought
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.400]  This Sony camera, which is a which I'm obsessed with. It's the rx100
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.960]  Yeah, so I'm I mean most of the photos I've taken with him
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.440]  I mean I take a lot on my phone, but most I've taken on this camera
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.680]  Which I just like it's just great to not have a phone with you sometimes
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.800]  So, yeah, it's funny it's so Jonas was born in 2004 and in 2004
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.240]  My nice camera was still it was a Canon SLR shooting 35 millimeter film. Oh
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:43.960]  Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I guess so. And so what I used to do is shoot
[01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:49.920]  You know rolls of film and then when I got them developed I would have the photo place
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.100]  They got the prints made put them on a CD
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.280]  But they're like in hindsight. I mean, they're not bad
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.040]  I they're good photos because it was a great camera and almost all shot with a 50 millimeter prime lens
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.000]  And so they're in in a certain sense
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.360]  They're very they're really nice
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.520]  But the the scans that they gave me are so ridiculously low-res like megapixel wise it's criminal
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.360]  They're like, I don't know like 10 24 by 768 or something like that. I don't know
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:21.840]  So there's a part, you know in times of like what what kind of pictures I could be taking now if he was born
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:27.640]  It's it's you know, it's kind of seems like a he's only 13, but seems like not that old but it's like wow
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.960]  It's like photo wise it's ridiculous. And then the other thing is right before he was born
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.920]  He was born in January and for Christmas. My mother-in-law got me or got us as a family gift that
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.440]  She said whatever video camera you want me to get so I picked it out. She'd you know got like a Panasonic mini DV
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.080]  Right, right. And I thought I thought this is great. It's shooting digital
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.360]  On mini DV tapes, but it's standard definition
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.440]  And and the camera was just humongous. Did you ever convert them? I've convert, you know, here's the stupid thing
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.800]  I converted half of them and I thought I there was a place here in town and it was kind of expensive
[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:11.400]  But I thought well now I'm only gonna do half because what if I don't like the results and I did half and the results
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.240]  were
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.160]  Good, you know as good as I had hoped and then I've just never gotten around to going back to get the second half done
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.640]  Like I still have them I should use this as a kick in the pants to go do it
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.360]  But I have half of the right digitized and you know, it's not bad. It certainly blows away anything
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.640]  You know, there's like there's like three minutes of super 8 footage of me as a toddler
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.480]  Like so it's but it's crazy
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:42.480]  That in 13 years that we've gone from shooting standard definition on mini DV tapes and you still see the tape like
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.640]  Staticky artifacts every every once in a while to now you can shoot
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:53.000]  4k totally 60 frames per second video on your phone with optical image stabilization
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:55.120]  It is absolutely insane
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:59.200]  And let me tell you a funny thing that just like sort of thinking forward
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.720]  So I've been trying to work on a story about augmented reality
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:09.680]  Told in augmented reality and so as part of my current job of you know
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.760]  Kind of also exploring some new video opportunities for the video department here at the journal
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:17.000]  I started talking to a company that shoots
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.640]  basically depth video
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.840]  360 well
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:27.720]  a there's a couple different terms for it, but basically what's called volumetric video, which is like
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:35.080]  an object that's you get the 360 view but it would have depth to it and sort of what the new iPhone camera can do but
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.400]  Only that can only do it. I guess about 180 degrees, but they can do it 360 degrees
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:44.500]  So there's this company in LA that that does this and I almost went to their their
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.080]  Set and everything and did it turns out the file size is just massive and awesome technology
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.720]  that just isn't really ready to to be put into apps right now and
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:00.840]  The woman who was doing the PR said bring your bring your new son with you because this is how
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.240]  they that his generation is gonna have videos and photos and
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:12.580]  And isn't it gonna be amazing that you'd have this now as like sort of you as a place marker in time or a marker in
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.760]  time
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.000]  Which I actually thought was a really good PR pitch
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.200]  But also made me think is is it actually is this how like my kids and your kid now?
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.200]  Like you said he's 13 you say
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.420]  So 13 years from now, is that the type of video and photos that our kids will be taking? Yeah
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.440]  I don't know. It's hard for me to say like
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.500]  Yeah, there's no way to predict. I just thought it was interesting like yeah
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.160]  Is there gonna be are we gonna be 3d objects that sit on tables? I don't know
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.440]  Yeah, it's like I knew that the 3d TV fad from five years ago was
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:53.760]  Nonsense, like I just knew a media is like this is this is not this is not good. This is just a
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.720]  Industries trying to get people to buy TVs that they don't they shouldn't want
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.800]  Like is there something in the future though?
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:05.600]  That will make like truth TD like you know what I mean?
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.600]  Like the the 3d that you could do five years ago is a gimmick and required goggles and stuff
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.600]  But is there something with depth?
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.520]  Sensing that could blow away thinking of photos and videos as it as a flat
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:23.040]  Image, I think that's probably true. You know, I think that will be true and there's gonna be something
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.480]  You know what? I mean? And it's the same way that I the way that I was like, wow, this is great
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:32.120]  I'm gonna get this great digit digital video of my son as a you know as a toddler and
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:35.000]  You know thought this will be great
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.040]  I'll be so happy for the rest of my life that I've got this stuff, you know, and literally ten years later
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.400]  I'm like, this is a joke and I feel like there's gonna be something that's gonna make the video and footage that you're shooting now
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.160]  It look like a joke in ten years
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:53.720]  Yeah, I mean like I think the AR stuff is actually really compelling because when you do look at it or we
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.760]  And one of the tests that I've done where I'm sort of this
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:01.280]  3d object that sits on the table. It does feel so much more lifelike, right?
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.360]  like I do I'm like, oh god, that really is me and you can actually see the proportions of my face and
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.160]  I
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.920]  Don't know. It's just
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.680]  The technology is not there yet, obviously, but I do wonder okay thirteen years from now
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:22.560]  What is what is the way we're we're looking at photos or preserving memories? Yeah, I don't know but it's it's always changing
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560]  There's no doubt about it
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.560]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about this
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.740]  One last piece of follow-up and I think I was with panzerino last week
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:39.280]  but we were talking about the fast charging on phones and I I think it's I think it's a real nickel-and-dime move that that with
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.520]  800 to
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:45.940]  $900 phones and I'm guessing with the thousand dollar plus iPhone 10
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:54.480]  Coming up that Apple still ships the little measly 5 watt charger and they have this new fast charging feature on on the new iPhones
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.320]  Mm-hmm, and I did some timing on it
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.680]  it doesn't it does charge faster than my iPhone 7 but it actually doesn't charge that much faster because I
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:07.040]  Guess there's a certain threshold where they can call it quote fast charging
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:14.200]  But iPhones for years and years now have charged faster if you charge them in a more powerful wall unit
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:14.520]  Yeah
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:20.920]  Specifically for me always just use the iPad one just use the iPad one everywhere and your your phone will charge much faster than it
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:25.360]  Does in the little the little cube, you know, the one that looks like a pair of dice or a die
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.360]  You know from a board game
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:34.480]  But to get the true fast charging you needed apples if you do a stick with Apple stuff you got to buy separately apples
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.160]  29-watt charger. It's the same charger that comes with a MacBook
[01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.160]  you know the MacBook with one port and
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.800]  Apple charges like $300 for this charger
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.560]  It's basically it is it is a very expensive charger
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:56.240]  It does charge faster, but our friends at anchor or anchor if you prefer they have a 30 watt charger
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.600]  That's only 26 bucks. I will put a link to the Amazon thing in here for it
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.240]  Apples 20 area. I actually have a note apples is not $300
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.660]  it's $49, but as far as I can tell the anchor one for $26, which is
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.600]  Not quite right if only they would cut it cut the price by a dollar
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.360]  I could say it's half the price but one dollar away from being half the price of apples and
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.480]  Is every bit is good. Are you talking about the four port one? No, no, no, it's just it's because I have
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:33.160]  It's it's a $26 charger. That is exactly like an Apple charger except black. Yeah, I'll quick send you a link it is
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.300]  Yes, yes and yeah, that's the thing to get the true fast charging you need USB C
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:49.700]  that's the thing I'm talking about if anybody's confused to get the true fast charging and to charge your iPhone the
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:54.440]  Fastest way you possibly can it has to be USB C because USB C has a higher power
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.280]  Capability than us older versions of USB. So it's a brick
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.200]  You put in a wall a little a little tiny thing about the size of an Apple charger
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.340]  You put it in the wall. You connect a USB C to lightning cable to your this is yeah
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.440]  Yeah, now the other thing that Apple the one I have which I think again
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:19.320]  I mean, maybe I should just start a whole new website that's dedicated to about charging because I have so many char
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.680]  I don't need to write this column again, and it's funny anytime. I have a briefing with Apple
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.120]  I always want to talk about why they don't make better chargers
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.360]  And they obviously do not want to talk about that with me ever
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.120]  I
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120]  Have the four port USB
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.560]  regular USB a
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.960]  But we'll charge just as fast as a as a whatever a 29 watt or is it?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.960]  What is the iPad one is a 29 watt?
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.840]  Yes, 29 not. Yeah, not 30
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.700]  Which is you know
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:58.120]  They have four ports and then you can plug in your iPhone and your iPad or your eye like I plug in when I that's the
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.060]  Single charger brick I that I travel with if I don't have my MacBook and I just try you can charge your iPad
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.600]  iPhone and Apple watch in the same thing
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.720]  Here's the other thing that it's really hard to get a
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.880]  USB-c to lightning cable like and I don't think I think yeah, I think I'm right that mono price still doesn't make one
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:29.080]  So you got to buy apples and it's a $25 cable for just a goddamn one meter charging cable
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:35.640]  So even you know the cheapest way you can get fast charging on your iPhone to my knowledge with recommended
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.400]  Certified cables is to get the anchor thing you plug in the wall
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:45.400]  That has a USB-c port on it and then you get apples USB-c to lightning cable, which itself cost 25
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.400]  Yes, but then you can charge your phone faster
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.840]  But I'm doing a story on this I'm making some time
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.520]  Yeah, I I think getting all this crap in and I'm testing it all. Yeah, I've seen this this you the anchor thing
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.280]  I'm gonna buy one of these I'll put this in the show
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:04.520]  I have four of these so it's I have I have I have one of these at my office
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.800]  I have one of these at home and I keep one of these in my bag. It's a 40 watt
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:14.160]  Four-port. Michelle has one of these be wall charger. Now this these are USB a ports though. Yeah, that's the thing
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.680]  Yeah, I don't find that the fast charging I my personal this won't this won't happen with the fast
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.680]  I mean this will charge faster than the dice
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.380]  Right and and I don't charge as fast as what as the USB-c new fast charging spec
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:32.920]  But I don't think the difference between this that USB a charging with it with a with a bigger charger with like a 10 watt
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.960]  Or a greater charger. I don't think the difference is that great to buy it
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:39.500]  I really don't in my testing I it does charge a little faster
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.780]  But not that much faster unless you frequently find yourself in a situation where you've literally got
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:49.360]  Five minutes to get the most charge you possibly can and and a five percent
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.760]  Difference in the battery charge you get in five or ten minutes is actually gonna make a difference
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:59.800]  Which I can't imagine that scenario. It's not worth it. Yeah, this is a great product to keep in a bag for traveling
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.800]  It's it's a
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.880]  Complaints about yeah, the one complaint I have about this is that the cords just get tangled
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:14.900]  Because you but but if you buy the fabric cords from mono price or from anchor you're you're in a better place
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:21.480]  that's another thing about the court yeah, like the the the cords that are made out of like like a
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.380]  A
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:30.680]  Braided fabric, would you call it? It's like yeah, they don't get tangled and they're cheaper than I know I love those. Yeah
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.900]  Anyway, this is good stuff. I love talking about cords
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.840]  Definitely going to my editor right after this and asking to write this cord charging story soon
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.640]  I've been I was like, I think he wanted me to wait for air power. Is that what's called air power?
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:49.680]  that's I
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:56.160]  Know it's not. Yeah air power air power. I keep power. I keep wanting to call it air charge, but it's called air
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.280]  Yeah, I want to call it I power
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.360]  but yeah, I mean, I think that's probably its own piece and
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400]  I'm still so
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.000]  does air power work with the current Apple watch I
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.920]  Believe so, but that may it might only work with the series 3 watch. I'm not sure
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.000]  And that's an interesting question, I don't know
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.880]  I guess I should and does it work with the current air pods?
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.760]  It no, you'll need a new case. Has anyone seen my air pod?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:27.960]  No
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:34.320]  It definitely won't work with the current air pods because it's it goes through the case and that's what they showed on
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.520]  Stages that there's going to be a new case for air pods
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.280]  They're air pods and the air pod case the way you'll know if it's new or old
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.320]  Is that the little light that tells you it?
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:47.280]  You know, is it green or orange to let you know? The charging state is on the outside
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.280]  Not the inside because you'll be able to rest it and Apple's plan is that when these new air pods come out
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.120]  They're going to sell that case separately for people who already own air pods
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.120]  I see probably for some that smart ridiculous amount of money, but
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.560]  You know, it is what it is. I don't know where my air parts are right now. I
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:12.360]  Do know that they went through the wash again last week and they Oh yet again came out perfectly fine
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:15.640]  Just a little bit cleaner now
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.880]  Yeah, let me take one last break I know we're running short on time I want to take one last break and thank our

[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.440]  I'd somehow I knew we were gonna end up on cables and chargers. I think it's important and I think it's me
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.840]  I mean you brought it up this time. I know but I I well, I think it's I love it. I
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.320]  I
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320]  actually so I
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.280]  Think I said this in this interview with the verge
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:37.040]  Is that anchor has become so popular because Apple does such a terrible job of providing solutions for charging its gadgets. Yeah
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:44.200]  Not only because of the price which we all know but they actually solve the problems that Apple doesn't solve with their
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.000]  billions of dollars for R&D and for
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.680]  You know face detection and all these things which is they solve the problem of multiple USB ports
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.320]  better quality product not not a cable that falls apart and
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.320]  I mean and now some of this fast charging stuff
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.600]  Yeah, I just don't get it I don't I don't I
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.920]  Don't know
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.800]  I'm obsessed with I have blown so much money over the years on
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.320]  Portable battery chargers. The basic idea is that for days like when I'm at
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:27.720]  On vacation like at Disney World it just kills your battery just kills it because a I'm on the phone all the time
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.720]  Just waiting in lines for rides or whatever and when you're in a big crowd like that
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.440]  It it's just you know, even if they as they've made service cell service better there
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.280]  It just kills your battery
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.440]  Days, like when we have the events at Apple
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.680]  It's like I'm on the phone
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:49.560]  Doing Twitter during the keynote in a room full of a thousand people who are all doing the same thing
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:53.840]  And yes, the Apple has a really nice Wi-Fi network that's set up for that. It works really well
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:58.000]  But somehow on those days my phone just takes a beating and I don't want it to go dead
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:04.080]  So I love having just a that small. I don't want a big one. I don't want like a giant charger for charging
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:09.080]  Six phones at once or for charging an iPad. I just want a charger
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:14.120]  I can keep in my pocket that I won't even feel like I have something in my pocket and I've gone through so many of
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:18.440]  Things like this and there was like a Mophie one I had for a while that they don't make any more
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:22.840]  It was really small like a credit card size one from Mophie and it fell apart at some point
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.240]  So anyway, the one I love best is this one. I just sent you the link to I'll put it in the show notes
[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:33.880]  It's a $20 one from anchor. It's the only thing I don't like about it. So cute because it's a cylinder it does roll around
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.000]  But I kind of wish it was more like a pencil like where it had like at least one flat
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.360]  Side or something, but it's just like a little cylinder
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:50.400]  And you put it in your pocket and it's like you don't even notice it's there and and then I there's other ones that I've had
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.200]  I have a whole shelf full of these things and I have some that have built-in lightning cables, which is super convenient
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:01.200]  But all I do is I buy like a little the smallest possible lightning cable you can get I think Amazon sells one
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.560]  That's only like three inches long or something or four inches. I don't know
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.680]  The mono price one is six inches long, which is actually longer than you need for this thing
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.780]  But just get like a cheap
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.320]  three inch four inch six inch lightning cable
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.420]  Lightning the USB from Amazon or from both or from mono price or something like that
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:26.500]  You plug it into this thing and it just works and it's and it's super solid
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.620]  It's like the build quality on the anchor stuff is so impressive
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.580]  Compared to other brands in my opinion
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:38.400]  Yeah, yeah, I mean I you know, I still have the smart battery case from Apple for my phone
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:45.140]  So I I don't buy some of these likes more peripheral battery chargers, but these are these are good things
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:52.380]  This one's just adorable. Yeah, it's real and it's just really really good. Really. I don't just really it just feels good
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:55.060]  Whereas a lot of the ones I have from other companies. Yeah, I
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:02.940]  Didn't think about this, but will the 10 so the tennis was to have two hours more battery life. Yeah, supposedly
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.820]  Are they gonna make a battery case for it? Yeah, they gonna make a battery case, right?
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.460]  Maybe I don't need one. I bet that they don't I
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.980]  Bet they don't
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:15.100]  Because it would yeah, I
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:21.220]  Think that there was always that I think Apple was late to dip their toes in that and they you know
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:25.940]  They introduced it like in a weird way like I think it was with the iPhone 6 or 6s
[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.540]  It was definitely somewhere in that area because they didn't it was a success and and they didn't do it at their event
[01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.540]  they just sort of
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:40.700]  They just sort of they actually introduced it via reviews. Yeah, so I had one of the I think they only seeded to like me
[01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:44.940]  And a couple of other people and I had or you probably had it too. I think we actually talked about it
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:51.540]  Yeah, and I mean I have always been a fan of that product. I know a lot of people think it's ugly. I
[01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:54.260]  Love it. Yeah, I like it, too
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:59.240]  I've spent a lot of money on them too, but it doesn't fit my needs because I don't need it
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.880]  90 95 percent of the days of my life and on the days when I do
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.060]  I'd rather still have my phone no case
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.800]  until I need to charge and then just have a thing in my pocket that I can plug it into for a couple of minutes and
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.640]  Get it get a little like top off
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.780]  But I can see I read one and I like I have it on all the well
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:23.360]  Actually, it just broke so I haven't had it on somebody tried to shove their phone in it and it broke the US lightning
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.620]  But see I am like if I'm in meetings all day and I'm on my phone or like I
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:35.240]  I on my commute, which isn't that long. I just I'm on my phone non-stop for 45 minutes with no service
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:41.300]  So it's looking for service and I mean I can get to the office and be it be down to 50% already. Yeah
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:43.860]  Yeah, you need something. Yeah, I
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:47.580]  Love that product. My guess is that the increase I mean they actually I mean
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:53.260]  I think the two hours of battery life that Apple is claiming is two hours of in use battery life and if that's true
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.100]  Yeah, if that's true, I think it's got battery life more
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:02.180]  That's why they never made one for the the plus-size phones the plus-size. They don't need it. So I don't know
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.940]  Yeah, no, and I mean that should get I think that should get me through
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.380]  it should be
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.440]  yeah, it makes sense with the OLED screen and I guess the
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:19.040]  More screen space or the the you know, they have more space in there to pack a little bit of a bigger battery
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:23.580]  How are we doing on time? We got it. We got to wrap up soon, right? We do
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:27.740]  Anything else you wanted to talk about before we we do sign off?
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:36.260]  Tiny MacBook Air cables. Yeah my review of the tiny MacBook Air
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.940]  Did you see the the Google Levi's commuter trucker jacket with Jacquard I
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:49.300]  Think I saw some tweets about it. It's the dumbest looking thing
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:55.060]  I've ever I don't know what I feel like the one problem with Google is that they they don't have any they don't seem to
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:59.980]  Have anything inside the company that stops a dumb idea from coming out
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:07.380]  Like I think it was that I think that it's good for companies to throw out crazy ideas like having a smart jacket
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.180]  But then at a certain point before you actually ship it as a product
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.300]  You've got to say well wait
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.460]  This is you know
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.900]  This needs to be killed because this isn't you know
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:19.220]  Let's go back to the drawing board and come back in another year or two with something better
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.260]  It's just it's not even worth going into but it's just useless
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:31.500]  It's like it's a denim jacket that you put a device in the sleeve and it becomes like a remote control for audio and for
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:38.380]  Talking to Google assistant, but this isn't new is it I mean like that idea has been around for like ski jackets
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.820]  And Apple came out like that Apple came out with one in 2003 for the iPod
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:48.220]  It was like forgetting, you know, and you know, the only advantage over this over that was that
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:54.060]  Back in 2003. You still had to plug your iPod in you know was it wasn't wireless
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:57.780]  It was all cabled to your headphones and this is obviously over Bluetooth
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:01.380]  But I just can't see if you have to have headphones in for any it doesn't have a display
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.220]  So everything you get from it is through headphones
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.940]  Why not just put the smart thing in the headphones and then you don't have to have the jacket on all the time
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.620]  Like it's it in no way is better than let's just say air pods
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:15.060]  for example where
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:20.880]  You don't have to wear the same jacket every day and keep the jacket on and all the time and and then it came out
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:24.300]  That they say you can you can only wash it ten times before it loses
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:31.680]  You can only watch a jacket, I mean I granted I don't know the last time I washed my jean jacket, but I mean
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:36.220]  Well, I actually got II wondered about that because I don't really wash a jacket all that often
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:40.340]  But I don't wear a jean jacket, but I did get email from some people in who live in San Francisco
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:45.220]  and say that they wear a jean jacket often and they do need to wash it all the time because it picks up the
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:49.540]  Many fine aromas of the city of San Francisco very easily
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:57.100]  God, so I my my quip on daring fireball after it was it came out that it can only be washed ten times
[01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:03.540]  Was that it not only figuratively stinks, but will literally stink as well. I was pretty proud of that one
[01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.420]  I
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.420]  I'm proud of you for that is that I'm just looking at this. I don't understand
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.680]  I mean that I've written so much about I mean
[01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:15.780]  So much about this smart dumb tech. Oh
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.220]  Good, there's a guide to how to use your jacket. That's always what I've wanted
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:25.020]  All right, we'll wrap this up. This is gonna brush your side. You gotta brush the side
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.140]  What these are gonna be the best show notes ever?
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.660]  We're gonna I mean the entire thing was show notes
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:38.820]  And it's just all of this show should just be called show notes. It's all just links to noumeno cookies and anchor charging products
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.720]  Basically, what else was on your list here that you are you want?
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:48.460]  Yeah, I think that was about it. That's it's fine. Oh, you have my tweet in here about the face ID on the watch
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.620]  I still think that's a good idea. All right, let's wrap the show with that. What I that raised my
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.420]  I was like, hmm why?
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:02.820]  Mostly I think it's because I've been taking the watch on and off so much. So I'm always typing in the little password
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:06.420]  But also there are so many times
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.420]  Where and this is goes back to the the nose watch
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.260]  Situation where my hands are full
[01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:18.160]  Right walking the dog. I have a bunch of stuff in my hands. I'm going into the door
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.940]  You know my mail, I've got the mail my bag all this stuff
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:25.580]  And I can't I can't touch the watch
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:33.100]  So I guess we would I guess face ID would need to turn into some sort of other sort of gaze control. Yeah, but I
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:36.140]  Could see that I actually know exactly what you're talking about
[01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:43.340]  And and you know as somebody who like my face not able to control the watch as somebody who's a lot of the time
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:48.860]  Still wears a like a analog mechanical watch and and you know, I've got like three or four
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.300]  Which counts as to some degree as a collection?
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:55.980]  When you have a handful of stuff and
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.100]  It seems to me like that's the most likely time when the raise to wake on the watch
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.940]  Doesn't work because you can't move your wrist
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:11.140]  crisply enough because like especially if like what you're carrying on your watch hand is is a beverage and
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:18.660]  And it and I it frustrates me every time I do that where I I'm looking clearly at the watch face and it's just black
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:24.500]  And I know that if I had a different watch on I'd be able to see what time or the date or whatever is
[01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.220]  So I could see that I could see that if if it had like a face ID thing that was always
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:33.180]  Gesture control right a little bit our facial gesture
[01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:35.940]  I mean and look I think that's where I mean
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.940]  There are a lot of I think one of the most exciting things about the ten and I don't want to get into this
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:45.700]  Because I'm sure you've done many podcasts on the ten and and we can do it after the ten comes out
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:53.060]  I do think that Apple is setting up the technology here for some other paradigms to interact with the screen and
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:58.900]  You know as dumb as an emoji might seem to some people there's a lot of interesting technology in there
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.500]  That's allowing you to sort of move your face
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:08.580]  And it's it's I mean how accurate some of that face stuff was that when I saw it in the demo was a little bit scary
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:10.300]  actually
[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:15.540]  Like it picked up me blinking right in my in my animoji poop emoji
[01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:23.780]  demo at the when I recorded it and sent it to myself and it's in my video from the event at the end my eye sort
[01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:25.560]  Of I guess blinked
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.920]  But we cut it on that end. So it looks like my I had like a lazy eye
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.060]  My animoji has like a lazy eye, right?
[01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:39.000]  So they're the same way that you can snap a photo and and have it snap at the wrong
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:41.980]  Just the wrong moment of like mid wink
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.780]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:50.580]  I've noticed I've noticed with the iPhone 8 that I took some photos of my son and I thought like based on the snapshot that
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:55.500]  You get right when you press the shutter that I got him like mid lazy eye and then I look at the photo and it's
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:01.340]  Not and I think that the phone is being smart enough to detect it and say let me take the frame
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:06.620]  From an eighth of a second later, you know what I mean? Especially if it's a live photo. Yep
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:11.600]  It's I I'm convinced that the iPhone is doing that now, you know, which product I want
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:17.780]  So anyway, I want face ID in the MacBook in the MacBook me too. I do I think I think the
[01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:19.940]  totally
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:23.660]  Just I open the clamshell and it doesn't matter if I'm wearing like that
[01:31:23.660 --> 01:31:26.300]  I love the thing where if you have your watch it'll unlock it
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:31.140]  It's one of the main reasons I wear the Apple watch while working but I would it would be so much better
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:37.080]  If it all I do is open the clamshell and it's like oh, it's you here. You are unlocked. No touch ID totally
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.900]  I think it makes way more sense than the touch ID actually in the Mac
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:46.860]  Yeah, because it's it it's in it would happen in a thing that you're doing. Anyway, right? You have to open the clamshell
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:52.980]  Mm-hmm, literally nothing else. There's nothing else you would have to do other than have it trained on your face already. I
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.740]  think it's a no, I mean I
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:03.260]  Don't know. I mean I don't I mean hard to say if Apple wants us to be winking and moving and nodding our heads at technology
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.140]  but
[01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:06.560]  It seems like I'm okay with it
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.220]  It seems like that would be a would be a fine use case in my life
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.980]  Especially when walking the dog to look down at my watch
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:17.800]  I don't know blink or something and it scrolls to my next message or something. Yeah, I don't know
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:22.940]  well, and it's you you you raise a good point about the unlocking because
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:25.500]  the most of the time I
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:31.780]  Don't have to type the number because I'll just put the watch on and then unlock my phone and then there's the thing
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.900]  Once you've unlocked your phone after you've put it on it'll unlock the watch
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.220]  But now that the watch is being billed as a thing that you don't need your phone with
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.820]  Right and it is right that I think it actually I think you're right that that actually does, you know
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:47.620]  I don't again how in the world would they put that you know, if it's such a big ugly notch on the iPhone 10
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:51.700]  We might be five years away from them being able to embed it seamlessly in the watch
[01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:55.700]  But when it happens, well, it'll it'll seem like how did we live without it?
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.500]  Yeah, and we'll see how Apple pay works on the on the 10
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.460]  But you know as they demoed it you look at the phone
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:06.780]  Right, and then you you put it to the receiver or I don't know if it's the other well
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.060]  Well, and the other thing you have to do on the 10 is you have to double click the side button
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:15.380]  It's like once you in it once you get into do. Yeah, there's some kind of like and and
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:17.620]  I'm not quite sure
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:22.140]  I still don't know and I've there was a whole bunch of things that came out yesterday like an Apple white paper and Renee
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.020]  Richie wrote an article
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:29.260]  I'm still not sure what the order is and what exactly you're gonna see on screen because the thing about double-clicking the side button is
[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:36.340]  People aren't gonna guess that so it's got to be something on screen that tells you double click the side button to
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:38.380]  Confirm that you want to do this
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:42.580]  But it the whole reason to do it is that just because you're looking at your phone
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:48.340]  Nobody can come by you with a near-field communicator and authenticate a charge, right?
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:49.660]  It that's how that makes sense
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:53.180]  It makes total sense when you think about it when you think about it of I don't want to get
[01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.380]  Ripped off just because I'm looking at my phone on the subway and some you know
[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:02.220]  Clever scammer walks by with a little near-field thing that confirms the way it is
[01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:06.240]  Now is you just have to authenticate by pressing down on the fingerprint ID
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.820]  Which I guess is the action
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:12.540]  But you do get a chance though to pick like an alternative form of payment
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.780]  Like if you don't want to use your default card, you want to pick a different card?
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:23.260]  So there's something will appear on screen with an interface for letting you pick another card or to cancel if you just say
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.260]  I don't want to I don't want to buy this
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:30.260]  So something well, then maybe it ends up being that actually it's gonna be faster to still pay with your watch
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:32.340]  yeah, I think so, too and
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:37.660]  Again with the white and it's similar to it like with the watch where you put it into that mode by double-clicking the button
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:42.820]  Maybe that's what it is. You'll just it'll be just like the watch to get it into Apple pay mode
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.900]  You just have to start by double-clicking the button. I don't know and by that might be it
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:51.540]  I don't know, but they'll have to somehow train people that that's how you do it, right?
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:56.100]  Yeah, look, I'm just super excited about an emoji. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lie
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:01.180]  I do think I think that part of the reason they made an emoji isn't so much because they think it's gonna be super popular
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:03.800]  Although it might be but it's you know, it's like those Apple watch
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:09.320]  weirdo emojis never really caught on but I do think that one of the reason they spent the time to make it was to
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.360]  Show you just how accurate the face tracking is, you know the fact I know that's what
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:21.320]  Right, right. It's it really does track like your eyes blinking in real time and the facial, you know contortions you make
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.140]  And I think that it's sort of just like a proof of you know, trust us
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:29.480]  We're really we're not just taking a simple picture of your face. We're doing some serious 3d tracking here
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.400]  right
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.700]  Yeah, I mean I was I was most impressed by an emoji really
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.880]  Well, this is one of those things to one of the funny things about being reviewers is that once assuming I don't even know it's
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:48.080]  Like, you know, I wrote the other day that you know, Apple doesn't talk about things in advance even with with you know
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.480]  People like us but assuming that we get review units of the iPhone 10
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.960]  Before they go on sale
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:36:00.240]  It's you'll be one of the few people I can send an an emoji to because I'll know that you're you're you're on
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:06.760]  No, you'll know I'll just be sending an emojis constantly, right? So like what we had the original Apple watch you and I
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.760]  I don't know just seem sending creepy mime hands all the time, right and heartbeats and
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.240]  little scribbles
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.240]  Haven't done it since the first Apple watch
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:26.720]  No, but you and I had like this, you know, 40 40 message iMessage thread. That was nothing but weirdo emojis and heartbeats and
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:35.960]  Scribbles, it'll be like that. It's there. It'll you'll be getting poop emote poop an emoji from me probably within within weeks. I
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.620]  Got to think about how I'm gonna really test an emojis
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:44.520]  It's it seems like a real job that that Apple designed for me
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:49.960]  It does because it's it is it it lends itself to video very well. It does
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:56.960]  Yeah, which they're always like what are you gonna do with this? Anyway?
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:04.020]  Anyway people shall see people can follow you on Twitter at at Joanna Stern
