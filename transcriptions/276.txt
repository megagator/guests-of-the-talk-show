[00:00.000 --> 00:04.240]  we're gonna make people so angry on this episode.
[00:04.240 --> 00:08.100]  Well, just for the record, it is 7.16 a.m.
[00:08.100 --> 00:10.820]  On a holiday week, the kids are still in bed.
[00:10.820 --> 00:14.780]  And I insisted I'd be happy to wake up early
[00:14.780 --> 00:18.540]  because I'm very excited about this episode.
[00:18.540 --> 00:19.860]  Which we've been, it was funny,
[00:19.860 --> 00:21.340]  because we'll get to it later,
[00:21.340 --> 00:24.440]  but I was actually confused when you posted
[00:25.440 --> 00:27.300]  because we'd been talking about it for so long,
[00:27.300 --> 00:28.540]  I thought you'd already written about it.
[00:28.540 --> 00:31.280]  No, we'll have to get to it then.
[00:33.120 --> 00:35.340]  We have some sad news, though, to talk about first.
[00:35.340 --> 00:38.340]  We have two obituaries to touch upon.
[00:41.780 --> 00:43.420]  The one everybody, I'm sure, has heard about
[00:43.420 --> 00:46.260]  is Kobe Bryant, Laker's superstar,
[00:48.260 --> 00:52.300]  which I hate to say, it almost is like underselling
[00:52.300 --> 00:56.460]  what he meant to basketball and the world at large.
[00:56.460 --> 00:59.620]  Died, passed away with his 13-year-old daughter
[00:59.620 --> 01:03.320]  in a helicopter accident Sunday afternoon.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.480]  Just shocking.
[01:05.420 --> 01:09.000]  And Clayton Christensen, we can talk about after Kobe,
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.500]  I guess, lost, he was only 67,
[01:12.860 --> 01:14.700]  which, again, nowhere near as young as Kobe.
[01:14.700 --> 01:17.360]  Of course, he was 41, but still, just 60, you know.
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.760]  That's how you know you're getting old
[01:18.760 --> 01:20.440]  is when you hear somebody die at 67
[01:20.440 --> 01:22.440]  and you think, ah, too young.
[01:22.440 --> 01:23.280]  Yeah.
[01:23.280 --> 01:24.120]  No, I mean, if you.
[01:24.120 --> 01:28.080]  He lost a battle with leukemia this week, too.
[01:28.080 --> 01:30.020]  Yeah, actually, I wrote about them in conjunction
[01:30.020 --> 01:32.600]  because it was interesting because I had planned
[01:32.600 --> 01:35.340]  to sort of write about Christensen.
[01:35.340 --> 01:39.020]  Obviously, it's been a huge impact on Sir Teckery
[01:39.020 --> 01:41.520]  and on me and didn't know him,
[01:43.700 --> 01:48.180]  but still, of anyone that's sort of been impactful
[01:48.180 --> 01:51.580]  on what I write about, he's certainly top of the list
[01:51.580 --> 01:54.360]  and a figure that's sort of widely known
[01:54.360 --> 01:57.120]  and pretty widely revered in Silicon Valley.
[01:57.120 --> 01:59.740]  And what was interesting about it,
[01:59.740 --> 02:02.160]  then sort of the Kobe news happened,
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.120]  and it was the age thing that was so striking to me
[02:06.120 --> 02:10.040]  because a lot of the people that have died,
[02:10.040 --> 02:12.040]  and the older we get, the more the people
[02:12.040 --> 02:14.020]  that we're familiar with die,
[02:14.020 --> 02:15.140]  and it's just kind of like something
[02:15.140 --> 02:16.780]  that you have to deal with,
[02:16.780 --> 02:19.640]  they still always seem someone that I looked up to.
[02:19.640 --> 02:22.300]  And Christian, to your point, is 67,
[02:22.300 --> 02:24.320]  which is unfortunately too young,
[02:24.320 --> 02:27.640]  but is still 28 years older than I am.
[02:27.640 --> 02:30.640]  And it's like, man, that's a shame.
[02:31.860 --> 02:33.840]  I hope I live longer than that,
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.720]  his poor family, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:35.720 --> 02:38.760]  But it's still like, the way they're in your head
[02:38.760 --> 02:40.980]  is someone that you look up to, right?
[02:40.980 --> 02:45.440]  Whereas Kobe, he was the same age as me, right?
[02:45.440 --> 02:47.680]  I mean, he's two years older.
[02:47.680 --> 02:51.500]  And so, yes, you look up to his athletic accomplishments,
[02:51.500 --> 02:55.840]  and obviously Kobe is a very complex character
[02:55.840 --> 02:57.640]  that is never far from mine,
[02:57.640 --> 02:59.320]  I think particularly with people my age
[02:59.320 --> 03:03.720]  because of the allegations against him from Colorado.
[03:03.720 --> 03:06.600]  That's sort of like, when you grew up with him,
[03:06.600 --> 03:07.720]  I remember him in high school.
[03:07.720 --> 03:08.720]  I remember when he came to the NBA.
[03:08.720 --> 03:10.320]  I remember when he won the titles with Shaq.
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.640]  I remember when that trial dominated the news.
[03:14.640 --> 03:17.960]  I remember when he sort of came back to win the title again.
[03:17.960 --> 03:19.760]  And it was much more of a,
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.040]  I'm not saying I'm Kobe's peer,
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.120]  but it's just like, I feel like my relationship with him
[03:24.120 --> 03:26.720]  is so much different than my relationship with Christensen,
[03:26.720 --> 03:28.060]  neither of whom I knew,
[03:28.060 --> 03:30.160]  but just because the age was very different.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.480]  So it was way more jarring for me,
[03:31.480 --> 03:33.320]  like dramatically more jarring.
[03:33.320 --> 03:34.760]  This is like my contemporary.
[03:34.760 --> 03:36.960]  Yeah, I'm a little bit in between.
[03:36.960 --> 03:40.640]  I mean, I'm 46, so Jordan's 10 years older than me,
[03:40.640 --> 03:43.560]  and Kobe was five years younger.
[03:43.560 --> 03:45.280]  So I'm a little closer in age to Kobe,
[03:45.280 --> 03:46.840]  but he always felt, you know.
[03:46.840 --> 03:48.200]  And it is one thing, I know,
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.000]  I don't wanna turn this into a sports episode of the show,
[03:53.300 --> 03:55.760]  but one thing about being a sports fan
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.840]  is you're far more than other forms
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.960]  of knowing famous people, like following politics closely,
[04:03.960 --> 04:08.100]  or like traditional celebrity news,
[04:08.100 --> 04:10.360]  like actors and actresses,
[04:10.360 --> 04:13.900]  is you're acutely aware of their age and your age.
[04:13.900 --> 04:15.280]  You know, like how old is Brad Pitt?
[04:15.280 --> 04:16.400]  I don't know, I have no idea.
[04:16.400 --> 04:17.560]  The guy doesn't seem to age.
[04:17.560 --> 04:19.280]  You know, Tom Cruise, I mean, Jesus Christ,
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.780]  the guy looks exactly the same as he did 25 years ago.
[04:24.560 --> 04:27.780]  You know, and these guys can keep making
[04:27.780 --> 04:29.520]  the same sort of movies they used to make.
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.400]  I mean, Harrison Ford is still making action movies.
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.500]  I mean, he looks his age now,
[04:33.500 --> 04:34.680]  but I mean, they're still gonna make
[04:34.680 --> 04:36.400]  a new Indiana Jones movie, you know what I mean?
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.480]  Like athletes don't get to do their thing
[04:39.480 --> 04:43.800]  when they're honestly pushing 40.
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.600]  It's a wonder that there are quarterbacks in the NFL
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.080]  who are 40, 41, 42 still doing their thing.
[04:52.080 --> 04:54.480]  Basketball doesn't really work that way,
[04:54.480 --> 04:57.200]  although somebody, I just saw somebody in the NBA
[04:57.200 --> 04:59.840]  is 42 and still log in minutes, but.
[04:59.840 --> 05:02.120]  Well, we have Vince Carter, that's a huge exception.
[05:02.120 --> 05:04.320]  And if there's the NBA is in particular,
[05:04.320 --> 05:07.080]  because it's so, I mean, the edges are so small
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.800]  when it comes to sort of athleticism.
[05:08.800 --> 05:10.840]  Like there's guys that are coming in the league now,
[05:10.840 --> 05:13.320]  they're coming in just like, oh, he's 21 years old.
[05:13.320 --> 05:15.920]  That reduces his value as a prospect,
[05:15.920 --> 05:18.720]  because he has, as a parent to a 19-year-old,
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.680]  those two years of potential development
[05:20.680 --> 05:22.600]  make a big difference, but the implication is,
[05:22.600 --> 05:25.160]  to your point, yeah, you're super aware
[05:25.160 --> 05:27.680]  of how old everyone is, because it's a critical part
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.360]  of sort of evaluating their potential,
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.600]  how much they should be paid, et cetera, et cetera.
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.380]  And yeah, there, the prime of your career
[05:37.380 --> 05:41.280]  is like 27 to 29 years old, and yeah.
[05:41.280 --> 05:44.000]  And so the guys that sort of retire,
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.960]  it's like, yeah, they've been on the downswing for a while.
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.120]  You kind of know what's coming,
[05:48.120 --> 05:53.120]  and certainly we went through that with Bryant,
[05:53.820 --> 05:57.600]  and yeah, but it's like, but it makes it
[05:57.600 --> 05:59.860]  almost more tragic in a way, because it's like,
[05:59.860 --> 06:02.660]  all right, now, on one hand, it's like,
[06:02.660 --> 06:05.360]  oh wait, if Kobe Bryant was put on earth to play basketball,
[06:05.360 --> 06:07.280]  he played basketball, played it well,
[06:07.280 --> 06:09.920]  accomplished all he could accomplish, and that was that.
[06:09.920 --> 06:14.480]  On the other hand, he, more than most athletes,
[06:14.480 --> 06:18.480]  really seemed to be leaning into sort of his second act,
[06:18.480 --> 06:19.320]  as it were.
[06:19.320 --> 06:24.320]  And he was so clearly, again, say what you will
[06:26.800 --> 06:28.400]  and what needs to be said about his past,
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.580]  he was so clearly devoted to his family,
[06:30.580 --> 06:33.400]  and the whole reason he had a helicopter
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.520]  was because he wanted to be able
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.720]  to drive his kids to school in the morning
[06:35.720 --> 06:36.620]  and pick them up in the afternoon,
[06:36.620 --> 06:38.960]  and that was the only way that was viable in Los Angeles.
[06:38.960 --> 06:41.800]  And so he's been on thousands of helicopter rides,
[06:41.800 --> 06:46.280]  and it's like, oh man, it's rough.
[06:46.280 --> 06:49.360]  Yeah, I saw it, it's just a heartbreaking clip.
[06:49.360 --> 06:51.140]  I mean, all of it's heartbreaking, it's just tragic,
[06:51.140 --> 06:54.180]  but there was a clip of him on the Jimmy Kimmel show
[06:54.180 --> 06:58.620]  recently, and I guess he has, or had, four daughters.
[07:00.140 --> 07:01.280]  And some. One was just born.
[07:01.280 --> 07:02.720]  Yeah, one was just born in June,
[07:02.720 --> 07:06.200]  but he has one who's older, his second daughter
[07:06.200 --> 07:08.580]  was 13, and she was the one who died with him
[07:08.580 --> 07:11.320]  when the helicopter crashed going to a basketball game.
[07:12.820 --> 07:14.620]  But he was talking to Jimmy Kimmel,
[07:14.620 --> 07:17.020]  and I didn't see the initial context for the interview,
[07:17.020 --> 07:19.360]  but it was basically that people keep coming up to him
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.460]  and saying, hey, you got all these girls,
[07:20.460 --> 07:21.900]  but you gotta keep going, you gotta have a boy,
[07:21.900 --> 07:24.400]  someone to carry on your legacy, have a boy.
[07:24.400 --> 07:25.760]  And he was like, hey, I already got a kid
[07:25.760 --> 07:28.760]  who's gonna carry on my legacy, Gigi, his daughter,
[07:28.760 --> 07:30.920]  and that she's really good at basketball,
[07:32.240 --> 07:33.400]  and that's the one who died with him.
[07:33.400 --> 07:34.960]  And then I was watching, there were some clips
[07:34.960 --> 07:36.680]  on Twitter of her playing, and man,
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.840]  there was a play she made as a 13-year-old,
[07:38.840 --> 07:41.680]  it was like, oh my God, there was this play
[07:41.680 --> 07:43.320]  where she stole the ball like at a press,
[07:43.320 --> 07:46.520]  and then did a spin move between two defenders,
[07:46.520 --> 07:49.220]  and then the nicest little easiest finger roll,
[07:49.220 --> 07:53.440]  and it was like, oh my God, she's got it, she had it.
[07:56.560 --> 07:58.400]  Just, I'm tearing up as I think about it.
[07:58.400 --> 08:01.240]  I mean, I'm a sports fan, certainly not a Lakers fan,
[08:01.240 --> 08:02.920]  but it's like, man, when somebody dies,
[08:02.920 --> 08:04.780]  I mean, you don't have to root for the team
[08:04.780 --> 08:08.080]  to just, your heart just goes out.
[08:08.080 --> 08:09.660]  And you're a bigger basketball fan than me,
[08:09.660 --> 08:12.260]  but man, you just, what Kobe meant
[08:12.260 --> 08:15.440]  to that generation of players, it's just unbelievable.
[08:15.440 --> 08:18.460]  Oh, that's something that's been super striking to me,
[08:18.460 --> 08:20.440]  because for you and I, it was Jordan, right?
[08:20.440 --> 08:22.720]  Like, Jordan was the guy, you know,
[08:22.720 --> 08:24.400]  I mean, just to do a rough analogy,
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.280]  Jordan was like the Clay Christensen for me,
[08:27.280 --> 08:30.040]  like where you look up to him, like you grow up with him,
[08:30.040 --> 08:34.040]  like he came in the league when I was just a kid,
[08:34.040 --> 08:36.700]  and his dominant years in the 90s, I was in high school,
[08:36.700 --> 08:40.400]  and so, you know, he was someone, like he was older,
[08:40.400 --> 08:43.360]  like he was there present my whole life,
[08:43.360 --> 08:45.760]  like even like the Bird and Johnson,
[08:45.760 --> 08:48.600]  you know, Magic Johnson era, like that's probably,
[08:48.600 --> 08:50.400]  what they were for you is what Jordan was for me,
[08:50.400 --> 08:52.600]  because like they were already there when I got there.
[08:52.600 --> 08:53.880]  I mostly remember them as a little kid.
[08:53.880 --> 08:57.000]  I mostly remember their sort of decline,
[08:57.000 --> 08:58.900]  Wes and I remember sort of their prime.
[08:58.900 --> 09:01.760]  Yeah, I was, yeah, the age difference is such
[09:01.760 --> 09:05.280]  that the Bird Magic, Dr. J era was a little bit more,
[09:05.280 --> 09:07.040]  for me, what Jordan was for you,
[09:07.040 --> 09:12.040]  but like Bird and Magic's rookie year was 79 or 80, 80,
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.280]  79 dash 80 maybe, like where the 80, the 1980 finals
[09:17.460 --> 09:20.720]  was the one where Kareem had the killer migraine headache,
[09:20.720 --> 09:24.320]  couldn't play, and Magic, who was the point guard,
[09:24.320 --> 09:26.600]  played center, came into Philly
[09:26.600 --> 09:29.280]  and won a huge game as the center.
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.520]  I mean, it helps when you're 69 that you can just sub in
[09:33.520 --> 09:37.880]  for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the NBA finals as a point guard.
[09:37.880 --> 09:39.200]  We're the greatest players of all time.
[09:39.200 --> 09:41.520]  But still, it just showed that he was there.
[09:41.520 --> 09:43.560]  But 1980, I was only seven years old.
[09:43.560 --> 09:45.340]  I don't frickin' remember, I can't say it.
[09:45.340 --> 09:47.780]  So by the time I really understood basketball,
[09:48.960 --> 09:52.840]  Bird and Magic and Dr. J were already the guys,
[09:52.840 --> 09:53.660]  you know what I mean?
[09:53.660 --> 09:56.900]  They were just there, they were the NBA,
[09:56.900 --> 10:00.760]  and Jordan was the first player at that level,
[10:00.760 --> 10:03.160]  like someone who's in the argument
[10:03.160 --> 10:04.440]  for best player of all time,
[10:04.440 --> 10:06.640]  and who I still would say is the best player,
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.400]  but somebody who was in that argument,
[10:08.400 --> 10:11.000]  who I remember being drafted,
[10:13.200 --> 10:14.960]  I remember Jordan playing college,
[10:14.960 --> 10:18.700]  I remember when Jordan was on the Olympic team
[10:18.700 --> 10:20.240]  with Bobby Knight as the coach,
[10:22.480 --> 10:24.700]  and I remember the one,
[10:24.700 --> 10:26.140]  I mean, again, I wanna talk about Kobe,
[10:26.140 --> 10:28.480]  but I just remember, as a seminal moment,
[10:28.480 --> 10:30.760]  I remember the time, this 86 season,
[10:30.760 --> 10:32.100]  when Jordan had a knee injury
[10:32.100 --> 10:33.600]  and missed a ton of the regular season
[10:33.600 --> 10:35.240]  and played in the playoffs
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.740]  and lit the Celtics up for 64 points in a playoff game,
[10:39.740 --> 10:41.040]  and the Celtics ended up wanting,
[10:41.040 --> 10:43.120]  but Bird said something after the,
[10:43.120 --> 10:46.440]  and Bird was the most competitive, rotten son of a bitch
[10:46.440 --> 10:48.880]  who ever played sports, and he was just like,
[10:48.880 --> 10:50.720]  even though they hadn't finished the series yet,
[10:50.720 --> 10:52.560]  he was like, yeah, he's the best player of all time.
[10:52.560 --> 10:56.200]  Which is not easy for those guys to say.
[10:56.200 --> 10:58.200]  No, not easy for Larry Bird to say.
[10:58.200 --> 10:59.840]  Well, but that's the thing, though,
[10:59.840 --> 11:02.720]  is the way we feel about Jordan and Bird,
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.120]  or you feel about Bird and Magic,
[11:04.120 --> 11:05.800]  that's how all the players today feel about Kobe.
[11:05.800 --> 11:06.640]  Yeah, totally.
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.200]  And so it's like, when you see them so devastated
[11:11.040 --> 11:13.600]  and that all the guys in the NBA looked up to him,
[11:15.640 --> 11:18.280]  and he was like, he's your favorite player's
[11:18.280 --> 11:21.640]  favorite player, basically, is the way to think about it,
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.080]  and you can understand, it was like an age thing.
[11:25.080 --> 11:26.720]  That makes me feel old, right?
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.280]  It makes me feel old to see all these NBA players
[11:29.280 --> 11:30.320]  that I love to watch,
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.320]  but they're all at least 10 years younger than me, right?
[11:33.320 --> 11:36.240]  So of course Kobe's their guy, and it's not Jordan
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.840]  in the ladies for me.
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.120]  I know all of these guys, yeah, exactly what you said.
[11:41.120 --> 11:42.720]  He meant so much to all of these guys,
[11:42.720 --> 11:43.800]  and there's so many of them who say,
[11:43.800 --> 11:45.200]  yeah, that's the guy who I watch,
[11:45.200 --> 11:47.360]  and I was like, yeah, I wanna be in the NBA.
[11:48.320 --> 11:50.000]  But one of the guys who stood out to me,
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.200]  I mean, I have so many comments, so many tearful interviews
[11:54.200 --> 11:57.040]  in the last few days, but Steph Curry was talking about,
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.040]  I saw Steph Curry, and Steph said that the searing memory
[12:03.140 --> 12:05.560]  for him was that game where Kobe scored 80,
[12:05.560 --> 12:08.320]  and he was like, look, I know Wilt Chamberlain scored 100,
[12:08.320 --> 12:09.920]  but I can't relate to that,
[12:09.920 --> 12:12.900]  and that might stand for the ages.
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.400]  But that was like 1961 or something like that.
[12:16.400 --> 12:19.160]  These guys saw Kobe Bryant score 80 points in a game,
[12:19.160 --> 12:20.560]  and that's what Steph was saying.
[12:20.560 --> 12:24.060]  I saw it, and it was like the modern game.
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.160]  And now I'm in the league, and I know what that means.
[12:28.160 --> 12:30.960]  I know how impossible that is to rack up 80 points
[12:30.960 --> 12:34.120]  in a game, and it's just unbelievable.
[12:37.560 --> 12:40.060]  The other thing with him is, I wasn't a Laker fan either.
[12:40.060 --> 12:41.060]  I wasn't a Kobe fan.
[12:43.900 --> 12:46.320]  Particularly the waiters, he's notorious
[12:46.320 --> 12:48.060]  for he's gonna get his shots up.
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.780]  You say it was a modern game.
[12:49.780 --> 12:51.500]  It was a modern game relative to Wilt,
[12:51.500 --> 12:55.080]  but modern to today's more space-oriented,
[12:55.080 --> 13:00.080]  three-point oriented, a bit more different,
[13:00.180 --> 13:01.300]  different for sure.
[13:01.300 --> 13:06.020]  But I think the thing that marks the sort of,
[13:06.020 --> 13:07.300]  there's different levels of greatness.
[13:07.300 --> 13:09.460]  There's greatness purely in a basketball sense.
[13:09.460 --> 13:13.420]  Like Tim Duncan, probably from a pure basketball sense,
[13:13.420 --> 13:17.420]  a better player, more significant than Kobe.
[13:17.420 --> 13:19.220]  But from a cultural sense,
[13:19.220 --> 13:21.580]  from the holistic nature of basketball,
[13:21.580 --> 13:24.660]  where it's not just about what happens on the court,
[13:24.660 --> 13:27.140]  but the impact on those around you,
[13:27.140 --> 13:29.100]  and the entire media landscape,
[13:29.100 --> 13:31.660]  the sort of expansion of the NBA to China
[13:31.660 --> 13:33.260]  is a huge part of this.
[13:34.180 --> 13:36.980]  Kobe was astronomically more important than Tim Duncan.
[13:36.980 --> 13:38.540]  You know, it's kind of like,
[13:38.540 --> 13:40.700]  if you take a feeds and speeds approach to basketball,
[13:40.700 --> 13:43.300]  you know, to tie it into a sort of tech idea,
[13:43.300 --> 13:45.460]  like yeah, Tim Duncan has better feeds and speeds
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.740]  relative to Kobe, like sort of historically speaking.
[13:47.740 --> 13:50.020]  But if you take a holistic view of all,
[13:50.020 --> 13:51.900]  everything that goes into being a basketball player,
[13:51.900 --> 13:54.300]  everything that goes into being significant and meaningful,
[13:54.300 --> 13:57.620]  like Kobe is just so much bigger.
[13:57.620 --> 14:00.380]  And again, I say that as someone that's not a Kobe fan,
[14:00.380 --> 14:05.380]  but it recognizes the fact that the impact is just so huge.
[14:07.500 --> 14:10.580]  If you could go back in time and draft either him
[14:10.580 --> 14:13.700]  or Tim Duncan as the GM of a team,
[14:13.700 --> 14:15.780]  and your goal is to win championships,
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.700]  I would take Tim Duncan in a heartbeat.
[14:18.900 --> 14:21.260]  Although maybe you kind of want to make sure
[14:21.260 --> 14:23.260]  you have a pop there too.
[14:23.260 --> 14:24.100]  Well, it's interesting.
[14:24.100 --> 14:25.900]  If you're a market like San Antonio,
[14:25.900 --> 14:26.740]  you want to take Tim Duncan
[14:26.740 --> 14:28.220]  a million times out of a million.
[14:28.220 --> 14:30.020]  If you're the Lakers, you want to take Kobe.
[14:30.020 --> 14:31.180]  Like you're the Lakers.
[14:31.180 --> 14:34.660]  You're like the Lakers more than any franchise
[14:34.660 --> 14:37.460]  are absolutely about winning.
[14:37.460 --> 14:39.380]  Like they're the winningest franchise in history,
[14:39.380 --> 14:40.740]  but they're also about the show.
[14:40.740 --> 14:42.900]  And like that's what, I mean, I hate to say it.
[14:42.900 --> 14:45.420]  I hate the Lakers, particularly as a Bucks fan,
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.820]  losing, he's talking about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
[14:47.820 --> 14:51.260]  Like he was a Buck and lost into the Lakers
[14:51.260 --> 14:52.620]  because he wanted to go to the big market,
[14:52.620 --> 14:53.460]  the bright lights.
[14:53.460 --> 14:55.740]  And honestly, Milwaukee probably wasn't the greatest place
[14:55.740 --> 14:59.220]  for someone like him at that time in history.
[14:59.220 --> 15:03.580]  But they're probably, along with the Yankees,
[15:03.580 --> 15:05.860]  sort of like, at least in North American sports,
[15:05.860 --> 15:09.420]  the greatest franchise because they do it all.
[15:09.420 --> 15:12.340]  They win and they're like the star.
[15:12.340 --> 15:13.780]  And they're like the top of the town.
[15:13.780 --> 15:14.620]  It's gotta be a show.
[15:14.620 --> 15:16.300]  Exactly, exactly.
[15:16.300 --> 15:17.180]  Yeah, and I was gonna say,
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.340]  if you're running a sneaker company
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.820]  and you want to sign, you know,
[15:20.820 --> 15:24.620]  rookie Tim Duncan or rookie Kobe Bryant to a deal,
[15:24.620 --> 15:25.860]  you want Kobe.
[15:26.820 --> 15:29.020]  I don't even know which sneaker company
[15:29.020 --> 15:29.860]  Tim Duncan was in.
[15:29.860 --> 15:30.820]  No, I don't know either.
[15:30.820 --> 15:31.660]  I really don't.
[15:32.900 --> 15:35.460]  Whereas everybody knows Kobe was with Danky.
[15:35.460 --> 15:37.220]  Everyone in the NBA wears,
[15:37.220 --> 15:38.500]  I'm pretty sure it's the most popular shoe.
[15:38.500 --> 15:40.460]  It's something like 33% or something,
[15:40.460 --> 15:41.660]  wear Kobe's.
[15:41.660 --> 15:43.340]  Which is crazy, right?
[15:43.340 --> 15:44.420]  For a retired player.
[15:47.180 --> 15:48.020]  Just so sad.
[15:48.020 --> 15:49.420]  Really sad.
[15:49.420 --> 15:50.780]  And then Christensen.
[15:50.780 --> 15:51.780]  Clayton Christensen.
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.900]  I don't know what's more likely.
[15:54.900 --> 15:55.940]  I know that people, you know,
[15:55.940 --> 15:57.180]  there's a lot of people listening to the show
[15:57.180 --> 15:58.860]  who don't know sports.
[15:58.860 --> 16:00.740]  Maybe it's possible that there's more people listening
[16:00.740 --> 16:01.940]  who do know Clayton Christensen.
[16:01.940 --> 16:02.980]  Do know Christensen.
[16:02.980 --> 16:05.420]  This is a very unique audience.
[16:05.420 --> 16:08.100]  But he's best known for his,
[16:08.100 --> 16:11.340]  I would say, I mean, for his theory of disruption.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.940]  Which I should let you summarize.
[16:13.940 --> 16:14.780]  Because I know you.
[16:14.780 --> 16:15.620]  Well basically.
[16:18.060 --> 16:20.420]  So the theory in general is that, you know,
[16:20.420 --> 16:24.220]  if the established sort of companies in a market,
[16:24.220 --> 16:26.620]  they succeed by listening to their customers.
[16:26.620 --> 16:29.820]  And at some point though, they sort of like,
[16:29.820 --> 16:32.100]  they deliver a product that is good enough
[16:32.100 --> 16:33.260]  for most customers.
[16:33.260 --> 16:35.220]  And so in the pursuit of growth,
[16:35.220 --> 16:39.140]  they sort of follow and listen to their most valuable
[16:39.140 --> 16:40.620]  customers and most demanding customers
[16:40.620 --> 16:43.380]  and the products they build become more and more powerful,
[16:43.380 --> 16:45.780]  more and more feature filled and more and more expensive.
[16:45.780 --> 16:48.460]  And what happens is a technological change
[16:48.460 --> 16:52.660]  enables some new entrant to sort of serve the same market.
[16:52.660 --> 16:55.740]  But the new entrant like serves people
[16:55.740 --> 16:58.540]  that don't need the big product.
[16:58.540 --> 16:59.700]  That have sort of different needs
[16:59.700 --> 17:01.180]  and they can't afford a big product.
[17:01.180 --> 17:02.020]  And it's worse.
[17:02.020 --> 17:02.860]  It's a worse product.
[17:02.860 --> 17:04.220]  And this worse product comes in
[17:04.220 --> 17:05.940]  and it sort of builds up a base
[17:05.940 --> 17:07.060]  and it starts to improve.
[17:07.060 --> 17:08.180]  And because it's the worst product,
[17:08.180 --> 17:10.020]  it improves much more rapidly
[17:10.020 --> 17:11.500]  than sort of the existing product.
[17:11.500 --> 17:14.740]  And it's lower price because of technology.
[17:14.740 --> 17:18.660]  And it sort of pulls in and starts to capture
[17:18.660 --> 17:20.500]  slowly go up market, pulling in more and more people
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.180]  until the incumbent is left with nothing
[17:22.180 --> 17:23.620]  but the highest end customers
[17:23.620 --> 17:25.820]  and the super complicated, super expensive product.
[17:25.820 --> 17:27.900]  And this low end product sort of takes the entire market
[17:27.900 --> 17:29.180]  from underneath them.
[17:29.180 --> 17:34.180]  And so you can sort of see the allure here to technology
[17:34.660 --> 17:38.980]  because a technical change is critical to disruption.
[17:38.980 --> 17:41.020]  If you're just a cheap product,
[17:41.020 --> 17:42.940]  it's not a disruptive product
[17:42.940 --> 17:45.660]  because by the time you become as full featured
[17:45.660 --> 17:46.620]  as the existing product,
[17:46.620 --> 17:48.020]  you're gonna be the same price, right?
[17:48.020 --> 17:50.940]  If you're, the analogy I think is commonly used
[17:50.940 --> 17:52.700]  is if you're Motel 6,
[17:52.700 --> 17:56.140]  you're not disruptive to sort of the Ritz-Carlton.
[17:56.140 --> 17:58.660]  If you wanted to actually provide the same level of service
[17:58.660 --> 18:00.060]  and product that the Ritz-Carlton did,
[18:00.060 --> 18:02.140]  you have to charge as much as Ritz-Carlton does.
[18:02.140 --> 18:05.100]  You're cheap because you deliver a cheap product.
[18:05.100 --> 18:08.740]  Whereas Airbnb is disruptive to Ritz-Carlton
[18:08.740 --> 18:10.420]  because a technological change,
[18:10.420 --> 18:14.940]  which is sort of a platform that commoditizes trust
[18:14.940 --> 18:16.700]  where you don't need sort of the brand name,
[18:16.700 --> 18:19.660]  you can start delivering on different vectors,
[18:19.660 --> 18:21.180]  having a kitchen, having a yard,
[18:21.180 --> 18:22.660]  having a different location,
[18:22.660 --> 18:23.500]  all these sorts of things
[18:23.500 --> 18:25.820]  that actually make it competitive
[18:25.820 --> 18:27.340]  in a way that's impossible
[18:27.340 --> 18:29.700]  for sort of a Ritz-Carlton to respond
[18:29.700 --> 18:31.300]  in a sort of one-to-one fashion.
[18:31.300 --> 18:35.500]  So to articulate this, this is something,
[18:35.500 --> 18:38.860]  and I certainly feel this too,
[18:38.860 --> 18:40.940]  there's a big aspect of writing
[18:40.940 --> 18:41.940]  about these sorts of things
[18:41.940 --> 18:44.700]  where it's something that people sort of knew
[18:44.700 --> 18:46.900]  and had an intuitive grasp on.
[18:46.900 --> 18:49.260]  And what's powerful is that someone sort of write it down
[18:49.260 --> 18:50.100]  and put it in writing.
[18:50.100 --> 18:52.620]  This is actually, there's a systematic way
[18:52.620 --> 18:54.700]  that this works again and again.
[18:54.700 --> 18:56.860]  And I think that's what Christian did,
[18:56.860 --> 19:00.060]  particularly for the first wave of technology.
[19:00.060 --> 19:02.460]  Like he wrote that in 1997,
[19:02.460 --> 19:05.460]  which is sort of the end of the IT era,
[19:05.460 --> 19:07.380]  the sort of beginning of the internet era.
[19:07.380 --> 19:11.820]  And it was a sort of, I think, catalyzing moment
[19:11.820 --> 19:14.140]  for a lot of executives and venture capitalists
[19:14.140 --> 19:16.260]  that's like, oh, that makes sense.
[19:16.260 --> 19:17.700]  I've seen this before.
[19:17.700 --> 19:18.540]  I'm gonna see this again.
[19:18.540 --> 19:21.020]  This is what keeps happening over and over again.
[19:21.020 --> 19:24.180]  And this is the pattern I should look out for.
[19:24.180 --> 19:25.060]  That's right, that's right.
[19:25.060 --> 19:26.740]  And what's interesting is,
[19:26.740 --> 19:29.460]  Christensen wrote it mostly for sort of existing,
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.620]  he worked at Harvard Business School,
[19:30.620 --> 19:33.140]  so he writes it for existing managers of existing companies.
[19:33.140 --> 19:36.220]  But VCs and tech executives took it
[19:36.220 --> 19:37.860]  as like marching orders, right?
[19:37.860 --> 19:39.420]  Because they didn't want to look
[19:39.420 --> 19:40.740]  at being the incumbent companies.
[19:40.740 --> 19:43.140]  Like, oh, we're trying to build the new entries,
[19:43.140 --> 19:45.060]  the new entrance to these industries,
[19:45.060 --> 19:46.420]  you know, leveraging technology
[19:46.420 --> 19:49.700]  to have a sort of fundamental cost advantage going forward,
[19:49.700 --> 19:52.540]  where we can deliver a crappier product that attracts users,
[19:52.540 --> 19:53.740]  but over time becomes something
[19:53.740 --> 19:56.740]  that's very competitive with them and beats them.
[19:57.740 --> 20:02.180]  Yeah, and I think that he helped systemize
[20:02.180 --> 20:06.660]  in a very cogent way.
[20:06.660 --> 20:09.340]  Like, there's a lot of people in that racket,
[20:09.340 --> 20:11.340]  whatever you would call what he did,
[20:11.340 --> 20:13.580]  whose writing I find impenetrable,
[20:14.740 --> 20:17.380]  whereas I always found the stuff I read of his
[20:18.340 --> 20:20.100]  very cogent, very clear.
[20:20.100 --> 20:23.780]  And I think what he helped systemize was this idea that
[20:26.380 --> 20:28.980]  what heretofore a lot of people had chalked up
[20:28.980 --> 20:32.980]  to a bunch of unrelated flukes, you know?
[20:34.020 --> 20:38.820]  Like, you know, the Japanese import cars
[20:38.820 --> 20:41.780]  coming in and taking over the,
[20:41.780 --> 20:43.300]  maybe not taking over is the wrong word,
[20:43.300 --> 20:46.020]  but certainly completely disrupting
[20:46.020 --> 20:50.060]  the U.S. automobile market, I think is a prime example.
[20:50.060 --> 20:52.020]  I know one of his biggest case studies
[20:52.020 --> 20:54.700]  was like the steel industry and the way that,
[20:55.740 --> 20:56.580]  you know, lower cost.
[20:56.580 --> 21:00.220]  Mini mills, yeah. Yeah, mini mills, you know,
[21:00.220 --> 21:02.660]  took the market out from under U.S. steel.
[21:02.660 --> 21:04.260]  And I think a lot of people looked at all these things
[21:04.260 --> 21:06.500]  as a series of flukes.
[21:06.500 --> 21:09.500]  You know, in the computer industry, you know,
[21:09.500 --> 21:11.900]  mainframes went to microcomputers
[21:11.900 --> 21:14.740]  and microcomputers were like terribly misnamed
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.300]  because they were huge.
[21:16.300 --> 21:18.580]  I know, what's funny is it was a terrible,
[21:18.580 --> 21:21.020]  it was a terrible naming in general
[21:21.020 --> 21:22.980]  because the personal computer was terribly named as well.
[21:22.980 --> 21:23.820]  Yeah, terribly named.
[21:23.820 --> 21:25.340]  The phone's the personal computer, right?
[21:25.340 --> 21:27.580]  If you look back, it's like this desktop
[21:27.580 --> 21:28.540]  big thing on your thing.
[21:28.540 --> 21:29.380]  Oh, it's the personal computer.
[21:29.380 --> 21:30.340]  I think I wrote that at one time
[21:30.340 --> 21:31.180]  and if I didn't, do I?
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.420]  I sure wish I did.
[21:32.420 --> 21:33.260]  I think I did.
[21:33.260 --> 21:34.900]  I think there was a Daring Fireball piece one time
[21:34.900 --> 21:36.740]  where I was like, one of my reviews of the iPhone
[21:36.740 --> 21:37.780]  where I was like, we blew it.
[21:37.780 --> 21:39.940]  We wasted the name personal computer
[21:39.940 --> 21:42.500]  because this is the personal computer.
[21:42.500 --> 21:46.940]  But microcomputers were only micro compared
[21:46.940 --> 21:48.740]  to mainframes, but you know,
[21:48.740 --> 21:51.340]  and again, over and over again, this is a toy,
[21:51.340 --> 21:53.140]  these aren't serious, and then all of a sudden
[21:53.140 --> 21:54.740]  they put the other thing out of business
[21:54.740 --> 21:56.500]  and then the personal computer came in
[21:56.500 --> 21:58.700]  and they were toys and they're not useful
[21:58.700 --> 22:01.740]  for anything real and they're for hobbyists
[22:01.740 --> 22:04.820]  and people with unkempt beards
[22:04.820 --> 22:05.940]  and then next thing you know,
[22:05.940 --> 22:07.780]  nobody knows what a microcomputer is
[22:08.700 --> 22:09.820]  and it happens over and over again
[22:09.820 --> 22:12.460]  and they weren't flukes that this is a pattern.
[22:14.060 --> 22:15.900]  Yep, I think that that's exactly right.
[22:15.900 --> 22:20.520]  I mean, the, it's super interesting
[22:20.520 --> 22:22.980]  because it means a lot to me personally
[22:22.980 --> 22:26.220]  in part because a big, well there's two parts
[22:26.220 --> 22:27.860]  with Christianity, I wrote about this
[22:27.860 --> 22:29.020]  a little bit in Daily Update this week.
[22:29.020 --> 22:31.620]  Like the first one was I went to business school
[22:31.620 --> 22:33.500]  not because I really wanted to go to business school
[22:33.500 --> 22:35.540]  but because I was like an English teacher in Taiwan
[22:35.540 --> 22:37.540]  and it was the shortest, fastest route
[22:37.540 --> 22:38.940]  to legitimacy in the US job market
[22:38.940 --> 22:41.540]  and I'm like, I just wanted to weigh in
[22:41.540 --> 22:43.500]  to sort of US tech companies
[22:43.500 --> 22:45.860]  and I thought, you know, I had been grown up
[22:45.860 --> 22:47.220]  on sort of tech culture online
[22:47.220 --> 22:49.700]  where the NBA is worthless, et cetera, et cetera.
[22:49.700 --> 22:52.380]  So I was very sort of cynical and skeptical going in
[22:52.380 --> 22:54.600]  and one thing was just one,
[22:54.600 --> 22:56.720]  like being exposed to Christians in there,
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.380]  it was like, whoa, this is amazing, right?
[22:58.380 --> 23:02.020]  Like I didn't even realize how influential he was in tech.
[23:02.020 --> 23:04.280]  I hadn't read him until I got to business school.
[23:04.280 --> 23:07.940]  It's like, it was so, to your point, it was so intuitive
[23:07.940 --> 23:12.380]  and what's so fascinating about his insight
[23:12.380 --> 23:16.020]  is so many sort of strategic evaluations
[23:16.020 --> 23:17.100]  and like you look at companies
[23:17.100 --> 23:19.140]  and why they do what they do,
[23:19.140 --> 23:21.020]  distilled to, wow, they're dumb.
[23:21.020 --> 23:23.420]  And it's like, actually, no,
[23:23.420 --> 23:25.180]  these companies are filled with very smart people
[23:25.180 --> 23:28.660]  and what was so interesting about the disruption as a whole
[23:28.660 --> 23:31.420]  and I think is one of my biggest meta takeaways from it
[23:31.420 --> 23:35.120]  is the implication of it is managers can fail
[23:35.120 --> 23:37.740]  by doing exactly what they're supposed to do.
[23:37.740 --> 23:40.860]  Like their mistake, quote unquote,
[23:40.860 --> 23:43.260]  is serving their customers well
[23:43.260 --> 23:47.320]  and it's like, well, that's what's so elegant
[23:47.320 --> 23:48.160]  about the theory.
[23:48.160 --> 23:50.460]  It's not saying that they're doing things wrong,
[23:50.460 --> 23:52.380]  it's that by doing things right,
[23:52.380 --> 23:54.980]  they're putting themselves in an uncompetitive position
[23:54.980 --> 23:57.620]  if some sort of paradigm change comes along.
[23:57.620 --> 23:59.700]  And you see this again and again in technology
[23:59.700 --> 24:01.940]  where the companies are dominant in one area
[24:01.940 --> 24:03.860]  and they're like, why do startups succeed
[24:03.860 --> 24:04.780]  in displacing them?
[24:04.780 --> 24:07.760]  Well, because something fundamental in the core model
[24:07.760 --> 24:10.740]  shifts at the startup by virtue of being a startup
[24:10.740 --> 24:13.000]  can adapt themselves to and take advantage of
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.260]  in a way that an existing company
[24:14.260 --> 24:16.740]  with tons of people and tons of resources can't.
[24:16.740 --> 24:19.820]  And I think almost the meta point
[24:19.820 --> 24:22.100]  where it's like a cultural point
[24:22.100 --> 24:24.420]  and a cost structure point where you get locked
[24:24.420 --> 24:27.140]  into a way of doing business and aren't able to respond,
[24:27.140 --> 24:31.900]  it's what enables startups to succeed against super,
[24:31.900 --> 24:34.140]  like startups don't just beat struggling companies,
[24:34.140 --> 24:35.540]  they beat successful companies.
[24:35.540 --> 24:36.860]  Why does that happen?
[24:36.860 --> 24:38.560]  And so it's like that meta point, I think,
[24:38.560 --> 24:40.340]  is interesting as well.
[24:41.500 --> 24:43.820]  But so that like was, I first wrote about,
[24:43.820 --> 24:45.680]  Christian said in business school,
[24:45.680 --> 24:47.940]  saying why has Apple not been disrupted?
[24:47.940 --> 24:51.940]  And that was trying to sort of like put them together,
[24:51.940 --> 24:55.500]  like the things about disruption and Apple's successes
[24:55.500 --> 24:56.700]  seemed to go counter to that.
[24:56.700 --> 24:57.980]  But by the time I started Chit checkery,
[24:57.980 --> 24:59.420]  which is a couple years later,
[24:59.420 --> 25:00.900]  I actually thought that,
[25:00.900 --> 25:03.100]  because Christian was very critical of the iPhone,
[25:03.100 --> 25:04.260]  iPhone sort of.
[25:04.260 --> 25:05.940]  I was gonna get to this, yeah.
[25:05.940 --> 25:07.580]  It's possibilities, right?
[25:07.580 --> 25:09.100]  Well, he thought Nokia wasn't gonna back
[25:09.100 --> 25:10.820]  because it's the same technology, et cetera, et cetera.
[25:10.820 --> 25:13.220]  And I'm like, no, that's wrong.
[25:13.220 --> 25:16.100]  And actually, I actually wrote an article called
[25:16.100 --> 25:17.740]  Why Clay Christensen is Wrong,
[25:17.740 --> 25:21.220]  which was probably pretty combative in retrospect.
[25:21.220 --> 25:24.860]  But this was me, like a fresh blogger
[25:24.860 --> 25:27.940]  out of business school wanting to make a name for himself.
[25:27.940 --> 25:30.540]  And so I was probably a little more aggressive
[25:30.540 --> 25:32.860]  in my titling then than I would be now.
[25:32.860 --> 25:36.340]  But it was, it's like, I mean,
[25:37.220 --> 25:38.900]  it's like Kobe, you know,
[25:38.900 --> 25:40.140]  Kobe, he wants to play Michael Jordan,
[25:40.140 --> 25:40.980]  he wants to beat him, right?
[25:40.980 --> 25:44.260]  It's like me wanting to take that on
[25:44.260 --> 25:48.260]  was because he was such an intellectual hero for me
[25:48.260 --> 25:49.980]  that like the greatest honor I could do,
[25:49.980 --> 25:51.100]  it was like, I'm gonna take you on.
[25:51.100 --> 25:52.660]  Like, I'm gonna say why this is wrong.
[25:52.660 --> 25:56.420]  And you're probably a bit audacious and brash in retrospect,
[25:56.420 --> 26:01.080]  but it was a testament to how much I looked up to him
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.260]  and his work that I would even think to write a piece
[26:04.260 --> 26:05.100]  called that.
[26:05.100 --> 26:08.980]  Yeah, basically, and I think he came around on this too,
[26:08.980 --> 26:10.900]  and I think in a very interesting way,
[26:10.900 --> 26:15.900]  and it just shows how intellectually, his intellectual
[26:16.740 --> 26:19.260]  approach was the right way, which was that he's,
[26:19.260 --> 26:20.820]  you know, to me, it's a huge thing.
[26:20.820 --> 26:22.140]  Are you willing to admit a mistake?
[26:22.140 --> 26:23.520]  It's one of the biggest things in the world.
[26:23.520 --> 26:25.660]  And to me, it's, I mean, we could do a whole show
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.620]  about how the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket
[26:27.620 --> 26:30.260]  because nobody's willing to reconsider their views
[26:30.260 --> 26:31.100]  on anything.
[26:32.340 --> 26:34.000]  But like I've always said, the only way to be right
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.500]  all the time is to more or less to try to be right
[26:36.500 --> 26:40.540]  all the time, be smart enough to be right most of the time,
[26:40.540 --> 26:42.660]  but be humble enough to recognize when you're wrong
[26:42.660 --> 26:43.620]  and then correct it.
[26:43.620 --> 26:46.220]  And if you can do that, then you can come really close
[26:46.220 --> 26:47.380]  to being right all the time.
[26:47.380 --> 26:50.200]  But you've got to have that, that last part is important
[26:50.200 --> 26:51.780]  because you're going to be wrong sometimes.
[26:51.780 --> 26:53.840]  You know, I am, no doubt about it.
[26:55.060 --> 26:57.860]  But I thought his analysis of the iPhone was interesting,
[26:57.860 --> 27:02.860]  was that, and if, you know, he might've been wrong
[27:04.500 --> 27:08.020]  even if Apple had made the iPod phone that we had,
[27:08.020 --> 27:09.500]  a lot of us had been expecting.
[27:09.500 --> 27:12.900]  But basically he thought, you know, this is expensive,
[27:12.900 --> 27:14.580]  this is coming in at the high end.
[27:14.580 --> 27:16.500]  Yes, it's, you know, just, you know,
[27:16.500 --> 27:19.000]  it's certainly innovative and it's ahead of the pack,
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.460]  but that the pack is going to catch up
[27:20.460 --> 27:23.340]  and then everybody's just going to buy the mass market stuff
[27:23.340 --> 27:26.740]  and more or less that the thing that happened to the Mac
[27:26.740 --> 27:29.740]  with the Windows PCs would happen again.
[27:31.940 --> 27:33.940]  I don't think that's an unfair summary.
[27:33.940 --> 27:36.780]  And I think even he acknowledged later on
[27:36.780 --> 27:41.780]  that his mistake was that the iPhone wasn't disruptive
[27:41.820 --> 27:43.580]  to the cell phone industry.
[27:44.720 --> 27:47.760]  It was disruptive to the PC industry.
[27:47.760 --> 27:51.820]  And there, the iPhone wasn't a heavy handed,
[27:51.820 --> 27:54.500]  expensive, over the top thing.
[27:54.500 --> 27:57.700]  It was pure disruptive theory.
[27:57.700 --> 28:01.000]  It was lower end, it was underpowered, it was smaller.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.280]  It had this tiny little three and a half inch screen.
[28:03.280 --> 28:08.280]  It ran a cut down version of a PC operating system.
[28:08.320 --> 28:11.100]  It only ran one app on, it still only runs one app
[28:11.100 --> 28:16.020]  on screen at a time and totally replaced so many hours
[28:16.020 --> 28:20.620]  of so many people's days that they used to spend on PCs.
[28:20.620 --> 28:24.180]  That's right, it's a perfect example of disruption.
[28:24.180 --> 28:25.980]  That's what's so ironic about it.
[28:25.980 --> 28:29.060]  And you're right, to his credit, he admitted this later,
[28:29.060 --> 28:33.060]  like he was thinking about the iPhone as being a phone,
[28:33.060 --> 28:35.340]  which is understandable because the name is iPhone.
[28:35.340 --> 28:37.540]  And the whole point is that it wasn't a phone.
[28:37.540 --> 28:40.500]  It was a computer that happened to make phone calls.
[28:40.500 --> 28:43.180]  And once you realized it was a computer,
[28:43.180 --> 28:45.860]  it's the epitome of disruption.
[28:45.860 --> 28:47.080]  And again, because the other thing too,
[28:47.080 --> 28:50.380]  is the way people used the iPhone at the beginning
[28:50.380 --> 28:52.060]  was not to replace their computers.
[28:52.060 --> 28:54.300]  It started out by doing other stuff, right?
[28:54.300 --> 28:55.380]  And what's the point?
[28:55.380 --> 28:58.940]  These products start serving needs that are not met
[28:58.940 --> 29:01.740]  by sort of the incumbent and then they add on,
[29:01.740 --> 29:04.020]  they get better, and then they start to take away
[29:04.020 --> 29:04.940]  from the incumbent.
[29:04.940 --> 29:07.740]  And you end up with exactly what disruption theory
[29:07.740 --> 29:10.780]  sort of predicts, where yes, at the very highest end,
[29:10.780 --> 29:11.880]  you still have PCs.
[29:11.880 --> 29:14.100]  There's things you can still only do on a PC.
[29:14.100 --> 29:18.780]  And PCs actually over time have gotten more expensive,
[29:18.780 --> 29:22.620]  particularly because the only ones using them
[29:22.620 --> 29:24.300]  are the most demanding users.
[29:24.300 --> 29:28.100]  And the entire bottom and middle part of the market
[29:28.100 --> 29:31.740]  has just been completely taken over by the phone.
[29:31.740 --> 29:33.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[29:34.060 --> 29:36.780]  Just in terms of mind share,
[29:36.780 --> 29:40.600]  in terms of what device do people upgrade more frequently?
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.780]  I mean, people would just hold onto their PC now
[29:43.780 --> 29:45.220]  until it frickin' breaks.
[29:45.220 --> 29:48.260]  Whereas people, I'm not saying, and famously,
[29:48.260 --> 29:52.260]  I know that year after year, I repeat myself all the time,
[29:52.260 --> 29:54.700]  that normal people don't upgrade their phones every year
[29:54.700 --> 29:55.740]  or even two years.
[29:55.740 --> 29:59.900]  They consider them very expensive purchases.
[29:59.900 --> 30:02.780]  They put them in tank-like cases to protect them
[30:02.780 --> 30:04.700]  because they're so expensive,
[30:04.700 --> 30:07.060]  and they do use them for multiple years.
[30:07.060 --> 30:10.020]  But they look forward to getting a new phone, right?
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.380]  This is a fun thing when you decide,
[30:11.380 --> 30:13.220]  hey, I'm gonna get a new iPhone 11,
[30:13.220 --> 30:17.020]  and wow, look at this, I have this amazing new camera,
[30:17.020 --> 30:18.460]  and I can do all this stuff.
[30:19.460 --> 30:21.540]  The screen's bigger, it's so much brighter,
[30:21.540 --> 30:22.380]  and they're happy.
[30:22.380 --> 30:25.580]  Whereas people look forward to getting a PC
[30:25.580 --> 30:28.380]  the way they look forward to getting a new microwave.
[30:28.380 --> 30:31.180]  It's like, oh, what a pain in the ass,
[30:31.180 --> 30:33.060]  I gotta take this thing out of my cabinet,
[30:33.060 --> 30:35.380]  and I gotta figure out if it's gonna fit,
[30:35.380 --> 30:39.460]  and oh, man, the buttons I don't really like, you know?
[30:39.460 --> 30:42.460]  Got to try out 15 new mouses if you're John Sirkusa.
[30:42.460 --> 30:44.860]  Yeah, exactly, it's just a chore for most people,
[30:44.860 --> 30:46.500]  whereas the phone is something fun.
[30:49.060 --> 30:51.120]  Yeah, anyway, I just thought that was really insightful,
[30:51.120 --> 30:53.600]  that he just totally completely recognized his mistake.
[30:53.600 --> 30:55.140]  And it wasn't to fit it.
[30:55.140 --> 30:57.420]  It wasn't like, oh, now I've figured out a way
[30:57.420 --> 30:59.860]  to make it fit my famous theory.
[30:59.860 --> 31:02.580]  It was that he figured out, you know, he's correct.
[31:02.580 --> 31:04.700]  It totally disrupted the PC, you know?
[31:04.700 --> 31:05.540]  Yep.
[31:05.540 --> 31:07.020]  Which sort of will tie into something
[31:07.020 --> 31:08.580]  we wanna talk about later with the iPad,
[31:08.580 --> 31:12.420]  which also is closely related to the iPhone
[31:12.420 --> 31:16.460]  and definitely disruptive to the PC industry.
[31:17.900 --> 31:18.740]  Or is it?
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.100]  Yeah.
[31:20.100 --> 31:21.500]  Well, anyway, let me take a break here.
[31:21.500 --> 31:23.260]  Next after this.
[31:23.260 --> 31:27.300]  I did thank our first sponsor, our good friends at Linode.
[31:27.300 --> 31:29.260]  I wanna say Linode, because that's what it looks like,
[31:29.260 --> 31:31.700]  but it's Linode because they run Linux.
[31:32.660 --> 31:37.660]  Linode is the, in my opinion, best hosting service
[31:38.160 --> 31:40.120]  for getting your own server online.
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.980]  It is where I host Daring Fireball now.
[31:41.980 --> 31:44.460]  I could not be happier.
[31:44.460 --> 31:45.300]  I love it.
[31:45.300 --> 31:46.340]  It is so fast.
[31:46.340 --> 31:49.460]  Oh, everything is so much faster at Daring Fireball
[31:49.460 --> 31:51.700]  since I've moved a couple months ago.
[31:51.700 --> 31:54.780]  It just makes me smile every day.
[31:55.660 --> 31:57.120]  I still haven't gotten used to how much faster
[31:57.120 --> 31:58.260]  some of the things are.
[31:59.140 --> 32:00.580]  They've got the pricing support and scale
[32:00.580 --> 32:03.220]  you need to take your next project to the next level.
[32:03.220 --> 32:05.220]  They have 11 data centers worldwide,
[32:05.220 --> 32:07.080]  including their newest in Sydney, Australia.
[32:07.080 --> 32:09.540]  They've got one in Mumbai, India now.
[32:09.540 --> 32:11.000]  They've got one in Canada.
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.600]  And sometimes, it's not just about like how close you are
[32:13.600 --> 32:15.420]  for latency and things like that.
[32:15.420 --> 32:16.780]  Sometimes for legal compliance,
[32:16.780 --> 32:19.420]  you need servers in the country where you are.
[32:19.420 --> 32:21.460]  They've got them all over the world now.
[32:21.460 --> 32:23.940]  And they all deliver the performance you expect
[32:23.940 --> 32:27.060]  at the price that you probably don't because it's so low.
[32:27.060 --> 32:29.020]  You can get started today with a $20 credit
[32:29.020 --> 32:30.420]  just for listeners of the show.
[32:30.420 --> 32:32.660]  I'll tell you the code when I'm done talking about them.
[32:32.660 --> 32:35.300]  But you can get $20 credit and you get access
[32:35.300 --> 32:37.340]  to native SSD storage.
[32:37.340 --> 32:38.900]  Everything is SSD.
[32:38.900 --> 32:41.380]  That, to me, is the biggest reason why Daring Fireball
[32:41.380 --> 32:43.740]  runs so much slower than it did before.
[32:43.740 --> 32:45.860]  Just unbelievable how much rebuilding stuff
[32:45.860 --> 32:48.120]  through my CMS is so much faster now.
[32:48.120 --> 32:51.540]  They have a 40 gigabyte gigabit network, industry-leading
[32:51.540 --> 32:54.800]  processors, and their revamped cloud manager,
[32:54.800 --> 32:56.220]  which is built on open source.
[32:56.220 --> 32:57.420]  It is a single-page app.
[32:57.420 --> 33:01.580]  It is terrific at cloud.linode.com.
[33:01.580 --> 33:03.580]  You get root access to your server.
[33:03.580 --> 33:04.820]  You get an API.
[33:04.820 --> 33:06.860]  They have a Python command line interface
[33:06.860 --> 33:09.180]  if you're a developer and you wanna hook up to it.
[33:09.180 --> 33:10.620]  And they have a plan.
[33:10.620 --> 33:13.540]  They call it the nanode plan, nano because it's small.
[33:13.540 --> 33:15.860]  The smallest plan starts as low as five bucks,
[33:15.860 --> 33:18.660]  five bucks a month, but it is a really good plan.
[33:18.660 --> 33:21.700]  It is really good and an awful lot of very serious websites
[33:21.700 --> 33:23.780]  with a lot of traffic could get by just fine with it.
[33:23.780 --> 33:25.500]  And with that $20 discount I told you about,
[33:25.500 --> 33:27.900]  that's like four months free.
[33:27.900 --> 33:31.160]  Actually, no like about it, it is four months free.
[33:31.160 --> 33:32.860]  Really, it's just a great service.
[33:32.860 --> 33:33.700]  Here's the code.
[33:33.700 --> 33:35.880]  Promo code, talk show 2020.
[33:35.880 --> 33:37.500]  Talk show, that's the show.
[33:37.500 --> 33:39.460]  2020, that's the year.
[33:39.460 --> 33:41.420]  Use that when you create a new Linode account.
[33:41.420 --> 33:44.420]  You get $20 credit towards your next project.
[33:44.420 --> 33:46.740]  And one last thing, Linode is hiring
[33:46.740 --> 33:49.460]  if you're a system administrator or any sort of nerd
[33:49.460 --> 33:51.180]  who might wanna work for a company like Linode,
[33:51.180 --> 33:52.320]  which is a great company.
[33:52.320 --> 33:53.940]  They have their headquarters right here in Philadelphia,
[33:53.940 --> 33:56.340]  in fact, but you could probably work anywhere for them.
[33:56.340 --> 33:59.460]  Go to linode.com slash careers to find out more.
[33:59.460 --> 34:02.140]  So go to linode.com slash the talk show.
[34:02.140 --> 34:04.820]  The URL is linode.com slash the talk show,
[34:04.820 --> 34:09.260]  but the promo code to save 20 bucks is talk show 2020.
[34:10.980 --> 34:12.980]  I believe you wanted to say that during a fireball
[34:12.980 --> 34:15.020]  runs faster now, not slower.
[34:15.020 --> 34:15.860]  Oh, is that what I said?
[34:15.860 --> 34:16.700]  Slower, well.
[34:18.140 --> 34:21.540]  I usually, I have to mute, I was gonna jump on and catch you.
[34:21.540 --> 34:22.660]  That'll catch people's ears.
[34:22.660 --> 34:25.420]  No, it runs faster, so much faster, it's ridiculous.
[34:27.860 --> 34:29.900]  All right, what else do we have on the agenda
[34:29.900 --> 34:32.060]  now that we're done with the obituary parts?
[34:34.140 --> 34:35.440]  I just wanted to toss this out there
[34:35.440 --> 34:37.320]  as a little bit of follow-up.
[34:37.320 --> 34:38.500]  Glenn Fleischman and I, I think,
[34:38.500 --> 34:42.160]  talked about the Astros cheating scandal last week.
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.060]  There's a new website I'm gonna put in the show notes,
[34:44.060 --> 34:46.260]  signstealingscandle.com.
[34:46.260 --> 34:48.940]  This guy is an obsessive, he's a Houston Astros fan,
[34:48.940 --> 34:50.700]  and I give him credit.
[34:50.700 --> 34:52.980]  He's an Astros fan, and he is so upset
[34:53.980 --> 34:57.000]  that his beloved team stooped to such a lowly
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.500]  and dastardly level as to set up a cheating scandal.
[35:00.500 --> 35:05.500]  He logged 8,200 pitches from TV telecasts
[35:07.420 --> 35:11.180]  that are available online from the Astros 2017 series
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.220]  and created a website with all sorts of data
[35:14.220 --> 35:17.240]  about which batters were getting these trashcan signals.
[35:20.460 --> 35:22.060]  Something that I think is not clear
[35:22.060 --> 35:24.560]  to maybe non-baseball fans,
[35:24.560 --> 35:26.540]  there was a, it is super interesting,
[35:26.540 --> 35:27.940]  I retweeted this last night,
[35:27.940 --> 35:31.480]  but apparently Randy Johnson was tipping his pitches
[35:31.480 --> 35:33.580]  throughout his career, and he never knew
[35:33.580 --> 35:35.680]  until Eduardo Perez told him
[35:35.680 --> 35:37.780]  at the Addison Hall of Fame induction,
[35:37.780 --> 35:41.380]  and people were like, oh, what a cheater.
[35:41.380 --> 35:43.860]  No, that's not cheating, right?
[35:43.860 --> 35:46.780]  Picking up this, a guy being on second
[35:46.780 --> 35:48.060]  and looking in on the catcher,
[35:48.060 --> 35:50.420]  or a batter observing a pitcher super closely
[35:50.420 --> 35:51.620]  and figuring out what they're pitching,
[35:51.620 --> 35:53.160]  that's smart baseball, right?
[35:54.340 --> 35:56.980]  And the difference with the Astros
[35:56.980 --> 35:59.940]  is using cameras and phones,
[35:59.940 --> 36:03.420]  and the Boston Red Sox previously using Apple Watches,
[36:03.420 --> 36:06.620]  it's using electronic means to do it.
[36:06.620 --> 36:07.460]  That is the problem.
[36:07.460 --> 36:10.900]  So after, specifically after the commissioner of baseball
[36:10.900 --> 36:15.680]  sent a very curt letter to every team in the league,
[36:15.680 --> 36:18.000]  reemphasizing that league policy
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.020]  is that when it comes to signs dealing,
[36:20.020 --> 36:22.600]  electronic devices of any kind
[36:22.600 --> 36:25.380]  are completely verboten, over the line,
[36:26.420 --> 36:30.580]  and they don't get into what you can pick up
[36:30.580 --> 36:32.940]  with your own eyes and maybe hand signals
[36:32.940 --> 36:35.800]  or whatever else you're doing without using electronics.
[36:35.800 --> 36:38.620]  The league just sort of, there's no rules about it,
[36:38.620 --> 36:40.340]  it's just sort of a gray zone.
[36:40.340 --> 36:41.180]  They didn't acknowledge it, but they-
[36:41.180 --> 36:43.820]  Well, it's not a gray zone, it's totally okay.
[36:43.820 --> 36:45.260]  Like the idea of stealing- Well, they don't mention it,
[36:45.260 --> 36:48.980]  but the commissioner doesn't say that it's okay, right?
[36:48.980 --> 36:50.680]  The commissioner doesn't say it's okay
[36:50.680 --> 36:52.140]  to steal signs with your eyes.
[36:52.140 --> 36:53.720]  It's just understood that it is,
[36:53.720 --> 36:57.620]  because how else, what else, you almost couldn't ban it.
[36:57.620 --> 37:01.260]  But they sent a letter, all this stuff happened
[37:01.260 --> 37:03.180]  after the league reemphasized
[37:03.180 --> 37:04.540]  what had already been on the books.
[37:04.540 --> 37:07.900]  But just to make clear that electronics of any kind,
[37:07.900 --> 37:10.620]  wired, wireless, anything that's electronic,
[37:10.620 --> 37:13.940]  and everybody knows what's electronic and what's not,
[37:13.940 --> 37:16.100]  is banned, and so, you know.
[37:18.260 --> 37:19.100]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[37:19.100 --> 37:21.000]  I didn't see that about Randy Johnson.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.300]  Yeah, I'll pass it to you.
[37:22.300 --> 37:25.200]  But yeah, it's actually, it's funny.
[37:25.200 --> 37:26.160]  The reason I found it is
[37:26.160 --> 37:28.900]  because another former major leaguer retweeted it,
[37:28.900 --> 37:30.280]  said, oh, it's totally true.
[37:30.280 --> 37:32.380]  It's one way I could square up against him.
[37:32.380 --> 37:36.060]  And what's amazing is, that's the sort of thing
[37:36.060 --> 37:38.460]  where it's probably fairly widely known.
[37:38.460 --> 37:41.300]  Like, everyone's so helpless against Randy Johnson
[37:41.300 --> 37:43.900]  that any tip you can get is gonna help.
[37:43.900 --> 37:46.180]  And he was still completely dominant,
[37:46.180 --> 37:49.440]  which goes to show what a dominant pitcher he was
[37:49.440 --> 37:50.960]  if he was actually tipping his pitches
[37:50.960 --> 37:53.100]  and was still striking guys out like crazy.
[37:55.060 --> 37:56.440]  Randy, for those of you who don't know,
[37:56.440 --> 37:58.940]  Randy Johnson was six foot 10.
[37:58.940 --> 38:00.620]  He was enormously tall.
[38:00.620 --> 38:02.860]  He would've been tall as a basketball player.
[38:05.340 --> 38:08.740]  And he threw like sidearms, or like a three-quarter arm.
[38:08.740 --> 38:11.340]  And was one of those tall, lanky fellas
[38:11.340 --> 38:14.460]  who you often do see in basketball.
[38:14.460 --> 38:18.140]  There's the famous Leonardo da Vinci picture
[38:18.140 --> 38:23.140]  of the human, typical scale of a human being.
[38:23.660 --> 38:26.980]  And I don't know, I just assume everybody knows this,
[38:26.980 --> 38:28.540]  but it's an interesting fact
[38:28.540 --> 38:31.260]  that most people have an arm span.
[38:31.260 --> 38:33.180]  In other words, you put your arms out side to side
[38:33.180 --> 38:35.700]  from fingertip to fingertip,
[38:35.700 --> 38:39.700]  is usually almost exactly as tall as you are.
[38:39.700 --> 38:42.420]  And Leonardo drew this in a circle.
[38:42.420 --> 38:44.620]  He put a circle around a figure of a man
[38:44.620 --> 38:45.980]  with his arms straight out.
[38:45.980 --> 38:48.380]  But sometimes there's a lot of basketball players
[38:48.380 --> 38:52.440]  who have an arm span that's even longer than they are tall,
[38:52.440 --> 38:53.900]  even though they are tall.
[38:53.900 --> 38:56.220]  And it's a tremendous advantage in basketball
[38:56.220 --> 38:58.440]  to have a very long arm span.
[38:58.440 --> 38:59.980]  Randy Johnson was one of those types.
[38:59.980 --> 39:03.140]  So in addition to being six foot 10, which is really tall,
[39:03.140 --> 39:04.620]  and therefore makes the ball come out
[39:04.620 --> 39:06.340]  at an angle you're not used to,
[39:06.340 --> 39:09.000]  and the fact that he threw sidearm, which is weird,
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.020]  and made the ball seem like it was coming out
[39:11.020 --> 39:12.460]  of the side of the mound,
[39:12.460 --> 39:16.420]  his arms were so long that it would take a long stride
[39:16.420 --> 39:17.940]  towards the plate that it was almost like,
[39:17.940 --> 39:20.040]  he threw harder than most pitchers,
[39:20.040 --> 39:22.020]  but because he was so long and his arms were so long,
[39:22.020 --> 39:26.060]  it was like he got to start four feet closer to you.
[39:26.060 --> 39:28.380]  And it was coming in from the side, if you're a left-handed
[39:28.380 --> 39:29.660]  pitcher in particular, it's like coming
[39:29.660 --> 39:30.700]  from behind your head.
[39:30.700 --> 39:32.780]  You've probably seen it,
[39:32.780 --> 39:35.580]  because it was back in the era before interleague play.
[39:35.580 --> 39:37.580]  So National League players didn't really get
[39:37.580 --> 39:38.860]  to see American League players much,
[39:38.860 --> 39:40.940]  and Randy Johnson was an American League pitcher.
[39:40.940 --> 39:44.520]  But John Kruk, Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman
[39:44.520 --> 39:45.660]  in the All-Star game,
[39:47.020 --> 39:48.740]  against, do you ever see that at bat?
[39:48.740 --> 39:49.900]  Yep, yeah, absolutely.
[39:49.900 --> 39:50.740]  Just, just.
[39:52.300 --> 39:53.940]  He's like, he's like, nope.
[39:53.940 --> 39:58.260]  In the All-Star game, and he just was like, nope.
[39:58.260 --> 39:59.840]  I'll have to put a clip of it in the show notes,
[39:59.840 --> 40:02.700]  because it really shows you how crazy scary
[40:02.700 --> 40:03.760]  he was as a pitcher.
[40:04.780 --> 40:06.500]  No, you just think about it, you're in there,
[40:06.500 --> 40:09.020]  it's already sort of terrifying that these guys coming in,
[40:09.020 --> 40:10.060]  you know, 100 miles per hour,
[40:10.060 --> 40:11.720]  because he would throw 100,
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.260]  and it's literally coming from behind your head,
[40:15.260 --> 40:16.620]  like cutting across you.
[40:19.980 --> 40:22.940]  John Kruk looked like if I was up there batting
[40:22.940 --> 40:24.500]  against any major league pitcher,
[40:24.500 --> 40:27.480]  I would just be terrified, leaning back,
[40:27.480 --> 40:30.860]  diving backwards out of the box.
[40:34.580 --> 40:36.580]  Anyway, I gotta put a link into the show notes
[40:36.580 --> 40:39.860]  about this website where this guy obsessively documented
[40:39.860 --> 40:43.080]  8,200 pitches over the season.
[40:43.080 --> 40:45.320]  I just, I'm always fascinated by anybody
[40:45.320 --> 40:48.220]  who's obsessive about anything but this in particular.
[40:48.220 --> 40:53.220]  And again, extra points for him being an Astros fan.
[40:53.900 --> 40:55.700]  What else did I wanna talk about on follow-up?
[40:55.700 --> 40:57.140]  I guess I don't have a lot more to say.
[40:57.140 --> 40:59.980]  Glenn and I last week really went deep
[40:59.980 --> 41:04.140]  on the whole iPhone iCloud encryption thing.
[41:04.140 --> 41:06.900]  So I don't have a lot to follow up on that.
[41:06.900 --> 41:08.420]  I guess the one point I wanna make,
[41:08.420 --> 41:12.120]  and I sorta kinda need to write about it just to clarify,
[41:12.120 --> 41:17.120]  is, and I think that this is a little bit Apple's fault too,
[41:18.340 --> 41:21.220]  is tossing around the word encryption
[41:21.220 --> 41:22.760]  and what's encrypted and what's not.
[41:22.760 --> 41:27.220]  Because it's, at this point, it isn't useful
[41:27.220 --> 41:28.860]  to clarifying what the point is
[41:28.860 --> 41:31.680]  of this whole thing with iCloud.
[41:31.680 --> 41:35.760]  Because everything is encrypted in transit.
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.300]  Everything you do with iCloud from whatever your device is,
[41:39.300 --> 41:42.200]  whether it's an iPhone, iPad, Mac,
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.700]  in between your device and the iCloud servers
[41:45.700 --> 41:50.340]  that Apple runs, on the network, everything is encrypted.
[41:50.340 --> 41:51.240]  Everything you do.
[41:54.500 --> 41:58.260]  On disk, on the iCloud servers,
[41:58.260 --> 42:00.980]  everything is encrypted in some way,
[42:00.980 --> 42:03.200]  except for email, and email's an exception
[42:03.200 --> 42:05.420]  because that's just the way IMAP email works.
[42:05.420 --> 42:08.340]  And I had a link to a Jeff Duncan article
[42:08.340 --> 42:11.580]  from years ago explaining why, and it's complicated,
[42:11.580 --> 42:14.020]  but it more or less, long story short,
[42:14.020 --> 42:18.540]  is because email was invented in the prehistoric days
[42:18.540 --> 42:20.100]  of the internet when everything was,
[42:20.100 --> 42:22.980]  nothing was encrypted and everything was stored
[42:22.980 --> 42:24.980]  plain text files on disk.
[42:24.980 --> 42:29.460]  And email's like the one aspect of that prehistoric internet
[42:29.460 --> 42:32.260]  that's still with us and will probably always be with us,
[42:32.260 --> 42:33.620]  and it's just the nature of it,
[42:33.620 --> 42:36.300]  that that's how email works, it can't be encrypted.
[42:36.300 --> 42:39.540]  So if you ever, if you are gonna commit crimes,
[42:39.540 --> 42:40.380]  don't coordinate.
[42:40.380 --> 42:41.220]  Don't email about them.
[42:41.220 --> 42:42.860]  Don't email about them.
[42:42.860 --> 42:44.140]  Because even if you do the thing,
[42:44.140 --> 42:45.820]  and I don't wanna go on a side note about it,
[42:45.820 --> 42:47.860]  you, and I don't wanna get emails,
[42:47.860 --> 42:50.200]  people telling me about like PGP,
[42:50.200 --> 42:52.600]  where what you can do is email someone
[42:52.600 --> 42:55.440]  where the text of the email is encrypted.
[42:56.980 --> 42:59.980]  Because even then, even if you use something like PGP
[42:59.980 --> 43:02.300]  to encrypt the text of your email,
[43:02.300 --> 43:04.300]  the headers, the header files of the email
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.300]  can't be encrypted, there's no way to encrypt
[43:06.300 --> 43:08.740]  the whole thing, and so like, okay,
[43:08.740 --> 43:10.980]  the contents of an email can be encrypted,
[43:10.980 --> 43:12.260]  but it's a huge pain in the ass.
[43:12.260 --> 43:13.580]  Almost nobody does it.
[43:14.720 --> 43:16.700]  Email isn't really meant to be used that way.
[43:16.700 --> 43:20.340]  And anybody who subpoenas your email or has access to it
[43:20.340 --> 43:21.460]  can see all the headers anyway,
[43:21.460 --> 43:24.060]  and they can see that you were emailing Les Parnas
[43:24.060 --> 43:26.940]  or whoever it was you were emailing.
[43:26.940 --> 43:29.180]  So don't use email for crime.
[43:31.380 --> 43:32.740]  Or anything you don't really,
[43:32.740 --> 43:35.020]  anything you really feel like needs to be secret.
[43:35.020 --> 43:38.060]  But anyway, the point I wanna make is Apple encrypts,
[43:38.060 --> 43:40.380]  so email aside, for good reason,
[43:40.380 --> 43:42.820]  everything that Apple stores on disk in iCloud
[43:42.820 --> 43:45.220]  is quote-unquote encrypted.
[43:45.220 --> 43:49.340]  The issue is not what's encrypted and what's not.
[43:49.340 --> 43:52.560]  The issue is who can decrypt what's there.
[43:53.460 --> 43:54.980]  And there's two types.
[43:54.980 --> 43:57.460]  There's the types of stuff that they store
[43:57.460 --> 44:00.520]  that only you, the user, can decrypt
[44:00.520 --> 44:05.520]  using your device keys and your personal password.
[44:07.140 --> 44:09.860]  And then there's the stuff that both you can decrypt,
[44:09.860 --> 44:14.180]  of course, and the stuff that Apple has its own key for
[44:14.180 --> 44:16.540]  and can decrypt.
[44:16.540 --> 44:20.300]  And iCloud backups are in that latter category
[44:20.300 --> 44:22.840]  where Apple has a key to them.
[44:22.840 --> 44:27.840]  And the good part of it is if you are more likely,
[44:28.060 --> 44:29.260]  probably if you listen to the show,
[44:29.260 --> 44:32.560]  probably not you, but someone you know
[44:32.560 --> 44:34.980]  forgets their iCloud password
[44:34.980 --> 44:38.260]  and they leave their iPhone in a cab
[44:38.260 --> 44:40.620]  or it gets run over by a car or something
[44:40.620 --> 44:42.420]  and gets destroyed.
[44:42.420 --> 44:44.500]  Now their iPhone is destroyed
[44:44.500 --> 44:46.220]  and they go to buy a new iPhone
[44:46.220 --> 44:49.260]  and the only backup they have is their iCloud backup
[44:49.260 --> 44:51.660]  and they don't know their iCloud password.
[44:54.240 --> 44:55.080]  What happens?
[44:55.080 --> 44:56.900]  Well, you can go to the Apple store,
[44:56.900 --> 44:58.660]  and I actually don't know exactly what,
[44:58.660 --> 44:59.780]  a couple people ask me,
[44:59.780 --> 45:02.460]  what do they do to confirm that you're you?
[45:02.460 --> 45:07.060]  So that Joe Random thief can't go into an Apple store
[45:07.060 --> 45:08.980]  and say, hey, I'm John Gruber,
[45:08.980 --> 45:12.060]  I need to get my iCloud backup.
[45:12.060 --> 45:13.820]  I don't know what they do.
[45:13.820 --> 45:15.700]  I guess they, hopefully they ask for ID
[45:15.700 --> 45:17.780]  and I'm actually not sure.
[45:17.780 --> 45:19.940]  I wish I did know exactly what they did to verify it.
[45:19.940 --> 45:23.540]  But anyway, you can, if you somehow convince them
[45:23.540 --> 45:24.900]  you are who you are,
[45:24.900 --> 45:27.580]  they can decrypt your iCloud backup
[45:27.580 --> 45:29.180]  and then restore it to a new iPhone
[45:29.180 --> 45:31.500]  and you don't lose anything.
[45:31.500 --> 45:35.420]  The downside of that is that law enforcement
[45:35.420 --> 45:37.260]  around the world can issue a subpoena.
[45:38.500 --> 45:41.220]  Well, I say downside, downside from a privacy perspective,
[45:41.220 --> 45:42.940]  upside in some way,
[45:42.940 --> 45:45.660]  which is why it's a debate for solving crimes.
[45:45.660 --> 45:47.420]  If you actually are a criminal,
[45:47.420 --> 45:48.500]  they can subpoena Apple
[45:48.500 --> 45:51.020]  and Apple can provide them with the contents
[45:51.020 --> 45:55.020]  of your decrypted iCloud backup.
[45:55.020 --> 45:57.020]  So that's the whole issue, who can decrypt it?
[45:57.020 --> 45:59.540]  Just you or you and Apple.
[46:00.860 --> 46:01.700]  Yeah, that's right.
[46:01.700 --> 46:04.140]  And a few, I think that that's a,
[46:04.140 --> 46:06.780]  that was a good articulation of the issue.
[46:06.780 --> 46:08.620]  And I'm glad you pointed out at the end,
[46:08.620 --> 46:13.620]  like there are, like there is good news
[46:14.220 --> 46:15.860]  that Apple can do that, right?
[46:15.860 --> 46:17.140]  And like, and there's,
[46:18.540 --> 46:21.300]  this is something I thought a lot in the context of Facebook
[46:21.300 --> 46:23.780]  and Facebook's talking about encrypting like messenger
[46:23.780 --> 46:27.580]  and by default and stuff like that.
[46:27.580 --> 46:29.340]  And there's a,
[46:31.700 --> 46:33.140]  there's questions about like
[46:33.140 --> 46:35.180]  child sexual abuse material online.
[46:35.180 --> 46:38.140]  And one thing that comes up is that there's way more
[46:38.140 --> 46:40.660]  instance of it in messenger than there is in WhatsApp.
[46:40.660 --> 46:44.180]  And the question is, is that because people are more evil
[46:44.180 --> 46:45.860]  and nefarious on messenger than they are WhatsApp
[46:45.860 --> 46:47.980]  or is it because WhatsApp is already end-end encrypted,
[46:47.980 --> 46:49.140]  which means no one actually knows
[46:49.140 --> 46:52.100]  what's going through WhatsApp, whereas messenger is not.
[46:52.100 --> 46:55.700]  And again, like to your point,
[46:55.700 --> 46:59.260]  I think particularly in our corner of the internet
[46:59.260 --> 47:01.340]  where more people know who Clay Christensen is
[47:01.340 --> 47:04.940]  than who Kobe Bryant is, there's a tendency to,
[47:04.940 --> 47:07.260]  I think, over index on one side as opposed to the other
[47:07.260 --> 47:09.940]  and say that, oh, obviously it should be this way.
[47:09.940 --> 47:12.020]  Like there's real questions here.
[47:12.020 --> 47:15.580]  And again, that doesn't mean your position is wrong,
[47:15.580 --> 47:18.780]  but I think those of us that,
[47:18.780 --> 47:21.060]  I would say I'm a little more towards the middle,
[47:21.060 --> 47:22.820]  but I absolutely believe in strong encryption.
[47:22.820 --> 47:25.020]  I believe there should be no back doors, et cetera, et cetera.
[47:25.020 --> 47:29.420]  I think by at least acknowledging and appreciating
[47:29.420 --> 47:31.580]  those that come at it from a different perspective,
[47:31.580 --> 47:33.940]  you can make a stronger argument for that position.
[47:33.940 --> 47:36.300]  And so I think that that's an important thing to call out.
[47:36.300 --> 47:39.980]  Yeah, you have to acknowledge, anybody who's a good actor
[47:39.980 --> 47:44.500]  and both is being honest and is knowledgeable
[47:44.500 --> 47:48.700]  about the entire situation has to acknowledge,
[47:48.700 --> 47:51.500]  either way, no matter whether you're on the side of,
[47:51.500 --> 47:54.500]  we really, Apple should maintain these keys
[47:54.500 --> 47:56.700]  and provide them to law enforcement
[47:56.700 --> 47:59.020]  when subpoenaed for good reason,
[47:59.020 --> 48:00.340]  or if you're on the side that Apple
[48:00.340 --> 48:03.700]  should switch iCloud backups to be truly end-to-end
[48:03.700 --> 48:07.540]  encrypted where only the user has the key to do it,
[48:07.540 --> 48:09.500]  you have to at least acknowledge either way
[48:09.500 --> 48:11.420]  that there are significant trade-offs.
[48:11.420 --> 48:14.900]  You have to, if you don't, you're either being dishonest
[48:14.900 --> 48:17.220]  or you're ignorant.
[48:17.220 --> 48:18.860]  Right, and you're not gonna win the argument, right?
[48:18.860 --> 48:21.620]  I actually think the most compelling argument,
[48:21.620 --> 48:25.300]  and I made this a few years ago with the San Bernardino
[48:25.300 --> 48:29.460]  case for winning this argument with the US government,
[48:29.460 --> 48:33.900]  is the US government itself has an interest
[48:33.900 --> 48:37.180]  in encryption being strong and easy to use
[48:37.180 --> 48:38.780]  for normal people because the US government
[48:38.780 --> 48:41.460]  has more secrets and more value than anyone.
[48:41.460 --> 48:44.260]  If you think about it from an industrial perspective,
[48:44.260 --> 48:47.980]  like the most valuable IP in the strongest military
[48:47.980 --> 48:49.460]  in the world is the United States.
[48:49.460 --> 48:52.820]  It follows that the United States has more of an interest
[48:52.820 --> 48:56.020]  in strong encryption than basically anyone else
[48:56.020 --> 49:00.820]  and because keys do get out, keys escape.
[49:00.820 --> 49:03.780]  There's evidence of this again and again and again.
[49:03.780 --> 49:07.780]  A backdoor is available to both the good guys
[49:07.780 --> 49:09.220]  and the bad guys and is usually found
[49:09.220 --> 49:10.500]  by the bad guys first.
[49:10.500 --> 49:14.540]  And so there's a very utilitarian argument
[49:14.540 --> 49:16.380]  to be made in favor of encryption
[49:16.380 --> 49:21.380]  that's not just a privacy good, government bad approach
[49:21.940 --> 49:25.580]  and I think actually would get the industry further
[49:25.580 --> 49:28.060]  as far as, politically speaking,
[49:28.060 --> 49:32.780]  then a pure privacy principle based approach
[49:34.980 --> 49:37.900]  from a winning hearts and minds perspective.
[49:37.900 --> 49:41.460]  I don't think Glenn and I made this super clear.
[49:41.460 --> 49:43.260]  The other thing I think is worth making super clear
[49:43.260 --> 49:45.980]  is from an Apple perspective, two other things.
[49:45.980 --> 49:49.780]  iMessage in particular and then your keychain.
[49:49.780 --> 49:52.060]  And the keychain, your keychain,
[49:52.060 --> 49:54.220]  if you use the iCloud keychain syncing,
[49:54.220 --> 49:59.060]  syncs completely outside of the iCloud backup system
[49:59.060 --> 50:04.060]  and is done in a way where only your keys can decrypt it
[50:05.300 --> 50:06.740]  and Apple doesn't have it.
[50:06.740 --> 50:11.180]  So if the FBI went to Apple and had a subpoena
[50:11.180 --> 50:13.380]  for everything they have about you,
[50:13.380 --> 50:16.500]  one thing they wouldn't get is your keychain.
[50:16.500 --> 50:17.620]  They would not get all,
[50:17.620 --> 50:19.780]  they wouldn't get any of your keychain.
[50:19.780 --> 50:22.220]  iMessage is in a weird nether zone
[50:22.220 --> 50:25.020]  where iMessage, from the get-go,
[50:25.020 --> 50:29.460]  it is, it was, and I heard this way back when it was new,
[50:29.460 --> 50:31.940]  like when Jobs announced it famously
[50:31.940 --> 50:34.100]  and said, we're gonna, no, and I guess it was FaceTime,
[50:34.100 --> 50:36.220]  he said he was gonna open source, not iMessage.
[50:36.220 --> 50:38.620]  But within like a year or two
[50:38.620 --> 50:40.220]  of when iMessage was introduced,
[50:40.220 --> 50:42.340]  I was talking to someone at Apple who said,
[50:44.340 --> 50:45.980]  they had a very simple idea.
[50:45.980 --> 50:49.300]  It would be like SMS, except,
[50:49.300 --> 50:50.860]  some kind of cross between SMS
[50:50.860 --> 50:54.220]  and then like AOL Instant Messenger, remember that?
[50:54.220 --> 50:55.060]  I do.
[50:55.060 --> 50:56.940]  And Apple had an AIM client.
[50:56.940 --> 51:01.180]  They had iChat, which then supported other protocols
[51:01.180 --> 51:02.500]  other than AIM too.
[51:02.500 --> 51:06.900]  It would be a replacement for SMS and instant messaging,
[51:06.900 --> 51:11.620]  and it would use your phone number
[51:11.620 --> 51:15.100]  and your Apple ID, and or, I guess I should say,
[51:15.100 --> 51:18.980]  your Apple ID as a unique identifier for you.
[51:18.980 --> 51:21.180]  The fact that it uses your phone number
[51:21.180 --> 51:23.700]  would allow it to seamlessly replace SMS
[51:23.700 --> 51:25.780]  for iPhone-to-iPhone communication,
[51:25.780 --> 51:27.460]  because it would default,
[51:27.460 --> 51:31.060]  whereas if you and I had been SMSing together
[51:31.060 --> 51:32.860]  from your iPhone to my iPhone,
[51:32.860 --> 51:35.340]  and then we upgraded to the version of iOS
[51:35.340 --> 51:37.220]  that first had iMessage,
[51:37.220 --> 51:40.420]  our communication would just go right to iMessage,
[51:40.420 --> 51:42.100]  and we'd get blue bubbles instead of green ones,
[51:42.100 --> 51:43.420]  and we'd continue without knowing
[51:43.420 --> 51:46.300]  other than the fact that our bubble color had changed.
[51:46.300 --> 51:47.940]  But we would no longer be limited
[51:47.940 --> 51:49.700]  by the technical limits of SMS
[51:49.700 --> 51:52.220]  and perhaps the cost limits,
[51:52.220 --> 51:55.340]  because back then, which sounds ridiculous,
[51:55.340 --> 51:57.980]  some people were still paying like 10 cents in SMS,
[51:57.980 --> 52:02.620]  or had like a 500 SMS a month limit or something like that.
[52:02.620 --> 52:04.460]  And then the other thing in the...
[52:04.460 --> 52:06.460]  Well, just the other...
[52:06.460 --> 52:07.300]  Oh, sorry, go ahead.
[52:07.300 --> 52:09.260]  The one other thing in that initial brief
[52:09.260 --> 52:12.540]  on what should it be was it should be encrypted
[52:12.540 --> 52:16.660]  in such a way that Apple cannot ever see the contents
[52:16.660 --> 52:19.020]  of anybody's iMessages, and then it was like,
[52:19.020 --> 52:21.020]  here, that's what they told the engineering team.
[52:21.020 --> 52:22.260]  They said, here, go build it.
[52:22.260 --> 52:24.340]  But right from the get-go,
[52:24.340 --> 52:26.540]  when it was just an idea on a whiteboard,
[52:26.540 --> 52:29.820]  one of the things right up there with let's replace SMS
[52:29.820 --> 52:32.300]  for iPhone-to-iPhone communication was,
[52:32.300 --> 52:34.460]  let's design this in such a way
[52:34.460 --> 52:37.820]  that we cannot technically ever see the contents
[52:37.820 --> 52:38.940]  of anybody's iMessage.
[52:41.380 --> 52:44.340]  And I think the follow-up to your point, though,
[52:44.340 --> 52:48.660]  if you, and now they did iMessage in the cloud
[52:48.660 --> 52:50.380]  and all that sort of thing or whatever,
[52:50.380 --> 52:53.180]  it would still maintain that approach
[52:53.180 --> 52:55.300]  where it's fully encrypted.
[52:55.300 --> 52:58.900]  But if you have iCloud backups turned on...
[52:58.900 --> 53:01.900]  Right, this is the problem.
[53:01.900 --> 53:03.060]  You can access the backups.
[53:03.060 --> 53:07.260]  Right, iCloud in the cloud is every bit as secure,
[53:07.260 --> 53:08.700]  or iMessage in the cloud.
[53:08.700 --> 53:12.140]  iMessage in the cloud, it remains only decryptable
[53:12.140 --> 53:14.940]  using your device keys.
[53:14.940 --> 53:19.940]  The asterisk is that your iMessage key
[53:19.940 --> 53:24.940]  is stored in your iCloud backup.
[53:26.020 --> 53:28.220]  So your backup contains it.
[53:28.220 --> 53:33.100]  In theory, Apple could change iMessage
[53:33.100 --> 53:35.260]  to work like Keychain.
[53:35.260 --> 53:40.260]  And even if they keep the iCloud backups encrypted
[53:41.340 --> 53:43.540]  in a way where Apple has the key,
[53:43.540 --> 53:47.180]  they could and I believe should change iMessage
[53:47.180 --> 53:51.420]  so that the key isn't in your iCloud backup.
[53:51.420 --> 53:53.700]  And the downside to that would be
[53:54.620 --> 53:56.620]  if you're one of these users,
[53:56.620 --> 53:58.180]  and apparently I heard from a bunch of people,
[53:58.180 --> 54:00.220]  like people who work as geniuses in the stores
[54:00.220 --> 54:03.380]  and people who had friends and family who've encountered it,
[54:03.380 --> 54:06.300]  it truly is a common problem on a daily basis.
[54:06.300 --> 54:09.420]  Somebody said, like a listener of the podcast said
[54:09.420 --> 54:10.540]  that they were just in getting
[54:10.540 --> 54:14.380]  one of their Apple products serviced.
[54:14.380 --> 54:16.500]  And while they were waiting for the genius
[54:16.500 --> 54:18.780]  to go in the back and run the diagnostics,
[54:18.780 --> 54:21.500]  three different people came and their genius problem
[54:21.500 --> 54:23.940]  was that they couldn't access their iCloud backup.
[54:23.940 --> 54:25.020]  He said he couldn't believe it
[54:25.020 --> 54:27.700]  because he's reading during Fireball
[54:27.700 --> 54:30.380]  and listening to my podcast and other podcasts
[54:30.380 --> 54:32.100]  and it's a hot topic.
[54:32.100 --> 54:34.860]  And literally while he was at the genius counter,
[54:34.860 --> 54:37.380]  three people came up and needed access
[54:37.380 --> 54:41.420]  to their iCloud backups and they didn't know their password.
[54:41.420 --> 54:42.780]  Definitely a common problem.
[54:42.780 --> 54:44.420]  The downside would be those people
[54:44.420 --> 54:48.580]  wouldn't be able to access their archive of iMessages.
[54:48.580 --> 54:51.340]  You know, you'd have to start over.
[54:51.340 --> 54:54.820]  Which seems a reasonable thing to give up, as it were.
[54:54.820 --> 54:56.420]  Yeah, and I think most people sort of see
[54:56.420 --> 54:59.060]  their iMessages as sort of transient.
[54:59.060 --> 55:01.700]  So I kind of feel like that's sort of a,
[55:01.700 --> 55:04.500]  hopefully a, regardless of what Apple plans to do
[55:04.500 --> 55:08.380]  with the iCloud backups and who has the keys,
[55:08.380 --> 55:10.460]  I really think they should move iMessage to that
[55:10.460 --> 55:13.660]  because I think it's a good idea for privacy
[55:13.660 --> 55:17.380]  and I also think it would meet people's expectations
[55:17.380 --> 55:20.300]  for privacy with iMessage in the cloud.
[55:20.300 --> 55:22.220]  It's interesting because one of the reasons
[55:22.220 --> 55:27.220]  that law enforcement still wants more access from Apple
[55:27.900 --> 55:30.420]  is actually not necessarily iMessages
[55:30.420 --> 55:33.420]  because to your point, they can often be gotten to
[55:33.420 --> 55:36.940]  through iCloud backups, but other encrypted programs
[55:36.940 --> 55:40.220]  like WhatsApp or Signal or things along those lines
[55:40.220 --> 55:43.420]  where they want to turn on the phone
[55:43.420 --> 55:46.220]  because they do need actually that sort of access.
[55:46.220 --> 55:50.180]  Like WhatsApp is more secure than iMessage for this reason
[55:50.180 --> 55:55.180]  because it only goes via your device, right?
[55:55.260 --> 55:57.580]  And you notice this, if you want to use WhatsApp
[55:57.580 --> 56:01.140]  on your computer, it has to go through your device.
[56:01.140 --> 56:04.380]  Yeah, but it does, it has to go through your device
[56:04.380 --> 56:06.100]  so like your desktop thing is like sort of
[56:06.100 --> 56:10.180]  just a proxy to your phone, but your iPhone backup
[56:10.180 --> 56:12.020]  still contains whatever, I don't know.
[56:12.020 --> 56:13.780]  WhatsApp backups, that's right, he does.
[56:13.780 --> 56:16.940]  And I have to say I enjoy it,
[56:16.940 --> 56:18.580]  that's how they got Paul Manafort.
[56:19.620 --> 56:21.060]  That's right, that's right.
[56:21.060 --> 56:24.460]  Paul Manafort was committing crimes on his phone
[56:24.460 --> 56:26.760]  and thought he was being smart using WhatsApp
[56:26.760 --> 56:30.180]  because it's end-to-end encrypted, but they got him
[56:30.180 --> 56:35.180]  because they got his iCloud backup and then I laugh
[56:36.300 --> 56:38.700]  because I really don't like the guy in him.
[56:38.700 --> 56:41.900]  Well, I think it's really interesting though
[56:41.900 --> 56:43.940]  from a sort of a balanced perspective
[56:43.940 --> 56:48.380]  because what's the one thing in like,
[56:48.380 --> 56:51.420]  like you could use, you're right to draw that distinction.
[56:51.420 --> 56:53.620]  So if you want to use, you use like Signal or something,
[56:53.620 --> 56:57.580]  right, if you want to not have those issues.
[56:57.580 --> 57:01.580]  And so you have a choice as a user to figure out
[57:01.580 --> 57:03.500]  what's the right software to use
[57:03.500 --> 57:05.140]  that is truly encrypted, right?
[57:05.140 --> 57:08.260]  But what's the one thing you really can't control?
[57:08.260 --> 57:11.460]  You can't control like the hardware itself.
[57:11.460 --> 57:14.860]  Like is the hardware down to its very root?
[57:14.860 --> 57:16.460]  Is it secure?
[57:16.460 --> 57:19.520]  And so I think there's an argument to be made
[57:19.520 --> 57:22.340]  that Apple is actually in a very reasonable position
[57:22.340 --> 57:27.340]  where the one part of the entire sort of system
[57:27.340 --> 57:30.740]  that users can't control is the hardware itself
[57:30.740 --> 57:32.920]  and is the hardware itself secure or not.
[57:32.920 --> 57:35.860]  They can make choices about what cloud services they use,
[57:35.860 --> 57:37.740]  what messaging services they use.
[57:37.740 --> 57:40.460]  And so you can structure a truly secure
[57:40.460 --> 57:42.580]  messaging environment on your phone
[57:42.580 --> 57:44.340]  if you make all the right choices,
[57:44.340 --> 57:47.020]  but also because Apple made the phone truly secure.
[57:47.020 --> 57:49.460]  And so I think there's actually an argument to be made
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.340]  that Apple is actually exactly
[57:51.340 --> 57:52.580]  where they should be right now,
[57:52.580 --> 57:55.300]  where it is possible to be truly secure,
[57:55.300 --> 57:58.260]  but Apple's not necessarily gonna do all the work for you.
[57:58.260 --> 58:03.260]  And there's some, that's probably why WhatsApp
[58:04.100 --> 58:06.140]  is slightly less secure than Signal 2.
[58:06.140 --> 58:09.060]  It's not because Facebook wants to use the information
[58:09.060 --> 58:10.460]  to snoop on you or for ads.
[58:10.460 --> 58:14.820]  No, it's not actually wouldn't be useful anyway,
[58:14.820 --> 58:16.820]  and Facebook can't see the stuff.
[58:16.820 --> 58:20.860]  But they also sort of can be responsible corporate citizens
[58:20.860 --> 58:24.740]  as it were in a way that is not necessarily a burden
[58:24.740 --> 58:27.300]  nor should it be for Signal, right?
[58:27.300 --> 58:30.540]  Signal is, and I think it's a reasonable compromise
[58:30.540 --> 58:34.560]  because the bad guys are going to figure it out.
[58:34.560 --> 58:36.940]  The sort of dumb bad guys that sort of do crimes
[58:36.940 --> 58:39.820]  like Paul Manafort are not necessarily gonna figure it out
[58:39.820 --> 58:41.460]  and they can get caught,
[58:41.460 --> 58:43.780]  but also the people that truly need a secure environment
[58:43.780 --> 58:47.300]  that can figure out, can understand this sort of stuff,
[58:47.300 --> 58:49.940]  they can be truly secure as well, right?
[58:49.940 --> 58:53.620]  And so I think whatever your position on Apple
[58:53.620 --> 58:55.340]  and the iCloud backup point or Facebook
[58:55.340 --> 58:57.060]  and WhatsApp and those sorts of things,
[58:57.060 --> 58:59.400]  the fact of the matter is there's only one piece in here
[58:59.400 --> 59:01.340]  that users can't make a choice about,
[59:01.340 --> 59:02.460]  and that is the phone,
[59:02.460 --> 59:07.460]  and that is the part where Apple has done huge efforts
[59:07.700 --> 59:09.100]  to make it truly secure.
[59:09.100 --> 59:12.740]  And so while we can go back and forth in this middle area,
[59:12.740 --> 59:15.120]  I think Apple deserves acknowledgement
[59:15.120 --> 59:17.500]  for taking care of the one part
[59:17.500 --> 59:19.140]  that I as a user cannot take care of.
[59:19.140 --> 59:20.440]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.360]  And I think it's,
[59:26.180 --> 59:27.540]  so the way that you can,
[59:27.540 --> 59:28.960]  if you're really concerned about it,
[59:28.960 --> 59:31.100]  whether it's because you're committing crimes
[59:31.100 --> 59:35.940]  or really if, and this second part is much more reasonable,
[59:35.940 --> 59:38.740]  if it just is the nature of your personality
[59:38.740 --> 59:42.440]  that you are not comfortable with Apple having a key
[59:42.440 --> 59:44.820]  to your backed up data, totally reasonable.
[59:44.820 --> 59:46.440]  I know, I just know,
[59:46.440 --> 59:48.480]  I know the people who listen to the show
[59:48.480 --> 59:50.820]  and I know the sort of people who read during Fireball,
[59:50.820 --> 59:53.860]  there's a lot of you out there, totally reasonable position.
[59:53.860 --> 59:58.280]  And if you want your iOS life
[59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.860]  to be completely under your control,
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.040]  you should stop using iCloud backup.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.820]  And if you do want to back up your device,
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.900]  which you probably do,
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:11.100]  you can still back up to your Mac or PC through iTunes
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:14.300]  or now in Mac OS 10.5, you do it through the Finder,
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.620]  but it's the same, you look at it,
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.340]  it's the same interface you used to see in iTunes.
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:22.980]  And make sure you put a password on your backup, which-
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.060]  And then you can sync that backup via Backblaze
[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.180]  or whatever other service you want to use
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.760]  so you can have sort of cloud backups.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.820]  And you know what, I think that's totally reasonable.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.140]  Like the-
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.980]  Or Dropbox.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:36.460]  We're arguing about default, right?
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.100]  Because even if Dropbox is a subpoena,
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.340]  it's an encrypted file that you need the password
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.340]  to get into.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.740]  And I think we're arguing about defaults here, right?
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.480]  The reality is, is thanks to Apple's work on the phone,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.900]  you can live a fully encrypted life.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.060]  Is it a little more inconvenient?
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.720]  It is, but that's the trade-off, right?
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.620]  And I think it's reasonable to have that trade-off.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.860]  I was thinking about this when you said that
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.960]  you were talking about email
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.040]  and how it's sort of like fundamentally insecure.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.420]  And my business is sort of built on email in some respect,
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.260]  right?
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.100]  And what is attractive about it is,
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.100]  it is a fee that people check every day
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.100]  that I can get into for free, right?
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.220]  I don't need to pay a Facebook gatekeeper
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.420]  or whatever it might be to get access to people.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.120]  The email is open and free.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.900]  And that's part of the trade-off
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.220]  is it's because email is open and insecure
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.340]  that it is actually an accessible market
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.700]  for someone like me, for example,
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.580]  or that it's available anywhere and everywhere
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.100]  on any device.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.900]  And that's just the way these things work.
[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.660]  The more encryption you want, the more defaults you want,
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.200]  not only is there a societal issue,
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.940]  there's a walled garden issue, right?
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:47.460]  The more we put things, the more you lock things down,
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:49.760]  by definition, the less interoperability you're gonna have,
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.060]  the less you're gonna be able to sort of exchange data
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.460]  across different platforms,
[01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:57.300]  the more you're actually going to strengthen Apple's moats
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.660]  or strengthen Facebook's moat.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.380]  And so if you care about competition,
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.900]  you're actually, these encryption questions are actually,
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:05.420]  there's another trade-off to think about.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.300]  And it's okay, again, I just,
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.620]  I hate absolutism on any of this in any direction
[01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.340]  because there's reasonable trade-offs to make.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:17.940]  And I think we're in a good spot
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:21.320]  because you can go all the way when it comes to encryption,
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.800]  but you don't have to and it's not even the default.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.060]  And that's fine because as long as it's possible,
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.380]  I feel pretty good about things.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.460]  Yeah, and again, like you pointed out,
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.860]  you can still get cloud-based backup with your,
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.400]  I call them iTunes backups,
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.580]  but that includes the Finder one for Catalina,
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.420]  but the iTunes backup that is on your Mac or PC.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.640]  And it works over Wi-Fi too, right?
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.780]  So you don't even need to necessarily
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.940]  plug into your phone every day.
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.660]  It could just be when you come home every evening
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.740]  and it does that backup in the background.
[01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:52.260]  Right, and you kind of, at least even if you're doing that,
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:54.140]  you kind of need to double-check it once in a while
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.020]  because just to make sure it's still doing,
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.420]  you don't wanna be the guy who forgot
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.700]  that when you got a new MacBook Pro,
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.540]  you never made sure that was still working again
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:06.340]  and you haven't backed up for 13 months
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:07.180]  or something like that.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.420]  I mean, that is the advantage to iCloud backup
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.360]  is it just happens automatically every night
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.980]  as your iPhone is connected to a charger.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.660]  Even with the Wi-Fi backup, you need, like you said,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.040]  you have some personal responsibility
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.620]  to make sure it's working, but that's the trade-off.
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.920]  But you can store that backup and use Backblaze
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.940]  or Dropbox or something and there's nothing that can happen.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.500]  Nobody can get into it even when it's in Dropbox
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.220]  or even iCloud, you could even put it on iCloud Drive.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.860]  You just can't use iCloud backup.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.140]  And the other thing that I think is a little counter-intuitive
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.960]  I touched on it a couple minutes ago,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.960]  but if you're only backing up via your iTunes backup
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.960]  with a password, you can also use iMessage in the cloud
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.600]  in a completely secure way.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.440]  Because-
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.320]  Once you run off iCloud backups,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.640]  then the key's no longer there.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.400]  Right, because that, I don't wanna use the word backdoor,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.460]  but that asterisk for somebody to get into your iMessage
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.240]  in the cloud is because the key is stored
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.360]  in your iCloud backup.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.720]  And if you don't have an iCloud backup,
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.120]  they don't have a way to get that key.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.800]  I guess the other hole in that that you should think about
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.200]  if you're doing crimes is, okay,
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.200]  you've turned off iCloud backup
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.100]  and you're only encrypting to your Mac or PC
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.760]  with a password that only you know,
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.320]  but anybody you're communicating with by iMessage,
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.760]  if they're using iCloud backup
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:43.960]  and the feds know you're collaborating with them,
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.720]  they can subpoena their backup and, you know,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.200]  see your end of the messages
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.720]  because they're backing it up to iCloud.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.800]  So there is that to keep it in mind, but it's good.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.120]  Basically, it's good to know how all this works.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120]  And before the last month or so,
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.560]  I didn't even know how all this worked.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.360]  And I know just based on my reading
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.440]  that lots and lots of readers didn't know how it worked.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.600]  And a lot of people were very surprised to find out
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.940]  that Apple has a key to your iCloud backup.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.820]  And again, I don't think it's used willy nilly.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.080]  I don't know the process.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.520]  I'm not quite sure everything they do to verify your ID,
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.760]  but it's not like, you know,
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.000]  I do think that on their side in iCloud,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.640]  there is some sort of process and a logging, you know,
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.040]  like hopefully I would hope, you know,
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.540]  there's no way for a rogue Apple employee to, you know,
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.820]  spy on a ex partner or something like that,
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.520]  or stalk them or something like that, you know,
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.520]  that there's some kind of log of Apple employee access
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.320]  to these keys to do it.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.000]  But the fact that you don't know
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.120]  that we don't know how that works
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.720]  is one of the reasons why I emphasize
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.660]  that it's perfectly reasonable for someone to say,
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.560]  I don't want any part of this, if they can access my data.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.040]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.040]  Last but not least, I wanted to emphasize,
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.160]  I think I was wrong about it or it was ambiguous,
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.080]  but there's this whole thing where to get on your device,
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.640]  if law enforcement or a criminal or a Snoop
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.040]  or somebody has your iPhone,
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.440]  and they want to, they use one of these devices,
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.520]  you know, I guess it's mostly law enforcement,
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.940]  but one of these gray key devices or the celebrate thing
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.120]  where they jailbreak the phone
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.040]  and then try to brute force the password
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.280]  by circumventing the 10 guest limit.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.780]  Everything goes through the secure enclave
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.920]  and the big limiting factor,
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.540]  there's a key in the secure enclave
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.960]  that is part of the encryption.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.480]  So there's no way to go around it.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.180]  You know, it's not like, it's hard to understand.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.500]  I can't profess that I understand it perfectly,
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:43.660]  but I understand the idea that one of the keys
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.600]  that encrypts everything on your iOS device is,
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.600]  part of it is your password or your passcode,
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:50.420]  whatever you want to call it,
[01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.600]  but another part is a unique hardware key
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.640]  in the secure enclave that there's no way around it
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.680]  without that key, mathematically.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.160]  And there's an 80 millisecond per guess time,
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:10.280]  that's eight hundredths of a second, so roughly 12 guesses
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.080]  would get you to like 96, 0.96 of a second.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.120]  So roughly 12 guesses a second is the limit.
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.560]  That, the thing that I think I was ambiguous about
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.120]  writing about it on Daring Fireball
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.800]  is that the 80 millisecond thing
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.120]  isn't like an if statement in code,
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.040]  where it's like, okay, there was a guess,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.360]  and then the next guess comes in and there's like,
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.660]  if 80 milliseconds have passed, okay, process it,
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.040]  but if not, wait, and that somehow that could be hacked
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.460]  to either be longer, like make it three seconds,
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.480]  or in the case of someone trying to crack the phone,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.960]  set it to zero, and then it will process them
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:53.600]  as fast as they can, it's not like that.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.360]  It is, I'm 98% sure that the 80 millisecond thing
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.600]  is actually mathematically produced, it's, there are al-
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.760]  Well, what it is is the, there is a hardware key.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.200]  The thing with the Secure Enclave is,
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.600]  it's actually a processor, right?
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.480]  It's part of, like, it's like a mini computer
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.040]  in your computer, and it has its own software,
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.560]  by the way, also, and so this actually has
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.960]  a couple implications, because the,
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.480]  so you're right, it tangles a key that is burned
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.400]  into your phone when the phone is produced,
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.440]  and is undiscoverable, right?
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.840]  It's like, and so it's burned into your phone,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.240]  it's tangled with your passcode to create,
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.920]  like, a hash to encrypt all this sort of stuff,
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.560]  and what happens is, is the way that it's entangled
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.760]  to sort of untangle it, mathematically requires,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.840]  it's meant to be a super inefficient sort of calculation,
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.840]  so that it can't be done faster than 80 milliseconds,
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.920]  or 800 or whatever it is, it literally takes that long,
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.000]  and so it's not, to your point, it's not a software thing,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.560]  it's like, it's a math thing, it literally can't be done
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.040]  faster than however long it takes.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.120]  It's an algorithm Apple deliberately chose
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.680]  because it would take 80 milliseconds on the processor
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.280]  that's built into the Secure Enclave,
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.680]  there's no way around it.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.480]  So, the interesting thing that's a byproduct of that
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.000]  is the average time it takes for, like,
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.440]  one of these devices that has access,
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.340]  jailbroken access to the iOS computer,
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.840]  that can talk to the Secure Enclave computer,
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.760]  and try to make guesses as fast as it can,
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.240]  with this 12 guesses per second,
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.200]  how, what's the average time it would take
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.120]  to guess a passcode of different length,
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.300]  so you can just multiply how many characters are involved,
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.280]  raised to the power of how many of them there are.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:52.200]  So, if you just have a numeric passcode,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.160]  zero through nine, four digits,
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.160]  that's 10 to the power of four possible combinations, right?
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.400]  It's 10,000, zero, zero, zero, zero, two, nine, nine, nine,
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:09.160]  and then the average time, you just divide that by two
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.400]  and take a guess that, if you're guessing all of them,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.360]  half the time you're gonna guess one
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.840]  that's before you get halfway through.
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.320]  So, the average time it would take
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.640]  to guess a four-digit numeric passcode, seven minutes,
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.640]  six numbers is 11 hours.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.400]  So, that's the default option now.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.720]  If you'd buy a new iPhone and just set it up from scratch,
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.240]  Apple's going through the wizard,
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.600]  whatever you wanna call it when you start up,
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.040]  it basically steers you
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:40.240]  towards a six-digit numeric passcode.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.920]  It only takes 11 hours for one of these devices to guess it
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.880]  at that 80 milliseconds per second,
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.400]  and double it, go to 22 hours,
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.120]  and you'll exhaust the entire space,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.280]  so a maximum of 22 hours.
[01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.200]  Eight digits, if you go custom, 46 days,
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.680]  and then a 10-digit passcode, 12 years.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.040]  So, that's pretty good.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.260]  Right, not just digit,
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.840]  but you can do alphanumeric passcodes.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.160]  So, then you're dramatically increasing the space,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.480]  because now it's 36 possible characters.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.320]  Yeah, the other thing is you.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.940]  Well, no, actually, and if you go uppercase,
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.320]  now you're up to 62.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.600]  And if you just count a handful of punctuation characters,
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.600]  like underscores and hyphens and periods,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.680]  you can get up to 64, 65, 66 characters.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.480]  So, just, you know, these are numbers
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.660]  from Jack Nickus from the Times,
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.720]  but you can do the math yourself.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.100]  Like I said, if you just count a 66-character space,
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.700]  52 letters, uppercase, lowercase, 10 digits,
[01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.840]  and the dash, underscore, period, and comma,
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.360]  or the hash sign or something,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.040]  or a space, you know, space is easy to type,
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.800]  and is often good for memorizing passcodes.
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.280]  So, four-character alphanumeric, seven days,
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280]  six characters, 72 years.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.760]  That's, on average, 144 years to exhaust the whole thing.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.560]  And eight characters, just eight characters,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.600]  uppercase, lowercase, and digits,
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:09.040]  not even counting punctuation, 276,000 years.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.340]  So.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:13.620]  Right, and there's nothing Apple can do about it.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.980]  This is like the, I was so exhaustive in researching this
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.420]  with the San Bernardino thing,
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.600]  and I realized this time, I think,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.920]  because we've been talking about it, too,
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.200]  there was actually more stuff,
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.080]  this stuff has changed since then, too.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.860]  And one thing that's changed is, you know,
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.360]  what is done in the secret enclave
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.000]  and what's done via the OS.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.080]  And the OS still controls the, like,
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.520]  wipe the phone after X number of attempts.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.000]  And that's the big thing that they want to erase.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.800]  The other thing that I found out, actually,
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.000]  I wasn't clear on this,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.620]  and Apple got back to me about this,
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:47.920]  was the, there is, because it's a serial enclave,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920]  it's like a mini computer in your computer, right?
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.640]  People think about it as being sort of safe,
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.640]  but, like, we're dealing with a computer, right?
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.260]  And what it is is a mini computer
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.640]  with its own processor, effectively.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.380]  But that means it has its own software
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.640]  that's actually different from the OS software.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.400]  And that software can be updated.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.000]  You can update the software in the secure enclave.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.500]  However, you do need the password to update the software.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:15.360]  And so, theoretically,
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.520]  you could update the software in the secure enclave.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.520]  You still can't escape the mathematical reality
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:22.960]  of, you know, sure, decrypting this.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.760]  You could, but if you wanted to, like,
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.660]  maybe move the data to a different device
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:30.720]  that's faster, et cetera, that's still limited by,
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.040]  you would still need to change the software
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.240]  on the secure enclave itself,
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:35.080]  and that is limited by your passcode.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:38.260]  So, basically, Apple has made it so that it has to be,
[01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:43.260]  because of it's entangled with that hardware on the device,
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.120]  it has to be done on the device,
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:50.560]  which is mathematically limited to 80 milliseconds.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.640]  And so, if you make an alphanumeric password
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.200]  of X number of characters,
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.440]  it doesn't matter what the FBI does or what Apple does.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.040]  It's basically unbreakable.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.740]  Yeah, and so the eye-opening lesson from that
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.560]  is something I'd never really pondered before.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.360]  And I will say, until two weeks ago,
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.400]  I had been using a six-digit numeric passcode
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.680]  on my iPhone and iPad ever since six digits became available.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.720]  And before that, I was using four digits.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.320]  Partly out of laziness,
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.880]  partly out of the perfectly reasonable,
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.440]  and I'm not trying to say I'm virtuous,
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.900]  it's actually just that I'm very boring.
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.620]  There's nothing, there's not a lot on my phone
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.080]  that would be terribly upsetting for me
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.120]  if a thief cracked it and got.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:41.000]  I mean, especially without my iCloud keychain, right?
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  It still wouldn't get you into my Daring Fireball
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.840]  server account or something like that
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.000]  just because you got into my phone.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:50.840]  I don't know what I'm saying.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.680]  I would relish it.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.140]  I hope nobody does.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:57.000]  But my thinking until recently was six-digit passcode
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.100]  is good enough for me.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.400]  But when I saw these numbers and saw that it could be
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.820]  cracked in 11 hours on average and 22 at the max,
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.660]  I thought, you know what?
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.560]  I should do the right thing
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.180]  and switch to alphanumeric type of passcode.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.440]  But the thing that, to me, I wanna emphasize,
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:13.480]  and I think it's a good tip,
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.360]  is when you think about this 80-millisecond limit,
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.680]  what we all know about picking good passphrases
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.480]  doesn't really apply to this.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.280]  Like an eight-character, for most uses,
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.820]  when we're picking a new password for an online account,
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:31.480]  everybody, a lot of places won't even let you
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.040]  pick an eight-character passcode
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.940]  because they say it's not long enough.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.020]  Eight characters, as long as you're using
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:41.520]  uppercase, lowercase, and a digit or a punctuation mark,
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.640]  you're literally talking hundreds of thousands of years
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.820]  to crack.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:50.000]  I mean, you don't have to sacrifice a ton of convenience,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.280]  is what I'm trying to say,
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.620]  and pick a 15 to 20-character passcode
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.400]  with a couple of punct...
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.940]  And where you're typing it on the phone,
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.680]  you're shifting between all of these keyboards.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.800]  It makes it all the harder to type.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.200]  And you can't see what you've typed
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.640]  because they're coming up as bullets.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.360]  And so if you make a typo,
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.080]  you're typing it over and over again,
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.880]  you can err on the side of a very convenient passphrase
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.340]  that you wouldn't ordinarily use for most things
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.680]  and literally have your phone be secured
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.200]  for 100,000 years of cracking attempts.
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.040]  That's right.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.520]  Eight or nine characters, and you're really good.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.420]  Really good.
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:35.280]  Right, because those passcodes, generally,
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.520]  they're running them on supercomputers, right?
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.600]  And that's why they have to be super long and complicated.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.440]  Even then, they can, like, 80 milliseconds,
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.040]  it sounds like a small amount of time.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:47.680]  In computer world, it's just an astronomically long
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.520]  amount of time that you definitely use to your advantage.
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.360]  Yeah, and I'll just repeat something that Glenn emphasized,
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.240]  but it's worth remembering, is that asterisk,
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.860]  so long as you don't pick a dictionary word,
[01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:01.640]  where the dictionary isn't necessarily
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:02.960]  like the Scrabble dictionary,
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.520]  but like common dictionary of people's common passwords,
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:12.120]  like P-A-S-S-W-0-R-D.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.920]  Yeah, don't use that one.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.720]  Because any smart cracker is gonna run through
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.480]  commonly used passwords like that
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.800]  before they start guessing by iterating
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.000]  through all possible combinations.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.640]  So as long as you pick something that you can memorize
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.560]  and isn't a commonly used word or a password
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.400]  or your firstborn child's birth date
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.240]  in numbers with slashes,
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.440]  you are good for hundreds of thousands of years
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.140]  and you do not need, it's in fact counterproductive.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.160]  You're just wasting typing and thumbs and your time
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.480]  by picking a 20-character passphrase that you would use
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.680]  if you were setting up a new account online.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.340]  And this is for your phone password specifically,
[01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.120]  like your...
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.740]  Device passcode.
[01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.920]  And I have to say, now that I've changed mine
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.600]  to an alphanumeric, I have to say now
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.000]  it really has become clear how seldom I have to enter it.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.240]  Really, it really does not come up very often.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.920]  I had to do it today because I just upgraded
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.960]  to the new, there's a new iOS dot release.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.220]  And so I had to type it to allow the update to install
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.640]  and type it once the phone restarted.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.880]  And I was like, I haven't typed this in days.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.640]  Well, it turns out if you're in Asia
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.540]  and you're wearing a medical mask,
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:30.400]  you actually end up putting it in a lot
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.480]  because your face icon doesn't work anymore.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.800]  You know what, we'll have to touch on that after the break.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:35.620]  I have to take a break.
[01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.240]  But I just went out today, I have to tell,
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.000]  I should tell you the story.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.160]  I had to go to the post office today.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.080]  And on my way, I saw two Asian people.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.960]  I don't know, I have no idea if they're tourists.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.480]  I don't know if they live here, I don't know what,
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.100]  but they were Asian and they were wearing medical masks.
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.520]  And I'm just like, do you know something?
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:55.800]  I don't know.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.280]  I'm trying not to get freaked out
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:58.820]  by this whole coronavirus thing
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.680]  and not get, you know, there's a germaphobe in me
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.840]  that's dying to get out.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:07.740]  And I'm like, seeing people walking around the street
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.940]  with medical masks, I'm like, should I have one of those?
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:11.240]  Should I get one of those?
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.680]  I don't know.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:14.780]  I think you're okay with that one.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:15.820]  Yeah, I think so too.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.480]  But anyway, let me take a break and thank our next sponsor.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.520]  It's our good friends at Casper.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.200]  Casper makes sleep products.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.880]  What a weird category, but it's true.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.520]  That's what they make.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.960]  Designed by humans for humans.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:36.080]  Their products are cleverly designed to mimic human curves,
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.800]  providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.520]  Mattresses, that's where they started.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.120]  You spend one third of your life sleeping.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.000]  You should be comfortable.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.680]  You should have a great mattress.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.020]  You get it from Casper, you can get a great mattress
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.340]  without spending a lot of money.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:53.120]  They have their own team.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.360]  There's not like they buy like white label mattresses
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.080]  and just slap a Casper sticker on them.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.640]  They have their own sleep engineers, mattress engineers
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.720]  who design their mattresses.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.600]  Totally, like part of the tech industry.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.440]  They've got engineers.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.100]  Their original Casper mattress,
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:12.080]  that's the one that was the only Casper mattress
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.880]  for a while, combines multiple supportive memory foams
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.160]  for a quality sleep surface
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.000]  with the right amount of sink and bounce.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:18.840]  We've got one of those.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.080]  We got one of those way back in the day
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.040]  when Casper first started sponsoring the show.
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.440]  Still as good as new.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.480]  It is still, you wouldn't know it, it's a years old mattress
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:29.060]  still as good as new, absolutely lasts.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.260]  It's a great mattress.
[01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:33.260]  Has a breathable design, helps you sleep cool,
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.060]  regulates your body temperature throughout the night.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.320]  They also now offer two other mattresses,
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.360]  actually three other mattresses, I'm wrong.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:43.280]  They've got the Wave, the Essential and the Hybrid.
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.240]  I forgot about the Hybrid.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.680]  The Wave features a patent pending premium support system.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.880]  This is their high-end model.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.440]  It's a really, it's the high-end model
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.240]  but not a super high-end price.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.540]  Then they've got the Essential,
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.000]  that's their streamlined design
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.520]  at a price that quote, won't keep you up at night.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.080]  That's a lower price model, still a great mattress.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.520]  And then the Hybrid, that's the newest one.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:07.000]  It combines the pressure relief of the award-winning foam
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.200]  that their other mattresses have always been made with
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.760]  with durable yet gentle springs.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.840]  They also offer, this is what I talk about, sleep products.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.200]  They also offer a wide array of other products
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.840]  like pillows and sheets
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.520]  to ensure an overall better sleep experience.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.440]  And it's all designed, developed,
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.120]  and assembled right here in the US.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.200]  They've got affordable prices
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.860]  because Casper cuts out the middleman
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:32.680]  and sells directly to you.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.880]  Hassle-free returns if you're not completely satisfied
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.400]  and your mattress gets delivered right to your door
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.520]  in a unbelievably small, how do they do that sized box?
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.500]  Free shipping and returns in the US and Canada
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:46.740]  for our friends up north.
[01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:51.740]  They've got a 100-night risk-free sleep on it trial.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.320]  So if you're worried, which is perfectly reasonable,
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.300]  you think, well, how the hell am I gonna buy a mattress
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.840]  if I don't even try it?
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.920]  You can do it, sleep on it for over three months
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.220]  and decide whether you wanna keep it.
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:04.640]  And if you don't, they'll take it.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.160]  No questions asked, they'll come pick it up,
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.820]  give you all your money back.
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.420]  That's how confident they are
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:13.300]  that you're gonna love your Casper mattress.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.580]  We've got a couple of them in the house.
[01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:15.900]  I think we're up to three.
[01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.320]  We love them, they're just great.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.100]  We miss them when we travel and we come home,
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.140]  we're like, ah, back on our beloved Casper mattresses.
[01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.060]  We really do like them.
[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.740]  You can get, here's a special offer
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:28.660]  for listeners of the show.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.640]  You get $100 towards select mattresses
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.640]  by visiting casper.com, C-A-S-P-E-R, casper.com slash talkshow
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:39.940]  and using that same code as the URL slug talkshow
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.300]  at checkout and you will save 100 bucks
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300]  towards select mattresses.
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.940]  That's casper.com slash talkshow with the code talkshow.
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:52.480]  Terms and conditions, terms and conditions both apply.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.460]  Oh, I had to go to the post office, Ben.
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:00.820]  This is the type of story I usually tell
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.740]  at the beginning of a show.
[01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.060]  But I never had, do you have a P.O. box?
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.060]  I don't know what they've got over there in Taiwan.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.340]  I don't in Taiwan, I do have one in the U.S.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.460]  Yeah, I've never had one and I've always wanted one
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:14.220]  because I run a business and people wanna send me things
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:18.060]  and I, you know, I'm always, you know,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.540]  I'm a private person, I don't wanna send out
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.460]  my home address to anybody.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:24.860]  I live in a city, there's post offices nearby
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:25.980]  that's not really inconvenient.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:27.060]  Why don't I have a P.O. box?
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:29.460]  I always, I put it off for years, years now.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.980]  Years and years and years and I broke down,
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.880]  I went and got it.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:34.940]  Turns out the way you get one is you have to go
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:37.260]  to the web first, you gotta go to the USPS.com,
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:39.040]  you sign up for a P.O. box and you'd say
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.140]  which post office do you want it at and what size
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.300]  and then you can prepay right there over the web
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:47.300]  and then they tell you, print these two forms
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:49.740]  and then one form comes in when you print it.
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:51.660]  It already has all your info, it's nice, you know,
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.560]  it pre-fills a whole bunch of stuff like your name
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.860]  and your address and, you know, some kind of code
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.180]  that verifies that you've paid and then you gotta go
[01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.700]  to your post office with these forms and two forms of ID
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.860]  and then they give you the P.O. box.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:10.000]  So I go over there today, this is when I saw the pedestrians
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.380]  with their medical masks on, freaked me out
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.660]  and then I immediately started thinking,
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:14.700]  well, where's the number one place
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.900]  where you could pick up this virus,
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.180]  probably the freaking post office.
[01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:20.660]  I go in there and there's no line.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:24.280]  It's like, it feels like I've already won the jackpot, right?
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.220]  How many times in the U.S. you don't really go
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.340]  to the post office and see no line?
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.980]  No line, but there's only one person behind the counter.
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:31.860]  How's this possible?
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.300]  So I walk right up, got my paperwork, I got my ID.
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:38.460]  Takes, I don't know, more time than I would think
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.340]  given that all this paperwork's pre-filled.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:43.680]  More time than I would think to process, but I wait.
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.980]  And she says, all right, I gotta go find a key.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.660]  She disappears in the back.
[01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.260]  And meanwhile, one or two people
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.660]  have now gotten in line behind me.
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.960]  Still nobody else working.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:59.380]  Minutes pass and several minutes pass.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.180]  More people get in line.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.580]  I hear the jingling of keys
[01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.760]  behind wherever she's gone behind there.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.260]  I hear keys jingling, nothing.
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.180]  Finally, people start talking to me.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.740]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:16.300]  Like, what are we all waiting for?
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:19.140]  And I said, I'm getting a P.O. box.
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.140]  And they're like, well, where'd she go?
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.260]  And I said, she said she had to get a key.
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.260]  I'm starting to feel self-conscious basically, right?
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:29.260]  Because I'm holding them up.
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:31.040]  Even though I don't really think this is my fault,
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.320]  I feel like going to the post office for a P.O. box
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.140]  is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:38.020]  I start looking around and you can see the P.O. boxes
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.660]  and I start sort of mentally guessing how many they have.
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.900]  It looks to me as though they have at least 1,000.
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:46.620]  I would guess, if I had to, you know,
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.180]  like guessing jelly beans in a jar
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:49.820]  to win a raffle or something like that,
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:52.900]  I would guess maybe they have 2,000 post-op P.O. boxes.
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.860]  Doesn't seem like an unusual thing to do.
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.020]  And then at this point, I had like looked at my watch
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.200]  and 10 minutes pass.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.620]  10 full minutes.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.620]  I still hear keys jingling back there.
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:12.140]  And thankfully, I will say to my fellow Philadelphians
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:15.020]  who were there in line, I'm feeling very self-conscious.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.720]  Every single person was nothing but kind
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.780]  and everybody's laughing and joking.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.380]  Nobody was soured by this, but I have to say
[01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:26.520]  I felt very self-conscious about the whole thing.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:30.180]  Then she comes out and says, I couldn't find a key.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.260]  I'm gonna have to change the lock on a box.
[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:34.100]  Oh.
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.300]  And then she's like, so come back tomorrow.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.280]  That's where I left it.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.500]  These don't have a P.O. box.
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.780]  Well, yeah, but she gave me the keys.
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.700]  She gave me the keys to the lock
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.540]  that they were gonna put on the box.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.300]  So I have keys to a P.O. box, but I don't have a P.O. box.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:27:00.300]  Anyway, that was my afternoon.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.780]  We should just dig into iPad.
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:04.020]  What do you think?
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.820]  Well, yeah, time to start the show.
[01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:06.960]  Yeah, time to start the show.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.260]  An hour and a half in.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.560]  Yeah, yesterday, or no, not yesterday, two days ago
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:14.900]  was the 10-year anniversary of the event
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.840]  where Steve Jobs introduced the iPad.
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.860]  10's a nice round number.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:24.660]  Lots and lots of people remembering
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:25.780]  what it was like that day
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.300]  with people of the press who were there,
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.140]  people posting their original reviews,
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.920]  people saying where they think the iPad stands.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.580]  And I used it as an opportunity to get a lot off my chest.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.620]  And like you said, you and I have talked
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.180]  about this privately many times,
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.860]  and it's almost to the point where it's almost like,
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.360]  one of the reasons, and there were a couple of people
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.980]  who were like, where has this rant been?
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.100]  Why did it take you so long to write this?
[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.420]  I've been thinking the same thing for so long.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:57.940]  And part of it is I've got notes
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.760]  for a lot of complaints about the iPad.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.380]  And the director's commentary
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.360]  of Daring Fireball aspect of this show
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  is that I've been meaning to write deeply critical pieces,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.260]  a deeply critical piece about the state
[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:17.460]  of the iPad software for well over a year.
[01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:19.300]  And I haven't.
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.140]  I think wider than that.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:22.340]  We've been talking about this for a while.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.940]  Like I said, when you finally posted it,
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.220]  I'm like, didn't you already post this?
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.620]  Because we've been talking privately
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.500]  about this particular thing for ages.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.140]  And the pathology of it in the weird parts of my brain
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:40.340]  is that I've been thinking of it as a massive
[01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:45.260]  like four, five, 6,000 word epic Daring Fireball post
[01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:49.060]  where I get it all out at once in a single narrative
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.780]  that makes complete sense and convinces everybody
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:54.360]  from Tim Cook on down that, yes, this is all right.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.200]  We should change it all.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.340]  And here it is.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:58.700]  It's a home run that was hit out of the park.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.520]  And I started writing about the 10 year anniversary iPad.
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.180]  And I was like, you know what?
[01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:04.660]  I should just break the ice on this
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:07.360]  and just get the highest level part of it off my chest.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.900]  And I could do it in a couple hundred words
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:11.580]  and then just do the rest and follow up pieces.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.440]  And why in the hell did it take me three years
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.820]  to figure it out that that would be a much more effective
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:20.820]  way for me to actually get this off my chest?
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:25.340]  And it was funny because I wrote about it as well,
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:26.500]  building on top of you.
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:30.660]  And you could tell that because someone posted on Twitter
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:32.460]  like, oh, I could have let John have all the fun
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.580]  right with the iPad.
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.060]  I'm like, no, actually I said something cryptic in response.
[01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.980]  But the truth is you're like, okay, I've gotten this started.
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:44.380]  Can you please come in and jump on top of it?
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:47.980]  And so that was why I did as sort of an email daily update
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:49.980]  first and then switched it to being a public post,
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.420]  which is more, it's interesting to your point, right?
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.300]  To make something a public post is like,
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.260]  it feels so much weightier and more difficult
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.100]  than just dashing an email together.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:02.060]  And then you like, so switching from one that was,
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:03.020]  dashed together is not right.
[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:06.380]  But when I write the daily update for subscribers,
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:08.500]  by definition, they're people who have been reading me
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.180]  for a while and they kind of already know
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.180]  where I'm coming from on certain issues.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:16.740]  And so you can presume a certain sort of like leeway,
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.660]  as opposed to like when you're writing a public article
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.620]  or it might be the first article they read on your site
[01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.020]  and you wanna be much more,
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.340]  have everything wrapped up in a bow
[01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:26.940]  and all the things tied together.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:29.740]  But I kind of felt the same way as you is like,
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:32.140]  once you had written it, I'm like, oh wait,
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.260]  I've been wanting to say all this stuff too.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.500]  So I'm just, I'm jumping on and it's gonna be out there
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:38.980]  and we're gonna podcast about it.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.340]  So I might as well make it public.
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.020]  So here we are.
[01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:45.380]  And to say that reaction was mixed is an understatement.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.660]  I would almost say it was so bifurcated.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:48.780]  I expected it though.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.580]  It was so bifurcated and I got more,
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.860]  yes, I agree with this here, here.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.980]  Finally, somebody is saying what I've been trying to say
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.660]  sort of reactions.
[01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:03.660]  But I also got a bunch of you're just an old guy
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.460]  who loves the Mac and you don't get it sort of things.
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:11.420]  A couple of them, they all mentioned the word old.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:17.860]  And part of that is a frustra, it's just human nature,
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.820]  but I find it deeply frustrating.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:21.700]  And it's this aspect of human nature
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.940]  where everybody is drawn towards,
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:28.620]  and I do feel like our society and internet culture
[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:32.780]  has only added a lot of fuel to the fire
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:35.860]  of this natural impulse to make everything
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.700]  black or white binary.
[01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.260]  It is the greatest thing ever
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:43.140]  or it is a total piece of steaming garbage, everything.
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:47.740]  What do you think of the rise of Skywalker?
[01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:49.780]  Great, great Star Wars movie, I love it.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.060]  Or it is J.J. Abrams should be put in prison.
[01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:54.060]  This is awful.
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.860]  This is the worst movie ever made, right?
[01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.140]  That's what people are drawn to.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.140]  That's how internet reactions have gone.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.300]  And despite the fact that I emphasized
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:07.060]  that the iPad is a beloved, something I like,
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.940]  something I use every day,
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.100]  something that I realized that a lot of people,
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.300]  it's their most beloved personal computing device
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.460]  and they're very effective and efficient with it,
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.980]  something that I called great even,
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.340]  but also has serious flaws.
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:23.020]  You have to be willing to accept nuance
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.340]  in my criticism of the iPad.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:27.900]  Did not register with people who love the iPad,
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:28.740]  or at least some.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.020]  Oh, it's so true.
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:33.820]  And I'll verify, you are one of the heaviest iPad users
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.500]  that I know personally.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.700]  Like you're, like this is a, it's not a,
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.860]  like I'm the one that's more dismissive about it
[01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.060]  in many respects.
[01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:45.580]  I actually used it less than I did before.
[01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.500]  But no, just to your point,
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:52.140]  what people, neither of us are saying it's a failed product.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:54.540]  It's a, it's what it,
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:57.340]  it's not everything it could have been, right?
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.020]  And this is one of the hardest to your,
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.740]  I get this, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:05.700]  It's like, you have to look at something not as it is,
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:08.420]  but what it, as it could be,
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:12.060]  and it's okay to recognize and bemoan
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.620]  that there's some sort of potential
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:17.700]  or some sort of possibility that was perhaps not reached.
[01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:21.900]  Yeah, and I am a self-professed Mac person,
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:23.580]  and I probably always will be,
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.620]  and even in the hypothetical universe
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:29.340]  where the iPad 10 years in was much closer
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:32.340]  to its potential of where it could be 10 years in,
[01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.100]  still probably would be a Mac person.
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.860]  But I would rather be in that world
[01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:43.180]  because I'd rather have it be a fair fight.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:46.220]  Whereas the things that really frustrate me about the iPad
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.940]  aren't even a fair fight compared to the Mac.
[01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:51.220]  And I don't see how anybody could deny it.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:55.100]  And I do, I don't wanna generalize, I really don't.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:34:00.100]  But to put Apple computing users into three buckets,
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:07.100]  and I realize that lots and lots of them are in all three,
[01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:10.620]  or at least two, but there's iPhone users,
[01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.980]  and there's iPad users, and there's Mac users.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.380]  And again, I'm all three.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:17.300]  Lots of people are, almost everybody has an iPhone, right?
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.100]  There's very few Apple, people in the Apple ecosystem
[01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.060]  who don't at least have an iPhone.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.780]  Maybe it's their only device,
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:25.980]  or maybe it's the one thing they have in addition
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:27.260]  to a Mac or an iPad.
[01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:30.740]  But people who use the iPhone,
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.580]  so I'm not saying that they're three different groups,
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.500]  but I'm just saying people who use the iPhone
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:38.420]  will complain about aspects of the iPhone interface.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.100]  Mac users, we've been complaining about the Mac all along.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:46.940]  Like nobody is a bigger and more astute critic
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.980]  and loves to complain about aspects of the Mac.
[01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:54.900]  Going back to 1984, then people who love the Mac the most.
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.780]  The people who love the Mac the most
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:59.100]  are the most astute critics of everything
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.300]  that's wrong about the Mac.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:05.300]  Look at John Syracuse's epic Ars Technica reviews of it,
[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.860]  which would talk about new features,
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:13.580]  and when they were confusing or wrong or slow or whatever,
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:16.900]  he was the one who wrote the most words about them.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.900]  iPad users, not all, like Federico Vittucci,
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:25.140]  to his credit, who is probably the most efficient
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.900]  iPad user I've ever heard of,
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.500]  has built his entire, he's a super productive person
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:35.180]  who writes thousands and thousands of words a week
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:37.660]  and does podcasts and does all this work on his iPad
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:42.260]  and shares his techniques and shortcuts
[01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:44.140]  and stuff like that to his readers.
[01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:45.300]  It's a lot of what he writes about
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.900]  is at the meta level of how to be an iPad power user.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.180]  Is also, it fully acknowledges some of the things
[01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:55.140]  that I'm talking about as shortcomings.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.340]  So there's certainly not everybody.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.260]  That's what I mean about not generalizing.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:01.580]  But boy, oh boy, are there a lot of people out there
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:04.820]  who love their iPads, use it as their primary
[01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:07.100]  computing device, and do not want to hear
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.620]  one bad word about it.
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:15.020]  There is a sort of emperor's new clothes aspect to it
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:17.180]  where they're like, hey, these people who are saying
[01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:20.540]  the emperor is buck naked, they're just haters.
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.620]  Well, I think it's interesting, because you get this
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:26.140]  with Apple just sort of as a whole,
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:29.460]  where Apple is part of people's,
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.420]  like there's no other company where people
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.060]  who have Twitter handles, that includes
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:35.380]  the company's logo in them, right?
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:37.020]  There's an aspect of Apple that ties
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.580]  into people's identity, like they're an Apple person.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:42.460]  And I think that is taken to 11
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:44.100]  when it comes to the iPad, right?
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:49.100]  If you're an iPad person, that's what you do.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.420]  Like you have made this commitment,
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.620]  you've made it the center of your life,
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:55.260]  you're living in the future, you're not an old fogey,
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:58.180]  you're using a Mac or a PC.
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:01.340]  And it's not something that you do sort of like,
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.860]  I don't know, again, a real danger in writing online
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.780]  is something you have to learn as an author very early
[01:37:07.780 --> 01:37:09.300]  is that your Twitter commenters
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.540]  are not your core readership, right?
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.620]  It's sort of a fraction of the fraction.
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:16.020]  But I think there is an aspect where
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:19.860]  all the things that you and I both know
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.300]  are the case for sort of Apple fans
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.140]  is just double the case when it comes
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:26.500]  to being sort of an iPad person.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.100]  Yeah, like if you run a restaurant,
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:30.460]  the people who want to speak to the manager
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.900]  aren't necessarily indicative
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:34.300]  of the entire clientele of the restaurant.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.860]  Right.
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:38.420]  But I...
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:40.340]  But it's funny because there's an argument
[01:37:40.340 --> 01:37:42.060]  where that sort of makes the point, right?
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.780]  Like, why would it be part of your identity
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:46.380]  if it's something that's super accessible
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.180]  and easy for everyone to use, right?
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.700]  There's an aspect where it is special
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:53.820]  to use the iPad for all of your computing.
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.420]  And the reason it's special is our entire point.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.740]  It shouldn't be so special.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.860]  It should be more broadly accessible.
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:01.300]  Yeah, absolutely should be.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:04.140]  And I really do find it hard.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.660]  I think that the only...
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.980]  One of the reasons that we find ourselves
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.420]  in this situation 10 years in
[01:38:11.420 --> 01:38:14.980]  is that I think there has to be a contingent within Apple
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:18.140]  that is within Apple who is the same way,
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:20.500]  who thinks this is fine.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.620]  Because look at our sales.
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:25.700]  We're selling 10, 11, 12 million of the things
[01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.220]  every quarter, quarter after quarter.
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.460]  And there's so many things to love about it
[01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.820]  and that these other things, they must be fine.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:36.780]  And they're not fine.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.060]  Some of these things are truly screwed up.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.460]  And one of the things I devoted my attention to
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.340]  in my piece this week is the multitasking interface.
[01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.460]  And I tried to make it clear.
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.300]  I think it was clear.
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.460]  It doesn't seem like people were confused.
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.660]  But when I talk about multitasking with iPad,
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.340]  what I mean is putting two apps on screen at a time.
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:57.500]  It is in the user interface sense
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.660]  of seeing two things at a time,
[01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:02.620]  whether it's side-by-side apps or slide over
[01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.540]  or side-by-side with slide over.
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:06.140]  A couple of people pointed out that
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.380]  you can show two and only two apps at a time is wrong
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:10.420]  because you can have two apps on screen with split screen
[01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.740]  and then do a slide over.
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:15.380]  All right, you got me.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.660]  That's what I mean by multitasking.
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.700]  I don't mean it in the computer science sense
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:25.660]  because we've had quote, unquote, multitasking
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.260]  in the computer science sense of multiple processes
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:30.060]  running on the iPad all along.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:33.180]  There've always been background processes running
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:35.460]  to get new mail or to have incoming SMS
[01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.620]  or phone calls answered and stuff like that.
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:39.260]  So, you know.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.220]  Right, the phone multitasks, right,
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.380]  in sort of a technological sense.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:44.220]  Right.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.060]  But that's not what you're referring to.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.340]  But the split screen stuff,
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.420]  putting two apps on screen at a time,
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:50.820]  is, in my opinion, a fiasco.
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.220]  I really, and part of me procrastinated
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.260]  on getting this off my chest because, like I said,
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:02.300]  I wanted to do too much at once in one epic piece.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.780]  I wanted to hit one baseball
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.300]  that literally went out of Yankee Stadium,
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.260]  not just knock a couple singles up the middle
[01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:10.780]  over a period of a couple days
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:12.980]  and score some, you know, win a couple games,
[01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:14.300]  which is what I think I should've done
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.260]  and gonna try to do going forward.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:22.580]  But it's bad and it's confusing.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.220]  And I mean, I got so many responses from people
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.100]  who I know are smart, really smart technical users,
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.940]  people who, you know, Jeremy Zawadny,
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:37.260]  who wrote, literally wrote like the O'Reilly book on SQL.
[01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:39.940]  Like, was like, yeah, I had no idea how to,
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.700]  I had no idea you could get two apps on screen
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:43.060]  at once on an iPad.
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:45.700]  I mean, really smart people who either,
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:46.900]  A, didn't know how to do it,
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:49.500]  or like me, sometimes get into it
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:50.780]  and don't know how to get out of it.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:54.540]  Like, God forbid you end up with two instances of Safari
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:57.260]  with two different sets of tabs and then you,
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.340]  oh my God, it's like, where the hell is the one that's open?
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:02.380]  It's like, oh, there's two versions of Safari now.
[01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.860]  It reminds me of like the old versions of Windows,
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:08.020]  like Windows 3, you could like click Excel
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.180]  and then Excel is running.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.180]  And if you click the Excel icon again,
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:13.140]  it doesn't open Excel,
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.860]  it would open another instance of Excel.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.540]  And you can have like multiple documents in both instances.
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:20.940]  And it's like, who the hell thought that was a good idea?
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:23.340]  Well, that's the iPad, the iPad does that.
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:25.860]  You can have like two completely different instances
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.580]  that you can't get together.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.740]  And if you connect a hardware keyboard
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:32.580]  and you hit Command-Tab, it acts like it's a Mac
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:35.820]  or a Windows computer and just shows one icon
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:38.780]  for every app that's running and you go to Safari,
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:41.380]  but you have two instances of Safari running
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:44.260]  in your iPad spaces, which one comes forward?
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:46.900]  Well, toss a coin because I can't figure out
[01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:48.140]  what the heuristic is,
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.420]  and there's no way to get to the other one via Command-Tab.
[01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.980]  It is really confusing.
[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:57.780]  I mentioned my mom who has somehow,
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:59.380]  I don't know what exactly she's done.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.140]  It typically involves mail.
[01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.700]  I think for the most part, my mom uses,
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:05.900]  she uses her iPad a lot.
[01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.540]  Let me just emphasize that.
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.420]  In a house with an iMac, my dad's more of an iMac guy.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.380]  I think he likes having the big screen.
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:16.220]  My mom really loves her iPad.
[01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.420]  I mean, just really, really loves it.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:19.740]  She thrives on it.
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.140]  She does more computing than she did before.
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.860]  Just for the record, she's 74 years old.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:28.460]  Very smart, but not technically inclined at all.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:31.620]  Sort of defensive about her lack of technical inclination,
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:33.540]  is always afraid that she's broken something.
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:34.980]  When she first called me with this problem,
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.340]  she was convinced she broke her iPad
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:39.500]  because she'd go to mail,
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:43.300]  and now mail was side-by-side with Safari
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.100]  in a little skinny iPhone-sized window.
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:48.540]  Didn't know how to get out of it.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.180]  I explained how she could drag the divider
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.740]  to make mail go full screen again,
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.780]  but then every time she'd just tap a link in mail,
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:58.900]  it would open again in split screen in Safari.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:02.380]  And she was confused and didn't know how to get out of it,
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:04.700]  and it's a very, very difficult thing
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.100]  to talk somebody through on the phone.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.020]  Much more difficult than any Mac thing
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.460]  I've ever talked her through in 15, 20 years
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.820]  of talking my mom through any kind of problem.
[01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.780]  Over the years, they've made it harder to do this now.
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.820]  When you drag an icon out of your dock on the Mac,
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.900]  you have to drag it a lot further away
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:25.300]  before it'll poof and vanish.
[01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.780]  If you just drag it.
[01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:28.660]  I think by default it might be impossible.
[01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.500]  I can't remember.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:32.060]  No, if you drag it really far away, it'll poof away.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.740]  But in the old days, if you just dragged it out of the dock,
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.500]  like one of your saved icons,
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:39.420]  I want Safari always in my dock.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:44.020]  Well, you'd mouse, not an expert mouse user,
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:46.300]  maybe, or my dad did it.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.660]  Instead of clicking Safari, clicked and held a little bit,
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.980]  then moved the mouse, and then Safari poofed out of the dock.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.980]  And then from my parents' perspective,
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.780]  if it's not in the dock, it's gone, right?
[01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.460]  Like the phone call, dad deleted Safari.
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.740]  I could talk them through that though, right?
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:06.380]  I could talk them through using Spotlight or something
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.820]  to get Safari, and then just drag it back into the dock,
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:10.660]  and there it is.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:11.860]  I could talk her through it on the phone.
[01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:15.580]  Talking somebody like my mom through this
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.500]  split-screen stuff is madness,
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:20.300]  because one of the things I didn't mention,
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.580]  but I want to write about is the fact
[01:44:22.580 --> 01:44:27.060]  that it's all gesture-based, almost all.
[01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:30.460]  And there's no visual on-screen controls.
[01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:33.980]  Just think about like on the Mac with Windows.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.460]  And I'm not saying that iPad should have draggable windows
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:40.420]  that overlap, but I think they could learn some stuff
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:41.260]  from the Mac.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.660]  So in a Mac, no matter what app you're in,
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.620]  and you have a window open, how do you close it?
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:50.700]  Well, there's a red button up in the upper left-hand corner,
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.700]  and if you click that red button, the window closes.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.540]  And everybody knows it.
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:58.380]  Nobody doesn't know it.
[01:44:58.380 --> 01:44:59.740]  And it doesn't matter what app you're in,
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:00.980]  there's a red button up there,
[01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:03.380]  and you can click that button and close it.
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.660]  And yes, I know that you can switch to the Graphite theme
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.620]  and it'll be gray buttons,
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:09.980]  and I've run in Graphite mode over the years on and off,
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.900]  but normal people don't even know that's possible
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.460]  and would never want to run in the Graphite mode
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.300]  where it's a gray button.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.420]  There's always a red button.
[01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:18.300]  You can click it, it closes the window.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:20.500]  How do you close one of these split-screen panels?
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:21.340]  Good luck.
[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:24.980]  Sometimes you can drag the divider.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:26.380]  If it's on the left, you can't.
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.180]  You can't just close it.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.860]  It's crazy.
[01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.060]  Anyway, the good news about this, this is after.
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:34.340]  My mom actually read the thing on Daring Fireball,
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:36.060]  and then she saw that I mentioned her.
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.860]  She called me up and she said,
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.220]  hey, guess what, I figured it out.
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:41.700]  Because one thing, I guess I knew this and I forgot it.
[01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.660]  There is in fact a setting on the iPad,
[01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:45.700]  and it's not in accessibility.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:47.780]  And the fact that it's not in accessibility to me
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.620]  is sort of like a tacit admission
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:52.260]  that this multitasking stuff can be confusing.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:56.100]  You can go to settings, and then what's it called?
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:57.900]  Let me make sure I get it right.
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.900]  Settings, home screen and dock,
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:05.260]  and then you hit multitasking
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:07.100]  and you can just allow multiple apps.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:09.140]  You can just turn it off.
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.820]  She figured that out on her own.
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.660]  And then once you turn that off,
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.940]  you can't do slide over or split screen multitasking.
[01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.180]  Just doesn't happen.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:21.260]  And for me, one of the big advantages to that
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:23.780]  is when you're in Safari and you tap and hold a link
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.780]  and there's like a context menu that comes up.
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:29.100]  And what I usually wanna do is tap open a new tab.
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:32.060]  But when you have allow multiple apps on,
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.100]  right next to open a new tab is open a new window.
[01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:36.940]  And you say you can accidentally tap that
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:40.860]  because it's one finger width away.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.780]  And now all of a sudden you're stuck with two instances
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:44.580]  of Safari, ugh.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.380]  Anyway, my mom figured it out on her own
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:49.220]  and turned that off and wanted me to let everybody know
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:51.020]  that she's no longer bedeviled
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:55.380]  by split screen iPad multitasking
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.980]  because she turned it off.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.620]  Just getting, and just think about the fact
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:04.460]  that on the Mac, nobody ever wants to turn off
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.140]  the ability to show two apps at the same time.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:10.300]  Nobody, nobody's ever been bedeviled
[01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:14.340]  by the fact that there's a Safari window peeking out
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.460]  behind your mail window.
[01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:19.260]  Nobody's ever been bedeviled or confused by this.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.180]  Nobody ever wants, boy, I sure wish I could turn that off.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.180]  So what I did to sort of follow up on this
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:31.580]  was sort of think about how we got to this point, right?
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:34.300]  Like why is it that Apple went in this direction?
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:37.900]  And you go back to the beginning.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.060]  And this is why the 10-year period
[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.260]  was a great time to look back
[01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.300]  because you go back and think about the way
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:46.740]  that Jobs talked about the iPad
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:49.100]  and what it was positioned as.
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:53.860]  And there is this, the iPad was the,
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:56.260]  all it is is the screen, right?
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:01.140]  It is the sort of the essence of a computer.
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.500]  John Circus talks about the naked robotic core.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.380]  Like this is the, this is what it is.
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:09.740]  And it was so transformational and impressive
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:12.940]  because it becomes whatever you want it to be.
[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.500]  And in a way that a Mac never can, right?
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:18.020]  To your point that there's gonna be a lot of Chrome
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:19.260]  on a Mac, not the browser,
[01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:22.380]  but all the infrastructure and detritus
[01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:24.900]  of the sort of user interface is always there.
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:26.580]  And it needs to always be there
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:29.820]  because that's how you manage sort of the complexity
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.700]  of what you can accomplish on the Mac.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.540]  Whereas the iPad is something completely different.
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:37.380]  The iPad, it becomes a music studio.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:39.940]  It becomes an editing application.
[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.540]  It becomes a drawing surface,
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:44.620]  like which is remains my biggest use case for the iPad.
[01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:46.660]  I do the drawings for Shekri on it.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:48.980]  It becomes a TV, right?
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:52.780]  Either of these cases I'm watching NBA games on it, right?
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:57.060]  And this is such a powerful, powerful concept
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:00.420]  and it's distinctly different than what a Mac is.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.780]  A Mac is a tool for doing different things.
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:07.620]  An iPad is a, not an illusionist,
[01:49:07.620 --> 01:49:08.900]  what's the word I'm looking for?
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.180]  A chameleon?
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:14.420]  Like it becomes whatever the thing that you're doing is.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:18.940]  And the reason why,
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:20.660]  we'll get to how we got there in a moment,
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:24.260]  but the reason why I think the multitasking idea
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:27.860]  and model on the iPad is fundamentally flawed
[01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:32.580]  is it imposes the chrome,
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.820]  the detritus of the operating system
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:39.820]  onto a surface that ought to be a transformative,
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:43.340]  shape-changing sort of thing, right?
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.980]  And you lose that.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:50.820]  You lose that ability for an iPad to change what it is
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:54.780]  because you're imposing this sort of stuff on top of it
[01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:58.900]  that doesn't make sense in the context of that
[01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:00.260]  sort of view of it.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:03.540]  Yeah, but I'll acknowledge, I will acknowledge,
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:06.140]  because people keep saying, one of the responses is,
[01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.060]  well, I use the split screen thing.
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:10.100]  I use my iPad all day, it's my main computer,
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:12.340]  and I love the split screen.
[01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.460]  Nobody's defended the actual interface.
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.940]  Nobody has said it's a fantastic interface
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:19.020]  for getting two apps on screen at once.
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.700]  They just say that they love the capability
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700]  because they do use it.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:27.620]  They love having their notes open next to a video.
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.500]  They're watching a video and they're taking notes
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:31.540]  on the video because they can split screen it
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.020]  or something like that.
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:36.420]  I get that, and I do think it should be possible,
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.540]  but I just think it should be possible in a way
[01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:43.100]  where it should be super easy and obvious
[01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.500]  how you get back to one thing at a time
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:47.660]  that transforms the device.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:52.460]  You emphasized in your piece the GarageBand demo,
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:56.460]  which wasn't from the original iPad event.
[01:50:56.460 --> 01:50:59.140]  It was the iPad 2 event one year later,
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:03.460]  and it was one of Jobs' last on-stage appearances.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:07.780]  He was at WWDC then, which was his last on-stage appearance.
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:10.420]  But the GarageBand demo really was an app.
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.340]  I just haven't had time.
[01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:14.340]  I did a lot of writing.
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.580]  I didn't sit down and watch the whole iPad intro again.
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:19.780]  It's on my list for something to do this week,
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:23.420]  probably maybe the weekend, but I did watch that.
[01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.780]  And I do have to say, man,
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.740]  I do remember being blown away by that.
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:30.860]  That GarageBand demo from the one year in thing
[01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:32.980]  was really, really interesting,
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:36.620]  totally counter to that narrative that runs to this day
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:40.300]  that it's a device for consumption, not for creation.
[01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:41.780]  And the point you made that was so great
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:46.300]  is the GarageBand on iPad was immersive
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:49.140]  and transformed the device in a way
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:51.780]  that GarageBand from Mac never could,
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:54.500]  just by the definite, like it just,
[01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:58.700]  all of a sudden, the iPad is a piano, right?
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.940]  It doesn't look like a piano,
[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:02.500]  and you use a mouse to click keys,
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:06.660]  or you type keys on a physical, a QWERTY keyboard,
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:08.540]  and it simulates piano keys.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:10.020]  It just turns into piano keys,
[01:52:10.020 --> 01:52:13.180]  and you touch them, and they go down, and it makes music.
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:16.500]  It was incredible, and like the,
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.300]  I mean, we can get into it in a moment.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:20.660]  I actually, I would go much further than you.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:25.380]  I think that even having the sort of multitasking capability
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:28.860]  on the iPad is a mistake in what we're talking about.
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.740]  So that's obviously much more controversial to take,
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.580]  but just to follow up on this,
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.220]  there's a lot of pushback on,
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:39.700]  oh, the iPad is for creation, not just consumption.
[01:52:39.700 --> 01:52:41.420]  If you go back and watch the first one,
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:44.020]  it's clearly framed as a consumption device, right?
[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:49.020]  The, like, Jobs literally sat on a couch for the demo
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.500]  because he wanted to emphasize
[01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:55.300]  that it is more of a layback, lean back sort of experience,
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:59.020]  as opposed to a lean forward, at your desk,
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:00.380]  you know, sort of Mac experience.
[01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:04.300]  And so, like, it's not a, and for good reason.
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:06.540]  It's an amazing consumption device, right?
[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.020]  The, you know, for, again,
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:11.860]  I use it all the time for watching sports.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:14.940]  Like the, that's what I, you know, because I'm international,
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:18.700]  so I watch it through WigPass and LOB.TV and whatever,
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.300]  and I do use it on the iPad, and it's great for that.
[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.980]  And you can take it with you, and it's a great experience
[01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:25.700]  where having a larger screen than your phone
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:27.180]  is really super desirable,
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.020]  because you want to see things clearly,
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:32.020]  you know, kids watching Netflix or YouTube
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:32.860]  or whatever on it.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:35.060]  Like, it's an amazing consumption experience,
[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:36.260]  and it remains that.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:38.660]  And I think as far as we can tell,
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:41.620]  that is what even today, 10 years on,
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:44.660]  the vast majority of iPads are used for.
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:48.860]  And so, it's not, I think there was a sense for a while
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:51.900]  where, you know, people writing about Apple
[01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.700]  were sort of defensive about the iPad being called
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:56.260]  a consumption device.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:57.940]  But actually, that's what it is, right?
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.100]  Like, first and foremost.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:01.260]  And that was there on day one.
[01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:03.260]  And it's embraced so far across the line.
[01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:05.780]  I mean, MLB has always been at a technical level
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.460]  ahead of the other sports leagues in the US.
[01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.500]  I don't know why.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:14.260]  Maybe because they were in decline in popularity,
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:17.100]  you know, and it is the, you know, it's the oldest sport.
[01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.900]  But like the MLB team, you know, was the ones,
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.260]  they were the ones who solved the problem.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:25.020]  Like when HBO first started trying to stream video
[01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.460]  and servers burst into flames
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.260]  by people trying to watch Game of Thrones,
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.180]  they went to the MLB team.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:32.860]  And the MLB team were the ones
[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.100]  who figured out how to stream it.
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.980]  And then Disney bought that business from MLB
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:39.140]  because I actually think that their technology
[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:41.740]  probably is at the heart of Disney Plus
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:42.660]  now that I think about it.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:43.500]  I hadn't really thought about it.
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:44.340]  That's right, it is.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.580]  Disney acquired them, yeah.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:48.380]  And it's very strong technology.
[01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:49.700]  It's really strong.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:51.900]  And if you're impressed by the fact that Disney Plus
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:55.140]  launched with all this fanfare and went off seamlessly
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.020]  and you just hit play on Mandalorian
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.340]  and it just comes up and plays,
[01:54:58.340 --> 01:55:01.420]  it's thanks to the technology they acquired from MLB.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:04.580]  Yeah, it's really, yeah, I was pretty sure
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:05.660]  that they're at the heart of that.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:07.620]  Really, really, really strong technology
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:08.780]  leads the industry.
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:09.980]  I mean, it's up there.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:11.340]  I mean, I know Netflix is great too,
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.940]  but it's as good as it gets.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:14.980]  You talk to Netflix engineers and they will say,
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:16.940]  yeah, the only other streaming technology worth a crap
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.060]  is the, it's called BAM Tech now.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:25.260]  Yeah, what was BAM, Baseball Advanced Media
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:26.100]  or something like that?
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.060]  But they just went with,
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:30.660]  because it's no longer just baseball, it's yeah, BAM Tech.
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:34.740]  NBA, culturally, is certainly far ahead of the other leagues
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:37.700]  in terms of being up to date and embracing social media.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:41.420]  I mean, NBA Twitter is like no other sports Twitter
[01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:42.980]  and we could do a whole show on that
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:45.660]  and I know you'd probably spend 12 hours a day
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:48.420]  with your No Tech Bend Twitter account on it.
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:50.620]  So it's not surprising to me that the NBA
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:52.820]  also has a really good streaming experience to iPads.
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:54.540]  No, the streaming experience is terrible.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:58.500]  Well, or at least they try, they try, they try.
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.900]  But the one that blows me away
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:02.020]  is that the NFL has really embraced it.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.940]  And part of it is that I have a cable subscription still
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.300]  and I've registered through it.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.500]  But I watched an awful lot of NFL football this year
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:13.420]  on my iPad instead of on TV.
[01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.340]  And it's really good technically,
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:19.020]  but it's just amazing to me that the NFL of all networks,
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:21.380]  which is the one that is the most dominant,
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:24.660]  has the most money and is sort of therefore
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:27.920]  the least likely to embrace something new.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:30.540]  The iPad is like a first class client
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.300]  for watching live NFL games now.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:34.740]  And it's just, that just blows me away.
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:36.500]  Like in a way that your computer can't be
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:38.340]  and that you wouldn't want it, it's too small.
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.180]  You don't want to watch it on your phone.
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:40.680]  I mean, I know people do watch on their phone,
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:42.060]  but it's no good.
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:42.900]  You watch on your phone
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.860]  because it's the only way to watch it, right?
[01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:47.860]  Whereas you would voluntarily watch something on the iPad
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.900]  because you're at like a kid's birthday party
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:51.900]  and there's a game you want to watch.
[01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:53.900]  Okay, you're going to watch at your phone.
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.020]  Right, exactly.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:57.300]  But watching on your iPad is like totally credible.
[01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.660]  It is like absolutely totally credible
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.060]  and keeps up to anyway.
[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:02.340]  It's just, it is a great,
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.220]  I don't want to get too sidetracked from our complaints,
[01:57:04.220 --> 01:57:06.180]  but it is a great consumption device.
[01:57:06.180 --> 01:57:09.420]  And it's a better TV than my TV.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:10.260]  Yep.
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:11.420]  That's exactly, no, it's exactly right.
[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:13.340]  And you get, it's disruptive in a way, right?
[01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:14.540]  To take this sort of full circle
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:17.700]  because you can layer on all sorts of stuff
[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:21.480]  and things that you can't have on your TV.
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:24.480]  But the interactivity and the portability,
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.120]  but while also having this large screen
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:29.120]  that holding an iPad right in front of you
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.020]  relative to a large TV on the wall,
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:34.100]  like the actual viewing experience is actually,
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:37.300]  the difference is much smaller than you might think it is.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.780]  And the screen quality is incredible
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:40.100]  and all those sorts of things.
[01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:43.140]  But at the initial iPad launch,
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:44.860]  they'd also showed iWork.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:49.860]  And it was also kind of a mind blowing demo
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:52.540]  in that they were doing this really cool stuff
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:55.200]  with inserting stuff and moving stuff around
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:56.120]  with your fingers.
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.940]  And there was the hint of something there.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.420]  And I wrote about,
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.620]  I had a few sort of false starts as far as blogs
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:06.460]  going through the years,
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.380]  but I had like a Tumblr back in the day
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.740]  where I wrote about the iPad when it launched.
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:16.940]  And I talked about where it fit relative to the phone
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:18.060]  and relative to the computer.
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:19.060]  But at the end, I'm like,
[01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:21.820]  what's really compelling here is the,
[01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:22.980]  I focus on content consumption.
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:25.000]  I'm like, this is clearly a content consumption device.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:25.840]  That is better.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.660]  I'm gonna take one timeout.
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:28.020]  I'm just gonna tell you right now as a listener,
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.940]  I'm gonna remember this.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:32.500]  I am gonna put that graphic you're talking about.
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.700]  It's gonna be the album art as we talk right now.
[01:58:34.700 --> 01:58:35.940]  So you could just look at your phone
[01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:36.980]  and look at the album art.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.520]  You'll see the drawing Ben's talking about.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.300]  All right, keep going.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:42.940]  Well, a 10 year old drawing,
[01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:44.920]  some of which holds up better than others.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:47.340]  But you know, again, you go back and,
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:49.660]  you know, one of the things that has constricted the iPad
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:51.560]  over time is that phones now are so much larger.
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.140]  But you remember back in 2010,
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:55.400]  you're dealing with a 3.5 inch crappy screen
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:58.060]  where you really didn't want to be watching
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:58:59.140]  an NBA game on that.
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.380]  The iPad was just incredible.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:02.560]  Like it was so much larger and better.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.020]  But I put at the end,
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:05.420]  so that article is focused on it
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:06.820]  as a content consumption device.
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:09.380]  But at the end, I'm like, look, there's something else here.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:11.980]  Like what was, I mentioned that iWork demo.
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:15.340]  I'm like, you can do stuff that you just can't do
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:18.660]  on a computer because you're directly manipulating it.
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.420]  Now the implication is there's stuff you can do
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:22.700]  on a computer that you can't do on an iPad,
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.140]  but it was new.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:25.220]  It was something different and new.
[01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:27.860]  And that's where the GarageBand demo
[01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:31.020]  and the iPad 2 announcement comes in for me.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:34.840]  Like it was, like as someone who has dabbled around
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.460]  in sort of these music creation apps
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:39.020]  and I'm a piano player and stuff like that,
[01:59:39.020 --> 01:59:40.640]  it was so mind blowing.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:42.660]  That's the only time I've ever stood in line
[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:45.980]  for an Apple product.
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.740]  I had to get the iPad 2
[01:59:47.740 --> 01:59:50.280]  and I was going on a plane that night to Taiwan
[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.780]  and I downloaded GarageBand
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:54.220]  and I spent the entire 12 hour flight
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.540]  just like making songs.
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:59.420]  Like it was, it's hard, it was mind blowing.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:01.140]  It was absolutely incredible.
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.860]  The way that you could just,
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:05.420]  you could do stuff that wasn't really possible.
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:08.700]  Again, it was technically possible on a computer,
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.980]  but the user interface and experience
[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.120]  was just transformative on the iPad.
[02:00:13.120 --> 02:00:14.980]  It was absolutely incredible.
[02:00:14.980 --> 02:00:19.160]  And what was so, and you saw, and Jobs knew it, right?
[02:00:19.160 --> 02:00:23.540]  Like it's one of my all time favorite Jobs on stage moments
[02:00:23.540 --> 02:00:27.260]  is the like 15 seconds after the demo and he's on there
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:30.480]  and he's just like, he's used this.
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.220]  He was involved in the creation of it.
[02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:34.300]  He knew the demo, they'd run through it.
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.580]  And even then, he just looks astonished, right?
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:39.740]  Like he's like, I can't believe,
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:42.580]  and to me, it was a wonderful moment
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:46.420]  that I reflected on a lot when Jobs passed away
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:50.380]  later that year is I'm glad that he was able
[02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:54.180]  to have that moment as an exec,
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.980]  because it was, to my mind,
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:58.180]  the culmination of his life's work.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:00.340]  Because he comes on there and he's like,
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:01.380]  isn't it incredible?
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:03.300]  And then he says something like,
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:06.020]  he's like, now anyone can make music.
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:10.460]  And that's what, he wanted the computer for anyone,
[02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:13.180]  that anyone could unlock their creativity.
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.320]  Anyone could do this because it was so much more intuitive
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:17.620]  and so much more approachable.
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:20.580]  And direct. And fundamentally,
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.860]  it was fundamentally less powerful.
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:23.700]  Yeah.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.220]  You could not do in GarageBand,
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:28.020]  we could do Logic or we can do in GarageBand on the Mac.
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:30.860]  Because you're limited to the direct interaction,
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:34.140]  it was fundamentally less powerful,
[02:01:34.140 --> 02:01:37.140]  but it was disruptive in the best sense of the word.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.940]  It did not meet the needs of true musicians
[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:42.660]  who were wanting to make a huge sort of,
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:44.420]  make a professional song,
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:46.840]  but it meant it was way more accessible
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.140]  to way more people to actually build their own songs.
[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:55.140]  And to me, that was what was so amazing
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:58.380]  and compelling about the iPad.
[02:01:58.380 --> 02:02:01.260]  And what I feel we've never really seen
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:04.420]  the full manifestation of was this possibility
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:07.120]  of completely new kinds of applications,
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:09.620]  new kinds of computing that would open up
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.300]  the power of computers to so many more people.
[02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:15.180]  And that's why the whole discussion
[02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:20.180]  of the multitasking thing is so frustrating to me,
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:26.060]  because we're debating these power user features
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:31.340]  that are basically trying to recreate
[02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:33.060]  what we can already do on the Mac,
[02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:35.380]  but we're trading away.
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:38.780]  It's more complex and less powerful and less useful.
[02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:39.900]  And I'm over here saying,
[02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:44.140]  what about this whole world that was stillborn?
[02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:46.340]  Like where you could do something
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.460]  that you could not do on the PC?
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:50.780]  When we're talking about dealing with multiple windows,
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:52.020]  we can do that on the PC.
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.500]  It's like, would you rather do it on the PC
[02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:54.580]  or would you rather it on the computer?
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:55.740]  Would you rather stay at a Motel 6
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:57.540]  or would you rather stay at a Ritz-Carlton?
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:59.820]  Well, if we make the Motel 6,
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:01.820]  we have much nicer bedsheets,
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:04.360]  and if we have better service and we make the rooms bigger,
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.700]  and then we could have a Ritz-Carlton too.
[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:09.700]  And it's like, that's not disruptive.
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:11.260]  It's trying to do the same thing,
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.140]  but from a different perspective,
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:15.700]  I want something that's completely and utterly new,
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:19.020]  and when I look back 10 years on,
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:21.900]  it's like, where are those applications?
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:24.020]  That's what I'm interested in.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:26.700]  Right, and now we have Apple bragging
[02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:28.980]  about desktop-class Safari.
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.900]  Which is, again, which is just parody.
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:32.740]  It's just parody.
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:33.940]  Anyway, I wanna take a break.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:35.420]  I have one more sponsor to thank.
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:37.940]  But, and then we'll bring this home on iPad.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.300]  Brand new sponsor for the show.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:46.300]  It's our good friends at Feals, F-E-A-L-S.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:47.300]  What is Feals?
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:52.300]  Feals is a premium CBD delivered directly to your doorstop.
[02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:54.020]  What does Feals do?
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:56.820]  Feals naturally helps reduce stress,
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:59.060]  anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:00.100]  It'll help you sleep.
[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:02.220]  Easy to take.
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:03.060]  How do you take it?
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:07.020]  You take a few drops of Feals, drop it under your tongue,
[02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:09.840]  and you will feel the difference within minutes.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:13.640]  New to CBD, don't know what it's all about.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:18.640]  Feals offers a free CBD hotline and text message support.
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:22.480]  Personally, I'd rather text than call somebody on the phone.
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:24.200]  But whatever you want, you can do it.
[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:27.180]  And it can help you guide your personal experience.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:29.040]  You can feel better naturally with Feals.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.900]  It works naturally to help you feel better.

[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:35.840]  It's not stuff that gets you high.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:38.200]  There's no hangover, no addiction.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.480]  And it's a membership system.
[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.960]  You join the Feals community,

[02:04:58.280 --> 02:04:59.120]  It's good stuff.

[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:31.120]  My thanks to Feals for sponsoring the show.
[02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:32.600]  Give them a try.
[02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:36.760]  I really like the fact that we started with the sort of
[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:39.100]  the disruption in Christians and stuff a bit in the beginning
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:44.100]  because I think it gets at exactly why I am frustrated
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:46.640]  and disappointed in the product.
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:49.640]  It's, again, it's not to say it's not,
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:51.360]  people don't love them and it's not successful
[02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:53.720]  and Apple doesn't make a lot of money from them.
[02:05:53.720 --> 02:05:54.880]  It's that it.
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.920]  I think that's what masks the problems,
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:00.360]  that people do love them and people do use them.
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.680]  And so it's easy for somebody to defend it
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:04.400]  and say there's nothing wrong, right?
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:07.180]  It's successful and people love it.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:09.920]  But I really, it is frustrating to me.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:12.180]  And I don't think it's lived up to the potential.
[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:14.320]  And while I like the fact that they're talking,
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.880]  that they've added quote unquote desktop class Safari,
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:18.800]  like that should, 10 years in,
[02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:20.760]  that should not be a bragging point.
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.880]  Well, I mean, it's just like if the, why is it,
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:29.160]  it's sad to me that the goal is to compete with the Mac.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:30.880]  It's sad because one,
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:32.320]  like the Mac's pretty good at what it does.
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.160]  And if anything,
[02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:35.600]  I'd rather have more resources go there to make it better.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:38.680]  But two, it's sad because you're playing on the max turf.
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:41.400]  Like you're, if you want to compete
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.340]  with a multi-window environment,
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:45.640]  probably best to start with the environment
[02:06:45.640 --> 02:06:47.660]  that was built with multi-window assumptions
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:48.500]  from the beginning.
[02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:50.300]  The iPad was not built with those assumptions.
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.780]  The iPad was built with one window assumptions,
[02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:54.540]  that it's the entire, again,
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:57.960]  that it transforms the device into a music studio.
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:00.200]  It transforms the device into an easel.
[02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:05.200]  It transforms the device into a photo editing environment
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.800]  or whatever it might be.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.760]  And I think there was,
[02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:09.980]  I think there's two areas
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:12.420]  where the iPad really lost its way.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.800]  The first area, unfortunately,
[02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:17.520]  and it fits with the theme, I guess, of this podcast,
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.000]  was jobs passing away.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  Like I'm very reticent to go into what,
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:26.840]  Steve Jobs would do something different.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:30.200]  But I think the one product that misses Jobs
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:32.560]  more than any other product is the iPad.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:37.560]  Like again, to me, it really was the culmination
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.920]  of what he was pushing computing to be,
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.680]  his vision of what computing could be,
[02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:44.360]  computing for the rest of us.
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:49.360]  And when he was gone, who had that vision?
[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:53.400]  I think one of the things Steve Jobs was so good at,
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:57.160]  and his reputation is that he was so,
[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.440]  I mean, for lack of a better word, arrogant, right?
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.600]  And you couldn't tell him anything.
[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:03.340]  But the fact is, he did listen.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:05.420]  And famously, there's always a bunch of stories
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:07.120]  where someone would get in an argument with them,
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:10.560]  and Jobs would say X, and you would say Y,
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.080]  and then you'd make your case for Y,
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:13.480]  and he'd say, that's stupid.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:14.640]  And you'd come back the next day,
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:16.560]  and Jobs would say, I have a great idea.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:17.400]  Why?
[02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:19.240]  Right?
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:21.640]  And that was his way of acknowledging that you were right.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.720]  It was like, he slept on it,
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:24.360]  and he was like, yeah, you know, that is a good idea.
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.160]  And then he'd convince himself it was his idea,
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:27.640]  and then, you know, go ahead.
[02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:31.080]  But he could admit mistakes, right?
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:34.440]  And he didn't go into denial about them.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:37.420]  And so, in small ways, I do think that
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:38.480]  if Jobs were still around,
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:42.760]  I think that the MacBook keyboard fiasco
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.760]  would have ended sooner.
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:45.640]  Without question.
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:47.400]  I'm not saying they wouldn't have shipped it.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.600]  And I've always said throughout the whole thing,
[02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:51.640]  the problem isn't that they shipped that keyboard.
[02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:54.040]  The problem is, I mean, in-
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:55.200]  They shipped it for three and a half years.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:56.760]  Ideally, they wouldn't have shipped it.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:58.640]  But you make mistakes, you know what I mean?
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.080]  They shipped the MacCube, you know?
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:02.000]  And it turned out it was not the right idea.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:02.840]  You know what they did?
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:05.040]  They stopped production of the MacCube.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.840]  They didn't make the MacCube for four years
[02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:09.140]  and keep throwing good money after bad.
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:13.080]  I really do think that there are ways
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:17.960]  that Jobs' leadership and his style would have helped.
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:20.480]  But the Mac doesn't need that much help.
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:22.400]  The Mac, it knows what it is.
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:24.260]  It does what it does really well.
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.280]  And the phone has done really well post Jobs.
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.160]  And that there's people clearly at Apple
[02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:34.520]  who kind of have a really good sense of the iPhone.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:37.840]  It's clearly, you know, because it makes the most money.
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:39.360]  I mean, you can be cynical about it.
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:42.780]  It gets the highest talent within the company
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:45.960]  to pay the fullest attention to every aspect of it,
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.900]  hardware and software.
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:52.160]  And I think it's in a really good place, software-wise.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.200]  I really do think iOS 13 is in a really good place.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:56.900]  And there's things I would change.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:00.920]  You know, everybody has complaints.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.760]  But I'm with you.
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.120]  I think that the iPad is the one product where really,
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:06.480]  and at a big level, it's not like a little thing,
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:08.300]  like, oh, I don't think the buttons should be flat.
[02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.640]  I think they should have a little bit of 3D
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:10.480]  or something like that.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:11.640]  It's not a superficial thing.
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:14.400]  I think at a very profound, fundamental level.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.240]  A conceptual level.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:16.880]  Yeah, a conceptual level.
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.040]  The iPad could be so much further along,
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:21.600]  and I do think, and I'm with you.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:24.160]  I really do hate to play the,
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.880]  I think things would be X, Y, and Z different
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:28.960]  if Steve Jobs were still around.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:31.080]  But I really do feel like the iPad is the one
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.680]  where it should, and I've seen a bunch of other people,
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:35.800]  either in reaction to my piece,
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:38.760]  or just on their own on this 10th anniversary,
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:40.960]  express the same thought.
[02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:44.360]  And it's really hard to deny, I think,
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.540]  if you really, and going back like you did,
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:51.280]  and looking at that, especially not the first iPad,
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:56.280]  but that iPad 2 demo with the GarageBand thing
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:58.600]  and a couple other things that,
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:03.280]  and with a year of their own use of iPad
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:06.640]  combined with seeing how the world had taken to it
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:11.200]  under their belt, there did seem to be
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:14.960]  a certain gleam in his eye that they were onto something.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:17.480]  And then all that really happened in the intervening years
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:20.080]  is they've just made faster and faster CPUs.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.240]  I mean, the hardware got undeniably better, right?
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.720]  It went to Retina and got thinner and lighter.
[02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:28.560]  It's truly, the iPhone and the iPad
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:30.200]  are the best hardware they make.
[02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.600]  And the Mac, it's almost unfair.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.500]  The Mac is so limited by what Intel offers.
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:40.640]  The one thing that the Mac users are most jealous of
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:45.640]  is the fact that we don't have Apple's own ARM CPUs inside.
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:51.400]  But in terms of conceptual using the iPad,
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.860]  it just hasn't gone very far.
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:55.760]  Well, it's funny.
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:11:59.240]  So there's been two ways where Apple has sought
[02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:01.620]  to sort of push the iPad forward post-jobs.
[02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:09.400]  Sales kind of peaked around the iPad 2, iPad 3 era,
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:10.640]  and then they sort of started to go down
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:13.460]  and Apple's like, what can we do to make this better?
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:16.200]  The first one was coming out with the iPad Pro
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.040]  and the Pencil and the keyboard.
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:21.180]  It's interesting because I think the Pencil
[02:12:21.180 --> 02:12:23.140]  was so clearly the right thing to do.
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:25.820]  It was definitely one of those X, Y arguments
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.040]  you'd have to have with Jobs,
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:29.640]  where he would, I'm sure, have been against it,
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]  and then you would have convinced him
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.680]  that it was the right thing to do.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:36.180]  That is a, again, what is powerful about the Pencil
[02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.080]  is it's something that you can't do on the Mac.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.600]  I guess you can have a Wacom tablet
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:41.360]  or something along those sorts of lines,
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.180]  but it's still indirect manipulation,
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:45.140]  or if you even have those that show the screen on there,
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:47.900]  it's very clunky, it's not accessible to most people.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:50.280]  The iPad makes a new sort of paradigm
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.840]  and approach accessible to new people
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:54.440]  in a way that doesn't really make sense on a phone either.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.520]  It's something unique and special to iPad,
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:59.280]  and as I noted, remains my number one use case
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.680]  for an iPad is doing these drawings.
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:03.280]  I don't know if Jobs would have been opposed to it.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:05.760]  I know everybody loves to go back to that,
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:08.520]  if you see a stylus, they blew it, quote.
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:09.360]  But I.
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:10.180]  That was about the phone.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:12.520]  And it was about requiring a stylus.
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.820]  It was about a device where you needed a stylus
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.720]  to use it like the Newton and the Palm Pilot,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.060]  and there's a reason,
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:23.120]  that's not the only reason why they called it
[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.200]  the Apple Pencil and not the Apple Stylus.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:27.140]  You know, it wasn't just to avoid the word
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:30.520]  that founder Steve Jobs had used and said they blew it.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.400]  It's different, because it's absolutely not required.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.000]  It does something very different.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.080]  You can use it, and I know in the early days
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:38.560]  that a pencil was actually up in the air,
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:41.200]  whether you could even use it as a replacement
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:44.160]  for your finger for tapping buttons and stuff,
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:45.880]  or was it only for drawing.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:48.080]  And they, you know, worked that out.
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.280]  It's totally a plus.
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.280]  It just enables an entirely new level of stuff on your iPad.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:56.420]  It's not something you need.
[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:58.400]  So I don't know that Jobs would have been opposed to it.
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:13:59.980]  What you said is super important too.
[02:13:59.980 --> 02:14:03.760]  It's a plus in a way that enhances the experience
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:04.980]  without detracting from it.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:07.200]  In a way, multitasking is a plus,
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:11.680]  but it imposes such a level of overhead and complexity
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:14.560]  that for someone like your mom, or me personally,
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:17.080]  it's a minus, you know, exactly, right?
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:21.240]  And so that's an addition that makes sense
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.880]  when it's purely additive, like the Pencil is.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.520]  But anyhow, so Apple pushes forward the hardware.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.320]  And obviously the hardware today is an amazing state.
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:30.520]  Like the iPad Pro today is, I think,
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.960]  the most beautiful piece of hardware that Apple makes.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:35.940]  It rivals the iPhone 4 for arguably the best piece
[02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:38.000]  of hardware Apple has ever made,
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.920]  as far as just sort of like being a jewel
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:43.200]  and just this incredible sort of thing.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.860]  So that was number one.
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:47.200]  And then number two has been this recent push
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.960]  to add the iPad OS and add this multitasking
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:52.120]  and this complexity.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.340]  And what's interesting about both of those efforts
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:57.480]  is those are both things that are under Apple's,
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:59.040]  what does Apple control on the iPad?
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.560]  They control the hardware and they control the OS.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.440]  And where have they focused their efforts
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:06.440]  on sort of making the iPad interesting to end users?
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.040]  It's by iterating on the hardware and iterating on the OS.
[02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:12.840]  And there's a big missing piece here,
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.760]  which is the apps themselves, the developers.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:19.160]  And this is, to my mind, the fundamental failing
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:20.600]  of the iPad.
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.320]  Like at the end of the day, Steve Jobs is one person.
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:27.080]  Like you can't have, no matter how great he is,
[02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:29.840]  Steve Jobs is not gonna conceptualize
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:32.640]  every possible use case that an iPad could be used for.
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:35.280]  Like this idea that an iPad can become anything,
[02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:37.520]  by definition, that's where you need
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:40.120]  the third-party developers to come up
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:45.120]  with completely new programs and applications for an iPad
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:48.160]  that transform it into something different
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.440]  that Apple would have never thought of,
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:50.760]  that Steve Jobs would have never thought of.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:53.100]  Like this is the whole power of markets
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:56.240]  where people create something completely new
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:59.040]  to meet a need that no sort of central authority
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:00.440]  would have thought of on their own.
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:03.760]  But it's possible to come forward and to,
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.600]  why do they do it?
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:06.300]  Because they can, one, it's possible,
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:07.720]  and two, they can make money doing it.
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:09.440]  And that's the missing piece.
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:10.800]  You can't make money.
[02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:15.800]  And like the iPad is meant to be some sort of like,
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:18.520]  productivity where you can do stuff on it.
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:20.800]  That's what makes the large canvas approachable
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.700]  in a way the iPhone sort of isn't.
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:25.200]  But to do that, you need to be able to sell.
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:26.680]  And you need to be able to sell to people.
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.880]  And the people that fall in love with your application
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.720]  and it's really good.
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:30.540]  Oh, can you add this feature?
[02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:31.560]  Can you add this feature?
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:32.920]  Well, you can add the features
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:34.620]  and you can charge them again.
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:35.460]  Guess what?
[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:38.160]  That's what happened on the Mac.
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:41.880]  You had developers creating all sorts of applications,
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.840]  creating entire industries, which you mentioned in your piece
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:47.360]  especially like the graphic design and layout
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:48.980]  and all those sorts of things.
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:51.120]  You had all these sort of small developers
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.520]  making all these little utilities on the Mac.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:55.560]  And why did it work?
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.380]  Because you didn't have to go out and sell it one time
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:00.720]  for 99 cents and try to get a bunch of users.
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:02.740]  You could find your core users,
[02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:06.320]  your thousand true fans or whatever, you could charge them.
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.520]  Then you could work for a year.
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:09.640]  You come back, you could charge the same users again.
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:11.080]  And they were happy to pay you
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.480]  because they loved your application.
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:13.640]  It was very useful for them.
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:14.560]  You could do more.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:16.740]  All that aspect is missing
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:19.440]  because of the App Store's limitations.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.600]  And the reason why I think the iPad
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:23.880]  never reaches potential,
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:27.280]  we never got these sort of transformative use cases
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.240]  that were not recreating the Mac,
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:34.640]  but were creating something entirely new and powerful
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:36.280]  is because there was no money in it.
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.200]  And you couldn't, like to create something like GarageBand
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.320]  requires a huge amount of resources.
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.240]  It means making a big bet.
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:45.280]  Because to building software,
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:48.460]  you have to spend all the time and money upfront
[02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:50.520]  creating that and you have to put out there for sale
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:52.640]  and hope people come along and tell their friends
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:54.180]  and then we'll buy an upgrade.
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:57.040]  Like who, why would you make that bet
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.280]  if you're in an App Store environment?
[02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:01.520]  There's no business model to justify it,
[02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:03.980]  which meant those applications never got made.
[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:08.980]  And this is Apple's sort of tragic weakness.
[02:18:09.340 --> 02:18:12.320]  They want to control everything.
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:16.080]  And that control meant they tried to use that control
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:17.400]  to make the iPad better.
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:18.360]  What can we control?
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.400]  We can control the hardware.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:21.180]  Great, we'll make the hardware much better.
[02:18:21.180 --> 02:18:22.080]  What can we control?
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:22.900]  We control the OS.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:25.320]  Great, we'll take the OS and we'll add a bunch of stuff
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:27.360]  that maybe that's what people will like.
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:31.440]  What Apple actually needed to make the iPad successful
[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:34.400]  was to loosen control, was to give more freedom,
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:37.800]  more possibilities so that developers could make
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.760]  these transformative experiences that took the potential
[02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.760]  of a device that could change into anything
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.000]  you wanted it to be and to fully realize that.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.720]  You mentioned, I forget what year you took the numbers from
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:54.920]  but there was a point and it's firsthand
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:57.000]  but to me it's the one where the Mac was clearly
[02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.220]  the strongest was the desktop publishing industry.
[02:18:59.220 --> 02:19:01.880]  And there were other areas where the Mac did
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.380]  and has continued to thrive, education in some ways
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:09.220]  but desktop publishing for me is near and dear my heart
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:11.720]  and it truly transformed the industry
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:13.040]  as a 10 year old product.
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.400]  And again, it's exactly how old the iPad is.
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:18.920]  The graphic design industry, whether you're like
[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.120]  an illustrator or doing page layout in Quark
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:26.600]  or page maker at the time or whatever,
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.680]  all the various things you could do in Photoshop.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:33.680]  Nobody who was a professional illustrator or photographer
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:38.040]  or layout artist was using computers in 1984.
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:41.880]  I mean, I shouldn't say nobody but it was obscure
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:43.680]  and you were using these text-based things
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:48.680]  and nobody really, computers just weren't part of it.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.600]  And by 1994, nobody was not using a computer.
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:55.760]  In 10 years, everything was computerized.
[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:58.520]  Everything, all page layout, every newspaper,
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:00.920]  every magazine, every advertisement,
[02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:02.640]  everything that was going to print
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:06.540]  went through computer software and it was either on the Mac
[02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:09.920]  or it was Windows versions of apps on the Mac
[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:11.860]  but probably it was through the Mac.
[02:20:12.920 --> 02:20:15.320]  I remember when I was doing print stuff in the 90s,
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:19.360]  you used to have to pay more if it was Windows formatted
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:21.220]  stuff sometimes than if it was Mac
[02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:24.400]  because the print shops anticipated so many problems
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.040]  with color separation and stuff like that.
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:28.960]  They literally charged more
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:32.320]  because it was so fundamentally Mac-based.
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:33.960]  What are the industries like that
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:35.680]  that have been transformed by the iPad?
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:38.400]  And there are some, I mean, it's like somebody pointed out
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:41.240]  that iPads are huge with pilots.
[02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:42.080]  I get it.
[02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:46.480]  I mean, so saying that there's none is an overstatement.
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:48.600]  There are apps like Procreate
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:51.680]  that are really, really great on the iPad
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.200]  and I think the pencil drives a lot of that with Procreate
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:59.600]  and it's great in a way that you just couldn't really do
[02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:01.920]  what Procreate does on the Mac.
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.080]  It really needs that direct manipulation
[02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:08.760]  but there's just nowhere near as much of it
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:10.260]  as there could be.
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:12.120]  Well, just look at the companies.
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:18.940]  In 1984, Adobe did not exist.
[02:21:18.940 --> 02:21:21.600]  In 1994, it did and it was worth a billion dollars.
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:24.000]  And Apple was only worth two billion at the time.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.760]  Exactly, and if you go back through the entire history,
[02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:33.760]  I think that's a reason why Apple has been so unfriendly,
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.580]  relatively speaking, to developers.
[02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:37.840]  They don't want another Adobe
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:41.920]  because Adobe famously would not support OS X
[02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:46.840]  and I think Apple never wanted to be positioned
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:49.000]  where they were dependent on Microsoft and Adobe
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.840]  and so what happened though in the long run
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:53.940]  is Microsoft and Adobe are the only companies
[02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:57.460]  making these super complex applications for the iPad
[02:21:57.460 --> 02:22:01.520]  because they have larger business models that justify it
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:03.320]  and no, but that's the whole point.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:05.240]  The graphic design revolution,
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:09.000]  which you cannot overstate, that graphic design
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.320]  and desktop publishing, that's what kept the Mac alive.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:15.600]  The only reason Apple is around
[02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:17.480]  and the only reason we have iPhones and iPads
[02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:18.480]  and all this stuff to talk about
[02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:21.740]  is because when Apple was at its lowest point,
[02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:23.240]  people who were in desktop publishing
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:25.120]  were still buying Macs, right?
[02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:28.240]  That's how dominant it was and that was not,
[02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:30.760]  they were not buying it because of MacPaint, right?
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:33.960]  MacPaint was a demonstration of what was possible
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:36.040]  and then you had companies like Aldus come along
[02:22:36.040 --> 02:22:38.440]  with PageMaker or Quark, with QuarkXPress,
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:41.680]  you and I both cut our teeth on QuarkXPress
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:44.460]  and Adobe with first Illustrator and then Photoshop
[02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.720]  and then the Acrobat PDF and then they came along with,
[02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:51.080]  due to compete, what's their QuarkXPress competitor?
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.160]  InDesign.
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:22:56.120]  Yeah, InDesign and basically built their company on the Mac
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:59.880]  and third party developers are what made the Mac
[02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:01.760]  transformative and powerful and why?
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:04.000]  Because it was open, you could go on there
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.980]  and you could charge what you wanted to charge,
[02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:07.360]  you could charge it when you wanted to charge,
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.480]  you could charge for upgrades,
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.480]  Apple didn't have any control over that
[02:23:10.480 --> 02:23:13.000]  and that made it entirely possible
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  and again, everything's a trade-off.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.920]  This is a tie-in to our encryption talk before.
[02:23:16.920 --> 02:23:19.460]  There are huge benefits to the App Store,
[02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:21.960]  to security, to customers feeling safe with it,
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.820]  being willing to buy applications.
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.520]  This isn't to deny any of that
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:28.600]  but there has been a tremendous loss
[02:23:28.600 --> 02:23:32.920]  in business model flexibility that, in my estimation,
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:34.960]  is the biggest reason why the iPad
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.400]  has not reached its potential.
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.200]  It's not to say the iPad is not valuable as it is, it is,
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:44.200]  but it is so much closer to what it launched as V1.
[02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:47.880]  We're so much closer to the iPad 1 keynote
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:49.680]  and it feels like we're farther away than ever
[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:52.440]  from the iPad 2 keynote and that's what makes me sad.
[02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:57.120]  That's why I call it tragic, it's not that it's a failure,
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:23:59.880]  it's that there was the possibility
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:01.700]  of something completely new and I just feel
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:04.240]  we never really reached that potential.
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.480]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:09.280]  We took very different, and I have more to say
[02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:12.880]  but more to write and hopefully I'll get around to it soon
[02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:14.120]  but in the weeks to come.
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:16.320]  And I focused on specific details,
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:19.320]  user interface gripes and your complaint
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:21.520]  is much more big picture but fundamentally,
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:25.920]  it's two different angles on the same thing
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:30.640]  which is that it hasn't yet lived up to its potential.
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:35.640]  And it could still but would require leadership at Apple
[02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:43.640]  to acknowledge that it hasn't lived up to its potential
[02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:46.860]  and I seriously question whether that's there.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:51.860]  I really do feel that there's, I can't help but think that,
[02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:56.160]  and to me, iPad OS 13 is the evidence of it,
[02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:58.640]  that this is the one they decided to give the new name to
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:03.580]  and say it's its own S and its own OS, it has its own name
[02:25:03.580 --> 02:25:06.960]  and didn't really backtrack from any of this
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:10.240]  and hasn't really, and the other thing we can mention
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:12.720]  on this and I feel like it's held the iPad back
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:17.720]  more than the phone is the 30% slash 15% tax
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:22.720]  whatever you want, well not tax, it's not a tax,
[02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.880]  but the revenue that Apple wants to insist it gets
[02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:30.360]  through App Store purchases for anything
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:33.200]  and everything that goes through an app.
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:35.760]  And I can't help but think that that's hurt
[02:25:35.760 --> 02:25:38.820]  and it gets to your issue of insisting on control
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:42.860]  as opposed to just letting third party developers
[02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:45.800]  have more freedom on the platform.
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:48.520]  Well, that's absolutely part of it,
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:51.380]  but also there's an aspect of the more specialized
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:54.520]  and niche an app by definition, the smaller your audience
[02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:57.520]  and the way the App Store has worked is it's always,
[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.120]  if you want to make money, you need to sort of have access
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.920]  to the largest audience possible.
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.720]  And whereas if you wanna make, if you have a niche app,
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.740]  you wanna make more money from fewer people, right?
[02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:11.000]  Like this is my business model, right?
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.740]  I'm not trying to sell trajectory to a million people.
[02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:17.160]  What I wanna do is sell it to a much smaller number
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:19.400]  of people, but they pay me money continuously.
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:20.560]  So I get a lot of money out of them, right?
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:24.500]  My average revenue per customer is very high.
[02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.920]  That's very hard to do with an application
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:29.640]  because the way it worked on the Mac previously
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:33.040]  was you would sell an application for say $50.
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:36.560]  Then a year later, you have an update to the application
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:39.140]  and you can maybe sell, well, you have upgrade pricing.
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:41.440]  So if you're an existing user, you can buy it for $35
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:43.120]  or you can use your buy for $50.
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.200]  And what this lets you do is you're getting like $50
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:48.560]  or $30, wherever it might be per customer per year,
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.080]  year over year over year,
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:52.520]  that justifies this ongoing sort of investment.
[02:26:52.520 --> 02:26:54.200]  Now, things are a little better now
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:55.960]  because you can do subscription pricing,
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:59.640]  but the problem is that is so sort of consumer hostile
[02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.320]  in a way, like you have to pay
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:03.080]  or you're gonna lose access to your application.
[02:27:03.080 --> 02:27:06.580]  There's no, like that, we see this again and again,
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:09.960]  where apps developers switch to this model
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:12.520]  because it's the only way they can survive, right?
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:16.120]  You can't make money always selling to new users.
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:17.540]  It's impossible.
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:19.400]  You have to be able to make money
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:22.040]  from your existing users on an ongoing basis.
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:22.880]  The only way Apple has to do that
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:24.260]  is through subscription pricing,
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:27.200]  which is an awkward fit for productivity apps anyway.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:30.640]  And then there's this gut wrenching transition
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.300]  where everyone accuses you of being a bad person
[02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:37.380]  because you're now charging a subscription
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:38.220]  instead of just selling that,
[02:27:38.220 --> 02:27:39.880]  letting them own it and et cetera, et cetera.
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.820]  The problem that you can't do otherwise
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:45.000]  is Apple never gave them the tools to do it otherwise.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.060]  And it's a shame, like who in their right mind
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:50.720]  is gonna start a company today
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.640]  that is focused on building complex, new to the world,
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:56.920]  transformative iPad applications?
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.880]  Like there's no one that's going to do it.
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:00.400]  The only one that's gonna do it is Apple
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:01.720]  and Apple doesn't have anyone
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:03.640]  that seems to have the vision to do it in any way.
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:05.860]  To have one company making everything
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:08.580]  is not a viable outcome anyways.
[02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:10.840]  Like they should be making a platform.
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:14.200]  I mean, the tragedy, this is the tragedy that I was,
[02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:17.080]  I wrote about this back when the iPad Pencil came out.
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:18.800]  The real tragedy of the iPad
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:23.800]  is it would be such a better product if Microsoft owned it
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:26.320]  because Microsoft understands
[02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.560]  how to build a third-party platform
[02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:30.720]  and to make it possible.
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:34.040]  The problem is that you earn the right to be a platform
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:36.080]  by building a great product.
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:38.120]  And Microsoft's not building great products.
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:39.800]  Microsoft got the Windows platform
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:44.240]  by leveraging IBM basically to get computers everywhere.
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:46.840]  And then they already had the platform,
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:48.800]  then they could be a good platform provider, right?
[02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:50.280]  The way it works in the consumer market
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:52.880]  is you have to sell something that's compelling by itself
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:54.880]  where users want it and buy it.
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:56.840]  And then once you have the install base,
[02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:59.880]  now you're a platform and that's not Microsoft,
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:00.960]  that's not what Microsoft is good at.
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:04.200]  They're not good at building super friendly user,
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:06.300]  consumer products that people just want to buy
[02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:07.360]  in their own right.
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:08.840]  And so you have this weird situation
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:10.280]  where in an ideal world,
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:13.540]  we could have Apple create these new concepts,
[02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:15.760]  these new ideas, these new products like an iPad,
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:18.200]  and then they could hand it off to Microsoft to manage.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.480]  And then we could have a flowering developer ecosystem
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:24.580]  on top of it that help it reach its full potential.
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:27.000]  But unfortunately the world doesn't work that way.
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.960]  Hey, what app do you, I wanted to ask you this,
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:31.920]  what app do you use for making your drawings
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.360]  for Stratechery on the iPad?
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.720]  So the app I used for many years was Paper
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:38.360]  by kind of called 53.
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:41.000]  Paper, since they were acquired,
[02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.560]  I think they're still around, but they basically failed.
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:45.640]  They only ever made money by selling a stylus
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:46.660]  and then the Apple Pencil came out,
[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:48.520]  which made their application way better
[02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.400]  and also destroyed their ability to make money.
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:55.440]  Again, because I would have paid for upgrades
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:56.960]  continually to that application,
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:30:00.680]  but they charged me once like $10 and I used it for years
[02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:03.640]  and made a ton of money using the application
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:05.100]  and they got none of that.
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:08.800]  So I increasingly use Linnea now from the folks
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:09.680]  at Icon Factory.
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:13.000]  So I still use Paper for a couple of things.
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.520]  There's a few things that it, a few effects it has,
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:19.880]  but that I like, but more and more I use Linnea.
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:22.560]  It just, it's really cool.
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:25.840]  It's got some more power as far as layering goes
[02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:26.840]  and stuff like that.
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:30.960]  Whereas Paper is more of a pure drawing app,
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:33.120]  but yeah, those are the two applications that I use.
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:34.640]  Yeah, I love Linnea.
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:35.920]  I call it Linnea.
[02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:36.920]  I don't know how to pronounce it.
[02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:40.520]  I should ask our friend Hockenberry.
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:42.260]  I'm gonna guess that I'm wrong.
[02:30:43.520 --> 02:30:45.160]  You could always, you could make a ton of money
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:47.620]  betting that on any pronunciation thing,
[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:48.560]  my guess is wrong.
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:52.720]  Linnea, Linnea sounds prettier and they do graphic,
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:54.800]  so I'm gonna guess it actually is Linnea,
[02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:56.320]  but I've, in my head, I've always-
[02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:57.320]  It's like line-ay.
[02:30:58.760 --> 02:30:59.600]  I've said Linnea.
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:01.920]  That's my go-to drawing app.
[02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:02.920]  I don't do a lot of drawings,
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.880]  but when I do, that's what I use.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:05.800]  I love it.
[02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.520]  And one of the things I love about it,
[02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:10.440]  and it's just from one small indie developer.
[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:11.480]  It's like a $10 app.
[02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:13.180]  I think they're moving to a subscription prompt,
[02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:16.360]  but it has things like layers.
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:18.560]  It has, you know, which are concepts that are common
[02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:21.940]  in every Mac drawing photo editing app,
[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:26.200]  but Linnea doesn't look like a Mac app at all.
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:28.520]  It is so iPad.
[02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:29.480]  It also doesn't look,
[02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:31.920]  and I know they have like a little iPhone version,
[02:31:31.920 --> 02:31:34.280]  you know, where you can finger paint,
[02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:37.080]  but the iPad version is like the one true version,
[02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:40.240]  and it is iPad-y in a way.
[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:47.360]  Your iPad becomes an easel.
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:52.100]  Like, the best iPad apps change the nature
[02:31:52.100 --> 02:31:55.120]  of what this device in your hand is, right?
[02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:58.920]  My iPad with an NBA game on it is a TV.
[02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.280]  My iPad with Linnea on it is an easel.
[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:03.440]  My iPad with GarageBand on it is a piano,
[02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:04.640]  like, to your point.
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:09.640]  And that is the magic of the iPad.
[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:13.480]  And there's no magic in multitasking, sorry, right?
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:18.480]  Like, it's the, like, this whole concept
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:23.520]  of putting the iPad against a Mac or against a PC,
[02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:25.580]  it's like you're putting in a situation
[02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:27.120]  where it's going to lose.
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:29.080]  Like, yes, some people will power,
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:33.040]  like, you have to be more of a power user
[02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:36.520]  to use an iPad for multitasking than you do a PC,
[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:38.360]  which doesn't make any,
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:40.520]  it just conceptually doesn't make any sense.
[02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:41.360]  Right.
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:44.400]  And, like, the wrong trade-offs were made.
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:47.960]  Like, the trade-off should be that an iPad
[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.560]  is impossibly easy to use.
[02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.600]  When your mom's doing mail, she's in her mail app.
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:53.400]  When she's browsing the web, she's on the web.
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:57.520]  Like, it transforms, there's no of this mixing of metaphors
[02:32:57.520 --> 02:32:59.320]  and mixing of ideas together.
[02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:01.040]  It is what it is.
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:04.520]  And if you feel frustrated by that and limited by that,
[02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:05.720]  then you should go get a Mac.
[02:33:05.720 --> 02:33:09.980]  Like, this idea that we should lose the simplicity
[02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:12.720]  to have an inferior version of the Mac
[02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:14.320]  is just wrong to me.
[02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:15.960]  I think you made this point in your article,
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:17.980]  like, less powerful and more complex
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:20.160]  or something along those lines.
[02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:22.320]  That's the surest sign that the wrong trade-offs were made.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:25.640]  Well, and if it were going to be, you know,
[02:33:25.640 --> 02:33:27.160]  maybe it should be off by default.
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:29.200]  You know, like, your point that the multitask,
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.200]  you know, that you want to argue
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:32.720]  that the split-screen multitasking was all a mistake
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:36.200]  or whatever, and for the people who really do love it,
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:38.840]  maybe it should be there as an option,
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:40.960]  but maybe it should be off by default.
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:44.440]  But I firmly stand by what you just said,
[02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:47.440]  that it is a power user feature.
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:50.040]  Whereas on the Mac, because that's what the Mac
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.600]  was designed for ground up, people, common people,
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.160]  don't even think about the fact that you can see
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.720]  two or three apps at a time on your Mac.
[02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:00.920]  It doesn't even seem like a thing that you've done
[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:02.600]  or did anything for.
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.120]  And I'm not saying everyone should get a Mac.
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:07.020]  Like, that's the thing.
[02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:09.640]  I actually think the iPad should be the computer
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.280]  for the rest of us, right?
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:12.120]  As it were.
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:16.440]  Like, you can do everything you want to do on an iPad
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:18.280]  as on a Mac.
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:21.280]  Like, if you want to have multiple windows,
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:25.080]  like, you don't need two windows to do something.
[02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:26.760]  You could switch back and forth.
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.040]  The reason you have two windows is because
[02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:31.600]  it's more convenient and easier to do, right?
[02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.280]  But that's fine.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:36.280]  It's okay to have something more complex
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.080]  for more powerful and more complex things.
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:40.320]  So, one of the things I want to bring up,
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.040]  and hopefully I'd be able, I haven't looked,
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:45.760]  because I only thought of it while you and I
[02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:47.440]  are talking right here, but hopefully I can
[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:48.980]  maybe get some videos of it.
[02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:50.360]  I don't know how I'll find them,
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:51.500]  or at least some screenshots.
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:53.960]  But do you remember Tweety for iPad
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.740]  when Lauren Brikter was doing Tweety
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:58.920]  before it was acquired by Twitter
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.900]  and became the official Twitter for iOS app?
[02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:06.600]  Tweety, do you remember Tweety for iPad?
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:11.600]  It was wholly original and separate from Tweety for iPhone
[02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:19.140]  and had what I consider for a productivity type app,
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:23.000]  where it's like, you know, as much as Twitter
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.160]  can count as productivity, but you're reading
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:27.880]  and it's text, and there's a list of things,
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:30.320]  and you tap from a list to go into the, you know.
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:35.840]  It had a design that was so different,
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:40.840]  and it never would have worked on the Mac.
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.840]  Whereas if you look at mail for iPad from Apple,
[02:35:46.260 --> 02:35:50.880]  it is fundamentally architected visually
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:53.440]  like mail on the Mac.
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:56.920]  It's just that you tap things instead of click on them,
[02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:59.400]  and some things slide over,
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:01.120]  as opposed to all staying on screen
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:02.740]  because it's a slightly smaller screen.
[02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:06.240]  But Tweety for iPad was so different,
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:09.580]  and was so wholly for the iPad.
[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:12.600]  But also, in addition to not just aping
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:15.600]  the way a Mac Twitter client would, could,
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:19.140]  and should be designed, it also wasn't just
[02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:23.840]  the iPhone version, okay, but now it's on a 10-inch screen.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.840]  And more, more, the iPad to me is so large
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.880]  at the application level, so caught between
[02:36:31.880 --> 02:36:36.880]  those two things, mostly being just a big iPhone,
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:40.520]  but then when it's not, it's just a touchscreen Mac
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:43.200]  type thing, as opposed to being something
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.040]  wholly unique to it, right?
[02:36:45.040 --> 02:36:48.600]  Like, that's the potential that to me hasn't been tapped,
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.520]  are use cases where it could only be on an iPad.
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:54.680]  Couldn't be done on the phone,
[02:36:54.680 --> 02:36:56.240]  because the phone is too small.
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:57.400]  Couldn't be done on the Mac,
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:01.680]  because the Mac interface is, touch aside,
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:04.880]  just isn't conducive to this sort of direct manipulation
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:06.520]  of holding a tablet in your hand.
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:08.280]  I completely agree.
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.800]  And Tweety is the one that's a heartbreak.
[02:37:10.800 --> 02:37:13.320]  And then you look at like the stupid Twitter app
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:15.800]  for iPad now, and it, it, it,
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:16.640]  It's a big iPhone app.
[02:37:16.640 --> 02:37:20.040]  It could not be more, it could not be more
[02:37:20.040 --> 02:37:21.800]  just a big iPhone app.
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.720]  It is the canonical, just take what we did for the iPhone
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:28.160]  and blow it up to the size of,
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.400]  whatever the size of your iPad is.
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.680]  But again, in Twitter's defense,
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:33.000]  like why would you do anything different?
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.040]  Is it like, it's not worth, it's not worth the effort.
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:38.400]  And...
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:39.440]  Pride?
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:41.320]  Pride in your work?
[02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:42.160]  Yeah.
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:44.520]  Well, it's, and this is why,
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.560]  the fact that Twitter is,
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:47.960]  the fact that Twitter as a company
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:50.120]  has like a thousand engineers.
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:51.640]  Yeah, it's, it's amazing.
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:53.080]  Like they have 4,000 employees.
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:53.920]  I hear you.
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:55.280]  I'm not telling you that you're wrong.
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.400]  I get the argument of why would we do that?
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  But, you know.
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.960]  Fair points, fair points.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.800]  But just to go back to our,
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:04.840]  the thing we started on with the iPad discussion
[02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:05.880]  about like sort of the critics
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:08.160]  and people complaining about these articles.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:12.280]  I feel like, and again, I am,
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:14.760]  I am even more so than you,
[02:38:14.760 --> 02:38:17.360]  I am a massive critic of what the iPad has become.
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:18.200]  I think it just,
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.760]  I think the whole multitasking approach is a mistake.
[02:38:20.760 --> 02:38:24.320]  I think that the one app on the screen at a time
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:25.880]  is the right way to go.
[02:38:25.880 --> 02:38:27.720]  And I get a lot of people disagree with that.
[02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:31.520]  But what I hope is clear is,
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:33.560]  in some respects,
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:36.600]  this is like the jilted lover sort of view of it.
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:37.760]  Like I,
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:41.400]  I am so disappointed in the iPad as it is
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:44.520]  because I wanted and thought there could have been
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:46.080]  something transformative.
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:48.360]  Not the Mac done differently,
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:50.240]  but actually something that was,
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:54.760]  unlocked possibilities and ways of computing
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:56.600]  that were never possible previously.
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:59.400]  And we have, there's shadows of that.
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.480]  Like there's bits and pieces of that.
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:03.720]  And interestingly, one of the areas of the music industry
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  where there has actually been a lot of,
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:10.040]  a lot of innovation.
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.600]  And there's a whole like way to communicate between apps
[02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.040]  that was developed for music apps
[02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:16.560]  that was sort of skirted around Apple's limitations
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:18.920]  between connecting data and stuff back in the day.
[02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:21.920]  Like, and perhaps seeded because of what Apple did.
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:26.840]  But I just feel like we never ever got to what it could be.
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:29.680]  And I see no, I just don't see it happening
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:33.440]  because, again, when the iPad first came out,
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:34.760]  everyone wanted to build for it.
[02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.080]  They wanted to develop for it.
[02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:39.080]  But now who's gonna be, who's gonna take that risk?
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:41.880]  And it's not our fault, you and me,
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:43.080]  Ben Thompson and John Gruber.
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:46.120]  It's not our fault that we can't come up with specific
[02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:53.120]  ideas for what the iPad could be in 2020.
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:55.400]  That's not our job.
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:58.860]  We're simply observing that they're not there, right?
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:03.040]  Like in 1984, it wasn't clear at all
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:08.040]  what Photoshop could be in 1994 or QuarkXPress,
[02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.060]  which is truly phenomenal.
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.500]  Or the way that, like you said,
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.340]  that the desktop publishing industry
[02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:22.840]  largely kept Apple afloat because they still bought
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.240]  high-end Mac hardware throughout the whole thing
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:31.000]  because they had these workflows where catalogs
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:35.080]  were entirely set up in FileMaker databases
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:36.600]  for the catalog items.
[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:40.800]  And when you were ready to print a new 64-page catalog,
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.480]  you just hit one button, walked away for a minute or two,
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:46.480]  and then there was a QuarkXPress document
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.640]  with 64 pages completely laid out with the photos
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.640]  and the items and everything and ready to be proofread.
[02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:54.880]  Yeah, AppleScript as an underrated factor
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:56.520]  in Apple not going out of business.
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:00.380]  Yeah, combined with FileMaker and a database
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:05.380]  that was completely visual as opposed to abstract SQL tables
[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:09.600]  which have their place, but the fact that
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.780]  totally normal people could just like open the database
[02:41:12.780 --> 02:41:17.380]  and look at it and drag pictures in and stuff like that.
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:20.680]  And that you'd have these workflows
[02:41:20.680 --> 02:41:23.080]  where what used to be days of work
[02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:25.960]  was now like a minute of letting an AppleScript
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:28.640]  do its thing communicating between FileMaker.
[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:30.600]  You couldn't imagine it in 1984,
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.420]  but the foundation was there.
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.520]  You could go backwards from 1984 or from 1994
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:42.000]  and see how the fundamental ideas
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:45.020]  that the Mac was born with in 1984 led to this.
[02:41:45.020 --> 02:41:47.160]  You could go backwards and see it.
[02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:50.980]  And you could see that potential with the iPad 10 years ago
[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:55.360]  and it just hasn't gotten there.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:56.720]  And I think it could.
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:41:58.800]  I think it could, five years from now
[02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:00.480]  we could have you on the show
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:04.880]  and maybe there's a renaissance in the iPad.
[02:42:04.880 --> 02:42:06.120]  I don't think so.
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.520]  But I don't think so either.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:12.560]  To me, the missing piece was the business model piece.
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:15.440]  And the problem is even if Apple suddenly came out
[02:42:15.440 --> 02:42:20.120]  with upgrade pricing and all those sorts of things
[02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:23.840]  like the trials, like the trials you do today,
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:27.640]  they have to either unlock an in-app purchase
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:29.560]  or else this subscription thing.
[02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:31.880]  There's no like, you can't just have a full featured app
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:35.160]  with a seven-day trial, like that one click,
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:39.460]  like which we had on Windows 8 like 10 years ago.
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:42.320]  Even if that all came tomorrow,
[02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:47.240]  I think that developers are so burned by the iPad.
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:50.640]  And people will bring up applications that are on the iPad
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.520]  that are complex and whatever.
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:55.000]  And I think it would be very interesting
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.520]  to think about those complex applications
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:43:01.760]  and see if they ever actually made any money
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:04.200]  or if they were just massive, massive losses.
[02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:06.120]  Let's just put it this way.
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:08.040]  I don't think that any developer
[02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:10.080]  that has experimented with the iPad previously
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:11.660]  is gonna ever go back to the iPad.
[02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:14.620]  And that's a business model problem, not a device problem.
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:17.960]  And yeah, it's a shame.
[02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:18.880]  It's too bad.
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:20.600]  Yeah, another way to put it
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:23.320]  is you just don't see that many iPad-only apps,
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:25.200]  apps that could only be on the iPad,
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:26.560]  don't make sense on the phone
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.120]  because the screen's not big enough,
[02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:29.280]  don't make sense on the Mac
[02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:33.600]  because the interface isn't appropriate.
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:35.840]  In a way that, you know, back in the day,
[02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:38.040]  there'd be Mac apps that never would make sense
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:40.140]  on the Apple II because it just doesn't make sense
[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:41.680]  without everything that the Mac had.
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:45.000]  The iPad offers so much that the Mac doesn't
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.520]  by its innate nature that there could be apps like that
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:50.560]  and you just don't see that many of them.
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:53.140]  All right, anyway.
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:59.200]  Let's end on an upbeat note like that.
[02:44:00.360 --> 02:44:02.240]  Ben, it's always a pleasure to have you on the show.
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:03.080]  How about this?
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:04.400]  How about a Super Bowl pick?
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:08.580]  I am cheering for Kansas City
[02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:11.520]  because I want Andy Reid to win one
[02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:12.960]  and I hate the 49ers.
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.960]  So, but I have not watched football closely enough
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:20.240]  to know who to pick.
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:21.720]  All right, I'm going to go the same way.
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:23.960]  I'm gonna go with the Kansas City
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:26.160]  because I want Andy Reid to win one,
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.680]  because I find Patrick Mahomes
[02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:30.400]  to be just an absolutely appealing person.
[02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:32.660]  I have no skin in the game
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:35.080]  with or with, you know, for or against Kansas City,
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:37.160]  but I do like Andy Reid.
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:38.980]  I would like to see him win one.
[02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:40.200]  I do like Patrick Mahomes
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:43.360]  and I do hate the San Francisco 49ers.
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:48.360]  How do you get a Cowboys fan and a Packers fan united?
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:49.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:50.080]  Ask them about the 49ers.
[02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:50.920]  That's what we should do.
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:51.740]  We should open up.
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:53.600]  We should have like a bunch of pop-up bars around.
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:55.840]  You and I should quick get this together.
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:58.600]  Raise a couple, raise $100,000
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:02.760]  and open up a bunch of Packers slash Cowboys pop-up bars
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:04.820]  around the nation for Super Bowl Sunday.
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:08.600]  One week at least is...
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:12.480]  It's funny because I think maybe this is our age too,
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:13.960]  particularly because in the 90s,
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:18.960]  like these three teams had so many sort of playoff...
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:21.880]  Epic games and big matches.
[02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:22.700]  That's right.
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:26.260]  If the Cowboys were in the Super Bowl,
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:28.040]  I'd be sitting here with a 49ers fan saying,
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:30.320]  hey, as long as it's not the Cowboys,
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:31.720]  we're now on the same team.
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:33.720]  And you probably feel the same way if it was the Packers.
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:38.720]  So it's like a triangle of hate.
[02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:39.640]  Yeah.
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:42.760]  That's my pick as well.
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:45.040]  All right, everybody, of course,
[02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:46.380]  you've been on the show enough, they know it,
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:50.360]  but Stratechary, S-T-R-A-C-H-E-R-Y.
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:51.920]  Oh, you spelled it wrong.
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:53.440]  Which is funny because I spelled it wrong
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.280]  first time I was on your thing.
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:58.960]  A-T-E-C-H-E-R-Y.
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:45:59.900]  Strategy and tech.
[02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:01.240]  Once people hear strategy and tech,
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:03.500]  then they're like, oh, now the name makes total sense.
[02:46:03.500 --> 02:46:05.780]  I'm like, yeah, well, tell me about it.
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.880]  There's a good column this week on the iPad
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:14.920]  that we talked about here, but people should read it.
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:16.920]  And, of course, as you mentioned,
[02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:19.040]  a subscription newsletter,
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:20.600]  which everybody who listens to this show
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:21.920]  ought to at least consider.
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:23.420]  It's one of my favorite reads.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.600]  And you have two great Twitter accounts.
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:29.120]  You've got at Ben Thompson
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:30.440]  where you write about stuff like this,
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.080]  and then there's No Tech Ben
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:34.760]  where it's all Milwaukee Bucks all the time
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:35.640]  this time of year.
[02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:38.200]  Basically.
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:39.960]  Probably gets me in trouble, but whatever.
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:42.560]  Yeah, yeah, I have a really bad feeling.
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.040]  I mean, I'm not into the NBA like you,
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.320]  but I have a really bad feeling
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:50.320]  that we're heading towards a Sixers-Bucks Eastern Finals
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:52.700]  that's gonna end in five games.
[02:46:52.700 --> 02:47:02.700]  With the Bucks heading towards the Finals.
[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:06.240]  Well, the 76ers are terrible against everyone
[02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:08.640]  in part because they're basically expressly built
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:12.520]  to beat the Bucks, which is very concerning to me
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:14.280]  that they're gonna end up in the playoffs
[02:47:14.280 --> 02:47:16.160]  like the fifth or sixth seed or something,
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:17.700]  and we're gonna have to play them anyway,
[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:18.840]  and it's gonna be brutal.
[02:47:18.840 --> 02:47:21.360]  Obviously, they destroyed the Bucks on Christmas.
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:25.280]  I think it's probably a game that had concerning signs,
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:27.800]  to say the least, but also the shooting was such
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:29.440]  that it was a bit of an aberration,
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:33.840]  but it's gonna be, it would be a war for sure.
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:36.320]  Yeah, but anyway, they can find you there,
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.280]  and I wanna thank our sponsors this week.
[02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:43.280]  Feels, get your CBD, really interesting new sponsor.
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.080]  Glad to have them.
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:48.280]  Linode, where you can host your own server
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:51.180]  in the Linode Cloud, great, great company,
[02:47:51.180 --> 02:47:53.880]  and Casper, makers of fine mattresses
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:57.900]  and other sleep products, thanks.
[02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:25.880]  Thanks, Ben, talk to you soon.
