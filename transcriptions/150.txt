[00:00.960 --> 00:06.080]  Hey there. I feel like I just saw you. Well, I feel like I did just see you. I mean,
[00:07.440 --> 00:12.240]  it's not like one of those euphemisms. Boy, it seems like it was like Monday. Monday afternoon.
[00:15.920 --> 00:18.720]  What a week. Yeah, it's a big week.
[00:21.040 --> 00:24.800]  Did you see that Baseball Perspectives is launching an entire site devoted to the Mets?
[00:24.800 --> 00:30.720]  I had that moment of, like, the Mets. It turns out they've got a bunch of local sites. They
[00:30.720 --> 00:38.880]  already have a Bronx site for the Yankees. They don't have a Giants site, though. I feel slighted
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.000]  there. But it's baseball. It's coming. It's gotta be coming. Giants are too big. It's a big market.
[00:45.120 --> 00:49.040]  And they're a good team. I'm sure it'll happen. But ESPN did that. They launched like ESPN Boston
[00:49.040 --> 00:56.480]  or something. Yeah, exactly. ESPN has it in New York. Again, they never did a California even,
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.200]  let alone a Bay Area sports sub-site. I don't know what it is. I think it's because people
[01:01.200 --> 01:06.720]  in California don't care about sports. I think that's probably actually the fact, per capita.
[01:08.240 --> 01:15.600]  Some of us care about it, but most of us don't. Have you looked at the MLB app for Apple TV
[01:15.600 --> 01:23.040]  recently, like in the preseason? No, I haven't. It has regressed in some very disappointing ways.
[01:23.040 --> 01:27.520]  I think, and this is because people ask, you know, they probably ask you this. They definitely ask
[01:27.520 --> 01:31.840]  me this because I've written about that app a bunch, and I went to, I actually went to New York
[01:31.840 --> 01:40.480]  and met those guys, which was really cool to go to the MLB Advanced Media offices. And the good guys,
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.640]  they love the Apple platforms. They've got a great team of developers. They were really happy
[01:44.640 --> 01:53.680]  about the new Apple TV. Did you ever see their PlayStation app? No. Oh, it was amazing. I think
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.480]  maybe the Xbox One app is like this now, but there was a period in there where the PlayStation app
[01:58.480 --> 02:05.040]  was the MLB app. You could see the metadata that they would drop in of when there was a hit,
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.680]  or when there was a homer, or when there was a run, and you could use the PlayStation controller
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.120]  to like jump to the next scoring play. Just incredible amounts of data. It was way more
[02:15.120 --> 02:20.320]  complex than anything I've seen on any other platform. So I knew they were going to be excited
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.240]  about the Apple TV because they would be able to build an app instead of just sort of like a list
[02:24.240 --> 02:29.920]  of streams. But the problem with the MLB stuff is they make these press releases for spring training,
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.760]  but in reality, their ship date is like the first day of the season. So I am reluctant to write
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.240]  about their apps during spring training because they're, you know, first off, the like data
[02:42.240 --> 02:47.520]  that's being collected and the video that's being generated is not of, it's like substandard quality
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.640]  because it's not the regular season. So that's a big part of it. And I do think they're like,
[02:52.640 --> 02:57.280]  they're busy doing the app version that's going to release on opening day. And that's the one
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.560]  to write about because, you know, I bet that it's, yeah, what they've got on the Apple TV right now,
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.920]  what they've got on the iPad right now. It's like, yeah, it's okay. But it's like spring training
[03:05.920 --> 03:09.920]  mode. I feel like there's always a better version that drops at the end of March.
[03:10.560 --> 03:16.800]  I think so. I hope so. I think, though, that in this particular case, I think that they might be
[03:18.320 --> 03:22.560]  sort of, well, I was going to say behind the eight ball, but I might be, make some metaphors. But
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.080]  I feel like the platform changes are so significant that I think they'll get there eventually because,
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.760]  like you said, it's a phenomenal team and they really do care. But at the moment, it's
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.720]  really kind of weird how it's like worse than the old Apple TV app. Yeah, that's not good.
[03:38.720 --> 03:43.440]  That's not good. Like the big one is that you can't decide, like if you, let's say you start
[03:43.440 --> 03:48.160]  to watch a game after it started, but it's on. Like the game started at seven and you start
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.360]  watching at eight. You don't even get the choice anymore of whether you want to start from the
[03:51.360 --> 03:56.400]  beginning or watch live. It just sort of streams and puts you like, you know, 30 seconds behind
[03:56.400 --> 03:59.760]  live. Well, that's not good. No, they need to. But I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of it.
[03:59.760 --> 04:06.000]  Yeah, I'm sure they will. So you're a Yankee fan in Philly, so you're out of market.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.800]  So I'm very lucky. Right. So there was this big class action lawsuit about a lot of things
[04:12.800 --> 04:18.480]  involving sports leagues and video and in out of market video and stuff like that. And it's,
[04:20.160 --> 04:23.680]  things are changing starting this year. And one of the things that they changed is that they're
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.040]  offering like a one team in market streaming package. Would you buy that instead of the
[04:29.040 --> 04:34.000]  everything? It's like you could say 40 bucks or 30 bucks and, and just get Yankees games,
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.520]  or would you, do you want the whole spread or do you buy the package? Do you buy that?
[04:37.520 --> 04:42.320]  I do buy the package. No, I definitely buy it. And it's lucky. And for those of you who aren't
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.880]  sports fan, it's, you know, you got to listen to some sports talk on this show, but the gist of
[04:46.880 --> 04:53.280]  the in-market thing is, and it sounds crazy, but if you're not a sports fan, you might think it's
[04:53.280 --> 05:00.800]  super crazy. Is that like, if you live in the home market of a team, so let's say for me, that
[05:00.800 --> 05:08.560]  would be the Philadelphia Phillies. You can't stream their games home or away because the idea
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.000]  is you're supposed to pay for cable to get the channel on cable that pays to carry their games
[05:14.000 --> 05:19.440]  locally, but you can pay MLB. What is it like 120 a year? Well, so part of the, the settlement of
[05:19.440 --> 05:26.640]  the lawsuit, it's, it's a hundred this year. So for a hundred bucks, you can get the MLB thing,
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.280]  and you can watch every game except for the ones that, that are local to you. Yeah. But they
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.800]  definitely, you know, and I'm sure that there's ways around it with the VPNs and stuff like that,
[05:36.800 --> 05:42.160]  but it's tough on iOS though, because iOS has location services. So if you've got location
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.840]  services turned on, it's easier on a Mac to fake where you are in the world, but it's harder on an
[05:47.840 --> 05:52.640]  iPhone or an iPad. Right. Like the one time I was out, I remember it was like two years ago,
[05:52.640 --> 05:56.320]  I think it was two years ago, the Yankees were playing the Oakland Athletics and I was out for
[05:56.320 --> 06:00.640]  WWDC and I wanted to pop the game on my iPhone. And they were like, you can't watch it. And I'm
[06:00.640 --> 06:06.240]  like, oh, you must have the wrong location for me. And I'm like, oh, wait, you have the right
[06:06.240 --> 06:10.400]  location for me. It's, it's an A's game. It's, it's, it's one of those, I mean, this is not just
[06:10.400 --> 06:15.280]  a sports conversation because it's about like how technology is totally swamping the, the,
[06:15.280 --> 06:21.200]  the, the entertainment industry, that this is like a TV industry problem. And how do you protect,
[06:21.200 --> 06:24.080]  I mean, and it's very easy to say, well, people are cutting the cord. You just have to deal with
[06:24.080 --> 06:27.600]  it. It's stupid that they're not offering it. But like, if you look at the deal, the Dodgers signed
[06:28.240 --> 06:34.800]  their cable deal in LA is worth like $30 billion or something like that. It's insane. It is an
[06:34.800 --> 06:40.080]  amazing amount of money. And why is it that much money? And the answer is because the cable company
[06:40.080 --> 06:45.840]  figures that if they control the Dodgers TV rights, Dodger fans in LA can't cut the cord
[06:45.840 --> 06:51.600]  because they, they had, and that's why it's worth as much as it is, is, is because of that, which,
[06:51.600 --> 06:57.120]  you know, but at some point I don't know what happens at some point, cable goes down to the
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.120]  point where they're going to have to try to find another way to make money. The, one of the things
[07:01.120 --> 07:07.360]  about this the shift that's happening with that, that the, the, the class action settlement is
[07:07.360 --> 07:14.000]  in parallel, they're, they're making deals with local cable companies. So what's interesting
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.560]  about that is it means that if, if you have a cable login, so this is not for cord cutters,
[07:18.560 --> 07:23.440]  but like I used to work in downtown San Francisco, two blocks from the Giants Ballpark and I pay for
[07:23.440 --> 07:29.360]  cable. And, and yet I couldn't sit in my office and watch the Giants game that was happening
[07:29.360 --> 07:33.600]  because I was in the local market, even though I could watch it at home, or I could use like
[07:33.600 --> 07:39.040]  a Slingbox to watch it, and that's changing. They made a deal with most, but not all, it's like 22
[07:39.040 --> 07:45.280]  teams now, where if you've got a cable login, you can, you can watch the game, even, even if it's a
[07:45.280 --> 07:48.960]  local game, you can watch it. And that, that seems to be the next frontier for streaming, is going to
[07:48.960 --> 07:54.960]  be everything is unlocked if you're paying for cable in some form. Yeah, the weird thing, one of
[07:54.960 --> 07:58.800]  the weird things is that you don't see the commercials, or at least not the standard in the
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.400]  sometimes they sell other commercials, but usually that in the space between innings is just dead air
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.080]  and they're like, you know, in between innings or something like that, you know, standby game will
[08:08.080 --> 08:12.880]  come back. And I had the idea years ago, and you know, every time this has ever come up on the
[08:12.880 --> 08:16.880]  podcast, people write in and they say, why don't they just show the commercials? If the way they
[08:16.880 --> 08:22.080]  make money is to sell commercials, just show the same commercials to the people watching live.
[08:22.080 --> 08:27.520]  But it's what you said, which is that the cable companies see it as a reason to get cable. It's
[08:27.520 --> 08:31.440]  more than just the commercials. Yeah, they make, they make their money on cable subscriptions, not
[08:31.440 --> 08:34.880]  the commercials are a bonus. It's just like, you know, you pay for a magazine subscription back in
[08:34.880 --> 08:41.200]  the day, but it still had ads in the magazine. It's the, you get money from both, both streams come in,
[08:41.200 --> 08:46.080]  and that's how you fund whatever you're doing. And, and so I do wonder if part of the deal of
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.120]  showing local channels in local to people who are local cable subscribers is that they have to set
[08:51.120 --> 08:56.800]  up like a feed where you're, you're seeing the local ads, because they probably do want, that's
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.280]  probably one of the sticking points of the deal, right? Is they've, they've guaranteed their
[09:01.280 --> 09:06.640]  advertisers this coverage and that, you know, so that might be, that's a technical thing where, you
[09:06.640 --> 09:14.800]  know, you know, the Fox Sports Southwest has to feed the Diamondbacks games, uh, to MLB advanced
[09:14.800 --> 09:18.320]  media. It's probably, I mean, they're doing it anyway, but they probably feed a version with
[09:18.320 --> 09:21.520]  commercials to them or something. It's technical probably more than anything else, but that's why
[09:21.520 --> 09:27.360]  this is all complicated for all this stuff is. There are contracts and there's big money and
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.400]  there's technical limitations. And in, in, in, as tech people, we think, well, we can, we can solve
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.120]  this. We can solve this technologically. And then you realize, oh, it's not, tech is not the
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.960]  problem. Like MLB advanced media is like one of the most advanced streaming media organizations
[09:42.960 --> 09:47.120]  in the world. Maybe the most, they do so much for other people that people don't know about.
[09:47.120 --> 09:52.000]  They're, they're streaming the HBO now service. They've done CBS's sports stuff. I think they do
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.600]  ESPN stuff. I mean, they are a, a very good at what they do. Technical is not the problem. The
[09:57.600 --> 10:04.720]  problem is contracts that still exist and money where, you know, if, if a cable company in LA is
[10:04.720 --> 10:11.120]  going to pay $30 billion for, for 30 years or 20 years or whatever of, of rights to the Dodgers,
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.400]  then it's kind of hard to walk away from that. If you're, you know, if you're major league baseball,
[10:16.400 --> 10:20.000]  even if it does shut out cord cutters, cause that's a lot of money. Yeah. And remember that
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.720]  two years ago when HBO tried to do their own thing with HBO go, um, it, when the game of thrones
[10:26.720 --> 10:33.360]  premiere came out, it completely collapsed and they were, they were literally reduced to asking
[10:33.360 --> 10:38.720]  people, Hey, why don't you wait a day? They got rid of the guy too. I mean, that's the most shocking
[10:38.720 --> 10:44.320]  thing is the story is that their CTO was building this streaming infrastructure on the inside of
[10:44.320 --> 10:49.520]  HBO. And, um, and they were like, well, yeah, but we're, we're talking to major league baseball
[10:49.520 --> 10:52.240]  and we could use them. And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, we're going to do it. And then there
[10:52.240 --> 10:55.760]  was that one day where they like, they announced they were going to go with major league baseball
[10:55.760 --> 11:01.040]  and that guy was leaving the company. And then, and then last year with when they had the, uh,
[11:01.040 --> 11:08.160]  the MLB advanced media backed streaming system, it was apparently seamless. I mean, I guess it's
[11:08.160 --> 11:14.880]  never perfect for everybody, but even cables, not perfect for everybody. Um, the other weird thing
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.840]  on this, well, weird for me, cause as a Yankees fan, but it's, it's a lot of the preseason
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.480]  coverage is the fact that Comcast still doesn't have, they dropped the yes network, which is the
[11:24.480 --> 11:31.520]  Yankees entertainment and sports network that carries like, like at least 150 out of the 162
[11:31.520 --> 11:35.200]  games a year. There's like 12 that are on Fox, maybe a couple more than that. Cause there's some
[11:35.200 --> 11:42.080]  on ESPN, but 140 some games at least a year. Um, and Comcast dropped them in November and still
[11:42.080 --> 11:47.520]  hasn't picked them back up. So at this ad, you know, at least as of this recording Friday,
[11:47.520 --> 11:52.160]  March 25th, the Yankees, aren't going to be on TV. If you're in New York, if you have cable.
[11:52.160 --> 11:55.920]  Oh, so that's actually a very similar, uh, situation to what's happened in LA for people
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.720]  who don't know like LA Time Warner Cable has had, uh, this Dodgers deal and they have not been able
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.000]  to come to agreement with the other cable company or satellite providers that serve people in LA.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.400]  So there's a tiny percentage of people in LA who are able to see the bulk of the Dodger games on
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.480]  TV. And I think that's still not worked out, although I read somewhere that that was going
[12:16.480 --> 12:22.880]  to be worked out, but, um, it's kind of awful, but this is, you know, it's like, I talk about this.
[12:22.880 --> 12:26.400]  So I do every week, I do a podcast with Tim Goodman from the Hollywood Reporter, and we talk
[12:26.400 --> 12:30.720]  about this same thing a lot because it's transforming all entertainment. Uh, all TV is,
[12:30.720 --> 12:34.880]  is doing this and it's like a death spiral. I mean, they don't know where this is going.
[12:34.880 --> 12:41.520]  They are desperately paying money to try and hold on or, or mitigate how far the fall is,
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.280]  how fast it is. I mean, and so you end up in these situations where it makes no sense that
[12:47.280 --> 12:52.720]  the people of Los Angeles and New York can't see these baseball teams on their TV set. And yet
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.320]  this is where we are because they are, because there are bigger issues like the entire future
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.680]  of their industry that they feel are at play. Yeah. And I, I, it seems like it would only be
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.400]  fair if like Comcast doesn't have the Yankees and you're a Comcast company customer that you should
[13:08.400 --> 13:14.960]  be able to get the MLB app package, you know, but it doesn't work. I think you're just blocked out,
[13:14.960 --> 13:21.120]  which would, that would drive me nuts. I don't know. I mean, this, I, and it's like a lot of
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.120]  negotiations, you know, when there's, when there really is a hard deadline, which is opening day,
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.960]  which is a week away. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if a deal gets hammered out in the next
[13:28.960 --> 13:34.240]  week, but it just seems, you know, I don't know. Yeah. It's like, but like I said, dominating the
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.600]  pre-season talk about the Yankees because everybody's panicked that they're not gonna
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.680]  be able to watch the games. Well, and, and, um, some of the problems with this, I mean,
[13:41.680 --> 13:45.920]  this goes to business models, like on the web and everywhere else, which is getting people to pay
[13:45.920 --> 13:50.400]  for a premium service is great, but it's not the same as having everybody have it right. You lose
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.840]  this whole layer of casual fans in the case of baseball who are gonna flip on a game and watch
[13:55.840 --> 14:01.440]  it from time to time, but they're not gonna ever pay a hundred dollars a year to do that. Right.
[14:01.440 --> 14:06.000]  And so, and, and, and that's why they don't, that's why, you know, Time Warner Cable in LA
[14:06.000 --> 14:11.840]  is not going to create a Dodger fan package for everybody who isn't a Time Warner Cable customer
[14:11.840 --> 14:16.480]  to pay them $10 or $20 a month to watch the Dodgers, because that's not their end game.
[14:16.480 --> 14:22.000]  They want, they want to cut a deal with Comcast or whoever who, who will pay them, you know,
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.160]  a few dollars off of the bill of every single subscriber. And then it goes everywhere. It's
[14:26.160 --> 14:33.200]  like, um, I have a friend who's a cricket fan and he's in Canada and he, he watches all these like
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.440]  Indian cricket league matches. And I, I was like, oh, well, that's interesting. I could check that
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.560]  out. You can't get it in the US. Well, you can, but it's priced for the hardcore fan. They've
[14:42.560 --> 14:47.680]  gone the other way where it's like, you can't be a casual fan of that thing in America of cricket,
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.400]  because there are, there is a small group of people who love it and will pay like a hundred
[14:52.400 --> 14:57.920]  dollars to see one cricket tournament or whatever they call them. And, and, and that's what they're
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.320]  going for. And, you know, baseball doesn't want to do that. They want to be, these are mainstream
[15:02.320 --> 15:05.840]  sports. They want to make the deal where they get a huge amount of money and it's available to
[15:05.840 --> 15:13.600]  everybody. Um, and, uh, it makes me wonder about the future of, of, of broad appeal stuff. If
[15:13.600 --> 15:18.960]  everything is a la carte, because there's a lot of stuff that you're willing to watch if it's on,
[15:18.960 --> 15:26.880]  but are you willing to pay for it? That's very true. Um, all right, let's, cause as good a time
[15:26.880 --> 15:31.920]  any to take a break and thank our first sponsor. It's our old friends at backblaze. You guys know
[15:31.920 --> 15:38.320]  backplace online backup for, uh, your Mac. It also works on a PC. Uh, I haven't tried it on a PC
[15:38.320 --> 15:43.440]  cause I don't have one, but on the Mac, this is what I would recommend. Even if they don't,
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.280]  we're sponsoring a show. If you said, what should I do to back up my, my computer? I would tell you
[15:47.280 --> 15:51.520]  to have a system where you back up locally, back up, you know, use time machine, maybe use, I use
[15:51.520 --> 15:57.520]  super duper, make a, keep a clone of my startup drive. Um, but have something that is outside
[15:57.520 --> 16:04.000]  your office, out of your house, something offsite, just in case disaster strikes, uh,
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.800]  somebody breaks in, steals your computer, water damage, like something leaks over your desk,
[16:08.800 --> 16:13.520]  gets all over your computer, ruins everything. Who knows? Anything like that could happen.
[16:13.520 --> 16:19.520]  If you have an offsite backup, you don't lose all of your data. Um, these, this, these guys are
[16:19.520 --> 16:25.120]  great. They're former. The Mac version is written by former Apple engineers. It runs natively on
[16:25.120 --> 16:28.480]  your Mac. You'll never notice it. You don't have to put Java on your computer or anything like
[16:28.480 --> 16:32.400]  that. It's just native Mac OS 10 code. You'll never even notice that it's running. You just
[16:32.400 --> 16:38.000]  install it. Uh, you get a free trial at backblaze.com slash, uh, daring fireball.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.880]  You can start with a free trial, no credit card, no risk. Just try and see how easy it is,
[16:42.880 --> 16:50.000]  how seamless it is. And then when you're ready to go, it's an amazing deal. Um, it's just five
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.560]  bucks a month per computer and it's unlimited. There's no limit to how much data, the only limit
[16:54.560 --> 16:58.800]  on the data is how long it takes for you to do your first backup. And before it goes incremental,
[16:58.800 --> 17:04.720]  after that, um, you don't pay more if you have a lot of data, it's just five bucks per per Mac
[17:04.720 --> 17:09.600]  for unlimited backup. Uh, I said it before. I'll say it again someday. I hope that these guys stop
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.320]  sponsoring the show because everybody who listens to the show has signed up for it and has got their
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.960]  family members signed up for it too. And everything backed up to backblaze. Um,
[17:18.960 --> 17:24.160]  uh, and I'll just reiterate, you can restore one file at a time. Go to the website, find the file
[17:24.160 --> 17:28.720]  you want, get it. If you want to get everything back, you can order a USB hard drive. They'll put
[17:28.720 --> 17:34.400]  everything onto a hard drive and FedEx FedEx it to you. So whether you need everything or whether
[17:34.400 --> 17:39.760]  you just need one file backblaze works. So go to backblaze.com slash daring fireball and,
[17:39.760 --> 17:46.400]  and sign up now if you haven't, uh, I guess we should start with the, uh, with the event, right?
[17:46.400 --> 17:51.200]  We get to start with the event then talk about, uh, the actual devices. Yeah. I mean, that seems
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.520]  like a good place to start. That's everybody. So many, I say everybody, but so many complaints
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.680]  that it was, Oh, this is a boring event. Why did they have an event? I kind of more, I think about
[17:59.680 --> 18:04.720]  it. I think an event like this week's is actually more interesting if you're like an Apple nerd than
[18:04.720 --> 18:13.440]  the bigger ones, because I feel like it's a little bit more, uh, revealing it's. And, you know, for
[18:13.440 --> 18:20.400]  example, just for example, like JAWS is a segment, like how do you introduce a phone that has no,
[18:20.400 --> 18:26.160]  nothing new about it? It's a, it's a, well, think about it though. It's a design that we've seen
[18:26.160 --> 18:34.800]  before. Okay. So Rose gold is new, but we have seen Rose gold before, uh, and all of the stuff
[18:34.800 --> 18:43.200]  that's in the phone, the a nine processor, the camera from the iPhone six S, um, and, um,
[18:43.200 --> 18:49.360]  uh, being able to do Apple pay with the touch ID sensor. We've seen it all before. So how do you,
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.880]  how do you spend 10 or 15 minutes on stage talking about a phone that, that all the, everything I
[18:54.880 --> 19:00.320]  just said about is true and we saw it literally nothing, nothing new about that product other
[19:00.320 --> 19:07.040]  than the mixture of it. But, uh, you're right. The, the broad mainstream wants to see something
[19:07.040 --> 19:12.080]  like totally new blowing you away from Apple every single time, which is unrealistic,
[19:12.080 --> 19:15.680]  but that's why you always get the disappointing event every, every time, every time there's an
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.600]  Apple event, people say it's disappointing because that's just, unless it's the new iPhone,
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.160]  like the original iPhone or the original iPad, it's just not going to be exciting. But for us,
[19:24.160 --> 19:30.160]  you're right. You know, it becomes about like, how does Apple communicate something like the iPhone
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.640]  se and what is their positioning? Like, why would you do that? Why would you do something? Because
[19:34.640 --> 19:40.800]  although there's no parts in it that are, that are new, it is, uh, it is the first time they've
[19:40.800 --> 19:46.320]  ever done a product like this. So it is new strategy wise. And so if we care about strategy,
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.480]  then it's actually really interesting. Right. And I feel like that's a little bit,
[19:50.480 --> 19:54.000]  in a way, it's more interesting for us as the, you know, like I always say,
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.320]  Kremlinologists just sort of parse out what they're doing with this. Whereas if they had
[19:58.320 --> 20:04.480]  something altogether new that they could totally top secret thing to make the iPhone only two
[20:04.480 --> 20:08.960]  millimeters thick, like ridiculously thin, it's really just like a piece of glass. It looks like
[20:08.960 --> 20:16.800]  the phone from looper. Um, well that sells itself, right? It's like, that's not hard to pitch
[20:16.800 --> 20:20.080]  because you've got this thing that's like, Oh my God, just look at it. I can't believe they made
[20:20.080 --> 20:25.200]  that. Whereas this is a lot more strategic and it is, it's, it isn't this like, for example,
[20:25.200 --> 20:30.880]  this is the first time they've made a third phone from, uh, uh, an industrial design, right? There
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.920]  was the iPhone five, then the five S and now the new one, the se is used. It's the first time
[20:35.920 --> 20:41.440]  they've reused the design for the third time, physical design. Yeah. I mean, I guess you could,
[20:41.440 --> 20:46.960]  you could argue the five C is, is close to the design of the others, right? It's just the back,
[20:46.960 --> 20:51.920]  the back plate is kind of different, but, but yeah, it's, I guess it's a classic now. I mean,
[20:51.920 --> 20:57.760]  if you think about it, the, yeah, the four is five is just an elongated four in a lot of ways.
[20:57.760 --> 21:02.720]  So that's a, that's a design that has been with us for a very long time. And, uh, well,
[21:02.720 --> 21:08.160]  but similar, but not as similar as this where you could, if you took the, if you took the white one,
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.760]  I mean that space black is different cause they changed the color with the five and five S,
[21:11.760 --> 21:14.640]  but I think if you took the white one with the regular aluminum back,
[21:15.280 --> 21:20.800]  you would really have to get close to be able to tell a five five S. Yeah. They're dead ringers.
[21:20.800 --> 21:26.400]  I mean, I, I brought a five S with me to the event thinking this, this would be like this.
[21:26.400 --> 21:30.560]  I mean, I took some pictures and I mean, they're dead ringers. They, they fit in the same cases.
[21:30.560 --> 21:35.920]  The chamfer is matte instead of shiny. Uh, okay. The, like the printing on the back is different
[21:35.920 --> 21:40.240]  and the Apple on the back is different cause it's, I think screen printed in some way on the five S
[21:40.240 --> 21:45.040]  and it's like a stainless steel cutout like, um, like the modern phones on the, on the,
[21:45.040 --> 21:49.600]  on the new one on the se, but otherwise, I mean, they are, it's the same phone. It's not a,
[21:49.600 --> 21:56.480]  it's not a rethink of what that phone should be like. It is the old design with new insides.
[21:56.480 --> 22:04.720]  Yeah. I sort of, I think in a sense it to me makes it the, it's like the all time best iPhone design
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.240]  because it's the only one that got a third, a third show around. Yeah. I think, I think maybe
[22:08.240 --> 22:11.840]  you're right. I have a soft spot for the original iPhone design. I was saying to somebody the other
[22:11.840 --> 22:16.960]  day that I feel like the original iPhone is both my favorite design and also has some of the worst
[22:16.960 --> 22:23.440]  design elements in it of any iPhone. But, um, I, I do, I kind of like how, how rounded the,
[22:23.440 --> 22:28.080]  that original iPhone is, but, um, but the five design is great and I like it a lot.
[22:28.720 --> 22:34.480]  I saw somebody on Twitter was asking for an iPhone se case that is as close as possible
[22:34.480 --> 22:38.480]  to the original iPhone. Like it would have to be longer obviously because the screen's longer, but
[22:39.200 --> 22:42.960]  that was a good design too. It was, it was, although I laugh at it now cause I've got
[22:42.960 --> 22:46.240]  one here and I look at it every now and then when a new iPhone comes out and it's like
[22:46.240 --> 22:50.000]  the, some of it is really beautiful. And then there's like the Chrome cause it's got like
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.880]  that soft brought like the brushed aluminum back, but the front has got the shiny Chrome frame and
[22:54.880 --> 23:00.240]  I'm like, wow, that's not, I mean, they would not have ever done that after that. It was,
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.080]  but that was what they did. You could see they were just getting their, their feet wet. They
[23:04.080 --> 23:08.960]  were learning at that point. I feel like they've come so far in terms of how they fit pieces
[23:08.960 --> 23:14.080]  together in that in, in, across all of their devices, really. Like if you look back and
[23:14.080 --> 23:21.120]  think to like the, the titanium power book, which was sort of the forebearer of all modern
[23:21.840 --> 23:27.040]  power books and Mac books. I mean, and it, I mean it was even made of a different material.
[23:27.040 --> 23:30.800]  They didn't get to aluminum yet. And there were a lot of problems with the titanium, with the
[23:31.360 --> 23:36.080]  flaking off of the coating. And, but the, the big difference to me was that there were
[23:36.080 --> 23:40.960]  little plastic pieces across all of the seams. Like they couldn't just make a corner out of
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.840]  titanium. It, it all needed to be sealed up with a plastic corner. And the original iPhone was sort
[23:45.840 --> 23:50.160]  of like that too, where they needed like a, like a piece, like literally it was like a piece of
[23:50.160 --> 23:54.720]  Chrome around the display between the display and the aluminum. And they had like the black cut out
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.760]  at the, at the bottom. That was, I mean, it was just, that was what they needed to do to assemble
[23:59.760 --> 24:04.000]  the thing. And then the, and then the next generation phones were the, well, what if we
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.880]  just have a big polycarbonate back? And, and then with the four was like, all right, we figured out
[24:08.880 --> 24:12.720]  how to do this. And everything comes from that, just like you're right. The titanium power book,
[24:12.720 --> 24:19.360]  every MacBook has looked like that since then. I mean, within, they've all essentially, you could
[24:19.360 --> 24:23.520]  tell they're all of a kind. That was the moment where they went from being like black and brown
[24:23.520 --> 24:30.800]  plastic to, to being that, that silver laptop that we know now. Right. I mean, and just in little
[24:30.800 --> 24:34.160]  ways, I mean, if you compare it, if we're going to go down memory lane and compare it to the original
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.840]  iPhone, you could just see how the whole industry, not just Apple has come so far in 15 years or so
[24:39.840 --> 24:43.680]  of like wireless where wireless stuff used to always have like an actual antenna. Yeah. You
[24:43.680 --> 24:48.400]  know what I mean? Like, I remember seeing like, uh, Palm trios, where there'd be like an actual
[24:48.400 --> 24:53.360]  antenna up in the upper right corner. I had one of those. Yeah, it absolutely did. And everybody
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.440]  just accepted it because it was amazing. You know, I'm talking on the phone and I'm not connected to
[24:57.440 --> 25:02.160]  any wires. Of course, there's gotta be an antenna. And then, you know, to go to come so far, we're
[25:02.160 --> 25:07.360]  like in 2007, we complained about the black plastic on the back of the iPhone because it
[25:07.360 --> 25:13.120]  needed to be plastic to get the antenna signals through. And it's, we complained about that just
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.560]  because this didn't look great. Yeah, it's, well, it's, it's kind of hard to think that it's been
[25:18.560 --> 25:24.880]  less than 10 years and, um, the whole industry, I mean, this has been talked about a lot that
[25:24.880 --> 25:29.600]  it's not just how much better people have gotten at phones, which is absolutely true. Everybody has
[25:29.600 --> 25:34.240]  gotten better at phones, but the, the drive to make smartphones and the miniaturization of,
[25:34.240 --> 25:40.400]  of all this tech has led to all of these other spinoff devices, because once you build these tiny
[25:41.120 --> 25:46.240]  computers, you could do all sorts of other stuff with them too. And it's less than 10 years. That's
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.200]  I was on some podcast where I said that I thought that, uh, in the end, the smartphone,
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.240]  the computer era would be seen as a footnote to the smartphone era, that that was like,
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.880]  remember when we first made computers, you couldn't put them in your pocket as opposed to
[26:00.880 --> 26:04.640]  how we think of it now, which is, Oh, now you can put a computer in your pocket. It's like,
[26:04.640 --> 26:08.480]  I don't think in, in, in terms of history, that's how we're going to think about it. It's like,
[26:08.480 --> 26:13.360]  it's already in less than 10 years changed so much about how people interact, uh, all around
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.040]  the world that, you know, that that's, and, and has driven so much new technology. Yeah, totally.
[26:19.760 --> 26:25.680]  Um, all right, back to the event. So here's, here's a question let's go through. I have my
[26:25.680 --> 26:31.600]  notes now. I have, let's go through it in order. So Tim Cook comes out and starts with, uh, well,
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.680]  there's the 40 sec, 40 years and 40 seconds thing, which was delightful, um, uh, included a Newton
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.320]  joke. Uh, people forget that. I mean, or people don't know that that, that crossing out the Newton
[26:42.320 --> 26:47.280]  wasn't just malicious. That was the, that was the actual pen stroke you use to erase a word.
[26:48.400 --> 26:52.400]  I didn't notice that they actually went to that detail. I did not notice that. Oh yeah. It's the,
[26:52.400 --> 26:56.160]  it's that little up and down zigzag across the word. And then what they didn't, they didn't have
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.400]  time to have the little puff of smoke. Right. But that's, I mean, that was the Newton gesture
[27:00.400 --> 27:06.080]  for that. So that was deep, deep knowledge by whoever made that video with a little bit of love.
[27:06.080 --> 27:12.800]  Yeah. Um, and then he came out and he addressed the, uh, as we say, the elephant in the room,
[27:12.800 --> 27:18.400]  which was the, at the time on Monday, Apple's pending court case against the FBI the next day.
[27:18.400 --> 27:26.240]  Um, and I thought he spoke very well on it and that yeah, he's spoken well on it ever since this,
[27:26.240 --> 27:33.840]  this issue started in early February, but I feel like he's, he's gotten it down to a much
[27:33.840 --> 27:40.160]  more compelling, uh, argument. And he's like, for example, like earlier, like a few weeks ago,
[27:40.160 --> 27:47.600]  he was comparing the creation of government OS to, he analogized it to cancer. Um, and I think
[27:47.600 --> 27:50.880]  I know where he was going with that, but he's dropped that analogy. And I think it's for the
[27:50.880 --> 27:55.840]  best that he did because it doesn't hold up as well. Uh, and the main reason I think is because
[27:55.840 --> 28:01.520]  cancer isn't manmade. It's, you know, it's a, this, I mean, there's manmade causes that you
[28:01.520 --> 28:07.440]  can lead you to get it, but it's, you know, the fact that it exists is an unfortunate aspect of
[28:07.440 --> 28:14.640]  nature and our biology. Um, uh, I think it's, if you're going to go that route, it's a little
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.440]  bit more like asking a company to make, you know, requiring a company to manufacture chemical
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.080]  weapons, but that's an analogy that I don't think he wants to use. I think it's a better analogy,
[28:24.080 --> 28:27.920]  but I don't think you want to use it because it's, it's too unpleasant. Um,
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.120]  I thought that the thing that he said that really was the way that I think that this should go is
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.720]  when he said that we see our, we even see our phones as an extension of ourselves. And that
[28:38.720 --> 28:44.640]  to me is the, that's the angle that the, and I know that the case, this particular case has been
[28:44.640 --> 28:48.800]  dropped, but the issue is definitely not going to go away. And I feel like that's the angle to go
[28:48.800 --> 28:56.160]  toward in terms of, yes, we are actually building warrant resistant phones. Yeah. You, um, you did
[28:56.160 --> 29:03.040]  a, you had a post and a link that I thought was really great. That was, um, calling somebody on
[29:03.040 --> 29:09.360]  this argument, like, do we dare create a warrant proof space? Do we dare do that place where
[29:09.360 --> 29:14.400]  warrants can't reach? And the point, the point that you linked to is that somebody said was
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.880]  our, our minds are a warrant proof place, the concept of a place that is, and historically,
[29:20.880 --> 29:25.040]  there have been other places that are essentially warrant proof, but certainly
[29:25.040 --> 29:31.680]  our, our minds are ours and, uh, the, the information in them is not subject to a warrant.
[29:31.680 --> 29:35.920]  And I think that I thought the same thing when he said that, that this is, this is the,
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.920]  one of the key parts of Apple's argument is our phones are extensions of ourselves. There are,
[29:41.920 --> 29:47.120]  there are not even backup brains. They're part of our brains. They, um, are where we keep
[29:47.120 --> 29:52.560]  information. So we don't have to store it in our brains. It makes life better that way. This is how
[29:52.560 --> 29:59.440]  people live in the 21st century. And therefore protecting that is an extension of the protection
[29:59.440 --> 30:03.760]  that we've got essentially against self-incrimination. This is part of our, uh,
[30:03.760 --> 30:09.440]  this is part of our mind. And if, if the math means that the technology exists to lock something
[30:09.440 --> 30:18.000]  up and nobody can get to it, uh, then we perhaps we're all best off considering it that considering
[30:18.000 --> 30:23.200]  it the extension of a warrant proof space that already exists on our mind. So I definitely,
[30:23.200 --> 30:26.880]  you know, he didn't go into it beyond just saying it's an extension of ourselves, but,
[30:26.880 --> 30:30.880]  you know, you, you and I had the same thought, which is you read between the lines there. And
[30:30.880 --> 30:35.440]  that is what Apple is saying is you can't pry it out of our head. And my phone is part of my head.
[30:35.440 --> 30:42.320]  It is, it is, it is who I am. And, um, if I can make it so that you can't see what's in there,
[30:42.320 --> 30:48.480]  um, then that's okay. That's part of, that's part of the deal. Yeah. Um, and then
[30:48.480 --> 30:57.440]  the FBI called a nevermind for mind. Well, you saw those, the, the legal analysis again,
[30:57.440 --> 31:01.440]  we're not lawyers, but you saw the legal analysis, uh, over the weekend and the past week,
[31:01.440 --> 31:07.280]  which was sort of like, this isn't looking good for the FBI. There's so many reasons that this,
[31:07.280 --> 31:11.440]  that this is, uh, that Apple seems to have the advantage here. And the tide seemed to turn,
[31:11.440 --> 31:16.480]  I think even publicly, the, I think the FBI thought this was a slam dunk, you know, I think
[31:16.480 --> 31:20.080]  they, they thought that they were going to be able to do this and Apple was going to roll over
[31:20.080 --> 31:23.040]  and the people were going to be on their side because they're talking about terrorism and
[31:23.040 --> 31:27.360]  protecting a terrorist phone and all of these things. And then the tide starts to turn their
[31:27.360 --> 31:32.880]  legal footing is, is kind of, uh, not as solid as they thought it would be. Um, and then, so all of
[31:32.880 --> 31:37.840]  a sudden they say, well, we found another way. So nevermind, which even that excuse is terrible
[31:37.840 --> 31:41.840]  because they basically said, no, no, no, there is no other way we've searched everywhere.
[31:41.840 --> 31:46.400]  And everybody went, really? And then they're like, nevermind. Um, it's hard not to look at
[31:46.400 --> 31:51.440]  that and say that the political calculation, either they made it that this wasn't a good
[31:51.440 --> 31:59.760]  time to do this or somebody else in the executive branch was like, yeah, don't, don't just cut,
[31:59.760 --> 32:05.120]  just don't write or, or go talk to the NSA or what, whatever it was, but something happened,
[32:05.680 --> 32:11.040]  figure out as graceful a way as possible to get out of this, even if it's actually not graceful
[32:11.040 --> 32:17.840]  at all. Uh, yeah. And I think that it, it backfired on the FBI in two ways is I kind of,
[32:17.840 --> 32:22.960]  I kind of get the feeling that they maybe never thought that this would go to actual trial,
[32:23.520 --> 32:28.640]  but they thought it would be the other way that the, and that public opinion would, would go
[32:28.640 --> 32:33.840]  against Apple so overwhelmingly that, okay, Apple thinks they want to fight this, but we'll, you
[32:33.840 --> 32:39.120]  know, we'll turn up the temperature on the terrorism dial and they'll, they'll find out
[32:39.120 --> 32:45.360]  otherwise. And that didn't happen. Like, and, and it certainly is not the case that the public was
[32:45.360 --> 32:50.880]  overwhelmingly in Apple's favor, but it was close to 50 50. And from the polls that I did see,
[32:50.880 --> 32:55.920]  you know, it seemed like it was slowly moving in Apple's favor. It certainly wasn't backfiring
[32:55.920 --> 33:01.360]  on Apple. And I think that the FBI wasn't prepared for that. And then the FBI looked at the, what did
[33:01.360 --> 33:05.280]  their legal arguments were? And we're like, shit, if we go to, we go to trial, this does not look
[33:05.280 --> 33:11.920]  good. So what I, and the other thing that they did that was sort of like just dancing around and,
[33:11.920 --> 33:16.640]  you know, changing their mind, it was like three or like Friday or Thursday or Friday,
[33:16.640 --> 33:19.840]  but three or four days before it was supposed to go to trial, they changed, they, they said,
[33:19.840 --> 33:23.360]  we would like this to be an evidentiary hit or hearing where we call witnesses,
[33:25.520 --> 33:30.080]  which, you know, it's not like that's unusual in and of itself, but it's unusual to do, you know,
[33:30.080 --> 33:34.480]  request it at the last minute. And I, my theory, and again, I'm just making this up. I don't have
[33:34.480 --> 33:38.800]  any information to back it up, but my guess is that they, they looked at the legal arguments,
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.880]  said, we're kind of screwed. Maybe if we call some witnesses, we can make this a little bit
[33:42.880 --> 33:50.160]  less about the facts and a little bit more like an emotional appeal, you know, a gut appeal to,
[33:50.160 --> 33:57.280]  you know, we're trying to fight terrorism here. And then I think they realized over the weekend
[33:57.280 --> 34:00.400]  that that really, you know, when they thought about it, that really wasn't going to work either.
[34:00.400 --> 34:06.160]  Yeah, I think it is a combination of the law and the optics that happened to them.
[34:06.800 --> 34:13.360]  The optics, you're, you're exactly right. I think they expected that the people would be mixed on
[34:13.360 --> 34:18.080]  this. And then when they heard about the details of Apple withholding information from a terrorist,
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.320]  that the public would swing to their side and it didn't do that. It was the reverse of that,
[34:22.320 --> 34:26.560]  that people learned more about this issue and started to understand why Apple was fighting it.
[34:26.560 --> 34:31.760]  So I think they miscalculated. And then yeah, they, Apple brings in Ted Olson, right? I mean,
[34:31.760 --> 34:38.960]  Apple like lawyered up to, to fight this as far as possible. And, you know, I, I think you put
[34:38.960 --> 34:43.760]  those two together and, and there's a, and, and they always had to have the knowledge that there
[34:43.760 --> 34:49.520]  was, even if they didn't know there were zero day exploits that they could probably use. I'm sure
[34:49.520 --> 34:54.240]  they, I'm sure they knew that they could find one if they wanted. It was like in their back pocket
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.080]  a little bit. And so that was the escape hatches. Oh, oh, we think let's put this on hold because
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.520]  it's not dismissed. It's just on hold for now. Um, but I, I, yeah, it seems like it's, it seems
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.240]  like it's over. I, and the one thing I noticed and it's, it, it really, I don't think you can
[35:11.280 --> 35:18.320]  overstate how much Apple is truly standing on principle here in that it's, you know,
[35:18.320 --> 35:22.080]  whether you think it's good marketing or not. And I think that Apple really bristled at that
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.760]  accusation from the FBI that they were doing this for marketing purposes because so it, whether it
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.960]  helps them in marketing or not is beside the point they truly at. And obviously I think from,
[35:32.960 --> 35:37.520]  you know, starting at the very top with Tim Cook right on down, really see it as a matter of
[35:37.520 --> 35:43.200]  principle. And, and the reason it's a little unusual to see a company do something like that
[35:43.200 --> 35:48.000]  is that you could see it in the polling that, that their negatives, as they say in politics
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.320]  have gone way up. Like it was like before this, like the last time the same polling group had it,
[35:54.320 --> 35:58.400]  it was like, you know, how many people have an unfavorable opinion of Apple? And it was like 8%
[35:58.400 --> 36:05.280]  and it's probably just a bunch of, you know, it's like the people who hate the Mac, right? It's the
[36:05.280 --> 36:11.760]  people who get into Mac versus PC flame Wars on the internet. Um, but like, as of like last week,
[36:11.760 --> 36:15.840]  it was up to like 21% or something like that. So like the number of people in the United States
[36:15.840 --> 36:22.640]  with an unfavorable opinion of Apple, like more than doubled, almost tripled, um, just because
[36:22.640 --> 36:27.360]  of this issue, just because of the very, you know, and, and thinking about it in very broad terms,
[36:27.360 --> 36:34.400]  Apple is spitefully not helping the FBI unlock a phone that belongs to terrorists. Um, and that's
[36:34.400 --> 36:40.320]  just like, that's the sort of PR that companies, you know, for good reason don't want. Yeah,
[36:40.320 --> 36:44.480]  that's the worst, the worst PR, right? The easiest thing to do is go along like the,
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.000]  like all the phone companies did. And like a lot of tech companies have done, which is just go
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.320]  along, keep it quiet. Don't talk about the tap that you put in for the government. Don't talk
[36:52.320 --> 36:58.160]  about this, you know, this work you do or this loophole that you've got. Um, that, that's
[36:58.160 --> 37:02.000]  certainly the best, right? Cause then it's like, nobody talks about it. You, you risk having
[37:02.000 --> 37:07.840]  something like what happened with AT&T blow up where it's revealed that there's this warrantless
[37:07.840 --> 37:13.920]  wire tapping going on in your telecom center. There are risks there, but, um, but still, yeah,
[37:13.920 --> 37:17.200]  Apple's putting itself out there and they know that they're going to get portrayed by the United
[37:17.200 --> 37:23.760]  States government of all places, the law and order wing of the United States government as being
[37:23.760 --> 37:29.200]  on the side of terrorism, essentially. I mean, there's a Senator who stood in the Senate and
[37:29.200 --> 37:36.000]  declared that Apple was on the side of ISIS, right? I mean, this is bad PR, but I do think,
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.600]  I do think that they, they're principled. And when we talk about this whole section of the,
[37:39.600 --> 37:44.960]  of the keynote or the, the media event, not just Tim Cook, but, uh, when we went on to talk about
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.400]  the health stuff and about the environment stuff too, um, you know, it is a PR calculation. It's
[37:50.400 --> 37:55.520]  a media event. It is always going to be a PR calculation, but I do believe that it's also
[37:56.240 --> 38:01.440]  a, uh, a cultural thing at Apple that they, they, I, I don't believe they just do this for good PR.
[38:01.440 --> 38:06.480]  This is part of who they are and the philosophy they have about, uh, about their products and
[38:06.480 --> 38:12.480]  how they're used. Yeah. I think that the environment thing is a perfect example of that,
[38:12.480 --> 38:16.800]  because however many people care about it, I really think that the, the number of
[38:18.480 --> 38:24.400]  iPhones and iPads that they sell because Apple has a good stance toward the environment is like,
[38:24.400 --> 38:29.280]  you know, you could, one person could carry them upstairs. You know what I mean? It's not,
[38:29.280 --> 38:33.680]  there are not very many people who are making their decision on what to buy based on the
[38:33.680 --> 38:38.640]  environmental policies of the company. It's, you know, I think Lisa Jackson even said it,
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.600]  that you can feel good about Apple's environment. It's, it's a way to make you feel good about it,
[38:43.600 --> 38:47.840]  but it's not, it's not going to sell it. And you can't help but think that it's costing them
[38:48.480 --> 38:54.160]  a significant amount of money. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think so, but they, they've been,
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.960]  this is one of those funny cases where I feel like they turn the corner too, that they got rebuked by
[38:58.960 --> 39:04.880]  Greenpeace like 10 years ago. And, and within a year or two, they started putting up that,
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.080]  that slide that is on every product launch now, which is the green checklist, which, you know,
[39:10.080 --> 39:13.600]  they don't have to do that. They really don't have to do it now when they always just check all the
[39:13.600 --> 39:18.800]  boxes, but they, they, they have done a lot to make their products more recyclable and less,
[39:18.800 --> 39:23.040]  less toxic. And now they're doing things where they're, you know, they're buying electricity.
[39:23.040 --> 39:27.040]  It's not all, it's not as if like they've got solar panels on other buildings and all
[39:27.040 --> 39:32.480]  their buildings. Some of it is like, there's a huge solar farm in central California that
[39:32.480 --> 39:37.040]  they basically bought and said, we want all the power from this. But they, they want to,
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.000]  they want to say that and they want to talk about that. And that is, you know, I, again,
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.480]  I think it's good PR because it says we care, but I also think that they do actually care.
[39:47.120 --> 39:55.520]  Yeah. And the other thing worth noting, I mean, it's, but Lisa Jackson being on stage is noteworthy
[39:55.520 --> 40:02.480]  because a she's never been on stage at an event before and B you know, in the last few years,
[40:02.480 --> 40:09.840]  there's been a growing awareness that most of the people Apple puts up on stage are white men.
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.680]  Yep. And anything, anybody who's you know, can broaden the
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.280]  diversity of the people who are on stage. It's a good thing in multiple ways, but it's, you know,
[40:23.280 --> 40:27.920]  I brought it up with Phil Schiller when he was on the show at WWDC and, and he made the point,
[40:27.920 --> 40:36.400]  which is exactly what I suspected is true, is that it's not like they pick people to do, you know,
[40:36.400 --> 40:39.920]  like here's, who's going to do this. It's people who are responsible for the thing that they're
[40:39.920 --> 40:45.840]  pitching who do it. Right. Like, so when Jaws comes up to do the iPhone SE, it Jaws is it,
[40:45.840 --> 40:50.720]  not just a person who does, you know, who does product marketing, he's product marketing for
[40:50.720 --> 40:55.600]  iPhone. Yeah. And so the fact that Lisa Jackson was on stage, she wasn't going to come out on
[40:55.600 --> 41:01.360]  stage to talk about the iPhone SE it's because she's literally in charge of Apple's environmental
[41:01.920 --> 41:07.520]  policy. Yeah, I do think they're, they're definitely making an attempt. I, it seems to me
[41:07.520 --> 41:15.120]  that they're asking the question, like, how can we, how can we better you know, reflect diversity
[41:15.120 --> 41:21.920]  on stage and in videos and all those things. And they're, they are not close to being sort of what
[41:21.920 --> 41:27.760]  you see from a Google event or even a Microsoft event. But they're, you can see that they're
[41:27.760 --> 41:33.120]  working on getting better. I noticed not just Lisa Jackson, but in the videos, there were,
[41:33.760 --> 41:42.080]  there were two videos featuring Apple employees. And one of them, a video was narrated by an Apple
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.840]  product manager who is Asian. And there was one that was, that featured one of the health videos,
[41:47.840 --> 41:55.040]  featured an Apple employee who is an Indian woman. And so I did notice like the people in the people,
[41:55.040 --> 41:59.440]  not, and not just like the kids in the health study and all that, but like the representatives
[41:59.440 --> 42:04.080]  of Apple in those videos were people we hadn't seen before, voices we hadn't heard before,
[42:04.080 --> 42:10.160]  and who do show some more of the diversity that is in existence at Apple. And, you know, what I read
[42:10.160 --> 42:16.000]  that is that they're making an effort. And it's not like, I mean, it's not like there's an
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.640]  incredibly diverse group on stage and that Apple's totally turned the corner. I guess what I would
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.200]  say is that I think they're aware of the perception of it and are trying to take some steps,
[42:25.200 --> 42:29.520]  but you know, they got, they got more work to do, but it was, it was, it's good to see new,
[42:29.520 --> 42:35.440]  new people from Apple on stage. This is, it's not just about Apple's diversity. It's also like Apple
[42:35.440 --> 42:41.120]  used to be the least diverse company in the world because there was literally like a guy who did
[42:41.120 --> 42:46.400]  almost everything publicly, right? Steve Jobs wanted to be the face of everything Apple did.
[42:46.400 --> 42:49.920]  And you're saying they were the least diverse in terms of their public, in terms of their public
[42:49.920 --> 42:55.520]  persona, because it was one guy. It was Steve Jobs was Apple, right? And I think he cultivated that
[42:55.520 --> 43:00.160]  and he, he was, he was good at it. So why not do it? And I feel like Apple's corporate culture is
[43:00.160 --> 43:06.000]  still continues to unwind and with Katie Cotton leaving and Steve Dowling taking over for NPR,
[43:06.000 --> 43:12.800]  I feel like they're still, they're still unwinding out to be like, lots of people are work at Apple
[43:12.800 --> 43:16.960]  and let's get those voices on stage. And it was, it started with sort of a small group of people
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.920]  who we already knew who would pop up during Steve Jobs' keynotes. And now it keeps widening.
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.520]  And, um, and I expected to keep doing that, but it's kind of funny that, you know, I, I really
[43:27.520 --> 43:33.360]  think they have, they, they are trying to change, but they have to change from a model where like,
[43:33.360 --> 43:38.160]  nobody gets on stage except Steve and maybe a couple of lieutenants. And they don't, I think
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.240]  they, I think they know they need to not do that anymore. Yeah. And I don't think they're ever
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.920]  going to go the route of Google who like in a Google IO keynote, there might be 20 people who
[43:47.920 --> 43:52.000]  come on stage. I mean, maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but it's, it's a lot, it's a lot of people
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.240]  coming out for a brief, you know, almost like individual features, you know, here's somebody
[43:58.240 --> 44:04.240]  else to do this. Um, and Apple's style of presentation is, isn't going to change because
[44:04.240 --> 44:08.560]  I think that they, you know, I think it works, you know, and I think they believe it works.
[44:08.560 --> 44:15.440]  There's a certain style to an Apple show, you know, and it's, it's fewer speakers coming out for
[44:16.720 --> 44:20.880]  longer segments, you know, and then maybe somebody, you know, like at WWDC,
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.560]  there's a couple of things where they'll have somebody come out to do the demo. Right. And,
[44:24.560 --> 44:30.000]  and there's, you know, but it's just, it's just inherently a little different. Uh, the one thing
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.600]  with the Lisa Jackson thing, I didn't comment on it. I, in my writeup on my thoughts and
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.440]  observations, but one of the things that a couple of readers called me on and I have to say
[44:39.440 --> 44:48.400]  correctly. So is it's a little disingenuous to, um, what I call her segment out on is the,
[44:48.400 --> 44:52.560]  that they pitched it as sort of like Apple is helping to save the climate. And I think
[44:52.560 --> 45:00.080]  that's a little, it's a little self, uh, centered. Cause I don't really think Apple's footprint as
[45:00.080 --> 45:04.560]  big as a company as they are is single-handedly really going to move the dial on the overall
[45:04.560 --> 45:08.400]  climate of the planet. I think that they should pitch it more. I really do. Cause I think,
[45:08.400 --> 45:13.200]  and I think this is where it could help is pitch it more as we're setting an example that we want
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.840]  all of our other fellow companies in the fortune 500 to follow. We're showing that it's possible
[45:17.840 --> 45:25.920]  to be a hundred percent renewable. Um, why is, why aren't other companies doing the same? Um,
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.960]  and I still believe that, but the other thing I didn't mention and I did think about it was that
[45:30.960 --> 45:38.800]  they, they're, they're very carefully omitting their supply chain from, from their measurements.
[45:38.800 --> 45:43.760]  Right. And I don't know, it would be interesting. I mean, I'll, cause that's one thing like Tim
[45:43.760 --> 45:50.320]  cook is a numbers guy. So I bet that he, you know, has those numbers coming from Lisa Jackson's team,
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.840]  which is what's the, what's the environmental footprint of, of our supply chain. Um, and I would
[45:55.840 --> 46:00.480]  be interested to know how big that is compared to the rest of Apple's operations. One of the
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.200]  interesting things, um, and I've seen Ben Thompson write about this at Stratechery a little bit. Um,
[46:05.200 --> 46:09.760]  and a guy, Ramez Nam, who is a science fiction writer, but he also writes about, uh, the future
[46:09.760 --> 46:15.760]  of renewable energies. He's written about it a lot that China is really changing, um, to the point
[46:15.760 --> 46:24.640]  where China's path to renewable energy from coal basically is, uh, it's rapid. It's happening rapid,
[46:24.640 --> 46:32.160]  rapidly because, um, partially because their pollution is horrible. Um, but, uh, it's
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.560]  interesting. I wonder if there's a, there's something behind the scenes where they talk
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.600]  to their supply chain and, and are leaning on them to do this because I think there's opportunity in
[46:41.600 --> 46:47.840]  the grid, uh, in China, knowing nothing about, about the details of Chinese, uh, energy systems,
[46:47.840 --> 46:53.280]  but the country as a whole is adding huge amounts of renewables, um, and is going to keep doing that
[46:53.280 --> 46:57.840]  for a long time to come. So I do wonder if that's happening in the background too, that maybe there's
[46:57.840 --> 47:04.000]  even a thought like, look, these guys are all going to be switching to, you know, or investing in,
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.880]  uh, you know, solar in China. And well, there are advantages to running an authoritarian government.
[47:10.880 --> 47:15.600]  I mean, right. You can, you know, you can make the trains run on time a little easier. Yeah. Well,
[47:15.600 --> 47:18.960]  and I, I just don't know how to handle their grid and whether you can, you can say like,
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.960]  we're going to buy power here and we want the credit for that being our power, the, the,
[47:22.960 --> 47:28.240]  that wind farm that you built, let's say that that's the Hanhai wind farm. And, and that's the,
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.400]  I mean, that's the truth of a grid in general is that you're essentially buying offsets. I mean,
[47:32.400 --> 47:38.960]  when Apple, when Apple puts, um, the, uh, that, that solar farm that's south of Monterey to,
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.320]  to work, um, it's not like there's an Apple campus right there. That's wired to it. It goes
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.480]  Or a big cable, one big, one big power cord, like the, uh, uh, John Fogerty video.
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.320]  Yeah. Yeah. You just plug it in and then you got it. Um, no, it just goes into the grid and,
[47:54.320 --> 47:58.560]  and then the electrons are in the grid and then they take, but they get the credit for that
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.880]  generation. So, you know, electricity is weird, but they, they're, they're trying. And I would
[48:02.880 --> 48:06.720]  imagine that the, that the supply chain is probably going to get better just because I,
[48:06.720 --> 48:10.000]  I get the impression that the energy mix in China is going to get better,
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.200]  but you know, who knows? You're, you're, you're right. I'm sure Tim Cook knows.
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.200]  Uh, well they're conspicuously avoided mentioning it and you know, I don't know. I don't really
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.120]  blame them. I think if, you know, if I was on their team, I probably would have said,
[48:23.120 --> 48:26.160]  yeah, we don't want to, let's just not mention it. I think, I think you're right though. Apple
[48:26.160 --> 48:30.320]  wants to be, I think it would be great if Apple was just more an example of like, look, this is
[48:30.320 --> 48:34.560]  how a big company can do this. And if you want to be a big company that can say, look, we're standing
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.720]  up and we're going to be a hundred percent renewables by this date, you can do it. Cause
[48:38.720 --> 48:44.080]  Apple did it. And, and even say like, here's what it cost us. Um, and it's realistic about how much
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.760]  it costs so that it, you know, cause that's one of the arguments always. It's like, well, we don't
[48:47.760 --> 48:52.480]  know. It's a mystery. And Apple could say, no, we know, and you can follow our lead. This is how
[48:52.480 --> 48:58.000]  much it'll cost you to do this. Yeah. So then the last part of the Lisa Jackson's part of the show
[48:58.000 --> 49:04.720]  was the introduction of Liam, the iPhone deconstructing robot, um, which was kind of a
[49:04.720 --> 49:12.000]  surprise. I mean, because Apple doesn't really show you a bunch behind the, you know, behind the stage
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.800]  ever. Right. And it's sort of an interesting thing. My, and I wrote about it, like my thing is
[49:18.800 --> 49:24.240]  I can't help but wonder if they're same people working on Liam, the deconstructing robot are
[49:24.240 --> 49:32.480]  also working on, um, a sibling robot who puts phones together. Um, cause I, before we ever
[49:32.480 --> 49:38.880]  got a look at the, you know, and Apple started publishing photos of, you know, like the inside
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.920]  of the Fox con factories or assembly lines, I guess is a better way to put it. You know,
[49:43.920 --> 49:47.360]  like when Tim Cook started going there and there were photo ops and you could see it,
[49:47.360 --> 49:52.960]  it, I shouldn't have been surprised, but like my gut feeling was that I thought it would be a lot
[49:52.960 --> 49:57.520]  more automated. And because there are things, you know, like, like when you see like a car factory,
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.400]  an auto, an auto factory, a lot of it is roboticized. Whereas putting these electronics
[50:02.400 --> 50:10.960]  together is largely a re at least today is largely a manual job. Yeah. I wonder, um, and I don't know
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.120]  whether that's something that does Apple do that or does Apple talk to their manufacturers about
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.360]  doing that? Does Apple re, you know, work with them and say, we want to reinvent how this,
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.880]  you know, how this goes on. Um, so that the people working in the factories are supervising
[50:24.880 --> 50:28.640]  the robots rather than doing all the work themselves. Um, that would certainly reduce
[50:28.640 --> 50:31.600]  the number of people working in the factories, which is certainly how the auto industry in the
[50:31.600 --> 50:37.920]  United States, um, had problems, uh, because you lost a lot of jobs that way. But I don't know,
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.400]  it's, it would be, it's fascinating to me. Cause this is like, this is a people think people have
[50:42.400 --> 50:46.080]  talked about the problems of recycling electronics for a long time, but I felt like there was never
[50:46.080 --> 50:50.240]  a drum beat on it. Like there was about some other stuff, but this is definitely, you know,
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.440]  this seems to be almost in the same class as some of the other tech that we know exists back in the
[50:55.440 --> 51:00.320]  back of the Apple store where it's like, it's an Apple's benefit to have a recycling program and
[51:00.320 --> 51:06.080]  they refurbish phones and they didn't disassemble the parts and reuse them. And, um, how much of
[51:06.080 --> 51:12.160]  this is about being friendly to the earth and how much of this is about, uh, like it good business
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.040]  sense to why not? Why don't we reclaim all of these things and, and put them back to use? I
[51:17.040 --> 51:21.280]  don't know. It would be an interesting, who, who builds that? Who builds Liam? Do you get a job as
[51:21.280 --> 51:26.000]  a, uh, an engineer at Apple and then discover that rather than building like the new iPhone,
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.680]  you're building a device to take apart iPhone fives? Yeah, maybe. I guess so. I can't help
[51:31.680 --> 51:35.600]  it. Think that it was, that it's an Apple design machine. Yeah. Well, they said it's in California,
[51:35.600 --> 51:42.640]  so I assume so. Yeah. Um, pretty cool stuff. And then they gave a Mashable, like a nice
[51:42.640 --> 51:52.240]  behind the scenes look at it, which is another sign of the modern, uh, new Apple. Um, I also,
[51:52.240 --> 51:56.560]  before, I guess before we move on the other thing too, and Tim Cook, even, I guess he mentioned it
[51:56.560 --> 52:00.400]  at the end, but that it's, you know, if everything goes according to schedule, this will be, that
[52:00.400 --> 52:05.680]  will be, that was the last event they're going to hold on campus. Right. Um, on that, on that campus,
[52:06.320 --> 52:13.680]  on that campus. Right. Um, uh, and, uh, a couple of people, and I guess it's just, I, I overlook
[52:13.680 --> 52:17.760]  how some of the things that I find obvious, but other people don't, but a couple of readers were
[52:17.760 --> 52:22.880]  like, did he just say that they're not going to release anything new this year? And the answer is
[52:22.880 --> 52:27.200]  no, no, no, no, no. That's not the point. It's the schedule that Apple has been on the pattern
[52:27.200 --> 52:32.800]  that they've kind of centered on is really sort of a three public event, a year schedule,
[52:32.800 --> 52:38.640]  something in March, which is what we just had, um, of varying, you know, importance, depending
[52:38.640 --> 52:45.120]  on whether they have something majorly new to announce or not, uh, WWDC in middle of June,
[52:45.120 --> 52:50.160]  um, which is probably mostly software based, but maybe that's what they'll hold the new Mac books
[52:50.160 --> 52:54.080]  for. I don't know. I mean, I don't know if they'll either release these new Mac books, like with a
[52:54.080 --> 52:59.520]  press release between now and WWDC or hold them until WWDC. But that's my guess is that they'll,
[52:59.520 --> 53:02.560]  a bunch of us will get a call saying, would you like to come for a briefing? And they'll say,
[53:02.560 --> 53:06.240]  we have new Mac books and here's the go and the press release will go out and that'll be like
[53:06.240 --> 53:11.520]  at the end of April or something like that. Yeah. Um, and then in September there will certainly be
[53:11.520 --> 53:14.880]  a major event, but they don't, it's because it's a major event. They're not going to hold it in
[53:14.880 --> 53:20.160]  their tiny little town hall. They're going to hold it like last year at the bill Graham auditorium
[53:20.160 --> 53:25.280]  or the Flint center the year before that, or, you know, or Yerba Buena or Moscone West sometimes,
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.640]  but they'll find a big venue somewhere for that huge. I don't think they've ever done
[53:28.640 --> 53:35.280]  Moscone West other than for Mac world or WWDC. I think they did. I think I'm sure somebody out
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.920]  there is screaming at their car right now that they did. My memory is that they have done a
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.920]  single freestanding Moscone West event, but it's probably that is booked up. I think it,
[53:45.920 --> 53:49.280]  maybe it was just luck that there was some week where it wasn't booked, where they could just
[53:49.280 --> 53:52.880]  drop in and do it. But, and they also can't just do it for a day, right? Because we know Apple,
[53:52.880 --> 53:57.440]  they, they have days of prep to get the space exactly the way they want it. So they can't just
[53:57.440 --> 54:02.960]  rent it for a day. Right. I think I have my gut feeling is that that Yerba Buena is a thing in
[54:02.960 --> 54:08.480]  the past again, because of size. Yeah. If they're, if they were 50, it's not that much bigger than
[54:08.480 --> 54:15.840]  town hall. Yeah. It's, and it's, and it's a lot of, um, custom prep work to get the hands-on area.
[54:15.840 --> 54:19.440]  Yeah. They built that whole, they built a whole new hands-on
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.200]  thing. The last time they were at Yerba Buena, the last time they did the Yerba Buena,
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.000]  they actually cut a hole in the wall. They actually took a wall out and I remember asking,
[54:28.640 --> 54:34.000]  uh, that's Apple. Yeah. Well, I built, they built buildings essentially at, uh,
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.960]  at Bill Graham and, uh, at the Flint center. I think Katie Cotton was still there at the time.
[54:38.960 --> 54:43.440]  And I, and I spoke to somebody there, like towards the end, like as they were getting ready to kick
[54:43.440 --> 54:46.960]  us out of the hands-on area. And I was like, this is like insanely expensive because you
[54:46.960 --> 54:51.680]  guys have to like rebuild the wall. And she was like, yeah, we don't care. Yeah, that's about
[54:51.680 --> 54:57.200]  right. Uh, let me take another break here before we move on into the next segment of Apple's event
[54:57.200 --> 55:01.040]  and thank our good friends, another longtime sponsor of the show. You guys know them
[55:01.040 --> 55:09.440]  Squarespace. Squarespace is, uh, it's the all in one place to host design, customize,
[55:09.440 --> 55:17.040]  um, and build your own website. Uh, any kind of website, almost any website you could even imagine
[55:17.040 --> 55:23.200]  that you might want to start, you really ought to look at Squarespace first, go to squarespace.com.
[55:23.840 --> 55:31.280]  Um, and, uh, just cannot emphasize enough stuff like podcasts. You can host a podcast at
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.040]  Squarespace. They even have like a custom audio player. They, they know what podcast is. They
[55:35.040 --> 55:40.400]  can help you with that. You can post a blog, you have a store, you can, you can build your own
[55:40.400 --> 55:44.880]  store there and they have all of the shopping stuff, all the SSL stuff, all the credit card
[55:44.880 --> 55:50.640]  taking stuff. Uh, all of it is built in and you just do it when you're customizing it.
[55:51.440 --> 55:57.360]  It is like using a design app. It is not like sitting there and doing code or, you know,
[55:57.360 --> 56:00.800]  moving little snippets of code around, although you can get into the code if you want to,
[56:00.800 --> 56:08.000]  but you literally just drag stuff around and it's exactly how web design should be. You just sit
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.120]  there and you're, you're actually manipulating the actual website itself that you're logged into.
[56:13.120 --> 56:17.120]  It's not like there's an editing interface and a regular interface when you're signed in and you,
[56:17.120 --> 56:22.560]  it's your Squarespace account. You just sit there and you manipulate it in true. What you see is
[56:22.560 --> 56:27.600]  what you get style because it's actually what you're moving is the actual website. Um,
[56:27.600 --> 56:33.280]  really just can't emphasize enough how easy that is. So my thanks to Squarespace. Go to
[56:33.280 --> 56:41.520]  squarespace.com and use the code Gruber, my last name Gruber, and you will save 10% off
[56:41.520 --> 56:49.680]  your first order. Squarespace.com offer code Gruber. So use that code and, uh, you'll,
[56:49.680 --> 56:53.280]  they'll know you came from, uh, from the show. My thanks to Squarespace. If you have any kind
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.920]  of website that you may want to build, go there first and try it and you'll, you'll probably not
[56:57.920 --> 57:05.120]  even move on to anything else. My thanks to Squarespace. Uh, so then Jeff Williams comes
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.760]  out and like I was sitting next to Matthew Panzorino in the audience and when, when Jeff
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.400]  Williams was done and he was like, let me hand this off, you know, hand it back to Tim. I was like,
[57:14.400 --> 57:20.480]  I just whispered to Matthew. I was like, let me hand things off to my brother Tim. It's uncanny
[57:20.480 --> 57:28.080]  how similar Jeff Williams and Tim Cook's onstage demeanor is. It, it, I can't believe more people
[57:28.080 --> 57:33.920]  don't, don't comment on it. Yeah, they, they, they seem similar. They're, they're, Tim is
[57:33.920 --> 57:38.720]  more polished, but Tim's had more time to be more polished. Yeah, but Jeff Williams is sort of like
[57:38.720 --> 57:44.400]  where, where Tim Cook was when Tim was the COO for Steve Jobs and would occasionally come out
[57:44.400 --> 57:48.160]  on stage to talk about like how well the Mac is doing or something like that. Yeah. You know,
[57:48.160 --> 57:53.040]  one of the things we did, so, you know, going into the town hall event, um, I had that realization
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.040]  like Friday, that it's probably the last one. And I w I went to Stephen Hackett and I said,
[57:57.040 --> 58:00.560]  would you be interested in working with me on a piece, like looking back at town hall? And we,
[58:00.560 --> 58:06.240]  and we, and he, he replied with a list of YouTube videos of every town hall events since 2001.
[58:06.240 --> 58:11.520]  That's Stephen Hackett in a nutshell. Um, that's crazy. And I was looking at him and it was a fun
[58:11.520 --> 58:14.720]  story to put together. We sort of split the work. I've been to all of them. So I had like little
[58:14.720 --> 58:19.520]  tidbits, like when they took us upstairs to the dorm room, the fake dorm room for the iPod Hi-Fi.
[58:19.520 --> 58:24.560]  And I wasn't there for that. Oh no, that was so, that was, that was so weird. Um, and there,
[58:24.560 --> 58:27.920]  there were some others like that that were, where I remember, and the original iPod event,
[58:27.920 --> 58:33.840]  I remember going for that. But, um, uh, one of the funny things is that the ex-serve event,
[58:33.840 --> 58:42.320]  which was in May, 2002 has like super early Tim Cook. And it's interesting to see how far we've
[58:42.320 --> 58:48.000]  come since early Tim Cook, who was explaining the sales strategy of the ex-serve. He's come a long
[58:48.000 --> 58:53.920]  way in the, in the intervening 14 years. Yeah, he's really, it's, it's, it, it, that the
[58:53.920 --> 58:57.840]  comparison to Jeff Williams is interesting because they, they're, it's just funny to me how similar
[58:57.840 --> 59:03.280]  they are, how much it would be so easily to believe that they were brothers. Um, but it's
[59:03.280 --> 59:06.800]  also an interesting contrast in terms, like you said, like how much more polished Tim Cook has
[59:06.800 --> 59:12.640]  gotten and how, how really good he's gotten on stage. And I think he's, I think he's relaxed a
[59:12.640 --> 59:16.960]  little bit. I think he realizes he doesn't need to be Steve Jobs. Right. Which is like, and I don't
[59:16.960 --> 59:20.560]  mean that in a, Oh yeah, you gotta fill his shoes, but more like Steve set the template. Like you
[59:20.560 --> 59:24.480]  said, these Apple events, Apple knows what it's doing. I wrote a piece on Mac world a couple of
[59:24.480 --> 59:30.080]  weeks ago about how everybody does an Apple event now, like Apple defined this corporate tech media
[59:30.080 --> 59:35.760]  event thing. But, uh, if Steve's the template, then, then even if Steve's gone, there is a
[59:35.760 --> 59:40.160]  moment where you struggle of like, how do I, how do I do this? What's my way of doing it instead of
[59:40.160 --> 59:45.600]  sort of just reading Steve's lines for him. Um, and I feel like Tim Cook has gotten there now
[59:45.600 --> 59:50.560]  where it's, it's, it's an Apple event and it's always going to be, have the echoes of the Steve
[59:50.560 --> 59:56.240]  Jobs events, but he just seems more comfortable in his own skin on stage. He smiles a lot more.
[59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.200]  Um, that's the thing I kept taking pictures cause I, I do that at these Apple events and, um, you
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.640]  know, he used to be kind of serious and he would occasionally have like a super awkward grin that
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.200]  he'd be like, smile for the camera. And he, he just seems to, I mean, whether he's not like he
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.960]  could be completely, uh, torn up inside and terrified for all I know, but on stage he's
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.880]  projecting what seems like completely legitimate happiness about being up there. And so I do feel
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:30.560]  like he's kind of completely, uh, embraced his role now and knows what he knows who he is on stage
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.680]  and what his public persona is and has, has, uh, come to terms with it because he, yeah, I think
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.200]  he's come, he's never, he's going to be Tim Cook. He's never going to be anything but that, but he
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.320]  does feel like he's genuinely Tim Cook now. Yeah. And I, I couldn't say it better myself. And I
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.920]  think that it's, it doesn't matter how naturally talented you are at anything. You kind of have to
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.680]  do it for a little before you settle into it. Sure. Right. It's like, you know, I, I, I knew
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.840]  how to write when I started during fireball, but if you read the first few entries, you know,
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.080]  first year or two of during fireball, there's a certain tone that's not, it's not poorly written,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:11.680]  but it's not, it's not right. You know, or when you look at the first few years of like any of
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.840]  your favorite comic strips, like peanuts or even Calvin and Hobbes, it's like, they're not, the
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.720]  characters aren't quite drawn. Right. Yeah. Oh yeah, sure. They're, they're all off, off model.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.840]  I remember when I was a kid reading the Garfield books and you start with book one and you're like,
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:28.000]  what the hell is this? This is not Garfield. Right. It looks like a parody of Garfield or
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.280]  something. That's it. And then it settles in, you know, and then the natural, you know, it's,
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.840]  and I feel like, you know, Tim Cook's onstage persona is exactly like that. And he has settled
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.160]  in like saying that he's more comfortable or he's just more himself is exactly it.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.000]  And I used to say, like before when, when Steve Jobs was still around, but you know, when it,
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.080]  you know, for obvious reasons, it was people were, we were all speculating about what would happen
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:00.720]  post Steve Jobs. And I used to say, and I guess it's still true in theory that it's not necessarily,
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.480]  it doesn't have to be the case that the CEO of Apple is the, the spokesman for the company.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.880]  And that, you know, Tim Cook could just be the CEO and Phil Schiller could run the events. And in a
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.640]  way I was, I think I was right in a way I was wrong where I was right in so far as that Tim Cook
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.600]  almost never sells, sells the new products. He always hands off to somebody to actually
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.560]  pitch the products, which is obviously what, you know, Steve Jobs just did it all himself.
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.080]  But I do kind of feel like it's important that he's sort of the host of the show.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  There is a certain, look, the buck stops here. Right. This is my, this is my company. This is
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.880]  why we're doing what we're doing. I thought there would be less of him, honestly. I thought he would
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.680]  do that thing where he'd come up at the beginning and give the, you know, retail update, all that
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.000]  stuff that they didn't even do in this, but that's like the company's business and then hand it off.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.240]  And he did this for, I think at least one event handed off, essentially not come back until the
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.320]  end and come back on stage and say, see, this is why we do what we do. Only Apple can do this.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.000]  Thanks for being here. Goodbye. And that would be it. But his presence is, he's much more like the
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.080]  glue that holds the thing together than I thought he had. And I don't think he needed, he could have
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.640]  had Phil Schiller do that. Right. But he hasn't, and he's done a good job at it. Yeah. It's a
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.440]  little bit more like the host of the Oscars. Exactly. Where there certainly are, you know,
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.320]  a lot of the Oscar show is you're some, you know, famous actor comes out to give the award for
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.720]  whatever. So it's not like the host does it all, but the host does glue every segment together.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.320]  And I exactly, I feel exactly like you did. I did not think we'd see as much of Tim Cook at events
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:43.200]  like this as we do, but it's, you know, it's all good. Yeah. Jeff Williams, Care Kit. Sounds like
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:50.240]  a big deal. I don't know what to make of it though. You know, like it's, I'm not quite sure
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:55.120]  how that's going to work. I mean, it's just so far outside of the mainstream. I think, I think the
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.440]  answer is going to be that in a year, we're going to hear, like we did about some of the health
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.560]  stuff in, in a year and the research kit stuff we'll hear, Oh, well, this is how Care Kit is
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:10.000]  being used to help patients. But, um, beyond that, I mean, it's, it, unless you're, what I,
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.880]  what I hope is that we'll see something from somebody who covers like healthcare and, uh,
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.960]  and, and research and, and medical stuff, write a story or write stories about what's going on
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.680]  here with this, because it's their area of expertise way more than it is, than it is ours.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:32.080]  I mean, I, I know some doctors and I've talked to them about Apple stuff and they say, well,
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.720]  it looks cool, but unless you know somebody who's actually doing a research project that is using
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.000]  this tech, um, it's harder to get a, get a sense of, of what's going on. I think it's great that
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.320]  they're doing it. I, I think this comes back to those corporate values again, where Apple looks
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.240]  at these devices and says, we're making these devices and putting them in people's pockets
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:55.280]  and it can change their lives. Who's gonna, you know, who's gonna make the tools that make the,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.640]  the medical industry capable of doing this. It should be us. We're the platform owner. We should
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.440]  do this. And I, I, I think it's good that they're, that they're doing that, but I don't know how to
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:10.160]  judge it. Yeah. I thought it was pretty interesting because it just have a little bit of firsthand
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:16.160]  experience in the last few years, uh, with surgery that the, the, the, the thing he said, like you,
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:22.080]  you in the hospital and you have the best people possible who do this all day, every day and have
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.240]  up to the minute knowledge dealing with every aspect of you, you know, everything you're
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.880]  hooked up to, every way you're monitored, the timing of everything is all taken care of by
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.880]  truly expert professionals. And then when they're discharged, they give you this and it's just like
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.480]  a sheet of paper. And it's, it's so funny. It was like not an exaggeration. Like when my finger,
[01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.640]  my eye, every, every little surgery I've had in the last few years, uh, that is,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.000]  that's how they discharge you. They give you like a piece of paper and I do read them and I followed
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.280]  the instructions like religiously because I, you know, I want these, you know, I wanted my finger
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.360]  to actually work again. I would, you know, I was hoping that I would be able to see out of my left
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:04.640]  eye again, but I can totally understand though how like a lot of people don't for whatever reason,
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:10.560]  you know, that they just don't think it's important or, or whatever. Um, I wonder how much
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.880]  better putting it in, you know, getting it into your phone will be, I can see how it might be a
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:20.240]  lot better if you can get like, if you can automate the, Hey, you know, you know, just like getting a
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.320]  text message, you get an alert like without you having to manually set the alarm. If you could
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.480]  just get the alert that says it's time to, you know, take one of your pills or check your blood
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.440]  pressure or your, your, or your, uh, you know, anything like that, your blood oxygen count or
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:40.480]  whatever it is that they're, that they're looking for. Yeah. And, and I mean, that's the, it's a
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.360]  little bit like all the fitness stuff, right? This is the flip side of the fitness stuff.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.680]  Yes. That's a, that's, I think that's exactly the model. Yeah. Cause it's still, it's still,
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.560]  you know, logging and motivation of personal data. And the difference here is that somebody
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:57.520]  is monitoring it for you because they're concerned about your, you know, specific health issues rather
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.600]  than it just being sort of you saying how much, how many steps did I do? How much did I run today?
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.600]  Right. Or, you know, but now if it's, you know, like a surgery, like I had on my finger or
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:09.760]  somebody else might have on their knee or hip or something like that, you know, not just stand up,
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.720]  it's time to do these stretching exercises. Oh, I would totally, I did some physical therapy and
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.920]  I totally, um, this is the podcast where old men talk about injuries. Um, I did some physical
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.520]  therapy on my shoulder and it was, um, always a challenge for me when I came back because
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.360]  they had a whole regimen down and they gave me like the sheet of paper with some exercises
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.080]  circled in this, like really bad illustrations. And I, and I had done the exercises and I was
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:38.800]  like, how do I do that again? And it sort of fell apart very quickly. And I did have that thought
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:45.040]  of like, um, you know, would it be, would it have been better if I had sat down with some app and
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:52.560]  put in like a series of reminders or calendar events or something to get me to do this?
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:56.640]  And the answer is probably yes, but, and that was my failure is that I just sort of like took the
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.000]  piece of paper and figured I'd get to it and I never did. Yeah. I also think, and I think it's,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.320]  you know, we, we mentioned this earlier on the show, this whole endeavor by Apple with research
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:15.120]  kit and care kit, um, isn't really selling phones. Right. It's, it really is a, you know,
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:23.680]  and as much as we can bitch about Apple, um, jealously guarding its margins by still selling
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:29.760]  16 gigabyte devices instead of starting everything at 32. Um, here's an area, these areas like the
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.480]  environment and health kit and, uh, well, maybe not health kit, but, but research kit and care
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:41.040]  kit for sure. Aren't really about selling, you know, devices. I really do think it's,
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.640]  it is an institutional, this is the right thing to do. We're in a position to do this
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.160]  and we should do it. We're making the world a better place. Right. And I think, I think
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:51.840]  it's almost like it's incumbent on us because we've got a popular platform. I don't know if
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.080]  Google has similar initiatives. I kind of hope they do because it's, as a platform owner, you
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.360]  kind of need to be the one to say, yeah, we're going to make this easier for these industries
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.440]  to work on our platform. I think, and I think that it's the exact sort of thing that Google would do
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.440]  too. It does seem like the sort of, you know, that, that without any sort of cynicism at all,
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.520]  that it's, you know, it is the sort of thing that Google would want to do. I mean, you,
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.400]  you're responsible for this. Uh, these devices that are on everybody's bodies, uh, they, they
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.240]  can make a huge impact, but they probably need a push because the industry is not monolithic enough
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.480]  probably to create an initiative to do it, but you're the platform owner, you could do it. And
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.120]  then you, you could help them. And there, there are eventual benefits, I think, from, in terms
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.520]  of sales, like if you've got a healthcare professionals and the healthcare industry,
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.360]  really happy about how Apple listens to them and does all of this, maybe in the end, they are more
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:50.720]  inclined to buy iPads or whatever, but it's super indirect. I, it's not like research kit is going
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:56.880]  to, you know, sell thousands of iPhones. I think you're right about that. Yeah. Um, so then Tim
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:03.200]  Cook came back on stage, um, and talked about Apple watch and, and this is a perfect example
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.840]  of the sort of thing that years ago I would not have expected Tim Cook to handle was that it was
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:14.320]  Tim Cook who introduced the new, and again, it's not blockbuster news, but new, new watch straps
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:22.400]  across the line. Um, our, our, uh, what did he say? Our spring colors. Yeah. Well, I think,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:30.400]  you know, I it's, it's not just gently tweaked. I definitely see this as some kind of strategic move
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.040]  on Apple's part that they really are like every six months going to, you know, I fully expect in
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.240]  September to, you know, probably new watch hardware in September. We can talk about that
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:47.120]  in a moment too, but you know, new bands too. Um, a couple of things. One thing is that they
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:52.880]  reduced the price, the starting price for this, the sport models drop 50 bucks. Um,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.440]  so now it's a two 99 starting price for the 38 millimeter sport. I didn't check even did,
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.560]  did the, did the bigger sport model also drop 50 bucks? Oh, I didn't check either. I think so.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:09.040]  I think the sport sport dropped 50. I think that was the story is sport drop 50. I saw somebody on
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.120]  Twitter said, why didn't they drop the addition? I think they were joking. I was like, oh, that's
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:21.360]  good. Yeah. Um, but you know, you want to lower entry cost. Uh, and you know, I got into it on a
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.160]  post, a brief post on during fireball day where somebody, otherwise an article about something
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.400]  else just offhandedly mentioned that it's, it seems like it's a sign that the watch is selling
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:35.200]  lower than expected because they dropped the price. And I don't think that that's necessarily
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.800]  true at all. I think that the watch is, it could be, but I don't think you should draw
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.440]  that conclusion. I think because it was announced, it's been out for a year, but it was announced 18
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:51.360]  months ago. Um, yeah, that in 18 months, the idea that they could man, you know, cut the price by
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.480]  50 bucks and keep the margin around the same is a very Apple like thing to do. And then on Twitter,
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.400]  some people called me out and said, well, when Apple never drops the price of anything, you look,
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:07.120]  Mac books are all still eight 99 and nine 99. Um, and it's true for certain products. They,
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.720]  they kind of try to keep a price and keep it there. But on others like, and I would compare
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.880]  that especially the sport watch, I would compare to the iPod in terms of what kind of product it
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.600]  means it is to Apple. And you know, the price points are similar and the iPods regularly
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.560]  dropped in price or at least the starting price of an iPod dropped by like 50 bucks or so pretty
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:36.000]  steadily year after year after year until they got it down to, you know, uh, you know, $50, uh,
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:43.280]  ones that you have attached to your jacket. Right. So I see that as something that I, I think,
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.080]  you know, that we'll see, you know, eventually, you know, maybe a year or two from now that the
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.320]  starting price will go to one 99. And I don't know, I don't know what the bottom is, but it's
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.840]  probably like one 49 or something like that. I think you're right. I think if you look at
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.200]  the price, if you look at the price, when it came out, you would have to say, is it Apple's intent
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.840]  that the Apple watch to get into an Apple watch will always be three 49 or 400 bucks or something
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.560]  like that. Is that, is it really their long-term plan that this will always be a $400 product?
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:18.080]  No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. That's too expensive. It is, it's a first-generation
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.760]  product. That's what they have to sell it at, but in the long run, it's gotta be cheaper than that.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.640]  Right. There's to start at least it has to be. So I think that's part of it. I think, yeah,
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.640]  there it's a, it's a product that's been out there a long time. They want to, they want more people
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.600]  in the Apple watch world. Right. So you lower the price a little bit. You've got margin to give now.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.080]  I think it, I think it's fine. I do think that if they were selling every single one that they
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.880]  could make and then were supply constrained, they wouldn't lower the price. But, um, you know,
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.880]  obviously not at that part of the cycle. Right. But I think you're right. If, if Apple could make
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.080]  an Apple watch, ultimately make an Apple watch with good margins for 150 bucks, they would,
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.800]  they would prefer to do that because this is an iPhone accessory. I think they would rather have
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.680]  the volume go up. And then again, keeping in mind, even if you sold it at 150 bucks,
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:08.000]  you got watch bands, and then you've got your fancier models that are always going to be there
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.800]  and always going to be enticing people on the, uh, to spend more money. I was talking to, um,
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.600]  Mike Hurley on our, uh, our podcast and he, he listed off all the, um, watch bands that he's
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.400]  bought. And it's like, he has spent as much on watch bands for the Apple watch as he spent on
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.200]  the Apple watch. Right. I mean, that was an interesting number from Tim on stage. It was
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:31.200]  something that they, to my knowledge had never revealed before. He said one third of their Apple
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.240]  watch customers regularly change bands. Yeah. And I'm in there. I've got like, I've got like
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:41.920]  three and I definitely cycle between them and it's kind of fun to not, it makes it a little
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:48.160]  bit different, uh, for a few weeks. And then I switched back. Yeah, I got, uh, Apple gave me a,
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:58.320]  uh, uh, the, the new space black one with Milanese as to review, um, uh, which is nice. I'd, uh, I
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.760]  like it more than I, I I've worn it a couple of days this week. Um, I kind of don't like it
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.080]  though. It's for exactly the reason that I thought, which is that I, I kind of wear my watch
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:14.080]  out at the hinge of my wrist. And so it's sort of like when I flex my wrist, it, it puts a little
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.920]  stress on the band and the Milanese slips a little tiny bit as the way I wear it. I feel like, like
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.040]  I, I would need to wear it a little bit higher on my wrist to keep it snug. Um, but I also got
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.560]  the nylon band and I liked that a lot. The nylon, the new nylon strap. Yeah. They, they, um, there
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:35.440]  was a rumor that they were going to do like full on like NATO straps and it's, it's very, um, I was
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.240]  struck by something that Marco Arment said on, on ATP the other week, which is, and he's, he's kind
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.080]  of like abandoned the Apple watch and is gone to mechanical watches and all that. Oh, he's off the
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.280]  deep end. He's he's yeah. Oh, he it's Marco. He doesn't do anything halfway. Right. Um, but,
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.920]  but what struck me about, about somebody who's not into the Apple watch anymore has moved on
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.680]  said, and has done like real watches said, said Apple's bands are like second to none. Apple
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.200]  really, really owns the, the, the watch band game. And I agree with that. I think their bands are
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:08.240]  really great. I bought this Kickstarter thing that let's you use any watch band with, uh, it's got
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.040]  just a couple of lugs for the Apple watch. And I put this black leather band that I had on them
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:17.680]  and it's terrible. Like in, in context compared to the Apple leather band, it's just not even close.
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:24.000]  And so that NATO strap rumor was interesting. And it is, is it surprising at all that in,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.360]  in the end, what Apple did to say, we've got something that's kind of like that, but it's
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:33.440]  way better. And then that's what the, this woven stuff is. It's like Apple's take on the genre of
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.800]  NATO strap, but not, uh, not the same. Yeah. And it's funny too, because the one thing with
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:46.480]  the NATO strap is, um, uh, the real NATO straps go underneath the watch. It's like one continuous
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.280]  nylon that goes through the lug under the back so that the actual back of the watch doesn't
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:58.160]  touch your wrist. That's it sits on top of the strap. Um, and I remember I listened to the ATPX
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.240]  episode and Syracuse was confused as to why that is. There actually is like a tactical reason for
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:10.240]  the design of the strap. The idea is that if one of the bars of your watch that holds a strap,
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:16.560]  if one of them breaks while you're like in combat, because it's just one strap that goes through,
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.720]  if one of the bars breaks, the watch won't come off your wrist. It'll, it'll be flopping around
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:26.880]  because there's one bar broken, but the, the, you know, the rest of the strap will be going through
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:32.080]  the other bar. Right. Cause you've essentially tied a strap to your wrist. Right. Um, there's
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:39.600]  super, they're super, super valuable. Um, I mean, I think that they regularly sell for like $50,000
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:45.280]  or more, but there's, um, some vintage Rolexes that they made for the British military in the
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:53.920]  late sixties and early seventies. Um, and that they only could use a NATO strap because the,
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:59.120]  by the specs of the British military, the crossbars in the watch, the thing that you'd
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:03.520]  need, like, you know, in a normal watch, you need like a special tool to like, you know,
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.520]  it's called a spring bar. So you compress it a little bit. So it pops out. So you can change
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.680]  the strap. Those bars were, um, like welded or whatever you would call it. You know, they, they,
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.960]  they weren't springy. They were like part of the actual watch so that they'd be leaving less likely
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:22.640]  to break. So there is a tactical reason for that, but that design wouldn't work at all with the
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.760]  Apple watch because the strap would actually cover the sensors. Exactly. So they had to, uh,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.840]  do their own thing, their little appley spin on it. Right. I find it to be a very comfortable
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:37.120]  material though. I have a strap like that on an old, uh, uh, regular watch that I have a similar,
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.200]  it's not really a NATO style. I actually, cause I don't like the, I don't like the way that it sits
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.800]  on your wrist when it goes through like that, but it's NATO style and has, it just attaches to
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.960]  spring bars like a regular watch. But I find that nylon is actually a super comfortable material,
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:56.160]  uh, especially like in hot weather. Yeah. And they look better. I've heard some people say
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.760]  that they thought they looked kind of ugly on the, uh, on the Apple website. They look
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.400]  way better in person. Yeah. They're actually very hard to photograph. I think that it's almost like
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:08.800]  you get a little more a pattern on them because they are, they are the super patterned woven,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.840]  uh, you know, multiple color, uh, woven fabric. So they're hard to, they're hard to picture.
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:18.880]  Yeah. I'm looking at it right now on Apple's website and by putting them at any kind of angle,
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:24.560]  even on a retina, my retina display here, it's, it, it, they're, it's, it's not a good pattern on
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:32.080]  it. It looks weird, but in person, they look nice. Um, but no major or shaking news on Apple watch,
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:37.440]  which was exactly what we expected. Right. So do you think, well, we talked about this in person
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:44.400]  after the event, you think that they have to do, I kind of think they do have to do Apple watch 2.0
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.960]  in September. I think, I think they need to do a refresh. September will be two years since it was
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.920]  announced, uh, if not shipped. Um, and so it's hard to say that the hardware is two years old
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.680]  because the hardware didn't exist when it was announced. Right. It was, they were still working
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.400]  on it and then they got it out six months later, but I feel like they do need to do a refresh at
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.440]  the same time. I wonder what is an Apple watch refresh look like and is it, you know, they've
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:13.280]  got so much work I think to do on the software side still too, that is it, is it like. I would
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.760]  like to see it be subtle. I'd like it to see it be like, yes, there's a new model, but it looks like
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:22.080]  the old model more or less and all the bands work with it. It behaves more or less the same. Maybe
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.840]  it's more energy efficient. It lasts longer. It's it's, it's more, it's faster, whatever, but it's
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:33.200]  sort of like still Apple watch almost not like a stealth replacement. Apple watch two is completely
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.160]  new, but more like now, you know, here's the new model of Apple watch. It's, it's a little bit
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.680]  better. Um, and, and like leave it at that. Cause I, I, I feel like what they really don't want to
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:50.320]  do is give the, um, the, the impression that every two years, there's going to be a completely
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.200]  different Apple watch and all of your old stuff is going to be gone. Um, I, I think they all want,
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.760]  almost want to make it feel timeless. Like this is our design. It's going to look like this for
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:05.920]  a while. You, you know, you can get used to it, feel, feel good about buying one. Um, but we'll,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.240]  we'll see. I, I that's my hope is that it's, it's not like a, like a major phone announcement,
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:16.400]  but it's more like, yeah, the Apple watch is a little bit better now, but it's still the Apple
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.600]  watch. And especially on the hardware side, because, you know, I think the hardware is,
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:26.080]  is it can always be improved, but it's not the problem with the Apple watch. If I've got
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.440]  problems with the Apple watch, and we talked about this too, when we were in Cupertino,
[01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.000]  you know, I think it's more on the software, like after two years, um, of use or in a year and a
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.280]  half where the public is, is, is using it, they should have some better ideas about like
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.040]  assumptions they made two years ago that maybe aren't right. That they need to fix in software.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.440]  I think the hardware needs improvement too. I think that the thing is just too damn slow.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.840]  I really, it's hard to tell, right? Because is that the software, the hardware, it's gotta be
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.920]  the hardware. That's just the fact that it takes forever for apps to launch. And sometimes they
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.880]  don't well. And just for example, like I just went through it again because they, they let me
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:07.280]  have a review unit of the, the Milanese thing. So I paired it with the, it's, and it's the whole
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.680]  hassle. It's such a, it's the worst thing in the world to complain about because we, what a great
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:17.520]  job I have. This is great. I mean, so I don't want to complain. And then I, you know, Apple gives me
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.680]  these things to review and I get to play with this, all this stuff without having to buy it.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:29.360]  It's, it's great fun, but it, you know, but it's a pain in the ass. Like with the way that Apple
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:34.720]  watches paired to a phone, it's a pain in the ass to test a new phone because then you can't really
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.680]  fully test it unless you're also pairing it, you know, with your watch. If that's how you normally,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.200]  if you actually wear an Apple watch. And you, you know, it's such a pain in the ass to pair and
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.960]  unpair a watch, but just pairing the new watch that they, they gave me to review, I paired it
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.920]  with the iPhone SE. So I'm, I'm leaving my watch, my, the one I actually bought and owned, paired
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.200]  with the iPhone 6S that I bought and owned, and I'm using their review unit watch with the review
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:05.440]  unit phone. What a pain in the ass it is to set up a new Apple watch. It is, it takes forever.
[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.800]  Yeah. It's, um, and that's not just a reviewer's problem. Um, my wife had her, um, she had her
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.800]  iPhone screen break and got a replacement and the replacement digitizer was bad. So she took it back
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:24.320]  and they, and they replaced the whole unit. And you know what that means. She had to then re repair
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.680]  her Apple watch and restore it from the backup and it took forever and then it wasn't working right.
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:36.880]  And, and they said, um, wipe, wipe it and don't restore your backup and see if it's something
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:42.000]  weird involving your backup. So we wiped it and then we had to repair the Apple watch again. And
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.800]  it's another like hour to set that up. So there are real world scenarios where it's like, anytime
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.600]  you change anything about your phone, you have to go through that Apple watch process again.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:56.800]  Right. And I don't, and I think in the long run, they have to be aware of this cause inside Apple,
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.120]  they have to be, you know, they, they probably pair and unpair Apple watches more than anybody,
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.280]  you know, while they're testing betas and testing, you know, prototype new devices and stuff like
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:10.240]  that. So they have to be aware of that. But it's when you've gone through it and it's no longer
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.400]  novel. Like when you've, when it first came out and sure it took a long time, but you could like,
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.920]  you know, I was, you know, just studying what it does and watching the little spinner go around
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:24.640]  and it's like, oh, that's a clever thing. But now it's like, oh my God, this is ridiculous.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.080]  Yeah. Oh, I mean, it really can take like an hour. It's got you. So yeah, I mean the hardware,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:36.880]  I would imagine that, um, uh, a new Apple watch would not look that different. There's a rumor
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.800]  about putting a camera on it. I don't even know about that. Cause it's just going to take pictures
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:49.120]  up your nose, but ridiculous, but, but making the processor faster and more energy efficient
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:55.920]  so that the battery lasts longer. These are things that, um, I could see, right? That's to me,
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.800]  it feels like that's what the new Apple watch should be is like the old Apple watch, except,
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.080]  uh, faster and last longer. I can, the only thing I could think of using the camera for
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:10.960]  would not be FaceTime because again, the angle would be terrible and the, the, your arm would
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:18.080]  get tired within like 15 seconds. Yeah. Um, I, I could see it though, if they can do it,
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.520]  it would almost be to me the only time I would imagine using it. And I've, I've been in this
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:27.600]  situation, like when I'm out jogging and, and don't want to take my phone out of the pocket
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.520]  I have it in or whatever. If it's already, if I see something interesting, it would be interesting
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:37.200]  to just point my wrist at it and take a picture. But there'd be no, there's problems with that too,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.880]  right? Cause you don't, you wouldn't be able to look at the screen to do it. If you're pointing,
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.520]  just pointing your watch at something, if you can launch a camera app and it turns the, uh,
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.080]  like the bottom button into a shutter for a picture, you could get a picture, but you,
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:57.040]  you know, you're almost like shooting it blind. Yeah. I took some pictures of the Apple event
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:02.480]  without looking through the viewfinder of like low, low angles of Apple products in the hands-on
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.440]  area afterward. And they were all terrible because I couldn't frame them right. That's not going to
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.480]  be, yeah, I, I get the appeal of the Dick Tracy video watch kind of thing, but boy, that would not
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:17.600]  be where I would put my, that's not the thing that's crying out on the Apple watch, right?
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.000]  If only it had a camera in there, man, then we would really have something that is not what I,
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.760]  I think is going on with the Apple watch. Exactly. Um, so yeah, I do think though that the,
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:33.200]  the big news for the watch and hardware and software will all be in September. I think it
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:37.040]  would be a huge part of the September event. Yeah. I'd love to see if there was a,
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:43.920]  if they talk about watch iOS three, a lot at WWDC, if, if we get, if we get, maybe get a
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.040]  sense of that there. Right. I I'm, and I'm hoping, I'm really hoping that they rethink the whole
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.040]  thing because it feels like, and developers feel this way too, I think, which is, you know, the
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.880]  app model doesn't really work right. And it's confusing and people aren't using apps, uh, in
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.960]  large part on the, on the watch. When I talk to developers who have watch apps, their apps don't
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.760]  get used very much, and that would be a good time for them to communicate with developers is like,
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.320]  all right, we're going to make some changes to the watch iOS. We're going to make it simpler.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.200]  You know, this is how you're going to, your software is going to interact with it. It's
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:23.280]  going to be a little bit different. I would love to hear that at WWDC. Uh, we'll see if they,
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.320]  cause I feel like after two years, they got to look at it and go, Oh yeah, we, we probably,
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:33.760]  this whole complications and glances and apps from the app launcher screen and what we use the
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.040]  buttons for. It's like, we, we kind of got it wrong. Let's, let's clean this up and, and, and
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.840]  do a take two on it. Um, and I hope they do. I hope they don't, I hope they, uh, I think it
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.600]  would be hard for them not to notice that. I, and I hope they're like pride doesn't get in the way
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.200]  of like, no, no, no, no, no. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Uh, because I think
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.760]  this product could be a way better, even if all they did was change some of the things about the
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.920]  software. Yeah, I very much agree with that. I, we ever, my bottom line is that I think they made
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.640]  a big mistake by offering apps in the first place that maybe eventually they should have done it,
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:11.120]  but I think they should have bit the bullet and done what they did with the iPhone and wait at
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.920]  least a year before they open it up to apps. Um, just because the app experience is so poor,
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.160]  it's, it really would have been better to ship without it, even though it would have inevitably
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:29.760]  led to people screaming that they want apps only in theory. But I still think it just the actual
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.000]  just the actual experience of it and the way it's played out, I think bears that out. Like you said,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.480]  like developers even say, you know, we made the app and nobody uses it. Yeah. And, um, having,
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.240]  you know, your apps on your phone is phone accessory. Having your apps on your phone
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.880]  do things on the watch that are interesting. I like that idea. I think the complications thing
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:52.880]  is actually way more interesting. I think glances are actually a little bit more interesting. I'd
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:29:00.320]  almost rather glances be more powerful and not have apps. Yep. Yeah. I never want to go. I can't
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.920]  remember the last time that I wanted to and needed to go to the app screen. So the pressing one of
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.720]  the primary buttons on the thing, one press on the crown takes me to a place where I never want to go.
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:18.800]  Yep. Uh, so anyway, I'm with you. I knew hardware and I hope like an interesting conceptual
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.320]  rethink of the software. It would be, I didn't really think about the fact that they might do
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.920]  that. It's a WWDC. I kind of bet that they don't because I think that if they're going to do that,
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.840]  now that you mentioned it, I kind of think it could be a big tell as to whether they're going
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:39.920]  to rethink it or not. And I feel like if they talk about it at WWDC, it probably won't involve a major
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.040]  conceptual rethink of how the watchOS works. And if there are going to do it,
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:49.680]  I think they're going to save it for September so that they can add to the surprise of the event.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.960]  Or it'll be one of those half measures things where, you know, here are some new things you
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.840]  can do with watch apps and leaving aside that, Oh, well, we're actually going to change how you
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:02.880]  get to them and how it works, but you know, only tell the developers what they need to know to, to,
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.360]  to get their apps. I don't know. I feel like they need to evangelize with developers about
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.400]  watch apps because I feel like that was not only did the customers sort of get, um, let down by
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.680]  the apps, but the developers got let down by the apps. It was, uh, they're there. They had to change,
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.920]  you know, midstream. They had the watchOS 2 apps were different rules than the original watch apps.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:29.200]  And, and so I feel like, uh, yeah, if they want, if they want active app, uh, developers on the
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:35.120]  watch, they're going to have to tell them a story of some kind of WWDC. Yeah. Uh, and I think that,
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:40.480]  you know, the truth is that they burned a little bit of trust, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. You know,
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.600]  the message from Apple both publicly and privately, like we're talking to like developer relations,
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.680]  people was seriously, you know, you should do this. You should, you know, you should,
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:54.880]  you need a story to get on the watch, you know, get on the watch. And a lot of, you know, a lot
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.480]  of people listen to it and a lot of people did it. And I think a lot of people see it as effectively
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.560]  wasted effort or at least effort that might've been better allocated something else. Not that
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.480]  it was completely wasted, but that maybe the time would have been better spent, you know,
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:12.000]  making your iPad version of your app better as opposed to, and not just because of like how many
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.920]  people, it's not how many people have Apple watches. That's not the issue. The issue is
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:20.800]  people who have the Apple watches aren't using their watch apps because the app experience on
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:29.280]  the watch is bad. Right. Right. Um, that brings us to, uh, the iPhone SE and, uh, JAWS did it
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:34.320]  on stage. I guess we can just mix talking about the actual device with, with, with the event. Um,
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.160]  I thought he did a good job. I thought, you know, we haven't seen JAWS on stage in a while.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.960]  And yeah, I think he's really, he's a great presenter.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:46.720]  I think so too. I ran into him before the event. Uh, um, and I walked over from, um,
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:51.840]  from building one where we all came in over to building four with him and we were chatting.
[01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.840]  Cause he, he saw the town hall story that we did and, and thought that was, thought that was great.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.440]  And it turns out they had a slide about it at the end of the presentation. So we, we, people were
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:05.680]  like, ah, see, it's not just us. Um, which was cool. And I, I've known that guy for a long time
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:12.160]  because he used to be like the power book product manager. I mean, he goes back a long way at Apple
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:20.160]  and, uh, he, he is very good on stage. And one of those town hall events that we found, um, he like
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.640]  was the person who introed the event. He like got up on stage and said, good morning, everybody,
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:28.640]  welcome to this Apple event. I'm like, wow. Yeah. I remember that one.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:35.120]  I remember that one. I think it was like the iOS two or iOS three. Yeah. And it was like a March
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.440]  event where they were like announcing, I think maybe like iOS three. And I think it was the,
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:45.840]  it's the iPhone software 3.0 I think is what they called it. Right. And, uh, it was at a time,
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.760]  one of the times when Steve jobs was on a medical leave. Right. And it was a year after they had,
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:54.480]  they had launched the app store. Um, yeah. Yeah. So he's good. And it was great to see him on
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:00.400]  stage because I, I, I, I like him. I think he's a, I think he's a good guy and, uh, and I think
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:05.920]  he does a good job on stage. He's, he's always been sort of, you know, he works for, for Phil
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.880]  Schiller. So, um, he doesn't get necessarily as many opportunities to shine because Phil could
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.720]  have done that demo. Right. But, but instead Jaws did it. And I thought, uh, I thought it
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.440]  did a good job. Yeah. Um, and it's a tough, it's a tough pitch. Like I said, at the beginning of
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.600]  the show, it's, you know, here's a phone that everything about it is familiar in some way.
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:26.720]  It's just a new combination. And, you know, I thought he did a good job. And as somebody
[01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:31.920]  who's been looking forward to the idea of a four inch phone that please, please, please still has
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.840]  top of the line specs. Uh, I was really happy with the announcement, tons of speculation before
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:43.600]  the event that, that it was going to have like a, uh, underclocked a nine, if it does have an
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:49.840]  a nine that the camera would be some sort of lesser, uh, image quality compared to the success.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:56.640]  Uh, and both of those things turned out not to be true. Yeah. It's, um, it's funny. The,
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.880]  the, it makes sense to me, right? The rumors that like, oh, it's going to be a redesigned thing.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:10.160]  And, uh, you know, it's, it's, uh, and, and, well, I mean, what you said about the, the idea
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.880]  of it being a underclocked underclocked, I was pondering that because on one level,
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.600]  that doesn't that make sense? It's like, well, it's going to be the cheapest phone.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.120]  It should be kind of lesser. Right. And then as I was listening, I thought, okay,
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.800]  I see what they're doing here. They're doing a lot of what they did when they did the iPad Air 2,
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:29.680]  which is let's max it out now. And then we're going to just leave it there for a while because
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:35.600]  are they really going to do a new iPhone se every year? No, they're not. So pack it with the, the
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.120]  success stuff for the most part right now, pack that in. And I would call that this year's
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.840]  technology, but it's not this year's technology, right? It's it's last year's technology. It's in
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:51.280]  the current current models, but there will be new models in a few months. Um, so packet with last
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.520]  year's technology, but, uh, that will give you a couple, you know, two, three years where you
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.480]  don't have to update it. And then in two or three years, you turn it around again, maybe, and have
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.360]  it look perhaps even exactly the same as it does now again. But you, you know, at that point,
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.440]  you'll put in the specs from the iPhone seven S or whatever. Yeah. That's the, the it's like,
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.920]  I've been hoping for an iPhone four with, with these specs for so long. And now that I've got
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:20.560]  it, I'm instantly worried about the future. Sure. Right. Because you may not be able to,
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:25.440]  whatever amazing thing they announced this fall or even next fall, you know, may, may not come
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:34.000]  to that phone for two years or three years. That's very true now. So my thinking strategically
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.600]  is that they're definitely not going to do a four inch phone in September on the other one.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:46.400]  No, certainly not. I don't even think it'll be once a year. I don't think so either. Like,
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.400]  and I know, and that's a couple of people I've spoken to privately have been like,
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:56.240]  who are four inch fans, uh, were, you know, like, I think it's too much to ask that they
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.400]  are going to do an iPhone seven that comes in three sizes, uh, four, 4.7 and 5.5. Cause this,
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.800]  it's only six months after this event, right? Like they'll, so they'll go off cycle with events,
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.120]  but they almost never, the only one I can, the only example I can think of is when they, they,
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:17.920]  they've replaced the iPad three, six months after it came out. Right. Yeah. That was like the first
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.520]  retina iPad and it was so underpowered for them. They're like, nope, forget it. It was,
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.360]  it was like the, it's like the one iOS clunker device that they've shipped. And it was nice
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:34.000]  in some ways because it was retina and retina in and of itself is, I think that's why they did it,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.320]  is that retina in and of itself is so compelling. Um, and because my wife used that for several
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.800]  years. Yeah. Yeah. But it, you know, was replaced just six months after it came out,
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.720]  which is unusual, but that was because it was, you know, there were problems with the,
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:53.440]  with the iPad three. It was too heavy. It was underpowered and there's no problems with the
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:59.040]  iPhone se like that. No. And, and you know, Apple has shown in the last few years that they're
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.880]  willing to take these products and put them on other something other than a one year cycle.
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.360]  It's like, how do we do more products? One way we do more products as Apple
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:13.280]  is not, not update all our products every year. Right. So, so they, the iPad air is a great
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.880]  example. I've had air too. The iPad mini, uh, had a, had a year where they didn't do a new version
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.840]  of it. Right. And then you come out with one and it's top of the line. Like the iPad air too blew
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:29.760]  us away with how much stuff was in it. And that's good because it was so far ahead that it had a lot
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.360]  of like room to fall a lot of time where it could kind of decay as other products advanced and it
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:39.840]  would still be pretty good. And, and that's still, I mean, cutting the price on it. That's still a
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.120]  pretty great product with a pretty great price even now. But that's that I feel is what the
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.120]  se story is. It's the same thing. It's like, let's max it out now because then it's just
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.400]  going to sit there for a couple of years. Yeah. I kind of feel like it's, it's the iPhone
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:01.920]  five seed done. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the five C like it was literally the old phone
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:08.720]  and uh, with color in it. And I think people felt like they were getting, I think one of the
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.800]  reasons it didn't sell so well is that they felt like they were getting kind of last year's tech.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:18.160]  Yeah. And, and it was not really a new phone. It was just a new wrapper. And the iPhone se is a new
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.880]  phone in an old wrapper. Well, and I know that there are definitely, you know, and we say no,
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:26.640]  you know, we're always speaking, I always speak in extremes cause it's easy when you say nobody
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.600]  wanted to buy last year's phone or nobody wanted to buy a phone that didn't look like a premium
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.320]  iPhone. And of course that's untrue. Plenty of people bought the iPhone five C. I'm sure there's
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:41.040]  lots of people who are still using it. I even, I've been on Apple's campus and not recently,
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.680]  but you know, when it was fresher, I saw people, you know, Apple employees who obviously are well
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:52.080]  informed about the specs, uh, and could have any phone iPhone that they want, who chose the five
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:56.240]  C because they wanted the color. You know, it definitely appealed to some people. Um,
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.080]  San Bernardino County loved it too. I think as, as friend of the show, Ben Thompson knows,
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:07.200]  as pointed out, I think in the aggregate though, it proved to be a mistake to make a phone that
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:12.480]  didn't look like a premium iPhone. The iPhone brand is too con it's, it hinges upon looking
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.960]  like a premium device and therefore it needs to be made out of Apple's premium materials,
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.400]  which at the moment are, you know, anodized aluminum. Yeah. It's almost like, uh, it's,
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.520]  it's psychology that it can be cheaper. That's fine, but it still needs to look like it's
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.440]  premium, like it's expensive. Um, that's, that's an important part of the brand identity, I guess.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:39.360]  So I, my guess is strategically, they're not going to do a new one next year. Uh, maybe I,
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.840]  I wouldn't be surprised if they never make a four inch iPhone again. And I know that that kind of
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:49.280]  is a little contrary to Joss's pitch on stage. It was that we, you know, realized that some people
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:55.120]  prefer a four inch phone. Um, I wouldn't be surprised if they never do again, but it might be
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.480]  completely based on how well the iPhone se sells. If it does sell well enough that they're like,
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:04.000]  yeah, we should, you know, we should definitely keep this in the line, you know, something at this
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.320]  size in the lineup. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't hear, uh, get another one for two years.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:14.080]  Yeah, I, I would be shocked if it wasn't on a two or three year cycle. And that's,
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.840]  that's okay. Not every Apple product needs to get updated every year because we just got,
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.240]  we got trained that there would always be a new one and their bandwidth. I mean, like I said,
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:29.440]  the idea that you've got now three different current iPhone models plus two of last year's
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:35.040]  that are still being made and sold. So there's five new iPhones, right? You can't, and three
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.640]  current models, you can't turn them all over every year. They, they, they just, they can't,
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.720]  they, they Apple, I don't think between its designers and engineers and all that,
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:47.200]  even Apple doesn't have the bandwidth to do that. And all the iPads that they've got now
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.920]  and all the max they've got now. So you pull some things that are less
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.640]  vital and you, and you put them on a two year cycle. There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.960]  And until Monday, the, I, you know, the four inch iPhone that they were selling was from 2013,
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:07.840]  it was two and a half years old. So I wouldn't be surprised at all. And in fact, if you follow the
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:12.800]  Apple as a company of patterns, I think I wouldn't be surprised if maybe we get another one two and
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.200]  a half years from now, maybe they'll do a four inch phone that premieres at the September event.
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.600]  Yeah, it could be, could be, or it'll be another thing like this where in two years, there'll be a,
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.000]  there'll be a spring event and it'll be the, the best tech from the iPhone seven S
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.640]  inside the new iPhone SE. Right. One thing they mentioned multiple times,
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.560]  Jaws mentioned at least, at least twice was that the chamfered edge is now matte instead
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:44.560]  of polished, which is true. It is. You can, if you look at it side by side with an iPhone
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.520]  five or five, five or five S you will see the difference. I thought it was a curious thing
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.160]  that they mentioned multiple times though. Well, I mean, it's like literally the only
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:42:00.960]  thing that's different about the phone. I wonder, I wonder, um, whether that is a decision. I would
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.160]  love to know if that is a decision made for aesthetic reasons or financial reasons, because
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:10.880]  is it, is it that Johnny Ive said, Oh, you know, if I ever get a chance, I'm not going to do a
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.960]  Johnny Ive voice. If I ever get a chance to revisit the five S the thing, the thing that
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.680]  bothers me about it is I really regret the shiny chamfered edge, given that the, that the, the
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:25.760]  rest of the edges are all matte. It was a mistake. Um, or whether it's more like, Hey Johnny, it's
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:30.960]  going to save us like $2 a phone, not to have the chamfered edge be shiny. Do you care? And have
[01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:36.320]  him say, nah, it's fine. And he cared. He cared when the phone was new and he was like, no,
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:39.680]  God damn it. We're going to, you know, we're paying the 50 cents to do it. And now he does.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.080]  It's like, sort of like he doesn't, doesn't really care about the, I'd love to know whether,
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:49.200]  whether it was that financial decision or, or is it like a revisitation of, you know,
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.640]  you know, Oh, I've changed my mind about the chamfered edges. Now I could see it either way.
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.920]  I could see it that maybe it was actually difficult to do the matte finish and they
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.040]  couldn't do it before. And now they, they figured out a way to do it. And now they're,
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:03.280]  that's why they mentioned it twice because it's a hard thing to do. They're proud of it. I don't
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.360]  know either. It's certainly, um, I think it certainly makes the design of the phone more
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.000]  consistent to have it be not shiny on the, on the chamfers because, um, nothing else is shiny.
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:20.160]  Uh, but I don't know from a, from a aesthetic, uh, like, uh, as a hardware designer, what,
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:24.080]  what somebody like Johnny, I would say about it. I, I I'm a little baffled, but like literally
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.200]  that's it for the five S cause the five S has the, has the double flash on the back. So the,
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:33.840]  the camera, the flash, everything other than the apple itself and the, and the,
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.520]  the printing on the back, the only other physical characteristic that is different is that chamfer.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.040]  So I guess if we talk about it, because what else are we going to say? All right. I guess. Um,
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:51.680]  uh, what do you, what do you, what are your thoughts on four inch phones? Are you a four
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.000]  inch? Are you tempted? I'm a, I'm a little bit tempted. Um, it's, I go back and forth on it.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.040]  I mean, the big, big screens are nice. The thing I love about the, about the, um, four inch size
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:09.600]  and the iPhone five design is it's, um, it feels great in the hand. It's easier to hold the sixes
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.400]  do feel slippery and like, like they're like a polished rock. Um, I've never felt comfortable.
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.320]  It's the first, I always wore my, uh, or my iPhone naked. Um, and I put a case on the,
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:23.920]  on the six and I moved that case to the success, the apple leather case, because it just,
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:27.680]  I needed it to be grippier. I felt like it was going to slip out of my hands. I never feel that
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.680]  way with the fives. I've always, I've always felt that they were, they were super solid. Um, but,
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:38.640]  you know, the trade off there is that the, yeah, the screen's a lot smaller. And as somebody who
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:46.160]  is not a commuter anymore, um, I, you know, I don't rely on my iPhone as much as I used to.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.040]  I use it when I'm out and I use it. Like if I'm walking the dog or taking a run or something like
[01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.520]  that, I'm listening to podcasts on it or something like that. But I, I used to use it all the time
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:00.240]  when I was riding the bus and things like that. And I don't, I don't do that anymore. So, um,
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.120]  so for me, it's less of a productivity device than it used to be. And so the smaller screen
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.000]  probably wouldn't make much of a difference to me. Um, and it's, and it's easier to hold. So I'm,
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.200]  I'm kind of on the fence about it. I, I I'm tempted. I totally am tempted. Um, I'm also
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:20.640]  a little reluctant to embrace it because of what we said before, which is it's, it's state of the
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:26.640]  art for six months and then it probably will be not state of the art for the next 18 exactly.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:32.560]  And then, um, and I'm, it's like, however much I prefer the size and I definitely prefer the size,
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:37.520]  I'm not going to not have the top of the line phone. So come September when the iPhone seven
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:42.960]  comes out, I'm going to switch to that anyway, which is why this is a phone for people who,
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.520]  um, aren't, uh, desperate to always be on the cutting edge, like some of us or for somebody
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.920]  for whom the, the larger size is just a deal breaker. And I've heard from, I know a bunch
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.000]  of people who have held onto those five S's because they're like, I don't want a bigger
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.160]  phone. It's too big for me. And, and some of them, I mean, there was a conversation on Twitter that
[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:07.120]  I thought was pretty good about like, you can't, you can overstate saying, well, women have with
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:11.920]  small hands, uh, prefer a small phone because I know a lot of women who love huge phones because
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.560]  they just put their phone in their purse and it doesn't, it doesn't matter. But I, I do know
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:21.840]  people, men and women who find holding that big phone uncomfortable and the little phone a lot
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.880]  more comfortable. And so for those people, uh, you know, I think, or uncomfortable in their pocket or
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.880]  they have small pockets and they can't fit a phone in their pocket. Those are the people who are
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:34.960]  gonna, who are gonna love it as well as all the people who want the, to buy an iPhone. And this
[01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:39.280]  is going to be by far the cheapest iPhone they can buy. Yeah, I do miss, I, there's so much of
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.400]  this design that I miss. I love that it stands up on any side. You can put it sideways to watch
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.840]  video. You can stand it up to take pictures. Uh, there's no camera bump, no camera bump.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.680]  And I'll say this too. It's got a headphone jack on it. So if the future of the iPhone and being
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.680]  on the cutting edge is losing the headphone jack, maybe I'm okay with having the, uh,
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:03.600]  the retro phone that's, uh, that's not on the cutting edge. I don't know.
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.680]  It does feel a little retro. It does. It's funny to talk about something that what the design
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:16.080]  premiered in 2012 to talk about it being retro, but it's, it does. It's from earlier in the decade.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:24.400]  Well, anyway, I like it. And, uh, yeah, my only, the only reason I wouldn't switch from my four S
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:31.040]  or not four S Jesus, uh, the success backed and switched to this size is only because I,
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:35.360]  I think it's, uh, you know, a six, why get used to it for six months and only to go back
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.120]  in September. Cause you're going to want that iPhone seven, whatever it is, right. You're going
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.560]  to want it. Yeah. Well, I honestly, it's the camera quality. And I say that knowing that
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:50.800]  I could, I get slightly better optical, you know, I get the optical image, uh, stabilization in the
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.720]  six in the plus, but I'm not switching to a plus size phone. But w okay. So what happens if there's
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:01.440]  that rumor that there's going to be a super fancy camera, that's only going to be on a plus model.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:08.800]  Would that be enough? Like a really good, um, maybe almost like SLR quality camera on an iPhone,
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.600]  but you had to get the big iPhone. Would you get the big iPhone camera? That is, um, I've been
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:18.800]  thinking about that ever since the rumor. I'm I don't know what I'd do. I don't know. It would be,
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:23.520]  that would be a very hard question because the camera is seriously so important to me. I mean,
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.920]  I know I've said this before, but I know it's called the iPhone, but if I had to pick one
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:32.160]  component to break and the option was you can have, you know, for the rest of the week, you can
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.920]  either use this phone that doesn't make phone calls or you can use this one that doesn't take
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.360]  pictures almost all the time. I'd want the one that, that has the broken phone, but takes pictures.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.880]  It's, it's more of an eye camera to me than an iPhone. Just, yeah, I'd agree. I mean, for me,
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.960]  if, if it, if it, all it did was take pictures and play podcasts, I'd probably be okay with not
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:49:00.000]  having it make phone calls. Right. So I don't know if I really hope that the, the idea that the dual
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.120]  camera is only in the plus, I hope that's not true. Yeah, me too. But I, I could see, I could
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  see them doing that. Right. I mean, and I do think that cameras is one of these, like, we've come so
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:14.720]  far with the smartphones, like we were talking about earlier, but camera technology is like,
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:19.680]  that's one of the frontiers of smartphones. Cameras and then imperviousness to damage,
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.400]  damage seems to me like the big areas here. And I can maybe throw in glare. Like, I'm glad that
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.560]  they've talked about glare and the new iPad, which we'll get to because that's, that's also an issue,
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:33.760]  but it's not like it's gotta be faster. All that is sure. Yeah. It's gotta have more battery life,
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:41.440]  but great cameras in a, in a, in a smartphone is a, you know, that's a huge area of interest
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:45.600]  for anybody who's got it. Cause those are our cameras now. Keep making them better.
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:51.280]  It's you talked about your love of the original iPhone feel and I feel the same way about,
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:55.840]  I love the outside design, but it's, it's always mind blowing to me. I mean,
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.120]  we're nine years into it, but I still feel like it's the new thing, the iPhone,
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:04.080]  but the original iPhone camera was a total piece of crap. It was just like a stock
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.360]  like phone camera part from Japan that they, I don't know. I mean, I'm glad they put it in, but
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:16.480]  it, it was, you know, almost useless for, it was, it was no better than the type of pictures you
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.240]  took with your dumb phone. Really. It didn't even, and it didn't even take video. You couldn't even
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:25.600]  shoot bad video. It just didn't do video. It reminded me of like the bad cam or really,
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:28.800]  I wasn't gonna say the bad cam quarters in the early days of VHS, but no, it reminded me of like
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.040]  the really bad early digital cameras where it's just, you know, it's streaky. It can't do low
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.800]  light at all. It's a miracle that it's there at all, but it's really like, why not put, sure,
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.480]  we should put a camera on it. It's not any good and you would never want to use it unless you
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:46.480]  were desperate, but at least we have it and it's coming a long way. And now we've got people,
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:51.680]  you know, we've got kids, you know, in the intervening nine years, we've got kids who
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:56.800]  their entire, uh, all of the video that's been taken of them as little babies and growing up
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:03.920]  has all been shot on iPhones and it's great quality. Yeah. I mean, 4k, 4k video. It just,
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:08.480]  just like mind blowing. It's on my TV, my TV. I actually do have a 4k TV. I got to figure out a
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.920]  way to put it on there. I could, I could watch that 4k video on there, but it's just, yeah,
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:20.480]  it's come a long way. And yet I take pictures with my SLR, my five-year-old SLR and, um,
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.040]  Ooh, they're, they're way better. Yeah. Right. So there's, there's plenty more work to be done.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:31.920]  Oh, tons of room, especially in, in, uh, in lower light. Yeah. And, and in, in the beauty of having
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:37.600]  these, um, the smartphones having the processors they do right. Is that the image processing is
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:43.840]  part of the equation too. So software and, and, uh, and chip design can help too. So I mean,
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:46.960]  I don't know. Did you see that? There's like a, I think that looks like a smartphone,
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:51.440]  but it's not a smartphone, it's a camera and it's got like nine lenses. Yes. I know exactly
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.880]  what you're talking about. I forget the name. And I know it's really weird, but you do. I think
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:02.480]  we're entering that era now where people are rethinking how you do photography in a, uh,
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:06.720]  given that you have to have a flat device. And the answer is, well, I can't have a long lens,
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:11.680]  but I can have a lot of lenses and use software because I've got this super powerful processor
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:14.720]  here. And so I think things are going to get really interesting for phone photography in
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.640]  the next few years. Yeah, totally. I don't think we're anywhere close to. And I think that the fact
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:24.960]  that the ad campaign that they've really, really been pounding for close to two years, I think now
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:32.080]  is shot with iPhone six. Yeah. You know, I just realized if it, if the ad campaign is shot, shot
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:36.880]  with iPhone success or whatever that I think that's what that is now a shot with iPhone success.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.360]  Will, will they, will they allow pictures shot with the iPhone SE?
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.440]  Like, is that like, is there like a certain truth in advertising that it's
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:52.960]  phone, you know, you can't use a picture shot with iPhone SE if the campaign is shot with iPhone
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:57.760]  success. Maybe it'll just be shot with iPhone. Yeah. That's what I think the campaign should
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:01.760]  be shot with iPhone. I don't think they should. I don't think they should say success,
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:06.960]  although maybe there's some sort of trying to tempt people to upgrade the aspect to it.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.400]  I guess the last thing, and here's another thing that I did not write about on Monday,
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:17.760]  and I think I should have, and I feel like in reading other people's coverage,
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:21.120]  so many excellent pieces that were written, you had a good pitch. You had a good take.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:28.960]  Ben Thompson had a great take. But the one thing I missed was the price. And I feel like in large
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:33.760]  part in recent years, I've really gotten away from talking about prices. I just accept them
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:39.680]  for what they are. And, and I think that it's, I'm doing a disservice to my analysis by not
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:44.240]  taking it into an equation. I think somebody called it out, like in one of my reviews,
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:48.000]  recent big reviews, like maybe for the iPhone success, I didn't even talk about like what
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.400]  the prices were, or whether people should buy it or not. I just talk about what it does.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:54:00.480]  A $399 starting point for a top of the line iPhone is a huge difference. I think that the starting
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:07.280]  price for an iPhone 6s, or I think it was like $649 to buy one without, you know, a contract
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:16.320]  or anything. So it's groundbreaking territory, $399 for slash $499 for the 16 and 64 gig
[01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:22.480]  configurations. Yeah, I've been, I was talking to people about it in terms of the, you know,
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:27.760]  with two year contract price, which is not a thing anymore in most cases. And, and it totally,
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:33.280]  it totally isn't. But we all understand the context of that. And in that context, the iPhone
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:42.000]  SE is free. Right? That's where it's fitting in the line is it's 100 below the, what is it, the
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:49.440]  what is it the 6s base? Yeah, that's where it fits. It fits in the exactly in the same slot as
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:55.600]  the 5s. And that's just remarkable for something that's not two and a half year old technology.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.880]  That's, you know, six month old technology. And Ben Thompson's, it really is. And Ben Thompson's
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.760]  piece that you're talking about was really great because a lot of the criticism was people were
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:11.280]  looking at what its price was going to be in India. It's like retail price. And he's so good
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:17.600]  with some of this international stuff, especially he pointed out that the stores in India don't sell
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:24.480]  at the retail price. And he did a calculation of like, what, considering the street prices
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:29.280]  of existing phones in India, what the street price of this would be. And it basically goes back to
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.600]  they priced it the way they did to get it to be the price they want it to be, which is essentially
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:39.920]  the same price as it is in the US for India. So he deflated some of the criticism of like,
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.800]  the exchange rate ruining the idea that it might be a lower cost iPhone.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:51.120]  Yeah, I don't know. I don't have much to say about the price. But I do think that it's
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:57.600]  noteworthy and it signals a strategic change. The lowest cost iPhone right now for the first
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:06.160]  time in a while has almost all the features of the expensive iPhones, right? It's not
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:10.880]  a low cost because it's two-year-old tech right at the moment. And that's good. It's a good deal
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:16.480]  right now. It's a great deal. Right. And I think that the way that we'll see this is or and you
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:23.520]  know, they don't break out the models that much. They did say on stage, JAWS said that they sold
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:30.480]  30 million four-inch phones in 2015. It was actually your piece that opened my eyes to it,
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:34.800]  because you mentioned that they sell and you're right up that they sell 230 million total. So it's
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:39.440]  still only like 11% because I wrote down in my notes 30 million four-inch phones and I circled
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:44.080]  it like, hey, it's still a popular size. Like I'm not, I'm not a weirdo for wanting a four-inch
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.840]  phone, but then I realized it's only, it's only like 10%. Yeah. Well, it's like 13. I did. I mean,
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:56.960]  the years are probably wrong, but I looked at what they sold last year and, um, and it's 13%
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:01.280]  or something like that. But keep in mind, that's 13% of a one to two, one and a half to two and a
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:06.000]  half year old phone. Right. So they're going to sell more than that. So I think it's totally
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.960]  reasonable that the iPhone SE could be 15 to 20% of total iPhone sales, which is, you know,
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.200]  if you're asking the question, is it worth updating the four-inch phone? Is it worth having
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:23.280]  this as part of your product lineup, which is actually five phones wide? Uh, yeah. I mean,
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.520]  if it's, if you're going to sell 20% of your line is going to be this phone, it's totally worth it.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.640]  Yeah. But I think if it proves as popular as I suspect it will be, which is a little bit more,
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.280]  you know, maybe, maybe it'll creep up to like 15% to 20% of iPhone sold. Now that it has
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.320]  as good a camera and it's just as fast. Cause I feel like that's the two things that even casual
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:47.920]  people, if you tell them this phone is just as fast and it takes just as good a pictures and
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.480]  video as the success, then anybody who's tempted by the size will say, well, I don't, you know,
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:57.120]  I'm, I'm fine with the first generation touch ID sensor and I'm fine without having to pay for it.
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:02.000]  And without having 3d touch and the other little things that are missing, um, it's going to affect
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.800]  the average selling price of iPhone, right? It's, this is a move where I think strategically Apple
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:14.000]  is now willing to have the average selling price of iPhone drop in order to sell more phones
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:20.080]  throughout the world. Yeah. I, I agree. Although I think it'll be less dramatic than we might think
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:24.320]  because of the fact that they already were selling a phone at this price. It's just going to be a
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:27.920]  more for, and again, it's going to be a, that curve where it's going to be the current phone
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:33.600]  for six months and then it's going to be a step behind the high end phones for a year after that.
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:38.960]  And then for another unknown period after that, it'll presumably be two years behind. So it'll
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:44.080]  have a, you know, it'll have a sales curve that'll go back down, but for the first six months or year
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.960]  it'll, it'll eat into the ASPs a little bit, right? Because just because it's a better phone
[01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:52.400]  at that, at that price point, but it's not like they didn't have one there before that wasn't,
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:57.120]  you know, they sold whatever it was 20 million of them at that price in the last year. So,
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:02.000]  um, you know, the, the ASP change is only going to be in sort of the difference between,
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.240]  uh, the, the boost that they get because it's a much better phone, but they are willing to do that.
[01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:12.480]  There's no doubt about it. Yeah. Um, anything else on an iPhone before we move on?
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:18.400]  I don't know. I mean, I think we, I think we got on the phone that has, it's all entirely things
[01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:25.360]  that have already existed before we move on to the iPad pro, the new iPad pro. I will take a moment
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:33.760]  here to thank our, um, uh, our last sponsor. Uh, and it's a new sponsor. I love these. I love
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:41.520]  these people. I've tried this and it is terrific. It's hello fresh, H E L L O F R E S H. They are
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:47.520]  a meal kit delivery service and they make cooking fun, easy and convenient. So you sign up and you
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.240]  can, uh, you can get like, uh, uh, three meals a week or four meals a week. You get five meals
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:56.640]  a week and, and they're designed for either two or four people. So you say, uh, we're a family of
[01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:03.280]  four. We want three meals a week. They have new recipes, uh, and meals every week. You pick the
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:09.440]  ones that appeal to you that you want. And then the food just shows up at your door in a box.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:14.960]  And it's, they use like, um, dry ice to keep the stuff cold and stuff like that. Everything shows
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:20.880]  up and it's all the exact right amount of quantities. So there's no, nothing to waste.
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:25.040]  So it, and it really does work out well. We've done this and it, the food is great. It comes
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:29.600]  at, it's super, super attractive. I was always worried with a meal delivery thing. It's like,
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.040]  I'm kind of picky when I'm in the supermarket. Like when I pick the produce, like I want,
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:37.120]  you know, I don't want like a green pepper that's squishy. I want a good one. Everything
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.680]  that they sent us was absolutely perfect. I mean, just super, super great stuff,
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:47.760]  really fresh ingredients. Um, and the recipes are all designed to, um, to be done in 30
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:53.680]  minutes or less. And the recipes are terrifically well-explained. I mean, even an idiot like me who
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:01:02.320]  can't cook could do it. Um, it is, I can't say enough good stuff, good food, good recipes,
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:10.800]  great instructions, incredibly convenient. Um, I, it's amazing to me that this works. It feels
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:14.640]  like I'm living in the future and it saves you from going to the grocery store. Um,
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.520]  can't say enough good things about it. Give it a try. You get 35 bucks off your first week of
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:28.560]  deliveries by, by using this code. You just use the code talk show and you go to hellofresh.com.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:35.120]  So you go to hellofresh.com, take a look at it, pick out the ones that you want and you'll save
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:43.360]  $35 just by using the code talk show T A L K S H O W. Uh, can't say enough good stuff about it.
[02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:46.320]  Highly recommend it. Uh, go give them a try. Hello fresh
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:53.440]  groceries just delivered right to your door. Crazy. It's what a world we live in.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.080]  Oh, so then we got, now we have the iPad pro, which I guess we could start by just talking
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.200]  about the name, which was as rumored that there is nothing, you know, it's not the iPad air three.
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.960]  It is just called iPad pro. And I guess that's not unprecedented, right? Because the name of
[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.720]  the 13 inch Mac book pro is Mac book pro and the name of the 15 inch Mac book pro is Mac book pro.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:20.560]  So it's just, you know, specify it by size. It kills me. The decimals though makes me sad.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:25.520]  I really like to refer to these as the 10 and 13 inch iPads. They're, they're a little bit,
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:30.640]  they come up a little short. So I, there is nothing like you talk about having problems
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:35.200]  as a product review or boo hoo, but I have to set up like a keyboard shortcut or something for
[02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:44.400]  9.7 inch iPad pro every time I type that now. Yeah. It's like the little one or the 10. I
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.280]  call it the 10 inch, but it's not 10 inches diagonal. It's 9.7 inches. So I'm already
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.080]  sick of, I'm already sick of typing it out. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. I mean, maybe we can come
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.440]  up with a nickname for it, but you know, that, that was the advantage of saying 11 inch Mac
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:03.440]  book here. It's like 11 inch is better than 9.7 inch. That's not fun to, to write, but it does
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:10.000]  make sense. I mean, this is, this is the laptop. Laptop of vacation. I don't know of the, uh,
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.400]  of the iPad line where it's like, instead of saying, we're going to count by one,
[02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:18.640]  every time we release one and we're going to keep the old ones around instead, it strikes me that
[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:23.520]  this is a little bit more like, Nope, these are the slots. We've got a big one and a little one,
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:28.880]  and those are our iPad pros. And next year, if we, if we update them, they're just going to
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:33.040]  fit in these slots and the old ones will go away and the new ones will be here. And that's just
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:37.360]  like, like we do with laptops and desktops, right? There's no other than like the ones
[02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.040]  they keep around for education, like the non retina Mac book pro. I mean, generally
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:46.560]  when the retina Mac book pro gets updated, they don't keep the old one around too. It's like,
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.400]  these are the, they replace them with, with new ones. And these are the new ones. I feel like
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:55.840]  that's what they're doing with the iPads. Yeah. I feel like it's a sign of, uh,
[02:03:57.120 --> 02:04:03.360]  at least from Apple's perspective that they see this as it, once it's gotten the, this year is
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:08.720]  the year that the iPad became like, uh, an established product, or maybe that's the wrong
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.960]  word, but that it's, it's kind of grown up to the point where it's, and, and they're, you know,
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:18.160]  they're the whole push that Schiller gave on stage for is that this is a credible alternative to
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:23.600]  somebody to upgrading from an older PC. This can, this can be your primary big screen computer
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.760]  other than the phone. And I feel like by calling them, you know, pro that's,
[02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.080]  this is finally the point where they could say that that's true.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.640]  Yeah. I think it's a moment. It's just, it's a moment in the life of the iPad.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.960]  All right. There was, um, uh, controversy might be the wrong word, but people definitely wrote
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:48.240]  about it. Um, that, that Schiller, when he mentioned that he said that there are 600 million
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:54.400]  PCs in use that are five plus years old. And we think that's really sad. And everybody laughed
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:05:00.000]  and there, the controversy, I guess, or the complaint about it is that it's, uh, sort of
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:07.600]  tone deaf to the economic, the perfectly logical and sensible lot economic reasons why people
[02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:13.760]  might be using six or seven year old PCs. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like, yeah, I, I, I had
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:21.120]  that thought at the time of like, well, this is in the category of making some jokes at the expense
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:27.920]  of PCs and making some jokes from the perspective of being a computer manufacturer who wants you to
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:35.520]  buy new things, but not like, but like missing the point, especially since legendarily Apple's
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:40.400]  computers have been the ones that have lasted a long time. Right. And so to say a five-year-old
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:45.360]  PC is sad. Um, does that make a five-year-old Mac sad? Does that make an eight-year-old Mac sad?
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:50.720]  Does it make John Syracuse's Mac pro sad? His 20 year old Mac pro. Yeah, but it's still kicking.
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:55.680]  So, um, I, I don't know. I get what he, I get what he was trying to say. I get what he was trying to
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:06:00.880]  say. That's like, these old PCs are hanging on and they weren't that great to begin with. And,
[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:06.720]  uh, and I mean, I was, if I, if I could channel him, what I'd say is the people who are using
[02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:13.520]  those old PCs, a lot of them are people who don't need a PC. Five years ago, this was the only thing
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:19.440]  they could get to get on the internet. Like you buy a computer to get on the internet. Um, and a
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:22.640]  lot of that stuff, if all you're doing, like my mom was like this, my mom had a Mac book pro for
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:28.640]  a long time, and now she has an iPad and she is very happy with her iPad air and not having a
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:34.320]  Mac book pro anymore because it was her laptops for years. Her Mac laptops were the, her gateway
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:39.200]  to the internet, her gateway to do especially email. And, uh, you know, there are other devices
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:43.440]  that do that now that are way better for that purpose. And the iPad is that device for her.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.200]  And so I think that's what Schiller was kind of getting at is this idea that, you know,
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:53.920]  these old PCs, you bought them because you needed to do things with them that you don't need to use
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:07:00.240]  a PC for anymore. And you can just dump them, get an iPad and you'll be happy. Um, but it did, I,
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:06.240]  I had that thought of like, you know, is it sad? I mean, P other than that, PCs are sad in general,
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:10.800]  which I think was part embedded in his statement. Yeah, exactly. And it's, we have to realize that
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:18.800]  when Apple talks about PCs, PC is Apple lingo for windows PC. Like the Mac is a personal computer,
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:24.400]  but the Mac is not an Apple lingo, a PC, even though logically it is. And that's sort of,
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:29.600]  you know, a lot of what Schiller was saying is just as much an argument about why somebody
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.960]  doesn't need a Mac instead of just using an iPad. And it's a little bit, you know, it,
[02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:42.800]  it's like windows, windows PCs become the whipping boy for the iPad marketing, but it's, it's a little
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:47.360]  not uncomfortable, but it's a little bit like, I, I, I knew with the direction Schiller was going
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.480]  and how hard he was pushing it. I knew there wasn't going to be any surprise Mac books at
[02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:54.800]  that event. Cause there's no way you could bring Mac books on stage after everything he said about
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:00.000]  how you don't need a traditional PC. Yeah, it did. I, I had the, that thought of like,
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:05.760]  going to be hard to introduce Macs now. I mean, just cause it's like laptops are unnecessary.
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:14.240]  Also we have laptops. Right. Like, well, like imagine, you know, it's the same way that like,
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.840]  imagine if instead of unveiling a smaller iPhone, if they had unveiled, if the iPhone SE was bigger
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:23.920]  iPhone, like it was 5.7 inches, the biggest phone we've ever had, you don't even need a tablet
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.880]  anymore. Then you can't have iPads come out after that. Right. You know, this can replace a tablet
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.960]  for, for a lot of people. If that was the selling of the iPhone, then you can't come out afterwards
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:40.000]  with iPad. So I kind of knew that. And I, I, I guess the other thing is that I think it's,
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.560]  it's just innate to somebody who's a long time, uh, Apple person like Schiller to kind of want
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:50.720]  to crack jokes at windows expense. That's to me, it was clearly what Schiller intended. It
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:57.680]  was sort of a joke at windows being crappy and older windows, even worse, right. A six or seven
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:09:01.760]  year old windows machine is even worse than at least a modern, faster one. And that's kind of
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:07.440]  sad, but it definitely played wrong. I mean, it was way more than one person emailed me about it.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:13.520]  And, uh, you know, I think it was an unusual misstep for, for Apple, but I think it's, I can
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:17.440]  see how they made it though, because internally it made all the sense in the world. I wouldn't be
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:21.920]  surprised if he said the exact same thing word for word in rehearsals and nobody, it didn't even
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:26.320]  occur to anybody. Everybody just saw it as a joke at windows expense. Any of us who have, who know
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.400]  what the Apple lexicon is, can look at what was said and be like, I get what he was saying there,
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:35.280]  right. But, but yes, it seems like they maybe didn't have that second thought, which is,
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:40.720]  but this is not how it will necessarily be perceived. Um, and you know, the, the usual
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:45.440]  suspects, like I was waiting for Kyle Wiens at iFixit to chime in, which he did about it.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:49.760]  Cause it's like, uh, that's been his thing for a long time that Apple, you know, Apple wants
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:54.480]  you to have your computer be disposable and you get rid of it and replace it with a new one
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:58.240]  rather than fixing it yourself. And here's somebody who fixed their, their Mac book. And I
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:03.520]  just referred my mom's old Mac book pro. I put an SSD in it and I maxed the Ram out and I sold it.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.200]  Um, I was going to give it to a friend and then they didn't, they bought a new computer. So I
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:12.000]  sold it on Craigslist to a college student, but it was pretty great after, after I got the spinning
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:16.720]  hard drive out of it and put it in an SSD and maxed out the Ram, it was, it was a 2009 or
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.920]  something. And it was still, it's still fine. I saw a guy at Starbucks like a week or two ago
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:29.840]  using, uh, the black Mac book and he, he obviously kept it in tremendous shape because it was all,
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:36.080]  it just looked great. It looked like near mint. Uh, and it was one of those moments where I was
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.480]  like, Oh, what kind of computers I got using that looks cool. And then I realized what it was,
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:44.560]  that it was an old black Mac book. And I was like, wow, hats off to that guy, man. He really takes
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:49.360]  care of that thing. But also hats off to Apple for making a design that 10 years later still
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:52.720]  made me think, Whoa, what is that cool thing? You can get to the hard drive right from the
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:56.640]  battery bay for that one. So you could pull that out and put in an SSD really easily. And
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:59.840]  it's amazing how many of the old computers, the big problem with them is just that the drives
[02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.560]  are really slow. So that's like number one tip is, you know, but I, I get what, yeah,
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:10.240]  I get what Phil Schiller was saying and it just, it made it difficult to, uh, to talk about Macs
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:14.080]  at the event. And I certainly had opened to him to a little bit of criticism. I get what they
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:19.920]  were saying, right? Here's what I would like. I would be interested to know is not how many, um,
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:27.120]  how many five year old PCs are in use, but how many like three, four year old iPads are in use?
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:33.520]  Yeah. Cause I still think I firmly believe that the quote unquote problem with iPads with the
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:38.560]  way that sales have actually declined and sort of steadily gone down, but are still pretty,
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.600]  you know, compared to the PCs, you know, it's still like, they still sell like 10 million
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.960]  of them a quarter. It's not, it's not going away. I still think though that the fundamental problem
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:54.480]  is that people get problem from Apple's perspective is if people get an iPad and if they like it,
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:57.680]  what they like about it, they still like three, four years later, they don't,
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:02.000]  they don't see the need to up upgrade until the thing breaks.
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.200]  Yeah, I agree. I think, uh, this is the, you know, the, there's the, like, I forget exactly
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:12.560]  the details, but it's the legend of like, you make a product so great that nobody ever needs
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.200]  a replacement and you go out of business because you can't, you know, you can't do that. That's
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:22.240]  although that story is actually the story of every app developer, right? Like you sell it once and
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:28.560]  then you can't ever sell it again because it's free updates forever. And in my, if I'm right,
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:33.360]  then the reason sales were so much higher in the early years of like around 20 million a quarter
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:40.480]  is because there was the iPad, there was nothing like it. And so it was an unfulfilled, uh,
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:45.040]  desire on the marketplace. Like when people were realizing, wow, I think I could really use one
[02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:48.640]  of those things cause they didn't have anything like it. And so it was on that, the sales were
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:56.400]  unnaturally high compared to where they quote unquote should be. Yeah. And I would love to know
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.760]  that because that's clearly, you know, the idea is, look, if you have an old creaky,
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.400]  this is what the Apple saying, if you have an old slow PC and you're looking to buy a new thing,
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:09.680]  you should look at this, look at this iPad pro. This is, you know, it, it, it's the feature
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.400]  of computing. It has everything you need and it does these other, it's better in so many ways.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:22.160]  Um, and I think that that kind of might apply to iPads. It might be like, look, you think you,
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.160]  your iPad's still good enough, but the new ones we've done so much in the last four years,
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:31.840]  and this is so much lighter and it's got stereo sound and a better display. Um,
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:37.360]  I think that it's, you know, they've got to start marketing it towards, you know,
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.000]  people who, who have old iPads. I feel like they're going to sell a lot of the,
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:49.200]  of the little iPad pro because that is the mainstream size. Um, and maybe not to people
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:53.440]  who already have an iPad air too, although probably to some of them too, but to older iPads,
[02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.240]  you know, it's newer and lighter, it's got the pencil support. I think the pencil on that size
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:02.960]  is going to be big for a lot of people. And so, so I feel like that, that is the product
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:08.960]  that we've been sort of waiting for for the last year of, you know, what's the next 10 inch iPad
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:14.640]  and, and what features is it going to have? And it's pretty impressive set of features that it's
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.720]  got. So I feel like they are going to, whether it's going to make a difference in terms of the
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:25.360]  iPads overall, like sales decline, who knows, but I do feel like it will be enough to motivate a
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:29.760]  bunch of people to, uh, to upgrade their old iPads. And they haven't had any motivation for
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:35.120]  a year and a half. Uh, so one of the things that really interested me about it was it wasn't just
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:45.840]  a shrunk down 12 inch or 12.9 inch, uh, iPad pro it actually, it, it gained a little in terms of
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.480]  the display and the camera. It has a superior camera and a better display and it lost a little
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:56.800]  in that it doesn't have the new super fancy USB three lightning port. And I don't think there's
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:01.520]  anything else that's missing. I could be wrong, but I, I, you know, so it's on the plus side,
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:06.400]  it's a superior iPad in terms of the display and having the true tone technology, uh, and the
[02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:12.880]  camera, which is again, like the, on the iPhone se it's the success camera assembly or camera system,
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:21.280]  um, including the bump, uh, and on the lightning, it doesn't have USB three. So that's interesting
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:26.880]  to me because I, I, and I'm not even quite sure how that came about. It's like you would think it
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:30.400]  would have, it would, I can see how it's better in some ways, but I'm surprised it doesn't have
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.320]  USB three. Yeah. I was talking to Christina Warren about this the other day and, uh, I,
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:40.880]  I gave her this like scenario of like, if I'm mr moneybags and I walk into an Apple store and
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:48.080]  I say, provide to me your finest iPad, um, with all of the greatest features, they, they can't
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:53.200]  because some of them are on the iPad pro and some of them are on, or some of them are on, sorry,
[02:15:53.200 --> 02:15:58.480]  the, the big iPad pro and some of them are on the small iPad pro and it's just a weird combination
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:02.560]  of them that, that, you know, true tone, you want the true tone, get the small one. You want USB
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:08.320]  three transfer speeds, get the big one. Yeah. That's an interesting, you want a good camera,
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:14.160]  get the small one, right? Hmm. You want the, and it's got the color. You want the same color gamut
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:20.800]  as the modern, like the, the 2015 model IMAX retina IMAX that's on the small one, not the big
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:27.920]  one. Right. Uh, I don't know. Kind of, you know, I, I'm assuming it'll work itself out eventually,
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:32.960]  you know, six months from now or a year from now, but it's an interesting state of affairs. I can't
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:38.720]  help but think it probably has, it's probably just comes down to component pricing. I'm guessing that
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:44.720]  they wanted to hit us, right? So the big iPad pro is, is at, you know, starts at a much higher
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.520]  price and this one starts at five 99 and I guess because the display is smaller, they can afford to
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:54.880]  make it better. I don't know. I'm just guessing that whatever complicated math goes into figuring
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:59.120]  out how, you know, how do we make it so we can sell this at five 99 with the margins we want
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:05.680]  that USB three didn't make the cut. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, uh, it's, uh, if I had to guess,
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.120]  it's a weird combination of what price, what, what features do we omit from the small, the smaller
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.120]  model? Because we just don't have the margins for it. And what new innovations do we have
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.400]  that we can put in a brand new product that wasn't available six months ago. And this is what you get
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:25.680]  is you get their product, some features removed because you want to hold the line on margins.
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.160]  But we came up with this true tone thing and it wasn't ready for the, the, the big iPad pro,
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:33.600]  but it's ready now. So let's ship it in there and get, and get something to do with it.
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:37.920]  Now. So let's ship it in there and get, and get something new in there. Um, this is why,
[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:45.360]  uh, ideally you don't ship your product line in alternating cycles like this, right? Ideally,
[02:17:45.360 --> 02:17:49.120]  you say, here are all the new iPad pros, like you're all the new retina MacBook pros,
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.920]  and you do it at once. And then you can explain, well, the 15 has some things that 13 doesn't
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.200]  like when I, I had an 11 inch air, right? And the 11 inch air doesn't have the card reader,
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:01.200]  for example. It's like, all right, it just, it doesn't, but that's okay. But if the 11 inch air
[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:05.920]  was out of sync with the 13 inch air and got the new features first, but also lacked some old
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.880]  features because the small one doesn't get those, you'd be where we are with the iPad pro where
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:15.440]  they're just kind of out, out of step. And that's a question about, you know, are they going to be
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.200]  in step now? Is every spring, are we going to get new iPad pro models? Is that how it's going to
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:23.920]  work? I don't know. Yeah. I wonder, or maybe because now it's a mature, like I said, like
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:29.040]  mature, like in the way that the MacBook pros are mature, maybe they come out on a iPad to come out
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:33.840]  on a, there, when they're ready, we will release some schedule, you know, that there is no, like,
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:39.040]  there's no real pattern to when we expect new Mac books. They, you know, we get rumors of when
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:46.640]  they're coming out and people who pay attention to Intel's, you know, chip pipeline can estimate,
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:51.440]  you know, well, you know, this chip set is coming out soon or this one's delayed. So new Mac books
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:56.000]  are probably delayed, but it's, there's no, like, it's not like with the iPhone where you'd know
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:02.240]  that it's going to be like a Tuesday in the middle of September. Right. Here's the, here's a
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:07.280]  fascinating fact and I cannot explain it. So the camera bump, I hate camera bumps or really do. I
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:16.080]  know I, to an irrational degree, really hate the camera bump on the iPhone six and success. Really,
[02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:21.840]  really hate it. I just, every time I, and I, my thumb just goes to it, like, like rubbing like a
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:27.280]  pimple on your, on your other hand, or like playing with a wart or something. The other
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:34.080]  advantage of, of sticking it in a case is that I don't have that. I really, it's the closest.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:38.800]  That's the main reason that I almost carried my success. And I even spent like a month with it
[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:43.760]  in a case is for exactly that reason, because it alleviated the bump. So the iPad has the bump,
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:49.840]  the iPad, new iPad pro, but when you put it on a tabletop, it does not wiggle. It doesn't wobble.
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:54.880]  I don't understand how this is possible. I don't, I don't, I know. And Matthew Pansarino tweeted
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:59.360]  about it and people saying that he's full of shit and, you know, saying you're lying, that's
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.000]  impossible. And he like shot a video and it's like, you lay it on a flat table and it doesn't
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.480]  wobble. I don't, I guess it's, I don't understand. I'm sure it has something to do with the curvature
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:14.400]  of the earth. Um, I, my guess is that there's something, you know, you've got, it's a much
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:19.920]  a larger item than the much larger surface than the iPhone. So it probably has something to do
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:26.960]  with the angle of the lift of it being reduced by that amount of distance. So that it's, it's, um,
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:31.760]  it's imperceptible compared to, um, something that's very, cause if you had something that
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:36.880]  was really small and there was like a bump on one side and maybe my, the, the, the angle would
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:42.640]  be greater. Maybe my dining room table isn't perfectly flat. I don't know. It could be it's,
[02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.280]  but, and so somebody out there might have the earth. I'm telling you, somebody out there,
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:51.680]  it's physics, man. It might wobble on somebody's table. And I'd be interested to hear from anybody
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:55.360]  if, if they get it and it does wobble. But I, if you're concerned about the camera bump,
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:58.800]  is that when you lay it flat on a table, it's going to wobble. I'm telling you it doesn't. So
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:03.600]  it's got that going for it. Well, that's good. Cause that would be a disaster. If that was the
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:07.840]  case, like, Hey, it's got the Apple pencil. You can draw on it. Now lay it on a table. Nope.
[02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:15.520]  That would be awful. Um, otherwise I don't, you know, I, I don't know what to, what else to say
[02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:21.040]  about it. It's, you know, it's the iPad pro it's got the pencil. So, so when, when, uh,
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.720]  when they announced the true tone feature, um, somebody in the audience went, ah, and, uh,
[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:30.560]  Phil Schiller went, ah, somebody knows what I'm talking about. And after where you said it was
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:34.560]  you, I swear to God, that was, it was, I'm not surprised. I'm so not surprised. I don't think
[02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:41.920]  that's quite the noise I made, but I did. I did. You probably reacted. I audibly reacted because
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:47.520]  to me, it's like the next step up from retina, like, and I wanted retina screens, you know,
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.280]  my entire life. So I can no longer see the pixels because clearly that's the way it should be. But
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:58.480]  to, to adjust for color temperature is the next, you know, something I've thought of for as long
[02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:02.640]  as I've been using computers, because I've noticed that boy, wait at nighttime, when you have
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:08.160]  incandescent lights on, uh, boy, the white doesn't look like white anymore, or it looks too white or
[02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:14.800]  something, you know, that it's not like paper. Right. Well, it's not, it's not white balancing,
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.720]  like, you know, our eyes white balance to man match the temperature of the light, but the,
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:24.880]  the, the, the device doesn't know, right. It's just set to whatever color temperature it's set
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:29.600]  to. And that's what you get. Right. Um, it's a, it's a great idea. I want to see it in practice,
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:32.960]  right? I want, I want to go through that and see whether this is something that I really,
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:37.440]  you know, I really noticed or not, but I like, I really like the idea of it. And like Craig
[02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:42.160]  Hockenberry was saying, this is, there's a lot of color management business that's happening on,
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:48.800]  on the iPad these days. And, and for any of us from, um, the old, uh, sort of desktop publishing
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:54.160]  days, the idea that you've got really interesting things happening with color on these devices
[02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:58.800]  is a really great. I was talking to, to, um, when I talked to Glenn Fleischmann, I was on the Mac
[02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:03.920]  World podcast 500 and we were talking about this and, um, and he, he mentioned that this is one of
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:07.840]  those moments where you kind of wish, uh, Bruce Fraser was still around because he would love,
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:12.000]  he would love this. He was a, he, he passed away a few years ago, but he was a color management,
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.400]  like God, basically, I learned so much from that guy about how human, the brain perceives color
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:23.040]  and all of this stuff. And, uh, it's really interesting to see Apple go down this path where
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:27.520]  it's like, you know, we all just took for granted that the white point of your display was what it
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:32.800]  was. Remember when you used to have to calibrate it manually? Oh yeah. Like, uh, cross your eyes
[02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:39.280]  and adjust this thing until you get the right gamma. Yeah. Oh yeah. And then they make like
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:42.480]  things with suction cups that you'd stick on your screen and then it would put something on it and
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:46.960]  it would read what the light was off of it. And it would know how to calibrate the display so that
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:51.040]  it would get the color that would be the same as the color that you would print and the same as the
[02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:56.160]  color that would come out on the offset press when you printed your catalog, all of that, you know,
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:01.680]  just so much goes into that. Um, and, and it's a little bit like, there's like memory color, this
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:05.920]  idea that, that it's almost like an optical illusion. It's your brain, your brain knows what
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:11.440]  colors things are. So it will actually adjust what you see to be the color that it isn't. Like if you
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:16.480]  see an Apple and it's red, but it's the wrong red, your brain like corrects it and makes it the
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.960]  right red. And that's not what you're seeing, but it's what you think you're seeing. And then
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:25.600]  so there's so much in here. And so for Apple to like dip their toe in and be like, yeah,
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.200]  we're going to, we're going to work on color now where this is the next frontier for us
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:33.040]  is, uh, it's really interesting beyond just the, the true tone feature.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:40.160]  Yeah. It's, I haven't spent, I have the iPad pro, I have a review unit of it. Um, I haven't
[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.320]  spent it so far. I haven't, I spent most of my time with the iPhone, not the iPad. So I've,
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.760]  I've tinkered with it. Um, um, but not, I haven't really spent that much more time with it. Really
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:54.560]  looking at the, at the night or not night shift, the, the true tone than you did at the event,
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:25:00.400]  really. Um, it, but it's, it is nice. It definitely, it is, and it's not a gimmick.
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:05.920]  It's an, I totally believe Schiller that once you get used to it, you want it on all your devices.
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:09.120]  I think it's going to have a better effect than the, than the night shift thing.
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:13.840]  I think night shift is, is a gimmick. I mean, and if there's people out there who listen,
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:17.360]  who really do feel like they get a better night's sleep with it, then good. I, I, you know,
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:21.040]  I wish everybody a good night's sleep, but to me, it seems like a gimmick.
[02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:27.680]  Yeah, it's, um, I think it's, it's fine, but I, I, when I think about true tone, I think what,
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:36.880]  what, um, the best benefit of night shift is solved by true tone. That night shift,
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:42.640]  I use night shift. I've been using the nine three beta for a while on my iPad pro because, um, the,
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:49.440]  the big iPad pro, um, had the nine point 9.2 was quirky on the big iPad pro. So I've been using
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:54.080]  the beta for a while. And so I've had nice shift and I find myself using it a lot at night.
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:26:00.080]  And in the early morning when I've got incandescent lights and the, the super blue
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:06.800]  white color temperature of the, of the display is like totally out of whack with my surroundings.
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:11.600]  Well, a nice shift can do that, but true tone does that true tone does that solve that same problem
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:17.120]  where the white that you're seeing on your screen is in context with the rest of your environment.
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:22.800]  And when you do that, um, I feel like you've got the, you've got most of the problem solved that,
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.320]  that for me, like I don't even need night shift. If I've got a device that will just make my iPad
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:34.640]  screen warm when I'm in the warm, dark light of my living room at 10 at night, it could just be,
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:39.680]  yeah, I it's, to me, it's just making it look better. It's not about magically get, you know,
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:44.960]  that this solves the problem of getting a good night's sleep. And again, if I could be wrong,
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:48.560]  I don't know, but I thought even the way Apple spoke about night shift on stage was sort of like
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:53.440]  acknowledging that this is junk science that, or at least that the science is the quote unquote
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:57.600]  science behind it is a little questionable. They were like, some people say they get a better night
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:02.800]  sleep. Uh, I think that the problem, and I totally believe that there is a problem there. I just
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:07.280]  think the problem is staring at glowing screens period and that color shifting it isn't solving
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.640]  the problem. Did you see Glenn's piece on Macworld? No, I don't think I did. It's new. As we record
[02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:16.320]  this, I think it was today that it, well, then I definitely didn't see it. He talked, he actually
[02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:20.000]  talked to some people who are researchers in this field and I'm sure people are going to be
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.840]  skeptical and they're going to, they're going to try to debate him on this. But what Glenn basically
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:29.840]  said is, um, it's not, if it, if it helps you, if you feel it helps you great, but there's not
[02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:34.800]  a lot of science to suggest that at the levels where Apple is doing this, where they're still
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:40.720]  keeping some blue in there. So it's, so it's just less, it's, uh, it's, it's an issue of brightness
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.160]  and the fact that they're not cutting all the blue out because if you cut all the blue out,
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:48.080]  um, it would look really bad. Like you wouldn't want to use it. And so they're keeping some of
[02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:51.840]  it in there. I think it looks, I think it looks bad with as much blue as they're taking out.
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:56.720]  That's the reason I don't like it. So, so that's the, so what his point is, you know, yeah, it's,
[02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:00.800]  your brightness is a big factor in it too. And, and how much does this affect the melatonin in
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:06.240]  your brain? And I think everybody would say that, yeah, not having bright glowing screens
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:11.840]  is going to help you sleep better, but having a slightly less bright, slightly less blue glowing
[02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:16.560]  screen that you're looking at, it may, it may not help enough to override the fact that you're
[02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:21.360]  watching that screen. Right. I think you did. You're kind of kidding yourself. You know,
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:25.680]  maybe the answer is, you know, read a book, turn off, turn off the TV and give yourself an hour
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:29.200]  where you're just reading a book or something like that. Right. Get a subscription to the paper
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:35.200]  edition of your favorite magazine. Yeah. All right. I want to talk a little bit about Gary
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:39.360]  Shandling. I'm just assuming that you were a Shandling fan. Yeah, I didn't see as much. I
[02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:44.560]  never had premium cable. So I came to a lot of it late. Like I watched the Gary, it's Gary Shandling
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.320]  show on Fox when they cut it up and put it on Fox. Cause I never had, when I was a kid, I, we
[02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:54.880]  didn't even have cable. So I certainly didn't have showtime. And then Larry Sanders also, it was like
[02:28:54.880 --> 02:29:00.400]  a sporadic thing where they were getting, um, did they get rerun somewhere else? I saw them, but I
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:05.760]  saw them like late. I was never right, like in on it. But also as I mean, we talked about as a,
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:11.120]  as a late on talk show person, I just remember him from all of his great guest bits and guest
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.040]  host bits on the tonight show and on a Letterman. All right. Well, before we talk about Shandling,
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:19.040]  let's, I want to thank our fourth and final sponsor and it's our good friends at mail route
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:26.640]  M a I L R O U T E I T departments are expected to do more in 2016, but of course you're getting less
[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:31.760]  money. Uh, and that includes really important stuff like stopping spam and virus attacks,
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:37.600]  going through the email that you are responsible for you being those of you listeners at the show,
[02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:43.120]  who, uh, are in the it department who are responsible for email. Or if like me,
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:47.360]  you're just a one, you know, one person who owns a domain name that you get email through.
[02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:52.160]  Um, if you're in charge of the email for a domain mail route is something you really ought to look
[02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:57.200]  at. Um, who can you trust to do the job and stick around mail route. These guys at mail route,
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:30:04.080]  this is all they do is, is email. Um, they protect your email and your hardware or your server
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:08.800]  against spam viruses and other texts. They don't host your email for you. There's mail route isn't
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:13.280]  a company that hosts email for you. So you keep the mail server you already have. What you do is
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:18.320]  you change your MX records for your domain name to point through mail route first. And it's just
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:25.040]  like a screen. Email goes to them and then from mail route, it goes on to your existing regular
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:30.960]  mail server, except without any of the spam and without any of the junk. Uh, you can set it up
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:35.760]  and just have it go through. And as soon as the MX records update, it just works and that's it.
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:39.920]  You're done. You don't even have to touch it. Um, but if you want to, if you want to nerd out and
[02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:45.280]  customize it, they have an API that can, uh, you can program it, you can do all sorts of super
[02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:50.400]  nerdy stuff. I mean, if you're an email nerd, you're going to love this. Um, the spam filtering
[02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:57.600]  that they do is as good as any that I've seen. Uh, you know, some of my domains are go through
[02:30:57.600 --> 02:31:02.720]  Google and Google has great spam filtering. Uh, I think Apple's spam filtering has gotten a lot
[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:07.920]  better with mac.com over the years. Uh, mail route spam filtering is just as, as good as it
[02:31:07.920 --> 02:31:13.440]  can get almost no false positives and almost all the junk goes through. It just, it's, it's like
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:19.600]  the old days of email before spam was invented. It's amazing. They've also got, and I think this
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:24.000]  is key. They've got great interface for going through and checking to, you know, if you need
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.440]  to check to see if something was erroneously flagged to spam or something like that, you can
[02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:32.560]  still get it. It's not like the spam, what they call spam just gets flushed away, uh, could not
[02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:39.520]  be better. Uh, they have price matching for McAfee and MX logic customers. I don't even know what MX
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:44.480]  logic is, but if you do, then you ought to talk to mail her out because, uh, they've got price
[02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:50.080]  matching. You can stop spam today for free. You get a 30 day free trial, try it for 30 days,
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:53.280]  totally free. And if you don't like it, just change your MX records back. You don't even,
[02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:57.280]  it's not, you have to move all your email around. It couldn't be easier to turn to switch it off if
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:05.280]  you don't want to use it. Um, so here's where you go. Mail route.net slash TTS, mail route.net slash
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:12.160]  TTS, or you can even email them at sales at mail route.net and just ask questions and, and see if
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:19.280]  it's for you. Uh, and use that mail route.net slash TTS. You get 10% off for the lifetime of
[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:23.600]  your account lifetime. So if you're using them 10 years from now, you'll save, you'll still be saving
[02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:31.600]  10, 10%. So my thanks to them. The Shandling thing. Oh, Jason, that's it. I feel like this is,
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:36.000]  I feel like this is maybe like the rest of my life is all of a sudden people who start dying
[02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.840]  are like people who I cannot believe that they've died. And like a heart attack at 66 isn't exactly
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:45.760]  old age, but it is sort of, you know, it's the sort of thing that when I was a kid and they'd
[02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:50.960]  say some famous person died of a heart attack at 66 as a kid, I thought, wow, that's, you know,
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:56.880]  that's what happens when you get old. Sometimes people have heart attacks and die. Uh, I, I don't
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:01.040]  know if it's like, Shandling's too close in age to me though. It's like, it just seems like I'm
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:06.960]  at the age now where 66 is tragically young. Yeah. Well, I mean, that was what he and Jerry
[02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:12.000]  Seinfeld talked about in that comedians in cars getting coffee, right? Is like the only time they
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:18.400]  ever referred to being in your sixties as, as so young is when you die. But it's true. Like,
[02:33:18.400 --> 02:33:24.400]  and some of it is the older you get, the more you push off, like old age, right? It's like, no,
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:31.280]  40 isn't old, 50 isn't old, 60 isn't old, but also just human lifespans are increasing. Right. And,
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:38.560]  and our working lives are increasing. And so what was a retiree maybe when we were kids is now a
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:44.800]  more active kind of age today. So you look at him being 66 and yeah, I guess this is how life is
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:51.920]  going to be as you get older. All these people that you love are dying, but, um, but yeah,
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:59.600]  too, just too young. I was, I didn't have Showtime either. I did have cable though. So I was exposed
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:05.040]  to the it's Gary Shandling show on the Fox, which was slightly edited, I guess there were, you know,
[02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:11.280]  commercials and some, whatever, like if there were words or nudity or whatever, but yeah, me too.
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:16.960]  I, but I just, it spoke to me in a way that the only other person, you know, when you and I have
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:22.560]  spoken at length about our, our mutual love for David Letterman, um, it spoke to me in a way that
[02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:29.760]  only Letterman did in a way that he was playing with the form of TV. Uh, and it's a couple of the
[02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:35.840]  obituaries mentioned it, that he was just a master of television and in a way that like, I don't know
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:39.920]  if he ever considered, you know, like having a film career, although he did have, he was the,
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:48.000]  the Senator in the Iron Man too. Yeah. Right. Um, in a way that like the basic gist of show
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.400]  business was always, at least in our lifetimes, you know, in the late 20th century was TV was the
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:35:00.000]  B team and A in the feature films or the A team, you know, that's what you aspire to do. Um,
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:06.400]  and it's, Shandling is a guy who clearly, I mean, in Letterman too, cause remember they used to be
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.800]  talking about Letterman doing movies and Disney, you know, wanted to, uh, who was the CEO of Disney?
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:16.240]  Uh, Oh, uh, Michael Eisner. Michael Eisner really wanted to sign Letterman to a movie,
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:20.960]  uh, deal and Letterman was like, have you ever seen, you know, I I'm, I'm a terrible actor. You
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:24.560]  don't want to do this. And he's like, just let us give you the money. We'll just let us. And then
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:30.080]  like they dug up like Letterman's audition for airplane. Uh, and, and I was like, Holy shit,
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:37.040]  you're right. You're terrible. You're absolutely terrible. Um, Shandling is a guy who clearly it's
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:42.720]  like his genius was specific to TV. It would, it, it wouldn't have had any relevance to, to movies.
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:50.560]  It was TV as TV, not TV as movies on a small screen that the nature of television was such
[02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:57.440]  that he just, he mastered it in a way that it, it just blew me away as a kid. I was like,
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:03.040]  this is a guy who totally gets it. Well, like, like Letterman, he was present in this medium
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.440]  while he was like poking at all the, all the edges of it. And, and like, I mean,
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:12.960]  it's Carrie Shandling show broke my brain because it was a show that knew it was a TV show and
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:17.600]  characters knew they were characters on the TV show. It's just, what am I seeing here? Right.
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:23.840]  As a kid, as a whatever, 15, 16 year old kid, it was just baffling and brilliant. And in the
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:28.400]  same way, the Letterman was taking all of the, as we've talked about before all the conventions
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:37.040]  of talk shows and questioning why any of them existed. Right. Um, so it also really, it just
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.760]  blows my mind that he did it twice in quick succession where he had the, it's Gary Shandling
[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:48.800]  show, which, which was this sitcom, sitcom, you know, the, the sitcom is sitcom that's ever
[02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:56.960]  existed. Wacky Neighbor, the platonic friendship with a woman, uh, all of these tropes of the
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:01.840]  modern sitcom. And he just blew them all away by, by opening up the fourth wall and talking
[02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:05.920]  to the camera and talking to the audience and having the audience throw things at the characters.
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:14.400]  Um, and then two years later, coming back with another like meta, I mean, that's, that's the
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:21.360]  thing. He was the master of like this meta aspect of TV and doing meta in a totally opposite way
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:27.120]  where there's no breaking down to the fourth wall, but there was this weird fake talk show within
[02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.840]  the show that looked as it looked more like the tonight show than the tonight show did.
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:38.640]  Well, he hosted the tonight show. He was like before, before Jay Leno became the guest host.
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.560]  He was for, for years, he was like the permanent guest host of the tonight show. He would fill in
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:48.080]  for Johnny a lot. And I remember seeing him fill in for Johnny a lot. And, and so he knew that was
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.240]  the fascinating thing about Larry, the Larry Sanders show is that, um, the people who did
[02:37:52.240 --> 02:37:58.240]  that, especially Gary Shandling, he knew exactly how those shows worked. He knew the, he knew the
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:06.560]  hosts. Uh, he had been in consideration for the jobs. Right. I believe he was considered for
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:12.880]  to be David Letterman's replacement at one point. Um, so he had the offer, he was offered it and
[02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:17.920]  turned it down. I'm not quite sure if he was ever, I think that he had actually sort of stepped away
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:23.680]  from wanting to host, you know, do it full time so that he was never really like in the consideration
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:28.400]  like at the point where they needed to replace Johnny, he was already like, I'm out of it.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:33.440]  But I think you're exactly right though, that in the late eighties, you know, he was absolutely
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:38.400]  in consideration. Yeah. Um, and, and so he had all of that knowledge, right? He was,
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:45.280]  he was an insider. This was not, this was not somebody like, um, Aaron Sorkin doing studio 60
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:50.400]  on the sunset strip where he had sort of like a glancing blow at this, at this, uh, at this
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:57.040]  industry. Uh, but really was kind of imagining, uh, a fantasy version of it. This Larry Sanders
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:02.560]  was people who understood how the TV industry worked and how the talk shows worked making a
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:09.200]  show, uh, that was insidery on one level, but also kind of like at times just a scabrous
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:15.280]  commentary and satire of, of the, not just the show, but the guests. Right. And, and it was,
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.080]  it, it, you see the roots of so many things. It's, uh, the, the cringe comedy of things like
[02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:27.120]  the office come from this enthusiasm. Absolutely. Well, I mean, very Gary Shandling and Jerry
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:30.400]  Seinfeld really did. They, they did their shows across the lot from each other. They went and
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:34.560]  visited in that comedians with cars getting coffee episode. And so, so it, I think they influenced
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:39.040]  each other for, for, for Seinfeld. Um, definitely Ricky Gervais said that all of his stuff is just
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:42.800]  super influenced by Gary Shandling. And then something like 30 rock is another good example
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:47.120]  where 30 rock is absolutely, you know, would not exist if it weren't for Larry Sanders.
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:52.560]  Right. And took it, you know, totally in their own way and, and went like super fast paced
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.800]  and joke, joke, joke, joke, joke, which is, you know, the density of jokes on 30 rock just blows
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:06.000]  me away. Yeah. But, uh, you're right though. It's, you know, it's, it all sort of owes itself back
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:12.560]  to, to, uh, uh, Larry Sanders. It's, and it's amazing to me that he did those two shows like
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:19.280]  almost back to back. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's the, um, the hall of fame kind of thing where it's
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:23.600]  like, those are, those are Larry Sanders show is like in the hall of fame and you could make the
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:29.520]  argument for, for the, for it's Gary Shandling show too, before that, the idea that, that, um,
[02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.360]  when it's Gary Shandling show was going off the air, that that would be a footnote would seem
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:39.120]  impossible. And yet the next project was the thing that just kind of blew everybody away.
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:42.880]  I just remember him as a, he was a really great standup. I mean, I just remember how good he was
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:47.680]  as a standup, um, on the Letterman show, especially that, um, and you could tell,
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.760]  you could tell when Letterman, when it was somebody who he liked, like you could tell
[02:40:51.760 --> 02:40:54.000]  and they would, you would bring them over afterward and they would talk and they would
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:58.320]  do more comedy and they, they, and, and Shandling was definitely in that list. Like he was,
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:02.800]  he was, I've read a few obituaries that said that he was definitely like a comedian's comedian. Like
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:08.960]  they all, they all just were in awe of how good he was as a comedian. And he never really did
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:14.240]  anything after the Larry Sanders show. Um, I mean, um, you know, I mean, other than like,
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:18.480]  you know, guest appearances here and there, but he never had a major project, but by all accounts
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:22.320]  that I've read, especially, I've read it before, but now that, you know, he's dead and it's all
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:28.080]  coming out, but it really, it's just almost universal that he was very generous in giving
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:33.040]  to any, you know, the up and comers, like the Judd Apatow's and, and the people who are in
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:36.880]  their prime right now in comedy that he really was, you know, they could come to him with like,
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:40.720]  Hey, I'm working, you know, here's my script and I'm stuck here. Do you have any ideas? And,
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.800]  and would help them out in an industry that's notorious for having, you know,
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:51.280]  being filled with personalities that are, let's say less than generous. Yeah, exactly. People
[02:41:51.280 --> 02:41:56.000]  actually like liked him and thought he was a good guy. I think it's very telling that you never hear
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.160]  that about like Jay Leno. Nobody ever says, boy, Jay Leno really knows how to help out,
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:04.000]  help out an up and comer, you know? Chevy Chase, everybody loves Chevy Chase.
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:09.760]  Nobody ever says that or nobody ever says, boy, it's a real shame that something seems to be
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:15.360]  wrong with Chevy Chase these days. I get, I get that. Yeah. I don't know. I think about
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:21.600]  that sometimes. Like if you're, if you, if you're one of these TV stars who has a huge hit,
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:27.840]  and I think in the case of Larry Sanders, he owned a big piece of it too. Like this was before
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.960]  HBO made the deal. Like it's not on HBO. They're actually bringing it back to the HBO streaming
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:39.360]  service, but it went off because back in those days, HBO didn't buy like all rights to everything
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:44.880]  in perpetuity like they do now. But, um, so you make all this money, just insane TV money
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:49.440]  for being on a show for seven years. And then he had another six year show before that. And I,
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.760]  I always wondered like, what do you do? Some people, big stars and big successes, they,
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:57.840]  they react in different ways. Some people try to recapture it. Other people just kind of do
[02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:02.400]  passion projects. Other people just are like, I don't, I don't care. I'm gonna, I mean, I think
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:08.480]  Bill Murray is sort of in this catalog category too, where like he wants to work when he's moved
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:14.320]  to work, like when he finds something that for whatever reason interests him and, uh, he doesn't
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:20.160]  need to work. Right. And, and obviously for him, he's not a, he's not so obsessed with,
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:24.480]  with keeping busy that he always has to have a project. He's kind of okay. And I think Gary
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:29.440]  Shandling was kind of like that where he would pop in on the occasional thing. Like, and like,
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:34.240]  I would love to know the story of, of why he chose to do the Marvel movies, those, the
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:38.960]  Captain America and Iron Man movies. Like he was in a couple, he's a Senator, he's kind of a rotten
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:43.840]  Senator villain character. Right. Well, I don't know. I mean, it's a bit of a spoiler,
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:51.120]  but he ends up, he's, uh, he's a bad guy. I mean, he's a, he's a, he's a corrupt Senator.
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:55.520]  How, why did he decide that? And it was probably something like he knew somebody who was involved
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:59.840]  and thought it would be fun. And I had to guess, I don't know the story, but if I had to guess,
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:05.680]  I'll bet he was friends with Jon Favreau. That could be, because I think Jon Favreau is, I mean,
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.200]  he's more of a film, he's a filmmaker, not really a comic, but I think he's in with, you know,
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:13.840]  I wouldn't be surprised if he's in the same pack of guys, you know, like, uh, like Judd Apatow,
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:19.280]  who are pals. I'll bet it's through Jon Favreau. Yeah. And so it looks to me like after he finished
[02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:24.560]  he, Larry Sanders, he was pretty much happy to just kind of, uh, mess around when he wanted to
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:28.960]  and not worry about it otherwise. And, you know, when you've got, I think that's a question that
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:32.720]  most of us will never have to deal with in our life, but it, but it is that question of like,
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:38.080]  if you won the lottery or something you created became a wild success and you literally didn't
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:43.040]  have to work again, what would you do? And would you just go to an Island and sit out in the sun
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:47.120]  all day? Or would you work because you want to work and pretend that you don't have that money?
[02:44:47.120 --> 02:44:50.800]  Or would you kind of find a way to compromise where, you know, you weren't going to work too
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:56.400]  hard, but you'd be, you want to kind of keep in the game a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. You know,
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:01.680]  and just to touch on one other thing that you, with the HBO deal, it's in addition to the fact
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:06.960]  that the Larry Sanders show in and of itself stands up as a tremendous body of work. I've
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:11.040]  watched the whole thing through at least three times, at least three. And now that he's dead,
[02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:16.320]  I think I'm itching to do it again. I'm going to do it once it's on HBO. Yeah. I'm going to wait
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:22.320]  for it to be on HBO. Um, uh, I say three times, but I think a lot of the time I've done it,
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:26.480]  especially when it was original, I couldn't stream it. So it's like you either caught it or you
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:30.320]  didn't. And so, you know, I may not have hit, I was like watching it when I was home when it was
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:35.520]  on, but I, you know, I might've missed episodes. Um, and at least once those in the digital era,
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:40.000]  I've watched the whole thing, but it's the fact that it even that there even are shows that we
[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:46.640]  think of HBO as a network that has shows is in large part driven by, or originated by the Larry
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:51.920]  Sanders show. Like that's what we think of HBO now primarily, but at the time HBO was where you went
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:57.280]  to watch movies and then sometimes they'd have shows, but a lot of their shows were things like
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:04.000]  Bryant Gumbel sports thing. They weren't like, uh, original fiction, you know? Yeah. Their,
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.560]  their strategy has changed pretty dramatically. And that's, and then as part of that, then they,
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:11.920]  they, they locked up all the rights. Like they, they produce all their own shows. They own the
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:17.520]  rights to them. They're all, you know, that's why the wire is on HBO. Like it will always be on HBO
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:22.960]  and the sopranos and six exactly. Exactly. So Larry Sanders was predates that time,
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:27.840]  but they, it's cool. Like before he died, they were, Gary Shandling had made a deal with HBO
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:33.280]  to bring Larry Sanders back onto HBO and onto HBO streaming. So it will get there eventually.
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:38.560]  And then I, it's a shame that they can't, I hope they're like rushing to get it on because, um,
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:43.200]  I think we would all love to, to, uh, go back and watch that stuff again. Yeah. Feel better about
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:48.000]  it. Well, the other part, you know, and the other genius aspect to it was that he had the foresight
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.440]  at a time when standup comedians, the goal was to get a network sitcom. Uh, his goal, he saw like
[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:57.680]  past that and he was like, if I could, you know, I can do something on Showtime or HBO that you
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.800]  can't do on the networks. You know, like I think it was less about the money and the fame and a
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:08.480]  little bit more about, uh, not to be pretentious, but the artistic integrity, you know, of doing
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:16.480]  something that you couldn't get on network TV and avoiding the, uh, you know, the, the, the annoyance
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.240]  of the commercial interruptions. I mean, even though he did have it, he, you know, he let the
[02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:24.480]  show, the one show beyond Fox, which was, I don't know, I don't know what the backstory is on that,
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:30.080]  but, but especially with Larry Sanders that he saw that, that, you know, it wasn't like, well,
[02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:34.400]  I can't get a network show, but I'll, you know, I'll do an HBO show. It's like, clearly he saw HBO
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:41.760]  as a way to do something that he couldn't do on a, on a network. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, it's, uh,
[02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:47.520]  it's sad. And, and for the people who know him, it's, you know, it's really tragic for the rest
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:54.000]  of us. The good thing to come out of something terrible like this is I do really, um, I like
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.760]  that so many people have come out to appreciate his talent and his work because, you know, that's,
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.080]  I think that's all that any of us could ask for is, is when we go that somebody says, wow, that,
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:08.800]  that, I like that person. They did a great job. They were brilliant. I'm going to miss them. And
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:13.280]  I definitely feel that way about, about Shandling and also celebrating his work. I mean, that's,
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:18.560]  that's why I want that stuff back on HBO go is that I want to, I want to go back and appreciate
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:24.160]  his work. I did watch that comedians in cars getting coffee again, uh, yesterday for the
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:29.680]  same thing. It's like, let me know that now that he's, he's gone, you know, it's worth reminding
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:36.080]  ourselves how, how great he was when he was here. All right, Jason, thank you so much for generous
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:41.760]  use of your time. I'm happy to, as always, always enjoy having you on the show. Always enjoy your
[02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:48.720]  insights. Um, uh, I won't see you again until probably WWDC. Yeah, I know we always run into
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:52.640]  each other at these weird, weird events. One of these days, I'll actually just sort of be in
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.960]  Philadelphia for no reason. I'll say, Hey, John, but, uh, but yeah, it was good to see you this
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:03.280]  week too. Yeah. Uh, thanks to all the sponsors and you can get as much Jason's now as you
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:13.600]  would ever want on a six colors dot com, six colors dot, uh, with the, you could even put a
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:20.400]  U in it if you're in Canada or the UK. Yeah. Um, you, do you do any other podcasts? No,
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:26.160]  not really. A podcasting is a, yeah, you can find many podcasts by me at the incomparable.com and
[02:49:26.160 --> 02:49:31.440]  at relay.fm. Um, I, I did the math the other day and I don't even want to tell you what I realized,
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:34.960]  how many podcasts I do in a week on average, it's too many is the answer too many,
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.960]  but I'll tell you, you've gotten good at it though. Well, this week we got, uh,
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:45.440]  the Atlantic did this big feature about what a robot is. And then it quotes from John Syracuse
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:50.720]  says in my, uh, podcast robot or not at length. And I just thought, you know, I'm going to be
[02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:56.400]  really mad if the thing that I'm remembered for is robot or not. It's like, not my life's work.
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:02.080]  So, Hey, let me ask you, Liam, is Liam a robot? Uh, you got to ask Syracuse. I would say,
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:07.920]  I would say he's probably not, um, because it's more like, uh, Syracuse's definition of robot is
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:12.320]  very narrow, which is that it needs to sort of have some, uh, it's got to sort of do some self
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:16.720]  evaluation itself. So like a Roomba, you just press the button and it kind of figures out what
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:22.080]  to do. Um, but he, he doesn't think like a, uh, an automotive assembly line robot is really a robot.
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:26.160]  He thinks it's just pro programmed equipment. And so he would say, he would say no,
[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:50.160]  but he is a very strict, uh, robot definer.
[02:50:56.160 --> 02:51:08.160]  Yeah.
