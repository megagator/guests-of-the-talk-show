[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  I had never seen Blazing Saddles and I had never seen Caddyshack and a friend of mine,
[00:11.600 --> 00:17.120]  every Friday, I go out for a beer at this German beer house in Redwood City with a couple
[00:17.120 --> 00:18.460]  of my friends.
[00:18.460 --> 00:24.400]  So they were sitting down making references to these movies and I said, I don't know what
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.400]  you're talking about.
[00:25.400 --> 00:27.840]  He said, well, it's Caddyshack and Blazing Saddles.
[00:27.840 --> 00:30.600]  I said, yeah, I've never seen them.
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.380]  And they were so upset.
[00:32.380 --> 00:35.560]  They said, you Canadians, you don't know anything.
[00:35.560 --> 00:39.040]  He said, we're coming over tomorrow and we're going to watch.
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.720]  And they did, they came over, we grilled up some food and sat down and watched both of
[00:44.720 --> 00:49.280]  the movies and they would never be able to make Blazing Saddles today.
[00:49.280 --> 00:50.280]  Never.
[00:50.280 --> 00:51.280]  No.
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.040]  Well, I was stunned by it.
[00:53.040 --> 00:57.760]  You know, by pure coincidence, unplanned, I got a new t-shirt this summer, a new novelty
[00:57.760 --> 00:58.760]  t-shirt.
[00:58.760 --> 01:02.860]  It's, uh, it's, it's, uh, you ever heard of Callaway golf?
[01:02.860 --> 01:07.320]  It's like a, you know, so it's, it's like a written in the font and the logo like Callaway
[01:07.320 --> 01:15.200]  golf, but instead of saying Callaway, it says Gunga, Galunga, which of course is, is what
[01:15.200 --> 01:21.400]  the Dalai Lama told Carl the groundskeeper after stiffing them on it, you know, you get
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.400]  total enlightenment.
[01:22.400 --> 01:23.880]  So I've got that going for me.
[01:23.880 --> 01:26.560]  Well, I'm not going for you.
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.400]  Uh, yeah, amazing, amazing news.
[01:30.400 --> 01:33.320]  The other one you probably haven't seen is the producers.
[01:33.320 --> 01:34.720]  Have you seen the producers?
[01:34.720 --> 01:35.860]  I have not.
[01:35.860 --> 01:40.200]  So that's Mel Brooks is, uh, I forget, I think it was made in like 1967.
[01:40.200 --> 01:41.200]  It was on Broadway.
[01:41.200 --> 01:42.200]  Then it came back on Broadway.
[01:42.200 --> 01:48.780]  Anyway, I was watching, uh, Jerry Seinfeld's comedians and cars getting coffee and Matthew
[01:48.780 --> 01:55.400]  Broderick was his guest and Matthew Broderick starred on the, I forget if it was 10 years
[01:55.400 --> 02:01.080]  ago or when they went back on Broadway, um, starred in it and they were talking about
[02:01.080 --> 02:05.080]  how that movie could never be made again now.
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.780]  So the, the basic gist is it's been a while since I saw it, but basically there's two
[02:11.780 --> 02:17.680]  producers on Broadway who want to make a failure.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.000]  And so they, they, I forget why, but they have some kind of financial incentive to,
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.600]  to make a bomb.
[02:23.600 --> 02:31.440]  And so they make them, they make a, and they make a musical about Nazi Germany and it turns
[02:31.440 --> 02:34.580]  in, it accidentally turns into a hit.
[02:34.580 --> 02:42.100]  And so it's basically a comedy about Hitler that they made in like Seinfeld said, like
[02:42.100 --> 02:46.620]  that was only like 20 years after the end of world war II and they're, they're making
[02:46.620 --> 02:48.580]  a comedy about Hitler.
[02:48.580 --> 02:54.560]  Like that would be like today, roughly making a comedy about nine 11, you know?
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.600]  I mean, it's not quite 20 years since nine 11, but you know, it's in the ballpark like
[02:58.600 --> 03:01.040]  a comedy about nine 11 would not fly today.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.400]  It just wouldn't would not fly.
[03:02.400 --> 03:03.400]  Right.
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.480]  And whereas people just had a sort of a stiffer backbone back then and they could, they could
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.480]  take a joke.
[03:08.480 --> 03:12.960]  Well, I mean, these were some pretty harsh strokes.
[03:12.960 --> 03:17.280]  If you like blazing saddles, if you like blazing saddles, I'm telling you right now, you should,
[03:17.280 --> 03:21.840]  you should like load up on Mel Brooks movies, but I totally recommend that the produce the
[03:21.840 --> 03:22.840]  producers.
[03:22.840 --> 03:23.840]  Okay.
[03:23.840 --> 03:28.540]  I think the movie version has, it's somewhat, I don't know, just, just, just rent it.
[03:28.540 --> 03:30.080]  You're going to love it.
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.800]  These guys were, were literally, they were, they were saying the lines as the people were
[03:34.800 --> 03:40.300]  saying the lines in the movie and, and then just like almost falling off the coach.
[03:40.300 --> 03:44.540]  They were laughing so hard and you know, I'm hearing them for the first time.
[03:44.540 --> 03:47.540]  So I was laughing, but not like they were.
[03:47.540 --> 03:54.200]  So I find it so I don't understand people that talk in, in movie lingo anyway, I find
[03:54.200 --> 03:55.200]  it so hard to believe.
[03:55.200 --> 03:57.800]  You never saw a Caddyshack of all movies.
[03:57.800 --> 03:59.880]  Caddyshack never saw it.
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.440]  I can't believe it.
[04:01.440 --> 04:02.440]  Anyway.
[04:02.440 --> 04:04.080]  Uh, Jim, it's good to talk to you again.
[04:04.080 --> 04:05.840]  I guess you haven't been on my show in a while.
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.600]  I know I was on your show at, uh, at WWDC.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.600]  Good to talk to you again.
[04:10.600 --> 04:12.720]  How's your, how's your summer going?
[04:12.720 --> 04:13.840]  Summer is going very well.
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.680]  It's been, uh, it's been pretty quiet to be honest at, but I kind of liked that.
[04:18.680 --> 04:25.840]  I, I took some, uh, time, uh, so a friend of mine has a cabin.
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.240]  I put that in air quotes and, uh, in, in Tahoe.
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.780]  And, uh, so he invited me up and said, do you want to come to my cabin?
[04:36.780 --> 04:41.400]  And I thought, geez, okay, you know, I'm gonna sleep on the floor.
[04:41.400 --> 04:46.760]  You know, you don't want to ask, but, um, so I said, okay, fine, you know, let's go.
[04:46.760 --> 04:51.920]  And then I found out that he invited like 10 other guys from the bar that we all go
[04:51.920 --> 04:52.920]  to.
[04:52.920 --> 04:53.920]  Right.
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.920]  And I thought, wow.
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.820]  I mean, what the hell is going on?
[04:57.820 --> 05:00.920]  So are we all hop, you know, we had several different cars.
[05:00.920 --> 05:05.040]  We all hop in cars and we go up for like, that's about a three hour drive as I recall.
[05:05.040 --> 05:11.220]  Uh, yeah, a little bit more, um, but you know, we all hopped in cars and you know, we had
[05:11.220 --> 05:15.560]  this convoy going up to his quote unquote cabin.
[05:15.560 --> 05:25.120]  So I arrived to this mansion and you know, it's on the water on Lake Tahoe, this gigantic
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.120]  house.
[05:26.120 --> 05:31.420]  And here I was worried about, you know, gourmet kitchen, you know, all of this kind of stuff.
[05:31.420 --> 05:35.440]  So, and then he had just bought a new boat.
[05:35.440 --> 05:41.000]  So we went out, you know, wake surfing and I didn't, but, uh, they, they did.
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.560]  I sat at the back of the boat to give them lots of weight on the back so that they had
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.560]  better, better, uh, waves back there and then slowly, slowly, but surely reduce the weight
[05:50.560 --> 05:55.520]  as you, it was, it was fun.
[05:55.520 --> 05:59.040]  It was a lot of fun, but actually now that I think about it, as you empty it, as you
[05:59.040 --> 06:02.280]  empty Heineken's, you're not really reducing the weight, you're just transferring the weight
[06:02.280 --> 06:03.280]  from the bottles.
[06:03.280 --> 06:04.280]  Yeah.
[06:04.280 --> 06:06.200]  Well we had, we had lots of Heineken on there too.
[06:06.200 --> 06:11.280]  So everybody, everybody had a good laugh at the look on my face when we arrived on their
[06:11.280 --> 06:12.280]  house.
[06:12.280 --> 06:16.040]  Cause of course they all knew cause they had been there before, but they had a good, good
[06:16.040 --> 06:18.040]  laugh at me.
[06:18.040 --> 06:22.040]  Worried that you were going to be sleeping on the splintered boards.
[06:22.040 --> 06:23.040]  Right.
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.040]  Yeah.
[06:24.040 --> 06:25.360]  No, it wasn't like that at all.
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.280]  Everybody had a room and it was, yeah, it was nice.
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.280]  I've been to Tahoe.
[06:30.280 --> 06:31.280]  How about you?
[06:31.280 --> 06:32.280]  How was your summer?
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.280]  Good.
[06:33.280 --> 06:34.280]  Good.
[06:34.280 --> 06:35.280]  That's all I'll say.
[06:35.280 --> 06:38.800]  It's been fine.
[06:38.800 --> 06:39.800]  Jonas is still here.
[06:39.800 --> 06:42.000]  Jonas's school doesn't start up till after Labor Day.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  I don't get it.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.760]  I know that all around the country it's like his school is obviously an aberration.
[06:46.760 --> 06:49.440]  It's like a lot of kids are back in school already.
[06:49.440 --> 06:52.040]  I don't get that.
[06:52.040 --> 06:53.040]  Call me a traditionalist.
[06:53.040 --> 06:56.160]  I don't think school should start till after Labor Day and I don't get it either because
[06:56.160 --> 07:00.400]  these schools, like my sister's kids started school last week and they still, they don't
[07:00.400 --> 07:01.740]  get out till June anyway.
[07:01.740 --> 07:02.940]  They still don't get out till June.
[07:02.940 --> 07:05.440]  So I don't even understand it.
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.220]  We always started in Canada.
[07:07.220 --> 07:08.760]  We always started after Labor Day.
[07:08.760 --> 07:09.760]  Yeah.
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.760]  After Labor Day.
[07:10.760 --> 07:11.760]  I don't, I don't get it.
[07:11.760 --> 07:12.760]  I'm against it.
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.200]  If, uh, if I were running for president, that would be one of my campaign points.
[07:17.200 --> 07:19.920]  No school till after Labor Day.
[07:19.920 --> 07:21.720]  I agree with you.
[07:21.720 --> 07:25.840]  Tuesday after Labor Day, you wait till Labor Day and then the next day you go back to school.
[07:25.840 --> 07:26.840]  Right.
[07:26.840 --> 07:27.840]  Boom.
[07:27.840 --> 07:30.280]  And then you have a holiday short week.
[07:30.280 --> 07:32.960]  This shit going into school in August.
[07:32.960 --> 07:33.960]  That's nonsense.
[07:33.960 --> 07:34.960]  Anyway.
[07:34.960 --> 07:40.640]  Well, if they were going to do something like that, I could see that in the, um, uh, the
[07:40.640 --> 07:44.760]  East coast where there's snow and you have snow days and you have to make up for some
[07:44.760 --> 07:45.760]  of that.
[07:45.760 --> 07:46.920]  But they do that in California.
[07:46.920 --> 07:50.720]  They go, what kind of days do they have?
[07:50.720 --> 07:51.720]  I don't get it.
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.720]  Snow days.
[07:52.720 --> 07:54.480]  I don't get it.
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.640]  Although you would think it by looking at the way that people dress in California.
[07:57.640 --> 08:03.440]  I mean, I walk outside here and people are in big winter coats and hats and mitts and
[08:03.440 --> 08:05.480]  I'm in a t-shirt.
[08:05.480 --> 08:09.440]  We go to Disney, you know, a couple of times a year and we've already, we've gone in December
[08:09.440 --> 08:10.640]  down in Orlando.
[08:10.640 --> 08:17.360]  Uh, and it's comical because, uh, uh, you go in December or maybe I think we've gone
[08:17.360 --> 08:18.360]  in January too.
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.760]  You know, it's a bit in the winter and they have like all the Christmas decorations up.
[08:21.760 --> 08:22.760]  It looks real nice.
[08:22.760 --> 08:27.480]  And it, you know, it gets down to like the fifties at night and you know, it's like
[08:27.480 --> 08:29.280]  sixties in the daytime.
[08:29.280 --> 08:31.560]  Uh, and we're like luxuriating.
[08:31.560 --> 08:36.040]  We're like a break from the East coast and we're like wearing shorts, you know, maybe
[08:36.040 --> 08:39.600]  you have like a hoodie on or something, but I'm wearing shorts and you get there and there's
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.240]  like the, the employees who are, you live there year round, they've got like parkas
[08:43.240 --> 08:45.240]  on.
[08:45.240 --> 08:48.000]  Yeah.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.680]  They're trying to put you inside by a fire.
[08:49.680 --> 08:51.320]  No, I'm gonna sit outside.
[08:51.320 --> 08:53.600]  They've got like a parka and they're like rubbing their arms.
[08:53.600 --> 08:56.760]  It's like, you can't take, you know, like once you, once you go to a good climate, you
[08:56.760 --> 08:57.760]  lose it.
[08:57.760 --> 09:01.640]  Your, your blood loses its ability to, to, to take the fifties.
[09:01.640 --> 09:02.640]  It's true.
[09:02.640 --> 09:05.200]  Do you ever hear of a place called snap kitchen, Jim?
[09:05.200 --> 09:06.200]  No,
[09:06.200 --> 09:09.560]  I don't know how widespread or how national it's a chain.
[09:09.560 --> 09:12.560]  We've got one here, here in Philadelphia, I'm, I'm in love with the place.
[09:12.560 --> 09:15.880]  So what you do is you go into snap kitchen, this is not a sponsor.
[09:15.880 --> 09:20.120]  I'm just doing this, uh, uh, just as it's a testimonial.
[09:20.120 --> 09:26.740]  So you go into snap kitchen and uh, they've got like pre-made meals, but they're not frozen.
[09:26.740 --> 09:27.740]  They're just like refrigerated.
[09:27.740 --> 09:32.160]  So you gotta, you gotta cook them up, you know, within like two or three days, but they
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.200]  tell you exactly how many calories are in them.
[09:34.200 --> 09:36.920]  So I think it's popular with people who are like calorie counting.
[09:36.920 --> 09:41.440]  Like they'll tell you it's exactly, you know, 390 calories or something like that, but it's
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.000]  really good and I have fallen in love.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.320]  I'm not a big breakfast eater.
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.320]  Are you a breakfast eater?
[09:48.320 --> 09:50.760]  Not some, I mean, I'm more coffee for me.
[09:50.760 --> 09:52.640]  I have a coffee.
[09:52.640 --> 09:56.420]  But I like, I like something and they've got this thing.
[09:56.420 --> 10:01.560]  I have fallen in love with, they call them a red pepper, egg bites, two little egg, two
[10:01.560 --> 10:05.560]  little, uh, almost like, I don't know, I guess they put them in like little, almost like
[10:05.560 --> 10:11.720]  a, they must cook them in like a little, uh, like a cupcake type thing, you know, hard
[10:11.720 --> 10:12.720]  boiled eggs.
[10:12.720 --> 10:13.720]  No, no, no.
[10:13.720 --> 10:17.000]  They're two little puffs about the size of a golf ball each.
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.700]  Speaking of caddy shack, two little things about the size of a golf ball, the only, there's
[10:21.700 --> 10:28.000]  only three ingredients, eggs, red peppers, and onions, uh, sort of like a scrambled egg
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.620]  with red peppers and onions, uh, two of them, 90 calories.
[10:32.620 --> 10:35.800]  So it's not a lot of food, but this, that's like my breakfast.
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.920]  Like I eat 90 calories and I'm full, put them into microwave for 30 seconds.
[10:39.920 --> 10:40.920]  They're perfect.
[10:40.920 --> 10:41.920]  They're nice and hot.
[10:41.920 --> 10:44.320]  They taste like something that was just freshly cooked.
[10:44.320 --> 10:46.200]  I am addicted to these things.
[10:46.200 --> 10:47.200]  I love this place.
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.500]  It's, and they have all sorts of other food, like all sorts of meals throughout the day.
[10:50.500 --> 10:52.960]  But man, I love the place.
[10:52.960 --> 11:01.320]  Snap kitchen, red devil, red pepper, red, no, no, I just, I had a red pepper eggs.
[11:01.320 --> 11:02.920]  I don't know.
[11:02.920 --> 11:05.640]  Anyway, anybody out there has a snap kitchen nearby.
[11:05.640 --> 11:08.360]  I recommend you go in there and try it and just look around.
[11:08.360 --> 11:09.360]  Snap kitchen.
[11:09.360 --> 11:12.200]  These are chefs that just cook up.
[11:12.200 --> 11:17.400]  You order different meals or they just send you, you walk in and they're all on shelves.
[11:17.400 --> 11:18.400]  You know what I mean?
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.320]  It's all pre-packaged like in a little cardboard container, you know, with like a thing on
[11:22.320 --> 11:23.320]  top.
[11:23.320 --> 11:27.240]  It's all, you know, not chefs, it's, but you know, it's, I've never really seen anything
[11:27.240 --> 11:28.240]  like it.
[11:28.240 --> 11:30.360]  It's not really a grocery store because they don't really have other things.
[11:30.360 --> 11:34.800]  It's actually pretty small square footage, but it's just all of these pre-made meals,
[11:34.800 --> 11:35.800]  but they're not frozen.
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.280]  You know, it's, you know, the sort of stuff you would expect to be frozen, but instead
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.080]  of being frozen, it's all relatively fresh and therefore you have to, you know, and you
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.080]  know, everything has a little sticker on it, like, you know, eat this by August 27th or
[11:50.080 --> 11:52.480]  whatever the hell the date will be.
[11:52.480 --> 11:54.400]  But anyway, these red pepper egg bites.
[11:54.400 --> 11:55.400]  Amazing.
[11:55.400 --> 11:57.120]  They have a couple of things for breakfast that I really like.
[11:57.120 --> 12:00.040]  They've got like a sausage and egg thing.
[12:00.040 --> 12:01.040]  But I get that.
[12:01.040 --> 12:02.040]  I would eat that.
[12:02.040 --> 12:03.600]  See, when I get that, I don't need it for breakfast though.
[12:03.600 --> 12:08.520]  I'll eat that like as like, like a late lunch or something like that because it's, it's,
[12:08.520 --> 12:10.320]  you know, more food.
[12:10.320 --> 12:16.080]  I could definitely go for the, uh, uh, for the breakfast sandwich if I'm going to do
[12:16.080 --> 12:17.080]  something.
[12:17.080 --> 12:19.260]  Oh, and they do have a breakfast sandwich and they've, you know, and they, you know,
[12:19.260 --> 12:20.260]  they're trying to be healthy.
[12:20.260 --> 12:24.800]  So they've got some stuff like, like, uh, you know, they, a lot of the stuff is, uh,
[12:24.800 --> 12:26.560]  made with Turkey instead of pork.
[12:26.560 --> 12:27.560]  You know what I mean?
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.720]  Like Turkey bacon or Turkey sausage or something like that.
[12:29.720 --> 12:35.140]  And they've got, uh, you know, it, it, it's mixed and matched, but, uh, you know, uh,
[12:35.140 --> 12:36.140]  what else do they do?
[12:36.140 --> 12:41.440]  They've got like a sausage sandwich where the, uh, the biscuit is made at least partially
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.240]  with cauliflower, but you know, it doesn't really, you know, I like cauliflower, cauliflower
[12:46.240 --> 12:47.880]  doesn't really have a taste in my opinion.
[12:47.880 --> 12:51.560]  I know what you mean, but it's, it doesn't taste like that though.
[12:51.560 --> 12:54.200]  It's just, you know, just tastes like a biscuit.
[12:54.200 --> 13:00.680]  You know, what gets me is when I go to, to, you know, somebody's house for a supper and
[13:00.680 --> 13:07.200]  I think that there's mashed potatoes when I get it to the table, it's not, it's cauliflower.
[13:07.200 --> 13:09.800]  Like, uh, come on, don't trick me.
[13:09.800 --> 13:10.960]  Don't try and trick me.
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.920]  And now I've got a plate full of cauliflower when I thought they were mashed potatoes.
[13:15.920 --> 13:16.920]  That's just wrong.
[13:16.920 --> 13:19.560]  That's wrong to do to somebody.
[13:19.560 --> 13:22.600]  Did you, uh, did you see net news wire five shipped?
[13:22.600 --> 13:24.800]  I did very high.
[13:24.800 --> 13:28.120]  I love net news wire five years in the making.
[13:28.120 --> 13:29.120]  Yeah.
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.920]  I think it's, you know, that's one of those apps that we've all used and for a long time,
[13:34.920 --> 13:38.360]  like BB edit, you know, we have just, we've all used it.
[13:38.360 --> 13:39.360]  Yeah.
[13:39.360 --> 13:49.360]  But the difference is so BB edit has been on a steady course nonstop since 1991 or 92
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.760]  or so.
[13:50.760 --> 13:57.600]  And as you know, under rich Segal's, you know, development and, and his colleague from the
[13:57.600 --> 14:00.880]  beginning, Patrick Woolsey, uh, and others.
[14:00.880 --> 14:08.120]  Uh, but you know, rich and Patrick have been a team literally since 1992, uh, and I've
[14:08.120 --> 14:09.720]  never really looked up.
[14:09.720 --> 14:16.960]  Net news wire has sort of had a, uh, I wouldn't say Rocky, but a tumultuous, tumultuous would
[14:16.960 --> 14:22.520]  be the word history where, where my dear friend, my good friend Brent Simmons developed it.
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.680]  I think he, I think it launched 17 years ago.
[14:24.680 --> 14:34.800]  Uh, yeah, it was like 2002, um, same year that during fireball launched, um, and became
[14:34.800 --> 14:35.800]  a hit.
[14:35.800 --> 14:36.880]  It was a commercial product.
[14:36.880 --> 14:42.840]  I think he sold it for 20 or $25, uh, you know, support, you know, became his, his full
[14:42.840 --> 14:44.720]  time job.
[14:44.720 --> 14:50.880]  And then, uh, I forget when he sold it, but at some point, seven, eight years in, he sold
[14:50.880 --> 14:57.560]  it and went to work for the company that bought it and, um, then moved on to other things
[14:57.560 --> 15:03.960]  within the company doing like a, uh, sort of a Slack like thing called glassboard for
[15:03.960 --> 15:04.960]  them.
[15:04.960 --> 15:07.320]  I don't know if you remember glassboard, but it's pretty useful.
[15:07.320 --> 15:10.960]  I still miss it in some ways compared to Slack.
[15:10.960 --> 15:18.060]  Um, and then they sold it to black pixel, uh, sort of a, well, you know, well known
[15:18.060 --> 15:25.080]  Mac developers, iOS developers, but you know, they're, they're bread and butter is consulting
[15:25.080 --> 15:26.080]  work.
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.960]  Uh, and so net news wire sort of fell by the wayside under their ownership.
[15:32.960 --> 15:40.360]  And then Brent five years ago started working on a new RSS reader on his own on the side.
[15:40.360 --> 15:45.780]  He now, you know, Brent, Brent and I, you know, worked for a while together on, on Vesper
[15:45.780 --> 15:48.320]  with our friend Dave Whiskas.
[15:48.320 --> 15:53.960]  And then I guess after that, it was after Vesper, you know, sort of ceased development
[15:53.960 --> 15:56.120]  that he started working.
[15:56.120 --> 15:57.120]  What do you call it?
[15:57.120 --> 16:03.520]  Evergreen was what he was calling it, uh, his new RSS reader, just because, you know,
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.360]  he just, he just realized, I mean, I don't want to put words in Brent's mouth.
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.800]  I should probably have him on the show, but basically, you know, in his bones, he still
[16:10.800 --> 16:17.080]  loved RSS, still wanted, still felt like there wasn't a Mac RSS reader that did things the
[16:17.080 --> 16:19.160]  way he wanted it to be done.
[16:19.160 --> 16:24.120]  And instead of doing it commercially, cause now Brent works at the Omni group, um, but
[16:24.120 --> 16:29.120]  not as a developer, he's like a head of product marketing and does sort of developer relations.
[16:29.120 --> 16:34.440]  Um, and then on the side to scratch his development itch is it was, had been developing this RSS
[16:34.440 --> 16:35.800]  reader at open source.
[16:35.800 --> 16:44.480]  Uh, and then about a year ago, uh, black pixel, he and black pixel negotiated and black pixel
[16:44.480 --> 16:47.400]  was like, you know what hair, we're not doing anything with it.
[16:47.400 --> 16:53.200]  Take the net news wire name back and effectively just gave it to Brent, uh, which I think was
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.200]  very cool.
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.200]  That's classy.
[16:55.200 --> 16:56.200]  Yeah.
[16:56.200 --> 17:02.360]  And I think it's, you know, it sort of speaks to the way the, the Apple developer community
[17:02.360 --> 17:06.400]  has always worked where there's sort of a lot of stuff just gets done with a handshake
[17:06.400 --> 17:09.880]  and just full of good people.
[17:09.880 --> 17:10.880]  But it's right.
[17:10.880 --> 17:11.880]  You know what I mean?
[17:11.880 --> 17:19.120]  Like it just fits this app like a glove, like this is where net news wire should be in 2019.
[17:19.120 --> 17:22.840]  Um, and Brent, you know, I love him to death.
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.880]  He's a great developer and a very dear friend, but he's got some very funny ideas about like
[17:27.880 --> 17:36.520]  what alpha and beta mean like, and then, you know, a lot of developers do, you know, like,
[17:36.520 --> 17:45.480]  uh, I sort of feel like Apple has sort of the, uh, Apple's take on what's beta is sort
[17:45.480 --> 17:52.280]  of canonical, you know, like beta is buggy and features come and go, you know, like since
[17:52.280 --> 17:59.800]  WWDC, there've been new features that have been added to the iOS and MacOS betas.
[17:59.800 --> 18:03.280]  And there've been, there are a lot of bugs in June and July.
[18:03.280 --> 18:05.480]  It feels, you know, I'm going to get into it on this show.
[18:05.480 --> 18:11.360]  We have other things to talk about, but it feels like as of mid August, the latest beta,
[18:11.360 --> 18:16.800]  at least for iOS has really, really taken a step up towards shipability in terms of
[18:16.800 --> 18:22.320]  reversing a lot of bugs because I've got it right, I still don't have it on my main phone,
[18:22.320 --> 18:27.800]  but I've got it on my year old iPhone 10 and a lot of the problems I was seeing before
[18:27.800 --> 18:28.800]  are gone.
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.320]  You know, that's beta, but in, in Brent's mind, that's alpha everything.
[18:33.320 --> 18:40.320]  What most people consider beta is alpha and what he considers beta is feature complete
[18:40.320 --> 18:44.640]  and that the only things missing are things like documentation.
[18:44.640 --> 18:51.360]  So it's been in beta for a while, but his, the net news wire five betas are, were more
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.760]  stable and more reliable than most non-beta software.
[18:56.760 --> 19:05.780]  But anyway, as of today, August 26, it is shipped, it is non-beta and I couldn't be
[19:05.780 --> 19:09.240]  happier for him and I just, I have to write about it on daring fireball.
[19:09.240 --> 19:14.600]  I just feel like I want to hold this up as the, this is what a Mac modern Mac app should
[19:14.600 --> 19:22.440]  be in 2019 it looks modern it, it just looks everything like what a Mac app today should
[19:22.440 --> 19:23.440]  look like.
[19:23.440 --> 19:28.960]  It's scriptable, it has a full help book, so you go to the help menu and you ever go
[19:28.960 --> 19:32.760]  to the help menu and a Mac app and you're like, I want to look this up and you go and
[19:32.760 --> 19:35.720]  there is a help menu and you go help, help for this app.
[19:35.720 --> 19:38.720]  And then you get a dialogue box that say help is not available for this.
[19:38.720 --> 19:48.080]  You know what I mean, it's like, why don't, why, why even have just a fucking delete the
[19:48.080 --> 19:49.080]  menu?
[19:49.080 --> 19:50.080]  You know what I mean?
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.080]  But he's got a full help book.
[19:51.080 --> 19:55.660]  It, like I said, it's scriptable, um, you know, there's all sorts of features he wants
[19:55.660 --> 19:56.660]  to add.
[19:56.660 --> 20:01.800]  I know the number one thing is that for sinking between other feed readers, like on, cause
[20:01.800 --> 20:03.420]  there's no companion iOS app.
[20:03.420 --> 20:07.680]  He's the only right now in that newswire only sinks to a service called feed bin, which
[20:07.680 --> 20:13.280]  actually that's the one I use well and that I didn't, I would have voted for feed bin.
[20:13.280 --> 20:17.640]  I didn't get a vote, but that is actually a, it's an outstanding sync service.
[20:17.640 --> 20:18.840]  I forget what you pay for it.
[20:18.840 --> 20:20.920]  It's a very, very reasonable cost.
[20:20.920 --> 20:27.240]  It's cheap, very reasonable, super reliable, but, but having third party sync services
[20:27.240 --> 20:30.760]  for RSS, it's, it's very similar to email, right?
[20:30.760 --> 20:34.820]  Where, where it doesn't really matter who your email provider is.
[20:34.820 --> 20:39.120]  You can use whatever email client you want and you just give your credentials and your
[20:39.120 --> 20:40.120]  email comes in.
[20:40.120 --> 20:42.600]  That's what feed reading has sort of evolved to.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.160]  It wasn't like that 17 years ago.
[20:45.160 --> 20:47.000]  No, but now it is.
[20:47.000 --> 20:52.680]  But if you have a feed bin account and you want to also read IR, your RSS feed, same
[20:52.680 --> 20:58.420]  feeds on your iPad and your iPhone, all you need is, is any of the various RSS readers
[20:58.420 --> 21:03.760]  that support feed bin on those platforms use the same credentials and you can do it.
[21:03.760 --> 21:06.580]  And it just, it just feels like net news wire.
[21:06.580 --> 21:08.680]  It's fast, super fast.
[21:08.680 --> 21:09.680]  Everything's snappy.
[21:09.680 --> 21:14.620]  You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move around, which is to me like it just
[21:14.620 --> 21:18.000]  defines the art, you know, the, the net news wire experience.
[21:18.000 --> 21:19.000]  Yep.
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.000]  It, it's really been years since there was an RSS reader that felt like net news wire.
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.460]  And honestly, in that interim, I sort of, I never completely stopped using RSS, but
[21:31.460 --> 21:37.020]  I was using net news wire three, the last version Brent developed, I mean, no offense
[21:37.020 --> 21:38.740]  to the black pixel folk.
[21:38.740 --> 21:42.340]  I don't, you know, although I guess it is slightly offensive.
[21:42.340 --> 21:45.440]  I just never liked their version of net news wire.
[21:45.440 --> 21:46.960]  It just didn't feel right to me.
[21:46.960 --> 21:53.120]  So I just stuck with net news wire 3.32 or something and it really started looking dated,
[21:53.120 --> 21:54.120]  you know what I mean?
[21:54.120 --> 22:01.040]  It just looked like, like a 20 2009 app, you know, it just had the wrong style icons and
[22:01.040 --> 22:05.300]  you know, I'm not super picky about stuff like that, but it just grows on you.
[22:05.300 --> 22:10.160]  So I kind of faded away from RSS, but now that net news wire is back, I'm back reading
[22:10.160 --> 22:12.200]  RSS and I couldn't be happier about it.
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.760]  Well, it's funny cause Brent pinged me a little while ago and said, Hey, you're, your icon
[22:16.760 --> 22:21.400]  doesn't look right in net news wire.
[22:21.400 --> 22:30.040]  It looks too small and you know, he did ping me about it and I forgot to do anything about
[22:30.040 --> 22:31.040]  it.
[22:31.040 --> 22:38.360]  So unfortunately I don't, I don't know if he, if he took it out or if he actually left
[22:38.360 --> 22:42.560]  it in there or what, but Brent a, sorry man, I will do it.
[22:42.560 --> 22:43.560]  I will do it.
[22:43.560 --> 22:44.560]  All right.
[22:44.560 --> 22:45.880]  Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[22:45.880 --> 22:51.200]  So our good friends at Casper here I am, who would have thought by 2019 I'd be selling
[22:51.200 --> 22:57.000]  mattresses on the internet, but I am, and I couldn't be happier to do it because I love
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.640]  this company's products.
[22:59.640 --> 23:06.160]  Casper's mattresses and other sleep products are all cleverly designed to mimic human curves,
[23:06.160 --> 23:08.600]  providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.
[23:08.600 --> 23:10.320]  You spend one third of your life sleeping.
[23:10.320 --> 23:14.000]  I spend more than a third of my life sleeping to be honest.
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.240]  So you should be comfortable.
[23:16.240 --> 23:21.120]  The experts at Casper work tirelessly to make a quality sleep service that cradles your
[23:21.120 --> 23:23.520]  natural geometry and all the right places.
[23:23.520 --> 23:27.960]  The original Casper mattress back in the day, they only had one style of mattress.
[23:27.960 --> 23:28.960]  That's the original.
[23:28.960 --> 23:33.040]  They combined multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep service with the right
[23:33.040 --> 23:35.960]  amounts of both sink and bounce.
[23:35.960 --> 23:41.060]  Breathable design helps you sleep cool, regulate your body temperature throughout the night.
[23:41.060 --> 23:46.320]  Well reviewed 4.8 star average across Casper, Amazon and Google's websites.
[23:46.320 --> 23:48.820]  It's it's becoming the internet's favorite mattress.
[23:48.820 --> 23:51.820]  Now they also offer four other mattresses.
[23:51.820 --> 23:58.320]  Now the wave, the essential, the hybrid Casper and the hybrid wave.
[23:58.320 --> 24:02.400]  The wave features a patent pending premium support system to mirror the natural shape
[24:02.400 --> 24:03.920]  of your body.
[24:03.920 --> 24:08.360]  The essential has a streamlined design at a price that won't keep you up at night.
[24:08.360 --> 24:11.480]  That's the one that's a little bit less expensive, still a great mattress.
[24:11.480 --> 24:12.480]  The hybrid.
[24:12.480 --> 24:18.160]  So originally their first three mattresses were all foam, special foam, different layers.
[24:18.160 --> 24:25.080]  Now the hybrids combine their foam with springs, new technology, and they also offer a wide
[24:25.080 --> 24:31.000]  array of other products like pillows and sheets to ensure an overall better sleep experience.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.880]  And they're all designed, developed and assembled in the U S they've got their own mattress
[24:35.880 --> 24:36.880]  engineers.
[24:36.880 --> 24:41.720]  Jim, they don't just take mattresses from some company in China or wherever and then
[24:41.720 --> 24:43.420]  stick a Casper label on them.
[24:43.420 --> 24:47.200]  They've got mattress engineers here dedicated to helping us sleep better right here in the
[24:47.200 --> 24:50.400]  USA, making these mattresses.
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.640]  And they've got affordable prices, way more affordable than comparable premium mattresses
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.120]  that you'd get at a mattress store because they cut out the middleman and sell directly
[24:59.120 --> 25:00.160]  to you.
[25:00.160 --> 25:03.360]  And you think, I don't want to buy a mattress on the internet.
[25:03.360 --> 25:04.640]  I can't try it.
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.040]  They've got hassle free returns.
[25:06.040 --> 25:12.360]  If you're not completely satisfied, free shipping and returns in the U S and Canada.
[25:12.360 --> 25:13.360]  There you go.
[25:13.360 --> 25:14.360]  I love it.
[25:14.360 --> 25:15.480]  A hundred night risk free.
[25:15.480 --> 25:18.960]  You can sleep on it for three months plus.
[25:18.960 --> 25:22.280]  And if you don't like it, send it back free of charge, they'll give you all your money
[25:22.280 --> 25:23.280]  back.
[25:23.280 --> 25:28.560]  I got to tell you, it's a huge change in my life.
[25:28.560 --> 25:33.720]  I remember before I had a Casper mattress, go on vacation, go to a nice hotel, sleep
[25:33.720 --> 25:38.780]  on a really nice hotel mattress, go home and think my mattress was cruddy.
[25:38.780 --> 25:44.760]  Now I go on vacation, sleep on a nice hotel bed, come home, and I'm delighted to be back
[25:44.760 --> 25:46.120]  in my Casper mattress.
[25:46.120 --> 25:47.120]  That's how good it is.
[25:47.120 --> 25:50.000]  I'm sleeping in a luxury hotel every single night.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.800]  Here's a special offer for listeners to the show.
[25:51.800 --> 25:59.120]  You can say 50 bucks towards select mattresses by visiting casper.com, C A S P E R casper.com
[25:59.120 --> 26:00.840]  slash talk show.
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.020]  And remember that code talk show at checkout.
[26:04.020 --> 26:09.960]  So go to casper.com slash talk show, special code talk show terms and conditions apply.
[26:09.960 --> 26:16.120]  I don't know what those terms and conditions are, but they, they do apply.
[26:16.120 --> 26:19.040]  Now we can get to the, we get to the meat of the show.
[26:19.040 --> 26:20.040]  All right.
[26:20.040 --> 26:21.300]  How about apple card?
[26:21.300 --> 26:23.320]  Apple card is now available widespread.
[26:23.320 --> 26:25.440]  You get an apple card.
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.480]  I do not have one yet.
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.840]  And it's, it's kind of funny for me because I will get one.
[26:31.840 --> 26:33.080]  I will get one eventually.
[26:33.080 --> 26:44.200]  But since I moved here I've basically done everything that I do in, in California with
[26:44.200 --> 26:45.200]  cash.
[26:45.200 --> 26:49.840]  And I, I, I, you know, most of what I do is in cash.
[26:49.840 --> 26:58.120]  So getting a credit card, there's, you know, it's not a big deal, but then I start to think
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.680]  about it and think, well, you know, I've done everything in cash.
[27:01.680 --> 27:03.080]  Do I need a credit card?
[27:03.080 --> 27:04.760]  Do I want a credit card?
[27:04.760 --> 27:09.300]  You know, so it's just one of those things where I haven't really decided what I want
[27:09.300 --> 27:11.040]  to do yet.
[27:11.040 --> 27:13.440]  So I got one, I signed up for one.
[27:13.440 --> 27:19.440]  Now the press, some of the people in the press, including yours truly were invited to get
[27:19.440 --> 27:24.120]  one early, you know, in a way that if you, if you, people outside the press also got
[27:24.120 --> 27:29.360]  them early where if you, when they first announced it, I don't know when earlier in the year
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.680]  you could sign up at apple.com and say, notify me, you know, as soon as you can.
[27:34.680 --> 27:37.720]  And I have a couple of friends, you know, who got the notification like, Hey, you can
[27:37.720 --> 27:41.680]  sign up, you know, now before it's widespread availability.
[27:41.680 --> 27:52.160]  Um, I waited partially out of, uh, apathy for lack of a better word and partially because
[27:52.160 --> 27:59.760]  I sort of wanted the, the regular experience, like the typical, you know, uh, I don't want
[27:59.760 --> 28:03.640]  a special experience and you know, I think it makes sense.
[28:03.640 --> 28:08.400]  A credit card is a very strange product for apple, you know, like they come out with,
[28:08.400 --> 28:15.200]  let's say a new Mac book pro and members of the media like me or you might, they might
[28:15.200 --> 28:20.720]  loan us one for two months and it's a review unit and they just, you know, you sign in
[28:20.720 --> 28:24.800]  the NDA and you sign an agreement that you're going to, you know, keep this for eight weeks
[28:24.800 --> 28:28.960]  and then mail it back to them and then you're using it for review purposes.
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.500]  And if there's an embargo because it's not out for 10 days, you know, you agreed not
[28:34.500 --> 28:41.000]  to write about it until such and such date when the embargo, that blah, blah, blah, um,
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.800]  they don't, they didn't do anything funny like that with the credit card.
[28:43.800 --> 28:50.800]  Like nobody in the media got like a review credit card loaded up with, you know, a hundred
[28:50.800 --> 28:53.200]  dollars of apple money or something like that to test.
[28:53.200 --> 28:58.320]  Well, I mean they could have, but you know, but because it's a credit card, I think it's
[28:58.320 --> 28:59.320]  weird.
[28:59.320 --> 29:02.400]  So anybody in the media who got one and wrote about it, put it on their own name using their
[29:02.400 --> 29:07.720]  own credit and, and you know, whatever limit they got, you know, was what Goldman Sachs
[29:07.720 --> 29:09.920]  looking at your credit history got.
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.800]  So there's, you know, nothing funny like that.
[29:11.800 --> 29:14.160]  Um, you know, and I think that makes sense.
[29:14.160 --> 29:20.000]  Uh, so, you know, uh, I don't think it would be right to, to, you know, I, I, it would
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.960]  just be fishy if they were given people in the media money to spend.
[29:23.960 --> 29:24.960]  Yes.
[29:24.960 --> 29:31.000]  Um, so I waited until I forget what day it was last week when it was like, okay, apple
[29:31.000 --> 29:34.080]  pay or apple card is now available to everybody.
[29:34.080 --> 29:39.240]  And so I went into, uh, you go to the wallet app, you hit the plus button and it's like,
[29:39.240 --> 29:41.520]  do you want to sign up for apple card?
[29:41.520 --> 29:44.240]  And I said yes.
[29:44.240 --> 29:48.680]  And I have to say that signup process is, is truly outstanding.
[29:48.680 --> 29:55.320]  It really is very, very smooth and very, very fast.
[29:55.320 --> 30:02.320]  Uh, and, and it auto fills an awful lot of the stuff because your phone already knows
[30:02.320 --> 30:04.600]  your first name and your last name.
[30:04.600 --> 30:09.200]  It auto filled my, my phone number because I was doing it on the phone.
[30:09.200 --> 30:13.960]  Um, just about anything that could be auto filled was auto filled.
[30:13.960 --> 30:20.160]  Uh, the only thing I think it didn't auto fill was my, you have to tell them what your
[30:20.160 --> 30:21.160]  income is.
[30:21.160 --> 30:22.780]  So, you know, my phone doesn't know that.
[30:22.780 --> 30:25.020]  So I typed that in, but they're very clear.
[30:25.020 --> 30:29.680]  They say in very clear words that apple does not receive that information.
[30:29.680 --> 30:34.600]  That only goes to Goldman Sachs and whatever, you know, they have to, I guess, look at that.
[30:34.600 --> 30:37.560]  Uh, and then you hit okay.
[30:37.560 --> 30:42.480]  And it spun for a little bit and it gave, you know, said, you know, waiting, I forget,
[30:42.480 --> 30:46.360]  you know, and then boom, you know, it was like, okay, you're approved.
[30:46.360 --> 30:47.360]  Here's your apple card.
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.360]  There it is.
[30:48.360 --> 30:49.360]  It's in your wallet.
[30:49.360 --> 30:50.360]  You could go use it.
[30:50.360 --> 30:51.360]  You know, I don't know.
[30:51.360 --> 30:53.840]  15 seconds, 20 seconds, something like that.
[30:53.840 --> 30:54.840]  Yeah.
[30:54.840 --> 31:03.240]  I was there with, um, my girlfriend when she, uh, she, she wanted, wanted, and it was out.
[31:03.240 --> 31:07.020]  So I showed her where to go on the, you know, the wallet to get it.
[31:07.020 --> 31:12.120]  She went in, pressed a couple of buttons and, and all of a sudden it was back.
[31:12.120 --> 31:15.760]  I bet you the whole process didn't take more than a minute, minute and a half.
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.760]  I agree.
[31:16.760 --> 31:17.760]  Yeah.
[31:17.760 --> 31:18.760]  Same for me.
[31:18.760 --> 31:21.560]  It was back in her wallet and they said, yeah, here you go.
[31:21.560 --> 31:27.360]  Um, here's my question to you with your girlfriend after that, after she got approved, was she
[31:27.360 --> 31:33.960]  prompted to use her apple card for all apple purchases?
[31:33.960 --> 31:36.760]  Oh, I don't know.
[31:36.760 --> 31:41.020]  Some of my friends say they were that they, you know, they don't think she was being,
[31:41.020 --> 31:43.700]  she was prompted to get a card, right?
[31:43.700 --> 31:46.760]  But I don't think she was prompted to use the card, right?
[31:46.760 --> 31:52.960]  So one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I wanted the card, you know, partially curiosity,
[31:52.960 --> 31:58.520]  but partially the 3% cash back on apple purchases, which applies to everything.
[31:58.520 --> 32:00.760]  It applies to buying like hardware.
[32:00.760 --> 32:03.880]  It applies to iTunes and app store purchases.
[32:03.880 --> 32:04.880]  Anything you buy from apple.
[32:04.880 --> 32:10.840]  If you use your apple card, you get 3% cash back, which beats any other card that I have
[32:10.840 --> 32:12.720]  in terms of, you know, rewards.
[32:12.720 --> 32:17.520]  So it makes sense to switch everything over.
[32:17.520 --> 32:21.540]  You know, so one of the first things I wanted to do after I was approved for the card was
[32:21.540 --> 32:28.420]  switch my, my, my iTunes and app store account to use this card instead of my Amex, which
[32:28.420 --> 32:35.340]  I'd been using for years and to switch my store account saved card to use the apple
[32:35.340 --> 32:40.360]  card so that, you know, I mean, you can obviously enter it when I actually go to the online
[32:40.360 --> 32:43.600]  apple store and buy something I could, you know, obviously enter it then.
[32:43.600 --> 32:46.420]  But when, you know, I expected that to be easy and some of my friends said they were
[32:46.420 --> 32:50.740]  prompted for that, that they just had a button and idea, right?
[32:50.740 --> 32:54.620]  And that you can go and they also say that, that they have a button.
[32:54.620 --> 32:59.020]  If you go to the wallet, once you've added the card, you go to the wallet, you pick your
[32:59.020 --> 33:03.580]  apple card and you hit this, that dot, dot, dot button.
[33:03.580 --> 33:09.040]  And like somewhere down, like there's like a section here for a bank accounts.
[33:09.040 --> 33:13.580]  And then underneath that, there's like a little button that says, you know, you, I forget
[33:13.580 --> 33:18.980]  exact words, but you know, use apple card for all apple purchases and you hit that button
[33:18.980 --> 33:24.540]  and it changes all of your online accounts to, to, to use the apple card.
[33:24.540 --> 33:25.940]  Well, I did good with that.
[33:25.940 --> 33:29.820]  I don't, I don't have that button and I didn't get prompted for it.
[33:29.820 --> 33:30.820]  Huh?
[33:30.820 --> 33:34.820]  And it's like, I, this isn't apple cards fault.
[33:34.820 --> 33:39.580]  It, it, I think it's apple's fault, but it's not apple cards fault.
[33:39.580 --> 33:44.880]  Like the apple card signup process was seamless for me and I got it, but I didn't get prompted
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.380]  for that.
[33:46.380 --> 33:48.720]  So I thought, well, I'll just change it manually.
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.820]  So I go into wherever you go and say, you know, there's a couple, couple paths to get
[33:53.820 --> 33:54.820]  there.
[33:54.820 --> 33:59.300]  You can, cause if you change, if you change your payment in the app store, app store payments,
[33:59.300 --> 34:01.560]  you know, change your credit card there.
[34:01.560 --> 34:04.740]  It also changes your iTunes, your iTunes in your app store is the same thing.
[34:04.740 --> 34:08.380]  So you can go through, you know, to iTunes and then go to payments and change your credit
[34:08.380 --> 34:11.420]  card and then it'll also change your app store either way.
[34:11.420 --> 34:14.820]  But when I went there, I only have one credit card.
[34:14.820 --> 34:21.360]  I only had one credit card on my iTunes account and it was an American express card that I've
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.500]  had for years earlier this year.
[34:25.500 --> 34:30.620]  I forget how many months, let's say five, four or five months ago.
[34:30.620 --> 34:35.220]  The card was flagged for fraudulent purchases.
[34:35.220 --> 34:42.020]  Somebody was using it at a home shopping network and that's not you sitting up in the middle
[34:42.020 --> 34:43.020]  of the night.
[34:43.020 --> 34:44.020]  Nope.
[34:44.020 --> 34:46.420]  Well, it's a funny story, Jim.
[34:46.420 --> 34:55.380]  So somebody bought a, a curling iron on the home shopping network using my Amex.
[34:55.380 --> 35:01.760]  And the slightly freaky thing about it is it wound up getting shipped to me as well.
[35:01.760 --> 35:08.260]  And the guy, the name was Frank Browns, not Frank Brown, Frank Browns with an S, which
[35:08.260 --> 35:09.620]  seems like a made up name.
[35:09.620 --> 35:14.600]  I've never heard of anybody whose last name is B-R-O-W-N-S.
[35:14.600 --> 35:21.160]  But Amex is, is a terrific credit card in terms of a lot of these features that, that
[35:21.160 --> 35:25.740]  Apple pay has, like the Amex app is terrific.
[35:25.740 --> 35:27.300]  It stays up to date.
[35:27.300 --> 35:32.020]  I get notifications of payments very shortly after they're made.
[35:32.020 --> 35:37.740]  Like if I go to the corner store and buy a six pack of beer, I'll get a notification
[35:37.740 --> 35:44.260]  that I went to the market and, you know, bought, uh, you know, $16, $16 purchase as I'm walking
[35:44.260 --> 35:46.540]  out the door, you know?
[35:46.540 --> 35:47.540]  Right.
[35:47.540 --> 35:51.300]  Mine, mine would ping me and say, why'd you only buy a six pack?
[35:51.300 --> 35:55.380]  Well, anyway, the next day, like, I don't know when this must've happened at night.
[35:55.380 --> 36:01.600]  The next day, Amy, Amy got, you know, is on the same Amex account.
[36:01.600 --> 36:04.820]  And she says to me, what were you doing last night?
[36:04.820 --> 36:05.820]  And I said, nothing.
[36:05.820 --> 36:09.380]  I was watching a movie.
[36:09.380 --> 36:11.220]  And she said, how much did you have to drink?
[36:11.220 --> 36:14.340]  And I said, no, I mean, you know, not a lot.
[36:14.340 --> 36:17.020]  She goes, did you buy something at home shopping network?
[36:17.020 --> 36:18.700]  And I was like, no.
[36:18.700 --> 36:22.260]  And she's like, are you sure?
[36:22.260 --> 36:26.140]  And I said, I swear to God, because here's the funny thing is I, back in the day, I used
[36:26.140 --> 36:29.900]  to like watching, I never bought anything, but I used to like watching the home shopping
[36:29.900 --> 36:35.620]  network, like, you know, like 20 years ago, uh, you know, uh, you know, have a couple
[36:35.620 --> 36:39.500]  of beers, you know, uh, uh, put the home shopping on.
[36:39.500 --> 36:43.940]  I just enjoyed the, the, the, like the carnival Barker aspect of it.
[36:43.940 --> 36:44.940]  You know what I mean?
[36:44.940 --> 36:49.860]  Like the, like, it didn't make me want to buy stuff, but I found it fascinating to watch
[36:49.860 --> 36:50.860]  it.
[36:50.860 --> 36:51.860]  I especially like to watch.
[36:51.860 --> 36:52.860]  There was a big loud mouth guy.
[36:52.860 --> 36:56.740]  He used to sell baseball cards, you know, like collector, you know, like a Pete Rose
[36:56.740 --> 36:58.580]  rookie card and stuff like that.
[36:58.580 --> 37:02.500]  And he'd be screaming at you, you know, that, you know, you're, if you don't buy this rookie
[37:02.500 --> 37:06.720]  card, you know, you're, you're, you're doing not just yourself a disservice, you're doing
[37:06.720 --> 37:12.040]  your children a disservice because this, this card is going to be worth so much money.
[37:12.040 --> 37:13.300]  This is an inheritance.
[37:13.300 --> 37:16.700]  You know, this is going to discard is going to do nothing but go up, you know, and, and
[37:16.700 --> 37:17.980]  I just enjoyed watching it.
[37:17.980 --> 37:22.060]  So she knew I used to watch it like 20 years ago and she's, and, and she was like giving
[37:22.060 --> 37:28.940]  me like, you know, like like a total like skeevy eye, like maybe I put a load on and
[37:28.940 --> 37:31.380]  bought it, bought something at home, but we didn't know what we bought.
[37:31.380 --> 37:36.740]  All we saw from Amex was like a, a $60 charge from home shopping.
[37:36.740 --> 37:41.220]  Next day, ding dong, you know, FedEx shows up or UPS or whoever, and there's the box
[37:41.220 --> 37:47.220]  address to Frank Browns, but with our address and we open it up and it's a goddamn curling
[37:47.220 --> 37:50.920]  iron from home shopping network, you know, and I had already called, I called Amex the
[37:50.920 --> 37:54.940]  day before and reported, you know, that it was fraud.
[37:54.940 --> 37:57.520]  So anyway, you know, the card was used for fraud.
[37:57.520 --> 37:58.860]  They said, don't worry about it.
[37:58.860 --> 37:59.860]  We'll send you a new card.
[37:59.860 --> 38:00.860]  We'll have it.
[38:00.860 --> 38:01.980]  You know, FedEx is great about this.
[38:01.980 --> 38:06.140]  They literally, they, they like overnight, it showed up, you know, probably before the
[38:06.140 --> 38:08.320]  curling iron did.
[38:08.320 --> 38:10.980]  But they told me, they said, you know, we'll get you a new card.
[38:10.980 --> 38:13.540]  We'll have a new number.
[38:13.540 --> 38:17.340]  But you don't need to change any of your stuff online.
[38:17.340 --> 38:21.540]  Anything you have saved online will continue to work.
[38:21.540 --> 38:23.900]  And indeed, they were true to their word.
[38:23.900 --> 38:25.700]  I didn't really log into anything.
[38:25.700 --> 38:31.580]  And like my iTunes purchases kept working, you know, my Amazon stuff kept working.
[38:31.580 --> 38:34.880]  Even though I had a new number, it's like they, you know, I guess the way these, these
[38:34.880 --> 38:40.220]  modern companies do it is they don't just save a stupid 16 digit number.
[38:40.220 --> 38:45.500]  There's like a, a handshake that they do, you know, cryptographically secure and that,
[38:45.500 --> 38:50.220]  you know, they, they've got some kind of deeper connection than just stupid numbers.
[38:50.220 --> 38:51.220]  Right.
[38:51.220 --> 39:01.640]  Um, but turns out, I don't know if it was through software updates or what, um, on when
[39:01.640 --> 39:08.900]  I went to the payment section on my iPhone for iTunes, it, it, I had had my Amex and
[39:08.900 --> 39:14.300]  it was, like I said, I've been buying stuff for months using it, but it said needs verification
[39:14.300 --> 39:16.420]  like in red.
[39:16.420 --> 39:22.060]  And what they wanted me to do was to go in and enter the, the CVV number, you know, the
[39:22.060 --> 39:23.060]  secret, right?
[39:23.060 --> 39:24.060]  Extra number.
[39:24.060 --> 39:25.060]  Yeah.
[39:25.060 --> 39:33.280]  Um, but I couldn't do that because the old card was canceled and I, and I, I I'd thrown
[39:33.280 --> 39:34.280]  it out.
[39:34.280 --> 39:41.140]  And I, I think I remember the old CVV number because I used it so many times, but I, and
[39:41.140 --> 39:43.100]  if I'm correct, it still wouldn't take it.
[39:43.100 --> 39:47.660]  And that kind of makes sense because that whole card is invalidated and it wouldn't
[39:47.660 --> 39:51.540]  take my new number because that's not the same.
[39:51.540 --> 39:58.580]  They wanted one that ended in, you know, here's the last four digits of the card and the verification
[39:58.580 --> 40:04.860]  sheet, the thing that says, we want you to verify this, you know, for the card ending
[40:04.860 --> 40:09.980]  in these four digits, you know, with this expiration date, we want your CVV number.
[40:09.980 --> 40:13.620]  The only field that's editable was the CVV number.
[40:13.620 --> 40:22.100]  I couldn't type the whole new credit card in and I couldn't delete the card and re add
[40:22.100 --> 40:29.060]  a new card because it said the, the, cause we have family sharing for iTunes and I said,
[40:29.060 --> 40:34.540]  and I'm the family organizer, the family organizer needs at least one card.
[40:34.540 --> 40:38.940]  So I was in a total catch 22 situation.
[40:38.940 --> 40:43.420]  I couldn't, and it wouldn't let me add a new card either because it said, before I add
[40:43.420 --> 40:46.860]  a new card, I need to verify the one that needed verification.
[40:46.860 --> 40:49.000]  So I couldn't, man, so I stuck.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.540]  So I couldn't add a new card because the other one needed to be verified.
[40:53.540 --> 40:58.100]  I couldn't verify it because the card wouldn't let me edit the whole number.
[40:58.100 --> 41:05.420]  It would only take the old number and I couldn't delete it because I'm the family organizer.
[41:05.420 --> 41:06.980]  What did you do?
[41:06.980 --> 41:09.980]  Well, I don't know if it was the right thing.
[41:09.980 --> 41:15.620]  I think what I should have done and I should have done is called Apple and I don't know
[41:15.620 --> 41:21.700]  what number and that's why I didn't call them cause I didn't know what number to call.
[41:21.700 --> 41:25.580]  I mean, I probably could have Googled it and found it in 20 seconds, but I should have
[41:25.580 --> 41:29.300]  called Apple, but I just don't like calling people.
[41:29.300 --> 41:38.300]  So what I did is disable family sharing and then I could delete the card and I had no
[41:38.300 --> 41:46.220]  cards on my iTunes account and I re added both my new Amex and my new Apple card and
[41:46.220 --> 41:49.140]  then I turned family sharing back on again.
[41:49.140 --> 41:54.180]  But that was probably the wrong way to do it because it was, well, cause it was sort
[41:54.180 --> 42:03.340]  of a pain in the ass where, uh, Amy and Jonas had to like re agree to everything and we
[42:03.340 --> 42:06.980]  had to, you know, when you turn on family sharing, which is a great feature when it's
[42:06.980 --> 42:12.460]  working, but we had to like turn on that we want to share apps, we want to share movies,
[42:12.460 --> 42:16.740]  we want to share location, we want to share, I forget what else, there's like four or five
[42:16.740 --> 42:20.680]  things you can share, but you have to turn them all back on and they both had to re add
[42:20.680 --> 42:22.140]  it and I, you know what I mean?
[42:22.140 --> 42:23.760]  It's just like a funny notification.
[42:23.760 --> 42:28.920]  It says I get like a notification like five minutes later it says, Jonas Gruber has joined
[42:28.920 --> 42:34.380]  your family and it's like,
[42:34.380 --> 42:38.460]  guess what?
[42:38.460 --> 42:40.460]  We have a son.
[42:40.460 --> 42:47.820]  Well, I mean, at least you found a way if other people are in this, uh, this predicament
[42:47.820 --> 42:48.820]  then.
[42:48.820 --> 42:49.820]  Yeah.
[42:49.820 --> 42:56.060]  Uh, and, and then the one, the one thing that really stuck with me is that, um, and it was
[42:56.060 --> 43:02.980]  such a pain in the ass, uh, is that the one app for the, for the most part, I'm the one
[43:02.980 --> 43:05.420]  who buys lots of apps and I tend to buy the movies.
[43:05.420 --> 43:07.260]  And it seemed like movies weren't a problem.
[43:07.260 --> 43:13.460]  Like Jonas, I was able to, as soon as I re enabled all this movies that have been bought
[43:13.460 --> 43:18.300]  on my account, uh, he could play and it played with no problem.
[43:18.300 --> 43:22.500]  But Amy was the one who bought tweet bot for iOS.
[43:22.500 --> 43:27.860]  And the reason she bought it instead of me was that I, I'm a beta tester for tweet bot.
[43:27.860 --> 43:30.220]  And so I was still using the beta for free.
[43:30.220 --> 43:34.660]  Like when tweet bot five shipped and you know, the update came out and she loves tweet bot
[43:34.660 --> 43:35.660]  too.
[43:35.660 --> 43:40.620]  So she bought it, you know, um, and so ever since when I've been used and, and it's not
[43:40.620 --> 43:44.420]  currently in beta, there's no like in test flight, there's no beta available.
[43:44.420 --> 43:45.980]  So I've been using the app store version.
[43:45.980 --> 43:50.980]  But when I tried launching tweet bot on my iPhone, it said, you can't use this app because
[43:50.980 --> 43:53.940]  it's no longer being shared with you.
[43:53.940 --> 43:59.680]  So and then it said, you need to go to the app store and purchase it yourself.
[43:59.680 --> 44:01.760]  Now it's all tweet bots, only five bucks.
[44:01.760 --> 44:02.940]  So I don't care.
[44:02.940 --> 44:04.500]  I honest to God, I love it.
[44:04.500 --> 44:06.780]  I like supporting independent developers.
[44:06.780 --> 44:12.460]  I think $5 is too little for an app that I use as much as tweet bot happy, happy to give
[44:12.460 --> 44:15.120]  them an extra five bucks really honestly.
[44:15.120 --> 44:21.700]  But the problem is I'd go to the app store and the app store entry for tweet bot didn't
[44:21.700 --> 44:22.700]  say buy.
[44:22.700 --> 44:26.560]  It said open because it was already on my phone.
[44:26.560 --> 44:27.560]  So I couldn't buy it.
[44:27.560 --> 44:29.700]  So you have to delete it.
[44:29.700 --> 44:31.580]  I deleted it.
[44:31.580 --> 44:33.260]  And that is true.
[44:33.260 --> 44:34.300]  I deleted it.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.580]  And then it would say bye.
[44:35.580 --> 44:37.420]  So you're, you're one step ahead of me.
[44:37.420 --> 44:38.420]  And then I'd say bye.
[44:38.420 --> 44:40.660]  And it would do face ID.
[44:40.660 --> 44:44.340]  And then it would say, you know, I didn't say congratulations.
[44:44.340 --> 44:47.740]  But effectively, it's like, congratulations, you don't need to purchase this, a family
[44:47.740 --> 44:49.540]  member has already bought it.
[44:49.540 --> 44:54.980]  I swear to God, and I hit okay, it downloads.
[44:54.980 --> 44:59.840]  And I launch it and it says you can't use this app because it's no longer being shared
[44:59.840 --> 45:00.980]  with you.
[45:00.980 --> 45:09.560]  So the app store knew that after having disabled family sharing and re enabling family sharing
[45:09.560 --> 45:16.340]  with the same two people, the app store could properly see that this was an app that Amy
[45:16.340 --> 45:21.200]  had bought and she's in my family sharing circle, so I shouldn't need to buy it.
[45:21.200 --> 45:28.380]  But springboard, the iPhone launcher, obviously lost track of somewhere in there somewhere
[45:28.380 --> 45:33.220]  in there, like when I when I disabled family sharing, and then re enabled it, it's somehow
[45:33.220 --> 45:36.980]  still had tweetbot.
[45:36.980 --> 45:42.380]  And the odd thing is that this was true on both of my iPhones that I'm using the one
[45:42.380 --> 45:48.020]  like I said, I've got the iPhone 10 running the the iOS 13 betas, I've got my iPhone 10s
[45:48.020 --> 45:50.140]  that's running iOS 12.4.
[45:50.140 --> 45:52.880]  Neither of them could launch it with the exact same problem.
[45:52.880 --> 45:55.820]  My iPad, though, could launch it just fine.
[45:55.820 --> 46:00.700]  And I'm not 100% sure if that's because it was still running.
[46:00.700 --> 46:02.820]  And it wasn't really relaunching.
[46:02.820 --> 46:07.740]  And I was afraid to, I was afraid to force quit it, because I didn't want to lose the
[46:07.740 --> 46:10.660]  only device I had to where it still worked.
[46:10.660 --> 46:11.660]  Yeah.
[46:11.660 --> 46:15.540]  And I wound up fixing it.
[46:15.540 --> 46:20.280]  And I have another iPad, too, I have an iPad mini where I'm running the iPad beta.
[46:20.280 --> 46:22.380]  And on that one, it was giving me the sharing thing.
[46:22.380 --> 46:27.300]  And so I wound up fixing this by.
[46:27.300 --> 46:31.820]  And then I, because I knew I was going to talk about it on the podcast for sure.
[46:31.820 --> 46:34.940]  And I might write about it at daring fireball.
[46:34.940 --> 46:39.380]  And for the most part, a lot of the times, I don't really contact Apple before I write
[46:39.380 --> 46:43.420]  about stuff, even if I'm complaining, but this felt like one where I should give them
[46:43.420 --> 46:47.460]  a chance to explain or figure out what the hell is going on.
[46:47.460 --> 46:52.420]  So I got in contact with Apple PR for Apple card and explained everything I've just told
[46:52.420 --> 46:54.060]  you over the last 10 minutes.
[46:54.060 --> 46:57.980]  So it was a very long email.
[46:57.980 --> 47:05.140]  And I got to talk to somebody on JAWS's team who's in the product marketing group.
[47:05.140 --> 47:11.300]  And his first guess and it was right, he was like, let me guess, you've got separate accounts
[47:11.300 --> 47:14.460]  for iCloud and iTunes.
[47:14.460 --> 47:16.180]  And I was like, yes.
[47:16.180 --> 47:19.800]  And he said, yeah, that's, you know, and for the most part over the last few years, that's,
[47:19.800 --> 47:21.060]  that's worked perfectly.
[47:21.060 --> 47:22.060]  So you know what I mean?
[47:22.060 --> 47:23.060]  Right?
[47:23.060 --> 47:27.320]  Like, yeah, yeah, it's, it's most of us have like mac.com addresses, like, if you've been
[47:27.320 --> 47:31.600]  using iCloud, since it was like mac.com.
[47:31.600 --> 47:38.100]  So I've got, you know, whatever my, you know, at mac.com is my iCloud account.
[47:38.100 --> 47:45.420]  And then I've got a daring fireball address that I have used for iTunes ever since the
[47:45.420 --> 47:47.200]  music store opened in 2002.
[47:47.200 --> 47:53.260]  So all my purchases are on a at daring fireball email address.
[47:53.260 --> 47:57.920]  And my iCloud is a mac.com.
[47:57.920 --> 47:59.820]  And I think that's the root of all of my problems.
[47:59.820 --> 48:03.680]  So I think for most people who know, you know, and I think it's very common that if you only
[48:03.680 --> 48:08.300]  have one account, and it's both your iCloud and your store account, you get like this
[48:08.300 --> 48:13.220]  magic experience, because the other Oh, the other side effect of this is that I because
[48:13.220 --> 48:17.740]  I don't have that button to just use my apple card for iTunes purchases.
[48:17.740 --> 48:25.220]  The only way that I could add my apple card as my payment source for iTunes was the old
[48:25.220 --> 48:32.480]  fashioned way of entering the 16 digit MasterCard number, enter the expiration date, enter the
[48:32.480 --> 48:39.620]  CVV secret number, and then it shows up just it just shows up in my list as a generic MasterCard,
[48:39.620 --> 48:44.980]  it doesn't show up as a apple card with an apple card, you know, shiny logo, it just
[48:44.980 --> 48:49.680]  looks like a generic, you know, how like when you add a credit card to this, like the Amex
[48:49.680 --> 48:55.320]  looks like an Amex and stuff, it just shows up as a generic MasterCard.
[48:55.320 --> 48:59.940]  And I think that's also why and I think the fact that my Amex had that verification problem
[48:59.940 --> 49:05.860]  was the reason I didn't get the prompt to just use it as my apple card because somehow
[49:05.860 --> 49:10.540]  it knew we can't add this as your payment because you have a problem with the only card
[49:10.540 --> 49:12.580]  you have on your account.
[49:12.580 --> 49:15.740]  So anyway, it just works.
[49:15.740 --> 49:18.100]  Wow.
[49:18.100 --> 49:19.100]  All good one.
[49:19.100 --> 49:23.860]  But one thing I will say too, so I wasn't sure like, hey, if this doesn't see it as
[49:23.860 --> 49:28.420]  an apple card, if it just thinks it's a generic MasterCard, am I still going to get 3% cash
[49:28.420 --> 49:29.980]  back on apple purchases?
[49:29.980 --> 49:32.260]  And the truth and the fact is, I do.
[49:32.260 --> 49:33.260]  It's still like that.
[49:33.260 --> 49:37.940]  But like if I buy a movie or rent a movie on iTunes or something like that, the next
[49:37.940 --> 49:42.300]  day when I get the notification in the wallet app, it says 3% cash back.
[49:42.300 --> 49:44.220]  Oh, well, that's good.
[49:44.220 --> 49:45.220]  Yeah.
[49:45.220 --> 49:46.220]  So I eventually straightened everything.
[49:46.220 --> 49:51.180]  I think what I had to do on these devices to get tweetbot working was on some of them,
[49:51.180 --> 49:59.420]  what I did was sign out of iCloud, but not out of iTunes.
[49:59.420 --> 50:06.540]  Family sharing goes through iCloud, even though the payment account is my iTunes account.
[50:06.540 --> 50:12.700]  But by signing out of iCloud temporarily, then I could go to the App Store and purchase
[50:12.700 --> 50:16.020]  it again and purchase it on my account.
[50:16.020 --> 50:20.220]  And so I did and spent the extra five bucks and got tweetbot.
[50:20.220 --> 50:23.180]  But the same thing didn't work on all my devices.
[50:23.180 --> 50:25.260]  Like on one of the devices, I forget which one.
[50:25.260 --> 50:27.620]  One of the phones, I think.
[50:27.620 --> 50:28.960]  Even that didn't work.
[50:28.960 --> 50:29.960]  And I forget what I did.
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.980]  I just spent like an hour just poking and downloading and deleting and buying and eventually
[50:34.980 --> 50:37.980]  I got tweetbot working again.
[50:37.980 --> 50:40.420]  Wow.
[50:40.420 --> 50:44.440]  So that's my Apple Pay story.
[50:44.440 --> 50:48.980]  Was there anything about Apple Card that you were looking for?
[50:48.980 --> 50:54.900]  I mean, when you when you look at a credit card, did you want Oh, we said that they didn't
[50:54.900 --> 51:01.020]  have miles or no, I think it's to me, the cashback seems like a great thing.
[51:01.020 --> 51:02.340]  I love the cashback.
[51:02.340 --> 51:03.340]  I really do.
[51:03.340 --> 51:06.080]  So Amex does points, right?
[51:06.080 --> 51:13.500]  And I've had Amex for, I guess, like 10 years and we've got a zillion points.
[51:13.500 --> 51:21.260]  But points are can confusing to me because it's very, very difficult to convert them
[51:21.260 --> 51:26.140]  to figure out what I want to know is the obvious thing you want to know is how many how many
[51:26.140 --> 51:28.300]  cents is a point worth?
[51:28.300 --> 51:31.940]  And the answer there and there is no answer, right?
[51:31.940 --> 51:36.200]  It's whatever they want to make it at the time, right?
[51:36.200 --> 51:43.540]  Roughly speaking, and again, like a friend of the show, and sometimes, you know, often
[51:43.540 --> 51:48.380]  guests, Dan Fromer writes like a newsletter just about this, I forget what he calls it
[51:48.380 --> 51:50.700]  points points pal or something like that.
[51:50.700 --> 51:54.340]  He's got a great newsletter that tells you all about this and how to get discounts and
[51:54.340 --> 51:58.640]  what cards to get for this and that.
[51:58.640 --> 52:08.660]  There is no easy points to dollars conversion, but roughly speaking, it's about two cents.
[52:08.660 --> 52:14.220]  And that makes sense, because you get a point for every dollar, they're worth two cents.
[52:14.220 --> 52:17.940]  So you're getting roughly 2% back, right?
[52:17.940 --> 52:18.940]  And that makes sense.
[52:18.940 --> 52:25.620]  You know, it's a good card, Amex is a good card 2% is is pretty good.
[52:25.620 --> 52:29.740]  But you really kind of have to do math when you use them.
[52:29.740 --> 52:35.340]  So like one of the one of the good ways to use Amex points is to go through Amex has
[52:35.340 --> 52:39.880]  a travel site and you can book airfare through Amex travel and you can book hotels through
[52:39.880 --> 52:42.820]  Amex travel.
[52:42.820 --> 52:45.500]  And I've used I don't really use it for airfare.
[52:45.500 --> 52:49.960]  I like using the actual American Airlines site just because I feel like so many things
[52:49.960 --> 52:53.820]  can go wrong with air travel.
[52:53.820 --> 52:59.280]  And we have an American Airlines credit card to rack up bonus because Philadelphia is so
[52:59.280 --> 53:00.620]  dominated by America.
[53:00.620 --> 53:04.420]  I can't remember the last time I flew any airline other than American.
[53:04.420 --> 53:05.420]  Really?
[53:05.420 --> 53:08.540]  Yeah, I think I flew Southwest.
[53:08.540 --> 53:13.060]  And I like Southwest, but I think I flew Southwest once about three years ago.
[53:13.060 --> 53:19.160]  Otherwise, every single trip my entire family has taken business or pleasure for five or
[53:19.160 --> 53:25.820]  six years has been on American Airlines because they go everywhere we go be we've got gold
[53:25.820 --> 53:35.020]  status and see they so dominate Philadelphia that there's an awful lot of places where
[53:35.020 --> 53:41.260]  Americans literally the only direct flight or like flying to Vegas.
[53:41.260 --> 53:46.220]  I think United has a direct flight, but it's like at an awful time.
[53:46.220 --> 53:51.020]  It's like it leaves Philly at five o'clock at night and you don't get to Vegas until
[53:51.020 --> 53:52.020]  11.
[53:52.020 --> 53:57.460]  So it's like, you know, I mean, like you're paying for a night at the hotel, but you didn't
[53:57.460 --> 54:00.940]  even get there till 11 o'clock who the you know, what the hell kind of a day of vacation
[54:00.940 --> 54:01.940]  is that?
[54:01.940 --> 54:04.540]  So for you know, and I love getting direct flights.
[54:04.540 --> 54:11.180]  I really I just had so many times where I've gotten burned by having a layover and you
[54:11.180 --> 54:16.540]  know, just increase, you know, you just doubling your chances of having a delay screw you.
[54:16.540 --> 54:18.060]  So anyway, we fly American all the time.
[54:18.060 --> 54:22.140]  So we got the American credit card.
[54:22.140 --> 54:26.540]  So for airfare, we just book on American Airlines and use the that's the only thing we use the
[54:26.540 --> 54:30.300]  American credit card for is to book airfare.
[54:30.300 --> 54:34.500]  But for Amex travel for hotels, it's really kind of great.
[54:34.500 --> 54:37.380]  And what you can do, but it you're doing work.
[54:37.380 --> 54:43.300]  So in other words, let's say I want to stay at, I don't know, the Hilton in San Francisco,
[54:43.300 --> 54:50.260]  I don't know, you can go to the Hilton website, look up what their rate is, and it says it's
[54:50.260 --> 54:56.620]  $400 a night, or whatever the, you know, outrageous San Francisco hotel rate is.
[54:56.620 --> 55:00.940]  You go to Amex travel, put the same hotel in, and it tells you how many points it'll
[55:00.940 --> 55:01.940]  take.
[55:01.940 --> 55:05.860]  And therefore you can kind of compute if you roughly think of them as two cents, or am
[55:05.860 --> 55:08.700]  I getting a deal, is this a good use of my points or not?
[55:08.700 --> 55:13.060]  And occasionally, it's a phenomenal use of, you know, that if you roughly value the points
[55:13.060 --> 55:18.420]  at two cents, it's like, you know, wow, that's only like 200 bucks, you know, take it.
[55:18.420 --> 55:20.260]  And the other thing, it doesn't always work.
[55:20.260 --> 55:21.260]  They tell you it does.
[55:21.260 --> 55:24.640]  But the Amex says that you get an automatic upgrade.
[55:24.640 --> 55:30.320]  So like whatever quality room you book through Amex travel, when you check in, if it's available,
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.880]  the hotel is supposed to automatically upgrade you to the next level up.
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.480]  And it has happened to me, you know, doesn't happen every time.
[55:38.480 --> 55:43.060]  But still, yeah, I don't necessarily believe in that kind of stuff.
[55:43.060 --> 55:48.940]  When they tell me that I really don't, I maybe it's, but it's work, you know what I mean?
[55:48.940 --> 55:52.800]  And you can use points in other ways to like we have, because we have the Amex saved on
[55:52.800 --> 55:54.260]  our Amazon account.
[55:54.260 --> 55:58.920]  So anything we buy on Amazon, if we want to, we can use points instead of dollars.
[55:58.920 --> 56:01.200]  But I the math just turns me off.
[56:01.200 --> 56:04.420]  So we just wind up hoarding these points, right?
[56:04.420 --> 56:08.580]  We've got all of these Amex points that we could buy all sorts of stuff with.
[56:08.580 --> 56:11.820]  And Amy more or less wants me to lay my, you know, she considers them hers.
[56:11.820 --> 56:14.940]  She's like, she's like, don't use those points.
[56:14.940 --> 56:17.040]  And I'm like, but you never use them.
[56:17.040 --> 56:19.700]  And she's like, don't worry.
[56:19.700 --> 56:23.520]  Someday but I find cashback to be so much simpler.
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.220]  I love the cashback aspect of the card.
[56:26.220 --> 56:28.600]  It's so much simpler.
[56:28.600 --> 56:30.660]  It's it's totally it's very honest.
[56:30.660 --> 56:33.700]  It's you know, here you go, you know, you bought something for 100 bucks, here's two
[56:33.700 --> 56:36.280]  bucks back.
[56:36.280 --> 56:39.280]  The fact that they give it to you the next day is phenomenal.
[56:39.280 --> 56:40.280]  Yeah.
[56:40.280 --> 56:46.340]  And it's not going to be long before other cards start to do some of the things that
[56:46.340 --> 56:50.800]  Apple is going to do when I look at at the process and I didn't do it myself.
[56:50.800 --> 56:54.860]  But when my girlfriend did it, you know, I was there, I watched how she went through
[56:54.860 --> 56:55.860]  it.
[56:55.860 --> 56:56.860]  And it was just so simple.
[56:56.860 --> 57:00.100]  To me, that's the whole magical part of the card right there.
[57:00.100 --> 57:02.940]  Just applying for it.
[57:02.940 --> 57:11.100]  And then to see, you know, the the the way that the purchases are broken out.
[57:11.100 --> 57:16.460]  And yeah, you know, all of that is just it's so simple, but it's a very Apple way of doing
[57:16.460 --> 57:17.460]  things.
[57:17.460 --> 57:24.460]  Now, one thing I asked Dave Mark this last week when we were doing our podcast on Thursday.
[57:24.460 --> 57:25.780]  How do you pay for it?
[57:25.780 --> 57:27.660]  How do you pay off your card?
[57:27.660 --> 57:28.660]  I don't know.
[57:28.660 --> 57:29.660]  He didn't know.
[57:29.660 --> 57:30.660]  He looked in there to try and find it.
[57:30.660 --> 57:31.860]  Do you know how you pay off your car?
[57:31.860 --> 57:38.380]  So you go you go to the app to go to the wallet, you hit the dot dot dot button and scroll
[57:38.380 --> 57:44.140]  down and there's a thing called bank accounts and you can hook up your bank account.
[57:44.140 --> 57:46.340]  And then you can therefore use that.
[57:46.340 --> 57:49.200]  So you just hook up like your personal checking to it.
[57:49.200 --> 57:53.140]  And then you can use that to pay the card whenever you want.
[57:53.140 --> 57:58.580]  So you can't pay my understanding you can't pay a credit card with another credit card,
[57:58.580 --> 57:59.580]  right?
[57:59.580 --> 58:03.900]  Does that mean that you can't use a debit card in there, which is basically cash?
[58:03.900 --> 58:05.720]  No, apparently you can't.
[58:05.720 --> 58:11.740]  And it's funny because I thought of that and I'm not quite sure if it's because even though
[58:11.740 --> 58:17.580]  a debit card is cash, it's still too close to a credit card and goes through the credit
[58:17.580 --> 58:21.780]  card network, you know that they don't want to let you do it but you definitely can't
[58:21.780 --> 58:28.060]  pay a credit card with a credit card at least directly right like indirectly, you could
[58:28.060 --> 58:32.740]  take a cash advance from a credit card and use the cash advance to pay another credit
[58:32.740 --> 58:33.740]  card.
[58:33.740 --> 58:37.300]  I mean obviously if you're doing that you're, you know, you shouldn't have it in the first
[58:37.300 --> 58:38.300]  place.
[58:38.300 --> 58:40.860]  You're entering the circle of hell of credit card debt.
[58:40.860 --> 58:43.620]  So there's ways around it but you can't do it directly.
[58:43.620 --> 58:49.900]  You can't just call up your MasterCard and say here's my Visa, pay it off and then two
[58:49.900 --> 58:53.740]  weeks later call Visa and say here's my MasterCard.
[58:53.740 --> 58:55.580]  You can't.
[58:55.580 --> 59:04.700]  But I thought about that with Apple Cash because I actually have like, I don't know, somehow
[59:04.700 --> 59:15.160]  I've wound up with like $3,000 on my Apple Cash card because of various meals over the
[59:15.160 --> 59:23.420]  last year or two with friends where I've like, I've paid and then the friends have Apple
[59:23.420 --> 59:29.700]  Cashed me their share rather than put six cards in the bill or something like that.
[59:29.700 --> 59:32.500]  I'll put my card in for a couple of meals I've done this.
[59:32.500 --> 59:37.600]  So I've somehow with friends repaying me for stuff and a couple of other things like shared
[59:37.600 --> 59:41.860]  gifts for mutual friends where we've gone in and bought a gift for a friend for the
[59:41.860 --> 59:48.740]  birthday and anyway I've wound up with $3,000 on my Apple Cash card and yet I've only charged
[59:48.740 --> 59:54.220]  like in a week since I've had the Apple credit card, I've only charged like $87.
[59:54.220 --> 01:00:00.220]  So I could easily pay it with the Apple Cash but you can't.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.060]  I guess you need to put a bank account in there.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.320]  But anyway that's how you do it.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.300]  You go to the wallet, dot dot dot, scroll down, bank accounts, enter a bank account
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.220]  and then you can use the bank account to pay it.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.700]  Well that's good to know.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.700]  So very easy.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.700]  It's very easy.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:25.820]  The other thing I know that was an issue, Nicole Nguyen at Buzzfeed News had an article
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:31.220]  about the fact that there's no website to log into to look at your Apple card.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:41.020]  So if you lose your iPhone and it's your only iOS device, there's no way to access your
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:48.220]  account which is an issue and when I talked to Apple about my other problem, I asked about
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.180]  it and typical Apple fashion, they're not going to tell me what's coming.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:55.920]  They don't tell you what's coming.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.960]  But I asked, are there any plans for like a website?
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960]  And there is.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.980]  If you type wallet.apple.com, that's an actual website.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:10.140]  Right now it forwards you to another apple.com.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:15.740]  It forwards you somewhere in apple.com slash apple card and tells you all about apple card.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:24.540]  I hope that wallet.apple.com becomes a destination where you can do stuff like that.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:31.880]  But I was told something interesting talking to Apple about this which I hadn't thought
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880]  of.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.460]  So you ever hear of Mint?
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.100]  I don't know if Mint is even still around.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.040]  So like Mint is a personal finance manager.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:47.820]  You go in there and you effectively give them the login to all of your financial info.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.420]  You give them the login to your bank, you give them the login to your credit cards and
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:56.900]  stuff like that and then Mint keeps track of all of your finances and there's dozens
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:03.780]  and dozens of other services that do the same thing I'm sure because it's an obvious need
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.900]  or it's something with obvious appeal.
[01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:19.100]  Apple is genuinely concerned about the privacy implications of all of those services.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.400]  Apple did not mention anybody in specifics.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.980]  Apple didn't mention Mint in particular.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.900]  So let me make that clear.
[01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:30.940]  I mentioned Mint as an example because I know that Amy has used it and it's the one that
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.240]  I know of.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.180]  But they just mentioned them in general as a category of service.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:42.940]  But they said that they've looked in detail at these services' privacy policies and they're
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.120]  not comfortable with them.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.180]  And so if there were a website where you could log in to your Apple card and look at all
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:58.500]  your purchases and stuff like that, that would therefore enable you, it would enable a service,
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.660]  these personal finance managers to also do the same thing and Apple is not comfortable
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.660]  with that.
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:11.620]  So that's the way it works now where you can only do it through the wallet app on an iPhone.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:17.260]  There is no wallet app for iPad because it doesn't have NFC.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.700]  You can't take your iPad up and swipe it at a terminal, wave it at a terminal.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:28.740]  But you can go, there is in settings on an iPad, there is an Apple Pay and Apple Card
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.500]  or Apple Pay and Wallet section.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:41.700]  And so you can, if you have an iPad and an iPhone, you can get to your Apple Card on
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:46.300]  your iPad in settings by going down to the right section and you can do certain stuff
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.580]  there.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.620]  But by doing it only on iOS, in addition to Apple's sort of app-first mentality as opposed
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:58.340]  to web-first mentality, they also see it as privacy protection.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.900]  And I believe that, I totally believe that as part of the reason why it's set up the
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.900]  way it is.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:13.980]  Well, I mean, I trust Apple and its commitment to privacy and security implicitly.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:19.140]  Except for having contractors listen to your Siri conversations.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:24.620]  Hey, I'm gonna opt in.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:25.980]  I'm on my iPad.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.740]  You go to settings, you scroll down, and there's Wallet and Apple Pay.
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.460]  And you can go there and it lists, you know, you can use Apple Cash.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.660]  So you can, you know, from iMessage, you can send Apple Cash.
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:38.700]  Here's my Apple Card.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.760]  It's listed here.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.120]  You can go in there.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.500]  And when you go in there, and this is on the iPad, I'm looking at it right now, you get
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.340]  a lot of the same info that you see on the phone in the Wallet app.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:56.700]  So there's the little button to message so you can do the magic iMessage chat with the
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.240]  credit card people.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]  You can call them.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.060]  You can go to their website.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.340]  You can make a payment.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:14.980]  So it doesn't help you if you don't have an iPad.
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:20.180]  But if you do have an iPad and an iPhone and your iPhone is stolen or lost or totally broken,
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.360]  you can make a payment from your iPad.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:28.940]  So it's not quite as dire as the BuzzFeed story made it sound that, you know, you're
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.820]  tied to the one and only device.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:39.540]  So one of the other mini controversies about Apple Card was somebody read the terms and
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:49.900]  conditions and noticed a section that said something to the effect of Apple might send
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:56.280]  you notifications of special offers based on your purchase history.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.940]  Something to that effect.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:06.860]  And this hit Twitter and a lot of people interpreted that quite naturally as, this sucks.
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.700]  You're going to get spam about shit to buy.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:16.860]  So like if you play golf and they notice that you're, you know, once or twice a week, you're
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:22.620]  paying for 18 holes of golf or you're buying golf balls and stuff like that, all of a sudden
[01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:30.100]  you're going to start getting notifications for titleist and stuff like that.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.980]  Or if you're a sneaker collector and you buy a lot of sneakers, you're going to start
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:43.020]  getting special offers from Footlocker or something like that.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:52.180]  So talking to Apple, I think their lawyers or whoever wrote that did a bit of a disservice
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:56.500]  or at least in plain English and maybe they were just, you know, typical lawyer is covering
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.500]  Apple's ass to let them do whatever they want.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:09.840]  What that really means is it's specific to the Apple Card product meaning.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:16.020]  So the best example was, did you see that they worked out a deal with Uber where if
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:22.140]  you use Apple Card for Uber, you get the 3% instead of 2% cash back.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:28.020]  So the example they gave me was, for example, if they noticed that you use ride sharing
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:37.260]  apps and you used, you know, Apple Card for it, they might send you a notification that
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:44.820]  says, hey, Apple Card now offers 3% cash back with Uber.
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:51.500]  And as time goes on, you know, and again, they said we might, you know, but I think
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:57.860]  obviously they're working deals with all sorts of companies to get 3% instead of 2%
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.720]  with various companies.
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:06.340]  So when they work out these deals where you get the extra cash back with, let's say a
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:14.820]  certain sporting good company and they notice that you've bought sporting goods, you might
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:19.500]  get a notification that says if you go to Brand X Sporting Goods, you'll get 3% cash
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.500]  back.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:26.940]  But if you never buy sporting goods, they may not send you that notification or hopefully
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:30.840]  won't because it doesn't seem to be of interest to you.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.540]  So it's the notifications that they're talking about that you might receive based
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.580]  on your purchase history are specific to special features of Apple Card that you might want
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.880]  to know about, which still might annoy some people because I know some people are like
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.460]  notification purists.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:51.260]  And again, if you're out there listening to the podcast and you're like that, I'm not
[01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.260]  holding it against you.
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:53.460]  I'm not saying you're crazy or anything.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:09:01.540]  I mean, it's perfectly reasonable, but it's absolutely not going to be random spam like
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:05.740]  you're walking past a McDonald's and Apple Card is going to tell you to go in there and
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.740]  buy a good one.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:11.860]  Yeah, a little video from Tim comes up.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:17.540]  Well, you laugh, but the way that the terms and conditions are written, it sounds like
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.300]  it could be, but that's not it.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.940]  It's about the special offers.
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:22.940]  And that's going to be
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:23.940]  And how do you feel about that?
[01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.020]  Are you okay with that?
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.580]  Yeah, I actually am.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:32.980]  Because honestly, the 3% cashback is the main reason I got the card.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:39.180]  If they didn't offer 3% cashback on Apple purchases, I don't know that I would have
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:43.700]  signed up because I know I'm getting more cashback than I would through my Amex.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:49.380]  And I know I spend an awful lot of money at Apple on an annual basis with iPhones and
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:55.460]  iPads and iTunes and stuff like that.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:02.100]  3% versus roughly 2% and getting cashback instead of silly Amex points is worth it for
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100]  me.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:08.700]  So knowing that there's other places that I could go and get 3% is definitely something
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.700]  I want to know about.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.420]  No, I agree.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.180]  It makes perfect sense.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:20.300]  And I think we all kind of knew that the Apple Card was going to be popular just because
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.420]  Apple was putting out this card.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:27.200]  It's going to be popular among tech because they want to try and poke holes in it.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.260]  And it's going to be popular with a lot of people because they want that titanium card.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:39.340]  But looking at it, it actually looks like a good card.
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.980]  Yeah, it really does.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:48.220]  The other thing, too, I want to say, talking to Apple, was the other question that Nicole
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:56.300]  Nguyen's article brought up, and people rightly said, without a website, how do you get your
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.660]  year's worth of statements?
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:03.160]  Let's say it's April and it's time to do your taxes and you want to bring your credit card
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:08.300]  statement and give it to your accountant to go through and figure out what you can deduct
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.300]  and stuff like that.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.740]  How do you do that if there's no website?
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.460]  Nobody has it yet, I don't think, because everybody's so new that nobody's gotten one.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:24.940]  But in the Apple card, if you go to the dot, dot, dot again, and you scroll down or somewhere,
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.420]  where do you go?
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.700]  There's somewhere you can go.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.340]  And oh, card information, if you go to card information or nope, that's not it.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:37.260]  Well, there's somewhere you can go and it says statements.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:44.940]  And every month, there will be a statement that you can download or share that will give
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:50.660]  you a PDF of your month's statement, so you can do that.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.980]  So you will be able to do that and they will collect, so you could wait till April and
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.620]  then just go back and get your August, September, October, November, December, January, February,
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.940]  get all of your statements for those months.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.220]  Send them to your Mac, do whatever you want, print them.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:10.340]  So there is actually a way.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:19.740]  It's not just lost in the shuffle of the little iPhone notifications where you get that.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:28.300]  Those are the little things that you expect and they are in there.
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.340]  They're waiting for you.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]  Here's where you go.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]  I like that.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:35.940]  You go to your Apple card in the wallet and then it shows you the fake card and then right
[01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.400]  underneath it, it says total balance.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:43.380]  So when you click the total balance thing, it gives you your outstanding balance, tells
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.820]  you your new spending, tells you your daily cash, what you just got back and then it says
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.820]  statements.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.740]  So mine says no statements because my card is only like a week old.
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:59.580]  But as the months go by, there will be a list of statements there that you can download.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:03.380]  So they've thought this through pretty well.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:13.900]  Are you going to transfer a lot of your regular credit card bills to the Apple card or are
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:19.980]  you going to just kind of see how it goes?
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:28.580]  I'm going to see how it goes because I still do like the Amex and for roughly 2%, I'm not
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.580]  sure what to do.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.580]  I don't know.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.740]  What about moving all of your automatic Apple purchase?
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.900]  Oh, definitely.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:38.980]  All the Apple stuff is already there.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.220]  I mean, it's a no brainer not to.
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:42.620]  3% is too much.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:49.060]  And again, we're arguing about the difference between 1%, 2% to 3%, but 1% is 1%.
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:50.700]  You know what I mean?
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.700]  It's money.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]  Right.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.700]  Exactly.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:58.180]  Well, I would do it too.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.340]  So did Amy get a card too?
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.340]  No.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:04.780]  I mean, one of the weird things about this card is you can't get a joint card or at least
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.380]  not yet.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:12.420]  Like our Amex is actually all of our other credit cards are joint accounts.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:16.820]  The Amex is technically in my name, but Amy has a card.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:24.520]  The American Airlines card is in her name, but I have a card.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.300]  That's why a lot of cards are in families.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.080]  Well, I think most, but there's no option for that with Apple cards.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.680]  So if you and your significant other, your spouse want to both get Apple card, you both
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.220]  get an Apple card and you have your own account.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:45.420]  I don't know if that's good or bad.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:52.100]  And some parents, you'll learn this when Jonas is older, but you get a card for your kid
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.760]  too sometimes if they're going away on a trip, you want to make sure that they have that
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.980]  security of they'll never be stopped.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:00.980]  You know what?
[01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:04.200]  We actually, he, Jonas actually, we got him on our Amex just for that reason.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200]  I mean, he doesn't use it.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:13.140]  I mean, and he was told, you know, you know, we get alerts as soon as the card is used.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:17.080]  I forget how long he's had it, but he's never, he's a good kid.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.600]  He's never, and he's not stupid.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.240]  So he's never abused it, but it's exactly for that reason.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:28.780]  Just in case something happens, he's got a credit card that he can use, you know, to
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:35.880]  get home or to do for whatever, um, you know, it's modern parenting, you know, yes.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.160]  It's the same reason kids all have phones now and you can GPS track them.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.160]  Yep.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.000]  It's so weird.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  I know.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.360]  I used to get, uh, my father used to give me a, uh, make sure I had a dime to make a
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.280]  phone call at the pay phone.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.680]  I remember that.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:53.680]  Yeah.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.360]  And, and, uh, a little bit of walking around money, you know?
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.720]  So if you go into a hockey game, you might need some fry.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.320]  Now this, this is obviously, you know, back a bit.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:08.440]  So he would give me like $5 or something like that.
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:14.360]  And you know, you can get some fries and something to drink and go to a hockey game as we all
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360]  did.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:20.580]  Um, and you know, at the very end of the night, if you spent all of your money and you needed
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.760]  a ride home, here's your dime.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.040]  You can go to the pay phone and, and call.
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.040]  Yeah.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.040]  Uh, it's a very different, I mean, we could do a whole show on what a different world
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:36.420]  it is, but it's weird.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.680]  Like the kids growing up in this world, they there's, they so accept it.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.160]  Like it doesn't seem to bother Jonas at all that we can find my friends and locate him
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.640]  any, any moment of any day.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.220]  Like it doesn't, that would have bothered me as a 15 year old a lot.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:00.700]  And I wasn't a particularly bad kid, but I definitely went places I wouldn't have wanted
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.480]  my parents to know about.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:03.480]  Well yeah.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:06.240]  Or I would tell my parents I was going to so-and-so's house, but I was really going
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.280]  to such and such as house, uh, didn't want them to know, you know, I mean, my parents
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:17.360]  are still learning things that I did when I was a kid and they're horrified.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:20.640]  Oh, that's okay though.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:28.720]  I mean, but you know, so anyway, when, when apple first announced the apple card, I was
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.720]  somewhat critical.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.400]  Like I think my quip was more or less what's next payday loans at the retail apple stores.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.920]  Um, wow.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:43.980]  Well I'm still, I'm still, I think this is a very good credit card.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:44.980]  I do.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:46.540]  I think the cash back system is great.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.920]  I think that the, the breakdown of categorization of stuff is great.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.560]  I think the fact that they give you the cash back on a daily basis is fantastic.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.920]  Like they're not holding that to float the money.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.160]  Like they're really giving you that cash back about as fast as they can in a very convenient
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.960]  fashion that you can spend, um, you know, use the same way you use your apple card.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:13.220]  Um, so as a credit card, it's really hard to criticize it.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:15.280]  Even the fact that you can't have a joint account.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:19.080]  Like I said, I don't know if that's a bad thing or a good thing because it's so personal,
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:25.400]  you know, the fact that, that you're spending habits and stuff, you know, would you want
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.760]  to be mixed in with your significant other as opposed to telling me how much money I'm
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.920]  blowing on beer?
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.920]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.920]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920]  Yeah.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:37.920]  Yeah.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.920]  I, I, I get it.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.460]  I just, I think it would be helpful for a lot of people.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.600]  I think a lot of people would really like that feature.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.240]  I mean, for me, it doesn't really matter.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:54.360]  Um, when I get an apple carrot, then it's going to be my apple carrot and you know what?
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.600]  One reason that it's good to have a joint card.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:01.800]  I mean, Amy is, uh, I'll admit is the bill payer of the family.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:06.200]  Um, which is why we're, thankfully, which is why we're never late paying things like
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:11.240]  the mortgage because it's not, it's not left to me.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:17.260]  Um, and so for example, the fact that she has one Amex bill to pay as opposed to two
[01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.600]  is one less thing to take care of every month.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:24.720]  I think one of the reasons that's mitigated with apple card is that it's so easy to pay,
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.720]  right?
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.080]  Like I think, you know, a, you can pay it at any time.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.860]  So like I, you know, my, I could take my week old card right now and push two buttons and
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.040]  pay off my $87 balance right now.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.320]  Um, but if I just wait for my statement to end, I'm going to get a notification and I
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.680]  can say, pay it.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:50.040]  And then, you know, you hit up, it, it, it's, it, it's the minimal, the least you can possibly,
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.760]  you wouldn't want it to do less, right?
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.240]  You wouldn't, I wouldn't want it to pay automatically.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:59.620]  I don't think I'd like to know, here's what my balance was for the month and say, okay,
[01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:00.620]  pay it.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.620]  Right.
[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:08.160]  Um, so I, you know, it, it, it doesn't seem like a huge hassle if you and your significant
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.880]  other both have a card that you're now doubling the number of, of bills you have to pay every
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.840]  month because it's so easy.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:20.720]  Um, my, you know, my biggest complaint is honestly the interest rates.
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:28.480]  Uh, and most of the people I know who got an apple card, including me, got the 13% interest
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.320]  rate, 12.99.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.400]  But let's face it, that's 13%.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.500]  That seems to be the lowest interest rate that you can get with apple card.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:45.440]  And it is also a lower interest rate than most credit cards seem to offer today.
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.560]  Um, some people, I think that they say that their interest rates, depending on your credit
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.480]  worthiness, go up to like 24% or something like that.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.040]  Um, I think that's too high.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.840]  I think the whole industry, and again, even if apple card is leading the industry on the
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:08.640]  interest rates that they're, that they're bestowing upon their customers, I think the
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.880]  whole industry is rotten.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.900]  I mean, would, would, of course it is.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.320]  That's how they make their money.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.720]  But 20, 20, 30 years ago, like when I was in college and I first got a credit card,
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:26.960]  the interest rates were like 7%, 8%, you know, like, uh, uh, I realized they learned
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.840]  they could make more, but why can't I, why not expect apple to do better, right?
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:40.960]  I suppose, you know, and I, I just think that if the best that they can offer for someone
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:48.040]  with what they deemed to be the highest quality credit worthiness is 13% interest, it's that's,
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.440]  that's practical usury.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:56.120]  In my opinion, Tim Cook would never borrow money at apple for 13% interest, you know,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.800]  like when they do some of these cash back things, you know, it, it's funny for a company
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.960]  with so much cash that they've taken on debt, but they've done it because they can take
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:12.800]  debt at such a low interest rate that it's more valuable than using their cash to pay
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.060]  off the stuff that they want to do, right?
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:19.960]  So apple, apple is car, apple as a corporation is carrying a surprising amount of debt given
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.440]  how much cash they have, but it's because they took that debt at, you know, like two
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.840]  or 3% interest or something like that.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.680]  Apple would never take 13% interest.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.040]  It's, it's, it's outrageous in my opinion.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040]  You know what?
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.760]  The apple is the most, it's the richest company in the world, most powerful company in the
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.760]  world.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:43.120]  Maybe if you were the richest man in the world, you wouldn't be getting interested at 13%
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.120]  either.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120]  Right.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.760]  And I, and for people with poor credit, I get it.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:54.720]  I say if, if your credit is poor enough that you want to charge 24% interest, I can't believe
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:55.720]  my phone went off again.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:05.920]  I thought I had the hell is wrong with you would think I've done podcasts before.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:06.920]  I think it's me.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.080]  I think I'm a story off.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.080]  Yeah.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.280]  It's like I got, got like a contact Heineken high.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:18.680]  Uh, uh, R2D2 freaking out.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.480]  That's, that's the ringtone from my parents.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.880]  Nice.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:29.880]  Uh, if, if, if somebody applies for an apple card and their credit history is such that
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.400]  they want apple, you know, that Goldman Sachs deems, and I realized that these decisions
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:39.200]  are made by Goldman, not Apple, but, and they say, well, you're going to get 20, 25% interest
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.320]  20, number one, 25% interest should be illegal.
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.480]  I honestly, I'm not exaggerating.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.840]  I'm not that it's, it's just outrageous.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:51.620]  And you're, you're giving these incredibly high, genuine usury.
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:53.740]  It should be illegal, really.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:54.740]  It's just criminal.
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:24:00.520]  And I say this and I know that a lot of people in tech are libertarians and, and when I've
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.640]  criticized this publicly on during fireball, some of the response I get very reasonable
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:10.360]  to just, you know, it's, it's the best sort of, uh, I disagree with you feedback, you
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.600]  know, I, I, you know, I don't know about your readers, but you know, when I get, I disagree
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.960]  with your feedback for the most part, it, it's, it's fantastic.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.040]  I enjoy reading it.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.120]  I like to think about it.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]  Agreed.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:28.340]  The, the libertarian angle on this is if you don't like 24% interest, don't sign up for
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:29.340]  it.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.340]  Right.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.560]  You know, it's not like they're surprising you.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.360]  It's not like they're giving you, uh, they're not telling you what the interest rate is.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.520]  And then you find out after you carry a balance, they're telling you before, you know, you
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:47.400]  know, you go through the signup process and before you finalize and say, yes, give me
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400]  an apple card.
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.460]  They tell you, here's your credit limit, X thousand dollars.
[01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:57.000]  Here's your interest rate, 13% or 18% or whatever.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.600]  Hit this button to get the apple card under these terms or hit cancel.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600]  And you don't.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:09.840]  You're, you know what you're signing up for, but my take on this is that I don't think
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:16.080]  I think part of a functioning government in a, in a representative democracy is that the
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:28.320]  government looks out for the people and that I don't think it's, it's your duty to be mathematically
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:40.120]  adept enough to know just how, how troublesome 25% interests can be and how quickly it can
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.140]  escalate that you can, you know, you can buy something for a couple of hundred dollars
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:50.040]  and if you decide I'm going to pay this over time because that's why I got the credit card,
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.700]  uh, you know, which is, you know, part of the reason some people have a credit card
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.140]  is they want to purchase something.
[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:59.340]  They don't, you know, purchase a $500 device or let's say a thousand dollar iPhone and
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.880]  they don't want to pay for it all at once.
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:07.160]  But at something like 24% or 25% interest, you can be making minimum payments and, and
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.320]  you're for life and you're never catch up.
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.360]  You're never going to, you're never going to get there.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.400]  That's how, how high the interest is.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.920]  I honestly think that should be criminal.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.360]  I realized Apple's not out of line on this.
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.880]  I realized Goldman's not out of line with the industry.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.520]  I realized that 13% is actually good for the industry, but I just say the whole industry
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.160]  is rotten and, and these interest rates, why not lead the way and there would be a selling
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.160]  point.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.760]  Why not say that our interest rates go as low as 7% or 6% if you have good credit and
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:41.720]  you know, we'll, we'll be way and you know, it's a mixed bag because obviously the people
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.760]  who are probably most credit worthy and the people who would qualify for the lowest rate
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:48.800]  are the people who are most likely to pay their credit card balance every month.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.680]  Well, and that's how they make money too.
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:58.800]  They get the people that do leave the balances and but you know, I, I don't know, I don't
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.880]  know the credit card industry well enough to be able to say this as, as fact, but I'm
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:09.000]  not sure that Apple was really in a position to be able to negotiate the rates as well
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.500]  as, as what you think that they may have been because they're not the bank Goldman is right.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:22.120]  So you know, we could be looking at a situation in, in three to five years where, where Apple
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.160]  will say, you know what?
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:28.600]  We've topped out the interest rate for the Apple card at 15%.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:34.280]  Now everybody's rate will, the highest it'll be is 15 because they do have that power at
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280]  that point.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:37.960]  I hope that they're going that way.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:44.840]  As far as, as people are concerned, it, it bothers me personally that there are so many
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:52.140]  people in credit card debt, like tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt and the stress
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.640]  that that must bring them as an individual and a family.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:07.560]  And you know, when there are a lot of resources available to people though, and it's not necessarily
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:12.760]  do I wish the credit card companies could be made to cap an interest rate?
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.880]  Yeah, of course, absolutely.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:24.680]  But you know, people, if you're putting, um, an iPhone on your, your credit card because
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.700]  you can't afford and you see no way in the next year that you'll be able to afford to
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.160]  buy it, then I think instead of looking at getting the credit card, you need to look
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:40.040]  at whether or not you should be getting the phone, not the credit card.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:47.840]  And yeah, you know, I, I understand that it's easy for me to say that I, and I'm not trying
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.560]  to offend anybody.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:56.640]  I'm just trying to say that, you know, there's, there's two ways to look at this, this whole
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.640]  thing.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.020]  And, you know, no matter how low or how high the interest rates are for credit cards, some
[01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.860]  people are still going to get it.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.200]  You could tell the year interest rate is 50% right.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.200]  Okay.
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.200]  Give me the card.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.400]  I think the government should regulate the maximum rate and I think it should be a lot
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.040]  lower than 20 something percent.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.040]  I really do.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.960]  Even for people with poor credit and if they're, you know, and, and if the maximum rate were
[01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:27.000]  15% or 16% and a bank said, well, at only 16% it's not, you know, we don't think this,
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.440]  it's worth giving it to this person because they're so risky.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.640]  We really want the higher rate.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:37.840]  Well then don't give them a credit card, you know, uh, anyway, that's my take on it anyway.
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.840]  It's a good card.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.640]  I didn't get the physical card yet.
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.880]  Uh, supposedly it's to, it tells me it's coming tomorrow.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.920]  Uh, so it's after this podcast.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.160]  Did you see the thing where they, they, people, people were freaking out because it's says
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.520]  it gets stained by leather and denim.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.680]  So that's what I posted that song last week.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.680]  I think it was Friday.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:05.840]  Uh, it's an old metal song called denim and leather by Saxon.
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.880]  And I said, this is the new apple card theme song.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.880]  Of course it has nothing to do with the apple car, but denim and leather just seemed like
[01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.360]  a, a great song to post and it is a great song.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.680]  Um, so yeah, do you care about that?
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:24.320]  I don't care what I wrote, you know, and again, we'll see, I'll get the car tomorrow.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.640]  I guess I'll keep it in my wallet.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:32.120]  I mean, my wallet is leather, um, as a lot of peoples are and I do wear, I do wear blue
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.280]  jeans most of the year.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:41.520]  Um, I suspect, and this is what I wrote, I suspect that they're, most of my credit cards
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.520]  get scuffed up.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.320]  I went through my wallet when this broke.
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:49.040]  My first reaction when I saw this story was that maybe apple screwed up.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.280]  My first knee jerk reaction was to just make fun of them and say, well, it's a good thing
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.760]  nobody has leather wallets or wears blue jeans.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.000]  But then I thought about it and I read the actual support document, you know, it's, it's
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.920]  under the category of how to clean your apple card and like what to use and what not to
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:05.920]  use.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.760]  Um, and then, you know, and they mentioned this, that it might be stained by leather
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.240]  or denim.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:15.060]  Um, the more I thought about it, the more, and I looked at, I took out my wallet and
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.480]  looked at my cards and they're all, they're all scuffed up and scratched, you know, and
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.480]  they say, don't put it in the same pocket as another card.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:21.480]  It might get scratched.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.960]  All my credit cards are scratched for the most part.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.360]  Uh, like my, my driver's license is scratched.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:32.360]  I mean, none of them, they're mostly good condition, um, but they all definitely look
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.360]  used.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.520]  None of them look like they're in mint condition with the exception of my Amex, which is actually,
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.080]  it's, it's also made of metal.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:43.360]  I don't know what kind of metal it is, but, uh, the platinum Amex is made of metal.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.300]  It's sort of, it sort of feels like a weapon.
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:47.360]  Like you could like, like throwing stars.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360]  Right.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.360]  Yeah.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.960]  Uh, but, but the Amex card, like I told you earlier in the show was just replaced a couple
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.160]  months ago.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.240]  So it's, you know, the fact that it's made of metal is obviously makes it more durable
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240]  than a plastic card.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:06.800]  Um, but I've only had this card for a couple of months, so, uh, you know, I, I forget.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:13.920]  I, I, I'm pretty sure like the, like the signature strip on my previous metal Amex card was frayed
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.160]  and worn, you know, like there's, there's definitely wear and tear on it after a year
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.160]  or two.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.240]  Um, uh, I don't care.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.680]  I mean, my credit, of course your credit cards look used.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:27.640]  So I really do think that this support document is there for the benefit of the obsessive,
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:33.840]  the apple obsessives who want to keep their apple card, pristine mint condition and okay,
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.560]  if you want to keep it mint condition, here's what you want to do.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560]  It's a credit card.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560]  Yeah.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:45.880]  Just, I mean, when I saw that and you know, the whole denim and leather thing, I thought,
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:46.880]  who cares?
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.240]  Because if apple didn't post this, then people would have put it in their pocket and then
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:57.240]  they would've said, Oh my God, my card, it's, it's uh, you know, discolored well, you know,
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.240]  they posted something.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.240]  Yes.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.240]  It could get discolored.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.240]  Don't care.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240]  It's a credit card.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]  Every once in a while.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.520]  I guess the thing in the back of some people's minds is that every once in a while, although
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:10.280]  I don't think off the top of my head, I don't think it's happened recently, but every once
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.360]  in a while apple comes out with a product that is too fragile.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:20.900]  I mean, the one that really comes to mind was in the one generation of iPod nano circa.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:23.480]  It was around 2005 or 2006.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:24.480]  Do you remember this?
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:31.560]  There is an iPod nano where the, the front of it was, you could scratch it by looking
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:32.760]  at it.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.760]  You remember this?
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.040]  I don't know if I do.
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.560]  Oh, I, well, let's, I have to put this in the show notes.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.560]  I'll find it.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:46.720]  But there was an iPod nano generation around 2005 that was so easily scratched that it
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.860]  was, it really made you wonder how the hell it ever shipped because it must've, they must
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:58.600]  not have, it really must not have stress tested it at all.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.320]  I'm trying to think of other examples.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.720]  I guess the, the titanium G4 power books, and I guess that's the other thing in people's
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.420]  minds cause this card is made of titanium.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:14.360]  The first titanium G4 power books, which, which were the, the first ones that weren't
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:19.160]  made of plastic, you know, like black plastic and they switched to the, you know, what looks
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:27.040]  like a modern Mac book pro, still a silver colored metal power book, but it was titanium.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.360]  It was before they, they, they switched to aluminum that they'd flake over time.
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.440]  It was sort of like that titanium was sort of a painted titanium and the more you used
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:41.520]  it, it, it showed a lot of wear and tear.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.760]  And I guess people are worried that this card will be like that, but I don't, I don't think
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.800]  that the card is, I think it's a very different sort of titanium.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  Yeah.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.120]  I'm, I'm not worried about, about that at all.
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:01.600]  You know, I, I get, I don't know if I'm looking at this wrong or what, but when I look at
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:07.800]  this card, I see a credit card, you know, is it going to be cool?
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:08.800]  Sure.
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.360]  Yeah, absolutely cool.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  But it's still, it's a credit card.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360]  You're supposed to use it.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  It's a credit card.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.160]  I mean, it's supposed to bang around in your wallet.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.360]  And when you do use it at a place that doesn't have Apple pay, you're giving it to them and
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.360]  they're swiping it.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:29.320]  And I just do not care that much about, I mean, if you want your aluminum or your titanium
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:36.280]  credit card to be pristine, then frame it and put it on your, your counter.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.720]  Otherwise it's a credit card.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.000]  So some people speculate that they may, and I don't think this is true at all.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.720]  I think that this card, because it's made of titanium should be actually very durable.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:46.720]  It should be very cool.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.720]  I can't speak to it yet.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:48.720]  I don't have it.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.720]  I do have friends who have it.
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:53.600]  They think it is a very cool card.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.600]  You know, which is the thing.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.640]  I mean, it's cooler to have a cool card than a lame card, but of course still who cares?
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.520]  It's a fricking credit card cares.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:04.120]  It's interesting to think about where you still use a card.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.920]  Here's the, the one of the pieces of speculation I saw floating around is that Apple made the
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.040]  card delicate to encourage people to use Apple pay.
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.300]  And you do get, you get more cash, but you get 2% cash back on an Apple pay payment.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:20.040]  And when you use the card itself, you only get 1% cash back.
[01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.320]  So that is clearly motivation.
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.640]  I mean, there, I mean, there's no other explanation for it than that.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.640]  They, they would prefer you use Apple pay than use the card.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.520]  You get a full extra percent cash back.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.520]  Yeah.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:39.680]  And what's interesting to think about is where you still have to use the card itself.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:47.680]  And the two places that come to mind and, and it's very U S specific are, can you think
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.320]  of the two places where you have to use a card?
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.320]  Costco.
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.320]  Well, what, no, I don't know about, I don't shop at Costco.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.240]  Well, restaurants, right?
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:02.480]  You go to, when you go to a sit down restaurant, the bill comes, you have to put your card
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.840]  in the bill and then the server takes the card away.
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:06.840]  Okay.
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.240]  Now you've been to Europe, right?
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:09.240]  Yep.
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.960]  In Europe, they come to your table with a little card reader.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.160]  And yeah, they do that in Canada and a lot too.
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.160]  Yeah.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.160]  So everywhere.
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160]  Well, yeah.
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160]  So I didn't know they did in Canada too.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:24.400]  So it's pretty much, it's pretty much like our, uh, uh, systems of measurement, uh, Fahrenheit
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.680]  miles and inches.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:31.720]  It's, it's a U S thing only and it's, you know, and once you think about it, it is weird
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:36.160]  that you just hand your credit card to a complete stranger and they walk away for five minutes
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.960]  and then come back when you own a new motorcycle or TV.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:45.240]  Well, it obviously doesn't happen a lot, but it's quite possibly how it happened to me
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.240]  a couple months ago.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240]  I don't know.
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:51.000]  But in, you know, most other Western countries, they come to your table with a little handheld
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  reader and I guess you used to have to insert it.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.080]  Maybe now you can just wave it at it, you know, and get the NFC type thing.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.540]  And now you can use Apple pay to pay.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:06.600]  But anyway, most, uh, almost all restaurants here in the U S you still have to pay by giving,
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.100]  handing your card over.
[01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:10.440]  And then the other one is gas stations.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.960]  Um, and there definitely are gas stations that take Apple pay.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.680]  Um, but a lot don't, maybe most don't.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:29.920]  And I'm talking to people at Apple about this, uh, they mentioned gas stations and they said
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.840]  that one of the problems with gas stations, like one of the reasons that Apple pay has
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:41.620]  been able to spread as quickly as it has is that at this point it's hard to get a point
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:45.360]  of sale system that doesn't take Apple pay.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:51.820]  So like whether it, you know, so whether you're a new store or, or counter restaurant or new
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.400]  whatever and you're getting, you know, well, let's get a point of sale system to buy stuff.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.260]  There's the, just about anything you can buy takes the NFC payment so you can just waive
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:02.960]  your Apple pay at it.
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.600]  Uh, and even existing businesses, you know, they, they eventually turn them over and get
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  new ones.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.480]  So anybody with a new one, it turns over.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:15.040]  Um, and there's some regulations from the credit card companies where they're insisting,
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.180]  you know, that people be, you know, take the ones that take the chip reader for extra security.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:22.160]  And if you get the one with the chip reader, which the credit card companies are starting
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.760]  to require, you get the Apple pay NFC stuff for free cause it's the same system.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760]  Right.
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:37.760]  Um, gas stations are different because the card readers are built into the pumps.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.840]  So it's not like you just get an, the gas station just needs to buy a couple of new
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.800]  credit card readers and now they can take Apple pay.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.760]  They would have to replace the actual pumps, which is obviously a much more significant
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.760]  expense.
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.760]  Yeah.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:59.600]  And so gas stations actually get exemptions from like the credit card companies, you know,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.000]  that say, Hey, by such and such date, you have, you know, retailers have to be able
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.520]  to take chip payments and stuff like that.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:11.120]  Um, gas stations have like a special exemption to that in a much longer period of time before
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.360]  they have to do it.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:22.520]  So gas stations and, uh, and restaurants, restaurants, you need a car, uh, I guess we
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.840]  can move on from Apple pay.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:29.000]  Why don't I, why don't I talk about one of our, one of our friendly sponsors, um, is
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.640]  another, it's a favorite of mine fracture.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.720]  Look, all of us, I don't know anybody who doesn't take and share photos online.
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:42.760]  Uh, very few of those photos are ever printed though, and fewer end up on display in your
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.760]  home.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.200]  They're stuck on your phone, they're stuck on your devices.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.200]  Focus on the moments that mean the most in your life by turning your favorite digital
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.860]  memories into meaningful photo decor.
[01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:58.140]  Fracture prints are made by printing directly on glass and they come ready to display right
[01:40:58.140 --> 01:40:59.680]  out of the box.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.460]  They have everything you need.
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:04.480]  If it's a small one, they have everything you need to prop it up on your desk or your
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:05.860]  mantle wherever you want to put it.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:09.540]  If it's one bigger one that you want to hang, everything you need, including the wall hanger
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:12.200]  is included in the box.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:13.800]  They're edge to edge.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]  You don't need a frame.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800]  There is no frame.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.640]  It's just a piece of glass with the photo going completely edge to edge.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:28.200]  It's a gorgeous look, goes with any interior decor, uh, and they're all handmade in Gainesville,
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.360]  Florida from us source materials.
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.920]  Uh, it's a green company fracture.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.960]  They operate a carbon neutral factory.

[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:48.920]  fracture?
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:49.920]  Just remember the talk show.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.420]  Go to fracture dot me.

[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.500]  I'm aware of load up on them.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:05.880]  I know it's only August, but they, they sell out for Christmas, knock it out, knock it
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.400]  out to buy a bunch, get a bunch of photos from your summer vacation or something like
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.400]  that.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:11.400]  Save them up, give them to people for Christmas.
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.720]  A great company.
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:19.820]  So remember that fracture dot me and remember to tell them that you came from here.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:29.580]  Did you, uh, do you see, uh, Gurman's a big, uh, fall preview rumor Palooza, uh, pretty
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.580]  detailed.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:37.320]  Uh, it's actually, even by Gurman standards, I thought surprisingly detailed, uh, sort
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:43.440]  of a look ahead at what Mark Gurman sources are saying are coming from Apple this fall.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:48.040]  I mean, uh, surprise, surprise, iPhones and new watches in September.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:53.200]  Um, but one of the things he said, and I forget where this rumor, this rumor leaked on Twitter
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.460]  from somebody whose name I didn't recognize, but one of those, there's like that weird
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:02.240]  subculture of Apple and phone leakers who, who exist solely on Twitter, like they don't
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.240]  even have blogs.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.600]  They just sort of, you know, like, uh, uh, you know, they post like, they get like a
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.200]  picture of the Samsung galaxy 10 a month before it comes out and they just post a picture
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.040]  on Twitter or something like that.
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:23.800]  Uh, somebody a couple of weeks ago, uh, just tweeted ambiguously that, uh, hmm, pro iPhones.
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:27.160]  I don't know if that makes sense, you know, that they're going to call the new iPhones
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.600]  the, they're going to use the word pro.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.160]  Um, and Gurman obviously thinks so too.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:36.160]  That was part of the lead of his, uh, yeah, he does.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:42.160]  Um, so there's a couple of interesting stuff in here to talk about, but, um, what does
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.160]  it say here?
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:47.000]  Apple incorporate is ready, readying a clutch of new hardware for the coming weeks and months,
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.160]  including quote, pro iPhones, upgrades to iPads and its largest laptop in years.
[01:43:52.160 --> 01:44:01.200]  Um, I've been, so anybody who's over the last few years has been wagering in Las Vegas on
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:07.160]  my predictions of Apple product names is bankrupt.
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:14.420]  I haven't predicted the name of an Apple product in a long time because I, and I've been leaning,
[01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:20.920]  you know, endorsing calling the high end app iPhones pro, whether they're just called iPhone
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:27.920]  pro or iPhone something pro like iPhone 10 pro or 11 pro, um, for years.
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:31.200]  And every time I bring it up, people say, well, what's pro, you know, there's nothing
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:36.520]  pro about an iPhone, um, uh, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.800]  And so far I've been wrong.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.840]  They have never used the word pro in an iPhone, even though they've, you know, they now have
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:49.480]  iPad pros, uh, to go along with Mac book pros, which they've had, uh, ever since they switched
[01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.120]  the name from power book to Mac book back in 2006 or seven when they switched from power
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  PC to Intel.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.760]  Um, and of course the Mac pro, which we're waiting with a bated breath this fall, a pro
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.840]  version of all of those, but they don't have a pro version of the iPhone.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.800]  And they say, well, there's nothing pro about it.
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.840]  Pro means professional and iPhones are for everyone, even the best ones.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:22.640]  Uh, I don't think that's what I, my, my retort to that has been sometimes when Apple says
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:30.560]  pro, they literally mean professional Mac pro is the obvious or I Mac pro as well, right?
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:34.980]  The Mac pro and I Mac pro are obviously meant for professionals.
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:42.480]  The only reason to buy an I Mac pro instead of a regular five K I Mac is if you have genuine
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:49.680]  professional needs for the truly significant performance differences between agreed because
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.960]  then I, a regular I Mac is a very, I've got one that's a four years old and it is still
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.840]  as a, there's nothing slow on it for me.
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:02.800]  I don't do anything that, that ever makes the fan come on.
[01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:06.320]  I don't do anything that ever makes the beach ball come up.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:14.720]  So, uh, you know, I Mac pro is obviously for genuine professionals.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.440]  The Mac pro coming later this year, I don't know if it's a month, I don't know if it's
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.440]  two months.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:24.920]  I don't know if it'll be December 30th, uh, obviously meant for truly professionals.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:34.680]  The pro display XDR that starts at $5,000 without a stand is truly meant not just for
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:39.780]  professionals, but for a very narrow swath of professionals.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:47.560]  If you get one of those, then I'll just stand behind the screen and hold it for you.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.080]  You know what people can make some, and that might be a good way for like neighborhood
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:51.080]  kids to make money.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.520]  You know, if you want to say stand there, you want to save money on a thousand dollars
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.360]  stand, you just pay, pay a neighborhood kid to hold your monitor in front of you.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:05.560]  Um, but I would say the Mac book pros have, you know, certainly are used by professionals
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:11.280]  absolutely but are also used by people who just want, uh, a Mac book pro is their regular
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.280]  laptop.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:17.960]  And for example, if one of the things you want in a laptop is a 15 inch display as opposed
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.640]  to a 13 inch display, guess what?
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:24.920]  You're getting a Mac book pro, whether you, whether you have professional needs or not.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:32.600]  But if you look at that though, I think Apple's reasoning behind all of this is solid.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:37.120]  If you're a student or you're somebody that flies a lot, you're an executive, you just
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.320]  need to get some work done on the road.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:45.480]  Any of those other computers will suit your needs perfectly.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.300]  Not just screen size, power wise, everything else.
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:51.440]  Those computers are perfectly fine.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:54.000]  They fit everything that you need.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.440]  A Mac book pro, you know, that's what I use on a daily basis and I love the pro.
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:03.440]  I love it cause I don't really have to carry it around.
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:08.240]  I, you know, even when I do, I throw up my suitcase and go and it's not that big of a
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.680]  deal, but you know, yeah, you're right.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:18.400]  If you want a 15 inch screen, then you're going for a pro model.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:25.480]  Notice what Apple means by pro is deluxe or better or best and they just don't, you know,
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.880]  they just like the word pro for its connotations to mean that.
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.060]  And I would say the iPad pro is the perfect example of that where what's the difference
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:41.020]  between the just plain iPad or now that they've brought the name back, the iPad air and the
[01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:42.860]  iPad pro.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:48.600]  Now there are some people who truly use an iPad in a professional way, um, you know,
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.960]  there's artists, you know, who do it for illustration.
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:56.160]  I told this story on my show a couple of weeks ago where, um, earlier in July, my family,
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:59.780]  we were down in Florida, you know, doing the theme park stuff and we were in universal
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.040]  and you know, those, uh, you know, you go to a theme park and they have the caricature
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.040]  artists.
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:07.220]  You can sit down and pay, you know, 20 bucks or whatever and they'll, they'll make a funny
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:12.920]  drawing of you, um, and they had a, you know, a shaded pavilion where there were three or
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:18.360]  four artists doing those and three of them were doing it the old fashioned way on a piece
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.680]  of paper with colored pencils or crowns or whatever.
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.480]  And the fourth was using a 13 inch iPad pro.
[01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:25.480]  Wow.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:30.000]  And I, you know, I, you know me, I didn't sit to get my caricature taken.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.040]  That's not my style, but I did ask the guy was walking by and I just said, Hey, how do
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:35.200]  you like using this for that?
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.560]  And he just turned to me and he said, I love it.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.240]  I mean, and you know, and he was, I would say he was like 60 years old.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.240]  He's, and it seemed like maybe he'd been doing it, you know, he'd been doing this for a long
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:44.240]  time.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:50.100]  Uh, wasn't like a young kid and I, I, you know, and I took a quick glance at the person
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:51.100]  he was drawing.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:52.520]  He was actually very talented.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:57.160]  It was a very, very accurate and humorous, flattering caricature.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.740]  Um, that's a professional use, right?
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:00.740]  That's totally pro.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:01.740]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:05.680]  You know, it, this is a guy who, you know, for eight hours a day sits there and draws
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.440]  people's pictures for money.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:11.800]  Um, I know, you know, there's a bunch, they don't even tell you about it anymore.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:15.360]  They used to like make a big deal out of it, but you know, every, every, every week the
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.560]  new Yorker has an illustrated cover that's part of the gimmick of the new Yorker.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.760]  I know a lot of their regular stable of artists do their work on the iPad pro.
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.840]  You could be a professional who doesn't even use the pencil though.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:33.360]  It could be a professional who does, you know, uh, you know, uh, a lot of our friends in
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.480]  this whole racket or, you know, full time on the iPad, you know, uh, you know, Federico,
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:45.440]  everything Federico is obviously using his iPad in a, a, a truly professional sense.
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.840]  Uh, but my wife has an iPad pro.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:53.360]  She has the big one and she absolutely loves it as sworn that she will.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.800]  She couldn't believe at first she really was reluctant and she was like, this is too big.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.800]  This is too big.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.800]  She's like, I can never go back.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.840]  It's like, like once in a while she'll pick up my iPad by accident.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.760]  She by what is this tiny thing?
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:11.440]  She doesn't use it in a professional sense, you know, just email, email, I message web
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.400]  browsing games, you know, watching movies and TV shows.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.400]  She just likes it.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.520]  She just likes the bigger screen.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.440]  She likes the edge to edge, uh, you know, I love that.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  Yeah.
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:25.640]  So you can use it, you know, that's the ones where they mean deluxe.
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:29.320]  You can use it in a professional sense, but there's very good reasons that somebody would
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.360]  buy an iPad pro even though they're never going to use it in a professional sense at
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.360]  all.
[01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:38.000]  And I think that that same use of the word pro would apply to the high end iPhones.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.120]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:49.040]  I think that's very, uh, uh, a very good way to, to look at how they're going to do things.
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:55.600]  Uh, so I guess, and so it's interesting because one of the things that seldom leaks, and I
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.700]  seldom, if ever leaks the tooth to like the holiest of holies and secret of secrets at
[01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:12.400]  Apple are product product names and prices because they don't have to be pre keynote
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.400]  event.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.760]  They don't really have to be the circle of people who knows what they are, doesn't have
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.920]  to expand.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:24.880]  Whereas stuff like the fact that, you know, everybody seemingly quote unquote knows that
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.160]  they're switching to a bigger camera thing on the back with three cameras instead of
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.960]  two on the high end phones.
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.160]  But because that comes out of the supply chain and the supply chain is tens of thousands
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.800]  of people.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:44.000]  But prices and names tend not to leak because that group is like they know how to keep their
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.400]  mouth shut.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.980]  I think that they should really include you and I in that group in the future, you know,
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:54.300]  so he doesn't know the names.
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:58.720]  He's using the word pro in quotes and he doesn't speculate as to what they're actually going
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:52:59.720]  to call them.
[01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:06.520]  Like, is it going to be the iPhone 11 pro and the iPhone 11 pro max, which is probably
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:13.760]  my guess if I had to guess my guess and I have no, I want to reiterate here, I have
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.880]  no little birdies or information on this and I think my, like I said five minutes ago,
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:25.120]  my track record on iPhone names will back that up that I don't have any kind of inside
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:30.560]  information on this, but if I were to wager on what the names were going to be, I would
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:36.120]  guess that the iPhone 10 R successor, which apparently they're going to make and the big
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:41.980]  change is going to be that it's going to go from one camera to two cameras like today's
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:50.040]  10 S's and be available in similar colors.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.400]  Gurman says they're going to add green, which I didn't even remember.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:56.840]  They didn't have, I thought they did have green.
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:54:01.400]  They have enough colors where I thought green was one of them.
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:04.520]  I would guess they're just going to call that phone the iPhone 11.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.520]  That's my guess.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.440]  It'll just be, that's the iPhone 11.
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:12.440]  It's the standard iPhone 11 and for most people, if you want a brand new iPhone, that's the
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.120]  iPhone you should get.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:22.080]  I think that the 10 S, the 5.8 inch screen, the smaller of the high end ones, which will
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:31.400]  get this new square three camera array would be the iPhone 11 pro and that the big 6.5
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:38.680]  gargantuan phone will be the iPhone 11 pro max, which sounds a bit like a mouthful because
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:46.680]  now you've got four things, iPhone 11 pro max and on Twitter, people debating this,
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:52.080]  you know, I've pointed that out that that's, that's just too much, but I don't, I don't
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.140]  think it really matters because it seems to me in Apple's advertisements, like for the
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:03.560]  iPhone 10 S where there's two sizes, they just advertise iPhone 10 S. They just say
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:08.400]  iPhone 10 S, you know, shot on iPhone 10 S or something like that and they show iPhone
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.760]  10 S's and when they show the product photography in a commercial or a billboard, you can't
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.220]  really tell if it's the 6.5 inch or the 5.8 because they kind of look the same.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:23.800]  You know, you can't see, you don't know the scale and they'll just say that and then they'll
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:28.760]  use the max so that when you go in the store, you'll know, well, do I want this smaller
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:32.840]  one or do I want the bigger one, which is called max? And I don't think people are confused
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:37.320]  by that at all and I don't think it's much of a mouthful. I think the billboards and
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.800]  like the commercials will just say iPhone 11 pro.
[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.960]  What do you like? What size? Oh, I like the smaller one, the 5.8. Yeah. It's just, I like
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:53.880]  the bigger one. I, you know, I could see it, you know, and, you know, as my eyesight, as
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:57.640]  my close eyesight, you know, gets worse, I can certainly see, you know, having, you know,
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.640]  being able to blow up the text a little bit and still see more stuff. I mean, I'm on the
[01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.300]  fence. Amy again, switched last year. She, she on, you know, it wasn't like I said, hey,
[01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.440]  you should get the big ones. I want to, you know, performing an experiment on her, see
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.840]  if she likes it. She wanted it. And again, just like when she got the bigger iPad, she
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:21.800]  hated it for a couple of days and now she's totally sold on it and feels like it's no
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.440]  big deal. Can't believe it. She thought it was a big deal, but she carries her phone
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.880]  in her purse, not in a pocket for the most part.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:37.120]  I carry my phone in my pocket. Obviously my pockets would be bigger, but I, I just, you
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:44.940]  know, the, I don't mind the bigger size. I actually like the bigger size, but you know,
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:53.320]  my eyes for close up are getting bad and have been for years. So I, I wear readers and I
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:57:02.120]  need those when I have the text, even though I zoomed up the display a little bit. It still
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.480]  helps to have it. I mean, I don't want to Jack the font up all the way so that I'm reading
[01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:14.260]  a one word, a line either. So the bigger size to me is, is the way to go, but everybody
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:19.300]  has their own preference, you know? Yeah. So the other thing, as soon as this naming
[01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:25.480]  discussion came up on Twitter, the other obvious as a, you know, not just going to God almighty,
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:31.720]  please don't let them go Roman numeral 11. I'm so, Oh my God, I please just go one, one.
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:37.080]  I really can't imagine that they would go X one. I can't, I never even thought that
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:44.280]  they would do that. But the other, the other, the other obvious way that they could go is
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.400]  the way that all the other pro products are, right? It's not the iPad three pro. It's not
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:55.840]  the iPad four pro. It's not the Mac book, probably 17 pro at this point. It's just Mac
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:03.840]  book pro iPad pro. They could just call it iPhone pro and iPhone pro max. Now, I don't
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:11.100]  think they will do that. And I almost think they can't do that in the abstract. That would
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:16.600]  be cleaner and it would be nicer and it would, it would be both. It's less of a mouthful.
[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:21.960]  It would look better. I think, you know, and these numbers are starting to get unwieldy.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:30.460]  They're big numbers and I think just calling it iPhone pro would be very elegant. And again,
[01:58:30.460 --> 01:58:34.960]  and it would be more in line with all of their other products where it's just category name
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:40.160]  than the word pro. So in the abstract that would be better. But in practice, the way
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:45.680]  they sell iPhones, I don't think it works. I think they'd need to keep numbering them
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:52.120]  and adding letters to distinguish which one is the newest because like when they come
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:58.880]  out with new iPad pros, they stop selling the old iPad pros. So after the new ones come
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:03.380]  out, you go in and say, I want an iPad pro. You're getting the new one and you don't need,
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:08.360]  they don't have the old ones at a lesser price point. The lesser price point is occupied
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:13.960]  by entirely different products. The iPad air that just playing iPad, the iPad mini with
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:20.600]  the iPhone, they continued to sell year old two year old three year old phones and they
[01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:27.480]  continue to manufacture them for years to come. And I think what some people don't realize
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:33.440]  and I didn't, I'm not even sure when I became fully aware of this, but for example, last
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:41.880]  year when the iPhone XS and XR debuted in September, they took the iPhone 10 from the
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:47.200]  year before out of the lineup of the ones that they put up on the slide behind Phil
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:54.280]  Schiller. They took them out of Apple stores, they took them off apple.com. So now on apple.com
[01:59:54.280 --> 02:00:02.920]  you can buy an iPhone XS, you can buy a XR or you can buy an iPhone eight, but they still
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:08.440]  make iPhone tens, regular iPhone tens. They still are in manufacturer and you can still
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:13.480]  buy them brand new, but they apple itself doesn't buy them. They're in the quote unquote
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:18.200]  channel. So you can go certain carriers, phone carriers around the world, still sell them
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:23.200]  brand new. Best Buy, for example, still sells them. You can go to best buy.com and buy a
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:29.260]  brand new iPhone 10 and that's not an iPhone 10 that has been sitting around for 11 months
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:36.000]  unsold. They still make them. They just don't sell them through for for clarity of product
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  line purposes. Apple itself minimizes it, but the channel has phones that even apple
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.640]  itself doesn't sell and there needs to be. I don't think it works. It would obviously
[02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:54.960]  work for the first year this year if they just called the brand new phones iPhone Pro
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.660]  because they're the only ones called iPhone Pro. But then come next year, if the replacements
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:05.920]  are still called iPhone Pro, now you've got a year old iPhone Pro being sold alongside
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:11.960]  a new iPhone Pro and there's no distinction. Yeah, and it doesn't work. That doesn't work.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:19.920]  Now in support documents like when you go to apple.com and you want to find out about,
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:27.480]  you know, getting technical support for your Mac book, they'll say Mac book pro in parentheses
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:33.400]  2015. And you can, you know, I guess you get the same thing when you go to the system profiler
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.240]  on your Mac to find out exactly what model you have. So they'll use the model year for
[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:43.800]  technical support purposes to specify exactly which model you have and tell you the details
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:50.120]  of other identifying details of what CPU it has, etc. But they're not going to sell phones
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:58.720]  like that. They're not going to put billboards up that say I iPhone Pro 2019. No, I and,
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:04.760]  you know, the way you explained it earlier is absolutely perfect. Because if you think
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:11.160]  of an iPad Pro, you have an iPad Pro. Oh, is it this year's? No, it's last year's. Yeah.
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:16.280]  Well, you know, then there's your eye, but it's still an iPad Pro. And I like that naming
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:25.120]  invention. Yeah. You know, Apple's naming has been very simple. And I, I'm a big fan
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:33.280]  of it. You know, I want to get an iPhone Max. Well, here's an iPhone Max. You know, do you
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:38.560]  need a specific year? No, I think you're going to a story. I want an iPhone Max. Love it.
[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:44.960]  Well, I think you need to continue that iPhone Pro Max. iPhone Pro Max. Although it's starting
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:52.800]  to sound like some kind of vitamin supplement, you know, say real fast in time. Somebody
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:58.520]  else suggested going back to plus, but plus, I thought full Schiller explained that, that
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:03.120]  they switched from plus to max, because it's only bigger. Somebody disputes that and says
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:08.440]  they rewatch that segment of the preview, you know, but when they had the plus phones,
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:12.960]  the plus phones were more than just bigger, they had better cameras, slightly better.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:16.900]  They were mostly the same, like the iPhone eight versus eight plus and the seven versus
[02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:24.240]  seven plus. They were mostly the same, but the cameras were always slightly better in
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:30.320]  the plus ones were like they had image stabilization before the smaller ones did. And then the
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.080]  next year, the smaller ones got image stabilization for still photos, but then the plus got image
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.320]  stabilization for video. You know, they were always a little step ahead. Whereas ever since
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:45.960]  last year with the iPhone XS and XS Max, they are literally spec for spec comparable, except
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:50.600]  that the max is bigger. It has a bigger display and because it's bigger, it also does have
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:56.160]  a bigger battery and does get a little bit of extra battery life. But in terms of camera
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:59.240]  performance, they are literally the exact same camera modules.
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:04.360]  Well, and let's not forget that last year they also did something that that blew my
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:09.040]  mind that I thought was one of the best things they had done in a long time. And that's include
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:18.160]  the same chip, the same processor in all three phones, which is what made the iPhone XR such
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:26.720]  an incredible value. Yes, it had the one camera, but my girlfriend's sister wrote, I don't
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:32.060]  know, maybe two weeks ago and said I know that there's probably a new iPhone coming
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:40.480]  out in in the fall, but mine is actually dead and I can't wait. So I need to buy one. What
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:46.520]  do you think of the iPhone Max? And I said, go buy it. Yeah, iPhone Max is because, you
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:52.120]  know, she's not a techie. She she likes to take pictures. Yeah. But she she just needs
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:57.600]  something that's going to last and something that's good value. So yeah, go buy the iPhone
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:04:59.560]  XR. It is not
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:05.240]  you said Max, you meant the oh, you meant the 10? Yeah, the the the tenor. Well, that's
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:10.640]  why that's and then I even said XR. Yeah, now you're you're thing is rubbing off on
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:17.000]  me here. I might need a beer soon. Well, that's why I like the idea of just calling the new
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.720]  the new 10 are just call that iPhone 11. And then call the other two at the higher price
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:30.860]  points with the extra cameras, the iPhone 11 pros. I like calling the the tenor replacement
[02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:36.920]  just playing iPhone 11 because I truly believe that's the that's the iPhone most people should
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:42.360]  buy. I really do. Yeah. You know, and part of that is the cost. You know, it's it's two
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:48.000]  hundred and fifty ish to more more dollars less, which is significant on a percentage
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.320]  basis. It's like 25 percent less. It's it's more than 25. It's like a third less compared
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:06:01.200]  to the max size. You get a big screen. It's a it is not OLED, but it is a great display.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:07.100]  This whole you know, and in some ways, I honestly feel that it's better than the OLED. I actually
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:14.240]  think that I know it doesn't have the the super high contrast ratio. So it doesn't show
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:19.360]  dark stuff as well. Like if you're watching a dark movie or something like that. But there's
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:25.800]  other things that I feel like an LCD screen is actually better and doesn't have you know,
[02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:29.860]  they have to do a lot of stuff to get that OLED to not have like a blue tint or something
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:35.040]  like that. I think it's a fantastic screen. I think the fact that it's two X retina instead
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:42.920]  of three X is a total non-issue because of the way OLED works at a sub pixel level. Three
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:49.320]  X isn't that much better than two X with the weird sub pixel layout of OLED compared to
[02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:56.240]  an LCD. It's a great display. And most people, typical people I know, never zoom on their
[02:06:56.240 --> 02:07:01.200]  camera. So having just that one camera lens, it's the one that they want to use anyway.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:06.480]  Like so Amy has the 10 S Max and she doesn't take any pictures at two X. She takes all
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:11.080]  of her pictures. She does take a lot of pictures. She takes them all at one X and I don't take
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:17.920]  any that is either. Yeah. And and supposedly the rumor is that this iPhone 11, the replacement
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:23.080]  for the 10 R is going to have the second camera anyway. Now it just won't have the third extra
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:29.040]  wide angle lens. I, I, I really think just calling it the iPhone 11 and saying this is
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:34.280]  the standard model for most people and the pro is if you want to spend more, I think
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:41.040]  that is perfect branding. And I think really, really any way to emphasize to somebody who's
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:47.280]  unsure because they'd see that these other ones are more expensive and their gut is telling
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.800]  them, I don't think I need anything. I don't care if it's stainless steel instead of aluminum.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:57.840]  I don't see any difference in the display. I don't care if the, uh, the black bezel around
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:05.600]  the edge to edge display is a millimeter or two bigger on this one than that one. Uh,
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:09.760]  I don't, I, you know, anybody with that gut feeling of, I just don't see why this phone
[02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:15.360]  is worth $300 more than this one. But in the back of my head, I'm worried that I'm buying
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:19.400]  the junior iPhone or something like that. Any kind of branding by just calling it the
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:24.600]  iPhone 11 to, to put those people at ease and say, yeah, this is the standard iPhone
[02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:29.560]  for most people. I think that's fantastic branding and really would give people confidence
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:33.740]  that, yeah, I feel like this is the phone I want and yeah, I'm going to get it. So it
[02:08:33.740 --> 02:08:38.880]  kind of feels like last year if you take last year's phone, okay, the, the iPhone XS is
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:45.360]  the standard model. Then we have the, uh, iPhone XS max, um, or the tennis. Why, why
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.480]  can't I, I don't know, Jim, I don't know. Okay. Better get a beer. I'm going to have
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:57.960]  to soon. I stupid. I drank a coffee before we started now, you know, um, the, the iPhone
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:05.380]  10 X, 10 S max. Oh, but then we have this other one that's lower. Yeah. And you're saying
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:10.080]  that that the way that, um, you're doing it would get rid of that. Like here, here is
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:14.840]  the standard edition. By the way, we have two that are higher. We don't have any that
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:19.860]  are lower than this. This is it. I agree. Standard, that'd be good. Standard and pro
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:25.000]  I think is the way to go in the same way with the Mac book lineup where the Mac book air
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.500]  isn't it's just sort of like that's the standard. I mean, that's when they reintroduce the Mac
[02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:34.140]  book air last October, that was really more or less the way they pitched it as this is
[02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:38.940]  the Mac book for most people. This is the most beloved Mac book we've ever made. It's
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:43.520]  the best selling model. It is the one that people, this is the shape and the form factor
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.200]  that people think of when they think of a Mac book. This is the Mac book air. You know,
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:54.640]  um, I really do think that using the word pro in that way to emphasize this is extra.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.560]  Yes, we love it. We support it. We, we stand behind the higher price point and some of
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.640]  our customers really want the extra features. They're going to love this extra wide angle
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:08.980]  lens. Uh, you know, they're not saying don't buy it, but they're saying this is, you know,
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:12.800]  this is the standard one. This is the deluxe one. And I think that's perfect branding.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.540]  So I really hope and think maybe this year I've got it right. iPhone 11 pro and just
[02:10:17.540 --> 02:10:25.280]  iPhone 11. I'm with you. Uh, what else do we got here? So this, the, the, the pro models
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  are, you know, everybody, this has leaked months and months ago, maybe even a year ago
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:33.240]  that they're going to switch to a, a big square thing on the back, which will have a third
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:37.440]  camera lens and maybe some other sensors for depth or something like that to fill in the
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:44.280]  square. Um, that's cool. I can't wait to see it. I feel like the fact that we know that
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:49.620]  that's coming with this extra wide angle lens doesn't tell us the story because I feel like
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:54.840]  there's the, it's, it's how it combines with the software and what the software is going
[02:10:54.840 --> 02:11:03.940]  to do. Like when you're shooting with the regular default lens, what is the iPhone going
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:09.180]  to do with that extra information from that wide angle lens at the same time? I feel like
[02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:15.540]  I, I just, I would be shocked if they're not using that to do something in that field of
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:20.620]  computational photography, uh, to make just even when you're not shooting at the wide
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:26.580]  angle that they're going to use the information from the wide angle lens to, um, to make that
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:30.840]  photo better in the same way that when you shoot portrait mode, you're using the two
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:37.300]  X lens, but they use information from the one X lens to help get that depth.
[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:44.740]  Well, and, and according to what Gurman said, they're going to use like three photos, right?
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:51.180]  And try and bring everything together. Right. And you know, that's, it's, I think a lot
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:56.180]  of what we expect from Apple in a few ways with the, with the technology for a machine
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:12:03.500]  learning and, and bringing in, you know, these extra cameras. I don't, I don't care about
[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:09.020]  the, how big the camera is on the back. Again, that's like a dirty credit card. Just don't
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:19.700]  care. Um, but I, I, I use a camera on my iPhone, very similar to how Amy uses hers. I mean,
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:28.500]  I take out my, my iPhone and I put it up and I snap a picture and that's it. I I'm basically
[02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:35.160]  done. The better tools that Apple gives me to be able to take that picture, the better
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:39.580]  my pictures are going to be. Right. Well, the more stuff that they do computationally
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.100]  automatically at the moment you press the shutter and that you don't have to go into
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:47.980]  edit mode. You don't have to do anything. It just, it just happens. The only thing I
[02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:54.880]  ever want to use edit mode for is to crop. Yeah. Well, you know, uh, other than that,
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:00.060]  I really don't need to do anything because Apple's pictures, the way that the cameras
[02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:04.700]  go right now, take a great picture. I can go and take a picture of a, you know, a bee
[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:10.820]  on a flower or something and it looks just gorgeous or sunset when I'm in Mexico or whatever
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:15.700]  it is. And they just look great. And that's the way that I think that that's what Apple
[02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:20.100]  needs to deliver to me. I understand that there are a lot of other things that I can
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:24.580]  do. I just don't want to have to do them. Yeah. There's an interesting tidbit in here
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:29.700]  too that, uh, that says that they're going to have quote significantly upgraded video
[02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:33.060]  recording capabilities, getting them closer to professional video cameras. And that's
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:38.180]  all it says. Um, other than that, you're going to be able to retouch and apply effects and,
[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:43.900]  and colors and reframe and crop video, uh, and stuff like that. But I also think I very
[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:49.220]  strongly suspect that, that, that with this a 13 system on a chip, you know, cause that's
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:52.500]  the number they're up to. So big, you know, no secret there that they're going to call
[02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:58.380]  it the a 13, but those chips are getting so much faster, especially not just the CPU's,
[02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:04.180]  but like the GPU capabilities that they need for this on the fly stuff. Like one of the
[02:14:04.180 --> 02:14:11.540]  most amazing things about last year's cameras was that when you're shooting, uh, at like
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:16.540]  30 frames per second, the camera, you know, video, the camera is still taking 60 frames
[02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:22.220]  per second and using the, every other frame that they're not even using, you know, they're
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:26.420]  still writing 30 frames to this, but they're using, they're shooting 60 and using the other
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:32.100]  frames to like reduce the noise in the, and they're all live, not like, Oh, you shoot
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:37.700]  the video. And then in the background, you know, the iPhone processes, it's all live.
[02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:44.020]  You hit the, hit the shutter, shoot your video. It's doing it every single frame. Uh, I can't
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:48.620]  help but think that they are definitely going to do stuff along those lines, using the extra
[02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:54.560]  lens on the camera to get more information, you know, that there'll be shooting 120 frames
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.540]  per second. They'll shoot 60 with the one lens and 60 with the other and combine the
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:04.500]  data to get, um, to get, you know, better low light capabilities for video and stuff
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:08.500]  like that. I mean, cause that's one thing that you can really tell with the iPhone is
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:13.460]  like when you're in like a restaurant or someplace dark and, and it's like, I wonder if I can
[02:15:13.460 --> 02:15:17.020]  get a picture here and you, you turn on your iPhone camera and you're shooting a still
[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.220]  and say, yeah, I can totally get a picture. This is amazing. But if you switched a video,
[02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:25.020]  it like goes black and it's like, you can hardly see anything. So getting video to get
[02:15:25.020 --> 02:15:31.000]  low light is really tough optically, but I feel like they can, the way they're going
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.900]  to get there is computationally low light has been my thing for, for many years, being
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:41.620]  able to get good low light pictures at concerts. Yeah, totally. You know, and, and, and to
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:49.240]  be able to, um, you know, take down the, or I don't know, uh, process the lights coming
[02:15:49.240 --> 02:15:54.540]  from the stage so that you can actually get a decent picture with all that foreground
[02:15:54.540 --> 02:16:00.260]  being so black and having those stage lights be so bright. Yeah. Right. So, you know, that's
[02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:05.820]  a, that's a real, a real problem. And you know, I don't blame Apple that, you know,
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:11.940]  you can't always get a great shot from that because damn, that's gotta be one of the toughest
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:16.620]  pictures to try and take. Anyway, I don't think I, this is the easiest prediction in
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:22.740]  the world to make, but I would, I strongly suspect that the camera section of the September
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:28.820]  Apple event is going to be in a huge chunk of the iPhone event, I would think, uh, just
[02:16:28.820 --> 02:16:33.460]  like it has been the last few years. And if anything growing bigger and bigger, I mean,
[02:16:33.460 --> 02:16:36.100]  if you, they're never going to change the name of the product, it's going to be the
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:40.380]  iPhone until they stop making the damn things. But if you think about what it is, if you're
[02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:45.900]  going to name one thing that of all the hundreds of things an iPhone can do, the better name
[02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:50.220]  for it at this point would be the eye camera. The camera, you know, people use the camera
[02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:53.980]  way more than they talk on the fricking phone. Oh yeah. Or at least they're happier to do
[02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:58.700]  it. Uh, what else is here? So one of the cool features, uh, again, a lot of this isn't original
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:02.300]  to Garmin. I've seen all this stuff floating around, but he's, you know, assembled it all
[02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:08.900]  in one place is a wireless charging for the wireless charging AirPods. So in other words,
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:13.060]  you could put your iPhone down and then put your AirPod, if you have the wireless charging
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:18.420]  AirPod case, put it on the back and it'll charge. That's a cool feature. Samsung has
[02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:24.500]  something like that where it'll actually charge other phones. Uh, so, you know, uh, I'll point
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:29.900]  that out before somebody else points it out that Samsung has something like that. Yes.
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:33.100]  But just charging the AirPods alone would be pretty cool and it shouldn't take much
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:37.260]  power. It shouldn't really deplete your phone much because the AirPods seemed to charge,
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:41.820]  you know, you know, don't really take much of a charge to get, to get powered up. Yeah.
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:47.100]  And it shouldn't take, I mean, it's not going to be as fast as plugging it into a charger,
[02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:52.820]  but it should be good enough to get a charger. Like if you're out and about and you get that
[02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:58.740]  sad little bloop bloop, you know? Uh, yeah. And, and you got like five minutes ago on
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:05.620]  a podcast and it's like, oh no, uh, more shatter resistant, supposedly. I don't know what the
[02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:08.920]  deal is with that, but I guess some kind of upgrade to the glass. Here's the, here's the
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:14.460]  thing that I'm excited about is it says some, at least some of the colors. So he obviously
[02:18:14.460 --> 02:18:18.020]  doesn't know if it's all of them or whatever, but that some of them are going to have a
[02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:23.420]  matte finish on the back as opposed to the existing glossy finish. I would love that.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:29.020]  I would love that. My least favorite thing about the iPhone 10 and 10 S two years into
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:36.340]  this is that they feel the same on both sides. Yeah. And I have long been somebody who carries
[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:44.260]  my iPhones naked without a case. I've used a case this year more with the iPhone 10 S
[02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:50.700]  than I have with all other iPhones combined. I still don't use the case. I don't have one
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:55.660]  on now. I've taken it off, but while like vacationing and like, uh, uh, like I said,
[02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:59.620]  going to theme parks and stuff like that, uh, with my hands sweaty in the Florida heat
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:04.940]  and stuff like that. Uh, and just wanting, you know, and with shorts, you know, they,
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:09.620]  you know, shorts have floppier pockets than jeans, you know, and jeans. I always carry,
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:14.620]  you know, for obvious reasons, I carry it with the screen pointing in at my thigh, you
[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:18.380]  know, for protection sake. Like if something does hit my phone, I'd rather have the back
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:24.620]  crack than the front crack. Um, so I just can take a guess, but you know, there are
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:28.300]  just times when it's on the table or whatever and you pick it up and you don't quite sure.
[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:31.620]  And I have the black one of course, cause you know, that's what I always buy. So you
[02:19:31.620 --> 02:19:36.500]  can't really tell, you know, it would be nice if there was no way to be confused which side
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:42.820]  was up and the camera bump alone isn't, isn't really enough. So a matte finish both to distinguish
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:49.460]  by feel which side is which and uh, just to make it less slippery would be a very welcome
[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:55.460]  change to me. I just think the matte finish is kind of cool. Yeah. Yeah. To be honest,
[02:19:55.460 --> 02:20:00.660]  you know, on top of all of the stuff that you mentioned, I just think it's kind of cool.
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:04.740]  Uh, yeah, I'm curious to see what they come up with. If, if of all the iPhones I've ever
[02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:09.660]  bought and I've bought one every year, the only one I regret that I feel like I bought
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:18.720]  the wrong color was the, the jet black iPhone seven and I always buy black when I'm offered.
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:25.300]  So it's the, the decision matrix has always been very simple. Get the black one except
[02:20:25.300 --> 02:20:29.820]  with the iPhone seven. There were two, there was jet black and matte black. And so for
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:34.700]  the first time ever, I had to make a decision and I went jet black because I guess I thought
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:38.340]  it looked cooler, but that jet black one, even though it wasn't class, it was aluminum,
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:42.580]  sort of had the problems that, um, it wasn't slippery in my opinion, but it still was hard
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:47.100]  to sort of tell by feel. And in hindsight, I really kind of wish I got the matte one.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:54.340]  I think the matte is, was a cooler. I got to, I was too enamored with the, uh, the shininess
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:59.100]  like a Crow. Whereas I think it fits. I think matte finished fits my style better. I will
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:04.860]  say this, I've, I've long been someone who carries my iPhone naked without a case. Uh,
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:08.580]  I just liked the way it feels better. I liked that it's as thin as possible. I like being
[02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:14.100]  able to touch the buttons directly, but I've used a case with my iPhone 10 S this year,
[02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:20.220]  more than I've used a case with all other iPhones combined. And it's specifically for
[02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:26.980]  the combination of grippiness and feel. The only time I've ever used a case, um, with
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:34.060]  an iPhone is when they, these were older iPhones, uh, when battery was more of an issue than
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:39.420]  it is now. And I had one of those, um, battery charging cases. Yeah, I gotcha. Yeah, I hear
[02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:44.740]  you. That's the only time that I ever had a case. And that was more out of necessity
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:53.040]  than anything else. You know, they would almost get through the day, but not quite. I just,
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:59.740]  you know, for me, the battery case was just a no brainer. Uh, one thing I sometimes forget
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:05.920]  is I forget it or not that I forget, but it just doesn't occur to me as I forget that
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:11.780]  you can manually put your phone into low power mode, I E yellow battery mode, you know, it,
[02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:18.220]  it automatically kicks in when you get to 20%. But that mode really works. A couple
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:23.040]  of weeks ago, I was somewhere where I had to wait for a very long time, uh, like a doctor's
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:29.940]  office type situation. Um, and you know, typical big office building where you don't get good
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:36.060]  cell reception inside and I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I was like first thing of
[02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:41.660]  the day. So I started with, you know, near 100% on the iPhone and it wasn't too long.
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:46.980]  And I noticed I was already down to 80% or 78% or something like that. And the phone
[02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:51.460]  felt really warm, you know, which is a bad sign in terms of battery life. And I knew
[02:22:51.460 --> 02:22:56.980]  I had a lot longer to wait and didn't bring a charger, didn't bring a battery pack. And
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:23:00.700]  I thought, oh, I'll put it in low power mode, put it in low power mode, went right back
[02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:06.060]  to wasting all of my time on Twitter and doing all of the exact, all of the exact same things
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:12.620]  that had just used up 20% of my battery, you know, in a snap of a finger. And I used it
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:18.540]  and used it and used it and it was still at like, uh, you know, 74% like it, the difference
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:22.300]  is dramatic. I don't know how much stuff it turns off or whatever, but like actually using
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:26.420]  it, you don't really seem to notice it. Like I, I, I know that there are people out there
[02:23:26.420 --> 02:23:29.980]  who just keep their phone in low power mode all day. Like they just keep it on like from
[02:23:29.980 --> 02:23:34.180]  the start of the day. Um, so there's my tip of the day is don't forget about low power
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:37.720]  mode. Don't, don't wait till it gets to 20%. If you're ever in a situation where you feel
[02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:42.360]  like your battery's draining too fast, put it in low power mode. It really, really does
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:46.860]  save it. And the other thing I noticed that day waiting is that my phone cooled off too.
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:54.740]  Even though I didn't stop using it, something happens. Low power mode tip of the day. Yeah.
[02:23:54.740 --> 02:24:02.300]  What else is on German's rumor list? Uh, Mac pros. Yeah. He doesn't know anything about
[02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:06.220]  them though. I mean, uh, we know they're coming. I mean, and they've already announced it.
[02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:11.340]  I mean, the only, the only thing really left to wonder about with the Mac pros is a, when
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:16.540]  is it going to ship? B, what are the higher end configs going to cost? All they've told
[02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:21.660]  us is the starting point. And then a big one to me is, are they going to come out with
[02:24:21.660 --> 02:24:27.140]  an Apple branded reasonably priced display and which I guess, no, I guess, you know,
[02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:32.460]  now that LG has updated their 5k display, that's probably Apple's answer for people
[02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:38.860]  who just want a quote unquote normal normal display that comes with the stand. But I would,
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:43.020]  it would make my day and I know it would make an awful lot of people happy if in addition
[02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:49.780]  to the $6,000, $7,000 pro display XDR, if they just came out with a plain old pro display
[02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:57.220]  that just had that iMac panel in a display that looks like the pro display. Yeah. Um,
[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:03.580]  iPad, uh, they say there's new ones coming out. It doesn't really have a lot of details.
[02:25:03.580 --> 02:25:09.500]  No. And same with Apple watch AirPods and, and HomePod. Although HomePod seems weird
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:14.380]  though. Well, that's interesting. Why do you, why do you think it's weird? Well, that they
[02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:25.180]  would drop it to two tweeters, um, down from seven in the current HomePod. Well, a, I wonder
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:32.700]  if that, if that's true, is it a replacement HomePod or is it a new lower priced HomePod?
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:38.060]  Yeah, I think so. Right. They keep, like it would make a lot of sense to me to go from
[02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:43.020]  six tweeters, six tweeters or seven tweeters, seven, seven. It would be, make a lot of sense
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:52.100]  if they, if they come out with a HomePod with only two, if that's $129 or $149 HomePod or
[02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:56.380]  even better, you know, $99 HomePod. That'd be great. You know, the lower the price they
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:26:01.420]  can get it to get more people to get one. And if it still sounds really good for what
[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:07.460]  it is, that'd be great. But I can't see how, no matter how good their audio engineers are,
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:13.480]  I cannot see how a two tweeter HomePod could sound as good as, as the seven. There's no
[02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:19.060]  way that it can. I don't think that, that a two tweeter home, now there is a lot of
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:25.760]  things that these guys can do in software to make, um, make the, the speakers and make
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:31.700]  everything sound good. Right. Uh, you know, between tweeters and woofers and speakers
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:36.140]  and the drivers and everything else, there's a lot they can do to make these sound good.
[02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:41.100]  So I'm not saying that they won't sound good. I just, they're not going to sound as good.
[02:26:41.100 --> 02:26:48.380]  Um, I love my HomePod. I use my HomePod all the time just because it sounds so damn good.
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:53.420]  You know? Uh, and I, do you have it? Do you have it paired with another one? I wish I
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:58.180]  did. I wish I get, I should get another one. I would love to have them paired. I know that
[02:26:58.180 --> 02:27:03.680]  it's a lot of money to get to, um, but we've got two in the kitchen and the, it is more
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:10.220]  than twice as good. It is, it is truly remarkable. And I know that the, the, the, the financial
[02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:15.500]  outlay to get to is a pretty significant thing. That's not like if you're doing it like we
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:18.860]  are in the kitchen, it's not like your home entertainment system. And all of a sudden
[02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:24.380]  you're spending five or 600 bucks to get two of these things. But it really does sound
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:32.460]  more than twice as good. It is truly a rather remarkable and it really, really, I don't
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:38.620]  have the best years, uh, for stuff like that, but it really hides the source. It just feels
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:42.500]  like the room is full of music, you know, and it doesn't, it doesn't feel like they're
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:47.780]  coming from two spots. It's just full of music. It's anyway, Marco and I, a couple of weeks
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:54.780]  ago on this show, we're speculating and wondering, you know, is HomePod something that Apple
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:59.420]  might even drop, you know, the way they got out of the wifi router business with airports,
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:04.300]  uh, just because it maybe hasn't taken off and they want to concentrate on what to hit.
[02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:06.980]  The fact that there's even, you know, the Gurman is saying that they're working on a
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:12.340]  new one, uh, would certainly alleviate that worry. And I really hope they don't cause
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:17.060]  I love the product. I really think it's great. I think the potential is there. Obviously,
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:22.140]  you know, they need to keep banging on Siri to make Siri better and better, but the audio
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:29.140]  quality of the HomePod is, is really exceptional. Yeah. And it's just so hard to convey the
[02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:33.940]  only way you can, you know, the only way you can tell is to listen to it, you know? Yep.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:41.480]  And the HomePod is, when you're talking about, should they, or will they at some point drop
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:47.580]  the HomePod? I think a lot of that depends on where they see the hub, you know, was the
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:53.580]  hub, something like the, the Apple TV, or is the hub going to be Siri and the HomePod
[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:59.060]  and the way that HomePod talks to the house. And, you know, I, to me, that's where a lot
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:06.060]  of this is, is going to end up coming from. I, for, for sound, the HomePod is absolutely
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:12.460]  brilliant. And the fact that, you know, you can talk to it and give Siri a very simple
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:18.100]  commands to control your music and to, you know, skip songs or raise or lower the volume
[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:25.060]  or to play something is, is great. You know, I was doing some work around the house on
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:31.740]  the weekend and just said, you know, Siri, play some classic rock and, you know, put
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:38.540]  the volume up by 10%. Perfect. Love it. Hey, let's take a break and I'll thank our third

[02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:43.280]  it all right there in the website. You don't need to know a lick of code. You don't need
[02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.900]  to know the difference between H even if you don't know the difference in HTML and CSS
[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:52.300]  Squarespace makes it so you don't have to worry about it. If you do, if you do know
[02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:56.540]  what HTML and CSS and JavaScript are and you know how to use them, you can get in there
[02:30:56.540 --> 02:31:00.660]  and work with the code if you want to. It's like having a car. You can open the hood.
[02:31:00.660 --> 02:31:04.500]  You can get in there. But really, if you just want to turn the ignition and drive, you can
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:10.940]  do that. You never have to open the hood of the car. It's that simple, that easy to use.

[02:32:10.420 --> 02:32:14.660]  it for the Garmin report, right? That's it for the major stuff. Uh, if I was going to
[02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:21.260]  get a free domain name, I think I'd take daring fireball. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it might be taken.
[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:27.020]  Uh, last thing I have here, I got a couple of questions from listener Mike Fleagle. I
[02:32:27.020 --> 02:32:33.060]  didn't ask for a q and a episode, but he gave me one unsolicited, uh, speculating. I mean,
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:38.060]  we're getting close. I suspect you think at the September event now we know that we're
[02:32:38.060 --> 02:32:42.260]  going to get iphones. I mean, that's just a given, right? And we're probably going to
[02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:46.420]  get the new apple watch because I believe in the last ever since apple watch has gotten
[02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:53.860]  on a fall schedule, the watches come out at the phone event. Uh, so I would be very surprised.
[02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:59.660]  Uh, I would be surprised if there were not new apple watches. Uh, and if there are new
[02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:05.580]  apple watches, which I expect, I would expect them to debut at this September event. Um,
[02:33:05.580 --> 02:33:13.080]  do you think they will use the September event to unveil the rest of their services initiative?
[02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:20.100]  In other words, tell us, tell us what, uh, apple arcade is going to cost. Tell us what,
[02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:25.820]  uh, these various things that they have told us about at that services event a couple of
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:31.580]  months ago, but didn't tell us what they're going to cost. Here's what I expect in September
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:39.020]  iphone for, for hardware. Uh, anything else, including watch, even though it makes perfect
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:46.660]  and everything else for hardware for me is, um, extra that's, that's just gravy, hardware,
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:55.380]  um, watch home pod, air pods, Mac. So the only thing that I really expect is phone and
[02:33:55.380 --> 02:34:02.780]  that's an obvious one. The other thing that I expect besides iOS, macOS, you know, the
[02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:08.140]  final versions they're going to announce when they're going to be available, um, is all
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:15.700]  of the information, including pricing and availability of all of their services. I'm,
[02:34:15.700 --> 02:34:23.500]  they have so many services. I think I'm forgetting one. So there's a apple arcade, rumor, rumor,
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:29.740]  rumor, uh, broken by a hacker extraordinaire gee, gee Rambo writes at nine to five Mac.
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:36.260]  Somehow he apple employees are testing, uh, the arcade service and somehow it's one of
[02:34:36.260 --> 02:34:43.740]  them, uh, uh, gave him pre-release access and then he started poking at the API's and
[02:34:43.740 --> 02:34:49.100]  uh, figured from one of the API's that at least at the moment apple was planning to
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:55.020]  charge four 99 a month for apple arcade. That sounds right to me. A lot of people were expecting
[02:34:55.020 --> 02:35:02.060]  nine 99, uh, four 99 is, and again, you know, never be surprised when apple charges more
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:09.420]  than you were hoping for for a problem, right? Yeah. But, uh, I'll be honest, a four 99 sounds
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:19.980]  right to me. Well, because these services are a, a quantity game, right? Like, and again,
[02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:25.400]  apple doesn't play by other companies rules. So Netflix of course is all in Hulu, you know,
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:30.640]  are always trying to get more people to sign up. And yes, Netflix has raised their rate,
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.980]  you know, a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there. You know, over the years,
[02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:39.940]  the cost of a regular standard Netflix subscription has gone up, but for the most part, they're
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:48.040]  primarily concerned not on charging a huge premium for one family to have a Netflix subscription,
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:51.900]  but to get as many people as possible signed up. They're really going for that. And I just
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:58.820]  think that's just the way that's the services thing works. So four 99 for apple arcade feels,
[02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:05.940]  uh, like, I feel like it's either going to be four 99 or nine 99 and four 99 to me is
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:11.140]  going to get people to cheer and there'll be like, Ooh, and then, you know, and there'll
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:18.220]  be like, I'll definitely sign it up. If I was making a bet, I'd go for four 99. Yeah.
[02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:22.420]  And I really, and when that leaked, I wrote and I, I, I really think, especially at four
[02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:27.060]  99 that, that in addition to just being a popular service that I think an awful lot
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:32.900]  of people will sign up for because boy, oh boy, an awful lot of people play games on,
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:38.380]  especially on iOS devices. Um, you know, and, and if, and if this helps gaming on the Mac
[02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:44.100]  and apple TV, that's, as you just said, that's gravy in my opinion, if it, if it, if it makes
[02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:49.660]  gaming and puts more popular games on the Mac and if it can somehow reinvigorate gaming
[02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:55.700]  on apple TV, which really seems like a wasted opportunity given how powerful the apple TV
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:37:02.940]  and especially the apple TV four K are for a casual to, you know, it's, they're obviously
[02:37:02.940 --> 02:37:08.780]  not, you know, gaming PCs, but they're really pretty powerful, you know, compared to something,
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:14.060]  you know, even more compared to something successful like the Nintendo switch. Um, and
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:18.620]  it just, you know, hasn't taken off in my opinion because they don't ship with a controller
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:27.100]  and because, um, they insist on up to this point that games be playable without a controller
[02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:31.820]  and there's just certain types of games where you just cannot use the stupid remote control
[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:36.940]  that comes with apple TV to play the game. You just, this is not enough. Um, if they
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:42.900]  could get on top of that and turn apple TV into a switch like platform for games, that's
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:47.780]  just gravy. But obviously the, the, the bread and butter of apple arcade is the iOS, it's
[02:37:47.780 --> 02:37:51.620]  iPad and iPhone and people already spend a four, you know, they already make a lot of
[02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:59.540]  money on that to get in there. Did 30% or 15% on the recurring stuff. Um, I think that
[02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:04.980]  at four 99 and with, they can get an awful, a lot of exclusive games. Cause my understanding
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:09.420]  of the way arcade works is going to work is that the games in apple arcade are going to
[02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:15.380]  be exclusive to arcade, right? So it's not like this is a way to get some of your favorite
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:20.540]  games from the app store that you normally would have to buy or do free to play. They're
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:29.180]  lining up developers to create games exclusive to apple arcade that you won't be able to
[02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:35.160]  get just by just by pay. Yeah, you won't be able to get them on android. Uh, you won't
[02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:41.100]  be able to get them on other platforms and you won't be able to just buy it for $5 one
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:46.860]  time in the app store. It's, it's you, you subscribe to arcade to get these games. I
[02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:52.820]  think that not only do I think it could be very popular and from what I've been told
[02:38:52.820 --> 02:39:03.340]  from some people in the know, they are, this is an a team effort at apple's part to get
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:11.380]  top game developers, uh, on board and that there there's and, and no expense spared that
[02:39:11.380 --> 02:39:16.860]  they are when they say that they're putting money, giving money to developers, not giving,
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:20.940]  but you know, that the deals they're working out involved developing, they're supporting
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:29.140]  developers with large budgets to make these games or to finish these games and to do things
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:35.600]  that are expensive. Like, um, uh, I forget how many language, I mean, I don't think this
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:41.500]  is officially known, but it like all the games in arcade are going to have, uh, I don't know,
[02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:46.780]  a dozen languages supported around the world, including right to left languages left to
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:51.780]  right. That stuff costs a lot of money and some games, you know, it's more than just
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:56.540]  the start screen where there's, you know, you know, well translate the word start and
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:59.740]  high score and stuff like that. You know, there's a lot of games where there's, you
[02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:05.460]  know, it even like character acting, right? You're going to have to hire 12 sets of actors
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:10.580]  to do the voices or something like that. Uh, they're, they're really pumping, but they
[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:15.460]  want it done. Yeah, they want it done. Right. This is, and I really think not only could
[02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:21.500]  it be popular, but I think it could really disrupt the iOS gaming industry, which right
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:28.900]  now financially is dominated by what I call pay to win games like candy crush. And I know
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:32.780]  that the, you know, it's pay to play or something like that is the official term, but I call
[02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:37.580]  them pay to win. I sorta, I think I stole it from Ben Thompson, but the gist is games
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:43.700]  with in app purchases where it doesn't matter if you're even good at the game, you're going
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:49.340]  to have to pay a couple of bucks every, at least every couple of days to keep going to,
[02:40:49.340 --> 02:40:54.580]  to, to, to be competitive. And there's, you know, there's the battle games that are like
[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:58.220]  that. There's the candy crush type games, there's all sorts of games. And I know that
[02:40:58.220 --> 02:41:03.860]  they've de-emphasized the top grossing stuff in the app store and they just have top free
[02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:08.620]  and that, you know, and they sort of an edit more of an editorial, you know, like here's
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:12.940]  what we at the app store think, you know, are, are some of the best new games. But if
[02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:17.140]  they had the top grossing, the top one, and then when they last did, they're all dominated
[02:41:17.140 --> 02:41:24.640]  by these free or pay to win games, which in my opinion is, is another ethically sketchy
[02:41:24.640 --> 02:41:28.620]  area where there's sort of a casino mindset. You know, they're, they're really not that
[02:41:28.620 --> 02:41:32.340]  different psychologically from like a slot machine where they're, they're designed to
[02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:38.180]  keep you going and designed to keep, you know, designed to keep you pumping $3 here, $4 there
[02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:44.600]  for a bag of gems or whatever the, whatever the hell you're buying. The fact that Apple
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:48.780]  arcade is going to have none of that, that that's all forbidden, that they, you just,
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:52.980]  you pay five bucks a month, hopefully or 10 bucks a month, whatever the cost is, and you
[02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:58.860]  get the whole game, all of the game. And you know, if extra levels come out for, you know,
[02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:04.540]  new levels or new worlds or whatever the game has four months from now, you just get them.
[02:42:04.540 --> 02:42:10.300]  That could really, really change the behavior of people and what they pay. Because if you're
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:16.300]  already paying 20 bucks a month, 30 bucks a month on in-app purchases for the games
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:21.020]  you do play and you could switch to paying five bucks a month and never even have the
[02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:25.860]  nagging guilt in your head, like, ah, I'm kind of pissing away money on this, you know,
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:29.740]  and the games occupy or there's plenty of games to choose from and it occupies all of
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:33.900]  the free time that you want to be playing games on your devices. Well, why would you
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:39.500]  ever pay the play to the play to win games again? Yeah, I agree. I really think these
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:45.220]  could change things really significant. These games are supposed to be like, these are top
[02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:52.340]  notch graphics, top notch working, you know, taking care of or taking advantage of all
[02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:58.260]  the technologies and the processor and everything else. You can't get any better than what these
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:03.740]  games are. So what else is coming? There's of course, Apple TV Plus, which is where their
[02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:14.100]  original content, which is the biggest question mark, right? Because Netflix is the king of
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:20.940]  the mountain. Hulu is fairly well established. HBO is coming out with their thing. I forget
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:29.340]  what it's called, but you can also pay to get regular HBO without having a cable subscription
[02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:33.940]  and you get all of the movies that HBO has and all of the HBO shows that have ever come
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:37.540]  out. You know, you can go all the way back to the Sopranos and watch all the Sopranos.
[02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:42.420]  They've got these big, big libraries. And of course, the big one that's coming out soon
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:49.900]  is Disney Plus, which is also coming out with, you know, apparently a huge library of content
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:57.800]  because Disney has this giant archive of family movies and TV shows, etc. And Apple TV Plus
[02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:06.700]  is coming with like 10 shows. It's not a mountainous library of content. It is, you know, a very
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:13.140]  hand selected, uh, you know, and as the years go on five, 10 years from now, you know, like,
[02:44:13.140 --> 02:44:16.820]  so like the, the one I'm, I'm really looking forward to this one called the morning show
[02:44:16.820 --> 02:44:23.140]  with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Ritherspoon because I just love, uh, shows about shows.
[02:44:23.140 --> 02:44:27.220]  One of my all time favorite shows of all time is the Larry Sanders show, you know, the show
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:33.300]  about a talk show. So I just love the idea of a show about a show. I think there's, there's
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:38.100]  just something about that that to me makes for good television. I love the cast. I love
[02:44:38.100 --> 02:44:44.900]  Jennifer Aniston. I love Reese Ritherspoon. Steve Carell is a terrific actor. Um, and
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:49.060]  I saw the trailer, it looks great. I'm really looking forward to that. So 10 years from
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:52.740]  now, you know, you'll still be able to watch, you know, like when the morning show, let's
[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:56.940]  say it's a hit and they have three or four great seasons of the morning show and everybody
[02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:04.060]  says, wow, Apple really knocked it out of the park. Um, you know, there's the, uh, uh,
[02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:08.940]  what's the space show called? The one about the fictional, oh, something about mankind.
[02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:14.260]  Yeah. For all mankind, for all mankind. Uh, which again, looks like a fantastic show.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:19.220]  That's the one that's previewed a couple months ago, I think at WWDC. Yeah, it was at WWDC
[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:24.120]  and it's about a hypothetical world where the Russians had beaten us to the moon and
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:30.300]  had kept going. And the U S and Russia spent this instead of sort of backing away from
[02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:35.020]  the space race in the seventies, had spent the seventies and eighties continuing at the
[02:45:35.020 --> 02:45:40.780]  same extraordinary clip that they did in the sixties, right? I mean, we, in one decade
[02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:45.180]  we went from never having put a man into orbit to putting a fricking men on the moon. Like
[02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:49.660]  a, you know, so the whole premise of the show is what if we'd kept up that pace? A fantastic
[02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:54.500]  idea for a what if show 10 years from now, all those shows will be in the Apple TV plus
[02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:59.380]  library. You could go back and watch them if you never did. But at the get go in fall
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:03.980]  of 2019 all they've got are the new shows they have. How much can you charge for that?
[02:46:03.980 --> 02:46:09.980]  If if Netflix is 10 bucks and you get a thousand shows and if Disney plus is seven 99 and you
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:15.660]  get 10,000 Disney movies, how the hell can they charge 10 bucks a month for 10 shows?
[02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:23.980]  I don't think that they can right now, but we, we know that there are probably what about
[02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:32.580]  15 shows in production somewhere along the lines of, you know, being made or finished,
[02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:36.240]  but still that's not a lot of shows. Now we have to also consider, yeah, they're going
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:43.220]  to come out with, with those 15 shows over the next few months, but they're still continuing.
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:47.820]  I mean, in the time that we knew that there was 15 shows in the last couple of months,
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:53.980]  they probably have another 10 that they've added to that list that we don't know about.
[02:46:53.980 --> 02:46:58.660]  So there's continuous shows, but still that those numbers don't add up to a thousand.
[02:46:58.660 --> 02:47:05.220]  So you know, you, I think you have to price it accordingly, but you know, the, the worry
[02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:11.380]  there for them I think is that they put a price on it and it's too low. Then how do
[02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:18.500]  you raise the price later? You know, that's, that's gotta be a concern. Or do you try and
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:26.780]  come out with a fair price is $5 like a gaming arcade. Is that something that is okay. You
[02:47:26.780 --> 02:47:33.780]  know, so five bucks for that, you know, they're charging what, $9.99 for Apple music or 15
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:40.740]  for a family. So, you know, it doesn't seem, and there's millions of songs and you can
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:46.260]  basically play anything in the world you want. Well, you know, you can't do that with, with
[02:47:46.260 --> 02:47:48.700]  Apple TV plus.
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:53.500]  So one of my, what ifs ever since they announced that are getting into original TV content.
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:57.440]  And again, it doesn't really fit with the idea that Apple is in the services business
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:02.100]  to make money, which they keep reiterating over and over. They are, and you know, they,
[02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:06.700]  they have the financial results to prove it, you know, where as they report quarterly results,
[02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:13.580]  the services segment keeps going up. You know, they're in it for money. But I, in the back
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:19.060]  of my mind, I've, I just can't help but think that one of the things that has to be an idea
[02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:24.780]  is what if, what if you get Apple TV plus with Apple music, like Apple music is the
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:29.800]  one that makes sense to bundle that you would just, if you have Apple music, you get Apple
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:36.660]  TV plus. And I know that their original content to date has been sort of baby steps. You know,
[02:48:36.660 --> 02:48:42.740]  that they have the carrot carpool karaoke and they had that a goofy show where you were
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:52.700]  pitching apps to a goofy show, you know, tell, tell, tell Gwyneth Paltrow and Gary Vayner
[02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:57.780]  check what your app idea is. You know, that didn't really set the world on fire. But those
[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:01.700]  shows I thought that I don't, I think that those things they gave away with Apple music
[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:05.680]  now that's very different than the billion or $6 billion that they're supposedly spending
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:12.620]  on original content now. But if they bundled it with Apple music, it's not like they're
[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:17.660]  giving it away free. You're still paying 10 or 15 bucks a month, you know, and it's, you
[02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:22.580]  know, it would on day one, there's already millions and millions of people who already
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:27.900]  have Apple music. So they'd already have a huge audience that could start watching these
[02:49:27.900 --> 02:49:32.820]  shows and start telling people, Hey, this morning show is fantastic. It's a great show.
[02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:37.660]  You should get Apple music and watch this show. I don't know. I don't expect that new
[02:49:37.660 --> 02:49:41.620]  income though. Yeah, I don't. Well, it does. It is new income if they get more people to
[02:49:41.620 --> 02:49:45.900]  sign up for Apple music. Right. But with millions and millions of people, what if, what if they
[02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:54.900]  charged, you know, $4 or $5 for, or you get a discount if you're Apple music, I don't
[02:49:54.900 --> 02:50:03.420]  know. I love the idea of including it. But when you look at how many new people is that
[02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:07.940]  going to bring over to Apple music? And is that going to be enough of a bump? Don't forget
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:15.300]  what what Tim said in the last earnings either about services where, you know, in the next
[02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:21.780]  couple of years, they expect huge growth in services. Yeah. Financial and money wise,
[02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:27.980]  they expect huge growth in services. So I mean, they've obviously got something that
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:34.740]  they're eyeing that is going to, to generate that kind of billions of dollars. I really
[02:50:34.740 --> 02:50:40.420]  expect them to answer this at the September event because I, I think the September event,
[02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:45.260]  if I had to rank them by importance, I would say the September iPhone event is the most
[02:50:45.260 --> 02:50:50.340]  important, most watched, most paid attention to Apple event of the year, just because of
[02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:57.700]  the iPhone. WWDC is number two. And then number three is the fall October event that they
[02:50:57.700 --> 02:51:01.660]  sometimes don't even have because they don't have anything to announce. Although I think
[02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:05.500]  they're getting a little bit more regular about that. And I definitely expected this
[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:10.980]  year with these rumors of a new 16 inch MacBook Pro. And I certainly expect that's when new
[02:51:10.980 --> 02:51:16.180]  iPad pros and iPads would come out. They're not going to put the iPads. I don't think
[02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:19.100]  they would ever put the iPads in the same event as the iPhone because they just don't
[02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:24.820]  want to distract. Whereas to me, the watch doesn't distract from iPhone. No, no, you
[02:51:24.820 --> 02:51:31.420]  know. And so this is their premiere event. They are dead serious about this original
[02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:35.620]  content and the Apple arcade. So I really think that that's when they're going to announce
[02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:42.420]  it. The other thing along the lines of my, wouldn't it be nice idea if they just bundled
[02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:47.420]  it with the Apple music for no extra money, which I agree is unlikely because it's, you
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:55.500]  know, they want the money. But I just really, I don't feel like they have to, but I really
[02:51:55.500 --> 02:52:04.660]  feel like they almost have to have some kind of bundle where you get it all. Yes. And instead
[02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:10.940]  of signing up for the arcade and for Apple music and for Apple TV plus and, and for Apple
[02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:16.020]  news, am I missing one that they charge for channels channels? I think they kind of have
[02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:20.100]  to do separately just because of the nature of channels. Channels is a little different,
[02:52:20.100 --> 02:52:27.580]  so let's ignore the channels for now. But if for 25 bucks a month you could get music
[02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:34.180]  TV plus original shows and Apple arcade and Apple news and it's all shared with your family,
[02:52:34.180 --> 02:52:41.360]  25 bucks a month or 20 maybe 20 I don't know, 20, 25 bucks a month. I do 25 man that's appealing.
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:46.640]  And then, you know, then even if TV plus is 10 bucks a month, even though they only have
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:51.140]  like 10 shows at the beginning and if you, all you want is TV plus it's 10 bucks a month.
[02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:55.300]  Well, don't get that. Just get the $25 bundle and you get the music and you get the arcade
[02:52:55.300 --> 02:53:00.860]  and you get the news all together and you're, you know, if you added it all up and you bought
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:04.700]  them separately, maybe it would be like $35 or something like that. So instead of paying
[02:53:04.700 --> 02:53:10.580]  35 you can pay 25. They didn't mention anything about a bundle at the services event, but
[02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:15.700]  you know, they didn't mention anything really about a pricing or anything other than news
[02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:20.960]  because news was actually coming out soon. So they told us what news costs. I forget
[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:26.340]  what news costs. What is news costs? Is it 10 bucks a month? Oh geez, I forget too. I
[02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:34.120]  have it. Yeah, I do too. No idea what it costs. We probably should look. Yeah. See, they're
[02:53:34.120 --> 02:53:39.620]  counting on people like us. I don't know how much it costs. I just buy it. Well, we get
[02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:52.380]  3% cash back. Oh, that's awesome. Uh, let's see here. Apple news. Uh, uh, it's 10 bucks
[02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:57.180]  a month. Yeah. Okay. So if that's 10 bucks a month and the TV is 10 bucks a month, now
[02:53:57.180 --> 02:54:02.620]  you're at 20. We know Apple music is 10 or 15, right? Yeah. Depending on if you have
[02:54:02.620 --> 02:54:08.500]  family sharing now, all the other stuff other than music they've already promised will include
[02:54:08.500 --> 02:54:13.540]  family sharing by default. Music is the one that's different right now where there's two
[02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:21.100]  tiers, single and family. Um, so that's, let's just say TV's 10 news is 10 year at 20. You're
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:26.140]  at least at 30 with music. If you don't have family sharing, you're at 35 if you get family
[02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:30.400]  sharing and then arcade is five year at 40 bucks if you bought them all separately, right?
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.660]  And you're getting nickel. You feel like you're getting nickeled and dime because now you've
[02:54:32.660 --> 02:54:38.320]  signed up for four different things, 40 bucks for all of them separately, 25 bucks and you
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:45.860]  just get it, call it Apple plus or something Apple plus and you get it all. That to me
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:51.700]  is the that's and, and, and to me it solves their problem of we only have 10 original
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:56.740]  shows because you're not paying just for the shows. You're paying for a 5 million songs
[02:54:56.740 --> 02:55:02.680]  in Apple music and you're paying for all of these original arcade games and you're paying
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:07.020]  for a news subscription that maybe you wouldn't have gotten otherwise, but now you can read
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:14.220]  all your news without, uh, uh, getting bothered, uh, by all sorts of ugly ads and stuff. Apple
[02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:25.380]  plus max pro. I think I nailed it, John. Yeah, that's my guess. Yes, that, that sounds good.
[02:55:25.380 --> 02:55:32.980]  I would do that. My guess as, as to the Apple event is, uh, it opens up, uh, I guess, uh,
[02:55:32.980 --> 02:55:42.420]  uh, what's his name? CFO, COO, Jeff Williams, Jeff Williams. Well, Tim Cook comes out, uh,
[02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:46.460]  invites Jeff Williams on stage. It'll tell us about the Apple watch series. What are
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:53.500]  we up to? Five. Uh, tell us all about the new stuff. Uh, and then Tim will come back
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:56:00.660]  out, uh, call out Phil Schiller. Tell us about new iPhones. I, I suspect that this year they'll
[02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:07.740]  do iPhone 11 first, the XR 10 are replaced. Now you got me saying XR, Jim, I don't know
[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:13.540]  why I did that today. Then, then the iPhone, uh, you know, tennis replacements, the iPhone
[02:56:13.540 --> 02:56:19.660]  11 pro and pro max and a big segment on how awesome the camera is and the extra video,
[02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:26.340]  blah, blah, blah. And then, you know, an hour and 15 minutes into it after, you know, watch
[02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:31.900]  and phone, then boom, here's the, here's the full story on services. Yep. And man, if they
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:42.500]  pull it off, I, I, the music is funny because they're at the Liberty, not Liberty, but they've
[02:56:42.500 --> 02:56:46.140]  got to negotiate with the big record labels, right? Cause what do people really want to
[02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:49.340]  listen to on Apple music? They want to listen to hit music, right? They want to listen to
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:54.660]  the new Taylor Swift. So the fact that they have to charge 15 instead of 10 to get family
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:58.540]  sharing, I'm sure is part of, you know, I think Apple would probably rather just have
[02:56:58.540 --> 02:57:04.220]  $10 and you get family sharing, but I'm sure that it's some kind of licensing thing. Um,
[02:57:04.220 --> 02:57:08.620]  everything else though is really under Apple's control. Now, obviously the news stuff, you
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:11.540]  know, they have to, you know, to get the wall street journal, they got to get the wall street
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:15.740]  journal screen, but the, the news publications are not in a position of strength that the
[02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:21.180]  music labels are in, right? The news industry is struggling. The TV stuff with their original
[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:27.620]  content, Apple owns that and the arcade stuff is all original stuff made for Apple arcade,
[02:57:27.620 --> 02:57:32.460]  right? So putting it together in a bundle, the only real wildcard to me is whether they
[02:57:32.460 --> 02:57:38.060]  can include the music, right? If they can get the rights from the record labels to do
[02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:44.140]  it. And maybe the simple answer to that is they, you know, you get a $25 Apple plus subscription
[02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:49.260]  and they still give the $10 to the, you know, to the Apple music, to the record labels as
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:54.220]  though it's a $10 subscription. I think they would have to, but I think that they can control
[02:57:54.220 --> 02:58:03.900]  that as long as they keep the, um, uh, paying for the Apple music licensing. Yeah. But I,
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:09.580]  and how many onto it probably doesn't matter to the music companies. I really hope that
[02:58:09.580 --> 02:58:15.180]  they pull that off. I think it could be, uh, I think it could be, it's such a lame phrase.
[02:58:15.180 --> 02:58:21.300]  Win, win, win. But I really think it could be good for everybody involved where it's
[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:25.900]  lots of money for Apple from services, which they want cause a, they want the money and
[02:58:25.900 --> 02:58:30.260]  b, they want the narrative for wall street that we're growing the services segment of
[02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:36.500]  the industry. Um, I think more importantly for me and you and for the people listening
[02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:41.940]  to this show, I think it could be a great deal for Apple customers in terms of getting
[02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:48.140]  a lot of bang for their buck and getting a lot of cool stuff, cool games, great music,
[02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:55.460]  cool new TV shows, uh, you know, and the Apple news for whatever that's worth. Uh, and I
[02:58:55.460 --> 02:59:00.820]  think it's good for the people involved. I think that Apple arcade, from what I've heard,
[02:59:00.820 --> 02:59:06.100]  I think this is, it's a great, uh, I think it's great financially for the game developers
[02:59:06.100 --> 02:59:09.940]  and I think it allows, and it really a, I think it's good money and I think it's funding
[02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:14.900]  them to do good work, but I think it really alleviates their consciences that they're
[02:59:14.900 --> 02:59:20.860]  making games that aren't bilking people out of, you know, money like a slot machine. And
[02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:27.660]  instead they're just giving them the best game experience they can make as opposed to,
[02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:34.020]  you know, design the game entirely to be fun instead of designing the game to both be fun,
[02:59:34.020 --> 02:59:40.900]  but also addictive and make money on an ongoing basis. Just make good quality games. Yeah.
[02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:45.780]  You know? Yeah. And I, you know, who else could pull this off? Right. This, the other
[02:59:45.780 --> 02:59:50.380]  thing is that Apple does its best stuff when it's only, you know, and you know, Tim Cook
[02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:54.980]  loves to say it, but only Apple. Right. But who else can pull off a bundle like this?
[02:59:54.980 --> 03:00:00.380]  No, I, I don't disagree with you there. Yeah. Another thing just as a side effect before
[03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:07.580]  we sign off a little, not a side effect, a side note is, uh, remember the goofy story
[03:00:07.580 --> 03:00:14.820]  last year that said Tim Cook was sending notes to the TV people with, Oh, be nicer. You know,
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:19.540]  he's watching the early version. So mean, don't be so mean. And that Apple was meddling.
[03:00:19.540 --> 03:00:27.140]  There was a story by Trip Mickle who writes for the wall street journal. Um, and Eddie
[03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:31.020]  Q, I don't know if you saw this a couple of weeks ago, I was on vacation at the time,
[03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:35.620]  but there was a, he did an art and I forget if it was Esquire or GQ, I was getting confused,
[03:00:35.620 --> 03:00:40.860]  but Eddie Q did an interview with, I think GQ and he was asked about that and he said,
[03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:46.220]  that's complete nonsense. We don't, you know, we all the, our only input in this is hiring
[03:00:46.220 --> 03:00:52.300]  the best people we can find to make shows and then we trust them to do their work. Uh,
[03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:56.260]  we'd be idiots. You know, we don't know how to make TV shows. We'd be idiots to be micromanaging
[03:00:56.260 --> 03:01:02.020]  that. Um, and the thing that's interesting. Oh, so the skeptic might say, well, of course
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:06.160]  Eddie Q is going to say that cause it made Apple look bad. But I think the thing that's
[03:01:06.160 --> 03:01:11.700]  interesting about it is that nobody since has reported anything along those lines. And
[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:22.060]  Hollywood is, is a gossipy gossipy town, right? It is, it is a, they don't even call them
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:26.500]  leaks, right? I mean, it's just, it's just understood that like variety knows like about
[03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:29.180]  movies that are coming out and who's going to star in them and how much they're getting
[03:01:29.180 --> 03:01:33.380]  paid. It's, they don't even call them leaks or rumors. That's just how Hollywood works.
[03:01:33.380 --> 03:01:37.040]  Word would get around and it would have gotten around by now and there'd be a lot more stories.
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:40.760]  There was only one story that said that there hasn't been any sense. And then the other
[03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:46.100]  thing too is if that was the word on the street in Hollywood, there's no way that these top
[03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:50.260]  notch creative people would be signing more and more deals with Apple. Like it would just
[03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:52.780]  be like, why the hell am I going to sign with Apple? I'll just go to Netflix where they'll
[03:01:52.780 --> 03:01:58.180]  leave me alone or I'll go to HBO and they'll leave me alone and let me make cool stuff.
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:02:03.100]  So I think I really think that's one of those stories. It's not important like that big
[03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:08.740]  hack story from Bloomberg last year that never got followed up and never had any corroboration
[03:02:08.740 --> 03:02:13.540]  and really as time, you know, look like bullshit a day after it came out and now 11 months
[03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:19.500]  later looks like it looks like a sure thing that it was bullshit because no other publication
[03:02:19.500 --> 03:02:26.500]  corroborated it and Bloomberg itself never added a word to corroborate it. I think that
[03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.580]  story about Apple executives and Tim Cook in particular meddling with the creatives making
[03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:36.900]  the original content was a big pile of shit. Yeah, it certainly sounds it and I'm glad
[03:02:36.900 --> 03:02:41.260]  I'm glad that it was. I mean, yeah, cause that would be bad news. It would be, it would
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:47.100]  be. I mean, but you know, one thing about all of this that you said, why would creatives
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:54.380]  continue to sign up to work with Apple? Right. I mean, yeah, there's money involved, but
[03:02:54.380 --> 03:03:01.420]  these people are, you know, they like to have some respect for their, their craft, right?
[03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:05.460]  Steven Spielberg. Well, they have options. Steven Spielberg has options. Yeah. You know
[03:03:05.460 --> 03:03:13.460]  what I mean? Ron Howard. Yeah. Options. If Ron Howard calls, you know, Netflix and you
[03:03:13.460 --> 03:03:19.460]  know, I, they answer the phone. Yeah. Hey, would you mind if I made a show? Yeah. Would
[03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:24.340]  you be interested in it? Cool. They drive the, uh, you know, the armored car right down
[03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:28.740]  to his house and just unload the money right there. Where do you want us to drop the cash
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:32.780]  off in your garage? Do you want us to put it right in your bank account? Where, where's
[03:03:32.780 --> 03:03:40.700]  the cash go anyway? Well, I think that's a show, Jim. It is, uh, always a pleasure to
[03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:47.220]  talk to you. You make me laugh. Well, I'm glad. I'm glad. And it's always good to be
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:54.740]  here with you. I mean, we, we just get into to so much and it's so much fun. I love it.
[03:03:54.740 --> 03:03:58.580]  Uh, I can't believe I have to say this cause I'm sure everybody knows, but your website,
[03:03:58.580 --> 03:04:04.860]  of course the loop is at loop insight.com daily updates from you and your stable of

[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:22.700]  I call bringing the show full circle. You're good. That was good. Yeah. You know what?
[03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:28.500]  Put it in your net news wire and see if the icon looks right. Oh no, I got to go fix that.
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:34.700]  Yeah. I got to find somebody that knows how to make icons to, uh, to do that. Uh,
