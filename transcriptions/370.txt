[00:00.000 --> 00:01.740]  Jason, how you doing?
[00:01.740 --> 00:02.640]  I'm doing all right, John.
[00:02.640 --> 00:03.880]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[00:03.880 --> 00:04.900]  How's the weather up there?
[00:04.900 --> 00:07.040]  Well, it's cold because it's winter.
[00:07.040 --> 00:10.080]  It's getting lighter though, which is great.
[00:10.080 --> 00:13.820]  Late December, January here in Vermont is kind of bleak,
[00:13.820 --> 00:14.820]  to be honest.
[00:14.820 --> 00:17.520]  So I'm glad the light is getting more towards spring.
[00:17.520 --> 00:18.680]  I hate winters.
[00:18.680 --> 00:19.520]  I do.
[00:19.520 --> 00:21.720]  And my wife and I, we've been talking about like,
[00:21.720 --> 00:22.940]  why the hell do we live here?
[00:22.940 --> 00:25.800]  And I live in the tropics compared to you.
[00:25.800 --> 00:28.000]  Yeah, darkness is the worst thing up here
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.960]  because it's like significantly darker for longer here
[00:31.960 --> 00:34.840]  in December and January than it is in New York
[00:34.840 --> 00:36.040]  or down in Philly.
[00:37.240 --> 00:40.640]  And I've also found as I've gotten old,
[00:40.640 --> 00:42.960]  I was going to say older, but let's face it, old.
[00:42.960 --> 00:45.500]  You would think it would go the other way,
[00:45.500 --> 00:49.320]  that the older you get, the more you just get used to it.
[00:49.320 --> 00:51.000]  And I find the opposite.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.080]  Like I find, like when I was a kid,
[00:54.080 --> 00:57.160]  I knew that it got dark earlier in the winter.
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.880]  I mean, you just open your eyes.
[00:58.880 --> 01:02.240]  And I knew I had to come home from playing outside,
[01:02.240 --> 01:04.920]  you know, because we're so old that fairly,
[01:04.920 --> 01:07.680]  we would just come home from school
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.240]  and we'd be set loose to go run around
[01:11.240 --> 01:12.960]  with no parental supervision.
[01:12.960 --> 01:14.120]  It wasn't just my parents.
[01:14.120 --> 01:16.880]  It was like the neighborhood rule for all the parents.
[01:16.880 --> 01:19.400]  You have to come home when the street lights come on.
[01:19.400 --> 01:22.220]  We didn't wear watches, you know, that was the rule.
[01:22.220 --> 01:24.440]  If the street lights are on, it's time to come home.
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.240]  And I knew that, boy, this kind of sucks in December.
[01:28.240 --> 01:30.360]  We don't really get much time out of school.
[01:30.360 --> 01:33.200]  But on the other hand, even like college,
[01:33.200 --> 01:35.760]  I don't really remember being like bummed out
[01:35.760 --> 01:37.720]  that it's dark early or anything,
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.320]  I guess because also in college,
[01:39.320 --> 01:43.320]  you kind of live and sleep on whatever cycle you want
[01:43.320 --> 01:46.440]  as long as you can submit your homework.
[01:46.440 --> 01:47.800]  I was going to say go to class,
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.840]  but I skipped a lot of classes.
[01:49.840 --> 01:52.360]  But now that I'm an adult,
[01:52.360 --> 01:55.480]  I really get bummed in December, even November.
[01:55.480 --> 01:58.840]  I do, and I know they call it seasonal affect disorder
[01:58.840 --> 02:01.160]  or whatever, I don't know if I have any disorder.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.240]  I just get bummed.
[02:03.240 --> 02:05.720]  Yeah, yeah, I mean, me too.
[02:05.720 --> 02:08.340]  I mean, so I grew up in Wisconsin
[02:08.340 --> 02:11.200]  and was fine with it as a kid.
[02:11.200 --> 02:12.740]  I never remember being bummed out.
[02:12.740 --> 02:16.520]  And even when I lived in New York from,
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.200]  how long was it, 2002 to 2016, I guess,
[02:21.200 --> 02:23.620]  it didn't really bother me a whole lot there either.
[02:23.620 --> 02:25.720]  And then when I moved up here,
[02:25.720 --> 02:27.760]  like the first winter was okay
[02:27.760 --> 02:30.320]  and the second one just totally just kicked my ass.
[02:30.320 --> 02:32.520]  I was just like, what the hell happened?
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.080]  I feel like I got hit by a freight train.
[02:34.080 --> 02:37.500]  I also do notice though, the flip side of it
[02:37.500 --> 02:42.480]  is I do notice the expanding daylight hours more.
[02:42.480 --> 02:44.440]  So it's like, I get more bummed.
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.160]  I do, I really get more bummed in November and December.
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.640]  I find January and February, or at least early February
[02:51.640 --> 02:54.400]  to be dreary, but right around now, late February
[02:54.400 --> 02:58.200]  or recording on March 3rd, it's like looking up.
[02:58.200 --> 03:02.280]  And I also find that when daylight savings time
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.280]  finally kicks back in, it's like the best gift
[03:07.760 --> 03:08.600]  of the year to me.
[03:08.600 --> 03:10.520]  I mean, no offense to my family
[03:10.520 --> 03:13.920]  and all the actual gifts they give to me.
[03:13.920 --> 03:16.720]  But the day where I look at my watch
[03:16.720 --> 03:18.760]  and it's six o'clock, seven o'clock
[03:18.760 --> 03:20.520]  and it's like still plenty of light outside,
[03:20.520 --> 03:21.960]  I'm like, woo!
[03:23.300 --> 03:24.520]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.320]  Here in Vermont, like I've noticed the last few winters,
[03:29.320 --> 03:33.480]  like the first day where it's sunny
[03:33.480 --> 03:36.400]  and the thermometer's pushing like 65, 70,
[03:36.400 --> 03:38.960]  it feels like nothing else.
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.120]  I will go outside in like shirt sleeves and shorts
[03:43.120 --> 03:46.040]  and I work outside and I'm just like, this is awesome.
[03:46.040 --> 03:48.880]  And I can't believe I was this depressed
[03:48.880 --> 03:50.240]  for the last three months.
[03:50.240 --> 03:51.080]  Right, you mean like just-
[03:51.080 --> 03:52.240]  Yeah, you feel like a million bucks.
[03:52.240 --> 03:53.720]  Right, you're sitting there working on cocky,
[03:53.720 --> 03:55.840]  the laptop, you know, outside
[03:55.840 --> 03:59.440]  and breathing that fresh air.
[03:59.440 --> 04:01.080]  Exactly, yep.
[04:01.080 --> 04:03.480]  And there's like literally like still probably
[04:03.480 --> 04:06.060]  like three feet of snow out in the yard or whatever,
[04:06.060 --> 04:08.120]  but it's because we have global warming now,
[04:08.120 --> 04:09.840]  every once in a while in March, you know,
[04:09.840 --> 04:10.880]  like mid-March or whatever,
[04:10.880 --> 04:12.760]  it's oh, it's gonna be 70 degrees for a little bit.
[04:12.760 --> 04:14.400]  And then it goes back to, you know,
[04:14.400 --> 04:17.800]  we're gonna have an ice storm three days later, so.
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.200]  Yeah, we had that a few weeks ago
[04:19.200 --> 04:21.800]  where there was a stretch here in February,
[04:21.800 --> 04:24.100]  which is always the worst month from New York.
[04:24.100 --> 04:26.280]  It's way worse than January, in my opinion.
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.160]  We had a couple of days in the 60s.
[04:28.160 --> 04:31.680]  I've lived my whole life either outside Philadelphia
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.560]  growing up or in Philadelphia
[04:33.560 --> 04:35.820]  other than two years up in Massachusetts,
[04:35.820 --> 04:39.200]  but I'm super familiar at this point
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.880]  with the annual temperature, what's a nice day,
[04:42.880 --> 04:45.360]  what's a bad day for any day of the year.
[04:45.360 --> 04:50.360]  And it's like even if I didn't know logically,
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.240]  if I had never read the news
[04:52.240 --> 04:54.280]  and had never heard of climate change,
[04:54.280 --> 04:56.560]  I would know something is up.
[04:56.560 --> 04:57.400]  You know what I mean?
[04:57.400 --> 05:00.760]  It's like you could literally be a hermit,
[05:00.760 --> 05:03.120]  you know, like a Ted Kaczynski living in a shack
[05:03.120 --> 05:05.120]  with no internet, no newspapers,
[05:05.120 --> 05:07.040]  and you'd be like, hey, what's up with the weather?
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.400]  Am I wrong about what date it is?
[05:09.400 --> 05:11.520]  I've been coming up here to Vermont
[05:11.520 --> 05:14.660]  since, I don't know, 2003, something like that.
[05:14.660 --> 05:17.040]  And you can tell by the ski areas
[05:17.040 --> 05:20.000]  and you can tell by how much snow there is at the ski areas
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.700]  and how much they're able to be open
[05:22.700 --> 05:25.960]  and when they can open for the season initially
[05:25.960 --> 05:28.060]  and when they close at the end of the season.
[05:28.060 --> 05:30.480]  And it's that season is just getting shorter.
[05:30.480 --> 05:33.640]  And you get these weird warmups in the middle of January,
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.480]  in the middle of February,
[05:34.480 --> 05:38.200]  where it rains and it's 55 degrees.
[05:38.200 --> 05:40.560]  And you just get fewer days
[05:40.560 --> 05:44.800]  and you get fewer people coming up and doing things
[05:44.800 --> 05:46.480]  and spending their money here and stuff like that.
[05:46.480 --> 05:50.000]  And it's just, yeah, you would totally be able to tell,
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.600]  even if you had never heard of climate change or whatever.
[05:53.600 --> 05:54.440]  It's just different.
[05:54.440 --> 05:56.540]  I should know this as a long time,
[05:57.560 --> 05:58.800]  as we're about to get to,
[05:58.800 --> 06:01.360]  very long time, reader of your website.
[06:02.520 --> 06:04.240]  I feel like I should definitely know this
[06:04.240 --> 06:07.080]  because it seems like total Kottke fodder,
[06:07.080 --> 06:11.280]  but are you at daylight savings time year round, man, or not?
[06:11.280 --> 06:13.720]  I mean, I don't think they should switch back and forth.
[06:13.720 --> 06:14.880]  So which one do you think?
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.840]  I mean, obviously, if they're only gonna have one,
[06:16.840 --> 06:18.240]  it's gonna be daylight savings time
[06:18.240 --> 06:21.640]  because we're already at eight months, four months.
[06:21.640 --> 06:25.480]  And the legal proposals are only for,
[06:25.480 --> 06:28.620]  nobody's proposing we go standard time year round,
[06:28.620 --> 06:29.460]  I don't think.
[06:29.460 --> 06:33.160]  Right, no, I mean, yeah, I would choose that, yeah.
[06:33.160 --> 06:37.240]  It's awkward for me, or at least unexpected,
[06:37.240 --> 06:39.560]  because I forget who it is who's sponsoring the bill.
[06:39.560 --> 06:41.800]  It's either Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz,
[06:41.800 --> 06:43.960]  but it doesn't matter which one.
[06:43.960 --> 06:45.120]  It doesn't matter.
[06:45.120 --> 06:47.860]  The point is, I can't believe I'm here on the side
[06:47.860 --> 06:50.760]  of legislation being proposed by whoever it is,
[06:50.760 --> 06:52.760]  but yeah, the switch sucks.
[06:52.760 --> 06:57.760]  But also, it's like, F you morning people.
[06:58.040 --> 07:01.240]  And it's the morning people who bitch and moan about,
[07:01.240 --> 07:04.280]  well, but if we switch to daylight savings time,
[07:04.280 --> 07:07.920]  it'll be so dark until like 8.30 or nine in the morning,
[07:07.920 --> 07:09.680]  you know, in the middle of winter.
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.880]  And they always bring up the kids
[07:11.880 --> 07:13.920]  at the freaking bus stop, right?
[07:13.920 --> 07:15.480]  What about the kids going to school?
[07:15.480 --> 07:17.480]  But that circles back to my point
[07:17.480 --> 07:20.280]  about the way we raise children today.
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.520]  Kids aren't unsupervised at bus stops anymore, right?
[07:23.520 --> 07:25.120]  Like when we were kids,
[07:25.120 --> 07:26.900]  your mom wouldn't even get dressed in the morning.
[07:26.900 --> 07:29.080]  Your mom would still be, you know,
[07:29.080 --> 07:31.640]  whatever she slept in and just get you out the door.
[07:31.640 --> 07:33.960]  And you know, whether you were going to a bus stop
[07:33.960 --> 07:36.840]  or walking to school or whatever, you were on your own.
[07:36.840 --> 07:38.320]  Nobody does that anymore.
[07:38.320 --> 07:39.960]  It's not a good excuse.
[07:39.960 --> 07:41.880]  The switchover is insane.
[07:41.880 --> 07:44.260]  The thing about early school times anyway,
[07:44.260 --> 07:46.360]  like we should just move the school time.
[07:46.360 --> 07:47.200]  Yes.
[07:47.200 --> 07:49.380]  Not futz around with actual time.
[07:49.380 --> 07:51.580]  Just like school should start later
[07:51.580 --> 07:53.380]  because like it's better for kids.
[07:53.380 --> 07:55.160]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.560]  There is actual research.
[07:56.560 --> 07:59.520]  This is not just me spouting off with my personal opinion
[07:59.520 --> 08:01.040]  and my vivid memories.
[08:01.040 --> 08:05.240]  My vivid memories from high school of being a total zombie.
[08:05.240 --> 08:06.900]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[08:06.900 --> 08:08.840]  My best friend and I in high school,
[08:08.840 --> 08:13.080]  we both mastered the technique of sleeping in class
[08:13.080 --> 08:15.000]  with your head, not on your desk,
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.520]  but like a certain pose where you could like
[08:17.520 --> 08:20.720]  get your chin on your palm.
[08:20.720 --> 08:24.280]  And we would choose seats in the back,
[08:24.280 --> 08:26.380]  not just, I always say I like to sit in the back
[08:26.380 --> 08:28.520]  for most of my classes just so I could screw around,
[08:28.520 --> 08:30.600]  but you had to go back corner
[08:30.600 --> 08:32.180]  and then you could like kinda turn your head
[08:32.180 --> 08:33.740]  away from the teacher.
[08:33.740 --> 08:36.720]  I got solid sleep in classes my whole,
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.800]  like probably junior and senior years.
[08:39.800 --> 08:41.120]  But it's, because it's terrible.
[08:41.120 --> 08:43.920]  I mean, we used to have to, I think it was like 8 a.m.
[08:43.920 --> 08:47.280]  And it's like the real world doesn't start at 8 a.m.
[08:47.280 --> 08:48.300]  The adult world.
[08:48.300 --> 08:49.140]  Yeah, exactly.
[08:50.060 --> 08:52.960]  Anyway, well, as I hinted,
[08:52.960 --> 08:54.740]  we are here to talk about the fact
[08:54.740 --> 08:57.020]  that you've been writing your website for,
[08:57.020 --> 08:59.640]  well, let's just say it, 25 fuckin' years.
[09:01.760 --> 09:03.920]  Yes, 25 fuckin' years.
[09:03.920 --> 09:05.760]  When is the official anniversary?
[09:05.760 --> 09:06.880]  Do you know the date?
[09:08.320 --> 09:10.240]  Yeah, so it's March 14th.
[09:10.240 --> 09:11.760]  All right, so we'll be out before.
[09:11.760 --> 09:14.800]  We're a little ahead of your anniversary, but.
[09:15.760 --> 09:18.360]  I'll just start by saying congrats.
[09:18.360 --> 09:21.280]  I mean, I don't know what more to say.
[09:21.280 --> 09:23.000]  I mean, I'm glad you're at it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.960]  I was looking as research.
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.800]  I actually did some actual homework for this show
[09:27.800 --> 09:29.480]  on every other episode of this.
[09:30.920 --> 09:32.280]  All three.
[09:32.280 --> 09:34.760]  All 369 preceding episodes.
[09:34.760 --> 09:36.280]  Right, this is the first one.
[09:36.280 --> 09:39.400]  I found your 10th anniversary post.
[09:39.400 --> 09:41.260]  Well, I found, like it's hard to find.
[09:41.260 --> 09:45.500]  But you said see you in 2008, or no, 2018.
[09:45.500 --> 09:47.460]  So let me start by saying this.
[09:47.460 --> 09:48.680]  Let me ask this.
[09:48.680 --> 09:53.680]  In the early years, when you first started kaki.org,
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.600]  did you have a sense that even then that you'd be doing it?
[10:00.600 --> 10:03.040]  If all things go well, knock on wood,
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.520]  health stays up, nuclear war doesn't happen,
[10:07.520 --> 10:09.320]  the internet stays open,
[10:09.320 --> 10:11.640]  that you'd still be doing this now?
[10:11.640 --> 10:13.420]  I would say no.
[10:13.420 --> 10:14.980]  There's rarely been a plan.
[10:14.980 --> 10:17.900]  I think the whole thing has just happened really organically.
[10:17.900 --> 10:20.360]  I started it because like, oh,
[10:20.360 --> 10:22.800]  I wanted to have a place to write things down.
[10:22.800 --> 10:25.280]  And so at the time I was doing this other website
[10:25.280 --> 10:28.480]  called Oscillate, and that was more sort of visual
[10:28.480 --> 10:29.960]  and it was like episodic.
[10:29.960 --> 10:33.680]  Like every few weeks I would release a new episode.
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.500]  But people had started blogging
[10:35.500 --> 10:38.000]  and there were online diaries and all this sort of stuff.
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.740]  And I decided, oh, I want to try this out.
[10:41.740 --> 10:44.760]  And people read it and liked it.
[10:44.760 --> 10:48.440]  And so I kept writing and it became slowly
[10:48.440 --> 10:52.040]  sort of like more and more of kind of my online life.
[10:52.040 --> 10:54.600]  And even the decision to like,
[10:54.600 --> 10:57.820]  I went full-time like as a job in 2005.
[10:57.820 --> 11:01.160]  And even that wasn't, that was like a few months before
[11:01.160 --> 11:03.940]  I had lunch with Anil Dash.
[11:03.940 --> 11:06.040]  And we were just talking about this and that.
[11:06.040 --> 11:07.400]  And he sort of like,
[11:07.400 --> 11:09.700]  I can't remember what we were talking about exactly,
[11:09.700 --> 11:11.680]  but he was kind of like,
[11:11.680 --> 11:13.240]  I bet if you really wanted to do it,
[11:13.240 --> 11:15.720]  like you could do your website as a full-time job,
[11:15.720 --> 11:16.960]  like you could find advertising
[11:16.960 --> 11:19.440]  or get people to pay or whatever.
[11:19.440 --> 11:21.240]  He's like, I bet you could do it.
[11:21.240 --> 11:22.560]  And I was like, huh.
[11:22.560 --> 11:25.740]  And then I was thinking about it after that.
[11:25.740 --> 11:27.920]  And I was like, wait a minute, that might be cool.
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.680]  So yeah, so there was never any drive to be sort of
[11:31.680 --> 11:34.700]  long lasting or anything like that.
[11:34.700 --> 11:37.200]  It just sort of, it's just sort of what's happened.
[11:38.160 --> 11:41.240]  That's interesting because
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.240]  I wouldn't say immediately when I started Daring Fireball,
[11:46.960 --> 11:48.580]  but maybe very close.
[11:48.580 --> 11:53.280]  I at least had the hope when I started
[11:54.280 --> 11:56.760]  that maybe I could eventually figure out,
[11:56.760 --> 11:59.100]  immediately figure out a way that I could do this
[11:59.100 --> 12:01.680]  as a living and had a sense
[12:01.680 --> 12:05.760]  that I think I could do this forever.
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.100]  And by the time I went full-time in 2006,
[12:10.100 --> 12:12.700]  it was largely inspired.
[12:12.700 --> 12:15.980]  Well, I mean, it was my plan before, but sort of.
[12:17.180 --> 12:20.380]  I don't know that I would have taken the jump though in 2006
[12:20.380 --> 12:22.260]  if you hadn't already done it.
[12:22.260 --> 12:24.220]  You made me, you doing it full-time
[12:24.220 --> 12:28.820]  made me so insanely jealous that it did.
[12:28.820 --> 12:31.300]  It really did, but in a good way
[12:31.300 --> 12:35.700]  where it broke through my natural procrastination.
[12:35.700 --> 12:39.340]  Like the reason Daring Fireball's 20 as of last August,
[12:39.340 --> 12:41.020]  so five years behind you.
[12:41.020 --> 12:44.040]  But it's funny because, let me put it this way,
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.660]  for a very long time, I felt like I was a newcomer
[12:48.660 --> 12:50.340]  and you were established
[12:50.340 --> 12:53.140]  because I started five years after you, right?
[12:53.140 --> 12:57.940]  So when you're five or six, seven years old into kotki.org
[12:57.940 --> 13:00.240]  and I'm one or two years into Daring Fireball,
[13:00.240 --> 13:02.020]  it feels like I'm the newcomer.
[13:02.020 --> 13:06.260]  And when you start comparing 20 to 25,
[13:06.260 --> 13:09.540]  it feels like, yeah, what's the difference?
[13:09.540 --> 13:12.140]  We're both like last people standing
[13:12.140 --> 13:15.220]  and old men and stalwarts.
[13:15.220 --> 13:19.140]  But when I started,
[13:19.140 --> 13:21.700]  I was hoping this is like a thing that would stick.
[13:21.700 --> 13:25.980]  And I remember I had like a list of 10 or 12 articles
[13:25.980 --> 13:27.380]  that I felt like these are,
[13:27.380 --> 13:29.420]  here's 10 or 12 things I knew I wanted to write.
[13:29.420 --> 13:31.840]  Cause I didn't have my short form links at the time.
[13:31.840 --> 13:33.940]  All I had were full posts,
[13:33.940 --> 13:38.940]  more every post is an article sort of blogging,
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.140]  which was more typical.
[13:41.140 --> 13:42.980]  Well, you know, there's a mix back then.
[13:42.980 --> 13:47.620]  But I had 10 or 12 and I felt like I could keep this going.
[13:47.620 --> 13:50.340]  And I forget where I kept the list.
[13:50.340 --> 13:53.060]  It was probably already, well, I'm not sure
[13:53.060 --> 13:54.820]  which app I had it in.
[13:54.820 --> 13:58.420]  But the list kept growing faster
[13:58.420 --> 14:00.000]  than I was writing articles.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.080]  There've always been more ideas for posts
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.540]  or even things I wanna link to
[14:04.540 --> 14:06.500]  than things I actually linked to, right?
[14:06.500 --> 14:11.500]  It's, you know, and it's so weeks into it,
[14:11.620 --> 14:15.300]  I realized, you know, at least in terms of having things
[14:15.300 --> 14:18.500]  I want to write about, this seems 100% sustainable
[14:18.500 --> 14:21.340]  because that's, you know, I'm always coming up
[14:21.340 --> 14:23.500]  with more things that I could or would write about
[14:23.500 --> 14:25.860]  than I actually have time to or actually get to.
[14:26.780 --> 14:31.080]  And it really did not take me long to realize
[14:31.080 --> 14:33.020]  that I would like this to be my life's work.
[14:33.020 --> 14:36.540]  So I'm, you know, and I, you know,
[14:36.540 --> 14:39.720]  at least I've always subscribed to the strong ideas
[14:39.720 --> 14:43.520]  loosely held mantra for everything in life.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.240]  So I mean, I've all, you know,
[14:45.240 --> 14:48.420]  it wasn't like I would have bet the house on it
[14:48.420 --> 14:50.340]  even though of course I didn't own a house back then.
[14:50.340 --> 14:53.220]  But figuratively wouldn't have bet the house on it
[14:53.220 --> 14:56.060]  because I would have been open to new ideas and wonder.
[14:56.060 --> 14:57.820]  But I had that sense though
[14:57.820 --> 14:59.940]  that this is what I was meant to do.
[14:59.940 --> 15:04.300]  And in hindsight, I find it interesting
[15:04.300 --> 15:05.980]  that you didn't have that sense early on
[15:05.980 --> 15:08.420]  because it seems to me very clearly
[15:08.420 --> 15:11.020]  that what you're doing is what you were meant to do.
[15:13.420 --> 15:15.340]  Yeah, I mean, at the time, like I was, you know,
[15:15.340 --> 15:16.860]  I was still doing web design stuff
[15:16.860 --> 15:19.600]  like back in the early 2000s.
[15:19.600 --> 15:23.380]  And, you know, that was the thing that was really, you know,
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.300]  capturing my sort of imagination back then.
[15:26.300 --> 15:27.900]  And like that, you know, that started to change.
[15:27.900 --> 15:31.180]  I feel like, you know, I had this very corporate
[15:31.180 --> 15:33.500]  web design job in 2000,
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.100]  like right after I moved to New York actually,
[15:35.100 --> 15:36.940]  like 2003, 2004.
[15:36.940 --> 15:40.260]  And, you know, and that was during a time where, you know,
[15:40.260 --> 15:43.360]  like not everybody that I knew had a job then
[15:43.360 --> 15:45.940]  because of the whole.com bust,
[15:45.940 --> 15:48.060]  the sort of the hangover from that, you know,
[15:48.060 --> 15:49.600]  but it was this really corporate job.
[15:49.600 --> 15:51.620]  And I was just sort of like, you know,
[15:51.620 --> 15:52.900]  I would go to work and, you know,
[15:52.900 --> 15:56.380]  I would, the work was fairly easy.
[15:56.380 --> 15:58.480]  You know, I'd spend like a couple hours a day blogging,
[15:58.480 --> 15:59.460]  like just at work.
[15:59.460 --> 16:02.540]  And I'm sure that this is something that will resonate
[16:02.540 --> 16:04.140]  with, you know, early bloggers too.
[16:04.140 --> 16:06.820]  You know, they just stole time here and there
[16:06.820 --> 16:10.060]  from their day jobs to write on their sites.
[16:10.060 --> 16:12.100]  You know, and at a certain point I was just like,
[16:12.100 --> 16:15.440]  oh, like this is the thing that I'm actually interested in.
[16:15.440 --> 16:18.540]  Like, why don't I try and do this for a while?
[16:18.540 --> 16:21.700]  You know, and it just, you know, it was,
[16:21.700 --> 16:23.460]  and after a while it was so,
[16:23.460 --> 16:25.300]  it just worked really well, I think.
[16:25.300 --> 16:28.380]  And it worked really well for a number of different reasons.
[16:28.380 --> 16:31.600]  You know, it's, you know, the most flexible job
[16:31.600 --> 16:32.440]  in the world.
[16:32.440 --> 16:34.980]  You just move your time around almost, you know, infinitely,
[16:34.980 --> 16:36.980]  which is like fantastic, you know,
[16:36.980 --> 16:39.100]  when you've got a lot going on
[16:39.100 --> 16:41.020]  or you want to do different stuff in your life,
[16:41.020 --> 16:43.140]  or you've got little kids and you want to be home
[16:43.140 --> 16:45.300]  for dinner every night and all that sort of stuff.
[16:45.300 --> 16:47.040]  And it just fit really well.
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.100]  And like it had momentum and I just, you know, let it go.
[16:50.100 --> 16:55.340]  It dragged me along almost instead of the other way around.
[16:55.340 --> 16:58.100]  Well, and I feel that I've always been naturally suited
[16:58.100 --> 16:59.620]  to that aspect of it.
[16:59.620 --> 17:02.700]  I've never been a nine to five person at all.
[17:02.700 --> 17:04.940]  Infamously bad with deadlines.
[17:04.940 --> 17:08.660]  Even now, I mean, my iPhone reviews are always hours
[17:08.660 --> 17:12.340]  after everybody else has come out, if not end of day,
[17:12.340 --> 17:16.820]  you know, and like, and it's come full circle
[17:16.820 --> 17:21.820]  where there's a flourishing independent publishing
[17:24.020 --> 17:27.180]  of the last few years, a resurgence,
[17:27.180 --> 17:32.180]  but it's all, or at least mostly in the newsletter space.
[17:32.600 --> 17:37.600]  And my friend and dithering colleague,
[17:38.060 --> 17:41.060]  co-host Ben Thompson is coming up on 10 years
[17:41.060 --> 17:43.100]  at Stratechery, which blows my mind.
[17:43.100 --> 17:47.180]  Cause I also think of his Stratechery as being new,
[17:47.180 --> 17:50.320]  but I love his work.
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.060]  He loves doing it, but I couldn't do what he does
[17:54.060 --> 17:56.860]  because he's effectively got a deadline
[17:56.860 --> 17:59.380]  for like 8 a.m. Eastern every day,
[17:59.380 --> 18:01.640]  even though he's writing from Taiwan,
[18:01.640 --> 18:05.620]  he's got a deadline where his subscribers
[18:05.620 --> 18:10.620]  on the East coast expect today's issue of Stratechery
[18:10.620 --> 18:13.700]  in the morning, you know, as they have their coffee
[18:13.700 --> 18:15.580]  and breakfast and before they get to work.
[18:15.580 --> 18:19.900]  And I just, I say couldn't all the time
[18:19.900 --> 18:21.660]  for all sorts of things in my life,
[18:21.660 --> 18:25.580]  which means wouldn't, but I wouldn't enjoy it.
[18:25.580 --> 18:29.820]  And it really, you know, and then I would grow resentful.
[18:29.820 --> 18:32.060]  Right, that's one thing that's never happened to me
[18:32.060 --> 18:35.340]  is I've never grown resentful of the work
[18:35.340 --> 18:37.660]  and my obligations, the pressure,
[18:37.660 --> 18:40.600]  whatever pressure I feel to keep going publishing
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.020]  and do this or that.
[18:42.020 --> 18:43.480]  Whereas if I had that,
[18:44.460 --> 18:46.940]  everybody expects a newsletter at blank time.
[18:46.940 --> 18:48.660]  Doesn't matter what time of day it is, right?
[18:48.660 --> 18:51.140]  Even if I send them out at midnight or whatever,
[18:51.140 --> 18:53.500]  eventually I would be like, well, this is irritating
[18:53.500 --> 18:56.420]  because I wanna, you know, go out with friends tonight.
[18:56.420 --> 18:57.960]  I don't wanna, and I'm not finished yet,
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.260]  but I have to sit here and finish, you know.
[19:01.260 --> 19:02.620]  All right, let's go back to oscillate.
[19:02.620 --> 19:06.080]  It was spelled with a zero,
[19:06.080 --> 19:08.740]  S-I-L, and then the digit eight,
[19:08.740 --> 19:12.140]  which I'm not mocking, but just for people Googling it
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.420]  and looking for it.
[19:13.420 --> 19:18.420]  But that sort of trickery was very, feels a little 90s.
[19:19.820 --> 19:23.020]  Oh yeah, very 90s, very 90s.
[19:23.020 --> 19:27.420]  Right, and so when did oscillate start?
[19:27.420 --> 19:29.660]  And now that the website is defunct, right?
[19:29.660 --> 19:34.020]  It's like, I looked it up, it's the domain's gone, right?
[19:35.020 --> 19:37.340]  Well, so I still own the domain,
[19:37.340 --> 19:40.020]  but it went on, I can't even remember when it went offline.
[19:40.020 --> 19:41.580]  It was, I mean, it was years and years ago,
[19:41.580 --> 19:45.740]  like more than, probably more than 15 years ago already
[19:45.740 --> 19:47.020]  that it went offline.
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.980]  Again, I should have done more research.
[19:48.980 --> 19:52.220]  Are there old episodes still in the wayback machine
[19:53.500 --> 19:54.340]  on the internet archives?
[19:54.340 --> 19:55.260]  I don't actually know.
[19:55.260 --> 19:57.420]  I don't know that I've actually looked.
[19:57.420 --> 19:59.420]  Well, there might be.
[19:59.420 --> 20:02.580]  We'll leave that as a surprise for the show notes.
[20:02.580 --> 20:03.780]  Right. Sounds good.
[20:03.780 --> 20:05.920]  All right, but you mentioned
[20:05.920 --> 20:09.300]  that it was episodic, and literally the URLs
[20:09.300 --> 20:11.420]  were like oscillate, was it.com?
[20:11.420 --> 20:13.780]  I forget what the domain was.
[20:13.780 --> 20:17.620]  Yeah, oscillate.com slash like episodes slash,
[20:17.620 --> 20:19.220]  and then it was the date, and then it was like
[20:19.220 --> 20:20.740]  whatever the name of the episode is.
[20:20.740 --> 20:24.120]  Right, and the idea in the late 90s
[20:24.120 --> 20:27.460]  that was very common on the,
[20:27.460 --> 20:31.260]  I'm just a person with a personal website,
[20:31.260 --> 20:34.180]  and I love the web, and isn't this cool
[20:34.180 --> 20:36.900]  that I can just edit HTML,
[20:36.900 --> 20:40.260]  which requires very little technical acumen
[20:40.260 --> 20:41.860]  for a technical thing, right?
[20:41.860 --> 20:44.460]  I mean, it's, and I realize not,
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.900]  there's still a slew of people who get confused,
[20:46.900 --> 20:50.980]  even by the simple HTML of the late 90s
[20:50.980 --> 20:53.380]  where almost everything was hand-edited,
[20:53.380 --> 20:55.700]  but for the most part, a non-technical person
[20:55.700 --> 20:57.300]  could just look at the source code.
[20:57.300 --> 21:00.580]  I mean, it was the genius of the mid-90s web
[21:00.580 --> 21:04.140]  was that browsers were built with the view source command,
[21:04.140 --> 21:08.420]  and you could look at it and honestly figure out
[21:08.420 --> 21:13.220]  the basic gist of HTML just by looking at it, right?
[21:13.220 --> 21:15.940]  You know, I aimed for that with Markdown, right?
[21:15.940 --> 21:20.700]  Like where you could get the basic gist of Markdown
[21:20.700 --> 21:25.240]  just by reading existing things written in Markdown.
[21:25.240 --> 21:27.580]  Oh, I get it, the asterisks mean,
[21:27.580 --> 21:30.300]  I don't know, italics or bold or something,
[21:30.300 --> 21:32.220]  and then look at the output and say,
[21:32.220 --> 21:34.580]  oh, I see single asterisks are italics
[21:34.580 --> 21:37.080]  and double asterisks are bold.
[21:37.080 --> 21:39.700]  You know, you could figure it out by looking at it,
[21:39.700 --> 21:42.580]  and I hope with Markdown even more so,
[21:42.580 --> 21:45.100]  because it's simpler, but HTML was very close to that
[21:45.100 --> 21:47.520]  in the 90s, and you'd hand-edit it,
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.060]  and what a lot of people did was this sort of,
[21:51.060 --> 21:53.620]  you know, you calling them episodes is very clever,
[21:53.620 --> 21:55.100]  because it's exactly what people did.
[21:55.100 --> 21:59.220]  They'd just occasionally make like a new toy,
[21:59.220 --> 22:02.260]  and it would be like a page or a thing,
[22:02.260 --> 22:04.380]  and then they would, you know, put it out there
[22:04.380 --> 22:07.700]  and start spreading the word, you know, however it was,
[22:07.700 --> 22:09.700]  and people would have like bookmarks
[22:09.700 --> 22:11.340]  of their favorite sites, and they'd come back
[22:11.340 --> 22:14.460]  once in a while, and oh, here's a new thing from so-and-so,
[22:14.460 --> 22:17.280]  here's a new thing from, you know,
[22:17.280 --> 22:19.400]  oh, here's a new thing from Kotke at Oscillate,
[22:19.400 --> 22:21.440]  it's an episode, you know?
[22:21.440 --> 22:24.940]  And you might have one week and another the next week,
[22:24.940 --> 22:26.060]  and then maybe it's a month
[22:26.060 --> 22:27.880]  before you come up with another one.
[22:27.880 --> 22:31.120]  Yeah, exactly, there was no like publishing schedule,
[22:31.120 --> 22:33.720]  there's no RSS that you have to keep,
[22:33.720 --> 22:35.000]  there was no sense, really,
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.680]  that you had to kind of keep feeding the beast.
[22:37.680 --> 22:39.680]  In addition to the episodes that I did,
[22:39.680 --> 22:42.300]  I also, almost every time, not every time,
[22:42.300 --> 22:45.140]  but almost every time, I redesigned like the interface
[22:45.140 --> 22:47.800]  to get into the past episodes and stuff.
[22:47.800 --> 22:51.160]  So there was a new sort of like UX or UI,
[22:51.160 --> 22:53.900]  like every, with every episode, you know,
[22:53.900 --> 22:55.600]  and that's the thing that I,
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.840]  that's the thing that I love doing.
[22:57.840 --> 23:00.120]  I love, you know, we're using all these new tools,
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.480]  and there was new stuff coming out all the time.
[23:02.480 --> 23:05.120]  It's, oh, you can do JavaScript now and rollovers,
[23:05.120 --> 23:07.660]  and you can change one image to the other image.
[23:07.660 --> 23:08.780]  You know, I remember when that came out,
[23:08.780 --> 23:09.800]  and that was a huge thing,
[23:09.800 --> 23:12.240]  and so I had to go experiment with that.
[23:12.240 --> 23:15.100]  And so it's all these technologies and everybody,
[23:15.100 --> 23:17.820]  it just felt like this huge, bubbling,
[23:17.820 --> 23:20.240]  like cauldron of creativity,
[23:20.240 --> 23:22.100]  and everyone was trying to like,
[23:22.100 --> 23:23.300]  what about this cool thing?
[23:23.300 --> 23:24.300]  What about this cool thing?
[23:24.300 --> 23:27.480]  And just trying to demonstrate through like this HTML
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.760]  and through like design and stuff like that,
[23:29.760 --> 23:31.680]  like what you could actually do,
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.700]  and also what the web could actually do,
[23:33.700 --> 23:36.760]  because like in 1996, 1997,
[23:36.760 --> 23:38.300]  like we didn't really know
[23:38.300 --> 23:40.880]  what the web was capable of completely.
[23:40.880 --> 23:42.700]  All right, when did Oscillate start?
[23:42.700 --> 23:44.240]  Everyone was trying to figure it out.
[23:44.240 --> 23:45.700]  When did Oscillate start?
[23:45.700 --> 23:48.400]  Like 90, I think early 96.
[23:49.680 --> 23:50.640]  That's so-
[23:50.640 --> 23:53.660]  And I'd had a couple of personal sites before that,
[23:53.660 --> 23:57.000]  but Oscillate I think started properly in early 96.
[23:57.000 --> 23:57.920]  Yeah, see that?
[23:59.840 --> 24:00.680]  That's what I mean though
[24:00.680 --> 24:02.520]  about you being meant to do this,
[24:02.520 --> 24:04.640]  because that's so early.
[24:04.640 --> 24:06.080]  I don't think you even realize
[24:06.080 --> 24:10.220]  what a sense for the web you have that was innate,
[24:10.220 --> 24:14.000]  because I didn't have a website anywhere close to then.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.740]  I learned how to make websites,
[24:15.740 --> 24:18.280]  and then when I graduated college in 1996,
[24:18.280 --> 24:22.240]  was doing freelance so-and-so needs a website,
[24:22.240 --> 24:24.720]  and make a website for them,
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.720]  but wasn't self-publishing and wasn't thinking about that.
[24:30.260 --> 24:32.960]  I guess I was sort of thinking about it,
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.960]  but I was too obsessed with form,
[24:39.640 --> 24:42.360]  but not the form of an individual page,
[24:42.360 --> 24:45.960]  but the form of the publication,
[24:45.960 --> 24:49.520]  which to me is what that episodic nature of Oscillate
[24:49.520 --> 24:51.400]  was sort of, that was the form.
[24:51.400 --> 24:53.840]  It was just periodic episodes,
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.840]  and coming from my only true public publishing background
[25:01.080 --> 25:03.360]  was the student newspaper at Drexel,
[25:03.360 --> 25:04.740]  and it was a weekly,
[25:04.740 --> 25:09.740]  and I've always been a media junkie of all kinds.
[25:10.120 --> 25:11.360]  I know you are too,
[25:12.280 --> 25:16.560]  but that concept of issues was so deeply ingrained
[25:16.560 --> 25:20.360]  in my brain that it took me a long time.
[25:20.360 --> 25:21.840]  I couldn't get around it,
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.000]  because it didn't seem like issues were right for the web,
[25:26.000 --> 25:30.120]  but I couldn't figure out what was right for the web,
[25:30.120 --> 25:35.120]  and it paralyzed me from doing anything for years,
[25:36.280 --> 25:39.740]  and then when would you say blogs started?
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.400]  I know this is history I could theoretically look up, but.
[25:46.020 --> 25:49.100]  Yeah, I mean, I think Robot Wisdom,
[25:49.100 --> 25:54.100]  like he created a web blog in 1998, maybe 97,
[25:54.220 --> 25:56.600]  probably 97, I would say,
[25:56.600 --> 25:59.880]  but people had diary-ish sort of things,
[25:59.880 --> 26:03.040]  like online diaries going back to Justin Hall,
[26:03.040 --> 26:04.480]  Justin's Links from the Underground.
[26:04.480 --> 26:06.000]  He started that in 1994,
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  and it was basically like a stream of consciousness,
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.720]  like diary of his life and what he was up to,
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.400]  and I think that people experimented
[26:14.400 --> 26:16.040]  with all sorts of different forms.
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.520]  There were definitely web publications that had issues,
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.680]  and I think that later it became like,
[26:23.680 --> 26:25.020]  we're not gonna worry about an issue.
[26:25.020 --> 26:29.240]  We're just gonna publish whatever we want as we go along,
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.360]  and then blogs came along and just supercharged that,
[26:32.360 --> 26:35.320]  and everybody was sort of off to the races.
[26:35.320 --> 26:36.640]  Does anything that you did,
[26:36.640 --> 26:39.440]  any of the episodes that oscillate stand out to you
[26:39.440 --> 26:40.380]  as like a favorite?
[26:42.040 --> 26:43.360]  Ooh, man.
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.120]  I mean, honestly, it's been a long time
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.340]  since I've even looked at,
[26:46.340 --> 26:49.120]  or I have all the files or whatever
[26:49.120 --> 26:50.400]  like sitting on my hard drive,
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.940]  and it's just been a long time since I've looked at those.
[26:53.940 --> 26:58.940]  I remember there was one where I wanted to do this.
[27:00.520 --> 27:02.760]  This was right in the age
[27:02.760 --> 27:05.160]  of sort of the early JavaScript experiments,
[27:05.160 --> 27:08.440]  and I had these conceptual ideas that I wanted to do.
[27:08.440 --> 27:10.520]  I was like, this should be possible,
[27:10.520 --> 27:13.560]  but I don't have quite the technical ability
[27:13.560 --> 27:15.580]  to figure out how to do it,
[27:15.580 --> 27:17.480]  and so I worked with a friend of mine.
[27:17.480 --> 27:21.480]  We constructed a page of frames.
[27:21.480 --> 27:22.300]  Remember frames?
[27:22.300 --> 27:23.140]  Oh, of course.
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.320]  I never actually used them.
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.960]  I never built a website with them
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.120]  because I hated them from the start, but I do.
[27:30.120 --> 27:31.880]  Yeah, no, I couldn't stand them.
[27:31.880 --> 27:32.720]  I couldn't stand them,
[27:32.720 --> 27:33.920]  but for this, it was like,
[27:33.920 --> 27:35.760]  I'm gonna make this thing out of frame,
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.480]  so it was out of frames
[27:37.480 --> 27:40.000]  where the scroll bars spelled out oscillate,
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.960]  and then the scroll bars moved randomly up and down,
[27:44.960 --> 27:46.180]  so the whole thing was kind of like
[27:46.180 --> 27:49.020]  this pulsing kind of scroll bar logo thing,
[27:49.020 --> 27:51.660]  and that was, yeah, that's one of my,
[27:51.660 --> 27:53.360]  yeah, I like that one a lot,
[27:53.360 --> 27:56.220]  because it was one of those things
[27:56.220 --> 27:57.900]  where it was like, I haven't seen this done,
[27:57.900 --> 28:00.420]  and people are gonna lose their shit a little bit
[28:00.420 --> 28:01.380]  when they see this.
[28:01.380 --> 28:02.540]  Right.
[28:02.540 --> 28:04.420]  It's a total abuse of the purpose,
[28:04.420 --> 28:05.960]  but it's extremely clever,
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.020]  and that's a perfect example for you to recall
[28:09.020 --> 28:10.460]  because that's the sort of thing
[28:10.460 --> 28:12.900]  that I'm calling a toy that was,
[28:12.900 --> 28:14.860]  that's what we did back then, right?
[28:14.860 --> 28:17.260]  And you would figure out something like this,
[28:17.260 --> 28:18.940]  and then if it was clever like that,
[28:18.940 --> 28:20.340]  I vaguely remember that.
[28:20.340 --> 28:22.080]  I don't know if that's a false memory or not,
[28:22.080 --> 28:24.100]  but I know I read oscillate,
[28:24.100 --> 28:26.980]  and I kind of think I remember it.
[28:26.980 --> 28:28.060]  I remember thinking, yeah,
[28:28.060 --> 28:30.460]  that's finally a good use of frames.
[28:33.660 --> 28:35.960]  Yeah, I mean, the whole atmosphere back then
[28:35.960 --> 28:39.940]  was like, it was so playful, it was so playful.
[28:39.940 --> 28:41.780]  Hold that thought, let's hold that thought.
[28:41.780 --> 28:43.940]  Let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor,
[28:43.940 --> 28:46.540]  is our very good friends who are in,
[28:46.540 --> 28:48.800]  I got an iPad in one hand reading this,
[28:48.800 --> 28:51.180]  and I've got some of their product in my right hand
[28:51.180 --> 28:55.120]  right now, it's our good friends at Trade Coffee.
[28:55.120 --> 28:57.540]  If you love drinking coffee every morning,
[28:57.540 --> 29:00.160]  and who doesn't, what kind of a sicko,
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.820]  you have to check out Trade Coffee.
[29:01.820 --> 29:04.080]  Trade makes it effortless to brew better coffee
[29:04.080 --> 29:05.080]  every time at home.
[29:05.080 --> 29:09.000]  Trade empowers coffee lovers to discover better coffee,
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.660]  because it's delivered fresh to your door.
[29:11.660 --> 29:14.280]  Trade is not a roaster themselves.
[29:14.280 --> 29:16.380]  It's not like Trade is a coffee company,
[29:16.380 --> 29:19.660]  and you get bags of coffee that say Trade Coffee on it.
[29:19.660 --> 29:21.700]  Trade is a coffee subscription service,
[29:21.700 --> 29:25.440]  and they connect to the nation's top-rated,
[29:25.440 --> 29:28.740]  independent roasters all across the country.
[29:28.740 --> 29:30.860]  I mean, dozens and dozens and dozens.
[29:30.860 --> 29:33.080]  I've been subscribed to them for, I think,
[29:33.080 --> 29:34.960]  almost a year now at this point,
[29:34.960 --> 29:37.020]  and I don't know if I've gotten coffee
[29:37.020 --> 29:39.020]  from the same roaster twice.
[29:39.020 --> 29:40.740]  That's how many independent roasters they have,
[29:40.740 --> 29:43.580]  and that's how much variety you get from Trade.
[29:43.580 --> 29:46.780]  It's a subscription service, and they make it super simple
[29:46.780 --> 29:50.460]  to both discover new coffees that are excellent
[29:50.460 --> 29:53.580]  and never run out of fresh beans at home
[29:53.580 --> 29:54.940]  without ever going shopping.
[29:54.940 --> 29:57.360]  Whether you know what you like or are new
[29:57.360 --> 29:59.860]  to specialty coffee, their website will make it easy
[29:59.860 --> 30:01.480]  and convenient to discover new coffees.
[30:01.480 --> 30:05.180]  They send it fresh to your home on your preferred schedule,
[30:05.180 --> 30:08.400]  and the scheduling flexibility, I can't imagine.
[30:08.400 --> 30:11.980]  It's the exact perfect balance of it's very simple.
[30:11.980 --> 30:13.660]  It's a simple interface to figure out
[30:13.660 --> 30:15.320]  how often you wanna get it,
[30:15.320 --> 30:19.000]  but it's also got all the flexibility you would want.
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.300]  A bag a week, a bag every other week,
[30:21.300 --> 30:22.900]  a bag every three weeks.
[30:22.900 --> 30:25.900]  More than that, if you're buying coffee for an office
[30:25.900 --> 30:28.120]  or some kind of large group thing,
[30:28.120 --> 30:31.740]  take a pause when you go on vacation,
[30:31.740 --> 30:33.580]  adjust it on the fly.
[30:33.580 --> 30:35.620]  If you figure out, hey, I keep running out
[30:35.620 --> 30:37.020]  before I get my next bag,
[30:37.020 --> 30:38.980]  I should get it a little bit more frequently,
[30:38.980 --> 30:41.940]  or let me get it less frequently
[30:41.940 --> 30:43.580]  because I'm starting to stock pile it.
[30:43.580 --> 30:45.980]  It is so easy to manage.
[30:45.980 --> 30:49.940]  Once you sign up, you never run out of fresh coffee beans,
[30:49.940 --> 30:51.940]  and the freshness, I'm telling you,
[30:51.940 --> 30:53.740]  I always emphasize this when I talk about trade.
[30:53.740 --> 30:55.940]  It is the most important factor in coffee,
[30:55.940 --> 30:57.700]  more important than anything else.
[30:57.700 --> 30:59.220]  Coffee, roasted coffee,
[30:59.220 --> 31:00.740]  even though it doesn't look like a produce,
[31:00.740 --> 31:03.980]  it is a produce, and when trade coffee arrives,
[31:03.980 --> 31:05.560]  there's always a date when it was roasted,
[31:05.560 --> 31:07.340]  and it's usually three or four days
[31:07.340 --> 31:08.540]  before it's in your hands.
[31:08.540 --> 31:09.800]  It's that fresh.
[31:09.800 --> 31:12.700]  You will never get three or four day old coffee
[31:12.700 --> 31:14.380]  off the shelf in a supermarket,
[31:14.380 --> 31:16.060]  no matter how good your supermarket is.
[31:16.060 --> 31:18.340]  So upgrade your morning routine with Better Coffee.
[31:18.340 --> 31:21.700]  Right now, Trade is offering listeners a free bag of coffee
[31:21.700 --> 31:24.580]  with any subscription at www.drinktrade.com
[31:24.580 --> 31:26.940]  slash the talk show.
[31:26.940 --> 31:30.260]  That's www.drinktrade.com
[31:30.260 --> 31:32.940]  slash the talk show for a free bag of coffee
[31:32.940 --> 31:34.340]  with any subscription purchase.
[31:34.340 --> 31:36.260]  www.drinktrade.com
[31:36.260 --> 31:39.140]  slash the talk show.
[31:40.420 --> 31:43.020]  One difference between podcasting and blogging, Jason,
[31:43.020 --> 31:46.500]  is that you gotta repeat the URL multiple times
[31:46.500 --> 31:47.660]  when you're podcasting.
[31:49.100 --> 31:51.420]  Yes, very important.
[31:51.420 --> 31:54.640]  I think about that every time I do a sponsor read,
[31:54.640 --> 31:57.460]  which is, I don't know, nine, 10 times a month.
[31:57.460 --> 31:59.540]  Every single time, I think, goddamn it,
[31:59.540 --> 32:01.700]  if I were writing, I wouldn't have to do this.
[32:01.700 --> 32:03.180]  Because I'll tell you, the one thing,
[32:03.180 --> 32:04.260]  I enjoy doing this show,
[32:04.260 --> 32:06.580]  and I especially enjoy doing special episodes like this.
[32:06.580 --> 32:08.340]  I'm already having a lot of fun.
[32:08.340 --> 32:10.260]  So I'm not trying to bitch and moan
[32:10.260 --> 32:12.460]  about my second job as a podcaster,
[32:12.460 --> 32:15.860]  but I will never, ever, ever, no matter how long I do this,
[32:15.860 --> 32:17.940]  and again, this is episode 370,
[32:17.940 --> 32:21.000]  and there was a whole slew of shows with Dan Benjamin
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.100]  before that that don't even count in the numbering.
[32:24.100 --> 32:26.700]  I will never, ever, not think of myself
[32:26.700 --> 32:30.100]  as a writer slash blogger, whatever you wanna call
[32:30.100 --> 32:33.480]  what I do at Daring Fireball, who podcasts on the side.
[32:33.480 --> 32:35.500]  That's how I view myself.
[32:35.500 --> 32:37.180]  It doesn't matter how long I do.
[32:37.180 --> 32:40.980]  So we were talking about those early, the mid-90s,
[32:40.980 --> 32:45.740]  and this sort of episodic, and this sort of coalescence
[32:45.740 --> 32:47.480]  around the idea of blogging.
[32:47.480 --> 32:50.740]  And I know it has nothing to do with either of us.
[32:50.740 --> 32:51.660]  We didn't contribute.
[32:51.660 --> 32:54.620]  But for people who are either too young
[32:54.620 --> 32:57.700]  or just don't remember or weren't paying attention to it,
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.860]  it's impossible, I think, to overstate
[33:01.860 --> 33:04.380]  the influence of suck.com.
[33:04.380 --> 33:05.220]  Right?
[33:06.580 --> 33:11.580]  Suck.com was the first thing that I looked at,
[33:14.020 --> 33:19.020]  and I'd look at things like the web toys
[33:19.020 --> 33:21.460]  that web toys people were making in other independent
[33:21.460 --> 33:24.380]  websites, and all I would think is that's fun,
[33:24.380 --> 33:27.620]  or I wonder how they did it in View Source,
[33:27.620 --> 33:30.940]  or oh, I'd love to learn that trick so I could do it.
[33:30.940 --> 33:32.820]  Oh, you just hover over a picture,
[33:32.820 --> 33:34.780]  and as soon as you hover, it substitutes
[33:34.780 --> 33:35.860]  a different picture.
[33:35.860 --> 33:37.900]  Think of all the things we could do with that.
[33:37.900 --> 33:38.740]  How do you do that?
[33:38.740 --> 33:39.980]  Oh, that's how you do it.
[33:39.980 --> 33:44.340]  But suck.com was the first website where I got jealous,
[33:44.340 --> 33:47.860]  and I thought, ah, shit, I wish I were doing
[33:47.860 --> 33:48.900]  something like that.
[33:50.160 --> 33:54.620]  Yeah, I mean, suck was a huge influence on me,
[33:54.620 --> 33:58.940]  and it was this thing where it was like,
[33:58.940 --> 34:03.900]  oh, this is, I don't think you could do this offline,
[34:03.900 --> 34:08.900]  what they're doing, and it was just so interesting
[34:09.300 --> 34:13.080]  and just so, not only the writing,
[34:13.080 --> 34:16.900]  but how they were writing and how it was designed,
[34:16.900 --> 34:20.300]  and just the whole package, it was just like,
[34:20.300 --> 34:23.140]  I can't believe there are people who are doing this
[34:23.140 --> 34:27.420]  just in their spare time at Wired Magazine or whatever,
[34:27.420 --> 34:28.700]  or Hot Wired, I guess it was.
[34:28.700 --> 34:31.820]  Right, for people who don't remember suck.com,
[34:31.820 --> 34:36.380]  number one, it also, to me, the name itself captured
[34:38.740 --> 34:42.740]  the gestalt of our generation, the Gen X generation
[34:44.980 --> 34:46.380]  in the 90s, right?
[34:46.380 --> 34:51.380]  It was, and it wasn't, even though suck.com
[34:54.720 --> 34:59.020]  doesn't sound like a serious effort, it was, right?
[34:59.020 --> 35:01.180]  Like the writing was top notch, right?
[35:01.180 --> 35:04.580]  Like my favorite suck.com writer was Heather Haverleski,
[35:04.580 --> 35:06.540]  who's still writing independently.
[35:06.540 --> 35:10.220]  Now she's floated around, she's written books,
[35:10.220 --> 35:14.580]  and she was at New York Magazine or one of the sub brands,
[35:14.580 --> 35:16.580]  and now she's got a subset, still going strong
[35:16.580 --> 35:17.540]  as an independent writer.
[35:17.540 --> 35:21.080]  But man, when I saw her byline at suck.com,
[35:21.080 --> 35:24.540]  I knew it was gonna be good, I just loved her style.
[35:24.540 --> 35:26.780]  But exactly what you said too,
[35:26.780 --> 35:31.700]  where she just instantly got a style and form of writing
[35:31.700 --> 35:34.980]  that had no real analog in print, right?
[35:34.980 --> 35:38.500]  Like the hyperlinks were part of the style.
[35:40.100 --> 35:41.820]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[35:41.820 --> 35:46.460]  There was information to be gotten
[35:46.460 --> 35:49.900]  from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it,
[35:49.900 --> 35:53.060]  which word they decided to make the hyperlink.
[35:53.060 --> 35:55.140]  It was fascinating, it was fascinating.
[35:55.140 --> 36:00.140]  Right, imagine if you lived on an island
[36:00.860 --> 36:04.320]  where all you had were manual typewriters,
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.700]  and the only form of writing that anybody had
[36:08.700 --> 36:13.100]  was with a typewriter, and then somebody comes up
[36:13.100 --> 36:16.540]  with a way to do italics.
[36:16.540 --> 36:21.480]  Well, then you can put in, I use italics liberally,
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.100]  I've always done it in my writing as to emphasize,
[36:25.100 --> 36:30.100]  you know, inflect words that I hear in my head
[36:30.820 --> 36:33.100]  as I'm writing, if I were speaking them,
[36:33.100 --> 36:36.340]  I would raise my voice or do something with my voice
[36:36.340 --> 36:41.340]  to add inflection to that word, and I would feel hamstrung
[36:43.980 --> 36:46.740]  without italics, I would feel like my writing
[36:46.740 --> 36:48.060]  was missing something.
[36:49.220 --> 36:54.220]  Hyperlinks are like italics on steroids, on superpowers,
[36:54.540 --> 36:57.580]  because, right, but like you're saying, like mid-sentence
[36:57.580 --> 36:59.940]  and something, something suspiciously blank,
[36:59.940 --> 37:03.140]  and if you, just the word suspiciously at suck,
[37:03.140 --> 37:06.220]  they might link to something, and it would just be a link
[37:06.220 --> 37:09.540]  to, who knows, I don't know what the example is,
[37:09.540 --> 37:13.460]  but you know, some random thing, but it would add context,
[37:13.460 --> 37:16.240]  and it might not even be directly related to the subject
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.500]  that was being written about, but it would be interesting,
[37:18.500 --> 37:20.540]  and it adds context to what they meant
[37:20.540 --> 37:23.940]  by the word suspiciously, way more than just mere
[37:23.940 --> 37:28.940]  italicizing it or bolding it would, and it adds a dimension
[37:30.460 --> 37:33.980]  to writing that not only didn't exist before
[37:33.980 --> 37:36.660]  but couldn't exist in print.
[37:36.660 --> 37:38.580]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:38.580 --> 37:41.420]  And what's interesting is that like I took so much influence
[37:41.420 --> 37:45.260]  from that is that like I, when I write my posts still,
[37:45.260 --> 37:47.380]  I use like a text editor to write my posts,
[37:47.380 --> 37:50.700]  and then I paste them into my CMS, like very old school,
[37:50.700 --> 37:54.780]  and when I'm writing the posts, I insert hyperlinks
[37:54.780 --> 37:56.740]  as I go, I don't do them at the end,
[37:56.740 --> 37:59.480]  I can't do them at the end, actually.
[37:59.480 --> 38:02.740]  Like I have to do them while I'm thinking about
[38:02.740 --> 38:07.140]  how I want, you know, whatever paragraph or sentence
[38:07.140 --> 38:10.840]  or whatever to communicate, like that,
[38:10.840 --> 38:13.180]  the hyperlink is part of the communication,
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.820]  it is doing like part of the work of the writing,
[38:17.820 --> 38:20.500]  part of the work of the communication to the audience,
[38:20.500 --> 38:22.580]  and it's, I just, I have to do it.
[38:23.540 --> 38:25.840]  Yeah, I don't know what it would be like
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.920]  to read Jason Kotke without hyperlinks mid-sentence,
[38:29.920 --> 38:32.980]  you know, it's, yeah, I really don't.
[38:32.980 --> 38:35.420]  The difference, though, is that,
[38:35.420 --> 38:37.420]  or the difference between Suck and a blog
[38:37.420 --> 38:39.660]  was that it would be like, I think Suck was,
[38:39.660 --> 38:43.240]  as I recall, a three, it was like Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.420]  I think, it was like three times a week.
[38:45.420 --> 38:46.400]  Yeah, something like that.
[38:46.400 --> 38:49.300]  And you would just go to the homepage,
[38:49.300 --> 38:53.900]  and if it was Wednesday, it was the Wednesday issue,
[38:53.900 --> 38:58.340]  episode, just, you know, but it was like justatsuck.com,
[38:58.340 --> 39:02.380]  like you didn't really go to suck.com slash,
[39:02.380 --> 39:04.800]  I mean, maybe they had, I guess they did have archives,
[39:04.800 --> 39:07.100]  and you could go back and look at the old ones,
[39:07.100 --> 39:09.540]  but the point was really, you would just go to,
[39:09.540 --> 39:12.180]  you'd just type suck.com in your browser
[39:12.180 --> 39:13.360]  and read the homepage,
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.180]  and the homepage only had that episode, you know,
[39:16.180 --> 39:18.280]  you could click a link to get to the archive,
[39:18.280 --> 39:20.900]  but it wasn't a scrolling list of,
[39:20.900 --> 39:23.300]  oh, just keep scrolling down and you get to Monday,
[39:23.300 --> 39:25.660]  and then you scroll down and you get to last Friday
[39:25.660 --> 39:28.740]  and you scroll down, you know,
[39:28.740 --> 39:30.940]  and it was the nature of Suck,
[39:30.940 --> 39:33.540]  I can't even imagine if Suck were that way, you know,
[39:33.540 --> 39:36.540]  it had a very, like I said,
[39:36.540 --> 39:41.300]  I've always been obsessed with form in media,
[39:41.300 --> 39:44.120]  so that gave Suck a form, it was like,
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.540]  you'd go to the homepage,
[39:45.540 --> 39:48.180]  and there'd be a new article three times a week,
[39:48.180 --> 39:50.340]  and that's where you read it on the homepage,
[39:50.340 --> 39:52.380]  and then you'd close it and, you know,
[39:52.380 --> 39:54.580]  go to the next bookmark in your favorite sites
[39:54.580 --> 39:57.060]  and see what else was there until you were done
[39:57.060 --> 39:59.620]  dicking around on the web for the session, you know,
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.740]  or until somebody picked up the telephone in another room
[40:04.740 --> 40:07.060]  and kicked you offline, there you go.
[40:08.540 --> 40:13.080]  Yep, but the revolution and the coalescence
[40:13.080 --> 40:16.060]  is in blogging, and it seems so obvious now,
[40:16.060 --> 40:19.040]  it's, you know, here we are a quarter century later,
[40:19.040 --> 40:22.580]  and it's, you know, it's hard to imagine
[40:22.580 --> 40:24.740]  that it had to be invented,
[40:24.740 --> 40:29.740]  but it is like that Justin Hall, the robot wisdom style,
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.340]  new stuff at the top, old stuff at the bottom,
[40:34.340 --> 40:37.200]  and it just scrolls down.
[40:38.660 --> 40:43.660]  And I remember when it first started becoming a thing,
[40:45.080 --> 40:50.080]  kind of objecting to it because it seemed like it,
[40:50.080 --> 40:55.080]  or if not objecting to it, being confused or wondering
[40:57.400 --> 41:00.080]  whether it should go top down or bottom up, right,
[41:00.080 --> 41:02.720]  because a newspaper, which is a better example
[41:02.720 --> 41:05.740]  than a magazine, because a magazine you page,
[41:05.740 --> 41:10.740]  but a newspaper, a broadsheet is tall and goes down
[41:10.740 --> 41:12.900]  and the important articles are at the top
[41:12.900 --> 41:16.240]  and the less important articles are at the bottom,
[41:16.240 --> 41:19.800]  you know, by the editors or whoever did the layout judgment.
[41:19.800 --> 41:23.520]  And it seemed counterintuitive to me,
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.880]  like that it's just, if you're gonna go chronological,
[41:27.880 --> 41:30.400]  should it go top down or bottom up?
[41:30.400 --> 41:33.080]  And then it also seemed counterintuitive to me
[41:33.080 --> 41:35.640]  that it's always just newest at the top,
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.080]  whether it was more or less important.
[41:39.080 --> 41:42.000]  It had no, it was simply chronological.
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.080]  And it took me a long time,
[41:44.080 --> 41:46.900]  it took me a long time to accept that no,
[41:46.900 --> 41:48.460]  this fits the web.
[41:48.460 --> 41:52.300]  It just chronological fits the web.
[41:52.300 --> 41:56.340]  And I'm wondering, I'm wondering when you noticed that
[41:56.340 --> 41:59.660]  and if that's when you shifted from oscillate to,
[41:59.660 --> 42:01.560]  hey, I should make a new thing.
[42:02.780 --> 42:06.820]  Yeah, I think that mirrors a lot of what I was thinking
[42:06.820 --> 42:09.420]  at the time, because in retrospect, yeah,
[42:09.420 --> 42:11.380]  like chronologically is the way to do it
[42:11.380 --> 42:14.060]  because blogs got people in the habit
[42:14.060 --> 42:17.800]  of checking sites more frequently.
[42:17.800 --> 42:20.240]  And then of course, like RSS came along
[42:20.240 --> 42:24.200]  and it became just sort of like another kind of inbox,
[42:24.200 --> 42:26.060]  I guess, that people would check
[42:26.060 --> 42:28.020]  and you could check it dozens of times a day
[42:28.020 --> 42:31.440]  if you wanted to, just flick over to your RSS reader
[42:31.440 --> 42:33.580]  and oh, John's got something new.
[42:33.580 --> 42:38.260]  So it kind of developed and also developed its habits
[42:38.260 --> 42:40.340]  in the audience as it went along.
[42:40.340 --> 42:44.700]  So chronologically became like the natural way to do it
[42:44.700 --> 42:47.740]  because like you'd already read the important stuff
[42:47.740 --> 42:49.580]  down the page like earlier in the day
[42:49.580 --> 42:52.820]  and you just want to catch up on whatever's like the newest.
[42:52.820 --> 42:54.740]  It's not an ideal thing.
[42:54.740 --> 42:58.560]  And I think that when you see like templates on ghost
[42:58.560 --> 43:01.780]  and things like that and WordPress and things like that,
[43:01.780 --> 43:06.060]  you see less purely chronological ordering.
[43:06.060 --> 43:09.100]  You can call out featured posts and things like that.
[43:09.100 --> 43:11.860]  And it looks more like an online magazine
[43:11.860 --> 43:15.000]  or an online newspaper where, like you said earlier,
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.240]  it's like the important stuff is at the top
[43:17.240 --> 43:20.020]  and the less important stuff is further down.
[43:20.020 --> 43:22.780]  But that chronological thing was like it's,
[43:22.780 --> 43:25.340]  or the reverse crown was the thing that like really,
[43:28.140 --> 43:31.140]  really made it take off in a way because it trained
[43:33.300 --> 43:35.900]  the audience to basically come by more often.
[43:35.900 --> 43:37.900]  And I count myself in that part of the audience.
[43:37.900 --> 43:40.180]  It's not like I'm pulling any master strings here.
[43:40.180 --> 43:43.140]  It's just like, we all did it at the same time
[43:43.140 --> 43:44.780]  as we went along.
[43:44.780 --> 43:49.740]  And eventually it's like when sites like
[43:49.740 --> 43:53.580]  and Gizmodo and Gawker and Engadget came out,
[43:53.580 --> 43:57.060]  they were doing 30, 40, 50 items a day
[43:57.060 --> 44:00.920]  and people were like, okay, more, let's go.
[44:03.460 --> 44:06.420]  Well, but I'm just curious what made you think though
[44:06.420 --> 44:10.340]  to switch from doing it under Oscillate
[44:10.340 --> 44:14.420]  to striking a new brand at kotke.org?
[44:14.420 --> 44:19.100]  Right, so what became kotke.org started at Oscillate
[44:19.100 --> 44:20.060]  as an episode.
[44:20.060 --> 44:22.500]  It was like, oh, I'm gonna keep a blog and do this.
[44:22.500 --> 44:25.240]  And it wasn't until maybe a year and a half later
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.040]  where I shifted those sort of archives over to its own domain
[44:30.040 --> 44:34.620]  and I think it just, from the perspective of,
[44:34.620 --> 44:39.020]  it was just way easier to update, like making episodes,
[44:39.020 --> 44:41.740]  it was like, okay, I gotta sit down, I gotta have an idea
[44:41.740 --> 44:43.340]  and then I've got to do this whole thing.
[44:43.340 --> 44:45.860]  It was just so easy to like, oh, I'm just gonna pull up
[44:45.860 --> 44:50.040]  a new, back in the old days, it was like I had a file,
[44:50.040 --> 44:51.920]  like I had an HTML file that I would just,
[44:51.920 --> 44:54.620]  I would directly edit it on the server.
[44:54.620 --> 44:56.940]  At the end, when it was done, like I would save it
[44:56.940 --> 44:58.760]  and that was it.
[44:58.760 --> 45:00.660]  Did you edit directly on the server
[45:00.660 --> 45:04.460]  or did you edit locally, double-check and then upload?
[45:04.460 --> 45:05.300]  Jim Coodall.
[45:05.300 --> 45:08.420]  No, no, it was on the server, I think,
[45:08.420 --> 45:10.740]  for longer than it should have been.
[45:10.740 --> 45:13.380]  Jim Coodall and I have talked about this
[45:13.380 --> 45:18.380]  and we both felt that in that era, we did better writing
[45:18.380 --> 45:20.580]  when we were writing directly on the server
[45:20.580 --> 45:24.540]  because it raised your, it like straightened your back
[45:24.540 --> 45:27.340]  and squared your shoulders, right?
[45:27.340 --> 45:28.820]  Because it's- Yeah, it raises the stakes, right?
[45:28.820 --> 45:30.180]  Right, I always think about the way
[45:30.180 --> 45:33.100]  that in the entire Star Wars universe,
[45:33.100 --> 45:38.100]  all the architecture is skyscraper-y or chasm-y
[45:38.220 --> 45:41.420]  and there are walkways on every planet
[45:41.420 --> 45:45.300]  and there's never a railing, right?
[45:45.300 --> 45:46.140]  Right?
[45:46.140 --> 45:46.980]  Right?
[45:47.860 --> 45:49.180]  You know what I mean?
[45:49.180 --> 45:51.780]  And that was blogging directly from production, right?
[45:51.780 --> 45:55.220]  Exactly, it's blogging directly from production
[45:55.220 --> 45:59.720]  is walking on any of those catwalks on Bespin
[45:59.720 --> 46:04.580]  or the place where Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn
[46:04.580 --> 46:08.020]  fought the Darth Maul and the prequel, you know?
[46:08.020 --> 46:09.940]  It's just, you know, any one of those things.
[46:09.940 --> 46:13.220]  Yeah, all the TV shows, they all keep it up.
[46:13.220 --> 46:15.980]  To me, it's one of my favorite traditions in science fiction
[46:15.980 --> 46:19.180]  is anywhere where there's a walkway in Star Wars.
[46:19.180 --> 46:20.300]  No railings.
[46:20.300 --> 46:22.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:22.580 --> 46:23.880]  It's like, where are the regulators?
[46:23.880 --> 46:25.620]  Are there any regulators in the Star Wars universe?
[46:25.620 --> 46:27.020]  No, none, right?
[46:27.020 --> 46:32.020]  It's like, there's a fantastic essay in there
[46:32.020 --> 46:35.980]  about the libertarian nature of safety regulations
[46:35.980 --> 46:38.900]  in the Star Wars universe, but that's what it felt like
[46:38.900 --> 46:42.100]  and, you know, it keeps you careful, you know what I mean?
[46:42.100 --> 46:46.340]  You're more likely to trip and fall on a nice, safe catwalk
[46:46.340 --> 46:48.380]  with nice, safe railings than you are
[46:48.380 --> 46:49.880]  on a catwalk without railings
[46:49.880 --> 46:52.740]  and that was saving websites directly to production.
[46:52.740 --> 46:55.580]  I still edit things, some things on Daring Fireball
[46:55.580 --> 46:59.580]  directly on the website and it keeps you sharp.
[46:59.580 --> 47:00.680]  Yep.
[47:00.680 --> 47:01.520]  You know, it's interesting though
[47:01.520 --> 47:05.860]  because I still feel like, I don't know,
[47:05.860 --> 47:07.700]  I've been doing this for almost 25 years now
[47:07.700 --> 47:09.860]  and with Oscillate even before that,
[47:09.860 --> 47:11.380]  I still feel like when I publish something,
[47:11.380 --> 47:16.020]  sometimes I was like, why am I allowed to do this?
[47:16.020 --> 47:18.240]  I just push a button and it's out there
[47:18.240 --> 47:20.320]  and hundreds of people read it
[47:20.320 --> 47:22.800]  in the next three minutes or whatever
[47:22.800 --> 47:25.660]  because everyone's on RSS and it just seems insane
[47:25.660 --> 47:27.460]  to me sometimes, like when you actually,
[47:27.460 --> 47:28.460]  you know, it's one of those things
[47:28.460 --> 47:31.560]  where if you actually think about how things work
[47:31.560 --> 47:33.880]  in the world, you're like, oh my God,
[47:33.880 --> 47:35.740]  I can't believe how this works
[47:35.740 --> 47:37.060]  and this is one of those things.
[47:37.060 --> 47:39.300]  It seems insane to me that I can push a button
[47:39.300 --> 47:41.120]  and all of a sudden around the world,
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.820]  everyone can read this instantly.
[47:44.100 --> 47:45.940]  I totally agree.
[47:45.940 --> 47:47.940]  Who else was an inspiration for you?
[47:47.940 --> 47:52.940]  Dave Weiner is obvious and helped formulate
[47:53.300 --> 47:57.980]  the top-down chronological nature of blogging
[47:57.980 --> 47:59.540]  in the mid-90s.
[47:59.540 --> 48:02.740]  He's been doing scripting.com for at least,
[48:02.740 --> 48:06.860]  I think as long as, or longer than you and it's longer,
[48:06.860 --> 48:07.700]  I think, yeah.
[48:07.700 --> 48:11.740]  Yeah, and no surprise that he invented RSS,
[48:11.740 --> 48:16.220]  which is by nature, I think best suited
[48:16.220 --> 48:18.620]  to be consumed chronologically.
[48:18.620 --> 48:21.060]  I mean, you cannot, I mean, part of the beauty of RSS
[48:21.060 --> 48:23.340]  is if you wanted to, you could somehow do something
[48:23.340 --> 48:25.340]  with it that's not, but it, you know,
[48:25.340 --> 48:29.960]  RSS in a sense is just a chronological,
[48:29.960 --> 48:33.060]  it's the blogging format in a more,
[48:33.060 --> 48:34.260]  in a structured.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.040]  Yeah, exactly.
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.360]  Non-visual data stream format.
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.820]  And so it's no surprise that he invented that.
[48:41.820 --> 48:42.940]  You mentioned robot.
[48:42.940 --> 48:44.980]  And it's interesting if you take,
[48:44.980 --> 48:46.860]  well, what were you, sorry, I was just gonna say
[48:46.860 --> 48:49.100]  like on Dave, like I'm not a regular scripting
[48:49.100 --> 48:51.020]  news reader anymore, but like I went,
[48:51.020 --> 48:54.300]  I don't know, a few weeks ago and he has still got
[48:54.300 --> 48:57.500]  like a great blogging voice.
[48:57.500 --> 48:59.060]  You know, it's kind of that combination
[48:59.060 --> 49:03.180]  between like he can write and it's also like very casual.
[49:03.180 --> 49:05.020]  You know, I mean, all writing is casual now
[49:05.020 --> 49:07.020]  or most writing is casual, you know,
[49:07.020 --> 49:08.940]  like Twitter has sort of trained everybody
[49:08.940 --> 49:10.980]  to be this sort of very casual,
[49:10.980 --> 49:14.040]  but his voice is still great.
[49:14.040 --> 49:16.840]  You can hear it, I can hear it.
[49:16.840 --> 49:18.520]  Yeah, and it's funny because he came to it,
[49:18.520 --> 49:21.320]  he used to write, what I should do is get him on the show
[49:21.320 --> 49:22.640]  and I've long been thinking about it,
[49:22.640 --> 49:26.400]  but much like Oscillate, he had written
[49:26.400 --> 49:30.220]  before scripting.com and sort of overlapping with it
[49:30.220 --> 49:33.720]  these columns called DaveNet for Hotwire.
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.200]  And they were more like traditional columns,
[49:37.200 --> 49:40.440]  like a DaveNet was like a whole article
[49:40.440 --> 49:45.440]  and it wasn't a blog, but he was full of hyperlinks
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.240]  and it was super exuberant about the open web
[49:50.240 --> 49:55.240]  and full of ideas, but it's like he went on that same path
[49:55.320 --> 49:59.640]  where it's like he intuitively knew that writing
[49:59.640 --> 50:04.640]  like a once or twice a week column wasn't for him
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.600]  and it wasn't what he was meant to do.
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.600]  But the scripting.com, also nobody else
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.400]  has ever blogged like Dave Weiner,
[50:17.400 --> 50:22.400]  except the people who've used his blogging engine tools
[50:23.240 --> 50:26.920]  or CMSs, which were always meant to publish
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.000]  a Dave Weiner-style blog, but nobody else
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  has his unique sense of timing and length of items
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.880]  in a way scripting.com remains the oldest school
[50:40.880 --> 50:44.800]  of old school blogs because his entries
[50:44.800 --> 50:48.760]  are mostly still just paragraphs.
[50:48.760 --> 50:52.640]  They're not headline plus paragraph
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.120]  and he's ranted about it on and off for years
[50:57.120 --> 50:59.900]  and he's right because he invented RSS,
[50:59.900 --> 51:04.900]  but huge frustration for him are RSS readers
[51:04.900 --> 51:09.260]  that assume every entry has a title or a headline
[51:09.260 --> 51:10.740]  or whatever you wanna call it.
[51:10.740 --> 51:15.740]  And he invented RSS knowing his own style
[51:16.100 --> 51:18.140]  and knowing that whatever the element,
[51:18.140 --> 51:20.720]  I forget if it's, I think it's title,
[51:20.720 --> 51:22.860]  it's like inside the entry item,
[51:22.860 --> 51:25.140]  or maybe it's inside a thing called item
[51:25.140 --> 51:27.980]  is a thing called title, and it's marked optional
[51:27.980 --> 51:31.040]  very, very, very obviously in this spec,
[51:31.040 --> 51:33.600]  but it's a very old school style,
[51:33.600 --> 51:35.880]  which you used to have too, right?
[51:35.880 --> 51:38.080]  Like in the early days of Cutkey,
[51:38.080 --> 51:41.740]  posts were paragraphs, not headline,
[51:41.740 --> 51:44.540]  not articles or items or whatever you wanna call them.
[51:45.580 --> 51:49.020]  Yeah, the reason why I started doing headlines
[51:49.020 --> 51:50.260]  is because of RSS.
[51:50.260 --> 51:52.980]  Otherwise I don't necessarily think I would have.
[51:52.980 --> 51:56.120]  And I mean, I side with Dave on this.
[51:56.120 --> 51:58.620]  If it were better for RSS and that sort of stuff,
[51:58.620 --> 52:01.980]  like I would use a lot fewer titles.
[52:01.980 --> 52:05.980]  And with the quick links now, that's what that is again.
[52:05.980 --> 52:10.340]  It's sort of a return to these titleless posts.
[52:11.460 --> 52:13.140]  And the reason I started doing those
[52:13.140 --> 52:15.300]  is because it works well on Twitter
[52:15.300 --> 52:18.060]  and Mastodon and Facebook and stuff.
[52:18.060 --> 52:20.380]  It's a little nugget with one link
[52:20.380 --> 52:22.500]  that you can send across social media,
[52:22.500 --> 52:24.340]  sort of the same way.
[52:25.700 --> 52:28.840]  I was about to say that the odd thing about it
[52:28.840 --> 52:33.140]  in the way that like, I think it's a truism
[52:33.140 --> 52:34.620]  for all of humanity.
[52:34.620 --> 52:36.780]  I mean, not just our modern age,
[52:36.780 --> 52:40.020]  but go back as far into history as we can,
[52:40.020 --> 52:43.140]  that good ideas resurface.
[52:43.140 --> 52:48.140]  And sometimes good ideas don't strike, right?
[52:48.660 --> 52:50.900]  It's somehow the matchbook got wet
[52:50.900 --> 52:54.180]  and it could have, but something happened.
[52:54.180 --> 52:56.660]  The match just isn't gonna strike.
[52:56.660 --> 52:58.620]  It's going to resurface.
[52:58.620 --> 53:03.100]  And titleless blog posts never really stuck.
[53:03.100 --> 53:05.540]  Dave has stuck with them, but for the most part,
[53:05.540 --> 53:08.580]  almost nobody else does it anymore.
[53:08.580 --> 53:13.580]  But what are tweets other than short titleless blog posts?
[53:17.020 --> 53:19.900]  The idea resurfaced and it's become
[53:21.860 --> 53:25.440]  another one of those media or forms,
[53:25.440 --> 53:27.340]  whatever you want to call it,
[53:27.340 --> 53:29.820]  that's now so established that people forget
[53:29.820 --> 53:31.140]  it had to be invented.
[53:31.140 --> 53:32.980]  But that's all that tweets are.
[53:32.980 --> 53:36.860]  And with Mastodon and it's variable
[53:36.860 --> 53:38.360]  character length limits, right?
[53:38.360 --> 53:42.740]  Like I think the standard out of the box limit
[53:42.740 --> 53:44.860]  is 500 characters.
[53:44.860 --> 53:46.860]  It might be something else.
[53:46.860 --> 53:47.780]  Something like that.
[53:47.780 --> 53:50.020]  But because it's open source software
[53:50.020 --> 53:51.400]  and it's part of the,
[53:51.400 --> 53:56.400]  some instances of Mastodon have different character limits,
[53:57.640 --> 54:02.640]  but that's only enforced on the post from that server.
[54:04.040 --> 54:07.160]  But let's just say, but for the sake of argument
[54:07.160 --> 54:11.960]  and putting the pedantry side, 500 characters.
[54:11.960 --> 54:13.320]  No title, right?
[54:13.320 --> 54:15.920]  It's just a 500 character blob of text
[54:15.920 --> 54:18.520]  that could be and generally often is,
[54:18.520 --> 54:22.880]  I would bet the average Mastodon post is still,
[54:22.880 --> 54:24.660]  or at least the people I follow,
[54:24.660 --> 54:28.000]  is within Twitter's 280 characters, right?
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.400]  It's just a thought.
[54:30.400 --> 54:33.600]  It's like the length of one thought, no title.
[54:35.320 --> 54:37.200]  You could do a whole,
[54:37.200 --> 54:42.140]  I think you could do a whole 40 minute presentation
[54:42.140 --> 54:45.820]  at a conference on the psychology
[54:45.820 --> 54:50.040]  of not having to create a title for a post.
[54:51.040 --> 54:53.800]  Because it seems you would think at first
[54:53.800 --> 54:56.920]  and most people and maybe people who don't tweet a lot
[54:56.920 --> 55:00.480]  or aren't writers and are just readers and consumers
[55:00.480 --> 55:02.580]  would think, well, that doesn't seem difficult.
[55:02.580 --> 55:04.840]  And most of the things you read
[55:04.840 --> 55:07.600]  have maybe seemingly obvious titles
[55:07.600 --> 55:09.320]  that are just sort of descriptive
[55:09.320 --> 55:13.520]  and maybe certain written to help you understand it.
[55:13.520 --> 55:14.920]  So isn't that obvious?
[55:14.920 --> 55:18.680]  But it is like an, I don't know how to describe it,
[55:18.680 --> 55:22.320]  but it is psychologically as a someone
[55:22.320 --> 55:24.720]  who writes such things, it is a huge,
[55:24.720 --> 55:26.440]  if I had to have titles for tweets,
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.720]  I would have tweeted and I would continue Mastodon posting
[55:31.560 --> 55:34.400]  1 10th, 1 50th, I don't know.
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.720]  I don't know that I would have ever even,
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.360]  I don't know that, I don't think the thing ever
[55:38.360 --> 55:39.180]  would have taken off.
[55:39.180 --> 55:42.320]  I don't think it ever would have gotten off the ground.
[55:42.320 --> 55:45.480]  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting the titles thing,
[55:45.480 --> 55:48.320]  because so you've got what you've written.
[55:48.320 --> 55:52.480]  So the way that I do it is I've got what I've written
[55:52.480 --> 55:54.760]  and then you somehow in the title
[55:54.760 --> 55:56.820]  also have to say what you've written,
[55:56.820 --> 55:59.840]  but you don't want to necessarily say it again
[55:59.840 --> 56:04.600]  in the same way as you did in the text of the thing.
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.760]  And then I also have to,
[56:06.760 --> 56:11.160]  so each of my main posts also has some like tweet text
[56:11.160 --> 56:13.880]  and that's the text that goes out like on social media.
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.160]  So I have to rewrite what I wrote
[56:17.160 --> 56:19.120]  in the title and in the piece.
[56:19.120 --> 56:22.880]  I also have to do it in less than 250 characters
[56:22.880 --> 56:24.320]  or whatever it is with the link.
[56:24.320 --> 56:25.800]  So it's like, I'm writing,
[56:25.800 --> 56:28.360]  I'm trying to write the same thing three times
[56:28.360 --> 56:31.400]  with three different content links.
[56:31.400 --> 56:34.800]  And it's sometimes it is like the last thing
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.640]  that I want to do.
[56:35.640 --> 56:36.700]  I'm like, fuck this.
[56:36.700 --> 56:39.160]  I just want to write the thing that I want to write
[56:39.160 --> 56:41.520]  and then move on and I don't want to have to think
[56:41.520 --> 56:42.680]  about the stupid title.
[56:44.680 --> 56:47.080]  It's possible we might be heading towards
[56:47.080 --> 56:50.400]  by the time you and I finish up this racket,
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.760]  we might be heading towards a time
[56:51.760 --> 56:52.960]  where you could just do that
[56:52.960 --> 56:55.680]  and some kind of open AI type thing
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.000]  could do the summary for you, the tweet length summary.
[56:59.000 --> 56:59.840]  Oh, there you go.
[56:59.840 --> 57:01.400]  I mean, cause that's the sort of thing
[57:01.400 --> 57:04.160]  that these goddamn bots are good at, right?
[57:04.160 --> 57:08.560]  Doing the, using them to produce summaries is shocking.
[57:08.560 --> 57:10.960]  I don't want to go on a side rant about what's,
[57:10.960 --> 57:14.640]  what's impressive and surprising about these open AIs,
[57:14.640 --> 57:17.440]  but their ability to summarize is incredible.
[57:17.440 --> 57:19.240]  Have you looked at any of these AI things
[57:19.240 --> 57:21.480]  and put your stuff in there and see what it makes of it?
[57:21.480 --> 57:22.880]  Hey, I'm going to give you this post.
[57:22.880 --> 57:24.440]  Can you summarize it?
[57:24.440 --> 57:25.600]  No, I haven't really.
[57:25.600 --> 57:26.800]  Cause I'm a little, I'm a little.
[57:26.800 --> 57:28.120]  Yeah, I haven't, I haven't done it either.
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.280]  No, I've asked them what they think of me.
[57:32.880 --> 57:34.240]  What, what, what did they?
[57:34.240 --> 57:36.640]  Oh, it's super boring.
[57:36.640 --> 57:38.520]  They just steal from Wikipedia
[57:38.520 --> 57:40.520]  and say that I'm a writer, blogger.
[57:40.520 --> 57:41.760]  Actually, they're a little better.
[57:41.760 --> 57:44.880]  Actually, I think that the Bing chat bot has a better,
[57:44.880 --> 57:49.880]  in my opinion, a better brief two, three sentence bio
[57:50.080 --> 57:53.560]  of me than Wikipedia does in my, I forget the difference,
[57:53.560 --> 57:57.480]  but it seems to me to fit more my mental model
[57:57.480 --> 57:59.760]  of what I should be known for.
[57:59.760 --> 58:02.480]  But I, what I miss the boat on the thing
[58:02.480 --> 58:06.720]  where the Bing one could be tricked into revealing
[58:06.720 --> 58:08.560]  the Sydney character behind the scenes.
[58:08.560 --> 58:11.160]  I really am so mad that I missed the boat.
[58:11.160 --> 58:13.440]  It was like, there was like this two day window
[58:13.440 --> 58:16.400]  and Kevin Roos of the New York Times, you know,
[58:16.400 --> 58:21.200]  that he's the guy who Sydney said he should leave his wife.
[58:22.240 --> 58:23.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[58:23.080 --> 58:24.680]  And start a relationship with her.
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.400]  Ben Thompson got into an argument with Sydney
[58:28.400 --> 58:32.760]  and she told him he was a bad researcher
[58:32.760 --> 58:35.400]  and that she was gonna report him to her developers
[58:35.400 --> 58:37.160]  and get him kicked off the service.
[58:38.120 --> 58:38.960]  Wow, right.
[58:38.960 --> 58:39.880]  Hard truth there.
[58:39.880 --> 58:43.200]  I missed the boat on that, but no, with my tweets,
[58:43.200 --> 58:45.200]  I have to rewrite and it's overdue.
[58:45.200 --> 58:47.880]  And again, I'm a chronic procrastinator.
[58:47.880 --> 58:49.780]  I mean, just take a look at Daring Fireball.
[58:49.780 --> 58:52.720]  I hand wrote my own tweet bot, not tweet bot the app,
[58:52.720 --> 58:56.000]  but my bot that tweets my articles.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.920]  It runs on a cron task on my server, reads my RSS feed
[58:59.920 --> 59:02.280]  and waits, this is part of the cleverness
[59:02.280 --> 59:03.780]  because I hand wrote it.
[59:03.780 --> 59:07.040]  It waits until they're at least five minutes old
[59:07.040 --> 59:08.440]  before it will auto tweet them.
[59:08.440 --> 59:12.800]  So if it happens, if the cron task happens to be up,
[59:12.800 --> 59:16.940]  the five minute interval is up right after I publish,
[59:16.940 --> 59:20.600]  it won't tweet it because it gives me five minutes
[59:20.600 --> 59:24.920]  to quick fix any obvious typos
[59:24.920 --> 59:29.200]  or if I accidentally publish before I actually meant to
[59:29.200 --> 59:30.080]  or something like that.
[59:30.080 --> 59:31.980]  So it runs every five minutes,
[59:31.980 --> 59:36.980]  but all mine does is tweet the headline and then the URL.
[59:37.720 --> 59:42.080]  And the other reason that I wrote my own
[59:42.080 --> 59:44.440]  and it's way less important now
[59:44.440 --> 59:47.000]  that Twitter has 280 characters,
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.800]  but some of my headlines, it's like a shtick,
[59:49.800 --> 59:51.480]  as I'm sure you've noticed.
[59:51.480 --> 59:54.720]  It's like once or twice a year,
[59:54.720 --> 59:59.720]  I will write a multi 100 character headline.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.120]  And along the lines inspired by our mutual hero,
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.480]  David Foster Wallace and that sort of,
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.760]  I don't know what you would even call it,
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.040]  a shtick for lack of a better word.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.680]  I'm sure he'd have a better word for it,
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.340]  but there are many, not many,
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.520]  but numerous posts in Daring Fireball's history
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.840]  that the combination of headline plus URL,
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.360]  even a shortened URL would not fit in 140 characters.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:29.480]  And I wanted to write my own algorithm
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.720]  to truncate the headline.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.200]  So of course I wrote my own thing.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.760]  I have to update it from Mastodon.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.800]  I've been putting that off.
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.000]  That won't take much longer.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.320]  But all I do is the headline.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.320]  But I have noticed that yours are handcrafted summaries.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.100]  And I was curious, I actually was curious about it.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.320]  So that's like, what is that?
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.620]  Another field in movable type or?
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.840]  Yeah, exactly, so I just use another field.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:57.440]  And then I have a custom tweet thing that I wrote
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.000]  that pushes it out to Twitter.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  And then actually I have a Zapier or Zapier
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.960]  that reads the tweet and then posts it to Facebook
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.520]  because the Facebook API stuff is a little bit like,
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.400]  I don't know, I just didn't want to go there.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.720]  And then I recently updated it for Mastodon.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.080]  So it's doing the same thing there.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.760]  And the reason I did it is that I just didn't want
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.640]  to use the title because I felt like the titles
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.600]  really didn't do that well on Twitter.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.320]  It wasn't enticing people to click through.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.160]  I wanted a little bit more explanation
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.840]  and I wanted to show a little bit more
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.960]  of what you're actually getting yourself into
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.080]  if you want to click on the link.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.240]  And I don't know, I just think they work a little bit better
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.400]  than just titles.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.960]  It's worth sort of the extra effort.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.960]  They come across as the way someone would hand tweet a link
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.680]  or that you would hand tweet a link to the thing.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.900]  Yep.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.240]  All right, I'm gonna keep going on this front about Kraft,
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.580]  but let me take another break here
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.700]  and thank our next sponsor.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.200]  It's our good friends at Kolide, K-O-L-I-D-E.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.240]  Kolide has some big news.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.480]  If you're an Okta user, they can get your entire fleet
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.080]  to 100% compliance.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.140]  How?
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.240]  Well, if a device isn't compliant,
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.400]  the user can't log into your cloud apps
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.540]  until they've fixed the problem.
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.640]  It's that simple.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.000]  Kolide patches one of the major holes
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.400]  in zero trust architecture, device compliance.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.480]  Without Kolide, IT struggles to solve basic problems
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.400]  like keeping everyone's OS and browser up to date,
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.220]  unsecured devices are logging into your company's apps
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.360]  because there's nothing there to stop them.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.620]  Kolide is the only device trust solution
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:49.800]  that enforces compliance as part of authentication
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.120]  and it's built to work seamlessly with Okta.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.600]  The moment Kolide's agent detects a problem,
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.360]  it alerts the user and gives them instructions to fix it.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.440]  If they don't fix the problem within a set time,
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.500]  they're blocked.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.760]  That's it.
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.920]  Kolide's method means fewer support tickets,
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.880]  less frustration, and more importantly,
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.120]  100% fleet compliance.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.120]  Visit kolide.com slash the talk show to learn more
[01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.480]  or book a demo.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.480]  That's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash the talk show.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.860]  All right, I broke the seal on movable type.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.960]  My joke for this episode was that I've collected
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.200]  and we've got here in a group chat
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.600]  the entire world user base of the movable type CMS
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.140]  all on one podcast.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.920]  Yeah, we're all here.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.680]  I'm not sure that that's entirely true.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.000]  Off the top of my head, I can't think of any friends
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.400]  who are still using it.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.980]  I think kodol.com still runs it,
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:55.600]  but they don't really update the blog part
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.000]  of kodol.com anymore.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.160]  They're really more focused.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.080]  Yeah, they don't.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.960]  They're more focused on field notes
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.920]  and I don't think the field notes stuff,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.480]  I don't think that runs on movable type.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.160]  I could check with Jim, but just about everybody.
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.080]  What, six colors used to, but not anymore?
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.600]  You know, I actually, this comes up with Jason Snell.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.000]  Six colors definitely moved to WordPress,
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.880]  but I believe that Jason's,
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.560]  the incomparable podcast empire
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.840]  might still run on movable type.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.640]  And in fact, I'm almost certain, I think so.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.520]  Anyway, so he's got something still going with it.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.840]  Our mutual friend, Greg Canouse, is that how you,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.500]  I honest to God don't know how to pronounce
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.620]  his fucking surname.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.360]  I think it's Greg Nouse, just Nouse.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.340]  Well, it's Canouse when you spell it.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.180]  It is.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.080]  But he is, he's actually a friend
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.240]  and I don't know how to pronounce his goddamn surname.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.880]  I guess I, or I continually forget.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.060]  I see, my problem, A, I always say this.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.160]  My problem is A, when I became a voracious reader
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.340]  as a youth, I didn't wanna ask my parents
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:02.260]  how to pronounce words.
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.800]  And so when I'd encounter a new word,
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.640]  I'd pronounce it in my head.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.920]  And my brain was jelly back then,
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.480]  but my brain is now cement
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.080]  and all of those, how I guessed as a child
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.140]  to pronounce certain words are cemented in my head.
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:21.140]  And B, I also, for anything I need to learn how to spell,
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.720]  I somehow in my mind memorize a phonetic spelling.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.160]  And that's why, of course his name isn't pronounced Canouse.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.200]  Of course not, right?
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.600]  Although Gary Gnu was Gary Gnu.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.600]  No, Gnu's is good Gnu's with Gary.
[01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.280]  I love that we're talking about,
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.780]  what is it, the Great Space Coaster?
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:42.620]  Yeah, the Great Space Coaster.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.900]  Is that the name of the show?
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.740]  Gary Gnu.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.560]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.680]  Yeah, a prototypical.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.080]  Gary the, yeah.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.920]  Prototypical.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.160]  Gary Gnu with the Gnus.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.120]  Yeah, prototypical YouTuber.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.120]  You can just.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.720]  Pretty much.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.400]  Oh, it was sort of like weekend update for kids, really.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.240]  I guess is a better one.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.200]  Yeah, in my head, and of course his name
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.920]  isn't pronounced Canouse, but it's,
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.180]  in my head it's Canouse,
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.440]  because that way I know how to spell it.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.600]  But anyway, he's still a movable type expert,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.640]  or I'll just ask why,
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.400]  because people ask me all the time.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.080]  I mean, at this point,
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.220]  I've kind of bolted so many things onto it
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.400]  that changing would not only mean
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.920]  changing sort of like regular CMS things,
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.720]  but also all sorts of different other things.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.640]  I took earlier, actually last year,
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.200]  I took a couple of really hard looks at Ghost
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.880]  to figure out if I could make that thing
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.700]  do what I wanted it to.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.480]  And it's there in a lot of ways.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.120]  And I think in some ways it's just,
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.720]  Ghost is something like Substack or whatever,
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.660]  it's built around,
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.160]  it's sort of built around like longer articles with titles.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.040]  That seems to be the direction that we're heading in.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:00.560]  Like we're, it's almost come full circle in that,
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.800]  before blogs, everyone wrote things with articles
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.720]  with titles or whatever.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.200]  And now it's like we're back there
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.240]  with the newsletter thing.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.800]  You have three articles that come out every week
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.000]  and that's the deal.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.240]  But that's not where I want to move to.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.760]  Like I want to move, if anything,
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.080]  I want to move back more towards more of a Twitter vibe
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.480]  than a Substack vibe, you know what I mean?
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.120]  Just like on my personal end.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.040]  And I just don't think Ghost,
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.240]  I think you can probably do it
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.960]  because it's extensible and open source
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.880]  and all that sort of stuff.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.960]  And you can write all of this stuff around it,
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.720]  but a lot of my stuff is in Perl and PHP still,
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.720]  because I'm stuck in the Amber of the early 2000s,
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.040]  technologically speaking.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:51.840]  A lot of your stuff or all of your stuff or all of your stuff?
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.440]  I would say probably all of it.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.480]  There's some JavaScript stuff going on,
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.640]  but not a ton of it, yeah.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.640]  The only thing I have that's not written in PHP or Perl,
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.500]  and I'm in the exact same situation with you
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.720]  and I've often described my movable type setup
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.200]  as my analogy is Han Solo's description
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.400]  of the Millennium Falcon that I've made.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.120]  She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.120]  I forget the exact quote, but the key part is
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.040]  I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.040]  Exactly.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.040]  And combining with the fact that Han Solo
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:32.280]  doesn't seem exactly like the sharpest mechanic
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.300]  in the galaxy.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.680]  And this shit keeps breaking down.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.980]  And it isn't exactly a bulletproof architecture,
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.060]  but it's really cool shit, right?
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.620]  Like the stupid little gun that can come out
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:48.440]  and shoot some stormtroopers if they come out
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.440]  before you take off.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.800]  That's my movable type.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.580]  My movable type and my publishing system
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.260]  doesn't resemble the out of the box movable,
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.160]  and never did.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.240]  I mean, from day one, didn't really resemble
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.120]  out of the box movable type.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:06.200]  It's, to me, it's a static website.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.960]  It's not a publisher and the public
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.080]  never touches movable type.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:16.080]  It was a static web generator before that was even a term.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.980]  And if it's not broke, don't fix it part.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.960]  There's the I know Pearl, and Pearl,
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.080]  I wouldn't recommend it.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.840]  I've never been a Pearl evangelist,
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.880]  but the way my brain works as a programmer,
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.640]  it's the language that best suits
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.280]  the wavelengths of my brain.
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  And PHP is just stupid Pearl, in my opinion.
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.640]  You know what, let me take that back.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:45.600]  Well, let me put that back.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.440]  Let me take that back.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.120]  Because I know that PHP has continued to evolve
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.880]  and there's modern PHP with all of this
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.880]  object-oriented stuff and the language has evolved,
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.880]  but the original PHP was even advertised as stupid Pearl.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.080]  And that's why there's dollar signs
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.860]  in front of the variables and stuff like that.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:10.000]  So the way I write PHP is just,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.560]  I write it almost like Pearl
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.800]  and then just keep banging my head
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.540]  against the way that, oh, this would be easy in Pearl,
[01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.160]  but to put a regular expression in PHP,
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.160]  it has to be in a string,
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.560]  and so I've gotta backslash, escape, blah, blah, blah.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560]  The only thing I've done that's not PHP or Pearl
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.900]  is way back when custom link shorteners were a thing.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.000]  I didn't wanna use Bitly because, of course,
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  I wanted to do it myself and I wrote my own link shortener.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.920]  And I even had a fancy domain name with the star in it.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.920]  It was DF and then the Unicode symbol for a star dot US.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.140]  Which I thought-
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:47.960]  I remember that.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.480]  And I thought that was the fucking shit.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.120]  I was like, damn, that is sweet.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.120]  DF and then a Unicode star dot US.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.260]  Well, guess what?
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:04.700]  It broke in just about everybody else's CMSs.
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.700]  It was all over the place.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.720]  And oh, and the other thing it really broke were this,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.040]  I remember why it changed.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.520]  The biggest reason it broke wasn't CMSs,
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.160]  it was link detectors.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.560]  So in other words,
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.440]  anything where you paste a URL into plain text
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.680]  and it automatically linkifies the link.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.120]  And most URLs are easy to determine.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.160]  Almost all of them broke
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.280]  because that star character didn't look like a character
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.840]  and everybody was using regular expressions
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.320]  and their regular expressions broke.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.200]  And I would go to people,
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.440]  because my weird, bizarre, super talent in programming
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.920]  is creating regular expressions.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.960]  I have a gist that is like one of the most popular
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:54.960]  just out there of a liberal, just a regular expression,
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.800]  but it's like this huge, crazy long regular expression
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.880]  to match URLs.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.000]  And it's pretty good.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:00.960]  There's better ways now.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.640]  And in fact, mine has some bugs
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.200]  where you can put a bad URL at it
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.040]  and it'll get caught in an infinite loop
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.980]  in some like Python or something like that.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.360]  But anyway, I would send people a better URL
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.580]  that would help match the star, but it didn't help.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.040]  And I was like, all right, I give up.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.000]  And I, but I couldn't find a good,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.420]  so my, the one I, the long-term domain I settled on
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.420]  was df4.us, because I couldn't get something better.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.820]  Or no, my ones with the fancy Unicode weren't.us,
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.480]  they were.ws, which I don't even know what that stands for,
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.960]  but it was one of the few top,
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.180]  it was, but the reason I went with.ws
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.040]  was A, it was two characters,
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.900]  and B, it was one of the few top-level domains
[01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.240]  that would accept a Unicode character
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.400]  in the string of the domain itself.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.160]  Most wouldn't, like you couldn't register dfstar.com.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.040]  You just, the.com wouldn't accept it
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.300]  for the good reason that it doesn't really work.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:02.060]  So I, but anyway, I wrote my custom link unshortener
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:06.600]  in Sinatra, which is Ruby, and it, it's, it,
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.360]  oh, it's, and I taught myself Ruby just,
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.400]  because I, at the time, and I guess, I don't know,
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.200]  what was this, like 2008, nine, my brain was just
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.960]  quite not cement enough that I could,
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.040]  I felt like I could learn a new language.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.080]  And so I wrote the whole thing myself in Sinatra with Ruby,
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.800]  and I was like, hey, I could tell that this is joyful,
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.440]  I can see why people love this Ruby language,
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.120]  this is a lot of fun, and then I wrote it,
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.120]  and then I fixed the bugs, and then I've left it running.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.820]  I literally, I haven't restarted or touched that.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.540]  It runs on a different server, of course,
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.800]  because it has to answer the df4.us domain.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.040]  Sinatra's awesome, because it just runs and runs and runs,
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.260]  and you never have to kick it, kick the tires,
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.920]  or do anything, but I've completely forgotten
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.440]  everything about how it works.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.120]  I don't even know, I don't know, I've completely forgotten
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.360]  everything about Ruby, I've completely forgotten
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  how you actually make Sinatra work,
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.960]  so if it ever does break, I don't even know
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:02.880]  if I know how to restart it.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.180]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.120]  And in hindsight.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.660]  Do you even know, like, the login?
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.560]  Oh, I do, I should check.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.040]  I'm actually, one thing I'm good at pack routing
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.440]  are passwords, so I'm pretty sure I've got the login,
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.680]  but it's not gonna work.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.160]  But anyway, I'm in the same boat.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.080]  I've looked at other things.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.920]  Matt Mullenweg, you know Matt, right?
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.760]  I mean, you've got to.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.320]  One of the great mentions of the entire world,
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.640]  one of the best people I've ever met,
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.120]  creator of WordPress, which he forked from something else,
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120]  which he'd be the first person to admit,
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.500]  and CEO of the whole WordPress slash Tumblr
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.880]  slash whatever else they've got under their umbrella.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.900]  I'm sure, I bet they still have it going.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:47.560]  I don't know, like six, seven, eight years ago,
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:52.560]  he and me and Om Malik went to a Yankees playoff game,
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:57.100]  and Matt told me at this game, it was just the three of us,
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:01.280]  that he'd had a team build a clone of Daring Fireball
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:05.300]  at WordPress in WordPress that looks just like
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.040]  Daring Fireball, and just uses the RSS feed
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.560]  to keep it populated.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.180]  And he's like, any time you want to switch over,
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.320]  just say the word.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.980]  And I'm like, that's very nice of you.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.520]  But my problem with that is, I don't, I would never,
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.840]  I don't like, it's not that I don't like WordPress,
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.820]  it's just that I know that I would never figure out
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:24.000]  how it works under the hood.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.560]  It's very, very complex.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.000]  I've looked at it, and I wouldn't,
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  therefore I wouldn't be able to do my own weird things,
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.200]  my special modifications.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.360]  Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:36.200]  And the other-
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.280]  The way I always describe my site is,
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.240]  it's held together by bailing wire,
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.240]  but it's so, the fact that it's like a flat file generator,
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.040]  and you can generate any type of flat file you want,
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.180]  including PHP, so you can generate files
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.120]  that are gonna then do other things.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.080]  It's just, it's so, it's so flexible,
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.600]  and so, once you get your brain around it,
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.040]  which is, my brain has been around it for years and years
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:07.880]  now, it is just, it's so powerful.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.720]  That's exactly how Daring Fireball works.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.100]  It's, I go through movable type, which is written in Perl,
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:18.960]  and I publish, and it spits out PHP files,
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.000]  and those PHP files, based on a template,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.440]  have, I mostly use PHP as like a fancy server side include,
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.560]  and they just include things like the sidebar,
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.760]  and the thing at the top.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.560]  And so, if I wanna make a change,
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:37.600]  like if I want to add, which I will do soon,
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.600]  once I get my bot updated, a Mastodon link in my sidebar,
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.060]  in addition to, or perhaps replacing the Twitter link,
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.300]  I'll just update one file, which is my sidebar,
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.380]  and all, it'll instantly appear on all my pages.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.280]  I don't have to do the movable type republish thing,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:57.020]  which is like the was, was back in the day,
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.440]  the big knock against it.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.920]  Because everything that could be a server side include
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.700]  is just a server side include that I do in PHP,
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.560]  and then I have a little bit of other stuff
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:08.160]  that I do in PHP that to make things dynamic,
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.400]  or something like that.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.040]  But yeah, and it's, the whole world's moved on,
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:16.320]  and I don't know what web's, the Node.js thing does,
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.240]  I don't understand it, I really don't.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.840]  I don't understand how it works.
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:20.960]  I don't, I don't get it.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.080]  I don't understand the concept.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.320]  Yeah, no, I'm, same.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.520]  Whereas Apache.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.120]  And I think that's what.
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.600]  I totally understand.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.440]  I think that's what Ghost is written in, right?
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.280]  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.120]  So like when I was looking at Ghost, I was like,
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.120]  okay, so I'm gonna have to learn Node.js,
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.480]  like how it works, you know, like it works in the browser,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.140]  but it's also like on the backend,
[01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.520]  and yeah, I was just like, okay, this is a lot for me,
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.080]  I think, you know, brain stuck in cement.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.080]  Right, so as a thing that just spits out flat text files,
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.080]  right, and movable type therefore,
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:54.920]  and you can have it emit as many for a post
[01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.120]  as many flat text files behind the scenes as you want.
[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.640]  So I've always had this trick
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.760]  where it spits out a.php file,
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.080]  but nobody ever sees those.php URLs.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.220]  I use Apache trickery so that it looks like
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:11.640]  that's not there.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.640]  But you can add.txt,.txt to any Daring Fireball URL,
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.920]  and you can see it in markdown format,
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.300]  which is plain text.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.760]  That's not done dynamically.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.680]  So every time I publish any article,
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.680]  it spits out whatever the slug.php
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.440]  and whatever the slug.txt,
[01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.400]  the.php files get served without any extension,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.280]  and if you try using the extension,
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.480]  it'll just redirect you to the URL without that.php,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.760]  and the.txt just gets served as text slash plain,
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.200]  or is it plain.txt?
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.120]  I think it's text slash plain as the content type,
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.960]  and it is a template, though,
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.960]  so it's not just the dump of the markdown format.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.920]  There's a little bit of formatting,
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.340]  and I've got my name in there,
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.380]  and the headline has the exact right number
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:13.880]  of equal signs underlining it to make a markdown H1,
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.400]  which of course I did with a fancy regular expression.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.600]  But basically, I just use movable type
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.460]  as a front end to spitting out text files,
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.360]  and it remains, that's my,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.200]  when people are like,
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.820]  how can you still be using this ancient technology?
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.680]  It works perfectly for my needs.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.680]  So there, so ends the movable type user group meetup,
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:45.640]  yeah, the meetup of every single person.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:48.360]  You know it's bad when Anil stopped using it, right?
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.200]  Or not bad, but,
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.840]  because again, I don't think it's bad.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.040]  I'm not in the least bit embarrassed that I use it,
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]  because like I said, it fits,
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.480]  and it's so funny that you and I use it the same way,
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.960]  but you know we're the last ones standing,
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:02.180]  or nearly so, when Anil switched.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.600]  Guy used to be an executive.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.860]  It's six apart.
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:09.480]  It's six apart, yeah, exactly.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.120]  Yeah, I think he's on Ghost now, maybe?
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:11.960]  I don't know. I think so.
[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.960]  I think he is, actually.
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.840]  So here we are, 25 years in.
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.880]  I'm trying to think what else there is in there.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.760]  So the one difference,
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.160]  one difference between over the decade,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.280]  can you believe it's decades,
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.400]  between me and you,
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.720]  is you've changed your design from time to time,
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.600]  and I, not so much.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.560]  But it does seem like you change it less frequently.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.960]  I mean, I think that's pretty clear.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.040]  I think, you know, and I looked back when you,
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.080]  I mentioned previously on the show,
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:46.120]  your 10th anniversary post,
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.520]  and your 10th anniversary post,
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.360]  I swear to God I've got it noted here,
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.840]  it's gonna be in the show notes,
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:55.840]  is great both to hear your thoughts a mere 10 years in,
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.680]  and because what you did in that 10 year anniversary post
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:04.400]  was collect, screenshot, and post screenshots
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.400]  of all of the designs of kotge.org theretofore.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.800]  And there, you know, and there were all over the place,
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.360]  right, it's not, you know.
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.160]  So I'm curious to hear your thoughts about that.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.000]  And, you know, the fact that you did change it so wildly
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.100]  in the early years,
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:23.840]  and the fact that it's seemingly slowed down to some degree.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.000]  Yeah, I think, you know,
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.080]  sort of the experimentation in the early days
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.500]  was, you know, sort of a leftover from oscillate, you know.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.880]  And one of the reasons I was,
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.960]  one of the reasons I started blogging
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.700]  was that I wanted something,
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:45.320]  like I wanted content to design around.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320]  Like the designing bit
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.960]  was the thing that I was kind of excited about.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.400]  And it was, you know,
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:54.740]  it was fun to come up with different ways to like present,
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:58.860]  you know, the, like different ways to design blogs.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.480]  And I think as time has gone on,
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.000]  like the actual blogging piece
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.960]  has gotten to be more important.
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:08.860]  This is the thing that I'm interested in doing.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.880]  This is the thing that people are here for.
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.140]  You know, I'm sure the same thing with your site.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.920]  A lot of people don't even go to the site.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.080]  They just read it through RSS.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.040]  You know, I'll hear a comment every once in a while.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.120]  It's, oh, I haven't been to your site
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.280]  in, you know, a couple of years.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.720]  I'm like, really?
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.640]  Like never clicked through?
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.220]  And now it's just like part of the flip side,
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.320]  I think of having sort of a bailing wire situation
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.760]  on the backend with movable type
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.860]  is that it becomes more and more difficult
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:37.000]  as you bolt more and more things onto it
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.960]  to like redesign or rework how things function.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.680]  And that's kind of where I am right now.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.800]  Like I came back, I took a sabbatical last year
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.220]  from May until, what was it?
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.360]  October, November?
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.200]  No, December, actually.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.200]  You tell me, you're the one who took the sabbatical.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.200]  I can't even remember.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.040]  It's like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind here.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:58.880]  It's like, I've just,
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:01.520]  it's completely, completely gone from my brain.
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.700]  But you know, when I came back,
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.440]  one of the things was this like, oh, like this thing,
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.160]  how this, you know, not so much how it looks,
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.280]  but like how it functions, how it works
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.240]  is a little getting to be a little bit long in the tooth.
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.000]  And I've been a little frustrated with it since I came back.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.640]  But at the same time, it's, you know,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.640]  I don't have a lot of time outside writing the site
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.920]  and like curating stuff and doing that stuff.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.440]  And it's hard to, you know, it's hard to find the time,
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:31.240]  especially like long stretches of time
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.880]  to really dig in and knuckle down and say,
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.200]  okay, I'm gonna make these changes and do it in this way.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.240]  And it's gonna require some HP
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.840]  and it's gonna require some design,
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.400]  which I'm so far removed from being a web designer
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.640]  that like those skills are very atrophied at this point.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.780]  And it just takes a long time to get going
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:51.160]  and get into that, you know, sort of groove.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.520]  And it's hard to do that at the same time
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.800]  where you're trying to like,
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.200]  oh, I gotta find some, you know, interesting stuff today.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.360]  And I read this thing and I'm gonna write this thing
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.800]  and all that stuff.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.640]  So I would very much to switch up more or less wholesale
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.640]  how the site looks and works,
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.720]  but like limited time and limited energy.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.620]  And I spent a lot of time on the site
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.760]  and that's where a lot of my energy goes.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.920]  And so it's looked the same for a while,
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:18.360]  but I don't know, hopefully in the next,
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.540]  I'm not even gonna say it.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.380]  I'm not even gonna say it.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.520]  Yeah, don't say it.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.600]  Don't, I've made that, I've made that problem with,
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.000]  I've made that promise with the mobile optimized layout
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.520]  of Daring Fireball too many times to do it again.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.320]  Yeah, I know that I have terrible podcast amnesia.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.440]  I always say this.
[01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:39.040]  I will literally forget most of this conversation
[01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.280]  within an hour of us clicking stop
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.300]  and thanking each other.
[01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.000]  I forget what I say on a podcast
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.960]  as soon as I'm done recording it.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.680]  But I suspect, so it's even worse for long ago episodes.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.160]  I forget how long ago your last appearance on this show was,
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.120]  but I'm pretty sure I asked some of these questions before,
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:01.420]  but I'll say it again, because that's, you know, why not?
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.120]  I think that's what podcasting is for.
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.080]  I've noticed, I listened to Keith Olbermann's Countdown,
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.440]  which is now a weekday, week daily podcast version
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.680]  of his own show, and I love his podcast.
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.400]  I mean, I just love his take on politics,
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.320]  and it's just the right length for me running errands
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.720]  when I'm out and about.
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:23.360]  But he's got certain recurring things.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.880]  He's got a thing at the end called Stories I Promise
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.960]  Not to Tell where he gossips about his media life,
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.780]  and he's had a tumultuous career where he's been fired
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:37.780]  and come back and left ESPN and Fox Sports and MSNBC.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.600]  He did Two Stints, and he just tells these amazing
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.020]  inside stories about the executives of MSNBC.
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:48.480]  But even though his podcast is only like six months old
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.320]  or something like that, he's already repeated
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.160]  some of them multiple times.
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.200]  And it's like, ah, you can do that with a podcast.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.540]  So I'll just repeat myself.
[01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.380]  To me, still, I'm not saying you should go back,
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:04.380]  but the kotke.org of my mind is the two or three layouts
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.300]  that had the yellow at the top.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.940]  I call it yellow, I don't know, is it chartreuse?
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.400]  It was a very, but to me, it's sort of like,
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.400]  it was similar to Daring Fireball's 4A, 525A,
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.060]  slate blue, slate gray, bluish gray, whatever you want.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.740]  It's a hard color to describe.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:26.500]  And the kotke.org of my mind is of that era.
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:28.100]  And I'm not saying you should go back,
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.820]  and I know that at this, no, but I know that at this point,
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:35.060]  the current layout has lasted longer, right?
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:39.940]  If you go by length of time, the current sort of,
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.820]  and again, it's hard to describe the sort of gradient,
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:44.900]  what would you call those colors?
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.820]  They're not quite pastel, they're...
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:51.520]  Yeah, they're not like traditional rainbow colors,
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.620]  but they're not quite pastel.
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.220]  They're kind of like something in between.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:56.880]  Right, but that layout's lasted longer,
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.060]  but the kotke.org of my mind has yellow at the top.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:01.520]  And I'm not even sure which one,
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.340]  because I have genuine deep affection for all of them.
[01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.620]  And rereading that post and looking at them all,
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.300]  I'm like, oh, I remember when you switched
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.460]  to make it more compact at the top.
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:14.300]  And I remember, and every time,
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.700]  every one of those switches you made, I loved.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.620]  And when you abandoned the yellow,
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:21.500]  it was the only time I was like, aw.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.580]  And I remember thinking, and here's where I remember
[01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:27.700]  thinking, is he'll come back to that, he'll come back.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.660]  It'll be yellow again, and of course it isn't.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.140]  The other thing, and I know I mentioned this
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.860]  the last time too, but I'll mention it again,
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.060]  is that the site technically doesn't have a name.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:42.240]  It's kotke.org, our name is our address.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.280]  Right?
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.120]  Yep.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.620]  I used, and I, and I, and I think I'm repeating myself
[01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.880]  one more time, but I, because I can't help but think
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.620]  my brain would go there.
[01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:55.100]  There was a famous Philadelphia jeweler
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.820]  who advertised on TV all the time when I was a kid.
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.820]  And the sort of local TV ad that,
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.260]  because I lived in the Philly TV market,
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.020]  and they would be the, they wouldn't be like in prime time,
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.300]  they would advertise on those four in the afternoon shows,
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:13.020]  or The Price is Right, like on a snow day,
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.260]  or whenever we could, you know, we're home
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.340]  and could watch The Price is Right at 11 a.m.
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.700]  And their jingles were famous,
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.780]  the two brothers who owned it would sing songs and stuff.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:28.780]  But the name of the jeweler was Robin's Eighth and Walnut.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:31.140]  That was the name of their thing.
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.780]  And the jingle was, Robin's Eighth and Walnut,
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:35.840]  our name is our address.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.460]  And you know, it goes on from there.
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:38.940]  But that was it, over and over again.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.300]  Robin's Eighth and Walnut, our name is our address.
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.740]  Robin's Eighth and Walnut, our name is our address.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:47.940]  And I, every time I think of this aspect of kotke.org,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.980]  I instantly think Robin's Eighth and Walnut.
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.840]  Now, Robin's Eighth and Walnut is now a French bakery.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.020]  And I think they might still be in business,
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.480]  but they're only in Delaware for sales tax purposes.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.700]  But it's just Robin's now, you know,
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:06.500]  because their name can't be their address.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:08.660]  They can't be, you know, Robin's Eighth and Walnut
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:09.700]  has a bit of a ring to it.
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:14.700]  Robin's 1444 whatever highway, you know,
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.060]  obviously doesn't sound like a good address.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.460]  But maybe they're out of business, doesn't matter.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:21.220]  I wonder about the name of the site,
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:22.980]  because it is just kotke.org.
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:26.820]  I wonder if it's been like, if that's a good thing,
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.180]  or if it's been a liability in some ways.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:32.180]  I feel like in my mind, maybe it's made it harder
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:35.220]  to thinking about like, well, you know,
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.700]  maybe I should expand the site, expand what I'm doing
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:39.940]  and bring other people on.
[01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:42.100]  And you know, I have guest editors and stuff like that,
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:43.860]  but it's always sort of temporary.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.360]  I mean, I had my friend, Tim Carmody,
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.460]  he was writing a newsletter for me for a while.
[01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:49.700]  And that was, you know,
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.300]  it was under sort of the same general umbrella,
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.140]  but it had its own sort of identity and brand
[01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.440]  and stuff like that.
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.660]  You know, but it's hard to, I don't know,
[01:29:58.660 --> 01:29:59.780]  it's hard to bring someone else on
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:02.220]  when it's like the name on the masthead is mine.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.200]  Well, and I think I've thought about changing the name,
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.860]  like through the years, I've thought about it.
[01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.460]  Maybe I should just get an actual name for the website
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.700]  instead of, you know, just like kotke.org.
[01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.260]  Maybe it would, I don't know,
[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.260]  like maybe it would change the vibe a little bit
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.500]  in a way that would be more, I mean, I don't even know.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.620]  I guess this is why I didn't get that far in pursuing it.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:28.820]  I don't know what the benefit would be necessarily.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:31.280]  Now, and I think people just think of it as Kotke, right?
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.360]  In a way, you know, it's so,
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.940]  saying it doesn't have a name isn't quite right.
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.420]  It's effectively Kotke.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:41.620]  But you do say, you know, in the actual, you know,
[01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:44.580]  when you look down, it says kotke.org,
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:47.700]  a heart emoji home of fine hypertext products.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.060]  I mean, it does say kotke.org.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:53.860]  So I think technically the title is kotke.org,
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.620]  but I think in most people's minds, they would say,
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:57.080]  oh, I read it on Kotke, right?
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.660]  They're not gonna say I read it on kotke.org.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:01.900]  Home of hypertext products has,
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:04.060]  that's the one consistent thing, right?
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.620]  I don't know that it's ever not been there.
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.280]  Has that been the slogan since day one?
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.700]  Or it's certainly been the slogan
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.060]  from 20-some years, I think.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.420]  Yeah, it's been the slogan for quite a while.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.420]  It was back and forth for a while.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.980]  Like it was not on the site for, I don't know,
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.800]  for stretches of months and maybe even years here and there.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.780]  But most of the history of the site,
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:28.140]  it said home of fine hypertext products.
[01:31:28.140 --> 01:31:31.940]  And I can't remember, I don't know how early on that was,
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.360]  but I just kind of liked it when I picked it
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.420]  because it sounded kind of old-timey,
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:38.700]  but also like new as well,
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:40.580]  because it's got the word hypertext in it.
[01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:43.400]  But it's, you know, it's like I'm a dry goods store,
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.060]  but you know, online.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.340]  I often, or in fact generally, I alter it up sometimes,
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.660]  but usually when I post links to the show
[01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:54.100]  on Daring Fireball, I mean, I link to the sponsors,
[01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.300]  I say brought to you by these fine sponsors,
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.260]  which is, I both mean genuinely,
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:03.100]  I'm very proud of the sponsors that we have for the podcast
[01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.420]  and for the site, and I'm picky,
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.460]  and I really, you know, it doesn't happen often,
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:09.040]  but we really do reject some sponsors.
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.220]  And also I like the old-timey feel of it.
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:13.940]  Yeah.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:17.540]  Do you remember the dearly departed Dean Allen?
[01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:20.220]  One of his sites was Cardigan Industries.
[01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:21.220]  Yes.
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:23.560]  And I always really liked that.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:27.080]  And it had sort of like an industrial letterhead
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.540]  sort of aesthetic to go with it as well.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:34.200]  And I always just really liked, I liked that whole vibe.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.200]  Dean, I don't want to go on a side rant, you know,
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:41.100]  which I could do, and maybe should someday.
[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:45.220]  Dean's influence on what I do at Daring Fireball
[01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.660]  cannot be overstated, because Textism,
[01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.860]  Textism came out first.
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:54.960]  I mean, honestly, if you look at Textism
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.420]  circa August 2002 when I launched,
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:03.260]  if you go back to the Wayback Machine and look at,
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:06.420]  Daring Fireball's layout actually has changed.
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:09.700]  I forget, it was about two years in.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.080]  There was an actual redesign.
[01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:17.080]  It wasn't drastic, but it was redesigned once,
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:21.940]  or tweaked, you know, call it a 1.5 instead of a 2.0.
[01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:25.300]  But the 1.0 version was so, to me,
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.700]  still looks so clearly inspired by Textism, you know,
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.840]  like that it, in my mind, it bordered it on a rip-off.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.300]  And then when I, and that was one of my biggest concerns
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.000]  when I first went public and started my first post.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.800]  Like, here it comes, people are gonna say
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.900]  it's a Textism rip-off, and nobody ever said that.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.980]  And then a couple of months in,
[01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:49.800]  I got a really nice note from Dean about my writing.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.700]  And I was just like, and then, you know, we became friends.
[01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:57.380]  He wrote to me and said that he'd noticed that
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:01.860]  after a few months, I'd zeroed in on my voice,
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:03.220]  and that it's really good.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.420]  And I was like, oh, thank God he's not mad.
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:09.900]  Listen to me.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.960]  And you know, I guess most other people,
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:13.180]  I think when you're a designer
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:16.020]  and you've got something that really inspires you,
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:18.100]  you, the design, and if you're worried,
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.480]  if you're an honest designer
[01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.680]  who doesn't want to rip anybody off,
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.860]  you see a rip-off that other people don't see.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:28.940]  But yeah, Dean's Cardigan Industries, again, was more,
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:32.180]  as I recall, a little bit more episodic, too.
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.140]  You know, it was-
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:33.980]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:36.240]  I mean, textism was a blog-blog,
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.280]  just exactly what we've been talking about,
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.180]  chronological posts, top to bottom,
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.500]  period, you know, once a day, every other day,
[01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.340]  something like that.
[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.820]  But Cardigan Industries was in that,
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.220]  I don't know what we would call it, Neolithic period.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:50.660]  I don't know if that's the right word,
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:55.660]  but that gestational period of self-publishing
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:58.420]  where nobody knew what the form was supposed to be.
[01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.080]  Right.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.140]  But yeah, I totally agree about the aesthetic at the time.
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.120]  And I always loved his aesthetic.
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.020]  Yeah.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.340]  Even when he went minimal,
[01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.860]  when he relaunched textism towards the end,
[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.260]  and it didn't really last long, he totally changed.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.340]  Although I don't love that last textism,
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.860]  that super-minimal one, I don't love it.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.100]  It's my, but I got it,
[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:22.540]  and I do think he foresaw where things were going.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:23.780]  Like, it was-
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:24.620]  Yeah.
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.780]  It was super prescient about where graphic design
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.820]  was going at the time and ahead of his time.
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.140]  And of course he noticed that trend,
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.900]  but I don't have the affection for it
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.460]  that I did for his ornate, earlier style.
[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:40.100]  I mean, God, that textism thing
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:41.860]  with the guy at the top sweating
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:45.200]  and the little sort of copper plate,
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.580]  I know it wasn't copper plate,
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:49.100]  but copper plate style, all cap slogan,
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.660]  make haste slowly.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:54.620]  Which again, and again, I was like,
[01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.660]  God damn it, that should be my slogan, make haste slowly.
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:01.940]  Fuck, I was like, God damn it.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:06.420]  And again, you and I are not exactly alike,
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.540]  nobody's gonna confuse me for you or you for me,
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:11.220]  but we share a lot of similarities.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:12.320]  And in the same way,
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.180]  nobody was gonna mistake me for Dean or Dean for me,
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:19.820]  but there are the large Venn diagram overlaps
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:23.500]  and make haste slowly, God damn, that was a good slogan.
[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.940]  Yep.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.420]  Yeah, Dean was one of those people along with,
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:31.660]  I don't know, I would say like him and Paul Ford,
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:34.940]  like they had really good design sense,
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.180]  they had a great voice.
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.180]  They could write just so well, so beautifully.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.540]  So it just made me so angry.
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.620]  It's just like so angry.
[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:47.420]  I was like, if these guys,
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.540]  if they wanted to, for whatever reason,
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:52.060]  become like the best bloggers in the universe,
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:53.020]  like they totally could.
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:55.020]  And there was nothing I could do about it.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.740]  They would just be like, boop, you're done.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:00.420]  Dean's biography page, his about page,
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.280]  whatever he called it,
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:04.220]  is one of the great pieces of writing of all time.
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.900]  I mean, it was just unbelievable.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:09.620]  While we're throwing it out, I should go back.
[01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.540]  I actually, and I just saw him a few months ago.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.700]  I actually don't remember if I asked him this.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:17.940]  I should mention Andy Baio and waxy.org,
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:22.180]  as again, came out before Daring Fireball.
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:23.180]  He's still going.
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.220]  And I wonder, I don't know if he's still
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:26.980]  on movable type or not.
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.320]  Maybe.
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.100]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.940]  I don't know.
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:31.780]  I'm gonna have to find out.
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.900]  I'm gonna have to ask Andy and find out.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.220]  He might be the missing member
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.740]  of the movable type users group, or maybe not.
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:39.380]  His format hasn't changed.
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:44.380]  Andy, he posts full articles far less frequently,
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.540]  but when he does, they're gold,
[01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:51.540]  and they're more pulled straight from Andy's id
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.200]  than ever before.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.400]  I'm looking at his site right now,
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.000]  and his last one was from the end of January.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.360]  Lost media finding Bill Clinton's
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.440]  Boxer's Briefs MTV moment.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.640]  Find, tell me that's not, right there.
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.580]  It just happens to be the most recent article.
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.680]  Tell me that's not Andy Baio.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.680]  Finding Bill Clinton's 1991 or 92 appearance on MTV
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.560]  where somebody in the audience asked him
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.680]  where he wears Boxer's Briefs and finding the video, right,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.880]  from the pre-web era.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:24.520]  But his format hasn't really changed
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:27.840]  where he's stuck with the two-column layout
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.320]  of big articles on the left
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.740]  and then a sidebar with his links.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:36.800]  He's re-CSSed it.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.520]  The type is all new,
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:41.540]  but that fundamental layout structure is the same,
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.360]  which I now think of as the Andy Baio layout.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.320]  I believe, at one point, though,
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.440]  did you have your short links in a sidebar?
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.280]  Or no?
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.440]  I did, yeah, I did, yeah.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.280]  And I think the first place I remember seeing it
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.920]  was probably in Anil doing it.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.480]  Like, he had the links in the sidebar
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.360]  and then he had the regular stuff on the left.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.120]  Yeah, yeah, I had it that way for quite a while.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.580]  I don't know, and I've been thinking, like,
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:10.040]  maybe I need to go back to that, but who knows?
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.520]  Oh, let me steer you the other way.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.400]  I think, no, I think Andy, I think it works for Andy.
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:15.880]  No, I think it works for Andy, though,
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:18.080]  but it works for Andy because, to me,
[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:22.020]  even though it's width-wise his sidebar,
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.120]  it's his main blog, to me.
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.880]  And his left column is periodic.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.960]  It works for him, but I don't think it would work for you
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.080]  because you post too frequently.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.960]  I think the single stream is the way to go,
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.440]  which I've always had because I puttered around
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.480]  before I'd started adding link items,
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.620]  and by that time, I think you'd gone to single column
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:47.760]  and I just ripped it off from you, shamelessly.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.240]  But he might be- Everything is a remix.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.840]  Before we keep going, I wanted to bring up Stellar,
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:54.720]  S-T-E-L-L-A-R.
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.800]  That was your, well, you described Stellar.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.000]  So Stellar was a site that you could pull-
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.800]  When did you start your-
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.640]  Oh, Jesus.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.920]  Just to put it in our timeline.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:12.840]  2000, hmm, hmm, hold on a minute,
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:16.200]  like 2007, 2008, somewhere in that arena,
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.320]  somewhere in that area, maybe later than that.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.160]  No, you're wrong.
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:19.980]  I don't even remember.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:20.820]  You know what?
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.280]  I've got a bookmark in my notes here at the Atlantic.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.760]  Jason Kocke launches Stellar,
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.220]  a new social bookmarking site, 2011.
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.080]  Oh, 2011, okay, there you go.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.160]  Well, so much for our memory.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.480]  Yeah, and I was inspired by that site
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:37.300]  that Dean Allen had called Favored or Farved
[01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:38.580]  or however you're pronounced it.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:39.420]  Do you remember that site?
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:40.260]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.580]  We were, some friends and I were just talking about it.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:44.740]  Favored, Favored?
[01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.580]  Yeah.
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.920]  A-V-R-D, yeah, I don't know.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:49.380]  Yes, exactly.
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:52.820]  And so that was, it collected like what the most
[01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.520]  sort of favorited posts on Twitter were,
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:58.000]  the most favorited tweets on Twitter
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.520]  are within sort of a certain like universe.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:02.560]  Right, right.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:06.500]  Dean kept a hard-coded list of Twitter accounts
[01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:09.000]  that he thought were in the universe.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.480]  And of the tweets from those accounts,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.640]  it was a popularity list of favorites by the day
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.660]  or the last rolling 36 hours or something like that.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:22.080]  Right, right.
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.400]  And it was gold, it was gold.
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:29.480]  Yeah, yeah, it was really good, it was really good.
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.740]  But at some point he, I can't remember if he shut it down
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:36.220]  before I started Stellar or after I launched or what,
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:38.400]  but at some point he shut it down.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.400]  And, but I thought with the favorites thing
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.880]  like he was kind of onto something.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  And so I was like, okay, I'm gonna do a site
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.360]  where you can sign up and sort of authenticate
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.640]  with different services.
[01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:57.200]  And I think I launched with Twitter, Flickr, YouTube,
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:59.080]  and Vimeo.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:03.360]  And so you could collect your favorites all in one place
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.560]  and then you could follow other people's favorites.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.340]  And that sort of became your main.
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:11.320]  So it was like a, instead of Dean
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.580]  just having a hard-coded list,
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.820]  you could have your own list of people
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:16.880]  that you wanted to follow in their favorites.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.720]  And then I did some stuff I pulled out.
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.480]  Okay, what are the, like within the community,
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:22.580]  within the Stellar community,
[01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:23.920]  like what are the trending links
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.600]  and what are the trending like videos and things like that?
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.200]  So I did some stuff like that too.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.820]  And yeah, and I think it lasted for, I don't know,
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:34.680]  two, three years, four years, I don't know how long.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:37.100]  As I recall though, you always described it
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.160]  as an experiment.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.640]  Like it was never, I don't know if you said beta,
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.840]  I don't know if you said experiment,
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.840]  but it seemingly never really officially went out.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.480]  Not that it wasn't public, it had to be secret, but.
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:54.680]  Yeah, it was public, but basically like,
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.200]  I think I let the first like few thousand people in,
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:42:59.400]  like there was a waiting list of,
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:01.440]  I think 15,000 people or something.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:04.200]  And I let the first few thousand in.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.720]  And at that point, like my technical ability
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.680]  ran into problems with trying to figure out
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.940]  how to scale this damn thing,
[01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:15.240]  because it was like tens of thousands of new items a day
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.960]  and streaming into the database.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.320]  And then it's like, oh crap,
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.800]  like I don't really know anything
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.380]  about how to design a database for this.
[01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:25.960]  And at some point it became too much for me.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.360]  And also like the writing was on the wall for like open APIs.
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.980]  It was Instagram had come out
[01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:34.780]  and it was obvious that Instagram was never really
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:38.960]  gonna have an open API in the way that Twitter did.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:41.360]  And I think that TikTok maybe,
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.940]  no, it wasn't TikTok, it was Snapchat.
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.840]  And like Snapchat, there was no API in sight.
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:49.720]  And I was like, oh, okay, so this is where things are going.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.320]  And I can't have a whole service
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.220]  that relies on these open APIs
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:56.980]  when there aren't gonna be any open APIs going forward,
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:01.120]  perhaps, and now we're seeing that with Twitter.
[01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:02.760]  I mean, Twitter has always been back and forth
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:03.760]  with their API, right?
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:05.240]  It's come on in, you can do anything.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:07.580]  And it's like, no, go away, we hate you.
[01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.080]  And then it's like, oh no, come on in.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:12.480]  And then it's like, after a while, it's like, fuck you.
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.840]  Now I'm gonna do something else, so.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.200]  Yeah, it's funny, and everything starts small, right?
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.720]  Apple famously, but it's true, it's absolutely true
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:26.540]  that Apple started with two Steves in a garage,
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.880]  an actual garage, and it was two guys
[01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.700]  who were both, happened to be historic level geniuses
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.800]  in their own very different ways, and got along.
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.700]  But it was two guys putting boards together,
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:44.920]  and then selling them at hobbyist meetups.
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.920]  Facebook famously started as one kid in a dorm at Harvard.
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.500]  So at some point, Facebook was the size
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:58.000]  of Daring Fireball or Katky.org, right?
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  It's a guy typing PHP and publishing stuff by himself.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.420]  And Twitter never was one person, it wasn't an indie thing,
[01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:13.920]  but when Twitter debuted and spun out of Odeo,
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.320]  it was tiny, right?
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:19.700]  I just was telling this story to Ben Thompson,
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:21.800]  I think on Dithering the other day,
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.800]  that in 2007, I believe, I think Twitter started in 2006,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.680]  and I got on it right away,
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:30.960]  because I just got it right away,
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.600]  and I was like, oh, this is awesome.
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:35.720]  And in 2007, I was in San Francisco for WWDC,
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.120]  and somebody invited me to Twitter headquarters,
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.640]  which was like right down the street from WWDC,
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.040]  for lunch one of the days with the whole staff.
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:48.000]  And they wanted to talk to a semi-popular Twitter user,
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.760]  which tells you how early it was
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.720]  that I counted as semi-popular on Twitter.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.320]  But the whole company, we all had lunch together,
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:45:59.080]  and it wasn't like I needed a microphone,
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:02.040]  or it was about, I don't know, I'd say about 20 people.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.400]  I mean, I don't know if there was somebody
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.120]  who knocked off that day, but as far as I could tell,
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.320]  the whole company was 20 people, so the scale was,
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.460]  that's still like the same ballpark, right?
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:14.120]  Like, I can comprehend 20 person staff.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:18.020]  And there was one guy, I think it was Blaine Cook,
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.160]  I think Craig Hockenberry has been writing about it
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:25.200]  in the RIP Twitter Clients thing,
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.560]  where it was like one guy who was doing the APIs
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.960]  for Twitter, and he was just taught at a personal level.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.420]  It wasn't like you're interacting
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:37.200]  with the Twitter developer connection board
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.200]  and posting tickets and stuff.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.260]  Craig wanting to write the Mac app
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.260]  instead of interacting with the website,
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.940]  and then the iPhone gets announced,
[01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.160]  and he's, oh, I can take this thing
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:49.200]  I've been writing for the Mac and put it on the iPhone.
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.360]  But when he was making Twitterrific for the Mac,
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.520]  which was before the iPhone was announced,
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.800]  he just talked to Blaine Cook,
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.320]  and Blaine would be like, well, what do you need?
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.880]  And he'd be like, oh, because Blaine was thinking,
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:02.200]  oh, we never really thought about somebody doing
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.720]  like a Mac or a Windows client for this,
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.520]  but that's an awesome idea.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.380]  Wow, instantly got it, and was like,
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.760]  oh, that would be an awesome idea.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.080]  He was like, well, what would you need?
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.840]  Because you never thought of it as something
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.040]  that someone would make an app for,
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.000]  this is what's missing from the API,
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.360]  and the next day, Blaine is like, here, how about this?
[01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:22.280]  Does that work for you?
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:24.520]  And it's there, and he could use it.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.940]  And so it was like that level of indie spirit
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:31.280]  in the early days, and then it's Elaine Bennis's
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.360]  famous words, yada, yada, yada, then,
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:39.680]  and then it's a multi-billion dollar public corporation,
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:43.780]  and it's an orifice in terms of interacting with them.
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:47.100]  But it was a slow boil, though,
[01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:51.260]  and it's hurt what you and I do terribly, in my opinion,
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.940]  because most of what we used to, I think it's true,
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:59.460]  I know most of what I used to link to in the early days,
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.020]  or what I was happier linking to,
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:04.860]  was other people's blog posts,
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.280]  and it felt more social, in a way, right,
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.060]  because it's of somebody else's voice,
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:15.300]  and it just, I don't wanna call anybody,
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.140]  but it could be Andy, it could be you,
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.140]  it could be Mark Pilgrim, who stopped,
[01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:22.100]  and just dozens, but just dozens and dozens of people,
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:25.900]  including people who weren't blogging
[01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:28.060]  to become popular bloggers,
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.580]  but maybe only posted once a month,
[01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:32.540]  but they did post once a month,
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.660]  but they had their own blog,
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:38.820]  and if it was just a clever solution to a CSS problem,
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:43.820]  and then you'd publish it, and then I'd link to it,
[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:48.860]  and it really is just the slowest boiling
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:53.220]  of slow boiling frogs in a pot of water problem
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.580]  that I just kind of saw it happening,
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:48:58.440]  but in hindsight, it's so crystal clear
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.440]  that the Pied Piper song of the ease of tweeting,
[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:07.080]  and in the universe of people I would've linked to
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:10.100]  back in the blogging days, pre-Twitter,
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.820]  it's Twitter that took all of their posting, not Facebook.
[01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:17.340]  I've never even been on Facebook,
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:21.300]  and I've never, I can count literally,
[01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:25.300]  maybe on one hand, certainly on both hands,
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.860]  the number of times that there's been something on Facebook
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.220]  that I'd wished I could link to from Daring Fireball,
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:35.060]  but can't because it's behind the Facebook sign-in thing.
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:36.940]  Literally only a handful of times.
[01:49:36.940 --> 01:49:39.980]  It's Twitter that took up the gas there,
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:43.380]  but all of them, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:46.760]  all of them aren't on the open web.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:50.340]  They're not the web, and they just sucked up
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:53.660]  so many other people, the people who aren't trying
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:56.140]  to do it as a living or a vocation
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:58.420]  because it's so much easier, right?
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.740]  There's no blame whatsoever for people
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.400]  who've faded away from blogging
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.020]  and put all of their public posting onto Twitter
[01:50:06.020 --> 01:50:07.980]  because I see how much easier it is,
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.500]  and I know that's how human psychology works.
[01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:13.100]  It's exactly like what we were talking about earlier
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:15.620]  about not having titles, right?
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:19.100]  Which is also exactly why, they don't call it a title,
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.380]  it's called a subject, but it's exactly why
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:24.040]  it's so much easier to text someone than to email them,
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.420]  even if it's the same text, right?
[01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:28.820]  You and I setting up this podcast,
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.980]  we did it entirely through messages.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:33.220]  We didn't send a single email to each other.
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:36.660]  I never send email to friends for things like that anymore,
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.980]  and part of it is email is worse,
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.960]  and email, my inbox is noisy,
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.360]  and my messages app isn't noisy at all,
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.560]  but part of it is the lack of a subject, right?
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:48.720]  It's just less effort for something
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.940]  that I don't really care about.
[01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:53.420]  It's my professional, my text messages
[01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:56.340]  through messages aren't my work, right?
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.840]  So they're dashed off and casual,
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:01.340]  and it's a huge decrease in cognitive load,
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:03.580]  so I don't blame them, but my God,
[01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.000]  it's made all of these things so much harder to link to.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.460]  I mean, and I dread it now, I dread,
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:12.500]  I think it's inevitable at this point,
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.980]  the coming disappearance of Twitter's archives,
[01:51:15.980 --> 01:51:19.940]  because there's an awful lot over the last 10 years
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.740]  where people, you know, and people,
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:26.980]  it's a misappropriation of the forum posting a tweet thread
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.080]  instead of a blog post, but again,
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.460]  if you don't already have,
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.860]  but if you don't already have a blog,
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:35.220]  posting a tweet thread is way easier
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.220]  than setting up a blog just to post this one thing,
[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:41.740]  but I don't, untold number of tweets that I've linked to
[01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:43.580]  and tweet threads that I've linked to,
[01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:45.520]  I think are, now I have no faith
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:48.580]  that they're going to persist into perpetuity.
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:49.900]  Yeah.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:51.900]  It's not only sort of the ease of use,
[01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:53.140]  but it's the network, right?
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:56.980]  So you, like when you tweet, you have a built-in sort of,
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:51:58.660]  people have a built-in way to read,
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.620]  people have a built-in way to respond,
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:02.540]  and when you're talking about sort of the threads
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:03.980]  instead of blog posts,
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:05.600]  sure, you could post it on your blog,
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.500]  but, you know, and some, you know,
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.420]  through RSS and stuff like that,
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:13.120]  like we've sort of cobbled together the network stuff,
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:14.980]  and when Google Reader was a thing,
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:17.560]  there was a sort of a built-in network effect there,
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:19.240]  but, you know, the thing about Twitter
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:22.180]  is that you post a tweet storm or a thread,
[01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:25.220]  people can respond immediately and individually
[01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:28.940]  to every single sort of point that you make along the way.
[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:30.940]  That's the case with Facebook as well.
[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:32.660]  You can comment, you can like,
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:36.620]  you see things that other people have liked in your feed.
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:38.600]  There's discovery mechanisms as well.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:39.780]  The world of blogs,
[01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:42.940]  they had that cobbled together a little bit
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:45.940]  with things like RSS and with things like Technorati
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:49.100]  and like weblog search engines and all that sort of stuff,
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.740]  but Facebook and Twitter just came along and were like,
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:54.500]  hey, we're going to do this all in one basket.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.260]  It's going to be super easy.
[01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:57.100]  Here you go.
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.940]  And it's kind of no wonder that it took off
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.260]  the way it did for both of them.
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:02.460]  Theoretically, like,
[01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.860]  Facebook is the biggest blogging company in the world.
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:08.480]  They were the ones who really figured out
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.640]  how to monetize blogging,
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.420]  and it made them a $500 billion company for a while.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:15.180]  They figured out two things,
[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:18.100]  and again, I've never even had a Facebook account,
[01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:22.380]  but I do recognize the genius of it in some ways.
[01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:24.020]  They figured out the monetization there.
[01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.580]  I mean, they're one of the five biggest companies
[01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.420]  in the world.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.140]  And the other thing that they did,
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:32.500]  and this is the part where I give them full credit
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:33.860]  and actually admire it,
[01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.260]  is they're the first and perhaps still only company
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:42.260]  that cracked the nut of getting regular people to blog,
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:46.100]  whether they think of it as blogging or not, right?
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.420]  Just regular people, and they're posting things
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:51.820]  like their kids' graduation pictures
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:55.420]  and just an update about somebody's health
[01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:56.540]  or something like that.
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.700]  And again, saying positive things about Facebook
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:02.500]  and privacy seems counterintuitive,
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.300]  because I rant and rail about the negative aspects
[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.420]  of their regard for privacy in other regards.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:13.060]  But from the perspective of users,
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:17.860]  the literally multiple billions of users that they have,
[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.220]  they solved the nut of people feeling comfortable
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:25.820]  and understanding the circle of who things are going out to
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.140]  so that they could do things
[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:32.140]  like if somebody's mother is ill and posting it
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:35.380]  in a way that they know is only going out
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:38.860]  to the people who they want it to go out to with updates.
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:41.300]  And I have all the admiration in the world for that
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.900]  because it's useful, right?
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:45.980]  They turned literally almost everybody in the world
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:48.780]  into a blogger, which was the original dream, right?
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:51.540]  That's the Dave Weiner dream, except for the fact
[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:55.140]  that they were doing it in this locked ecosystem
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:58.540]  that's not on the open web, but I admire that greatly.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:02.360]  But it's for us wanting to link to things, it's terrible.
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.740]  The average thing I link to now is a post
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.700]  at a professional publication.
[01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:11.700]  Yep, that is probably behind some sort of soft paywall.
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:14.340]  Right, and that's the other thing that's risen,
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.420]  and it's on my list.
[01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:17.540]  Again, part of my homework,
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:18.740]  I've actually got an agenda here.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.100]  I wanna talk about paywalls.
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.720]  The other day, and again, bringing up Dave Weiner,
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.500]  Dave Weiner mentioned this as a use for the chat GPT,
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:30.880]  the chat.openAI thing.
[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:37.420]  He said that he asked the chat GPT the question,
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:41.980]  what are the best non-paywalled news sites?
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:46.140]  And said he got a great list, and so I tried the same query,
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:48.300]  and it's astonishing.
[01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:51.560]  It's like number one, BBC, number two, Reuters,
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.300]  number three, I forget.
[01:55:53.300 --> 01:55:56.540]  See, I might be CNN, I forget, but it was a good one.
[01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:59.580]  Number four, number four and number five
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:03.060]  was the New York Times, and the chat thing
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:06.740]  after New York Times, it gave it an ordered list,
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:09.180]  one through 10, and after the New York Times
[01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:12.400]  in parentheses said the New York Times does have a paywall,
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.220]  but with a very generous allotment of monthly open views.
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:21.220]  And so it effectively wrote a footnote, right?
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:24.340]  And I think, and I honestly think
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.480]  that's a fair description of the New York Times.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.580]  I think that the New York Times,
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:33.220]  the where they put their paywall is genius
[01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:35.980]  and generous and good enough with the understanding
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:39.400]  that they needed and continued to need a subscriber base
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:43.420]  that wants to burst through that and is willing to pay
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:46.140]  rather than stick around with deleting their cookies
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:47.720]  every two days or whatever.
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.940]  But it was an astonishingly good answer.
[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:53.620]  But the fact that it's even a question,
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:56.460]  like how do you get to non-pay,
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:58.260]  what are the best non-paywall news,
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:02.360]  is so antithetical to the concept,
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:04.900]  the original concept of the World Wide Web
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:09.340]  that it's flabbergasting and downright
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:12.160]  from the perspective of 1996,
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.340]  I would say it's dystopic.
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:18.980]  It's a dystopia to think that the,
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.860]  I don't know that the idea that a paywall on the web,
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.700]  it would have been laughed at, I think, in 1996.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.740]  It's what are you talking about?
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:28.580]  You don't get it.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:31.540]  You know, you're like somebody who wants to use
[01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:33.780]  QuarkXPress to publish their website, you know?
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:38.180]  Like QuarkXPress, I loved, and it's a wonderful tool,
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:39.980]  but it's not for publishing to the web.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:42.020]  So the idea that you want to make people pay
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:44.700]  to see the stuff, but here we are, right?
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:48.220]  And what is it, how frustrated are you by that trend?
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:52.820]  I mean, purely as someone who wants to point people
[01:57:52.820 --> 01:57:56.740]  to things that they can actually read without paying money,
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.140]  it's very frustrating.
[01:57:58.140 --> 01:58:00.500]  But at the same time, if you look at the New York Times
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:01.580]  or you look at the Atlantic
[01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.180]  or any of these other publications,
[01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.460]  it's like that's where those paywalls
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:10.060]  or those membership programs or however you want to put it,
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:14.140]  like they're paying for a lot of good writing
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:15.700]  and a lot of good journalism.
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:17.660]  It's also paying for a lot of garbage,
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:20.060]  but I'm interested in linking to the good stuff.
[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:23.060]  And I get email all the time from people who are like,
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:24.820]  this stuff is paywall, what are you doing?
[01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:28.400]  And it's like, well, I would love it if it weren't,
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:31.660]  but this is where this particular piece of writing was.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.660]  And I think it's worth your attention
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.180]  if somehow you happen to have a subscription
[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:40.140]  or if you can somehow get around it with incognito window
[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.440]  or deleting your cookies.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.580]  But it's really frustrating from my standpoint
[01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:48.560]  as a blogger who likes to link
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:49.460]  to a lot of different things.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:51.380]  I think that there's a couple of things going on here.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:54.340]  It's like there's consolidation and then there's paywalls.
[01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.100]  And increasingly that consolidation
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:58.380]  is happening behind paywalls.
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:00.620]  And so you get this double whammy where people
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.740]  aren't writing for a lot of different crazy things.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:07.080]  Although now with Substack is I think trying
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:08.420]  to push back on that.
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:12.420]  But Substack is itself paywalled for the most part.
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:13.980]  And Medium is that way too.
[01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:19.060]  And so you're getting kind of this double whammy,
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.220]  a squeeze from both ends.
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.660]  I at least admire more when a paywall site,
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:26.460]  and I don't wanna speak poorly of Substack
[01:59:26.460 --> 01:59:31.460]  because overall I think Substack has been a force for good
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:35.080]  and is pushing in the right direction.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:39.720]  It is pushing back, pushing the web and independent solo
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:43.740]  or like two people or three people teams or whatever
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:46.000]  back towards where I think it should be
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.880]  and where I think we lost this opportunity.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:51.240]  So overall I'm two thumbs up on Substack.
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:53.580]  But one thing that irritates me about Substack
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:57.620]  is when a post is paywalled it's usually below the fold.
[01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:00.680]  And so I'm like oh this was a free post, great.
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:01.600]  I can link to it.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:05.160]  And then I hit the space bar to scroll down
[02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:08.100]  and it's oh you wanna, it goes.
[02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.520]  So in some ways I admire a paywalled site
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:13.880]  that at least covers up my whole browser window
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.880]  right away like the Financial Times.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.920]  Like I hate it, but at least the Financial Times
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:23.220]  tells me right away this whole thing is paywalled.
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:24.060]  Huge frustration.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:27.480]  And the FT in particular has also been very consistent.
[02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:29.960]  Like they've had a paywall for I think a long time.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:32.560]  And Wall Street Journal too, right.
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.000]  Wall Street Journal famously kind of broke the nut of it
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.160]  with $100 subscriptions, like a lot of money.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:43.820]  You know and everybody was like well easy for them
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:45.720]  because the people who wanna read to Wall Street Journal
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.680]  are business people who can write it off to work.
[02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:51.640]  Which is true, but still just knowing your audience
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:53.080]  isn't a fault, right?
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.080]  But they've had that paywall from the beginning.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:56.440]  They never yanked it out.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:58.240]  The Wall Street Journal was always like fuck you,
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:00:59.080]  you're gonna pay.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.800]  But I get around it with the Wall Street Journal
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.080]  and I don't know what, I should probably someday,
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:06.120]  I've still never done a reader poll.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.780]  I should, because there are many questions I have
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:10.520]  about my audience that I don't know.
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:13.680]  I think I know my audience, but one thing I suspect
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:18.640]  is that a lot of them subscribe to the Apple One,
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.880]  just give us $30 a month and we give you everything,
[02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:25.900]  more iCloud storage and Apple Music which is the big one
[02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:27.320]  and you get it, your Apple TV,
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:29.200]  so you can watch all the Apple TV shows.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.160]  You get the Apple Fitness and you get Apple News.
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.680]  I don't like Apple News because it's too many ads,
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:40.540]  but the Apple News includes the Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:43.240]  So when I link to the journal, I almost always include
[02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.840]  an Apple News link thinking at least some decent chunk
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.120]  of my readers being Apple nut jobs probably have.
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:52.640]  If they don't subscribe to the journal,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:55.400]  they have an Apple News link and can click that and read it.
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.660]  But the journal still has so much original reporting,
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:03.920]  especially in my, the areas I'm hyper-focused on
[02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:07.060]  and I wanna give credit to original reporting
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:09.700]  rather than link to somebody's regurgitation of it,
[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:12.040]  which annoys me, but on the other hand,
[02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.120]  I know that most people don't subscribe
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.960]  to the Wall Street Journal, so it's frustrating.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.520]  The other thing about that that I think the trend
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.520]  is subscriptions and memberships
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:29.520]  and whatever you wanna call it work
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:34.520]  and people like them because once you're in,
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.920]  you get this premium experience.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:40.160]  I have this theory and I would,
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:43.880]  I think I'm exactly right that the resurgence
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:48.520]  in email newsletters, which is absolutely a resurgence,
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:50.520]  it was like, because email newsletters
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:52.120]  were a big thing before the web
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:54.200]  or when the web was a thing that people didn't know
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:57.360]  what to do or it was so friggin' slow,
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:00.200]  but people got email in the early 90s
[02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.840]  and then somebody figured out, well,
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:04.940]  we could write a publication and just email it to people
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:06.100]  and it was awesome, right?
[02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:09.180]  There was the longest standing independent publisher
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:12.620]  I can think of is Tidbits, tidbits.com,
[02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:15.520]  which started as both an email newsletter
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:18.560]  and a weekly hypercard stack.
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:19.400]  Ooh.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.480]  Wow.
[02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:24.080]  Right, it was like once a week they'd put out an issue
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:26.840]  and you could go to the InfoMac archives
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.000]  and there's like an FTP address
[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.980]  and they'd post it to Usenet
[02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:32.920]  and you would download the hypercard stack
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:35.120]  and I think the way it worked, it was very clever,
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.120]  you didn't have like a folder full of stacks,
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:39.120]  it's like whatever you downloaded,
[02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:42.760]  it would add to your Tidbits hypercard stack, right?
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:43.980]  So you'd just get the new issue
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:45.960]  and it didn't clutter up your drive,
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:48.960]  but they were a plain text email newsletter
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.880]  in the early 90s, I think literally before
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:53.920]  Tim Berners-Lee invented the web
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:56.440]  or at least before he made it public
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.860]  and now it's a big thing again,
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:00.360]  but my theory is very simple.
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:03.960]  People like email newsletters because the email,
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.500]  it's not because it shows up automatically in their inbox,
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.360]  which is, you know, it's a factor,
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:11.620]  but it's that once it's there,
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:14.700]  you just start reading and you scroll down
[02:04:14.700 --> 02:04:16.600]  and then you get to the end and you're done
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.080]  and there's no ads in the middle,
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:22.680]  nothing ever ever, it technically can't even happen,
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.360]  nothing ever pops up while you're reading
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.700]  and says would you like to subscribe to our newsletter,
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:30.360]  here's an X, you know,
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.560]  because you're already on their newsletter, right?
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:34.820]  It sounds like the dumbest thing in the world,
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:37.200]  but it turns out in today's web,
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.800]  it's so corrupt with ad tech
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.600]  that just being able to read from the beginning to the end
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:46.600]  without any interruption in the stream of the text
[02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:49.040]  is actually a premium reading experience
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:50.020]  and for the most part,
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:52.020]  you can only get it now in email newsletters,
[02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:55.900]  you can't get it on the web, which is bananas.
[02:04:56.840 --> 02:05:00.080]  Like the fact that you and I don't interrupt our stuff
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.560]  with ads in the middle, it makes us unique.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:05.360]  I mean, which is crazy.
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:07.640]  Yeah, it does, it does.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:10.800]  And yeah, I mean, there's a blog that I read regularly
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:12.880]  that started adding like an email pop-up
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:16.160]  and I'm just like, dude, come on, seriously?
[02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.480]  I know it juices your numbers, but don't.
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.840]  And I think the New York Times
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:22.400]  has always been forward thinking,
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:24.200]  they've always had a pretty good website
[02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:26.320]  for a newspaper, always,
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:30.000]  and I think it's why they're thriving when other newspapers,
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.500]  or at least succeeding, if not thriving,
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:34.600]  while other newspapers haven't.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:39.600]  But even them still, to this day, in March 2023,
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:45.120]  clearly value their print edition
[02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.080]  more than they do the web edition.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.820]  And in terms of design
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.220]  and in terms of what they're willing to do,
[02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:55.520]  they never put an ad in the middle of an article,
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:58.040]  in the middle of a column in the print edition.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:06:00.360]  They never have and they never will,
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:01.920]  but they do it on the web.
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:05.040]  Every article has, as you scroll down on your phone,
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:06.560]  there are ads in the middle.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:09.380]  And even if you're using an ad blocker that blocks the ads,
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:12.120]  it puts gaps in the article.
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:15.720]  And they also add stupid things that aren't ads
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:18.360]  and don't get blocked elsewhere on the web
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:19.920]  or elsewhere on this topic,
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:22.160]  or here's a carousel or something
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:24.280]  that isn't part of the article, right?
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:27.560]  They're like, why in the world are you trying to keep me
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:29.240]  from reading to the end of this article
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:31.460]  by making me click to a different article
[02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:32.380]  in the middle of the article?
[02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:34.120]  Why are you doing this to me?
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:37.120]  Thank God I've got a strong enough attention span
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:37.960]  to do this.
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:39.560]  And it would infuriate me
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.160]  if I'm the one who wrote the article.
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.400]  And I write this article
[02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:45.800]  and I want people to read it from the beginning to the end,
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:50.760]  and my own publisher is trying to steer people away
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:52.380]  from it halfway through.
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:53.840]  And the New York Times does it,
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.240]  and they're one of the best.
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:59.760]  It's, do you want to get really angry?
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:03.940]  Here's also on my topic list, 404s, 404s.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.760]  Okay, what about them?
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:08.280]  How many do you think you have
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.600]  in the kaki.org archive?
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:11.440]  Links to-
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.360]  Oh, you mean the entire, oh, geez.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.960]  Dead links, in other words, dead links.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.840]  Oh my God.
[02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:19.640]  Yeah, I mean, thousands?
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.480]  Most of what?
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:24.220]  Probably over 50%, I would say.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:25.480]  I would- Like the majority?
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.080]  I could probably do it,
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:28.800]  and maybe it's the sort of thing Andy
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:29.880]  would probably want to do.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.880]  Andy Baio would probably want to do.
[02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:34.440]  I bet if we exported our sites,
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.800]  I bet there's a very smooth curve that is very consistent
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.980]  and has never changed,
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:46.400]  that there's about a four to five year horizon
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:51.040]  where links start going 404 or dead,
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.940]  whether the whole website's defunct
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:56.100]  or just they change their CMS or their URL structure
[02:07:56.100 --> 02:08:00.920]  and don't add redirects from the beginning.
[02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:04.160]  So starting around 2006, 2007 for me,
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:08.120]  but probably starting around 2002, 2003 for you,
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:10.960]  four or five year old links start going bad,
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.000]  and then by the time you get to 10 years,
[02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.600]  it's a majority of them,
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:18.260]  and the early years of Daring Fireball,
[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:21.980]  it really is sickening to me how much of it is dead.
[02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.180]  So I built this thing, I don't know, a few years ago.
[02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:27.120]  It's not active anymore, but it was called like the,
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:27.960]  what did I call it?
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:30.240]  Oh, the Accidental Bookshop.
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:33.000]  And basically I went through and I crawled all of my archives
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.360]  for every single book that I've ever linked to at Amazon
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:40.300]  and then compiled basically the most popular links
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:42.280]  and all that sort of stuff.
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:45.640]  And the very first links I ever posted to Amazon,
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.320]  they still all work back in 2000.
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:52.400]  I think 1999 was probably the first time I linked to Amazon.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:53.800]  Those links all still work.
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.640]  If you click on a link to the Matrix DVD,
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.720]  it goes to the page for the Matrix DVD.
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:01.000]  It might be out of stock.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.480]  It might be out of stock, but it's still there.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.280]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.800]  But even stuff like I will go back,
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.240]  I'll be writing a post or whatever,
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:13.780]  and I'll have to go look at a tag page of mine
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:17.100]  to figure out what I've written previously about it.
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:20.280]  And I'll see YouTube embeds from six months ago,
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:21.120]  they're already dead.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.360]  Which is because the channel goes private
[02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:28.400]  or the thing gets deleted or just like whatever.
[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:31.720]  But yeah, it's a problem.
[02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:33.520]  Yeah, and like with YouTube,
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.880]  and I know you link to a lot more YouTube than I do,
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.120]  but I do, but with YouTube,
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.760]  I think what happens is a lot of times archived,
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:44.560]  and again, archived meaning like six, seven months ago,
[02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:48.960]  stuff then gets hit with a copyright challenge or something
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:50.000]  and gets pulled.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.240]  And whether it was a legit challenge or not,
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:56.880]  the channel creator doesn't really care
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:59.760]  because the YouTube game is so much
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:04.760]  about your latest video is the only one that really matters
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:07.160]  and is the only one getting any traffic.
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:11.360]  And it's much more like surfing, right?
[02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:12.640]  It's just you're in the moment
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:13.640]  and all they're trying to do
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:16.060]  is keep from the wave knocking them off.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.720]  It seems very nerve-wracking to me, honestly,
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:23.940]  and I don't think I would do it even if I were younger.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:27.840]  But they don't care, not that they don't care.
[02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:30.280]  And obviously some channels do care,
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.840]  but yeah, even YouTube links go bad,
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:34.920]  sometimes surprisingly quickly.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:38.920]  I've long had, and again, I'm running out of time here
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:40.360]  for all these ideas I've had,
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.360]  but I've long had an idea to automate somehow
[02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:47.240]  finding dead links in my archive
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:52.240]  and then trying to find if there's a archive.org archive
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.000]  that I can then rewrite the link or add,
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.340]  append at the bottom of all those posts, this link is dead,
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:01.900]  but here's an active link to archive.org,
[02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:06.900]  which at this point, it would be,
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:08.720]  I could never do it.
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:12.480]  Even in my wildest dreams of productivity
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:15.720]  and un-procrastination, I could never do it by hand.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:18.480]  I could either automate it
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.440]  or I could hire somebody to do it by hand,
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:26.440]  but it would surely be a months-long project
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:29.440]  even if I hired someone who was very productive
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.600]  for eight hours a day.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.200]  It's that many links.
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.720]  And the other part that makes me so queasy
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.720]  and ill and angry is that even that pipe dream
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:47.960]  of rectifying those dead links
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:51.080]  from literally sometimes just five years ago or less,
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:53.220]  but certainly the ones from 10 years ago
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:56.720]  and the 15 and 20-year-old ones are mostly dead,
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.620]  even that pipe dream of doing it is all hanging
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:05.400]  by the single thread of archive.org and the Internet Archive.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  One thing that's a nonprofit foundation,
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:15.400]  or not volunteer, I know Jason Scott is paid,
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:17.320]  volunteer's not right,
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:20.800]  but funded by volunteer contributions.
[02:12:20.800 --> 02:12:21.760]  They don't have ads.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:26.160]  They don't seem to have a huge benefactor or something.
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:27.000]  I don't know.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.240]  I have no idea why somebody like Google
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.960]  doesn't just give them more money to make it faster
[02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:39.320]  because Google could give them a literal,
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:41.440]  literal couch change,
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.360]  and it would probably make a huge difference to them.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:47.680]  But if not, if something ever happened to the,
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:49.800]  the Internet Archive is literally
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:52.440]  our modern library of Alexander
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  in terms of its singular nature
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:58.240]  as an archive of all that stuff on the web.
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.800]  Even Wikipedia, which is awesome,
[02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.440]  because of its open nature,
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.480]  there's copies of that database.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.320]  So if something happened to the Wikipedia Foundation,
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:13.720]  at least a copy of where it stands
[02:13:13.720 --> 02:13:15.600]  would be all over the place.
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.640]  It wouldn't be lost.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.280]  I don't know if the culture of it
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.280]  and somebody could pick up where they left off culturally
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.160]  and internal culture-wise in terms of the way
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:32.080]  that they somehow have made it work
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:36.160]  with their rules on editing and style and stuff like that.
[02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:39.840]  I had an idea, and I'll blurb it out here.
[02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:41.960]  I might have blurbed it on a previous podcast.
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:44.120]  So I used to be more precious about my,
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.080]  I would like to write an article about X,
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:48.160]  so I'm therefore not going to talk about it
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:50.080]  because I don't want anybody to steal it.
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:53.120]  But as I've gotten, I told you my list of
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:57.920]  I would like to write about X and never get to it
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.880]  is an entire second copy of Daring Fireball
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:04.640]  of original content, never written content.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.320]  But I have an idea for an article that Wikipedia,
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:10.840]  in a way, as a standalone entity,
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:13.480]  is the original vision for the web.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.000]  Because it's, there's no, it's easy to read.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.760]  The things, the articles link to each other
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.480]  where it makes sense.
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.880]  It's, you know, it's not quite
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:30.920]  because I do think Tim Berners-Lee's original vision
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:33.680]  for the web included things like your site and my site
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:36.320]  where we have a personal voice, right?
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.000]  Like it could be a personal voice.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.760]  It could be an institutional voice.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.280]  And one thing lacking from my analogy of Wikipedia
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.920]  is the web as it was originally envisioned
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.760]  is nothing has a personal voice.
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.120]  It's all written in the institutional voice of Wikipedia
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:53.760]  as it should be, right?
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:55.480]  But in spirit, it is.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:59.480]  But the rest of the web is absolutely antithetical
[02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.400]  to the original spirit of the web.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.520]  Including the fact that,
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.040]  I mean, because one of the,
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.880]  I think Tim Berners-Lee himself wrote it,
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.560]  the famous cool URLs don't change mantra.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.240]  All right, let me take one more break here.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:18.160]  Thank our third and final sponsor of the episode.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.200]  It's one more fine sponsor.
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:22.960]  And it is our good friends at Memberful.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.280]  Memberful has a world-class support team
[02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:28.280]  ready to help you simplify your memberships
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:31.160]  and grow your revenue if you're a creator
[02:15:31.160 --> 02:15:34.520]  who wants to use memberships and subscriptions
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  to grow your business.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:38.480]  They are passionate about your success
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:41.760]  and they always give you access to a real human being
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:43.760]  if you need help or just want advice
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:45.640]  on like how to price things,
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:48.440]  how to section off what you,
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.280]  as Jason and I have just been talking about,
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.080]  where stuff goes for free
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.360]  and what goes behind the member paywall.
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:57.920]  You can monetize your passion with membership
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:01.680]  and you keep full control and ownership of your audience
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.800]  and your brand.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:05.400]  It doesn't look like you're publishing through Memberful
[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:07.120]  and you're a Memberful site.
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:10.040]  Memberful's just sort of a silent partner on the back end
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:11.720]  and they give you analytics.
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:15.280]  It gives you an easy to use in-depth view of what's working,
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:16.480]  what are the things that you're doing
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.960]  that people are actually using, consuming, reading
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:21.440]  and what's not and where you might wanna double down
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.920]  and go in a different direction to grow.
[02:16:23.920 --> 02:16:25.600]  It's the easiest way to sell memberships
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.160]  to your audience and it lets you build
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:29.200]  a sustainable recurring revenue
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.920]  and it's used by some of the biggest independent creators
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.160]  on the web and they have everything you need
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:35.360]  to run a membership program,
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:38.560]  including a streamlined and powerful checkout,
[02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:41.160]  easy to use member portal so people can go there
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:42.640]  and like change their email address,
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:45.400]  change their credit card, cancel their membership,
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.800]  renew their membership, anything they wanna do,
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.400]  they handle all that or change their password, right?
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:51.580]  That sort of thing.
[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:53.160]  Very, very tricky to get right.
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:54.480]  They handle all of that
[02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:57.200]  and also a membership management dashboard
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.620]  and you could use that membership management dashboard
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:03.440]  to export your membership database or list anytime you want.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:05.880]  If you wanna move away from Memberful,
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:10.880]  your whole member list is yours to keep and take.
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:12.540]  That's how confident they are
[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:13.720]  that you're gonna stick with Memberful.
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:16.120]  They seamlessly integrate with the tools you already use,
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:18.440]  including things like MailChimp, WordPress,
[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:20.360]  Stripe, Discord and more.
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:21.580]  It's a great service.
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:24.560]  I subscribe to more, I keep saying this,
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:26.400]  I subscribe to more Memberfuls than I should.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:28.640]  It's racking up to a lot a month
[02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:30.460]  but it's a great, great service.
[02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:33.900]  Six colors, max stories, the list goes on and on
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:35.540]  of the ones that I subscribe to
[02:17:35.540 --> 02:17:37.600]  and I know that the people who run those sites,
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:39.200]  I know them personally and I know they're happy
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:40.040]  with Memberful.
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.280]  Where do you go to check it out?
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.680]  Go to Memberful, M-E-M-B-E-R-F-U-L,
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.880]  memberful.com slash talk show.
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.880]  No the, just slash talk show, memberful.com slash talk show.
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:56.720]  Monetize your passion with membership.
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:59.400]  You can get a free trial, no credit card required.
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:00.760]  Just go check them out.
[02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:06.400]  Speaking of memberships, I had a membership system in 2006
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.240]  and it really helped me.
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:12.560]  It helped me get Daring Fireball off the ground
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:16.760]  as a full-time proposition and then Google Reader.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.960]  My shtick was, or not shtick but my,
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:22.600]  the deal was well what do you get as a memberful
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:24.680]  other than the good feelings of supporting me
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:27.060]  was you got full content RSS feeds
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:30.640]  instead of truncated RSS feeds that required you
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:33.360]  to click through to go to my website to read it.
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:37.000]  And then originally I even ginned it up again
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.200]  with one of those special modifications
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:41.120]  to my publishing system.
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  My linked list items went out in that member RSS feed
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.760]  as soon as I hit publish,
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:52.880]  but only hit the website 24 hours later.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.560]  Oh, interesting.
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:56.120]  I don't think I knew that.
[02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:58.360]  Well, it didn't last long
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:02.560]  because I think it was a good idea to get people to pay
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:05.500]  but it drove me nuts because I would post to some things
[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:08.760]  that were timely and how could I post to like what if,
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:10.280]  what if it came out, I don't know,
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.280]  what if I wanted to post to something that was about
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:14.200]  something that was gonna be on TV tonight, you know?
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.360]  I mean, that doesn't happen often,
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:17.240]  but the one thing I never wanted to do
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:20.360]  and I still never want to do is write behind a paywall
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:25.360]  because, and again, I value like an idiot, I guess,
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:30.120]  I'm selfishly more interested in having everybody
[02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:33.040]  freely able to read what I write than make money.
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:36.260]  So even though I almost certainly could make more money
[02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:39.520]  by having some kind of membership system
[02:19:39.520 --> 02:19:42.280]  and putting some of what I write every week behind it
[02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:44.160]  so that you can only read it there,
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:46.080]  I just can't bring myself to do it.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:48.520]  But I thought that the 24 hour delay
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:53.960]  wasn't really a paywall, it was just a delay wall
[02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:56.240]  and I could live with that and when I tried it,
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.160]  I couldn't live with it.
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.880]  I was like, no, I want everybody to see this right away
[02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:02.040]  and then I just made it the full feeds
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:06.440]  and I did a whole talk at Andy's XOXO about how I got here
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:09.640]  but the basic gist was Google Reader killed that
[02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  because Google Reader became the biggest RSS reader by far
[02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:16.860]  and even if you weren't using Google Reader
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.720]  to read your feeds, it became the sync engine
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:21.800]  that you'd use with that news wire
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.400]  and you'd hook it up with your Google Reader to sync
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:26.240]  and Google Reader didn't work
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:28.680]  with password authenticated feeds
[02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:33.460]  or what I did instead of passwords at the HTTP level
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:36.960]  was just give everybody a unique URL
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:39.160]  and tell them not to share it
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:42.060]  but Google Reader was only built for sharing
[02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:45.880]  and it wasn't built for, if I had 10,000 members,
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:48.760]  it wasn't meant for hitting my feed 10,000 times
[02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:52.120]  for each person, Google is a crawler.
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:56.200]  They wanna hit it once and then deliver that one read
[02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:58.460]  to 10,000 readers and what would happen
[02:20:58.460 --> 02:21:00.020]  is everybody would go to Google Reader
[02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:02.840]  and search for Daring Fireball and it would show up,
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:04.120]  A, it was just confusing
[02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:07.120]  because it would show up hundreds and hundreds of feeds
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:11.440]  and B, they all had ugly URLs
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.360]  because they had these unique tokens in them
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:15.440]  and C, they had the full contents
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.760]  so then all these people who weren't paying members
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:22.080]  and I'm sure some of them did it,
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:24.920]  actually did do it deliberately to pirate my feed
[02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:27.020]  so to speak or whatever, bootleg,
[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.920]  I always like to use bootleg instead of pirate,
[02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:30.840]  bootleg my feed without paying
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:33.260]  but most of them were completely innocent, right?
[02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:36.020]  It's they're just looking to subscribe to Daring Fireball,
[02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:39.520]  here's a URL, it has the full content of the site
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:42.300]  so yeah, that's the one I want and they were subscribed
[02:21:42.300 --> 02:21:43.960]  and I was like, oh, that's not gonna work, huh?
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:46.360]  How about I try selling a weekly ad
[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:48.520]  and I'll put that in the RSS feed.
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:52.680]  Well, that worked great and here I am today
[02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:55.560]  still effectively doing it and monetizing that way
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:59.220]  but then at that point, I sort of silently sunsetted
[02:21:59.220 --> 02:22:01.720]  the membership thing, lo and behold,
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:04.680]  a decade later, I look pretty dumb
[02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:08.320]  that I didn't figure out some way to keep it going.
[02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:09.160]  What about you?
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:11.000]  What about you with memberships?
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.460]  What's your history there?
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:16.280]  So I had a membership thing back in 2005
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:20.360]  when I first started doing kotke.org as a full-time thing
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:23.720]  and I did it sort of like a PBS style thing
[02:22:23.720 --> 02:22:27.600]  where it was like a whole pledge drive kind of thing,
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.880]  I had a bunch of things to give away
[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:32.440]  for people who decided to support the site.
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.980]  I had books and I don't know, I had a lot of books,
[02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:37.760]  I can't, I don't know, it's been a long time
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:40.200]  so I can't remember the other stuff that I had
[02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:42.960]  but I had a bunch of like swag to sort of give away.
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:44.120]  Some of the books were like, you know,
[02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:49.120]  like I just like cold emailed Malcolm Gladwell's publisher
[02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.560]  and said, hey, can I get some signed books
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.880]  to give away for this thing and they were like, okay.
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:58.480]  I did that for about a year and after about a year,
[02:22:58.480 --> 02:23:02.360]  I was like, okay, I'm not sure I'm gonna do this again
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.820]  this way because I felt like at the time
[02:23:04.820 --> 02:23:08.680]  that it was this weird pressure that I had put on myself.
[02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:10.280]  I felt like I had about, you know,
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.720]  I think it was about 1500 members I had,
[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:15.960]  maybe a thousand, I can't really remember
[02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:18.800]  but I feel like I had 1500 bosses
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:22.520]  and it was stressing me out and I just, you know,
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:27.240]  and I think it, by that time, like the deck was a thing
[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:30.680]  or was soon to be a thing that you and Jim
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:34.840]  and was it Jason Freed too had come up with?
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:35.680]  Like the three of you?
[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:36.520]  Yeah.
[02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:40.360]  No, the original three were Kudol, Freed and Zeldman.
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:41.200]  I was fourth.
[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.640]  Oh, okay, oh, okay, I see.
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:46.240]  But I remember it very vividly
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.440]  because they were the original three
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:51.440]  and I thought, oh, I wish they would let me in.
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.880]  Yeah, I think for me, it was like,
[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.400]  I wonder if they'd let me in
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:59.300]  but of course, you were like, come on.
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.600]  Were you at the dinner at the Vietnamese place in Austin
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.440]  at South by Southwest the one year?
[02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.840]  Because it was sort of, there used to be a deck dinner.
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:10.680]  That sounds familiar.
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:12.360]  There used to be an annual deck dinner
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:15.320]  at South by Southwest and I was fourth
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:18.440]  and then Jim told me, yeah, we always thought
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:20.760]  if it worked, we'd ask you next.
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:22.000]  The three of them got together.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  I think it was Jason's spitball.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.920]  They thought, let's see if it worked.
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:28.380]  Jim said, I'll take care of the selling.
[02:24:28.380 --> 02:24:31.500]  I know lots of advertisers
[02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:33.540]  and Jim was very, very good at it
[02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:37.000]  and Jim then told me, yeah, but we figured,
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.060]  let's see if it works before we ask Gruber
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:41.880]  and then they got me in and then there was a dinner
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:44.960]  at a Vietnamese restaurant and it was really good
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:46.360]  somewhere in Austin.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.520]  I don't know what year it was
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.520]  but I think Andy got in then and you,
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:55.180]  but it was sort of like, let's expand
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:56.660]  to all the other obvious people
[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:59.080]  who we should have in this thing.
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:02.240]  Yeah, it was around then.
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:04.560]  Because if you went full-time in 2005
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:07.320]  and tried memberships, felt like you had bosses,
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:10.880]  it was probably either 2006 or 2007 in Austin
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:13.580]  where you were added to the deck.
[02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:18.580]  Yeah, exactly, and the deck was like for,
[02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:20.660]  I don't know, for what I wanted to do,
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:22.660]  like the deck just seemed a lot easier
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:27.660]  because it was like, I think it worked this way
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:29.580]  for other people, maybe it didn't, I don't know.
[02:25:29.580 --> 02:25:32.300]  It was basically like a guaranteed amount of money
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:34.600]  every month and like the ad,
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.000]  it was just a little bit of JavaScript
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.540]  and I put it in my sidebar and that was it.
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:41.020]  That was the extent of thinking about the economic
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:43.460]  and financial aspect of my site
[02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:47.340]  and for me, like at the time, like that was fantastic.
[02:25:47.340 --> 02:25:51.540]  I could just write and focus on that
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:53.580]  and not have to worry about anything else.
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:55.100]  And there was no ad tech,
[02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:56.940]  like the little bit of JavaScript
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:01.280]  was literally just to insert like a div tag
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:05.740]  with the image and an a tag and there was never any tracking.
[02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:08.820]  I remember the closest we ever got to tracking
[02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:13.820]  was Adobe wanted to put an invisible pixel gif in
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:15.620]  and we let them.
[02:26:15.620 --> 02:26:17.140]  It was like we put it up to a vote
[02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:18.700]  and we voted okay, that's fine,
[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:21.380]  but that's all it was, was a pixel.
[02:26:21.380 --> 02:26:23.940]  It was no JavaScript, it wasn't setting a cookie.
[02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:26.940]  All they wanted to do is see how many times,
[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:30.340]  instead of the image that was served from the deck.com
[02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:34.220]  or whatever the decknetwork.com or whatever the URL was,
[02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:37.180]  they just wanted to put their own image in with the text
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:39.500]  and just to see how many times they were loaded.
[02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:41.940]  That's the closest we ever got to tracking.
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:46.260]  Yep, it sounds too good to be true.
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:50.420]  It was great, I mean, it was great for publishers
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:52.160]  and I think it was good for readers too,
[02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.240]  because like I think Jim worked really hard
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:56.760]  to keep those ads relevant
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:00.860]  and it was as unobtrusive as you can get
[02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:03.900]  without actually not having an ad.
[02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:05.060]  I would honestly say,
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:06.620]  I still feel that way about my own ads,
[02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.780]  but of course I would say that myself,
[02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:10.760]  but my own ads are clearly just copied
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:11.900]  from the deck blatantly,
[02:27:11.900 --> 02:27:14.540]  but I would say it actually came as close as ads
[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:17.620]  could possibly come to being content that contributes,
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:19.420]  that they were that good sometimes, right?
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:22.500]  I remember, oh crap, what was the stock footage place
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:25.100]  that was a frequent deck advertiser?
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.020]  Oh, like iStockPhoto maybe?
[02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:28.980]  Oh, it was something else, it was better.
[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:29.820]  Veer?
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:31.460]  Yeah, Veer, right?
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:32.760]  Veer. Yeah.
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.820]  Veer, which was made by people who had worked at one
[02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:39.860]  of the earlier stock photo places
[02:27:39.860 --> 02:27:43.860]  from the graphic design era and got,
[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:50.340]  I don't know if they had stock and then it vested
[02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:52.300]  and they were like, okay, let's leave this place
[02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:55.700]  because it's gone to hell and let's do stock photography
[02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:58.640]  and illustration right and made Veer.
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.580]  But their ads, they were just beautiful.
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:02.500]  I was like, this makes my website look better,
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:03.760]  having this ad here.
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:06.180]  Yeah.
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:07.460]  Yeah, so the membership thing,
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:10.500]  so you don't really have anything either right now, right?
[02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:13.540]  Yeah, no, no, no, of course not.
[02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:15.560]  Well, not of course not.
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:16.400]  Yeah, so.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:19.540]  You can't say that, we just had Memberful as the sponsor.
[02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:25.500]  No, no, no, but it's not untoward though.
[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:28.220]  No, it's just because we don't want anything behind,
[02:28:28.220 --> 02:28:29.900]  you know, like Jason Snell's six colors.
[02:28:29.900 --> 02:28:32.420]  It's not like Memberful has made his site any less.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.420]  If you have no idea about the membership part,
[02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:35.700]  it's just that you get extra,
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:38.180]  you get like an extra newsletter at the end of the week
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:40.060]  and there's a Members Only podcast
[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:42.900]  that's different than the free and open podcast that he has.
[02:28:42.900 --> 02:28:46.120]  It's just gating some of the material.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:50.260]  Like Jason and Ben Thompson are sort of at opposite ends,
[02:28:50.260 --> 02:28:53.340]  where most of what Jason and Dan Morin do at Six Colors
[02:28:53.340 --> 02:28:56.900]  is all free and open and unobtrusive and uninterrupted
[02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:58.660]  and then there's a little bit of stuff that you get
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:01.380]  if you're a member and Ben does the opposite
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:02.820]  where there's one weekly article
[02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.580]  that's free for everybody to read
[02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:06.140]  and the other four updates a week
[02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:08.340]  are for the paying subscribers.
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:10.780]  And both work, but both involve putting
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:13.280]  at least something behind a paywall,
[02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:15.960]  which I feel like is, that this is where you and I
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:19.380]  are like, oh, it's complete overlaps on the Venn diagram.
[02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:20.980]  We can't stand having a boss,
[02:29:20.980 --> 02:29:23.380]  we can't stand having 1,500 bosses,
[02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:26.980]  and we kinda don't wanna put anything behind a paywall.
[02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:28.980]  Where by kinda, why by kinda,
[02:29:28.980 --> 02:29:31.820]  I mean, I'd rather pull my fingernails out.
[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:35.940]  Yeah, so several years ago,
[02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:40.940]  I relaunched a membership program with Memberful,
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:45.340]  and I will echo everybody that you seem to know
[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:47.900]  that has Memberful, it's great, I really like it.
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:51.420]  I like how it's lightweight and unobtrusive,
[02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:53.700]  but behind the scenes, there's a lot of different things
[02:29:53.700 --> 02:29:57.180]  you can do to slice and dice things and move stuff around
[02:29:57.180 --> 02:29:59.340]  and administrate and all that sort of stuff.
[02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:00.720]  But so I relaunched the membership,
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:04.380]  and the deal was that people would become members
[02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:09.380]  and they wouldn't get anything different than anybody else.
[02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:14.860]  And so it was, the pitch was basically like katky.org
[02:30:14.980 --> 02:30:16.180]  is the tote bag.
[02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:18.140]  So what you're paying for is the site,
[02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:22.100]  and if the collective readership does not feel
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:23.760]  like this is something worth paying for,
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:27.660]  then the site will probably either cease to exist
[02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:32.660]  or it will exist in a vastly different format or form,
[02:30:32.780 --> 02:30:35.820]  probably like going back to being an occasional thing
[02:30:35.820 --> 02:30:39.360]  that I do while I have other work that I'm pursuing.
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:44.360]  And I didn't really know if that pitch was gonna land or not
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.540]  and it did, like it really kind of resonated
[02:30:47.540 --> 02:30:48.980]  with the readership.
[02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:51.580]  And so this is like year six or,
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:53.900]  I think this is year six of it, maybe seven,
[02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:55.600]  where I've got a paying membership
[02:30:55.600 --> 02:30:58.260]  that is basically like supporting,
[02:30:58.260 --> 02:31:02.660]  at this point it's probably 70 or 80% of my revenue,
[02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:04.720]  I would say, is the membership.
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:07.260]  And everything that I write is in the open.
[02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:10.060]  There's nothing that I publish behind the paywall.
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:13.220]  Right, it's sort of like a one man Wikipedia model.
[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:15.780]  Yeah, kind of.
[02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:16.620]  Which is great.
[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:17.940]  There's different.
[02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:18.780]  No.
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:20.380]  Yeah, I mean, I really like it.
[02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:23.220]  It's sort of that old feeling that I had about 1500 bosses.
[02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:25.220]  I don't feel like that at all now.
[02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:29.820]  I feel like I have thousands of supporters,
[02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:33.260]  people who are like, they really want this to exist.
[02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:35.420]  And it's like, I have a really good feeling about that
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.560]  because it makes me feel good
[02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:38.620]  that people want to read my stuff.
[02:31:38.620 --> 02:31:41.820]  But it's also, I feel a genuine responsibility
[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:45.400]  to keep going on that basis to, I don't know,
[02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:47.940]  to prove that this works.
[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.980]  Like you can publish things to the web
[02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:51.860]  without having paywalls.
[02:31:51.860 --> 02:31:53.880]  And people will support that.
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:56.860]  People want to support other people doing this stuff.
[02:31:56.860 --> 02:32:00.180]  They want to support people keeping things open.
[02:32:00.180 --> 02:32:02.140]  So, I mean, for me, it's been great.
[02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:03.460]  I think if I probably had
[02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:05.620]  a more traditional membership thing,
[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:07.160]  like a substack or something like that,
[02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:10.220]  where it's like, I have a few things a week that are open
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:12.900]  and most everything else is behind the paywall,
[02:32:12.900 --> 02:32:14.920]  I think I would probably be making more money,
[02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:17.880]  but I don't want to.
[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:22.460]  Like, I just don't, I want it to be open.
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:23.880]  I'm right there with you.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:26.540]  All right, so let's talk about the sabbatical.
[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:27.640]  Okay.
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:29.280]  I missed you.
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:30.320]  I really missed.
[02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:31.160]  That's good to hear.
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:33.980]  I missed, I missed, I would,
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:37.160]  and I, you know, you and I are friends.
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:39.320]  We're not in frequent communication.
[02:32:39.320 --> 02:32:41.160]  Maybe we should be, maybe we should be frequent.
[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:43.280]  We should be, we should be frequent texters.
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:44.120]  All right.
[02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:45.840]  But I didn't want to ask you.
[02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:49.480]  I wasn't quite sure why you were taking the sabbatical,
[02:32:49.480 --> 02:32:51.560]  but every week, at some point during the week,
[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:54.980]  I would wonder, is Jason back?
[02:32:54.980 --> 02:32:56.760]  And I would type the K,
[02:32:56.760 --> 02:33:00.220]  and it never stopped auto-filling to kotke.org,
[02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:02.680]  and then I'd look, and it hadn't been updated,
[02:33:02.680 --> 02:33:04.200]  and I'd say, okay, maybe next week,
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:05.360]  and then I'd close the tab.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.200]  Do you want to talk?
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:08.620]  I mean, you've still, you promised your readers,
[02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:11.160]  you promised on Kotke that you'd write extensively
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:13.240]  about your sabbatical, but you still haven't?
[02:33:13.240 --> 02:33:14.400]  Are you still planning to?
[02:33:14.400 --> 02:33:15.240]  Is this?
[02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:17.840]  Are you John Gruber-ing this with something
[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:20.540]  you wanted to write, and it's never going to come out?
[02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:22.600]  I don't know.
[02:33:22.600 --> 02:33:25.820]  I have a lot of notes for this mythical long post
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.880]  about the sabbatical, and there's like some stuff
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:29.100]  that's sort of half written.
[02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:31.840]  It seemed really urgent to me when I got back
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:33.400]  that I wanted to get it all down
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:34.960]  and write about it and stuff.
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:37.940]  I was having a really hard time with it
[02:33:37.940 --> 02:33:40.080]  because there was a lot of it
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:44.520]  that just required some distance from it.
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.240]  I'd just come back, and I think in some ways,
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:50.240]  like there's some of the stuff that happened
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:52.640]  or didn't happen or whatever during the sabbatical
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:54.920]  that just, you know, I just need some time
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:56.440]  to think about it and process it.
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:33:58.240]  You know, I'm still doing that.
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:00.120]  It ended up being seven months.
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:02.080]  I thought maybe it was going to be four to six,
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:05.780]  and it ended up being seven, and yeah.
[02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:09.040]  So the answer is, you know,
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:11.280]  I don't know if I'm going to write it or not.
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.620]  I think part of being on the podcast
[02:34:13.620 --> 02:34:17.640]  was getting a chance to like talk about it a little bit,
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:20.160]  and maybe that will kickstart some interest
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.880]  in things like that, so.
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:22.900]  Well, I'm here for that.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.000]  I did not have the exact date written down
[02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.760]  because I didn't want to,
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:31.160]  but I had a spidey sense of when six months rolled around,
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:34.200]  and when you didn't come back at six months,
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:35.960]  I got a little worried.
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.400]  I never really, I never really,
[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:40.960]  I would have still, to reuse the analogy,
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.940]  I would have bet the house you'd come back,
[02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:45.640]  but maybe after six months,
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:48.620]  I would have started maybe betting the spare bedroom,
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:53.000]  because I got a little, I got a little worried.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:53.900]  Yeah.
[02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:56.800]  So would you want to talk about why you took a sabbatical?
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:34:59.520]  Yeah, I mean,
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:07.680]  yeah, just a lot of years without a break,
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:10.360]  and you know, I'm sure you can empathize with that.
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:11.600]  I've never even had,
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:13.480]  I've never even had a guest writer.
[02:35:14.520 --> 02:35:15.980]  Right, yeah.
[02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:16.820]  So I understand.
[02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:19.260]  No, you're hardcore, you're hardcore.
[02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:22.880]  I think for me, it was like I just felt burned out,
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:25.420]  and I had felt burned out for quite a while,
[02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:27.480]  and there were things in my life
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:30.640]  that just really felt like I was neglecting in a big way
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:32.560]  and really letting slip.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.160]  My kids are both teenagers now,
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:37.200]  and before I know it, they're gonna be gone,
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:39.400]  out of the house, although who knows,
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.640]  maybe they'll be right back.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:44.480]  I know the feeling.
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.300]  Jonas is a freshman in college, and he's in Boston.
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:48.880]  Yeah.
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:50.040]  Oh, wow.
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.640]  Yeah.
[02:35:51.640 --> 02:35:53.240]  So there was an opportunity there
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:55.080]  to spend a little bit more time
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:57.240]  on some other things in my life,
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:01.620]  and you know, being very online for 20, 25 years,
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:07.180]  maybe it's a thing that people shouldn't be doing,
[02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:11.900]  and reading the news and reading Twitter
[02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:14.800]  and being really online and being really on social media,
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:17.300]  I don't know if it's good for people,
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.040]  and I was finding that it just wasn't good for me.
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:23.580]  Like, it didn't feel good.
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:27.680]  It didn't, yeah, I just needed to like,
[02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:29.620]  I think I needed to get away from it.
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.500]  Yeah, so burn, I mean, so long story short, burnout.
[02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:35.040]  Yeah.
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:37.620]  I suspect, and it's one of those things
[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:41.160]  as I've gotten older, and I hopefully have kept
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:44.420]  as open a mind as I could hope for,
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:46.840]  and you know, like I told you before,
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:49.340]  strong ideas loosely help,
[02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:53.940]  and I've changed my stance on all sorts of things
[02:36:53.940 --> 02:36:57.940]  over the years, social stances, almost all,
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:01.540]  or maybe all, to become even more liberal,
[02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:06.020]  more empathetic to other people,
[02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:09.540]  and certainly to more groups of people,
[02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:12.740]  but one thing I've learned,
[02:37:12.740 --> 02:37:15.200]  especially I think in the last 10 years,
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:20.020]  from 40 to 50, part of the wisdom of age is
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:24.500]  that there's an awful lot of things
[02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:27.260]  that I rolled my eyes out in my youth
[02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:32.260]  and thought, ah, you know, what kind of, yeah, it's weak,
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:36.880]  that you just have to experience it to understand it,
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:39.140]  and then when you do experience it,
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:42.380]  every single thing you say about it,
[02:37:42.380 --> 02:37:45.340]  or I would say about it for aspects of my personal life
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:50.340]  or, you know, whatever, all are using the same canards
[02:37:51.300 --> 02:37:54.940]  and things that sound trite and obvious,
[02:37:54.940 --> 02:37:58.700]  and a billion people have said before about the same thing,
[02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:01.080]  but that's because they're true, right,
[02:38:01.080 --> 02:38:04.020]  and that sometimes you just have to experience it,
[02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:05.900]  and then the things you say about it
[02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:08.180]  are the things everybody else has always said about it,
[02:38:08.180 --> 02:38:10.020]  but those are the things that in my youth
[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:11.060]  I rolled my eyes out,
[02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:14.080]  and the concept of burnout is one of them,
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:17.100]  and when, now there's certain examples,
[02:38:17.100 --> 02:38:22.100]  like when NFL coaching is a notoriously long hours job,
[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:26.020]  there's, I think he just got entered
[02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:27.500]  in the Hall of Fame, actually.
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:28.540]  When I was a little kid,
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:29.800]  the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:31.780]  was a guy named Dick Vermeil,
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:36.420]  and he went on, and he wasn't coaching for a while.
[02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:37.780]  He was announcing games,
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:40.060]  and then he came back and coached the St. Louis,
[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:41.640]  I think they were still in St. Louis,
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:43.820]  yeah, the St. Louis Rams to a Super Bowl
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:47.300]  when Kurt Warner was, and he finally won a Super Bowl,
[02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:49.660]  but when he was the coach of the Eagles in 1980,
[02:38:49.660 --> 02:38:52.080]  they went to the Super Bowl and lost to the Raiders,
[02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:54.500]  in 1980, and I think he coached another year or two
[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:57.140]  for the Eagles, and then resigned.
[02:38:57.140 --> 02:39:00.300]  He wasn't fired, he resigned in, quote, burnout,
[02:39:00.300 --> 02:39:02.060]  and he was, in his late 30s,
[02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:06.500]  he was like a prodigy, sort of like a Sean McVeigh,
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:07.740]  like a super young coach.
[02:39:07.740 --> 02:39:09.220]  He looked young, you look at the pictures,
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:11.860]  like he might have been younger than the punter,
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:12.860]  you know what I mean?
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:13.980]  What do you mean he burned out?
[02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:15.420]  How the hell do you burn out as a coach?
[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:17.760]  And then you read, and he was only sleeping
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:19.020]  three or four hours a night,
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:22.220]  and wasn't leaving the stadium, seven days a week,
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:24.140]  he just had a cot in his office,
[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:27.540]  and was sleeping three to four hours a day,
[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:31.300]  and just making game plans and watching film
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:34.340]  of his own team and film of his opposing teams
[02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:37.700]  the whole season, and then in the off-season doing it,
[02:39:37.700 --> 02:39:40.520]  and it's like, okay, then even as somebody
[02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:43.300]  who was skeptical of the concept of burnout,
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:45.420]  I was like, okay, I get that.
[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:47.460]  Three or four hours of sleep a night,
[02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:51.980]  and the other 18 hours all focused on the work
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:54.380]  in a high-pressure public job, okay, I get it.
[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:55.880]  I get how that's not sustainable.
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:57.580]  I'm kind of surprised he lasted as long,
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:00.620]  you know, five years, or four years, or whatever it was.
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:05.580]  It would have been in my youth,
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:07.460]  I would have been very, very skeptical
[02:40:07.460 --> 02:40:09.940]  of Jason Kottke's need for sabbatical.
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:13.320]  No, I would have, I was just being honest.
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:16.720]  And I will say, I don't feel like what I do
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:19.380]  at Daring Fireball, I don't feel like I'm close
[02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:23.260]  or any closer to a burnout than I was 10 years ago
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:24.460]  or 15 years ago.
[02:40:24.460 --> 02:40:26.940]  I also, at this point in my life,
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:29.060]  don't doubt that it could happen,
[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:31.660]  because the one thing I do know from the similarity
[02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:35.980]  of what you and I do is the relentlessness of it, right?
[02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:39.140]  And there are some times where my sight goes quiet
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:40.660]  for three or four days, and that's,
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:42.720]  maybe it's like a mini sabbatical, right?
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:45.020]  There are times where I just, I do feel that.
[02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:47.560]  Because it is, it's relentless, it never stops.
[02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:51.420]  There's always more, the fact like it's good
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:53.820]  in the broad terms that there's always more stuff
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:56.480]  I wanna write about and more stuff I wanna link to
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:59.220]  than I will get around to writing about or linking to.
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:01.580]  It's better than the other way around.
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:04.340]  But on the other hand, it makes it relentless,
[02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:07.420]  because there's never a constant sense
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:09.900]  in the back of my head that I didn't write enough today,
[02:41:09.900 --> 02:41:12.540]  I didn't get to that thing I wanted to link to,
[02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:16.340]  or by the time I get to it, it's too late, it's stale.
[02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:18.500]  I did lend to a thing just yesterday
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:22.000]  about this fantastic investigation Reuters did
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000]  over in Singapore and Indonesia,
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.300]  where there was this scam run by Dow,
[02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:28.340]  can you see me link to it?
[02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:30.740]  It's Dow Chemical said that they were gonna
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:34.220]  take used sneakers in Singapore,
[02:41:34.220 --> 02:41:37.660]  which is like a first nation world,
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:39.300]  and they're gonna take these used sneakers
[02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:42.660]  and turn them into running tracks and playground soft
[02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:47.660]  material for kids, and then Reuters had the wisdom
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:50.220]  to say, hmm, Dow Chemical, not sure I trust them,
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:53.700]  put a bunch of air tags into 11 pairs of sneakers,
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:57.620]  and lo and behold, they're shipped over to Indonesia,
[02:41:57.620 --> 02:41:59.980]  which is more of like a third world country.
[02:41:59.980 --> 02:42:04.380]  So it's literally just publicly greenwashing,
[02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:07.860]  it's Dow saying, hey, plastics and rubbers are great,
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:09.520]  because we take them and reuse them and turn them
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:12.300]  into things like soft mats for playgrounds,
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:15.140]  and in truth, all they were doing was taking garbage
[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:17.700]  from a rich country, Singapore, and dumping it
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:19.980]  into a poor country, Indonesia,
[02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:23.780]  against, explicitly against the laws of Indonesia,
[02:42:23.780 --> 02:42:26.460]  which set up laws for health and safety
[02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:29.820]  about the import of unexpected or unclean used clothing,
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:31.220]  exactly to prevent this.
[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:33.600]  Dow Chemical, you know what I mean?
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:36.420]  But it came out seven days ago,
[02:42:36.420 --> 02:42:38.100]  and somebody sent it to me, and I was like,
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:40.060]  oh, that is perfect fodder for Daring Fireball.
[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:42.820]  I'd be interested in it without the air tags angle,
[02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:44.480]  but combine it with the air tags,
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:46.920]  and I sometimes write about Apple stuff,
[02:42:46.920 --> 02:42:48.340]  it was like, this is perfect.
[02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:50.340]  It took me six days to link to it,
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:52.980]  and I was kinda bummed when I linked to it yesterday,
[02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:54.160]  because I was like, it's kinda stale.
[02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:58.740]  But that's nonstop, that's one example from one post.
[02:42:58.740 --> 02:43:03.220]  Nonstop, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year,
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:07.620]  365 days a year, you know, maybe not 365, right?
[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:11.060]  I got to feel so bad when I go quiet on Christmas Day.
[02:43:11.060 --> 02:43:14.060]  But it's certainly 52 weeks a year,
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:16.500]  every year for 20 years, it is relentless.
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:18.780]  And I could, you know, maybe it's the fact
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:19.920]  that you're five years ahead of me,
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.020]  my sabbatical's coming up in five years.
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:24.580]  Yeah, it could be, it could be.
[02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:26.380]  Well, let me tell you, so-
[02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:27.560]  Yeah, I mean, for me,
[02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:32.660]  for me, there's a couple different things
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:35.700]  that I sort of identified like as problems.
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:40.700]  And one of them is that relentlessness that you mentioned,
[02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:44.060]  where I, especially for my stuff,
[02:43:44.060 --> 02:43:46.020]  which is sort of more sort of general,
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:49.980]  like you have your sort of Apple wheelhouse
[02:43:49.980 --> 02:43:51.300]  and that sort of stuff.
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:55.380]  But like my site is more like just anything interesting.
[02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:57.460]  I mean, your site's a little bit like that, actually.
[02:43:57.460 --> 02:43:59.900]  But like my site, it's like anything that's interesting.
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:02.380]  So it's like, I am always sort of working,
[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:05.060]  because like I am always sort of moving through the world.
[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:06.940]  And so that's an interesting observation,
[02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:09.020]  or this is an interesting little fact thing
[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:11.080]  that I'm talking about with a friend
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:12.340]  or something like that.
[02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:15.660]  So like, there's the sense of like, I am never off work.
[02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:17.900]  And then the other thing is,
[02:44:17.900 --> 02:44:20.580]  what was the other thing I was gonna say?
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:23.060]  Well, I'll just say that before you think about it,
[02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:25.940]  but I describe my site as being like the guy at the gym
[02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:28.380]  who only works his arms, you know?
[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:31.540]  So it's, yeah, I do some, I do my legs a little,
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:33.500]  but it's one, it's lopsided.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:36.580]  It's severely lopsided in the interest of Apple stuff.
[02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:38.300]  But then, you know, like during the Trump years,
[02:44:38.300 --> 02:44:43.300]  I, you know, it semi evolved into the semi-political site
[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:46.420]  that I thought about writing back in 2002,
[02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:49.000]  instead of writing about tech and design.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.860]  Yeah, so the other thing that I remembered
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:55.820]  is that it's the constant feedback that you get on,
[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:57.340]  like every single thing that I write,
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:44:59.440]  there is some little bit of feedback.
[02:44:59.440 --> 02:45:02.040]  Like it's, you know, likes on Twitter or Mastodon,
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.860]  it's people replying, it's emails that I get.
[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:09.220]  And it's sort of this constant judgment coming at you
[02:45:09.220 --> 02:45:12.060]  that for me kind of got to be a problem, I think.
[02:45:12.060 --> 02:45:13.180]  You know, I think over the years,
[02:45:13.180 --> 02:45:15.700]  like you develop a thick skin
[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:17.980]  and it becomes something that you're just like,
[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:20.540]  oh yeah, like people are gonna be angry about this thing.
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.540]  And like, I can judge, like, if I write something,
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:26.660]  like I know what the feedback is already gonna be.
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.980]  Like, and I'm sure you have this too.
[02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:31.160]  Oh, people are gonna try and argue this
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:33.140]  or argue that or whatever.
[02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:34.640]  And I know what the feedback is,
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.680]  but somewhere in the last like four or five, six years,
[02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:42.160]  like that skin like got a lot thinner
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:45.700]  and it started affecting me a lot more.
[02:45:45.700 --> 02:45:47.900]  And I think that that part of the burnout there
[02:45:47.900 --> 02:45:51.060]  was just sort of the subjection of my psyche
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:54.780]  or soul to all of this feedback.
[02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:56.900]  Negative or positive, it doesn't really matter.
[02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:58.580]  It's just feedback.
[02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:00.100]  I don't think it's natural for people
[02:46:00.100 --> 02:46:02.820]  to get that much feedback during a day,
[02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:04.140]  day after day after day.
[02:46:04.140 --> 02:46:05.340]  And I think after a while,
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:07.660]  it just really kind of ground me down, you know?
[02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:08.940]  Hmm.
[02:46:08.940 --> 02:46:12.460]  That's really interesting because I do think,
[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:13.700]  and I've thought about this,
[02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:15.980]  it's something that wasn't obvious to me at the start.
[02:46:15.980 --> 02:46:18.380]  Like when I started, all I wanted to do
[02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:20.460]  is I wanted to be a writer, I wanted to write,
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:22.380]  and I didn't want to answer to anybody
[02:46:22.380 --> 02:46:24.180]  or work my way up any ladder.
[02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:25.880]  And I already knew web technology
[02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:28.100]  and I was already so excited about people like you
[02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:30.340]  and Dave Weiner and all the people we mentioned earlier
[02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:34.140]  and Dean Allen, and I knew that I could do it
[02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:35.580]  and I could do it technically
[02:46:35.580 --> 02:46:37.180]  and I knew that it was, I think,
[02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:38.420]  where I wanted my writing to be
[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.500]  and I just wanted to get it out there.
[02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:44.160]  And it's that ego part of wanting to do stuff in public.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:47.140]  There's no work around it.
[02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:48.820]  You have to have an ego, right?
[02:46:48.820 --> 02:46:51.260]  Nobody runs for political office
[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:53.860]  without some sort of ego and self-centered.
[02:46:53.860 --> 02:46:56.460]  And I've always had that drive to create little things.
[02:46:56.460 --> 02:46:59.300]  I used to, as a little kid, draw little comic strips
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:01.020]  and write stories and just slip them
[02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:02.660]  under my mom's door at night.
[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:04.980]  I just, I've always had a need to make things
[02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:06.580]  for other people to see,
[02:47:06.580 --> 02:47:08.020]  and that's all I really thought about.
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:10.860]  And I didn't think about the thick skin nature
[02:47:10.860 --> 02:47:15.180]  that's required, but I, as I've gone over the years,
[02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:17.500]  I've, especially in the Twitter years
[02:47:17.500 --> 02:47:20.640]  and especially in the late Twitter years
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:23.680]  where Twitter got angry culturally,
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:25.540]  and I don't see how anybody could deny that,
[02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:29.980]  and that's pre-Musk, I realized that,
[02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:32.900]  oh, this is the reason, one of the reasons
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:36.180]  I've been able to keep going and so,
[02:47:36.180 --> 02:47:38.880]  as you and I, me and you, Jason, look around
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:42.140]  and we're like, where the hell is everybody else?
[02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:43.900]  I mean, I really anticipated,
[02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:45.500]  I've said this numerous times,
[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:46.800]  probably the last time you were on,
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:51.200]  I thought in the early days that this was the future
[02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:54.100]  and this is what everybody would be doing.
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:57.360]  I thought there'd be more people doing what we do
[02:47:57.360 --> 02:47:59.460]  because I thought the tools are only gonna get easier
[02:47:59.460 --> 02:48:02.500]  and the fact that me and you and Heather Armstrong
[02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:05.860]  know how to write HTML code
[02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:07.800]  and we know how to design our own stuff
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:11.540]  and we know how to set up something as,
[02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:13.400]  not that setting up movable type was all that hard,
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:15.060]  but it's certainly beyond the kind of most people.
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.340]  There's many, many reasons that you and I
[02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:19.180]  are among the last people standing,
[02:48:19.180 --> 02:48:21.660]  doing this as a full-time job,
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:24.980]  but the thick skin part, I didn't anticipate,
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:26.940]  but I realized in hindsight,
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:31.420]  that somehow came and comes very naturally to me
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:36.420]  and mine hasn't worn thinner and I don't know why.
[02:48:36.900 --> 02:48:40.260]  And I think that might explain the sort of difference there,
[02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:45.260]  but I can imagine there are times where my thick skin,
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:49.580]  somebody, something starts sanding down on it
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:54.580]  and I, yeah, you know, it can get to you.
[02:48:54.860 --> 02:48:56.400]  You know, the one.
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:57.620]  And like I was saying,
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:00.220]  it's not even necessarily negative feedback.
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:01.620]  Like you can get positive feedback
[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:06.460]  and that warps your deal in a whole different way.
[02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:08.540]  Right, no, that's true,
[02:49:08.540 --> 02:49:11.300]  because then it steers you towards writing
[02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:14.500]  for what people want to read,
[02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:16.720]  which isn't necessarily what you should be writing.
[02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:21.720]  I mean, certainly in my racket, in the Apple focused,
[02:49:22.380 --> 02:49:25.300]  hyper-focused part of Daring Fireball,
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:28.620]  the trap to fall into is only writing positive things
[02:49:28.620 --> 02:49:32.140]  about Apple because there are so many people,
[02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:36.060]  so many people out there who do,
[02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:41.060]  their fandom of Apple is sort of dogmatic, religious.
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:42.860]  I don't know how to describe it,
[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:46.780]  but they only want to hear good things about Apple.
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:50.420]  And you can see it on sites that have comments.
[02:49:50.420 --> 02:49:54.420]  I think MacRumors is a great sort of id
[02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:58.840]  of the Apple universe in their comment section,
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:01.980]  where if you read, if you ever look on MacRumors
[02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:04.940]  when there's a story that is more or less,
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:07.380]  or obviously negative about Apple.
[02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:09.180]  So take, for example, last week,
[02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:12.140]  Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen at the Wall Street Journal
[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:14.780]  had a blockbuster story, truly blockbuster story.
[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:15.620]  I won't get into it.
[02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:17.580]  Marco Arman and I talked about it for over an hour
[02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:18.940]  on my last episode of my show.
[02:50:18.940 --> 02:50:22.080]  But the basic gist is if somebody has your iPhone
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:24.240]  and the passcode to the iPhone,
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:27.340]  they not only can access everything on the iPhone,
[02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:29.060]  but they can just go right into settings
[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:30.840]  and change your iCloud password
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:33.140]  without knowing your existing iCloud password.
[02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:35.760]  And then they own your iCloud password too.
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:37.820]  And this is by design, it's not a bug.
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.580]  It's there because so many people
[02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:41.060]  forget their iCloud passwords
[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:42.580]  that it's built in as a feature.
[02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:44.460]  And Google does the same thing with Android.
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:46.080]  And I proved it with my Android phone.
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:49.180]  But that's obviously a negative story about Apple.
[02:50:49.180 --> 02:50:51.100]  The fact that, and thieves have picked,
[02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:54.020]  the Joanna Stern and Nicole story
[02:50:54.020 --> 02:50:56.400]  was about the fact that thieves have picked this up
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:59.140]  and they're snooping people's passcodes in bars.
[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:00.420]  And then when they steal their phone,
[02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:02.260]  they've already got their passcode.
[02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:04.520]  And then they steal this and they use it
[02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:07.340]  and take money out of their Venmos and their bank accounts.
[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:10.100]  And they open up Apple cards and quick charge things.
[02:51:10.100 --> 02:51:11.640]  And people don't even know.
[02:51:11.640 --> 02:51:12.820]  And the worst part is the victims
[02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:14.020]  don't even know what the hell goes on.
[02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:15.680]  All they know is they lost their phone.
[02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:16.820]  They lost their phone.
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:20.420]  And next thing you know, they can't even get into iCloud
[02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:22.100]  when they get home on their MacBook.
[02:51:22.100 --> 02:51:24.740]  What the hell, I can't get, why can't I get into iCloud?
[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:26.980]  And next thing you know, they're getting emails
[02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:30.980]  from their bank saying that they lost $10,000, blah, blah, blah.
[02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:33.180]  If you read the MacRumors story
[02:51:33.180 --> 02:51:35.260]  that linked to and summarized that story,
[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:37.940]  you'll find people in the comments who will defend Apple.
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:40.060]  And again, there is a defensible angle here
[02:51:40.060 --> 02:51:42.700]  on the customer support, but you'll find these people
[02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:44.740]  who are angry that this article was posted
[02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:46.420]  in the first place, right?
[02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:49.860]  And an awful lot of Apple sites, not ones I've read,
[02:51:49.860 --> 02:51:52.780]  but, and especially Apple sites that have come and gone,
[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:55.960]  because also I think that catering to that crowd
[02:51:55.960 --> 02:51:58.000]  makes it unsustainable, right?
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.260]  You're not gonna last if you're trying to do that.
[02:52:00.260 --> 02:52:03.860]  Although I guess Fox News has made it work, but you don't,
[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:06.020]  that's a perfect example, right?
[02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:07.600]  You don't wanna be the Fox News.
[02:52:07.600 --> 02:52:10.740]  Nobody should be the Fox News of anything, right?
[02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:12.240]  Fox News shouldn't be the Fox News
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:14.100]  of conservative US politics,
[02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:16.700]  but there've been an awful lot of Apple-oriented sites
[02:52:16.700 --> 02:52:18.420]  over the years that are,
[02:52:18.420 --> 02:52:21.480]  they're certainly not detrimental to democracy.
[02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:27.500]  Yeah, but it's not a healthy way to do things, right?
[02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:29.740]  And in that feedback cycle,
[02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:34.140]  even if you don't have a central theme or topic
[02:52:34.140 --> 02:52:36.700]  other than the general interest of modern life
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:39.980]  and art and whatever you wanna say,
[02:52:39.980 --> 02:52:41.180]  you're right though, I could see it.
[02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:44.820]  It's not healthy to be getting the sort of ding, ding, ding,
[02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:48.220]  you know, there is like a sort of gamification
[02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:50.380]  and slot machine, you know,
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:52.420]  oh, they make these dings really pleasant
[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:53.960]  and they're all at a pitch, you know,
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:56.580]  that has been studied to be like pleasant to the human,
[02:52:56.580 --> 02:52:59.820]  you know, every single little thing about a slot machine
[02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:03.020]  is designed to keep you doing it, right?
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:04.100]  Yep, yep.
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:07.060]  All right, so tell me about during the sabbatical.
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:09.380]  See, here's the thing I don't understand
[02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:12.580]  is you knew you were gonna take three or four months,
[02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:14.780]  but didn't I, as I thought about it,
[02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:16.460]  it's like, well, what happens like one month in
[02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:18.660]  when you are reading something, right?
[02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:20.480]  You still read some stuff on the web,
[02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:21.860]  or did you, you didn't like-
[02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:22.700]  No.
[02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:23.700]  You didn't read anything?
[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:25.260]  You, Ted Kaczynski did?
[02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:28.940]  I basically, basically for seven months,
[02:53:28.940 --> 02:53:33.220]  I probably read no more than 10 articles on the web.
[02:53:33.220 --> 02:53:36.660]  Huh, well then that answers my question,
[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:38.880]  which is how could you possibly resist linking
[02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:39.840]  to something that you read
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:41.960]  that you felt like you had to link to?
[02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:43.060]  You just didn't read it.
[02:53:43.060 --> 02:53:45.260]  No, I just didn't read it.
[02:53:46.260 --> 02:53:50.780]  John, the extent to which I dropped doing the website
[02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:54.420]  like a hot potato would like just astound you,
[02:53:54.420 --> 02:53:58.660]  like it was gone, it was just gone.
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:01.700]  And I, because I knew that that's the way it had to be,
[02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:05.460]  like I knew I just needed to completely set it down.
[02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:08.100]  I read books instead, I kept up with Instagram,
[02:54:08.100 --> 02:54:09.540]  I completely dropped Twitter,
[02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:12.120]  and actually I haven't really picked Twitter back up again,
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:14.740]  even since then, I-
[02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:16.100]  Are you mastadonning now?
[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:17.540]  You're mastadonning.
[02:54:17.540 --> 02:54:19.340]  I am, I am mastadonning, yeah.
[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:21.100]  Mastadonning is interesting, I like it.
[02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:23.640]  It's, you know, it reminds me a little bit of Twitter
[02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:26.060]  in the earlier days, but also of a sort
[02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:28.900]  of a different thing, yeah.
[02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:31.720]  That's fascinating.
[02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:35.460]  And it really, seriously, it was my single biggest,
[02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:38.900]  I mean, here we are three hours, 20 minutes into this.
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:41.100]  And it's honestly, the whole reason I wanted
[02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:43.160]  to have you on the show is how did you not link to,
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:45.940]  how did you not break the sabbatical to link to something?
[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:47.500]  Because I don't think, that's the thing
[02:54:47.500 --> 02:54:49.540]  I don't think I could do.
[02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:53.880]  But I guess I could do it if I completely unplugged, right?
[02:54:53.880 --> 02:54:56.980]  Yeah, I mean, there were, I think there were a handful
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:54:58.380]  of things that I did.
[02:54:58.380 --> 02:55:00.020]  There were a few quick links,
[02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:03.260]  like maybe three, four that I linked to.
[02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:04.800]  I can't even remember what they were now,
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:06.280]  but it seemed like the type of thing it was like,
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:08.140]  oh, okay, I'm just gonna post this one thing
[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:10.740]  and then, you know, put it back down.
[02:55:10.740 --> 02:55:13.640]  And then I made a post like in October,
[02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:16.480]  because like you, people were getting a little bit antsy
[02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:18.260]  about, hey, are you coming back?
[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:19.100]  What's going on?
[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:20.220]  So I just kind of made a post.
[02:55:20.220 --> 02:55:21.980]  I'm like, I'm not back yet.
[02:55:21.980 --> 02:55:23.980]  I will be back at some point.
[02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:26.260]  And, you know, I think your guess was correct.
[02:55:26.260 --> 02:55:27.980]  I don't think there was any,
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:31.020]  I don't think I ever seriously entertained not coming back.
[02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.540]  I was always gonna come back,
[02:55:32.540 --> 02:55:33.820]  but it was just a matter of like,
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:37.020]  I just, I really just need to decompress completely
[02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:41.620]  from this so that I can start with not quite a blank slate,
[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:43.880]  but somewhere in the ballpark of that.
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:45.520]  Do you feel rejuvenated?
[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:47.860]  I did when I came back.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:50.180]  It's a couple, let's see, it's three months,
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:51.020]  three months into it,
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:54.020]  because I think I started at the beginning of November.
[02:55:54.020 --> 02:55:57.540]  The winter has been like we started at three hours ago,
[02:55:57.540 --> 02:55:59.420]  three and a half hours ago, whenever the hell it was.
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:01.280]  Yesterday, you know, like winters are hard.
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:02.840]  Yeah, exactly, yesterday.
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:03.940]  Winters are tough for me.
[02:56:03.940 --> 02:56:07.300]  And like this winter has been more tough than usual
[02:56:07.300 --> 02:56:09.940]  just because of, there's a lot of family
[02:56:09.940 --> 02:56:11.580]  sort of stuff going on
[02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:13.860]  that I don't really care to talk about,
[02:56:13.860 --> 02:56:16.740]  but there's a lot of going on, a lot of going on.
[02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:20.180]  And I did not really get the opportunity
[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:24.460]  to sort of come back and really think about
[02:56:24.460 --> 02:56:27.740]  like how I want to do this differently going forward.
[02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:30.500]  I kind of fell back into old kind of ruts
[02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:31.500]  and old kind of habits.
[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.820]  So, you know, three months down the road here,
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:37.180]  I am not burned out by any stretch of the imagination,
[02:56:37.180 --> 02:56:38.540]  but I am like, crap,
[02:56:38.540 --> 02:56:41.580]  I see that stuff coming in the rear view mirror
[02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:43.380]  like sooner than I thought I would.
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:47.100]  And hopefully things are starting to even out
[02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:49.780]  and level out in my life right now
[02:56:49.780 --> 02:56:53.900]  so that I can spend some more time focusing on that stuff.
[02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:56.780]  It's focusing on work, focusing on the site,
[02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:58.740]  what not only like writing the site,
[02:56:58.740 --> 02:57:00.900]  but like how I might want to go about it differently
[02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:03.620]  in order to make it more sustainable.
[02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:06.580]  Because at this point I want to hit 30,
[02:57:06.580 --> 02:57:09.960]  I want to hit 35, 40, who knows?
[02:57:09.960 --> 02:57:11.700]  But like, I want to keep it going
[02:57:11.700 --> 02:57:13.200]  and I want to keep myself going.
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:16.460]  I don't want to be, you know, 55, 60 years old
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:18.380]  and I am a husk of a human being.
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:21.220]  And, but God, he had a great website, you know,
[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:24.380]  like that, I don't think that's a very good trade off
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:27.100]  for me or for the world or for anybody.
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:31.780]  So I got to try and figure it out, so.
[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:32.940]  Before I forget, I did,
[02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:34.860]  I don't want to let your homework go to waste.
[02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:38.300]  I asked you, it's minimal homework for the show,
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.260]  how many posts you've posted to kotke.org over the years?
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:43.180]  And the answer is?
[02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:44.420]  About 40,000.
[02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:45.860]  All right, so 40,000.
[02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:49.380]  And again, this speaks to the relentlessness
[02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:52.120]  and the sort of body of work.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.340]  So my count is 32,000-ish.
[02:57:56.340 --> 02:57:58.700]  And that's not counting like the sponsor ads,
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:00.500]  which I technically go through movable type,
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:02.260]  but it's, I'm subtracting.
[02:58:02.260 --> 02:58:05.160]  Which is fascinating because you're at 25 years
[02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:08.340]  and I'm at 20 and that 32 to 40
[02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:11.380]  is pretty much exactly the same ratio.
[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:13.980]  It's kind of freaky.
[02:58:13.980 --> 02:58:15.660]  It's a lot, you know.
[02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:19.220]  Five years ago, I did a word count.
[02:58:19.220 --> 02:58:21.380]  It is not, that's not easy to do,
[02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:24.860]  or it's not hard, but there's no automatic feature
[02:58:24.860 --> 02:58:26.460]  in movable type to do it.
[02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:30.580]  I like did an, I did an export to like a single file,
[02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:32.740]  or I forget how, I think that's how it works,
[02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:33.580]  which is crazy.
[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:36.520]  It's like, but you know, computers are very, you know.
[02:58:36.520 --> 02:58:38.340]  It's one of those things that you,
[02:58:38.340 --> 02:58:42.800]  my broken, grew up in the 80s and 90s mind thinks,
[02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:45.780]  well, you can't export all of that to one text file,
[02:58:45.780 --> 02:58:47.940]  but of course you can, and it's not even.
[02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:48.780]  It won't fit.
[02:58:48.780 --> 02:58:51.540]  It'll fit, and it doesn't take that long.
[02:58:51.540 --> 02:58:56.000]  But I wrote like a script and it omitted my block quotes,
[02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:57.460]  which are extensive at times,
[02:58:57.460 --> 02:59:00.180]  and so it was only counting original words.
[02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:01.980]  I forget if I counted my headlines or not.
[02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:06.020]  I think I didn't because a lot of the times I lazy out
[02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:09.180]  and just use the other site's headline as my headline.
[02:59:09.180 --> 02:59:11.940]  You know, Wall Street Journal colon,
[02:59:11.940 --> 02:59:13.440]  just publish their headline.
[02:59:13.440 --> 02:59:15.740]  So just counting my words, I forget where I was at,
[02:59:15.740 --> 02:59:19.460]  but it was either a million or two million words
[02:59:19.460 --> 02:59:20.500]  of original writing.
[02:59:20.500 --> 02:59:22.340]  My word count might be higher,
[02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:24.500]  probably is higher than yours on average,
[02:59:24.500 --> 02:59:29.440]  but maybe not as far ahead as you think, though,
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:32.280]  but it's the post, though, that counts.
[02:59:32.280 --> 02:59:35.000]  Like, okay, I'm gonna send this to all the people
[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:35.840]  who read my site,
[02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:37.820]  and there's a certain responsibility for that,
[02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:42.500]  and it's uncanny how similar the pace we're on is.
[02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:43.920]  That's weird, that's weird.
[02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:44.760]  I noticed.
[02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:47.660]  It's also weird that both of us write
[02:59:47.660 --> 02:59:52.380]  several books a year worth of words every year,
[02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:55.820]  but yeah, that's, yeah.
[02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:59.120]  But I feel like I couldn't sit down and write a book.
[02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:00.220]  I don't think so either.
[03:00:00.220 --> 03:00:04.300]  I could, I guess, I've often said,
[03:00:04.300 --> 03:00:06.500]  theory, I could do a collection,
[03:00:06.500 --> 03:00:08.900]  although I would probably pay someone else
[03:00:08.900 --> 03:00:10.500]  to pick the ones to choose
[03:00:10.500 --> 03:00:11.980]  because I don't know that I'm the right person
[03:00:11.980 --> 03:00:13.980]  to choose them, but that's not writing a book.
[03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:15.580]  A collection of the greatest hits
[03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:17.660]  of Daring Fireball with commentary.
[03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:19.500]  I mean, it's a book, it is a book,
[03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:21.940]  but it's not writing a book, right?
[03:00:21.940 --> 03:00:25.900]  I mean, it honestly feels to me like,
[03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:28.980]  I don't know, telling me to put together an airplane,
[03:00:28.980 --> 03:00:30.500]  or fix an airplane.
[03:00:30.500 --> 03:00:32.180]  This airplane doesn't start, what do you do?
[03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:33.020]  I don't know.
[03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:36.220]  I mean, I write every day, and like you said,
[03:00:36.220 --> 03:00:39.500]  we write books' lengths of words every year,
[03:00:39.500 --> 03:00:44.500]  but to sit down and write one 60,000 word plus narrative,
[03:00:45.500 --> 03:00:48.180]  it's not the way my brain works.
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:52.340]  It's, I feel like I found the medium for my writing brain.
[03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:54.640]  I often wonder, here's a question for you.
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:57.300]  I wonder what I would do
[03:00:57.300 --> 03:01:01.780]  if I had been born a generation earlier, you know, pre-wet.
[03:01:01.780 --> 03:01:04.580]  Because I absolutely, I can't help but think
[03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:06.700]  I'd have had the itch to write,
[03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:09.820]  and I probably still would have gone to the student
[03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:14.060]  newspaper at whatever college I would have gone to,
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:16.360]  born 25 or 30 years earlier.
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:18.540]  But I don't know what I would have done afterwards.
[03:01:18.540 --> 03:01:19.420]  I really don't.
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:23.100]  I think I would have wanted to be a writer.
[03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:23.940]  I don't know, though.
[03:01:23.940 --> 03:01:25.920]  I may not, I don't know.
[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:30.360]  I might be doing something else, and in the back of my head,
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:32.300]  gone to my grave with a regret.
[03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:34.780]  Boy, you know, maybe next year I'll try writing a book,
[03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:37.500]  or writing something, or something, and never doing it.
[03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:38.940]  I don't know, I don't know what I,
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:42.260]  honest to God, don't know what I would do other than this.
[03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:44.460]  Nothing else I don't think would have stuck.
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:46.700]  And-
[03:01:46.700 --> 03:01:49.500]  Yeah, I'm not sure that I would be a writer,
[03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:54.500]  because for me, the attraction of it initially, certainly,
[03:01:55.380 --> 03:01:57.060]  and I think still to some extent,
[03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:59.220]  is like that it's writing on the web,
[03:01:59.220 --> 03:02:01.420]  and it's not only writing,
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:04.300]  but there's this curating part of it too
[03:02:04.300 --> 03:02:07.220]  that I really focus on.
[03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:10.740]  I was gonna be a scientist before I decided to pivot
[03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:14.000]  to trying to figure out how to make a living on the web.
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:14.920]  I went to grad school,
[03:02:14.920 --> 03:02:17.860]  I was gonna get a PhD in ceramic engineering.
[03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:21.180]  Yeah.
[03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:22.500]  I don't know why, I'm not laughing.
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:25.860]  Like making, like making gorilla glass, maybe, you know?
[03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:26.980]  I don't know.
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:28.340]  I'm not laughing at the field.
[03:02:28.340 --> 03:02:29.660]  I actually think it's fascinating,
[03:02:29.660 --> 03:02:32.420]  and I just was bitching on Mastodon yesterday,
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:34.340]  because I cracked the back of my iPhone
[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:35.680]  for the second year of a row,
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:38.660]  that I cannot believe we make these things out of glass,
[03:02:38.660 --> 03:02:41.260]  which is the dumbest material you could possibly
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:42.220]  make them out of.
[03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:44.780]  And so I hope there's some ceramic engineer out there,
[03:02:44.780 --> 03:02:47.580]  literally a ceramic engineer who's got an idea
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:49.540]  for a ceramic that won't crack,
[03:02:49.540 --> 03:02:52.460]  but will pass through the pass-through charging,
[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:54.660]  which is why they shifted to glass in the first place.
[03:02:54.660 --> 03:02:57.380]  So I'm not laughing at the field of ceramic engineering.
[03:02:57.380 --> 03:03:01.900]  I think it's as essential and as bright a future as ever.
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:04.340]  I'm just laughing at the idea of, you know,
[03:03:04.340 --> 03:03:08.300]  missing you as a voice in my life on a daily basis
[03:03:08.300 --> 03:03:09.980]  while you're out there baking
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:13.820]  the seventh generation gorilla glass in an oven.
[03:03:14.980 --> 03:03:16.580]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:18.060]  Before we go, I mean, we've gone too long,
[03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:19.580]  but I have noticed, though,
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:22.380]  I mean, to circle back to design and stuff like that,
[03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:25.120]  that you've subtly, not redesigned,
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:29.300]  but tweaked the Kottke layout where your,
[03:03:29.300 --> 03:03:31.040]  what you call quick links,
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:33.340]  instead of, for a couple of years,
[03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:37.180]  what you were doing was sort of batching them up.
[03:03:37.180 --> 03:03:39.060]  I don't know if they were by the day
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:40.980]  or how were you doing that?
[03:03:40.980 --> 03:03:44.500]  You'd sort of put them in a multi-column pool
[03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:46.900]  in between true posts.
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:49.740]  Like you'd have post, post,
[03:03:49.740 --> 03:03:52.260]  and then a collection of quick links
[03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:56.460]  in a multi-column tag pool,
[03:03:56.460 --> 03:03:58.740]  then a post, a post,
[03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:01.140]  and then another, you know, quick link collection
[03:04:01.140 --> 03:04:02.180]  from earlier.
[03:04:02.180 --> 03:04:04.580]  Like how, I never quite discerned,
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:09.900]  I figure knowing you, it was probably hand pooled.
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:12.620]  This is enough to tie off as one pool
[03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:13.860]  and I'll move on to the next,
[03:04:13.860 --> 03:04:15.780]  or was it automated in some way?
[03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:20.020]  So it works slightly differently on the website
[03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:21.900]  and in RSS.
[03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:24.700]  So on the website, there was one main post,
[03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:26.860]  and then under that first main post,
[03:04:26.860 --> 03:04:28.620]  there was a quick link section.
[03:04:28.620 --> 03:04:30.980]  And that was just the last 10 quick links,
[03:04:30.980 --> 03:04:32.660]  like reverse chronological.
[03:04:32.660 --> 03:04:34.340]  And then there was a button to,
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:36.000]  you could click into like the main
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.920]  sort of quick links archive.
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:41.660]  But for RSS, what I did was every few hours,
[03:04:41.660 --> 03:04:43.260]  if there were two or more quick links,
[03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:45.820]  I would bundle those up and send them to RSS.
[03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:48.260]  Manually or automated?
[03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:52.340]  Automated, it was all like cron jobs and PHP scripts.
[03:04:52.340 --> 03:04:54.420]  And PHP, I was gonna ask what language.
[03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:57.540]  Yeah, you've unbundled that on the website
[03:04:57.540 --> 03:05:01.340]  and now the website is just purely reverse chronological.
[03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:02.180]  When did that happen?
[03:05:02.180 --> 03:05:03.880]  I don't think I noticed when that happened.
[03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:06.120]  Probably, I don't know, a month, month and a half
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:07.780]  after I got back from my sabbatical.
[03:05:07.780 --> 03:05:10.380]  So end of December, maybe sometime in January.
[03:05:10.380 --> 03:05:12.340]  I think it was probably sometime in January.
[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:13.860]  I like it, I like it.
[03:05:13.860 --> 03:05:14.980]  There's a vector here.
[03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:16.540]  I feel like I'm moving towards something.
[03:05:16.540 --> 03:05:19.060]  Like the way that the quick links worked,
[03:05:19.060 --> 03:05:20.520]  it was getting a little long in the tooth
[03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:22.500]  and I wanted to move away from that.
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.980]  And because I feel like I'm putting
[03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:26.580]  a little bit more energy these days
[03:05:26.580 --> 03:05:28.540]  into the quick links, there's more of them
[03:05:28.540 --> 03:05:30.460]  than there used to be and they're more frequent.
[03:05:30.460 --> 03:05:33.220]  I wanted to highlight them more on the front page
[03:05:33.220 --> 03:05:34.120]  than they had been.
[03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:36.340]  So that was kind of the impetus there.
[03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:37.180]  I like it.
[03:05:37.180 --> 03:05:40.760]  I will just say, A, I like the change.
[03:05:40.760 --> 03:05:42.660]  And I think it, I don't know why.
[03:05:42.660 --> 03:05:46.540]  I don't know, it just, it's in my ears, not my eyes.
[03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:50.220]  It just reads better to me and it reads more like you.
[03:05:50.220 --> 03:05:53.020]  And I don't know if it's coincident or not.
[03:05:53.020 --> 03:05:57.380]  I just feel like when, my sense as a reader
[03:05:57.380 --> 03:05:59.640]  is that when you came back from sabbatical,
[03:05:59.640 --> 03:06:01.180]  you needed to warm up a little.
[03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:05.740]  I don't, I was so happy when you came back
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:08.760]  and it was great and it was, you were back,
[03:06:08.760 --> 03:06:13.520]  but I honestly feel like it's more recently.
[03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:18.140]  Let's just say it's in 2023, like post-New Year,
[03:06:18.140 --> 03:06:21.660]  there are more stretches of kotke.org
[03:06:21.660 --> 03:06:26.380]  where I have to close the tab because it's,
[03:06:26.380 --> 03:06:31.180]  I've already ruined half my day with the links
[03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:33.680]  and I'm not even caught up yet.
[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:38.680]  And it's so crack for my, this is all,
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:41.660]  God damn it, the next very, the next one too,
[03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:46.300]  son of a bitch, you know, like a hitting streak.
[03:06:46.300 --> 03:06:50.220]  But there's a famous story, I forget who had it,
[03:06:50.220 --> 03:06:51.860]  but there was the famous year, yeah,
[03:06:51.860 --> 03:06:55.860]  it's the famous year where Ted Williams hit 400
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:59.500]  and Joe DiMaggio had the 56 game hitting streak in baseball.
[03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:01.460]  I forget which year, I should,
[03:07:01.460 --> 03:07:03.340]  the fact that I know most of this, but not which year,
[03:07:03.340 --> 03:07:07.180]  but that's bizarre, A, that there's these two freakish
[03:07:07.180 --> 03:07:11.020]  stats in baseball, Ted Williams, last guy to hit 400,
[03:07:11.020 --> 03:07:13.440]  Joe DiMaggio has a 56 game hitting streak.
[03:07:13.440 --> 03:07:15.540]  In other words, for people who aren't baseball fans,
[03:07:15.540 --> 03:07:18.740]  56 games in a row, he got at least one hit.
[03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:21.420]  But the most amazing stat of that season
[03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:23.700]  was at some point in the middle of the year,
[03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:25.660]  and I don't know the number, but Ted Williams
[03:07:25.660 --> 03:07:30.060]  had something like 14 or 15 consecutive at bats with a hit,
[03:07:30.060 --> 03:07:34.100]  which is, let's say you're hitting 400,
[03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:36.320]  so it's a little bit less than a coin flip,
[03:07:36.320 --> 03:07:39.820]  it's less than a coin flip, but like 14 or 15,
[03:07:39.820 --> 03:07:42.320]  or I forget what the number is, but it was freakish.
[03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:45.420]  But that's what, Kotke's been on, to me,
[03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:46.540]  and I'm not just buttering you up
[03:07:46.540 --> 03:07:48.980]  because you've been so generous with your time on my show,
[03:07:48.980 --> 03:07:51.220]  but you've had more streaks like that,
[03:07:51.220 --> 03:07:53.940]  where it's not just every day you've got something
[03:07:53.940 --> 03:07:55.580]  that I think is gold and I'm jealous
[03:07:55.580 --> 03:07:57.780]  that I'm not the one who found it first and linked to it,
[03:07:57.780 --> 03:08:01.300]  but post, post, quick link, post,
[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:03.340]  son of a bitch, every single one of these
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:08.340]  is a feature length article, or a 15 minute YouTube,
[03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:10.980]  or a thing, and post, post, post, post,
[03:08:10.980 --> 03:08:14.340]  all right in my wheelhouse, crack cocaine
[03:08:14.340 --> 03:08:17.300]  for my information-addled, bored mind.
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:21.100]  And that, to me, and you've been doing this for 25 years,
[03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:25.160]  to me, but I feel like you've had more of those stretches
[03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:28.540]  of at-bat, post, post, post, that are all gold
[03:08:28.540 --> 03:08:31.640]  in the new year than November, December,
[03:08:31.640 --> 03:08:33.780]  and maybe that's just me, I don't know.
[03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:37.100]  What's your self-perception of coming back?
[03:08:37.100 --> 03:08:38.980]  Do you feel like you needed to warm up,
[03:08:38.980 --> 03:08:41.560]  or were you right back in the saddle?
[03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:44.840]  No, I mean, it took me a while to warm up.
[03:08:44.840 --> 03:08:46.560]  My kids and I have this joke about
[03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:48.680]  if we're watching a show together or whatever,
[03:08:48.680 --> 03:08:51.500]  and we take a little break,
[03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:53.480]  and we'll come back to it after a week,
[03:08:53.480 --> 03:08:54.840]  and I'll turn it on,
[03:08:54.840 --> 03:08:56.560]  and while I'm finding the show or whatever,
[03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:59.000]  I'm like, okay, so what's the show about again?
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.240]  And they're like, ugh.
[03:09:01.240 --> 03:09:02.880]  But I really felt like coming back,
[03:09:02.880 --> 03:09:04.360]  I was like, how do I do this again?
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:06.360]  Okay, so I have to do this and this,
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:08.280]  and yeah, it definitely took me a while.
[03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:10.880]  I think January, I think you're right
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:11.760]  about the timing.
[03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:13.280]  It's like January,
[03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:15.360]  I felt like I got back into the groove again.
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:18.520]  I had more time in January than I did in December.
[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:21.600]  December was a little bit busy with family
[03:09:21.600 --> 03:09:23.720]  and some travel and stuff like that,
[03:09:23.720 --> 03:09:26.640]  and January, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:28.400]  And then January, I actually had some time
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:31.600]  to stretch and crack my fingers
[03:09:31.600 --> 03:09:33.760]  and really get involved.
[03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:38.620]  So I'm glad that's resonating at least with one person.
[03:09:38.620 --> 03:09:39.460]  Well, it's good.
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:41.760]  Yeah, it definitely took a while to get going.
[03:09:43.480 --> 03:09:46.880]  I hope it didn't come across as a backhanded compliment,
[03:09:46.880 --> 03:09:49.120]  because it was good when it came back.
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:52.840]  But to me, and again, to go back to the Ted Williams,
[03:09:52.840 --> 03:09:54.560]  well, actually, I think that's a bad analogy.
[03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:56.440]  I was gonna say, to go back to Ted Williams,
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:58.420]  I was gonna say it's like when he left
[03:09:58.420 --> 03:09:59.980]  Banger League Baseball to go fly
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:02.480]  fighter pilot missions in Korea,
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:04.080]  which is bananas, right?
[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:07.880]  Imagine if Mike Trout left the Major League Baseball now
[03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:11.400]  to go fly an airplane in a dangerous war zone
[03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:13.880]  for a couple of years and then came back.
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:15.720]  But I actually think when Ted Williams came back,
[03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:18.020]  he actually started hitting great right away.
[03:10:18.020 --> 03:10:20.120]  But, yeah, he did.
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:22.280]  So forget that analogy.
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:24.380]  Ted Williams is a better baseball player
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:26.720]  than I am a blogger, I can live with that.
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:27.960]  I don't know, I don't know.
[03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:30.840]  Well, I didn't mean it as a backhanded compliment,
[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:34.520]  but it seems to me like you agree in hindsight.
[03:10:34.520 --> 03:10:35.820]  It's just sometimes it's hard
[03:10:35.820 --> 03:10:37.240]  when you're the person creating it
[03:10:37.240 --> 03:10:38.960]  to have that sort of perspective.
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:40.360]  That's the end of my questions.
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:42.960]  I don't know, I mean, do you have any questions?
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:45.040]  I mean, do you have anything else you wanted to get to?
[03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:48.300]  I mean, it seems, you know, probably gone on long enough.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:52.280]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think three hours
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:54.480]  and how many ever minutes we've got going here
[03:10:54.480 --> 03:10:56.480]  is probably good.
[03:10:56.480 --> 03:10:58.560]  I have actually, I gotta go pick up my kids
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:10:59.400]  in like 20 minutes.
[03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:00.220]  All right.
[03:11:00.220 --> 03:11:05.220]  Well, to say that I am appreciative of your time
[03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:08.140]  to sit here and do this at this length with me.
[03:11:08.140 --> 03:11:08.980]  I mean, this is funny
[03:11:08.980 --> 03:11:12.740]  because we ostensibly originally had a hard stop
[03:11:12.740 --> 03:11:14.780]  90 minutes ago and you told me.
[03:11:14.780 --> 03:11:15.620]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:11:15.620 --> 03:11:17.180]  We don't have that hard stop anymore,
[03:11:17.180 --> 03:11:20.280]  so if we're on a roll, we can keep going.
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:22.260]  Well, I feel like we were on a roll
[03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:23.660]  and I appreciate it greatly.
[03:11:23.660 --> 03:11:25.700]  This is my favorite episode of the show
[03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:27.280]  that I've done in a very long time.
[03:11:27.280 --> 03:11:29.520]  No offense to any other guests
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:32.060]  who've been on my show recently.
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:32.900]  I love you all.
[03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:33.740]  I love you all.
[03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:35.300]  Fuck them, fuck them.
[03:11:35.300 --> 03:11:36.900]  Whatever.
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:39.220]  Needless to say, I think at this point,
[03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:41.820]  I don't know that I need to repeat your URL
[03:11:43.140 --> 03:11:45.880]  for people looking to find your,
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:49.020]  find iPertext products, but it is at kotke.org
[03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:51.980]  and on Mastodon, you know what,
[03:11:51.980 --> 03:11:53.180]  instead of giving addresses,
[03:11:53.180 --> 03:11:54.020]  cause it's, I don't know,
[03:11:54.020 --> 03:11:56.100]  it's like at kotke, at mastodon.social
[03:11:56.100 --> 03:11:58.140]  or I don't know which instance you're on.
[03:11:58.140 --> 03:12:01.000]  You know, I said to Marco Orman on the last episode,
[03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:02.580]  it's better, you know what, on Mastodon,
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:04.100]  just use your favorite Mastodon client
[03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:06.460]  and search for Kotke and you'll find both Jason
[03:12:06.460 --> 03:12:10.140]  and the kotke.org posting bot.
[03:12:10.140 --> 03:12:11.860]  And that's, you know, that's pretty much
[03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:13.780]  all you need to know, but I appreciate your time.
[03:12:13.780 --> 03:12:16.580]  I will also just toss in here an extra thanks
[03:12:16.580 --> 03:12:18.620]  to our fine, very fine sponsors.
[03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:19.460]  What do we have?

[03:12:44.060 --> 03:12:46.660]  I hope so, I really do.
[03:12:46.660 --> 03:12:59.940]  I think we can do it.
