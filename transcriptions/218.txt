[00:00.000 --> 00:04.880]  I thought that that was the weirdest, strangest Apple event I've ever been to.
[00:04.880 --> 00:07.520]  I couldn't shut up about it while we were there, as you probably recall.
[00:07.520 --> 00:11.560]  It was like every other word out of my mouth was, this whole thing is so weird.
[00:11.560 --> 00:12.560]  I loved it.
[00:12.560 --> 00:13.920]  I loved it so much.
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.320]  Well, I'm not complaining.
[00:16.320 --> 00:18.800]  Like I said then, it's like, I do think it was weird.
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.560]  I questioned whether it was worth our time.
[00:22.560 --> 00:26.900]  But I think that that's what makes it interesting because it wasn't like, oh, it's another iPad
[00:26.900 --> 00:33.000]  introduction event, you know, where the same things happen, it was actually kind of, you
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.840]  know, what makes it weird and different and unique is what makes it interesting to talk
[00:36.840 --> 00:37.840]  about.
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.400]  Yeah, well, I think what you said was really interesting at the event where we were talking
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.560]  and you said, well, you know, they could have just done this in a press release, like, Apple
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.820]  Pencil support is cool, but it doesn't necessarily warrant an entire event.
[00:50.820 --> 00:55.100]  And the more I thought about it, the more I was like, yeah, but the iPad isn't really
[00:55.100 --> 00:57.160]  the story of this event.
[00:57.160 --> 00:58.160]  Right?
[00:58.160 --> 00:59.160]  Like, right.
[00:59.160 --> 01:01.800]  There's a reason why we didn't hear about hardware until about 30 minutes into the one
[01:01.800 --> 01:04.240]  hour keynote presentation.
[01:04.240 --> 01:08.300]  And that's because the story was like story was the people the story was how they were
[01:08.300 --> 01:09.640]  using the products.
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.640]  Yep.
[01:10.640 --> 01:14.840]  And what made what made it all make sense to me in hindsight, like I figured it out
[01:14.840 --> 01:20.860]  by the afternoon, is that the the event wasn't for us in the media when we were secondary,
[01:20.860 --> 01:22.320]  it was for the education people.
[01:22.320 --> 01:24.360]  And there were, I don't know, hundreds.
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.840]  I mean, it was a very big event.
[01:25.840 --> 01:32.080]  And the high school in Chicago, where they held it is just enormous, just I mean, almost
[01:32.080 --> 01:40.680]  sport that comprehensively normally, I believe, I certainly felt like easily.
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.200]  And there were so hundreds and hundreds of people from the education, you know, teachers
[01:45.200 --> 01:50.820]  and people who manage devices for schools.
[01:50.820 --> 01:55.200]  From all over the place, who came to the event, like somebody after the event, recognized
[01:55.200 --> 02:01.840]  me and, you know, came up to say hi, and he's, I think he's somewhere in Indiana.
[02:01.840 --> 02:03.560]  I'm sorry, whoever you are.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.560]  It was very nice to meet you.
[02:04.560 --> 02:07.320]  I think he was from like, Bloomington, Indiana, or something.
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.400]  So it's like a two hour drive to Chicago.
[02:10.400 --> 02:13.920]  I think there were people like that from all over the Midwest, just teachers and school
[02:13.920 --> 02:15.160]  administrators and stuff.
[02:15.160 --> 02:17.840]  And that's really who the the event was for.
[02:17.840 --> 02:18.840]  Without question.
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.880]  And heck, I finally met Martin Coutts in person, and he's an educator from Scotland.
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.360]  So like, the fact that he was there, but you know what else I felt like, in addition to
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.320]  the teachers and the educators, what I thought was really striking, and I think what I appreciated
[02:34.320 --> 02:40.280]  the most was the fact that Apple invited students, and not just students from Lane Tech, like
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.280]  they had, although they had, I don't know, probably 200 of them, maybe more, who had
[02:44.280 --> 02:47.840]  a parental permission slip that had to be signed for them to go, which I thought was
[02:47.840 --> 02:49.080]  adorable.
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.360]  But they had student journalists, which I like, the second that I realized that there
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.000]  were certain student journalists sitting in the media section, my heart just like grew
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  three sizes.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.660]  I it's, yeah, it reminded me, it reminded me of my own high school experience.
[03:04.660 --> 03:09.240]  And the fact that, like, they're getting, like, to be able to get to cover an event
[03:09.240 --> 03:13.040]  that granted, you know, it's not, you know, this is not Apple's biggest media event in
[03:13.040 --> 03:14.040]  the world.
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.040]  It's not WWDC.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.040]  But it's still pretty.
[03:16.040 --> 03:17.040]  It's not really a media event.
[03:17.040 --> 03:18.440]  It's not.
[03:18.440 --> 03:19.440]  But it's still cool.
[03:19.440 --> 03:25.760]  Yeah, Panzarino and I were sitting together a couple of rows in front of you and Renee,
[03:25.760 --> 03:27.320]  I remember turning around and seeing you guys.
[03:27.320 --> 03:28.320]  I didn't see Jason.
[03:28.320 --> 03:29.320]  I don't know where he was.
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.320]  Jason was sitting right next to me.
[03:30.320 --> 03:31.320]  So he was just probably hiding.
[03:31.320 --> 03:32.320]  He must have been sitting.
[03:32.320 --> 03:35.600]  He was hiding behind the wired guys.
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.160]  But Panzarino and I were, I don't know, six rows in front of you.
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.920]  And literally, like, we were in seats like four and five in the aisle and, and seats
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.040]  one, two and three were the from the student paper at Lane Tech.
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.960]  I was like, that's amazing.
[03:51.960 --> 03:54.600]  And so Panzarino and I were like, we had the same feeling you did.
[03:54.600 --> 03:57.520]  We were like talking them up or like what, you know, how often do you publish?
[03:57.520 --> 03:59.000]  When do you think you're going to get this out?
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.840]  You know, and, you know, and they were doing it the real way.
[04:01.840 --> 04:07.680]  You know, they had a photographer, they had a writer, I guess two writers and a photographer.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.680]  Taking notes.
[04:08.680 --> 04:10.240]  I was really that was cool.
[04:10.240 --> 04:11.240]  I thought that was great.
[04:11.240 --> 04:14.440]  And like you said, they were they had the exact same media credentials we did, which
[04:14.440 --> 04:15.440]  was awesome.
[04:15.440 --> 04:16.440]  Yeah.
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.760]  Did you find out whether they're do they publish digitally or they still publish analog?
[04:20.760 --> 04:23.600]  They do print, they print once a month.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.280]  But they keep the they said, like trying to they try to keep the website more up to date.
[04:27.280 --> 04:29.160]  I was like, yeah, I'd go with the web.
[04:29.160 --> 04:30.160]  Yeah.
[04:30.160 --> 04:34.920]  Although, you know, when you're gonna focus on that, when you're in a closed environment,
[04:34.920 --> 04:36.520]  it's kind of fun to print.
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.120]  But yeah, I think once a month is probably a good target.
[04:40.120 --> 04:44.880]  Yeah, I, I don't know the entire watching that event.
[04:44.880 --> 04:50.480]  I, you know, it was also the first event in a very long time that wasn't streamed.
[04:50.480 --> 04:55.880]  And Micah Sargent, who's, of course, a writer for I'm more mentioned this, and it totally
[04:55.880 --> 05:00.280]  twigs me where he's like, Yeah, of course, it's not streamed, because it's not again,
[05:00.280 --> 05:03.900]  it's not really for the general population.
[05:03.900 --> 05:08.720]  It's for the people who really care about this, which is the educators and the students
[05:08.720 --> 05:14.120]  and the videos up afterwards for the people who want to watch, but, you know, to have
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.080]  it live streamed, I think would again, be setting the precedent or not necessarily precedent,
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.640]  but setting the expectation that like, Apple live streams an event, okay, we're gonna get
[05:22.640 --> 05:25.080]  hardware, we're gonna get all these things.
[05:25.080 --> 05:26.560]  Apple doesn't live stream an event.
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.200]  This is a not necessarily more private, but just a bit more intimate, I think.
[05:31.200 --> 05:34.280]  Yeah, there was news, but you know, not a lot.
[05:34.280 --> 05:39.340]  And I think that they, the expectations that they set, you know, were appropriate to the
[05:39.340 --> 05:41.040]  level of news that actually broke.
[05:41.040 --> 05:42.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:42.040 --> 05:47.880]  Can we talk about what happened after the the keynote slash auditorium announcement?
[05:47.880 --> 05:52.080]  Because that I thought was maybe one of the most brilliant things they've ever done after
[05:52.080 --> 05:53.080]  a keynote.
[05:53.080 --> 05:57.960]  Yeah, well, I thought it was, I would love to talk, I didn't sign an NDA about it.
[05:57.960 --> 06:00.720]  As far as I know, it's all it's all on record.
[06:00.720 --> 06:04.200]  I've been tweeting about it, and no one's come down for me from the Gestapo.
[06:04.200 --> 06:05.760]  So I think we're fine.
[06:05.760 --> 06:06.760]  Yeah.
[06:06.760 --> 06:14.080]  So, so all of us got customized schedules, when we when we got our media badges, that
[06:14.080 --> 06:18.360]  had the the one hour announcement speech on it.
[06:18.360 --> 06:22.640]  And then after that, we all got split up into about, I don't know, was it like 10 different
[06:22.640 --> 06:28.760]  classrooms that all had different aspects of, of the keynote presentation on software
[06:28.760 --> 06:31.300]  that we could essentially interact with.
[06:31.300 --> 06:37.240]  So the first the one that I ended up going to first was essentially showing off the everyone
[06:37.240 --> 06:43.900]  can create curriculum that they announced on stage with the the Fibonacci sequence.
[06:43.900 --> 06:48.040]  So they're like, okay, if we're teaching Fibonacci, you know, the Fibonacci sequence in a math
[06:48.040 --> 06:53.400]  class, you know, we could make people memorize the sequence and point out that it's in nature,
[06:53.400 --> 06:58.760]  or we could have people, you know, find and take pictures of Fibonacci sequences in nature
[06:58.760 --> 07:00.980]  and write poems about them.
[07:00.980 --> 07:08.180]  So we're all going to write and record a poem in clips with voice over to over sequences
[07:08.180 --> 07:09.820]  of Fibonacci in nature.
[07:09.820 --> 07:15.400]  And it was just like, it was just the perfect amount of over the top nonsense that I think
[07:15.400 --> 07:18.020]  it kept the media folks entertained.
[07:18.020 --> 07:23.620]  But like, all I could think of the entire time that I was in that session was this is
[07:23.620 --> 07:30.360]  exactly how my high school taught and my high school for people who probably aren't no don't
[07:30.360 --> 07:34.480]  know, like, I went to a school called LA County High School for the Arts, which was a magnet
[07:34.480 --> 07:41.140]  school, a charter school that you had to try out for in either theater, music, visual arts
[07:41.140 --> 07:43.520]  or dance.
[07:43.520 --> 07:48.920]  And so as a result, it was a school made up entirely of artistic children, which meant
[07:48.920 --> 07:54.000]  the the teachers had a very tough challenge teaching some STEM subjects.
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.340]  Because let me tell you, like, dancers and theater kids, you know, like physics is not
[07:59.340 --> 08:01.500]  our number one priority.
[08:01.500 --> 08:07.060]  Most of us were like English nerds, but they they came up with really interesting ways
[08:07.060 --> 08:11.220]  of teaching the curriculum in a way that we still you know, we still do all the standardized
[08:11.220 --> 08:12.780]  tests and all that nonsense.
[08:12.780 --> 08:17.580]  But we were also like, I remember doing a history project where I was using one of the
[08:17.580 --> 08:25.260]  earliest versions of iMovie to essentially like, reenact a version of I forget something
[08:25.260 --> 08:30.720]  in US history in the like, in the 1950s, maybe it was like the McCarthy Act or something
[08:30.720 --> 08:31.900]  like that.
[08:31.900 --> 08:34.780]  And then we did how it compares to Star Wars.
[08:34.780 --> 08:40.040]  Like that was our project that got that was a way for me to learn about an aspect of history.
[08:40.040 --> 08:48.200]  So like, some like minor sub tangent aside, being in this classroom, you know, two decades
[08:48.200 --> 08:54.940]  later, and realizing that like, Apple is basically tapping into the same things that I found
[08:54.940 --> 09:00.860]  worked tremendously well for me as a student, as an artistic kid, but I can also see the
[09:00.860 --> 09:06.660]  vice versa where someone who is really into math or science or something like that, but
[09:06.660 --> 09:13.300]  doesn't really see themselves as a creative person now has potentially avenues to go down
[09:13.300 --> 09:14.300]  for creativity.
[09:14.300 --> 09:18.020]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I thought and and I saw some every time
[09:18.020 --> 09:25.900]  I bring up clips, and I'm fascinated by the clips app, because I think it's I, people
[09:25.900 --> 09:27.540]  say, Well, do you use it all the time?
[09:27.540 --> 09:29.820]  And the answer is no, I actually don't.
[09:29.820 --> 09:32.020]  But I kind of feel like I should use it more.
[09:32.020 --> 09:35.500]  And I've done it like probably I'll try to remember to use it Sunday at Easter when we're
[09:35.500 --> 09:40.340]  visiting with family, because it's a great way to just sort of just put a bunch of videos
[09:40.340 --> 09:44.660]  and stuff with all the kids in the family and share it, you know, that I don't know,
[09:44.660 --> 09:49.100]  I've done it before, like little, like family events, and everybody loves it.
[09:49.100 --> 09:51.140]  But it gets such a fascinating app.
[09:51.140 --> 09:57.140]  And I've, you know, my description of it is sort of like a, it's like a cross between
[09:57.140 --> 10:00.780]  keynote and iMovie optimized.
[10:00.780 --> 10:05.540]  And that's and I've talked to Apple about this before.
[10:05.540 --> 10:09.880]  And you know, but they said that it is, you know, and again, it is it true?
[10:09.880 --> 10:11.340]  Is it just what Apple wants to be true?
[10:11.340 --> 10:12.340]  Or is it true?
[10:12.340 --> 10:15.380]  I can't prove it because I'm not in these schools, but that you know, the place where
[10:15.380 --> 10:21.320]  it's the biggest hit is the education market and that kids are doing, you know, teachers
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.040]  are assigning things like exactly like the demo thing we did like, you know, pretty much
[10:26.040 --> 10:30.260]  just make like a little minute long movie.
[10:30.260 --> 10:35.300]  And they're doing it for things like field trips, like so if the class goes to a museum,
[10:35.300 --> 10:40.780]  you take a bunch of iPads along, and you know, your assignment is to create like a minute
[10:40.780 --> 10:46.620]  long clips thing of whatever the subject is that you're going to the museum to study.
[10:46.620 --> 10:54.700]  And if you think, you know, and it's a way for kids to learn it, you know, like if you
[10:54.700 --> 10:58.380]  did like a keynote deck, it's not as interactive, right?
[10:58.380 --> 10:59.760]  It just feels stayed.
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.480]  And it's sort of intended for something that you're supposed to be speaking a long slide
[11:03.480 --> 11:06.420]  as you see it, whereas clips stands alone.
[11:06.420 --> 11:11.140]  And so it can be graded more like regular homework, and you don't have to have all 25
[11:11.140 --> 11:13.060]  kids in the class stand up and spend fun.
[11:13.060 --> 11:17.020]  You know what I did on my summer vacation at the art museum?
[11:17.020 --> 11:18.780]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[11:18.780 --> 11:22.640]  And it lends itself to very short movies.
[11:22.640 --> 11:30.080]  And I think one of the things that's so fascinating about kids today is that, I mean, video has
[11:30.080 --> 11:34.020]  always been getting shorter and shorter and edited and you know, people used to think
[11:34.020 --> 11:41.380]  like in the 80s that music videos were, you know, crazily, quick edited, you know, quick
[11:41.380 --> 11:45.540]  shots, but that's nothing compared to, you know, the brevity of like YouTube videos,
[11:45.540 --> 11:50.060]  you know, and I think kids get that like kids, it's, it's actually works in their favor that
[11:50.060 --> 11:53.460]  their attention spans are shorter, right that they can if you can condense the whole thing
[11:53.460 --> 11:56.420]  into 45 second clips video.
[11:56.420 --> 11:57.420]  That's great.
[11:57.420 --> 11:58.420]  Yeah, well point across.
[11:58.420 --> 11:59.420]  Exactly.
[11:59.420 --> 12:03.220]  I think that's that's exactly it is, you know, we're these are kids that have grown up in
[12:03.220 --> 12:05.980]  the era of Twitter and YouTube.
[12:05.980 --> 12:10.860]  And there is something to say about being able to make your point succinctly, and not,
[12:10.860 --> 12:15.640]  you know, bloviate on for for 20 pages or 30 minutes.
[12:15.640 --> 12:20.180]  You know, I remember as a kid doing like you, you had to do the like the state reports,
[12:20.180 --> 12:21.180]  right?
[12:21.180 --> 12:25.900]  And I had to do a state report on main, they're like, minimum 20 pages, but you're president
[12:25.900 --> 12:26.900]  Kentucky.
[12:26.900 --> 12:27.900]  Oh, my God.
[12:27.900 --> 12:29.820]  It's an interesting one.
[12:29.820 --> 12:30.820]  Yeah.
[12:30.820 --> 12:35.260]  Although mine was in second grade, so it was not 20 pages, it's pretty much like a like
[12:35.260 --> 12:36.260]  a one sheet.
[12:36.260 --> 12:40.740]  Oh, my God, most of which was most of which was a very poorly drawn man.
[12:40.740 --> 12:46.620]  Mine, mine was in third grade, but they literally had us they were like, Yes, we want you to
[12:46.620 --> 12:48.500]  have all of these sections.
[12:48.500 --> 12:54.700]  And it's okay if you outright copy from books, but you're essentially making this portfolio
[12:54.700 --> 12:56.900]  of the state.
[12:56.900 --> 13:01.460]  And then you had to present it and then bring in a baked good from that state, which was
[13:01.460 --> 13:07.260]  hilarious says, but yeah, like, I don't know, I just I think clips is easier.
[13:07.260 --> 13:08.260]  Yeah.
[13:08.260 --> 13:12.180]  So effectively, what they did, and I was trying to think about how many classrooms because
[13:12.180 --> 13:18.100]  it felt like the classroom I was in, there were four tables of eight.
[13:18.100 --> 13:23.220]  Yeah, I think we had like 30 30 people in our class, maybe 25.
[13:23.220 --> 13:27.220]  Yeah, I think we probably I think we had 32.
[13:27.220 --> 13:30.100]  But if there were a couple hundred people there, they must have had it split up between
[13:30.100 --> 13:31.100]  a whole.
[13:31.100 --> 13:32.100]  There must have been a bunch of them.
[13:32.100 --> 13:33.100]  I don't know.
[13:33.100 --> 13:34.100]  Yeah.
[13:34.100 --> 13:38.020]  But effectively, they had us go through like, an hour long fake, you know, three classes
[13:38.020 --> 13:41.220]  of school math with this Fibonacci thing.
[13:41.220 --> 13:46.100]  Christ, I blacked out I don't even remember what the other ones were math, math, history
[13:46.100 --> 13:47.100]  and coding.
[13:47.100 --> 13:48.100]  Oh, right.
[13:48.100 --> 13:50.100]  With the Swift playgrounds.
[13:50.100 --> 13:51.100]  Yeah.
[13:51.100 --> 13:55.700]  I see I'm I get why they did it and it but it wasn't for me.
[13:55.700 --> 13:56.700]  Right.
[13:56.700 --> 14:01.500]  And so I only enjoyed it at the meta level of watching the like the guy next to me was
[14:01.500 --> 14:04.700]  from the Chicago School District.
[14:04.700 --> 14:07.840]  And he you know, it could he'd never seen clips before.
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.560]  So like, it had a totally different perspective on it than me.
[14:10.560 --> 14:13.780]  So I like let him I was like, here, I've done this out.
[14:13.780 --> 14:17.020]  You know, you can you know, because they had like one iPad for every two people.
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.020]  Yeah, you drive.
[14:18.020 --> 14:23.100]  Yeah, I saw as I you drive because I kind of know this, but I'm interested.
[14:23.100 --> 14:28.380]  But the thing that hit me was I've, I've often thought like, what would happen if I like
[14:28.380 --> 14:30.580]  quantum leaped back into my high school self?
[14:30.580 --> 14:31.660]  Could I could I handle it?
[14:31.660 --> 14:33.060]  And the answer is no.
[14:33.060 --> 14:39.300]  Like if I'd like, if my current 45 year old mind was suddenly transformed back to like
[14:39.300 --> 14:46.140]  my 17 year old self, I would have to quit school like I physically could not I honestly
[14:46.140 --> 14:47.780]  thought about getting up and just leaving.
[14:47.780 --> 14:50.260]  And I just didn't want to be rude and draw attention to myself.
[14:50.260 --> 14:54.660]  But I, I just couldn't stand to be there learning things I already knew.
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.620]  It was very strange.
[14:56.620 --> 15:00.460]  I mean, I think that's also 17 year olds who get stuck in classes.
[15:00.460 --> 15:01.740]  They already know, right?
[15:01.740 --> 15:04.100]  Like it's, I just don't.
[15:04.100 --> 15:05.420]  I have a recurring dream.
[15:05.420 --> 15:10.500]  I have a recurring dream that's somewhat regular that I'm back in high school.
[15:10.500 --> 15:14.820]  And I'm incredibly bored, and I don't want to do the work.
[15:14.820 --> 15:19.300]  And then it suddenly occurs to me, hey, but you know, you've got like a website and you
[15:19.300 --> 15:20.340]  make a good living on it.
[15:20.340 --> 15:21.340]  You don't have to do this.
[15:21.340 --> 15:22.340]  You can just leave.
[15:22.340 --> 15:23.340]  You don't need to.
[15:23.340 --> 15:27.020]  You could just quit high school and just go post something to during fireball.
[15:27.020 --> 15:28.020]  And I'm so happy.
[15:28.020 --> 15:29.020]  And I think, Oh, this is great.
[15:29.020 --> 15:32.100]  I'll just get up and leave.
[15:32.100 --> 15:33.380]  And then you're actually in that situation.
[15:33.380 --> 15:35.500]  And you're like, I can't leave.
[15:35.500 --> 15:36.500]  Yeah.
[15:36.500 --> 15:37.500]  I can't.
[15:37.500 --> 15:41.820]  Like, I like I'm not complaining, you know, I don't want it to seem like I
[15:41.820 --> 15:47.260]  I don't think it was a bad, I think it was a great idea.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.860]  I think you're exactly right.
[15:48.860 --> 15:51.120]  But it was a great idea for the education people.
[15:51.120 --> 15:58.180]  And the main point of it clearly was, and I think this is the whole point of the event.
[15:58.180 --> 16:03.100]  Here we are getting to our main thesis, 15 minutes into the show, but the main point
[16:03.100 --> 16:10.620]  is that Apple is losing in the education market to Chromebooks.
[16:10.620 --> 16:17.500]  And they that that whole after show curriculum was entirely if you think about it, things
[16:17.500 --> 16:20.180]  that you can do on an iPad that you can't do on a Chromebook.
[16:20.180 --> 16:25.900]  Oh, it completely it's let me show you let me show you why the app market and why the
[16:25.900 --> 16:32.240]  tablet interface is a better fit for teaching people of all from all walks of life, then
[16:32.240 --> 16:38.980]  here have a cheapo laptop, right?
[16:38.980 --> 16:43.800]  The other thing that they had after the event were what they call them labs.
[16:43.800 --> 16:47.580]  They were just more they're a little bit more traditional, a little bit more of a tradition,
[16:47.580 --> 16:50.660]  but they were they were just in like regular classrooms, which is really cool.
[16:50.660 --> 16:57.060]  They were little mini dub dub DC sessions, almost interactive dub dub DC sessions.
[16:57.060 --> 17:04.100]  And they had developers with certain apps, like AR apps, AR was a big thing, because
[17:04.100 --> 17:09.100]  AR is one of those things that a, it is cool.
[17:09.100 --> 17:15.900]  But be iOS is like ahead of the rest of the world by years at this, it seems like at this
[17:15.900 --> 17:21.860]  point in terms of having it actually not be like conjectural, but like, here, here's an
[17:21.860 --> 17:25.600]  actual AR thing that would be useful to have in a classroom right now.
[17:25.600 --> 17:32.020]  And not only can you know, it's running on our $1200 iPads, but also on this $329 iPad
[17:32.020 --> 17:35.300]  that you know, right, which is only $299 for education.
[17:35.300 --> 17:36.300]  Exactly.
[17:36.300 --> 17:43.460]  I'm trying to remember the name of the app, which which app was it.
[17:43.460 --> 17:50.340]  It was like a wayfaring app where you you would point the iPads camera at like a picture
[17:50.340 --> 17:54.940]  of the Roman Colosseum on the desk, just like a printout.
[17:54.940 --> 17:59.500]  And then it would instantly the actual Roman Colosseum would pop up out of the desk in
[17:59.500 --> 18:06.780]  three dimensions, like, instantly sort of like scanning a QR code, but ugly QR code.
[18:06.780 --> 18:11.660]  It's a book like, yeah, and scanning and then you have an instant thing.
[18:11.660 --> 18:15.900]  Was it Matt bronze app, the guy who does sketch party?
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.020]  I know he also does one that's very similar to that.
[18:20.020 --> 18:21.740]  Yeah, maybe.
[18:21.740 --> 18:23.140]  Yeah, it was cool.
[18:23.140 --> 18:24.860]  In any case, it was really cool.
[18:24.860 --> 18:25.960]  It was very cool.
[18:25.960 --> 18:33.860]  You know, I think my favorite VR or my favorite AR demo, which really wasn't AR so much as
[18:33.860 --> 18:35.940]  actual reality.
[18:35.940 --> 18:43.780]  So I guess a different AR was the Swift Playgrounds demos, which, in fairness, I've actually seen
[18:43.780 --> 18:48.780]  variations of this before Swift Playgrounds working together with Sphero is not new.
[18:48.780 --> 18:52.820]  But there are the difference was in how it was presented.
[18:52.820 --> 18:57.380]  Whereas before, it's always been very theoretical, like, hey, sweet, you can program Sphero droids
[18:57.380 --> 18:59.260]  and Swift Playgrounds.
[18:59.260 --> 19:05.960]  And in this lab, they actually built a tiny replica of Chicago on on a table, complete
[19:05.960 --> 19:10.420]  with like paper buildings and car and like toy box cars.
[19:10.420 --> 19:14.820]  And they put a little a little Sphero spark and it's like, okay, here, we're going to
[19:14.820 --> 19:19.880]  give you an app, we're going to give you Swift Playgrounds and your job is to program how
[19:19.880 --> 19:25.580]  far the spark needs to go and turn in order to get to our little, you know, paper Apple
[19:25.580 --> 19:27.140]  store.
[19:27.140 --> 19:34.460]  And as as gimmicky as it was, it made me feel powerful about programming Swift in a way
[19:34.460 --> 19:38.920]  that playing with Swift Playgrounds for about a year now has not.
[19:38.920 --> 19:42.080]  And then double that with the with the drone lab.
[19:42.080 --> 19:43.260]  Did you do that one, John?
[19:43.260 --> 19:44.260]  Because that one was fine.
[19:44.260 --> 19:45.740]  It was too.
[19:45.740 --> 19:46.740]  It looked cool.
[19:46.740 --> 19:48.820]  That was the one that was sort of like behind like a batting cage.
[19:48.820 --> 19:53.340]  Yeah, because they didn't want to fly into people, right?
[19:53.340 --> 19:54.420]  So I don't blame them for that.
[19:54.420 --> 19:58.580]  I think that was I think that was well considered.
[19:58.580 --> 20:01.740]  I did not do it, though, because there was too long of a line.
[20:01.740 --> 20:03.580]  I'd lost lost my patience.
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.580]  That's okay.
[20:04.580 --> 20:05.660]  It is matte bronze app.
[20:05.660 --> 20:06.880]  It's a matte bronze app.
[20:06.880 --> 20:08.260]  And it's called waypoint.
[20:08.260 --> 20:10.060]  I will put it in the show notes.
[20:10.060 --> 20:12.380]  It's very cool.
[20:12.380 --> 20:13.420]  Waypoint edu.
[20:13.420 --> 20:20.660]  But it really it's a super, super fun and engaging way to see things like so the Parthenon
[20:20.660 --> 20:28.700]  that shows up or not Parthenon Roman Coliseum was sort of an attempt at rendering it the
[20:28.700 --> 20:32.900]  way that actually looked when it was new, as opposed to the state of ruin that it's
[20:32.900 --> 20:33.900]  in now.
[20:33.900 --> 20:39.020]  And you could, you know, on an eye and it also really demonstrates like the advantage
[20:39.020 --> 20:43.580]  of an iPad over an iPhone for this because I could, you know, you could zoom in and it's
[20:43.580 --> 20:47.100]  so much bigger and you could see the detail.
[20:47.100 --> 20:51.740]  But you could really see the way that it worked in a way that like no single still photo could
[20:51.740 --> 20:53.140]  show you.
[20:53.140 --> 20:55.540]  Yeah, not even a little bit.
[20:55.540 --> 21:02.460]  I, I find it's interesting because I definitely I know Frazier was Frazier spheres, who of
[21:02.460 --> 21:08.140]  course is an educator, was being a little cranky about the AR stuff during the presentation
[21:08.140 --> 21:13.340]  and for good reason where he's like, OK, why, you know, there's the AR app Froggapedia that
[21:13.340 --> 21:18.540]  they showed and it's like, why is dissecting a virtual frog and AR on a tabletop so much
[21:18.540 --> 21:23.780]  more interesting than dissecting a virtual frog just with, you know, flat on the ground?
[21:23.780 --> 21:28.380]  The answer is for that one, probably not so much.
[21:28.380 --> 21:38.380]  But what is nice about different AR experiences like Waypoint is that you can really like
[21:38.380 --> 21:41.300]  walk around and zoom in and zoom out.
[21:41.300 --> 21:46.420]  And, you know, there was another another app whose name escapes me that was similar to
[21:46.420 --> 21:53.500]  Waypoint that deals with interactive children, like turning books into interactive experiences
[21:53.500 --> 21:58.580]  and showed like, oh, this is a first grader's textbook about showing relationships between
[21:58.580 --> 22:01.120]  mama animals and baby animals.
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.320]  And so once you once the iPad sees the book, it automatically pops up this these three
[22:07.320 --> 22:13.560]  different biomes with like a mama elephant, a mama llama and a mama llama say that five
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.900]  times fast and like a mama bear.
[22:15.900 --> 22:23.220]  And then you have these little tiny like kid, kid animals in the in a dock type thing.
[22:23.220 --> 22:29.560]  And then you basically your job is to like, drag the animal to the appropriate the appropriate
[22:29.560 --> 22:33.940]  pair and then if you get it right, they interact and they act real cute together.
[22:33.940 --> 22:38.900]  And if you get it wrong, they like it completely ignore each other or get into a fight and
[22:38.900 --> 22:43.900]  then the baby returns to the dock and it's just, yeah, I don't know.
[22:43.900 --> 22:48.220]  Have you ever do you have any this is a side tangent, but I promise it makes sense.
[22:48.220 --> 22:53.220]  Like, have you ever seen old video clips of yourself when you're a kid?
[22:53.220 --> 22:57.140]  Like early kid like three to seven?
[22:57.140 --> 23:01.260]  Not many because I'm so old that it was that they they were on super eight film.
[23:01.260 --> 23:02.540]  Yeah, we didn't have video.
[23:02.540 --> 23:03.540]  So here's the thing.
[23:03.540 --> 23:08.780]  So there are some some super eight my my my mom's brother had it was sort of the gadget
[23:08.780 --> 23:12.420]  hand to the family and he had some super eight videos of us.
[23:12.420 --> 23:13.420]  Yeah.
[23:13.420 --> 23:14.420]  Do you have any?
[23:14.420 --> 23:18.580]  Well, my dad also filmed a bunch of us on like a bunch of early stuff on super eight
[23:18.580 --> 23:21.240]  and he's been digitizing it the last week.
[23:21.240 --> 23:25.180]  And he sent me a Dropbox folder full of all of these, these clips.
[23:25.180 --> 23:29.500]  And so I was watching one of them and it's like, I'm I don't know, I'm like, two years
[23:29.500 --> 23:31.660]  old, just about two years old.
[23:31.660 --> 23:35.980]  And it's like these just puzzles, you know, just various various puzzles that you buy
[23:35.980 --> 23:37.440]  for kids.
[23:37.440 --> 23:42.980]  And one of them is like, match match the letter to the shape, you know, so it's like a W in
[23:42.980 --> 23:47.820]  the shape of a watermelon and another one was like, match the animal to the to the animal
[23:47.820 --> 23:49.680]  cut out.
[23:49.680 --> 23:54.820]  And I'm looking at this and as I'm watching it, I'm like, this is exactly this education
[23:54.820 --> 23:55.820]  demo.
[23:55.820 --> 24:01.600]  This is just this education demo for like 20 for 2018 instead of 1989 where instead
[24:01.600 --> 24:09.300]  of me physically putting, you know, a block into another, you know, wooden cutout, instead,
[24:09.300 --> 24:14.500]  I get to use a glass screen and virtually pair people.
[24:14.500 --> 24:20.900]  It's just it's, it was a I don't know, it was very weird to, to have that kind of like,
[24:20.900 --> 24:22.580]  Oh, my God, everything old is new again.
[24:22.580 --> 24:23.580]  Yeah.
[24:23.580 --> 24:26.140]  All right, let me take a break here and thank our first sponsor.
[24:26.140 --> 24:29.220]  I'm very excited about this because this is a brand new sponsor for the show.
[24:29.220 --> 24:32.740]  And I absolutely have I had never heard of this app before.
[24:32.740 --> 24:37.140]  And I feel like I should have because I, I need I needed this, I need this app, like,
[24:37.140 --> 24:41.260]  so this is now an app that is on my Mac, and it will be used regularly.
[24:41.260 --> 24:44.100]  It's an app called radio silence.
[24:44.100 --> 24:49.120]  Radio silence is an outbound firewall for your Mac, it shows you all the connections
[24:49.120 --> 24:53.580]  that apps make to networking, you know, whether they're just getting gathering analytics,
[24:53.580 --> 24:57.900]  showing ads, getting software updates.
[24:57.900 --> 25:02.660]  And so if you see an app that's misbehaving, or like when I can imagine using this is when
[25:02.660 --> 25:08.060]  I'm on some kind of like, I'm traveling overseas, or sometimes over the years, we've gone on
[25:08.060 --> 25:14.140]  cruises, and you pay, you know, exorbitant rates for bandwidth.
[25:14.140 --> 25:19.620]  And I've done it where it's like, I just opened my Mac, and I, you know, spring for like 250
[25:19.620 --> 25:24.620]  megabytes of bandwidth or something, I opened my Mac, and like, two minutes later, it's
[25:24.620 --> 25:25.660]  like, yep, you're up.
[25:25.660 --> 25:27.980]  And that's like, I didn't even do anything yet, just because of all the stuff running
[25:27.980 --> 25:30.420]  in the background.
[25:30.420 --> 25:33.900]  Radio silence lets you see it and block it any app, you don't want to connect to the
[25:33.900 --> 25:35.920]  network with a single click.
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.900]  But there's a lot of apps that do stuff sort of like this.
[25:39.900 --> 25:43.820]  And most of them are very complicated, either a very complicated because they're sort of
[25:43.820 --> 25:48.660]  geared towards like a network administrator, or from my perspective, and I'm not going
[25:48.660 --> 25:52.960]  to name names, but there are some apps that I've tried along the lines that are incredibly
[25:52.960 --> 25:55.620]  annoying because they default to blocking everything.
[25:55.620 --> 25:58.700]  And then it's like, you know, you're getting all these notifications, paying this apps
[25:58.700 --> 26:04.220]  doing something, that apps doing something, radio silence goes the other way, it is completely
[26:04.220 --> 26:09.460]  unobtrusive, unobtrusive and invisible day to day, there's no pop ups, no notifications,
[26:09.460 --> 26:15.460]  no blinking lights in your menu bar, nothing, it's like, you install it, and it never interrupts
[26:15.460 --> 26:22.420]  your work or distracts you, you go to it to see what is using networking, and then you
[26:22.420 --> 26:23.420]  can block it.
[26:23.420 --> 26:28.620]  So it's something like for you to drive, not something that like pesters you.
[26:28.620 --> 26:35.060]  And it really is as as unobtrusive as as, as they say, just go to the website.
[26:35.060 --> 26:38.620]  It's radio silence app.com.
[26:38.620 --> 26:40.540]  And just take a look at a screenshot, and you'll see what I mean.
[26:40.540 --> 26:45.540]  It looks super modern, it is exactly what you would want in a simple, almost like if
[26:45.540 --> 26:51.100]  Apple built a feature like this into Mac OS, just how nice and simple it is.
[26:51.100 --> 26:52.780]  I really, really like it.
[26:52.780 --> 26:53.780]  It's gotten great reviews.
[26:53.780 --> 26:55.980]  This is why I can't believe I didn't hear about it until now.
[26:55.980 --> 27:02.380]  But version 2.0 was on Mac world's best reviewed apps of the year, back in 2016.
[27:02.380 --> 27:04.940]  And it's super cheap, it is so affordable.
[27:04.940 --> 27:08.500]  It's nine bucks for a single person, and it's not tied to a single Mac.
[27:08.500 --> 27:14.520]  So if you've got like, an iMac and a MacBook, you can install it on both of them.
[27:14.520 --> 27:19.560]  You're not cheating the license system nine bucks and $49 for a team license with no hard
[27:19.560 --> 27:23.620]  seat limit suitable for small companies and families.
[27:23.620 --> 27:26.900]  Whatever you consider a quote unquote team.
[27:26.900 --> 27:29.380]  And the developer trusts your judgment on that.
[27:29.380 --> 27:33.940]  So it's really, really just a super nice app.
[27:33.940 --> 27:40.140]  So anyway, the last but not least, he offers a 30 day, no questions asked money back guarantee.
[27:40.140 --> 27:44.820]  So if you go and buy it, and spend the nine bucks, and within 30 days, you think that
[27:44.820 --> 27:48.660]  nine bucks wasn't money well spent, which I highly doubt I don't know that anybody I
[27:48.660 --> 27:50.980]  don't see why anybody would regret spending nine bucks on this.
[27:50.980 --> 27:54.620]  So all you have to do is send him an email and just say, Hey, can I get my money back
[27:54.620 --> 27:58.020]  and with no gimmick or no pushback, he'll just give you your money back.
[27:58.020 --> 28:01.100]  So go check it out radio silence app.com.
[28:01.100 --> 28:05.900]  It's a fantastic app for the Mac, I really, really love it.
[28:05.900 --> 28:07.580]  And so happy to have him as a sponsor.
[28:07.580 --> 28:13.300]  It's a great app, I'm happy to recommend it.
[28:13.300 --> 28:17.260]  So the elephant in the room with this education advantage Chromebooks, and I thought one of
[28:17.260 --> 28:25.340]  the most interesting points of the whole thing was when Greg Joswiak actually mentioned Chromebooks
[28:25.340 --> 28:30.900]  by name, because I like my ears perked up at that moment, because I did not expect that.
[28:30.900 --> 28:36.580]  And it was in context of iPad performance that with an A 10 system on a chip that it
[28:36.580 --> 28:42.140]  outperforms I'm paraphrasing here, but I think I'm paraphrasing very closely outperforms
[28:42.140 --> 28:51.900]  most notebook PCs, and virtually all Chromebooks.
[28:51.900 --> 28:56.380]  And part of the there's a couple of things that were weird about that segment, one was
[28:56.380 --> 29:03.460]  mentioning Chromebooks by name, as opposed to quote unquote, you know, notebook PCs.
[29:03.460 --> 29:09.940]  But the other thing and it's it is an uncomfortable situation for Apple, and maybe for Intel,
[29:09.940 --> 29:19.860]  but the truth is, a 10 powered iPad outperforms most MacBooks to like, it's one of the recurring
[29:19.860 --> 29:25.700]  themes of, you know, my show in recent months has been the undying popularity of the MacBook
[29:25.700 --> 29:31.580]  Air, you know, and the truth is just very simple, that because the MacBook Air is the
[29:31.580 --> 29:33.460]  one that's $999.
[29:33.460 --> 29:37.140]  That's still the one that most people buy when they go into an Apple store to buy a
[29:37.140 --> 29:38.140]  Mac.
[29:38.140 --> 29:41.380]  Yes, they want the they want something cheap and reliable.
[29:41.380 --> 29:45.340]  Well, and for most people, $999 is not cheap.
[29:45.340 --> 29:48.740]  It's actually a lot of money, you know, I mean, it's, you know, cheap, you know, cheap
[29:48.740 --> 29:52.140]  asterisk for a Mac.
[29:52.140 --> 29:54.140]  Right.
[29:54.140 --> 30:00.780]  And an iPad is, I think, by almost any measure, a more powerful computer with an Apple A 10,
[30:00.780 --> 30:06.380]  you know, system on a chip is a more powerful computing device, and more way more powerful
[30:06.380 --> 30:11.660]  GPU than what you get in a MacBook Air or in the little thin MacBook, you know, with
[30:11.660 --> 30:18.780]  the the whatever the low power Intel chip is the core.
[30:18.780 --> 30:23.500]  So they can't really mention that right, like Apple's in a tight spot where they can't quite
[30:23.500 --> 30:29.420]  brag as thoroughly as they could on technical merits about the A 10 because it would, it
[30:29.420 --> 30:31.220]  would make their Macs look bad.
[30:31.220 --> 30:32.220]  Yeah.
[30:32.220 --> 30:35.720]  But the thing is, here's the thing, here's the whole thing is.
[30:35.720 --> 30:37.540]  What does that matter?
[30:37.540 --> 30:40.180]  Because nobody's buying Chromebooks, because they're powerful.
[30:40.180 --> 30:43.700]  They're buying them because they are dirt cheap.
[30:43.700 --> 30:46.060]  And that's really it.
[30:46.060 --> 30:51.100]  And they are optimized for using Google Docs, which is what an awful lot of education, you
[30:51.100 --> 30:56.220]  know, a lot of schools are either have already moved or are moving to Google Docs.
[30:56.220 --> 31:00.140]  And it's effectively a device that was built from the ground up to be like a front end
[31:00.140 --> 31:02.140]  to Google's online services.
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.140]  Yeah.
[31:03.140 --> 31:04.340]  And I think you're right.
[31:04.340 --> 31:06.860]  Does it matter that the A 10 is more powerful?
[31:06.860 --> 31:13.980]  I know, except I'd say no, no, if all you're doing is using Google Docs, right?
[31:13.980 --> 31:20.340]  If you're just writing reports or sharing spreadsheets or keynote or PowerPoint presentations,
[31:20.340 --> 31:21.920]  I don't think it matters.
[31:21.920 --> 31:27.620]  But the I think the argument from Apple is, that's not how you should be educating, which
[31:27.620 --> 31:29.660]  sounds really pretentious when I put it that way.
[31:29.660 --> 31:35.260]  But But no, I mean, I think Apple is saying we can be better for our students.
[31:35.260 --> 31:41.280]  And we can make we can make education not only more fun for students, but more fun for
[31:41.280 --> 31:46.760]  teachers, and more contextualized and specific.
[31:46.760 --> 31:50.180]  One of the things that I thought was really cool that they talked about in the new class
[31:50.180 --> 31:56.860]  kit app or not class kit class, it's the framework, school classroom, class, or schoolwork classwork
[31:56.860 --> 32:00.860]  schoolwork.
[32:00.860 --> 32:02.980]  I think one of them is called classroom.
[32:02.980 --> 32:06.420]  And that's the one where the teacher can manage the kids classes.
[32:06.420 --> 32:07.420]  Yeah.
[32:07.420 --> 32:09.180]  Or the kids iPads in the room.
[32:09.180 --> 32:10.180]  Yes.
[32:10.180 --> 32:11.180]  And we'll talk about that.
[32:11.180 --> 32:12.180]  We could talk.
[32:12.180 --> 32:13.460]  I would definitely we'll talk about that in a bit.
[32:13.460 --> 32:16.460]  And then I guess the other one is that it went to school work.
[32:16.460 --> 32:18.380]  Yeah, yeah, schoolwork.
[32:18.380 --> 32:21.300]  And so that's how you can submit your homework and stuff like that.
[32:21.300 --> 32:22.300]  Yeah.
[32:22.300 --> 32:25.620]  But what I thought was really interesting about schoolwork is at first, it just looks
[32:25.620 --> 32:32.520]  like any other managed education platform like Canvas or Blackboard or anything.
[32:32.520 --> 32:35.340]  Most of them have been around for a while and they're like CMSs, which is to say they
[32:35.340 --> 32:37.980]  all suck and they all have limitations.
[32:37.980 --> 32:43.820]  But what I thought was an interesting addition is the idea of, oh, you know, those, you know,
[32:43.820 --> 32:47.540]  hundreds of thousands of education apps that we have in the store, we're going to provide
[32:47.540 --> 32:50.140]  a really simple API that they can incorporate.
[32:50.140 --> 32:57.060]  So now if you want to assign anything from those apps as an assignment, all you have
[32:57.060 --> 33:00.460]  to do is essentially like press a button.
[33:00.460 --> 33:05.900]  And then on the kid's side, they see new homework, go to this app and complete this lesson.
[33:05.900 --> 33:09.260]  And all they have to do is press that button and they're automatically zoomed into that
[33:09.260 --> 33:11.100]  app specifically to that lesson.
[33:11.100 --> 33:15.980]  And then the teacher can monitor that portion of it like that.
[33:15.980 --> 33:20.300]  That is an example of something that no Chromebook will be able to do in a million years.
[33:20.300 --> 33:21.300]  Right.
[33:21.300 --> 33:26.340]  And I, that was the part of the after event demo that all of a sudden I was totally engaged
[33:26.340 --> 33:30.700]  because I was like, oh, that's very interesting because it was like the quote unquote teacher
[33:30.700 --> 33:35.100]  who was, you know, like an Apple product marketing person pretending to be a teacher, but doing
[33:35.100 --> 33:36.100]  a very good job of it.
[33:36.100 --> 33:39.180]  It was like, I think they were, I think they were distinguished educators.
[33:39.180 --> 33:44.020]  I think all of the teachers in the class were, I don't know about that because I think I
[33:44.020 --> 33:46.140]  knew the guy who's doing mine.
[33:46.140 --> 33:47.820]  I've seen him, I've seen him before.
[33:47.820 --> 33:48.820]  All right.
[33:48.820 --> 33:53.460]  So maybe, maybe they were marketing people in education, but there were distinguished
[33:53.460 --> 33:58.060]  educators as the table leads because I do remember them saying that.
[33:58.060 --> 34:00.420]  Yes, yes.
[34:00.420 --> 34:05.740]  But the part where he was like, okay, everybody's, you know, you know, buddy up, there's an iPad
[34:05.740 --> 34:07.460]  for every two of you.
[34:07.460 --> 34:11.900]  We're going to start the lesson and we're going to put you into clips.
[34:11.900 --> 34:17.540]  And then all of a sudden the iPad that we had was open and click on and, you know, open
[34:17.540 --> 34:24.260]  to an existing like clips project and you know, hitting the home button wouldn't take
[34:24.260 --> 34:25.260]  you home.
[34:25.260 --> 34:27.020]  It's like you're, you're in clips and you're going to like it.
[34:27.020 --> 34:29.980]  And I was like, that is, that's really interesting.
[34:29.980 --> 34:32.260]  I thought that was, and it happened very quickly.
[34:32.260 --> 34:34.620]  Like the latency on that was obviously very, very low.
[34:34.620 --> 34:38.300]  It did not, there wasn't like a, a spinner or something like that.
[34:38.300 --> 34:40.580]  It, it was a solid demo.
[34:40.580 --> 34:46.020]  And it, of course, it's, you know, you get the, the utility of that feature is so obvious.
[34:46.020 --> 34:47.540]  You don't even really need to talk about it.
[34:47.540 --> 34:50.660]  I mean, for classrooms, so yeah, right.
[34:50.660 --> 34:55.260]  I think about, you know, I taught at Emerson for a year and I think about all of this stuff
[34:55.260 --> 35:00.560]  that I had to try and coax people through with, with coding where it's like, okay, here
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.060]  is what's on my screen.
[35:02.060 --> 35:06.340]  Now we're going to code the same thing or do something very similar or follow along
[35:06.340 --> 35:11.740]  with me and then having to go, you know, walk screen by screen by screen to make sure that
[35:11.740 --> 35:17.140]  everybody was actually doing this and like, and figured it out and understood all of it.
[35:17.140 --> 35:19.680]  And the idea that, oh yeah, I can handle all of that.
[35:19.680 --> 35:25.300]  I can give every single student a preset and it can live update with me or it can live
[35:25.300 --> 35:27.220]  update individually with them.
[35:27.220 --> 35:32.860]  I can instantly preview their screen on my screen without having to walk around.
[35:32.860 --> 35:36.820]  Like there, there are a lot of really fascinating tools in here.
[35:36.820 --> 35:39.480]  I thought the other thing that was interesting, I don't want to forget it while we're talking
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.060]  about classroom, but it was one of the few times where they mentioned the Mac and it
[35:44.060 --> 35:48.360]  was that, that, you know, this, this classroom app is not new for iPad.
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.900]  It's been out for a while or at least a year, but they said one of the things we've heard
[35:52.900 --> 35:58.980]  from a lot of teachers is they want to do this from their Mac books or I guess just
[35:58.980 --> 36:02.180]  Macs in general if they have like an iMac, but for the most part, from what I've seen
[36:02.180 --> 36:05.820]  at Jonas's school, all the teachers have Mac book errors.
[36:05.820 --> 36:09.140]  Every teacher, I don't think, I don't know if they're from the school or not, but like
[36:09.140 --> 36:15.500]  the kids use a combination of like Chromebooks and mostly Chromebooks I think other than
[36:15.500 --> 36:18.460]  now that he's older, he can bring his own device, but like when they were younger, it
[36:18.460 --> 36:24.520]  was a bunch of Chromebooks, but the teachers had Mac books.
[36:24.520 --> 36:26.300]  And so that make, that was interesting to me.
[36:26.300 --> 36:29.220]  And the other thing that I thought was so interesting about this was that they said
[36:29.220 --> 36:37.360]  that the Mac version of classroom isn't out now and won't be out even in beta and it'll
[36:37.360 --> 36:43.340]  be out in beta in June.
[36:43.340 --> 36:50.660]  And a friend of the show, Manton Reese observed, just idly speculating on a Slack that we're
[36:50.660 --> 36:57.500]  on that he thought, I wonder if maybe it's because the classroom for Mac is built using
[36:57.500 --> 37:08.380]  the Marzipan UI kit, that there's this rumor that Apple is working on a cross-platform
[37:08.380 --> 37:13.180]  to make it easier to do iOS and Mac apps that share a code base.
[37:13.180 --> 37:19.740]  And again, it was just, he doesn't work at Apple, but I thought it was a very keen observation
[37:19.740 --> 37:23.760]  and it certainly makes sense with why it would be beta in June.
[37:23.760 --> 37:27.740]  Because I asked Apple, if it's beta, why not just release it now?
[37:27.740 --> 37:36.060]  And the answer was just sort of like, it'll be out in beta in June, in a way that Apple
[37:36.060 --> 37:40.480]  has these non-answers ready to go for things they don't want to talk about.
[37:40.480 --> 37:45.120]  Because if it's going to be finished in June, okay, but then release the beta now.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.800]  But if it's going to be in beta in June anyway, why not release the beta now?
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.740]  And it would make sense if it's depending on some kind of OS update that will be announced
[37:54.740 --> 37:55.740]  at WWDC.
[37:55.740 --> 37:56.740]  Absolutely.
[37:56.740 --> 37:59.980]  And I think, I think Matt is spot on there.
[37:59.980 --> 38:01.580]  But I am excited that it's coming.
[38:01.580 --> 38:06.860]  Like I think that that's a, that's a really, and also, you know, going back to the demo
[38:06.860 --> 38:12.260]  really quickly, I thought it was very smart of them to show how you can do this in a shared
[38:12.260 --> 38:13.260]  environment.
[38:13.260 --> 38:14.260]  Right.
[38:14.260 --> 38:15.260]  It wasn't one to one there.
[38:15.260 --> 38:17.100]  It wasn't all students have their own iPad.
[38:17.100 --> 38:21.100]  Like I think Apple is very realistic about the fact where it's like, if we're going to
[38:21.100 --> 38:25.820]  charge $2.99 for devices in the education market, no, it's not going to be a one to
[38:25.820 --> 38:27.140]  one classroom.
[38:27.140 --> 38:31.240]  Most likely people are going to share during a class and most likely they're going to have
[38:31.240 --> 38:33.860]  to, you know, swap out between classes.
[38:33.860 --> 38:36.980]  You know, the kid is not just going to have the iPad and then it gets stored in their
[38:36.980 --> 38:40.860]  locker while they're not using it.
[38:40.860 --> 38:47.820]  I think it's very, very smart of them given the price restrictions.
[38:47.820 --> 38:48.820]  All right.
[38:48.820 --> 38:50.940]  Let me take another break here and thank our next sponsor.
[38:50.940 --> 38:54.940]  These guys were on the show a couple of weeks ago and I think they were really happy with
[38:54.940 --> 38:56.020]  the way that it went.
[38:56.020 --> 38:59.580]  It's Trace Pontas Coffee.
[38:59.580 --> 39:00.740]  Here's the deal.
[39:00.740 --> 39:04.640]  They sell freshly roasted gourmet coffee and they ship it directly to you.
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.500]  Their beans are roasted to order your order and shipped out immediately.
[39:08.500 --> 39:12.620]  So it's not like they roast it and then sits on a shelf somewhere for a week or two.
[39:12.620 --> 39:16.580]  And then when you order it, it ships to you like they print the date that it was roasted
[39:16.580 --> 39:17.580]  right on it.
[39:17.580 --> 39:22.120]  And, you know, I've gotten a couple of shipments from them already and it's literally within
[39:22.120 --> 39:23.120]  like days.
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.820]  And honestly, it makes a difference as a coffee, a bit of a coffee snob.
[39:27.820 --> 39:34.680]  It's like it coffee goes, it's more like fruit, you know, than people who are, you know, used
[39:34.680 --> 39:37.160]  to drink in Maxwell's or something would think.
[39:37.160 --> 39:39.780]  It goes bad quickly.
[39:39.780 --> 39:44.980]  So getting it delivered quickly, directly from them really makes a difference.
[39:44.980 --> 39:46.220]  There's not a lot of choices.
[39:46.220 --> 39:47.460]  They don't overwhelm you with choices.
[39:47.460 --> 39:51.780]  They have four roast profiles, but it's really just how dark of a roast it is.
[39:51.780 --> 39:54.700]  They've got light, medium, dark, and French roast.
[39:54.700 --> 40:00.540]  I've had all of them, pretty sure medium is what I like best.
[40:00.540 --> 40:01.720]  But that's me.
[40:01.720 --> 40:08.300]  If you like darker, more roasted coffee, you would, you know, you might think differently.
[40:08.300 --> 40:09.300]  So here's the deal.
[40:09.300 --> 40:15.620]  It's a single origin family down in Brazil and the, their family has owned this coffee
[40:15.620 --> 40:24.180]  plantation for generations and only have recently begun selling to United States.
[40:24.180 --> 40:28.120]  Previously they had been selling all of their coffee to local roasters in Brazil.
[40:28.120 --> 40:31.620]  So it's the first time they've ever exported their coffee to the United States.
[40:31.620 --> 40:36.140]  So you can get Brazilian coffee now when you couldn't before.
[40:36.140 --> 40:37.260]  And it's really, really great.
[40:37.260 --> 40:41.520]  There's so much information at their website about the farm and about how it's all sustainable
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.340]  and about how everybody who works there is taken care of.
[40:44.340 --> 40:48.480]  It's a really good company that really cares for their employees.
[40:48.480 --> 40:53.280]  And just honest, selfishly, fresh coffee tastes great.
[40:53.280 --> 40:54.280]  And so here's the deal.
[40:54.280 --> 40:58.500]  You can go there and just buy some coffee to try it and where you can go.
[40:58.500 --> 40:59.500]  There's two ways to do it.
[40:59.500 --> 41:08.220]  You can go to tracepontas.com, T-R-E-S, P-O-N-T-A-S.com slash coffee.
[41:08.220 --> 41:10.420]  You can go there and find out.
[41:10.420 --> 41:14.980]  The other way is you can go to Amazon and search for tracepontas and their coffee will
[41:14.980 --> 41:16.480]  be the first thing that you buy.
[41:16.480 --> 41:20.220]  But even when you buy on Amazon, your coffee comes from tracepontas.
[41:20.220 --> 41:23.180]  They're just using Amazon as a front end for the orders.
[41:23.180 --> 41:27.300]  It's not sitting there on a big shelf in a warehouse that Amazon owns or something like
[41:27.300 --> 41:28.300]  that.
[41:28.300 --> 41:31.680]  They're using their coffee and they're encouraging me to tell you if you'd rather buy from Amazon
[41:31.680 --> 41:33.980]  for the convenience of checking out, do it.
[41:33.980 --> 41:39.180]  You're getting the exact same coffee as if you go to tracepontas.com.
[41:39.180 --> 41:43.340]  And you get free shipping in the US regardless of which way you order it.
[41:43.340 --> 41:45.700]  I don't know how they do that, but it's amazing.
[41:45.700 --> 41:49.140]  So on the tracepontas.com website, you can sign up for a coffee subscription.
[41:49.140 --> 41:52.420]  This is a special deal for listeners of the show and get freshly roasted beans sent to
[41:52.420 --> 41:54.180]  you every one, two or four weeks.
[41:54.180 --> 41:55.180]  Your choice.
[41:55.180 --> 42:01.500]  I'm a two, two week person because nobody else in the house drinks coffee and one bag
[42:01.500 --> 42:04.420]  every two weeks is perfect.
[42:04.420 --> 42:11.020]  And when you sign up for a subscription, you'll save 10% on every bag by using the code, the
[42:11.020 --> 42:16.280]  talk show at checkout and that the coffee subscription is 10% off for anybody.
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.220]  But if you use that code, the talk show, you get an extra 10% off and you'll save 20% off
[42:21.220 --> 42:24.820]  every bag of coffee in your subscription for as long as you have the subscription.
[42:24.820 --> 42:27.260]  So you could save 20% for years at a time.
[42:27.260 --> 42:28.260]  So my thanks to them.
[42:28.260 --> 42:33.380]  I've just finished as we were talking to show it sometime, sometime around the first sponsor
[42:33.380 --> 42:37.500]  break is when I finished a cup of their coffee and it's delicious.
[42:37.500 --> 42:38.500]  It's really good.
[42:38.500 --> 42:39.500]  So my thanks to trace Puntas.
[42:39.500 --> 42:40.500]  Check them out.
[42:40.500 --> 42:41.500]  All right.
[42:41.500 --> 42:46.900]  Here's my, the next thing I want to talk about before, before I forget is this feature.
[42:46.900 --> 42:52.180]  It's this feature that is not new, but somehow I missed last year when it shipped, which
[42:52.180 --> 42:55.780]  is that these education iPads have multiple sign-on.
[42:55.780 --> 43:01.760]  So like you said, a class could have like just a stack of 10 iPads and the kids just
[43:01.760 --> 43:08.440]  come up and pick one up and they, they can just select their, you know, it'll be set
[43:08.440 --> 43:09.580]  up for the class already.
[43:09.580 --> 43:13.220]  So it'd have a list of all the kids in the class and then you tap your name and you're
[43:13.220 --> 43:21.500]  signed into your stuff and then when the class is over, we shouldn't, we should know it right.
[43:21.500 --> 43:22.500]  Does it use touch ID?
[43:22.500 --> 43:23.620]  I don't even know.
[43:23.620 --> 43:26.300]  I'm not sure if it's such a, I think it's a passcode.
[43:26.300 --> 43:30.540]  Yeah, I think it can't use touch ID because that, yeah, that couldn't be shared between
[43:30.540 --> 43:33.340]  iPads cause it's secure enclave.
[43:33.340 --> 43:36.700]  But I think presumably because they're locked down in other ways, they don't really need
[43:36.700 --> 43:38.420]  that much authentication.
[43:38.420 --> 43:39.600]  You know what I mean?
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.580]  Like you don't have to really worry about that.
[43:43.580 --> 43:45.600]  But here's, so it's a neat feature.
[43:45.600 --> 43:48.700]  The iPads that we got to demo were set up using it.
[43:48.700 --> 43:50.100]  I thought it was really cool.
[43:50.100 --> 43:53.820]  But my question is how come that this feature hasn't made it to consumers yet?
[43:53.820 --> 44:02.020]  Cause I think that a family iPad is a thing people would want to have like an iPad that
[44:02.020 --> 44:08.620]  just stays on the living room coffee table and anybody in the family can pick it up and
[44:08.620 --> 44:09.620]  use it.
[44:09.620 --> 44:11.240]  And when they use it, it's them.
[44:11.240 --> 44:18.140]  So their I messages are coming in, it's their email they're seeing, you know, I've, I've,
[44:18.140 --> 44:22.860]  there's a platform called the Mac that has had this feature ever since, uh, macro is
[44:22.860 --> 44:28.880]  10 years in 2001 where you can have multiple user accounts on one device and then you could
[44:28.880 --> 44:33.980]  have like a shared iMac and you just log out and then, you know, somebody, you know, somebody
[44:33.980 --> 44:37.020]  else in your household can log in.
[44:37.020 --> 44:41.540]  This seems like a feature, uh, number one, I know it's a feature people want on iPads,
[44:41.540 --> 44:46.600]  but it seems like they, they kind of have it working for this classroom.
[44:46.600 --> 44:51.020]  I think they have it working on the software side, but I gotta, I gotta assume that Apple
[44:51.020 --> 44:55.900]  does not want to implement it until it can either make the secure enclave big enough
[44:55.900 --> 45:03.000]  or secure enough so that you can register touch ID and or face ID matches for everyone
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  in your family.
[45:04.000 --> 45:10.960]  Because I think when it comes to classwork, right, um, obviously passcodes are important,
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.900]  but I don't think they're as concerned as we have to protect individual people's data
[45:16.900 --> 45:22.180]  because that iPad, we look at everything that's happening politically and everything that's
[45:22.180 --> 45:26.820]  happening security wise lately, you know, that iPad may just live in your living room,
[45:26.820 --> 45:29.480]  but there's also a chance that you might bring that iPad on a trip.
[45:29.480 --> 45:34.300]  And if that iPad gets lost, I don't think they, Apple wants the responsibility of only
[45:34.300 --> 45:40.600]  having a four or six digit passcode on your, you know, on your iPad for somebody to crack
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.940]  and then get access to your banking information or your kid's health records.
[45:44.940 --> 45:52.180]  For instance, you know, I think that's my, that's my non-educated like presumption as
[45:52.180 --> 45:56.180]  to why it hasn't shown up because clearly, yeah, they have the software, the software
[45:56.180 --> 46:01.300]  seems to work really well and people use it on their Macs and people definitely would
[46:01.300 --> 46:07.920]  use it on iPads because I, you know, I think that for a lot of families, I mean, I guess
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.140]  it would vary, but I think for some families, you don't need, you know, it's a lot like
[46:12.140 --> 46:15.940]  a classroom where you don't really need a one to one iPad to family members.
[46:15.940 --> 46:19.340]  No, maybe Apple just wants people to buy iPads.
[46:19.340 --> 46:20.340]  Right.
[46:20.340 --> 46:26.900]  Well, that's the cynical answer is that they, they, they want you to buy one to one.
[46:26.900 --> 46:28.640]  Everybody gets an iPad.
[46:28.640 --> 46:31.540]  You get an iPad and you get an iPad.
[46:31.540 --> 46:36.180]  You know, it's possible that that's the explanation.
[46:36.180 --> 46:39.980]  Lower on that point, I will say this is why, why did Apple hold this event?
[46:39.980 --> 46:44.900]  I think, and I forget what was a Boeing Boeing, somebody at Boeing Boeing wrote a pretty snarky
[46:44.900 --> 46:49.540]  article article, pretty much trying to argue that all Apple does is all they want is the
[46:49.540 --> 46:51.740]  money from the schools for iPads.
[46:51.740 --> 46:57.420]  And I don't think that's the case because you know, they're not there.
[46:57.420 --> 47:01.100]  It's true that they're not giving away these iPads, you know, they are charging schools
[47:01.100 --> 47:03.860]  $299 for each of them.
[47:03.860 --> 47:09.060]  But it is they're by far they're their lowest price iPad.
[47:09.060 --> 47:15.360]  It's it's not, you know, it's not robbing people of feature like this iPad is probably
[47:15.360 --> 47:21.300]  this is the first time I've ever recommended the base model iPad over an iPad Pro since
[47:21.300 --> 47:27.580]  the pros got released in part because like the processor is solid and Apple pencil support
[47:27.580 --> 47:32.860]  is huge and no, the display isn't laminated, but you know, you can you can sacrifice some
[47:32.860 --> 47:33.860]  things for it.
[47:33.860 --> 47:34.860]  Yeah, exactly.
[47:34.860 --> 47:38.840]  It's like these are things that have been nice to have.
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.720]  But in order to get the price that low, I mean, we got to think about when where these
[47:43.720 --> 47:45.180]  iPads started, right?
[47:45.180 --> 47:47.900]  Like 499599 price points.
[47:47.900 --> 47:55.640]  It's indisputably a way better display than you get on a Mac 999 MacBook Air because fat
[47:55.640 --> 47:56.880]  still doesn't have retina.
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.900]  So it's a phenomenally better display than a MacBook Air.
[48:02.900 --> 48:08.940]  I mean, I guess you could argue that the MacBook Air being 13 inches is better for some things,
[48:08.940 --> 48:13.220]  but I think most people would agree that on the whole, that's no comparison, which has
[48:13.220 --> 48:19.100]  a better display, and it's only to 329 and the whole show, they really they never even
[48:19.100 --> 48:25.500]  mentioned iPad Pro there, there was no insinuation of Oh, and you could do this on an iPad Pro.
[48:25.500 --> 48:29.980]  You know, it's it was entirely geared towards selling schools $299 iPads.
[48:29.980 --> 48:35.720]  Yeah, and not even school, I think just just customers in general, who might want to do
[48:35.720 --> 48:40.860]  education based things on their iPad, or just have a smart iPad that allows them to do a
[48:40.860 --> 48:44.440]  lot of different sub like work on a lot of different subjects.
[48:44.440 --> 48:49.440]  Like this, this iPad, in my opinion, like it may be geared towards schools with pencil
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.700]  support and a faster processor and everything else that comes along with it.
[48:53.700 --> 48:59.000]  But this iPad is indisputably this is this is the iPad that's going to weasel its way
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.440]  into a bunch of people's lives.
[49:01.440 --> 49:06.560]  Because I honestly, I honestly think Apple, it bothers Apple, that schools are moving
[49:06.560 --> 49:11.340]  towards piece of shit Chromebooks, and that they just think that it's just wrong.
[49:11.340 --> 49:15.340]  You know that, you know, we should be giving our kids the best experience they can they
[49:15.340 --> 49:22.980]  can have and having a junky little $129 you know, Chromebook that only all it does is
[49:22.980 --> 49:24.940]  show browser tabs.
[49:24.940 --> 49:27.140]  It's just I just think it doesn't sit right with them.
[49:27.140 --> 49:28.700]  I really don't think it's about the money.
[49:28.700 --> 49:32.140]  And I think I think it's questionable whether this is going to work.
[49:32.140 --> 49:35.220]  I'm not sure that they can turn this around this trend around.
[49:35.220 --> 49:38.740]  But it's fascinating to me to see Apple try that they care.
[49:38.740 --> 49:43.900]  And I think even if it's as successful as it could possibly be like, however successful
[49:43.900 --> 49:51.300]  this renewed push into education with this focus on the new 9.7 inch iPad, for lack of
[49:51.300 --> 49:57.300]  a better name, and Apple pencil, and some additional pencil, you know, enabled apps.
[49:57.300 --> 50:02.740]  If it's as successful as it can possibly be, I don't, I still don't think it's a meaningful
[50:02.740 --> 50:04.180]  amount of revenue to Apple.
[50:04.180 --> 50:09.440]  No, I really not meaning less, I guess, but it's not it's not really it really can't be
[50:09.440 --> 50:10.440]  about the money.
[50:10.440 --> 50:11.980]  It's it's just not a big enough.
[50:11.980 --> 50:13.180]  It's not a big enough market.
[50:13.180 --> 50:19.260]  And it's not a high enough price product when they're selling 70 gazillion, you know, $1,100
[50:19.260 --> 50:21.380]  iPhone 10s, you know, in a quarter.
[50:21.380 --> 50:22.380]  Oh, of course.
[50:22.380 --> 50:26.340]  Well, and I think it's also worth noting that their education, you know, this is not something
[50:26.340 --> 50:28.780]  that Apple necessarily publicizes.
[50:28.780 --> 50:34.360]  But their education page does say, you know, we'll work with schools on licensing on fees,
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.060]  if you you know, want to rent the iPads instead of buy the iPads, and we can work with you
[50:38.060 --> 50:43.000]  on purchasing programs, if you are, you know, if you're if your school district doesn't
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.300]  have the money to just shell out hundreds of these, like, I think Apple, and this is
[50:48.300 --> 50:53.180]  the really interesting thing to me about Apple as a company is that most companies if they
[50:53.180 --> 50:59.900]  do what we've called, you know, social social good in the world, you get 10 million press
[50:59.900 --> 51:00.900]  releases about it.
[51:00.900 --> 51:02.140]  And Apple is not immune to this.
[51:02.140 --> 51:06.260]  I mean, as we can see from their educate or their their environmental press releases,
[51:06.260 --> 51:11.540]  but like, I would say the vast majority of the little wins that Apple does for the for
[51:11.540 --> 51:17.100]  the community never get publicized, like or if they get publicized, they get publicized
[51:17.100 --> 51:22.700]  because somebody at Apple is really happy about it and leaks it to somebody so that
[51:22.700 --> 51:24.060]  they'll actually know.
[51:24.060 --> 51:29.860]  Like, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple like, we were talking, I was talking with Jason
[51:29.860 --> 51:35.180]  before the before the event about like, oh, all of these lights that are in the auditorium,
[51:35.180 --> 51:36.380]  this is crazy.
[51:36.380 --> 51:40.060]  And someone on Twitter was snarking is like, well, if Apple really cared about the school,
[51:40.060 --> 51:41.940]  they would donate those lights.
[51:41.940 --> 51:46.820]  And I'm like, we don't know that they didn't like, just because Apple didn't put out a
[51:46.820 --> 51:52.860]  press release saying like, all right, we just spent $30,000 on this school, like, I think
[51:52.860 --> 51:56.740]  they're doing a lot of good in the education market that we just never hear about.
[51:56.740 --> 52:00.620]  Because it's little projects, you know, it's like at that Atlanta, Georgia school, like,
[52:00.620 --> 52:04.940]  I can't imagine a low income Atlanta, Georgia school is shelling out for 30 iPads, like
[52:04.940 --> 52:08.860]  I have to believe that Apple is genuinely committed here.
[52:08.860 --> 52:09.860]  Yeah.
[52:09.860 --> 52:17.540]  One thing I heard behind the scenes, and it's secondhand, so it's, you know, I don't know.
[52:17.540 --> 52:27.020]  But I heard that it part of this renewed, sort of 2.0 take on books, or iPads for education
[52:27.020 --> 52:32.060]  with 1.0 being started a couple years back at the Guggenheim show, I think it was like
[52:32.060 --> 52:33.060]  2014.
[52:33.060 --> 52:34.060]  2015.
[52:34.060 --> 52:36.820]  Four years ago, 14.
[52:36.820 --> 52:37.820]  Yeah.
[52:37.820 --> 52:44.860]  And that one of the ways that they're rethinking this approach is a focus on, it's sort of
[52:44.860 --> 52:51.060]  the upending the pyramid of sales, right, where if you remember, like 2015, or so there
[52:51.060 --> 52:56.500]  were a lot of these announcements, like LA school district buys 60,000 iPads.
[52:56.500 --> 52:58.500]  Yeah.
[52:58.500 --> 53:02.180]  And there were stories that came out later that a lot of these schools were unhappy with
[53:02.180 --> 53:06.140]  it, that it was hard to manage that the management tools, you know, that, you know, there just
[53:06.140 --> 53:09.900]  wasn't cut out to manage 60,000 iPads, etc.
[53:09.900 --> 53:13.620]  And that they're really doing it the other way this time, where they're really focusing
[53:13.620 --> 53:20.620]  on just like selling 30 iPads to several thousand schools, as opposed to selling 60,000 to one
[53:20.620 --> 53:23.380]  school district.
[53:23.380 --> 53:26.340]  You know, it's a much smaller approach.
[53:26.340 --> 53:31.400]  But that they, you know, obviously hope would multiply by the number of schools that can
[53:31.400 --> 53:32.400]  do it.
[53:32.400 --> 53:34.660]  Yeah, I honestly think that's the better way to do it.
[53:34.660 --> 53:39.020]  Because especially if you think about what they were talking about in their keynote,
[53:39.020 --> 53:43.500]  you know, it was all these stories about individual classrooms and individual teachers.
[53:43.500 --> 53:47.100]  It wasn't like, oh, this school district has adopted our things.
[53:47.100 --> 53:48.580]  And now they've seen great success.
[53:48.580 --> 53:53.060]  It's like, no, let's, let's actually tell you what, you know, your your teacher next
[53:53.060 --> 53:54.740]  door is doing with this product.
[53:54.740 --> 54:00.380]  And it reminds me a lot of how the early Mac sold, you know, in terms of like, yeah, this
[54:00.380 --> 54:06.420]  is Mac paint, look at someone paint a picture, you know, not not look at the, you know, overwhelming
[54:06.420 --> 54:12.620]  power of this beautiful battle station iPad, it's, it's it's personal in a way that it
[54:12.620 --> 54:14.580]  hasn't been in a while.
[54:14.580 --> 54:18.020]  When I was in elementary school, we didn't have a lot of computers.
[54:18.020 --> 54:22.780]  And I think that the ones we did in hindsight, were all sort of spearheaded by individual
[54:22.780 --> 54:26.460]  I don't know that they I don't think the teachers spent their own money, although in one case,
[54:26.460 --> 54:32.460]  I think he did that it was like his computer in the back of the classroom.
[54:32.460 --> 54:37.820]  But a couple of the teachers who did have computers in their classroom had the ti 99
[54:37.820 --> 54:44.660]  for a and you know, it's it was sort of the Chromebook of the day because it was a lot
[54:44.660 --> 54:48.820]  cheaper than an Apple two.
[54:48.820 --> 54:54.460]  But when I first saw an Apple to II, I just I love you know, of course, unsurprisingly,
[54:54.460 --> 54:59.060]  I was I would, I would do anything and everything I could to get as much time on any computer
[54:59.060 --> 55:02.220]  in any classroom that I possibly could.
[55:02.220 --> 55:10.980]  But when I first saw the Apple to II, I was just like, Oh, this, this, this is the right
[55:10.980 --> 55:16.280]  and it was was like and you know, had a better keyboard.
[55:16.280 --> 55:19.980]  Everything was nicer about it.
[55:19.980 --> 55:24.540]  And I, you know, I just think back to the teachers that, you know, it's probably why
[55:24.540 --> 55:28.900]  I mean, maybe different kids from my school had different favorite teachers, but like
[55:28.900 --> 55:34.740]  Mr. Leinbach was our fifth grade social studies and math teacher, and he had the ti 99 for
[55:34.740 --> 55:36.700]  a in the back of his classroom.
[55:36.700 --> 55:40.940]  He was one of my favorite teachers of grade school, he was just, you know, he's everything
[55:40.940 --> 55:45.020]  you would want a teacher he, you know, he was funny, he was engaged, he got to know
[55:45.020 --> 55:49.460]  every kid, you know, he really, you know, and, and I just, you know, would remember
[55:49.460 --> 55:55.380]  that he would, he would, he wouldn't let like the shy kids just pass through unnoticed like
[55:55.380 --> 55:59.920]  he'd make, you know, he'd make a point of engaging them.
[55:59.920 --> 56:05.620]  And I think that's the type of teacher apples still focused on is, you know, sort of enabling
[56:05.620 --> 56:10.740]  the star teachers to, to do the awesome stuff that they can do even, you know, because let's
[56:10.740 --> 56:15.260]  face it, it's, you know, not every teacher, you know, not every teacher is great.
[56:15.260 --> 56:20.300]  Not every not every teacher wants to go above and beyond and, and not even because they
[56:20.300 --> 56:21.300]  don't care.
[56:21.300 --> 56:24.580]  It's just sometimes, you know, you're, you're teaching seven classes.
[56:24.580 --> 56:28.240]  I think they're just they're just or they're just not that good.
[56:28.240 --> 56:33.220]  To be honest, I know, I know, I'd like to believe that you don't go into teaching without,
[56:33.220 --> 56:35.220]  you know, wanting to make kids lives better.
[56:35.220 --> 56:40.740]  But I also understand like, there's, there's there are other factors, but I really detected
[56:40.740 --> 56:43.880]  that in Apple's event that this was about and they, you know, they even featured them
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.580]  in the videos and had a couple of them come on stage.
[56:49.580 --> 56:54.340]  I will also say, I think, I don't know, I don't, I don't know if somebody kept track,
[56:54.340 --> 57:00.260]  but I believe that that was the single highest ratio of women to men at an Apple event ever
[57:00.260 --> 57:03.940]  by a long shot because the track john, what's that?
[57:03.940 --> 57:05.340]  I said, I kept track.
[57:05.340 --> 57:06.340]  All right.
[57:06.340 --> 57:10.300]  So what was the I believe that the only two men who were on stage were Tim Cook and jaws
[57:10.300 --> 57:11.300]  right?
[57:11.300 --> 57:12.300]  Jaws.
[57:12.300 --> 57:13.300]  Yep.
[57:13.300 --> 57:14.300]  And that was a woman.
[57:14.300 --> 57:18.100]  And I, I personally think that's fantastic.
[57:18.100 --> 57:21.980]  I know some people who are being again, kind of cynical about it being like, well, that's
[57:21.980 --> 57:25.060]  because women are primarily in education.
[57:25.060 --> 57:27.820]  And that just says bad things about our education market.
[57:27.820 --> 57:33.340]  And I'm like, we can acknowledge simultaneously that there are issues in education, while
[57:33.340 --> 57:39.220]  also commending Apple for going out of its way to put women on stage, and not just women,
[57:39.220 --> 57:44.900]  women of color, women of different ages, you know, different sizes, shapes, like I just
[57:44.900 --> 57:52.220]  I think any any chance to give women the mic when they haven't been on like competent women,
[57:52.220 --> 57:55.820]  I just, you know, they're not just throwing people up there who happen to have a female
[57:55.820 --> 57:59.780]  gender, like they're just, they are showing, oh, these people are in education and are
[57:59.780 --> 58:03.060]  really smart and doing really wonderful things like that.
[58:03.060 --> 58:04.660]  That's the important part there.
[58:04.660 --> 58:09.700]  Right, and, you know, and include it, but also including Apple employees like Susan
[58:09.700 --> 58:10.700]  Prescott.
[58:10.700 --> 58:11.700]  Yes.
[58:11.700 --> 58:12.700]  Susan Prescott.
[58:12.700 --> 58:14.260]  Who's amazing.
[58:14.260 --> 58:20.220]  She is, you know, and you could totally see how she is like a very high level VP and product
[58:20.220 --> 58:21.620]  marketing group.
[58:21.620 --> 58:26.100]  But she'd like, she like knows those apps don't call like, she's really, really good.
[58:26.100 --> 58:27.100]  Oh, yeah.
[58:27.100 --> 58:28.100]  Without question.
[58:28.100 --> 58:31.180]  She's, she's such a great presenter, and I'm so glad that we got to see her on stage.
[58:31.180 --> 58:35.100]  But yeah, I mean, like, it's interesting, because, you know, Apple doesn't just have
[58:35.100 --> 58:40.140]  three schools that they have iPads in, like, I'm sure they have hundreds, if not thousands.
[58:40.140 --> 58:45.820]  So they had, they probably had tons of well spoken teachers to choose from.
[58:45.820 --> 58:50.340]  And the fact that they went out of their way, I, that really meant a lot to me, again, in
[58:50.340 --> 58:56.020]  education, like, it's nice to see people who are not only doing really interesting things,
[58:56.020 --> 58:59.660]  but also who are a little bit different from the voices that we usually hear on stage talking
[58:59.660 --> 59:00.660]  about STEM.
[59:00.660 --> 59:06.580]  So that was really, I thought it was, yeah, I thought and it was a solid event to in so
[59:06.580 --> 59:11.340]  far as they did, because they didn't have a lot of news to announce.
[59:11.340 --> 59:14.420]  It was an hour in and out.
[59:14.420 --> 59:17.260]  And didn't feel like it was a minute too long.
[59:17.260 --> 59:23.260]  And it's a discipline that most tech companies don't have, like, most tech companies, if
[59:23.260 --> 59:29.140]  they have a little bit of news, they're still going to take two hours for their about themselves.
[59:29.140 --> 59:31.220]  Right?
[59:31.220 --> 59:35.500]  They can't help themselves, because it's like a political thing that somehow, Apple has
[59:35.500 --> 59:41.340]  continued to manage culturally within the company after, you know, without Steve Jobs,
[59:41.340 --> 59:46.020]  that they're still, it's so obvious at some events, how the politics played out, where
[59:46.020 --> 59:49.180]  it's like, well, you've got to get if you're going to give, you know, the guy from Google
[59:49.180 --> 59:53.460]  Docs this much time at, you know, what's Google's developer conference?
[59:53.460 --> 59:55.940]  Oh, it X now.
[59:55.940 --> 59:59.540]  I Oh, I Oh, thank you.
[59:59.540 --> 01:00:02.060]  Yeah, I was like, that's not right.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.460]  No, we got to give the we got to give the Gmail team some time.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.440]  So we got to, you know, here, and it's, you can just see the politics playing out on stage
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.140]  by who's up there and for how long.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.060]  And you really just don't see that at an Apple event.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.620]  No, it's it's in and out.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:22.580]  I think the last thing I kind of want to say on this is just as somebody who the the whole
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:28.760]  reason why I am doing what I'm doing today is because I got hooked on Macs and hooked
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.260]  on computers early.
[01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:35.100]  And a big force was that was not only my teachers, but actually my dad, like my dad who worked
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:42.900]  at Caltech, essentially got Caltech to donate 30 Mac pluses to my elementary school, like
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:46.960]  because we had these janky, horrible DOS machines.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.180]  And he not only like he got all of this.
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.020]  And then when he did it, the school was like, no, we don't have anybody who's going to teach
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.020]  them.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.020]  Like, no one knows how to use them.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:57.660]  So we're not going to like we're not going to accept this.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:02.400]  And he's like, all right, what if I also donate my time as a teacher and like teach these
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.180]  kids how to use this?
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:10.180]  And no joke, for the next five years, five, six years, my dad was volunteer.
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.780]  I think maybe he got paid the last year.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.860]  But otherwise, he was a volunteer computer teacher for like four or five years for the
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:24.080]  L.A. County School District and like or Pasadena School District, like helping, helping kids
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.500]  learn how to use Macs.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.380]  And I'm like, I have no doubt.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.380]  That's amazing.
[01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.380]  That's truly amazing.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.980]  But that's the kind of thing is like, I know there are people out there right now who are
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.860]  doing that with iPads and doing that with computer.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.820]  Like you said, it's like it's it's the people who go above and beyond.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.300]  And they really do make a difference in people's lives.
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.100]  Like my dad made a difference in my life for many reasons.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:51.220]  But like that, that is a chief one of why I'm why I'm reporting on Apple these days.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:55.340]  I've told this story before, but it's to me, it's evergreen and it feels like a natural
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.000]  point to bring it up, which is that I never owned a computer until I went to college.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.800]  And I desperately wanted one from the moment I first encountered.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]  We did.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]  You know, we had like an Atari.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.460]  We had a video game system, but I couldn't get a computer, but I only wanted an Apple.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:17.740]  I didn't want to settle for like a Commodore 64 and they were expensive.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:22.380]  And my parents didn't really, you know, but the funny thing is that most of my friends
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.460]  who wanted to get a computer, the argument from their parents would be, I'm not spending
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.580]  all that money on a computer.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.780]  You're never going to play it or you're only going to play games.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.420]  You know, you're not going to use it.
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.300]  My parents argument for not buying me a computer was that if we buy you a computer, you're
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.460]  never going to leave the house.
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.100]  I was so irrationally angry.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:44.260]  I'm like, you're not, you're even admitting that I'm going to get, you know, however much
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.260]  it costs you.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:50.100]  I'm going to get every penny of value out of this and you won't buy this thing for me
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.380]  that I'm, and I'm still thinking about it like every day.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:58.220]  That wouldn't be like a day of my life, like, like, I don't know, third, fourth grade on
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:06.900]  where I didn't think, boy, I wish I had a computer every day in hindsight though, I,
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:12.100]  I'm still, I still don't agree with their decision, but I do agree with the fact that
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.460]  they were probably right that I wouldn't have left the house.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.460]  I know.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.980]  I definitely, uh, there's definitely a significant portion of my social life that was spent on
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.740]  my iMac and on my iBook, not, not in real life.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.860]  So yeah, I, I agree.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.620]  I think I've told this story before too.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:35.440]  So like in, in between 10th and 11th grades, our high school, our, it was a small public
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.880]  school district and they had back in, in like the seventies through like the mid eighties,
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:47.060]  they had three schools in elementary school, a middle school and a high school and population
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.380]  dwindled a bit.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:53.100]  Uh, and so they closed the middle school and just had one to six, went to the elementary
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.500]  school, seven to 12, went to the now called junior senior high school.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:03.380]  Um, and between 10th and 11th grade, they switched buildings for the junior senior high
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:09.060]  school from the old high school building to the shuttered for a decade, former middle
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:12.140]  school because the roof was so leaky.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:17.860]  Like that's literally how public education works where it seems so it was, seemed so
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.680]  daunting to fix their leaky roof that they literally moved the school from one building
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.940]  to another and they hired a bunch of kids.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:29.340]  I was, my summer job was helping to move the school, but, but the computer teacher did
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.720]  Mrs. Spat who was a fantastic teacher, one of my, you know, really a truly, uh, ran a
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.340]  great high school, junior high school computer science program for a public school.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.580]  Um, and, and look where I am, you know, obviously, you know, she did something right.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:51.700]  Um, but she, she was worried about letting like movers move the computers.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.820]  So she let, uh, she let some of the kids who she trusted take them home for the summer.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:02.580]  So I got to take an Apple, I got to take an Apple two GS home for the summer, um, cause
[01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:07.260]  she trusted me more to take good care of it and then bring it back in September.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:12.340]  And so I had an Apple two GS for the summer and I like, it was like on it, like every
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:18.620]  waking moment that I could, and my parents were like, see, that's why we didn't want
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:25.420]  to buy you one of these things there again, they're not wrong, but, but I'm sure you got
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.220]  a great use out of it that summer.
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.380]  Oh, I love that computer.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.100]  What a great, what a great computer that was.
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.580]  Um, all right, let me take one last break here.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.620]  Thank our third and final sponsor, uh, Squarespace.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.860]  Look, Squarespace sponsors this show all the time, right?
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.860]  You know what they do.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:47.780]  You go there, you can sign up, make a website, you can get your domain name, you pick templates,
[01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.580]  uh, you can customize them out the wazoo.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.740]  I'm telling you right now though, it is the best way to start, especially for if you don't
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:05.180]  want to be like, uh, on the hook for keeping somebody else's website up to date.
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:08.780]  Like, so if like, you know, think about it, you're listening to the talk show, you're
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.220]  a nerd really.
[01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.820]  So you're probably the person who like when the non-technical people in your life, whether
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:17.060]  they're in your family, whether they're friends, when they have something where they need to
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.940]  make a website or maybe it's like a community group, like your church or a school group
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.020]  or something like that, or a neighborhood type thing, uh, they probably, you're probably
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.500]  the one who's like on the hook for this.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:34.780]  I'm telling you, you Squarespace for this because it's a easy B requires no technical
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.780]  knowledge.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.780]  So anybody can do it.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:41.140]  It's just all drag and drop to, to set stuff up, rearrange it, get it the way you want
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.340]  it.
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.580]  And if anybody actually does need help for something, they can just contact Squarespace
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:52.140]  Squarespace has literally award winning technical support and they're used to dealing with non-technical
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:53.140]  people.
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:58.780]  Uh, it's, it's, you know, the, the service itself is great, but the technical support
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.060]  is amazing.
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:05.240]  Uh, and it's not something people expect because we're, we've moved on to this world where
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.540]  people don't even expect that, that you can like call for technical support.
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.580]  Like who do you call to get technical support from Twitter?
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580]  Guess what?
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.100]  There is no, they don't even have like a phone hooked up.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.260]  Uh, Squarespace really takes it seriously.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:24.660]  Uh, and it's, it's really one of the, probably the most underrated part of the whole Squarespace
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.460]  success story is how good their tech support is.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.940]  So the next time you need to make a website, whether it's for yourself or, uh, somebody,
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:38.700]  you know, do it with Squarespace, just give it an hour and try and see how far you can
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.660]  go and how nice you can get it and how, how much you can make it just the way you want
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:42.660]  it to be.
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:48.420]  Uh, and when you do go, when you pay, you can go there, go to squarespace.com and you
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:52.420]  get, uh, you get a free trial for third, I think 30 days.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:55.320]  And then when you do pay, you get a free trial at squarespace.com.
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:01.180]  When you do pay, just remember the code talk show, no, the just talk show and you'll get
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.980]  10% off your first purchase.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:07.980]  Uh, my thanks to Squarespace for their continued support of the talk show.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.220]  Oh, all right.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.220]  Here's another one.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.620]  Let's do it, uh, on along the lines of why do education iPad users get multiple sign-ins
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:23.260]  and consumers don't, um, and I'm stealing this from you from our shared note.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:27.660]  This was actually your observation, but I'm taking credit for it is how come education
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:34.700]  users get their base storage for iCloud bumped to 200 gigabytes and everybody else is stuck
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.000]  at five gigabytes.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.540]  I'm still cranky about this.
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.380]  I'm sure it's coming at dub dub DC.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.260]  I'm sure it's going to be part of some iCloud announcement and it's maybe it's not even
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:46.260]  going to be too, maybe it's going to be like, everybody's going to have a terabyte free
[01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:50.180]  now cause we need to keep up with Dropbox and Google.
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:55.620]  Um, but I'm sure they want to do it like that and they didn't want to muddy up their, their
[01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:57.820]  education announcement with a consumer announcement.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.540]  So until then we suffer.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.180]  Right, right.
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:07.700]  I hope so because, and, and Molten, I always joke when he's on that, you know, the entire
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:14.540]  tech punditry class, uh, is an expert at spending other companies money, you know, like we call
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.460]  it spending Tim Cook's money.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:21.940]  Uh, so it is easy to say Apple, you know, Apple is so successful, they have so much
[01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:25.900]  money they could afford to give people 200 gigabytes or whatever.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:31.100]  I realize it's not my money, but at this point, five gigabytes is so stingy.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.580]  It is, it feels so mean.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.380]  It doesn't, it's not even enough to back up anybody's iPhone at this point, especially
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.020]  with like a photo library.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.020]  Like nope.
[01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.020]  Right.
[01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:48.960]  It, it really, you know, like storage and Ram as they, you know, continue to grow, it's,
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.980]  it's silly thinking, you know, we're, we were just talking about like the, you know, our,
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.640]  our childhood days of, you know, using a Mac plus, you know, like what'd you have a Mac
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:04.960]  plus you said, yeah, uh, yeah, I had my class, yeah, probably had like two, two megabytes
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.420]  of Ram, maybe one megabyte of Ram.
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:11.140]  I think it's something like that crazy.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.620]  But at the time, at that time though, it was like, well, that's amazing because the original
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:23.380]  Mac only had 512 kilobytes of Ram, uh, it, everything grows, but it, there comes a point
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.260]  where you grow past it and you're like, well, how the hell did we ever use those for anything?
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.380]  Like thinking about like floppy disks and it's like, you just create like a pages document
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:35.220]  and then you drag some images in and you hit command S and you go and look and there it
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:40.060]  is and it's, you know, like six megabytes and you're like, well, what the hell if that's
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:43.940]  like, I just made like a word processing document, it's already six megabytes, there's hardly
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.100]  anything in it.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:49.260]  And a floppy disk was only a 1.4 megabytes.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:53.420]  And then, you know, other people are like 1.4, I remember 700 kilobyte floppies, you
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:11:00.620]  know, uh, five gigabytes for online storage feels like flop, like a floppy disk at this
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.620]  point, right?
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.580]  It just, it, we're shooting these, these devices have these magnificent cameras that shoot
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:12.740]  4k video, uh, it, I, I, it really stuck out.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.440]  That's one of the other points of the event where I was just like, come on.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.860]  And I guess you're right that they just didn't want to muddy an education event with a consumer
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:25.500]  event and WWDC will be here soon enough, but boy, I sure hope WWDC's keynote doesn't come
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.740]  and go without, uh, an announcement on that front.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:30.740]  Yeah.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:38.260]  It's, I mean, if it, if it does, then somebody, somebody done screwed up because, uh, yeah,
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.300]  it's, it's, it's past time Apple.
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.580]  Like it's not, we need that hard.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:43.740]  We need more storage.
[01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.780]  Everybody, everybody is, you know, and it's just such as, it's such a pressure point and
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.060]  people don't want to pay their, you know, so it's saying, Hey, it's not that expensive.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.020]  You know, just for like a dollar a month, you can get upgraded to a pretty good amount.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.020]  People aren't going to do it.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.020]  And it's, it's irrational.
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:02.260]  I admit it's irrational to buy an 11.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:08.780]  It's completely irrational to be happy to buy an $1,100 iPhone 10 and completely refuse
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.500]  to spend a dollar a month to upgrade your iCloud storage.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.100]  And then just, you know, I'll just, I'll just not have online backups.
[01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:19.260]  You know, it's, it's irrational, but that's the way people are.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.020]  People don't want to pay for stuff like this.
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:24.820]  They just don't, it just does not compute to them that they should have to pay for it.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.020]  And they don't really know what iCloud is.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.020]  Right?
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.940]  And the thing is they're like, I don't even know what the iCloud is.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.820]  What's what's my iCloud.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:39.060]  And that's sort of the nature of the well-designed system that iOS is that you don't really have
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.060]  to know.
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.780]  You don't have to understand, you know, what different buckets, you know, what's the difference
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:50.580]  in iCloud drive and your iCloud photo library and, and the other different things, ways
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.340]  that you interact with iCloud.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:57.700]  You don't really have to know about it, but it, that's why people don't want to pay for
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.700]  it.
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.700]  Cause they don't even know.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.700]  Yeah.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.700]  Well, exactly.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:05.140]  And it's not like Apple has made it very simple and they really could, they could just say,
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:09.700]  Hey, your files app, your iCloud library, your photo library is in there now.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.700]  Everything that you're paying for.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.740]  It's for files, pay for files, just like Dropbox, but for your Mac.
[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.940]  And it's like, especially with, you know what, have you tried the new pages and numbers and
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.180]  keynote updates yet?
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180]  I don't know.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:27.380]  I did jumping topics a little bit, but no, but I, I just got the notification.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:32.740]  Like, you know how, like when you first open one of those docs after one of those apps,
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:39.140]  after they have an update, they, they have, it's like, it is like Apple's version of sparkle,
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:43.580]  you know, the updates, you know, your app, but they can't, the apps can't update themselves.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.100]  Like you have to go to the app store.
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.980]  It's like, go to the app store.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:47.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:54.980]  It's I wish, I wish it would be easier to do that, but regardless, uh, pages is, I mean,
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:14:00.580]  I don't want to not knock on wood here, but like pages is functional right now and not
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.380]  just functional, like pages is pretty, pretty good.
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.180]  And then it's pretty good on the web too.
[01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:08.900]  And I tried collaboration and I didn't want to tear my hair out.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:13.980]  So uh, so I look at that and granted, I've only been using it for like two days.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.640]  There's still plenty of time for it to mess up and make me hate everything.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:22.700]  But like I look at that and I'm saying, okay, well, Apple clearly wants to put some time
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:29.220]  and you know, money into this, into investing, you know, perhaps making its, I work suite
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:34.500]  on par with something like office 365 or Google docs.
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:39.220]  Then it needs to have the easy storage system and the easy storage system space to keep
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.280]  up with it.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.980]  So it's like the 200 gigs, I think that's partially, yeah, they're making, it's partially,
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:50.280]  yeah, they're making, uh, they're making all kinds of, uh, movies and stuff like that.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.900]  But partially I think it's because now when you create a pages document, you automatically
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.100]  go into the files app first where it's just like, here's your files app.
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.980]  Where would you like to save this document?
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.940]  Um, and yeah, I don't know.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.500]  I think that that makes it a little bit easier to stomach and understand.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:12.300]  I'm intrigued by the new feature and key or not keynote pages where you can use the pencil
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.620]  to circle in or like to make like corrections.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:21.220]  So the demo example of course was a teacher correcting the student's paper and underlining
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:27.940]  a, uh, the first sentence of a, of a first word of a sentence that wasn't uppercase.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:32.820]  So underline it to show that that needs to be uppercase and then circling another word.
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:39.420]  But then as you make subsequent edits, those, those annotations aren't just, uh, at an X,
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.980]  Y coordinate on the page, they, you know, the same word that you underlined stays underlined
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:46.580]  as you enter like a new paragraph.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.580]  That's pretty cool.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.580]  It is.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580]  It's really cool.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:53.700]  And in theory, this is really, isn't all that much different than commenting on something,
[01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:54.700]  right?
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:58.540]  But what I really appreciate, and again, it's kind of, it's old school Apple where they're
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:04.140]  like, Hey, we know that lots of teachers and lots of copy editors, Oh, hi copy editors.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.540]  We know that you like editing things by hand.
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.700]  We know that you don't necessarily want to double tap to highlight a word or phrase and
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.960]  then type out a long comment.
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.940]  You want to use the shorthand that you've been using for years.
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:20.860]  So here's a way for you to use shorthand and have it work the same way that a comments
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:22.060]  section works.
[01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:24.800]  It's like, it's such a brilliant little feature.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:29.820]  They don't technically have to enter like make, but they made.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.820]  Yeah.
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:37.820]  Um, so what is, have you figured out the full story on ebook software now?
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:43.220]  Like so, all right, what is going on?
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220]  Okay.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.660]  All right.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:52.180]  So baseline, I guess like the, the history lesson here is when Apple first got into eBooks,
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:58.900]  they got into eBooks and kind of a haphazard way through pages and this was like 20, 2010,
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.540]  2011.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:05.520]  I want to say like early, early, early, uh, they're like, Hey, people want to make eBooks
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.500]  in a way that's not just tearing their hair out through InDesign or hand coating it themselves.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:17.300]  So let's make a super rudimentary export option in pages.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300]  And that was awful.
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.220]  I mean, it was great in that you could make an ebook without using InDesign, but it was
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:28.900]  also awful because you had no idea what kept as styling and what disappeared because Apple
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:32.540]  didn't actually have that like nice little compatibility window that it has now where
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.540]  it's like, this didn't export properly.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:39.540]  So you were, it was a guessing game for a long time being like, does this work in an
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.540]  ebook?
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.540]  Does this work in an ebook?
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540]  No?
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.540]  Okay.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.340]  Uh, so after about a couple of years of that, Apple's like, Hey, maybe we should make a
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:54.060]  better tool that doesn't quite suck as much, uh, especially because, um, with, you know,
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:57.880]  the iBook store and everything, we want to give people the opportunity to make these
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.180]  really beautiful, you know, nice looking books because eBooks in general suck.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.180]  They suck to look at.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.420]  They're a great idea, but they just don't look pretty.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:14.460]  So Apple took what was a burgeoning format in terms of EPUB 3, um, but it was still very
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.460]  early.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.020]  It was like early days of HTML5 when it was in beta, right?
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.160]  Where just like half of the things didn't work and they didn't work properly across
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.680]  all platforms.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.120]  So Apple said, you know, screw this, we're going to wrap EPUB 3 in our own custom dot
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.580]  iBooks format, which is essentially the EPUB 3 format with some extra CSS, like some custom
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.380]  CSS, uh, not unlike WebKit basically.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.740]  And they're like, here, we've made you a program called iBooks author that can, that can make
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740]  these books.
[01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:50.560]  Uh, but the catch is it can only make these dot iBooks custom, you know, proprietary books
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:55.320]  that can only be read on the app store or on the iBook store because the other, the
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.140]  other, uh, competing bookstores will not know what the heck to do with this.
[01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:04.360]  Uh, so that's, so that's kind of been their book strategy for a while is, oh, if you want
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.900]  to build like a simple book, you can do it in pages, but if you want to do anything with
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:14.760]  graphics or anything with stylization or fonts and to have smart, smart, like support for
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.740]  rotation so that if it's on an iPad and you're holding it in landscape, you get a different
[01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:21.700]  layout than if you're holding it in portrait.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.700]  Exactly.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:26.900]  The difference between a fixed format and a reflowable book, uh, which reflowable you
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.460]  can change the text size.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:33.360]  Uh, so, you know, they've had this for a few years, but the, the big problem of course
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:39.300]  is that almost as soon as they made it, EPUB 3 started getting decent.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:45.960]  So about, I'd say about a year after iBooks author came out, EPUB 3 started implementing
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:51.600]  all of these, these fixes and changes that kind of made the iBooks format look really
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:57.780]  janky and, and be like, well, you could do it, you could do video embed, you know, the
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:01.540]  way that the iBook store does, or the iBooks format does it, or you can do video embed
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:05.900]  the way that the EPUB 3 store or the EPUB 3 format does it.
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:11.020]  And I think the iWork team was in a bit of a pickle because they're like, well, we have
[01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:16.940]  EPUB 3 support for, in pages, but the pages implementation right now is non-existent other
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:20.060]  than like rudimentary text.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.820]  We could build off of that, but we also have this custom book application that we just
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:29.900]  spent a lot of time putting effort into, uh, so we're not really sure what to do.
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:37.320]  And I think the, the answer here became, well, we've got this custom book format, um, and
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.980]  it's going to be around a little bit longer because we can't do everything that we want
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:47.340]  to do in pages with EPUB 3, uh, but we're going to put all of our mental might behind
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.760]  pages and EPUB 3 because we've already built it for iOS and we've already built it for
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:53.760]  the web.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:59.020]  So really for us to expand upon it, all we have to do is put in more tools and hook these
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.180]  things up.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:05.380]  Whereas for iBooks author, it would be like, it would be a whole lot more work for us to
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.940]  not only port it over to iOS, but if we're still porting it over to iOS with the dot
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.300]  iBooks format, then we're still working on this like super janky format.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:19.620]  So the, the TLDR of the situation is that iBooks author still exists.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.040]  It's not being discontinued.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.260]  It's not being, you know, it's not disappearing.
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:27.260]  Uh, but I don't think it will exist for much longer.
[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:31.620]  I think it will probably stick around for another year or so and maybe get some security
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:37.820]  updates, but by and large, it looks like Apple's kind of tying their, tying their horse to
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:43.060]  pages as saying, Hey, you know, like this is a really, we're going to make this the
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.020]  best word processing app that we possibly can on the Mac.
[01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:50.320]  Um, and we basically want it that no matter what document that you're creating, you can
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.980]  export whatever you want, whether that's a book and you want it to make it look like
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:57.620]  a book, whether you want to export it as a PDF, whether you want to export it as a poster
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:02.940]  and print it like we just want to give you one app to do all of these things.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:08.660]  Um, and so that's, yeah, I, I, I thought after I remember asking you after the event, like
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.780]  what the heck was going on with iBooks author, I thought the fact that they didn't even mention
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.780]  it.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.140]  I expected that by the time the event was over, the iBooks author wasn't even in the
[01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.140]  app store anymore.
[01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.140]  Nope.
[01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:20.460]  Like, so it is, that's not true.
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.460]  It is still there.
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:25.260]  I'm looking at the page in the app store right now, but the fact that they never even mentioned
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:31.260]  it was, you know, about as proof positive as you're going to get that, that, that their
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:38.980]  answer to how do you make custom books, you know, for, you know, how do you make a book
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:39.980]  is use pages.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.980]  Yeah.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.380]  Well, and I mean, there's, there's good reason for it.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.540]  Like the pages, I haven't played with it a whole lot, but the pages, uh, the new pages
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:52.180]  stuff for books is pretty like pretty thorough for the basics.
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:57.660]  It's pretty thorough for text, for galleries, for video, uh, where it gets a little bit
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:02.720]  questionable and which by questionable, I mean, not possible is when you get into iBooks
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.780]  authors more like niche features, like the popovers that were made or like the HTML five
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.380]  widgets pages doesn't support those yet.
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.800]  And I don't know if they will.
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.780]  Like I'd like to believe that they're going to add glossaries and like figure numbers
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:20.920]  and things like that to pages because it seems like a thing that would be pretty easy to
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.800]  add in a roadmap.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.660]  But some of the more niche like iBooks author features, there's a question on whether or
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:30.620]  not it makes sense for them to, to add that.
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:33.820]  And that's why that still exists.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:39.180]  The file format story then is that if you use iBooks author, you're still making dot
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.180]  iBooks books.
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.180]  Yes.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:46.860]  But if you use pages, the new version of pages and export, you're going to export EPUB three.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860]  Yeah.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.900]  So you're going to make, you're going to make a book that's able to be read, whether it's
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:56.220]  fixed format or flowable, it can be read on an iBook or on a, on iBooks, it can be theoretically
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.220]  read on a Kindle.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.960]  It can be theoretically read on another ebook reader.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.200]  Like that's the open format.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.300]  So that does sound better.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.860]  And I don't think that they created the, I think you're right.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:15.820]  I think, you know, I don't think they created the iBooks dot iBooks format just out of proprietary
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.940]  file format lock-in.
[01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.940]  Yay.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:24.900]  I really think it was because they wanted to enable interactivity and an attractiveness,
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:29.020]  for lack of a better word, that EPUB wasn't up to at that point.
[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:33.140]  And sometimes, you know, it's a very Apple like thing to do is just, we're not going
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:36.580]  to sit around and wait for the standards group to take years over this.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:40.420]  We're just going to go do it, you know, and you can catch up.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.940]  We're just going to make a thing.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.300]  You know, but I think in general though, this it's a better, the idea of a sort of, well,
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:54.100]  not even sort of a real standard format being the de facto, here's the file format you pass
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.780]  around is a better situation.
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:59.720]  Yeah, I agree a hundred percent.
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:04.340]  And I say that as somebody who has made terrible books and pages in the 2011 days and also
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:09.380]  made books in iBooks author and in InDesign, like I've used pretty much all of the things
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.260]  that you can do.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:17.500]  And for me, ultimately, I want something that's going to, that's going to be easy to edit
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.140]  and that's going to look nice when I export it.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:26.440]  And pages, especially with the drawing, like the, the addition of the drawing features
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:29.980]  is a small, like may seem like a small thing, but it's really going to allow you to kind
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:36.300]  of personalize fixed format books in a way that I don't think you really could before
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.780]  because of the way that images overlap and everything else.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:44.660]  And I think it allows just, just for a lot more design in general that was then was previously
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:46.780]  available in pages.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:50.420]  And to, you know, I don't even mind, I don't mind designing fixed format books if they're
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:54.700]  going to look beautiful and the text size is going to be, you know, people can zoom
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:57.860]  if they want to, if they want to read it like that.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:02.260]  But by and large, you just make the text big enough so that it's easy to see for the majority
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.260]  of the population.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:09.380]  And then you put in the accessibility features for people who want voiceover.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.380]  There's an item here in the show notes.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:14.700]  I don't know what this is in reference to you say keynotes, hidden animation program.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.900]  What is, what is, what is this?
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:16.900]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:17.900]  Okay.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.860]  So there's a, there's a feature in keynote that's been around for a while called magic
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:28.540]  move, which is essentially just, you know, you take object A and you key frame it and
[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:34.060]  you say, okay, object A is going to go to object B and then you press play and it moves
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:38.620]  to object B either in a straight line or a squiggle or, you know, however you'd like
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:39.620]  it.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.160]  So there's, there's that, that's like rudimentary animation.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.160]  It's literally just taking a static object from here and then moving it to there.
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:53.420]  But what's really cool in addition to magic move is that keynote has added an auto draw,
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:58.400]  like kind of like procreates a recreation of your drawing.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:05.660]  But keynote has added this inside the keynote program so that if you draw anything in keynote
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:11.680]  and then you animate it, it will actually like re like auto draw basically what you've
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.060]  just all of the strokes that you've just done.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.180]  And it's not true animation, obviously.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:20.580]  It's not, you know, you're not going frame by frame by frame.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:26.480]  But it does add a lot of personality to slides, especially slides that have drawings in them.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.620]  So if you want to like, you know, you can draw a sunscape, for instance, and then have
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:35.380]  it turn to rain by adding more clouds and erasing certain, certain things.
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:40.060]  And it's, I don't know, I think, as somebody who's tried all of the animation programs
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:45.360]  on the store and finds them all tremendously lacking, keynote's not going to replace an
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.140]  actual Mac animation program.
[01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:52.420]  But I think it will give a lot of kids who are interested in animation and even adults
[01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:57.860]  who are interested in animation, really easy tools to play around and start learning about
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:03.960]  things like keyframes and things like like match moves, and I don't know, I, I'm really
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960]  excited about it.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.620]  I think it's really cool.
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:12.500]  People use keynotes, one of those apps that people use in very different ways, right?
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.500]  Like I know some I know people who effectively sort of use it as an outliner, like just not
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.380]  like they're making a presentation for somebody else.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:23.300]  But if they're just sort of working on a big project, and they want to get their ideas
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:27.880]  into an outline format, they use keynote, and then the, you know, the left side sidebar,
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.540]  you know, you think about it, it's a outline, and they like it as an outliner.
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.680]  And it's like, well, why don't you use like omni outliner or something?
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.300]  And I got I like this, because they're used to it.
[01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:43.220]  And one of the other weird uses of keynote or I would like unexpected would be like UI
[01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.180]  designers who use it for I think, and it's exactly what you're talking about for the
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:51.700]  animation features, where if you want to, if you want to show, you know, like, you're
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:57.340]  going from this screen, and you if you tap here, it will go to here, but you want there
[01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:03.040]  to be, you know, an animated transition keynote, you know, there's people who it's obviously
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:09.020]  not like the main point of the app, but it's, you know, surprisingly often used for like,
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:16.860]  locking up rudimentary user interfaces with transitions, like that's, I think that's the
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.840]  key to its appeal in that area is that soap modern apps, you just don't expect that when
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.860]  you tap something, and you're going to a new screen that the new screen just pops into
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.500]  place, you expect some sort of animated transition.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:34.420]  And it's, you know, yeah, screenshots alone are hard to hard to express that with.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:41.900]  Yeah, I can see it also you I mean, I could see this very easily working in tandem with
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:45.900]  other apps to become like a like a storyboarding app almost.
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.180]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:48.940]  Yeah, I think that's exactly it.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.940]  Yeah.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:53.260]  All right, not too many items left on the agenda here.
[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:58.300]  But one of them is this weird, not weird, but interesting new product from Logitech
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:29:59.300]  the crayon.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.300]  Right.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:01.300]  So yeah, Apple.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.300]  How much does Apple pencil costs?
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.300]  Was it 129?
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:10.260]  No, Apple pencil is 9999 in the US 129 in Canada and 89 for education customers.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.260]  All right.
[01:30:11.260 --> 01:30:19.700]  Well, crayon is a new product from Logitech and but it's like, and again, it's hard to
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:21.060]  get a straight answer from Apple.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:24.860]  It's they were admitted that they worked with Logitech on this, but like just to what degree
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:27.680]  it's so it's it's a great answer.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.680]  It's a pencil.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680]  It's an Apple pencil.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:34.420]  Yeah, it uses Apple pencil tech, but it's not pressure sensitive.
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.420]  Correct.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.380]  So that's the one thing that the real Apple pencil has that the crayon doesn't.
[01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:44.260]  And the other difference and I thought this was really interesting is that it doesn't
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:48.340]  have to be paired with the iPad.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:57.380]  So a classroom with 10 iPads and 10 of these Logitech crayons, a kid can come up and grab
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.940]  any crayon and any iPad and it'll just work.
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.140]  Yep, exactly.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:08.780]  But then, you know, I guess it's a downside, but the weird thing about it is that they're
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.340]  only selling it to the education market and it's $49 not $99.
[01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.100]  So it's half the price of the Apple pencil, but they're only selling it to education right
[01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:18.100]  now.
[01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:23.180]  And then I again, I asked, all right, it's education only right now.
[01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:26.620]  Are there any plans for it to be sold to consumers?
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:30.740]  And the answer was it's education only for now, or Logitech has announced that it's education
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:31.740]  only.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:41.540]  I got a we'll see which, which to me, which to me indicates that, well, especially given
[01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:47.460]  how many Logitech accessories I've covered in the past, Logitech has a little bit of
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.460]  problem, not problem per se, but like they they scale up a little bit more slowly than
[01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.460]  Apple.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.640]  Let's I'll put that put it that way.
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:59.700]  So I imagine what will happen, especially the crayons not going to be available until
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:00.700]  summer.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:01.700]  Right.
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:06.280]  So I imagine the crayon like they're going to start it in the education market A to see
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.040]  how much of a demand there is and B to see how much of a demand there is in the consumer
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:16.940]  space to and kind of see, oh, are there a million people asking for the crayon?
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:20.520]  Well, maybe we can release this in the mainstream.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:26.580]  But I say that and I look at Logitech's other education only bit for the low cost iPad,
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.300]  which is the rugged case.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:33.060]  And the rugged case uses the lightning port in a very similar way that the smart connector
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:34.060]  is used.
[01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:35.060]  Right.
[01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:39.300]  The case, you know, it's designed to be a very rugged, like its name, a rugged case
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.780]  to prevent your iPad from breaking if it drops.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:45.760]  But it also has this heavy duty Logitech keyboard attached to it.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.180]  But the case itself snaps into your iPhone's lightning port.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.160]  And then there's like a little mini smart connector at the bottom of this case that
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.300]  snaps into the Logitech keyboard next to it.
[01:32:57.300 --> 01:33:04.480]  So so they've essentially also made a smart connector keyboard for the low cost iPad without
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.620]  actually needing a smart connector.
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.660]  So that same principle with the crayon, you know, they don't have to worry about pairing
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:15.480]  Bluetooth, pairing Bluetooth keyboards or charging Bluetooth keyboards.
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:18.780]  It's just plugging things in with lightning.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:26.900]  So that's the one of the little like asterisks of this event is, you know, and we've mentioned
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:31.180]  it several times already, but you know, the cost of these things is a big deal to schools
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:36.020]  because schools for whatever, you know, we could do a whole show about how weird and
[01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:40.260]  sick it is that the richest country in the world has underfunded schools.
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:45.460]  But that's the world we live in is our schools are terribly underfunded and teachers are
[01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:48.500]  having to do things like buy their own paper and pencils and stuff.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.580]  So a $300 iPad is a significant expense.
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:56.900]  But the asterisk here is that for a lot of these schools, the Logitech rugged case is
[01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.620]  not really an option.
[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.620]  It's mandatory.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:05.380]  You know, like they kind of have to, you know, like, so it's not really a 299 iPad.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:13.060]  It's it's a 299 iPad plus a rugged combo case, which I think is $100 or 100 hundred bucks.
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:17.180]  Yeah, it's I think it's 100 bucks and then it's sold in packs of 10 so you can't even
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.900]  get it individually.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.900]  Yeah.
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:27.900]  So you know, you know, and it's it's this Apple being Apple where Apple is not going
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:33.380]  to make a case that's so ugly, I mean, and it's ugly because it is so literally rugged.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.620]  It's well named.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:38.640]  But schools aren't going to buy these iPads and give them to the kids without putting
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:39.980]  them in a rugged case.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.340]  Yeah, no question.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:48.460]  Did you know this that one of the reasons that it uses the lightning cable is?
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.740]  You probably knew this but maybe you didn't a couple people I talked to at the event had
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:57.200]  no idea but there's a bunch of standardized tests that kids can take on computers now
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.700]  you don't like they don't have to do them all on paper with your number two pencil.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:11.020]  You can take standardized tests on a computer but there's the testing apps mandate that
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:16.660]  you can't have any wireless connectivity while the test is being taken for obvious reasons.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:20.860]  So you can't use Wi Fi but you can't that the the the thing that kills a lot of the
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:24.180]  products that might other schools might otherwise you'd use for a keyboard is you can't use
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:30.660]  Bluetooth and the app that the kid is in to take the test literally won't run if Bluetooth
[01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.820]  is enabled on the device for you know, anti cheating purposes.
[01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:42.660]  So it has to there has to be like an electrical wired connection from the key press through
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.900]  to the iPad and that means the only you know, for an iPad that doesn't have a smart connector
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:48.860]  it would have to be through the lightning port.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:49.860]  That is fascinating.
[01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:53.380]  I did not know that but it makes a lot of sense.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:56.300]  But that's the you know, but they have to and I think they have to have a keyboard to
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.980]  like you can't take these tests without a hardware keyboard has to be you know, there's
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:03.740]  like a set of specifications for it.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.580]  And I thought that was pretty interesting.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:09.920]  But it's it's an essential combination and it's just kind of interesting to see Apple
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.140]  pairing with, you know, a company like Logitech to do this, like as an essential component
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:21.500]  of using this in a school, you've pretty much got to go to Logitech to get the case.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:24.680]  Yeah, there really isn't.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.680]  There aren't alternatives, not good ones, at least, I guess you can buy adapters for
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.500]  everybody and then plug in a USB keyboard.
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:34.500]  I guess.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:35.500]  All right.
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.500]  Right.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:37.500]  I don't even know.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:38.500]  I don't know.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.620]  It's it you know, it's one of those just a bunch of rules and I could see why they would
[01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:46.000]  have a bunch of rules but it just seems like it would be a pain in the ass to have to deal
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  with it.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.780]  All right, last but not least, is the one thing that they did not announce at this event
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:55.640]  that I kind of thought that they would, even though it doesn't fit with an education theme
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.080]  is where the hell is the airpower charging pad?
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.740]  Like we're rocking spring.
[01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:02.740]  Did they say spring?
[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.440]  Did they say March?
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.220]  I think they said 2018.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:09.820]  They said early next year or something.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:13.860]  Something has gone terribly wrong with this product because it was originally meant, it's
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:24.340]  clear that it was originally meant to debut alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 10.
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:30.640]  So plan B on Apple's wireless charging story was obviously the fallback to the recommended
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:36.140]  products they have from Mophie and Belkin and the fact that it, you know, they work
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:42.180]  with any standard Qi charger.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:48.100]  But plan A was obviously to have the Apple super, you know, even better than the cheap
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:51.900]  standard charging pad ready to go in September.
[01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:55.700]  And now here we are at the end of March and they still don't have it out.
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:00.740]  And you know, who knows, maybe they will have another event between now and WWDC.
[01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.280]  No, I don't see it.
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:03.280]  I see it.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.280]  April's maybe.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.100]  I don't, I don't think so either.
[01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:10.260]  But I don't think it's, I don't think it's, I don't think it's impossible.
[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.500]  Like April, they've had events in April before.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.940]  But I don't think it's likely.
[01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:19.700]  But that means if they don't have another event, that the earliest it'll come out would
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.020]  be WWDC.
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:22.780]  And that's, it's like nine months late.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:25.360]  No, I just think they'll, I think they'll press release it.
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:29.900]  I think they'll do it the way they did the AirPods, where the AirPods just suddenly appear.
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.100]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.060]  I guess it doesn't have to wait for an event.
[01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.860]  Yeah, I guess you're right.
[01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.900]  Because they've already announced, they've already announced it.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.620]  They've already previewed it on, you know, on an event floor.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.780]  I don't think they need an event to announce it.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.780]  But I agree.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:46.300]  I'm kind of shocked that it hasn't shipped yet.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.580]  Yeah, something I would love to hear the backstory on it.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:53.960]  But something has obviously gone terribly wrong on this where it not only didn't ship
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.020]  on time in September, it's now three months into 2018.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.320]  And it's still like, nowhere to be seen.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:06.820]  We can file it alongside iMessages for iCloud and AirPower or AirPlay two.
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:07.820]  Yeah.
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:08.820]  All right.
[01:39:08.820 --> 01:39:12.540]  Well, the last last, the one last thing I want to talk about is is the current state
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:20.060]  of the iPad lineup seems a little out of whack because the iPad Pro models are based on the
[01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:26.860]  same A10 architecture as the new 329 iPad.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:31.580]  And presumably there will be A11 or maybe they'll call it the A11X, you know, as they
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:35.740]  have in the past where the iPad gets a slightly different system on a chip than the current
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:41.140]  generation iPhones.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.980]  Presumably they will, there will be new iPad Pros this year.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.980]  But if so, when?
[01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:50.260]  It's out of DC.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.260]  That's my thought.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.920]  It makes more sense than holding another event, I think.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:40:01.380]  But it right now, until they do, it's left the current iPad lineup in a weird state.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:03.980]  Like I wouldn't recommend an iPad Pro at this point.
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:08.540]  I mean, I wait, I would, I would not if you can wait for sure.
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:12.700]  But I think it's the same state that the Macs are in kind of, you know, where it's like,
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.820]  we've seen this before, back when the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro line were kind of straddling
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.980]  similar spheres, the MacBook Air would get updated and then the MacBook Pro would get
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:25.740]  updated like a month or two later because we were waiting for like Ivy Bridge or whatever
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:29.940]  nonsense Intel was delaying that quarter.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:35.580]  But I will say like the Pros, if you absolutely have to buy a Pro today, the 10.5 still is
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:42.040]  like, at least stats and benchmark wise, like the A10X and A10 are practically two different
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.460]  chips despite technically sharing the same architecture.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:49.740]  Like it's, it's something like twice as fast and single and multi core.
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:53.100]  And then you've also got the four gigs of RAM versus two gigs of RAM, which plays a
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.100]  big deal.
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.980]  Like, there's a big difference played into that.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:41:03.900]  So it's like, it's the the 2018 iPad, you know, it outweighs the the last year's 2017
[01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:08.500]  and it outweighs the original 9.7 and 12.9 iPad Pro.
[01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:14.460]  But like on on an overall scale, like iPads Pro are still still in a pretty good spot.
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.420]  But I tend to agree with you.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:20.940]  Like I wouldn't, I'm not going to actively say go buy an iPad Pro.
[01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:24.460]  Because I do think that we're going to see new ones in in June.
[01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:32.080]  Yeah, and my guess would be it because one of the things that's kind of pretty predictable
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:35.140]  about Apple, like the Mac schedule is kind of hard to predict.
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.140]  Right?
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:40.940]  Like, all of a sudden, yeah, Intel's chip.
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.380]  Maybe we'll go seven years without updating the Mac Pro.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:44.380]  Who knows?
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:48.020]  You know, and other times that would never happen.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:52.700]  Other times, it's like nine months after a new MacBook Pro ships, there's a speed bump
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:53.700]  update.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:56.880]  And because you know, like you said, like Intel comes out with a new thing, Apple switches
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.100]  to the new thing.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:05.100]  But like the Intel chip lineup, like I've, I've lost my, my will to understand it.
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.420]  I don't care.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.980]  It's so weird.
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.860]  Yeah, I just don't care.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:14.300]  I cannot get into a new core seven or i7, whatever.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:15.300]  I don't care.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:16.300]  I don't.
[01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.300]  It doesn't.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:20.780]  It's not just too, too complex, too, too confusing to me.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:25.320]  Whereas Apple's internal chip update is very easy to predict.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.540]  Like a new iPhone comes out in September, and they call it the a whatever the last number
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:31.600]  was plus one.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:38.860]  And eventually, that chip makes it into the iPad, sometimes around March, sometimes, you
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.700]  know, I guess a little later.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:45.700]  But it'll, you know, you can kind of count on there being an annual update to the iPad
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:53.620]  that catches up to the current top of the top of the line iPhone a series chip.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.320]  I don't know that that alone is a reason not to buy an iPad Pro right now, if you really
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:07.060]  want one, but to me, it's the fact that the iPhone 10 was this sort of true, like 2.0
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.660]  rethinking of the way iOS works.
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:14.180]  And my guess is that the next iPad Pro will come with face ID.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:20.940]  And Oh, yeah, in other interaction on screen that mimics the iPhone 10, where you go to
[01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:28.220]  the top for, you know, because I that's I don't use an iPad enough to I honest, I have
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:29.220]  one and I use it sometimes.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:34.060]  But at this point, the way that it doesn't work, like my iPhone 10 makes me crazy, because
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:36.160]  I'm swiping at the wrong place for everything.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:40.580]  And I just there's no way that I can keep both of them in mind, like, you know, every
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:44.700]  podcast on the earth is, you know, mentioned, like, you know, you get it, you switch to
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.160]  an iPhone 10.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.460]  And at first, you're lost, but seriously, it doesn't even take a whole week, just give
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:50.460]  it a few days.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:52.820]  And all of a sudden, you know, it's all natural.
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:57.540]  And you get the new multitasking from switching up and you get used to going to the top right
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:01.520]  for, control center, etc, etc.
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.620]  But I can't.
[01:44:02.620 --> 01:44:07.060]  Now when I use an iPad, I my finger goes to the wrong spot for everything.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:11.500]  And I'm like, I forgot how to multitask the other day, I was like, how do we?
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:12.500]  How the hell do I switch apps?
[01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:15.540]  I was like, Oh, shit, you have to double you have to double click the button.
[01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:21.940]  No, no, use the multitasking gestures.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.380]  It's just weird, though, right?
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:24.660]  It's like this device.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:26.460]  It's exactly the same.
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:27.700]  This is the funny thing to me.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:28.700]  No, I agree with you.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.700]  I agree with you.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.320]  And that it's frustrating.
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.880]  Because like, for instance, control center is on the bottom instead of the top.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.220]  But like the swipe gestures, the swipe gestures were all pioneered on the iPad before before
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.220]  the iPhone 10.
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:42.220]  I'll give you the swipe gestures.
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.220]  But like control center, it makes me crazy.
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.220]  Yeah.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.220]  Right.
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.140]  I agree with you there.
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:49.140]  That's that.
[01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:52.700]  And and, honestly, the lack of face ID is just the most mad.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.580]  I'm like, why, why am I having to do this ridiculous fingerprint thing here?
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:44:57.580]  This is ridiculous.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:03.300]  Like, this device should just, you know.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:04.580]  So I don't know, that would be my thing.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.580]  But I think you're right.
[01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:08.020]  I think I would guess WWDC.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.020]  I don't know.
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:15.420]  Yeah, I'm, I'm leaning towards WWDC, especially the 10.5 came out last year, and the update
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:16.940]  to the 12.9.
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:21.000]  So theoretically, we are we are on that schedule, right?
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.740]  It will be it will have been a year since the newest iPad Pro has been released when
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:27.560]  we hit WWDC.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.060]  So it would make sense to add that in there again.
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:35.460]  And also, I look at it from a if like, for instance, if marzipan really gets released
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:40.060]  this this summer, or it gets, you know, put into dev beta for release in the next version
[01:45:40.060 --> 01:45:46.780]  of Mac OS and iOS, like a really supercharged iPad Pro that kind of bridges the gap there
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:50.020]  would, I think, be a really smart move.
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:51.020]  Yeah.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:53.500]  Yeah, I could see that.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:57.500]  Anything else you want to talk about for this event for education for what we expect in
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:58.500]  the next few weeks?
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:45:59.500]  I think we covered it all.
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:03.620]  This is yeah, I think I mean, I'm curious to see when our power is going to come out.
[01:46:03.620 --> 01:46:07.660]  The only other thing that I had on my list, which doesn't really relate to the event was
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:13.260]  just you know, Tim Cook talked to Kara Swisher and the Recode folks about Facebook and privacy,
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:15.460]  which was a really interesting interview.
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.500]  I'm really curious to see the full thing.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:21.620]  I'm kind of sad that I couldn't stick around to see it in person in Chicago.
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:23.460]  Yeah, I couldn't either.
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.460]  Yeah.
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:28.820]  And it's like, I don't know, I guess they kind of kept it secret.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.860]  I mean, I only found out about it like a day before.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:32.860]  Yeah.
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:33.860]  Yeah.
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:34.860]  It was like, yes.
[01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:38.540]  Yeah, I think I probably I almost certainly would have stayed one more day just to do
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:39.700]  I would have stayed for that.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.700]  What the heck?
[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:41.700]  I love Chicago.
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:42.700]  Chicago is beautiful town.
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.740]  But I was like, I've already got my flight book.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.740]  Yeah.
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.340]  It was too late to move it.
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:49.340]  So exactly.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:58.500]  So there's there was that there was Apple's sort of re envisioning of their privacy controls
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.860]  to have the website so that you can download all of the information from Apple services
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:08.280]  and delete or deactivate your account more easily, which is that's coming in May, I think
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:13.060]  and that that is pretty cool, if only because it's been super frustrating to try and delete
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:14.500]  and manage an Apple ID.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.220]  So I'm hoping that will be a little bit easier.
[01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:24.820]  And then there's the there's 10 point or 11.3 came out without without AirPlay two, which
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.100]  I'm not surprised about.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.100]  But
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.100]  it's another one.
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:31.380]  It's like they can't win any product with the name.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.380]  It's like,
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:36.220]  networking, apparently, networking is really hard, who knew?
[01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:40.980]  But the the interesting thing of 11.3 and there are like a lot of little fun things
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:41.980]  in there.
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:48.860]  And I really love Apple has a new indicator anytime they're going to ask for your information,
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:52.920]  and a new kind of screen that pops up and an icon that shows up anytime that they're
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:56.480]  going to ask for anything that's potentially privacy related.
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:02.820]  And again, in the age of like, all of the Facebook stuff, I find that really soothing,
[01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:07.260]  in a way just to be like, Hey, here are these two little buddies in circled in blue, this
[01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:10.100]  is just to let you know that we might be requesting your personal data.
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:14.260]  So maybe you should look a little bit harder at this screen, rather than, you know, just
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:16.180]  gloss over it and press accept.
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:22.300]  Yeah, it's funny, I feel like Facebook has been I can't talk about it extensively.
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:25.060]  Yeah, we'll go for another few hours.
[01:48:25.060 --> 01:48:30.660]  I've long suspected that Facebook has been running out of rope on this.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:37.620]  And that for years, Facebook has had an institutional almost complete disregard of our lack of respect
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:43.460]  for their users privacy, they'll track anything and everything that they can.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.660]  And they've never really been called out on it.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.800]  I mean, there's obviously some people who've said, you know, forever, like, I'm not comfortable
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.860]  with this, you know, what they do.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:58.720]  But the, you know, the literally billions of people who use their product.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.100]  And there's very few people, you know, companies in the world that can measure their user base
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.100]  in billions, billions, yeah.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:12.620]  And, you know, obviously, just didn't really seem to care and only cared about the utility
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:17.320]  of Yes, this is a nice, this is a fun way to stay in touch with family and share photos
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:22.420]  and what, you know, all right, you know, yada yada yada privacy, but I feel like it's catching
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:27.980]  up to them now, like with the whole Cambridge Analytica story about the way that this information
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.680]  could be abused, people are like, what?
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.500]  And then there was a thing where it's like this, the Facebook version of you can download
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:42.540]  all your Facebook data and people are doing it and like apparently on Android, like, Facebook
[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:46.020]  logs everything you do with your phone.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.340]  So it's like the one guy was like, it's got a list of every phone call I've made for like
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:50.340]  the last two years.
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:51.940]  What the hell is this doing on Facebook?
[01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:54.080]  This is so bizarre, right?
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.260]  And people, you know, people see find out about stuff like that.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:02.100]  And then they're like, what is wrong with, you know, this company?
[01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:07.340]  And it's like, you know, it's democracy at work, and it works, you know, too slowly.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:11.260]  It's like the old, what's the old adage that democracy is the worst system of government
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.260]  other than all the other systems?
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:14.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:18.820]  But it's like lawmakers are catching on to it too, right?
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:22.260]  And they're like, hey, you know, and they're like, they're slowly looking at Facebook.
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:26.620]  And I think Facebook is at that moment where they've kind of got like their collective
[01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:33.500]  finger in their shirt, collar, and a cookie jar kind of shoes.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.500]  Right.
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.820]  Yeah, they're they're not in a great place.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:40.140]  And that's like I said, I like I really like Apple's approach to that.
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:43.120]  I mean, I've liked Apple's approach to privacy for a long time now.
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:49.580]  But I really appreciate again, if there's a big honkin blue icon on any request for
[01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:54.140]  privacy, it allows me to really pay attention to that dialogue as opposed to Facebook's
[01:50:54.140 --> 01:51:03.020]  like, can we have your contacts press here to not not give us your contacts?
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:10.820]  I will say this, I'm glad I remembered this, but just as a to add a everything regarding
[01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:15.820]  Apple in this issue is not great.
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:22.020]  I think it's under remarked upon Apple's I was gonna say complicit in this, but that
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:28.400]  sounds like a pretty scathing word, but I'll go with a couple of complicit in Facebook's
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:35.380]  collection of information from iOS users by having Facebook built into the OS for I think
[01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:37.720]  it was around five years.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:44.080]  Like they removed it in iOS 10, I believe, but from like somewhere around, and I could
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.260]  be getting a version number wrong, but somewhere around iOS four or five through iOS nine,
[01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:52.420]  Facebook and Twitter were built into the Settings app.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:57.500]  And you could, you know, authenticate with Facebook, and then that would enable app developers
[01:51:57.500 --> 01:52:00.800]  to skip having their own thing.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:06.700]  So if your game wanted to save data and do something in a way that like Game Center wasn't
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:10.780]  set up to do, you could do it through Facebook, and you wouldn't have to write your own Facebook
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:14.180]  code, you could just call into the system.
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:19.220]  Facebook collected a lot of information about a lot of iOS users through all of the app
[01:52:19.220 --> 01:52:24.200]  data that they collected by having that feature built in.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.820]  And I think it's pretty clear that Apple got rid of that feature, not because it wasn't
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:34.740]  being used, but because they realized it was a mistake strategically and ran counter to
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:39.380]  their their beliefs on privacy.
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:41.960]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:47.180]  I think, as I think if they had it to do all over again, Apple wouldn't do it.
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:51.100]  If they had it to do all over again, they never would have built it in.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.420]  Maybe they would have spent more time on Game Center, which still is half broken.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:59.140]  Oh, hey, hey, did you know as of 11.3 you can delete friends individually now so you
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:03.460]  don't have to delete them all in one go, but you still can't add friends.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:06.220]  You still can't add new people.
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:08.580]  I haven't opened the Game Center app in a long time.
[01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:11.580]  Well, that's because it doesn't exist anymore, John.
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:12.580]  The app is gone.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.420]  The app has been gone for two years.
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:17.820]  Well, that would explain why.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:18.820]  How do you manage it then?
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.000]  No, that's the point.
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.700]  For the last two years, since they've deleted the app, you can't manage it.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:29.120]  So for a while, your only option was just delete all friends or your existing ones.
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:33.600]  So I have I literally I have the Game Center friends that I had when I left Macworld.
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:38.360]  So it's basically all of my Macworld colleagues and like three of my friends, which is really
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.140]  obnoxious if I want to like actually compete with people like when I when I was playing
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:49.300]  Alto's Odyssey, it was literally it was like me, Jason, Snell, Dan, Frakes and Panzer,
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:54.220]  I think is on my friends list right now.
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:59.140]  It's you know, but that's the game thing is a real example where Apple's if for years
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.140]  there, you know, be like, hey, how do I do this in game?
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:06.340]  I want my game to like sync this data between like the iPad and the iPhone version.
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:09.780]  And, you know, it was like I can't actually do that in Game Center.
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:11.300]  So we recommend you use Facebook.
[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:15.420]  And if you, you know, do, you know, trust the system level Facebook thing, you could,
[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.740]  you know, store the data.
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:20.860]  Like Apple was recommending it and games was were a big reason for it.
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:25.060]  I mean, did Facebook really collect a lot of interesting information from people who
[01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:27.940]  were playing games where they save their data through Facebook?
[01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:28.940]  I don't know.
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:32.500]  Let's not ask that question because you're going to be depressed.
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:33.500]  Right.
[01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.220]  So yeah, don't be surprised at what they could get out of it.
[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.220]  Right.
[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.220]  Exactly.
[01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.200]  Probably, you know, like location data, there's all sorts of stuff they could have gotten.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.200]  So yuck.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.200]  Yeah.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:47.200]  But so, you know, I don't think it's a huge deal.
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.580]  I feel like Apple is overall on the right side, has been on the right side of the privacy
[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:57.220]  story from, you know, early way before most people saw it as a big issue.
[01:54:57.220 --> 01:54:58.380]  But I don't think the record is perfect.
[01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:04.380]  I think that that integration that they had for years was was the single worst thing Apple's
[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:08.100]  done privacy wise in my memory.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:12.220]  Anyway, thanks for being here.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:18.620]  Everybody can find your writing, your good work at iMore.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:24.660]  And on Twitter, you are, I don't remember your username, what's your username?
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:25.660]  It's Saturn.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:26.660]  S-E-T-T-E-R-N.
[01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:28.740]  It's a nonsense word.
[01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:32.500]  So S-E-T-T-E-R-N on Twitter.
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:38.180]  You can see how well prepared I am for the show.
