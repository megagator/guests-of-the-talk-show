[00:00.000 --> 00:05.200]  There might be some listeners out there who think perhaps this podcast has too much baseball content
[00:05.200 --> 00:09.200]  and should focus more on Apple. Now I have bad news for those people.
[00:10.560 --> 00:13.920]  Sorry, non-sports fans. It's gotta be sports.
[00:14.880 --> 00:21.200]  But I do think there are numerous, talking about the strategy and why Apple's even getting into,
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.600]  you know, what we're alluding to here for anybody who's been under a rock is Friday night baseball,
[00:25.600 --> 00:32.480]  which I guess is a new thing, right? It's not like Apple is taking over Friday night baseball from
[00:33.840 --> 00:41.280]  Amazon Prime. Or like a traditional cable network like TBS has had Friday night baseball for the
[00:41.280 --> 00:46.960]  last 10 years or something like that. It's sort of a new national franchise. And the basic idea
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.880]  is there are two games every Friday. What time of the day are they though?
[00:52.880 --> 01:00.160]  I think that they're always, you know, there's an East Coast seven o'clock in the evening game and
[01:00.160 --> 01:04.960]  then a West Coast seven o'clock in the evening game, which for me and you on the East Coast
[01:04.960 --> 01:11.040]  would be like 10 or 1030 or something like that. Well, did you notice this that they were,
[01:11.040 --> 01:13.840]  so it's Apple. Apple is California based. Right.
[01:13.840 --> 01:17.920]  I've always said they have a real California bias with things like Touch ID where, you know,
[01:17.920 --> 01:21.280]  on the East Coast we wear gloves in the winter and suddenly you can't unlock your phone. Did
[01:21.280 --> 01:24.320]  you notice that they were promoting the game times in Pacific time?
[01:24.320 --> 01:30.960]  Yes, I absolutely did. And that's strange to me because plenty of stuff is out of LA,
[01:30.960 --> 01:35.600]  you know, TV wise, movie wise, obviously, but I think TV wise too. But everything in my lifetime
[01:35.600 --> 01:42.000]  has always been, you know, seven o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Central. And you never see a Pacific
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.800]  time zone mentioned. So I think Apple is really, they're throwing their weight around there getting
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.000]  the Pacific time zone in there. Yeah, I definitely think that
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  whoever did it at Apple, whoever made that decision is a lifelong Californian.
[01:56.000 --> 01:56.880]  West coaster. Yeah.
[01:56.880 --> 02:01.920]  Yeah, West coaster and is sort of putting their thumb on the scale and, you know, all right,
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.120]  fair enough. You know, you're a California company. You want to make Pacific times primary
[02:07.120 --> 02:11.840]  and Eastern and, you know, poor, poor mountain time.
[02:12.640 --> 02:14.960]  Mountain time's the coolest one. That's got the best name.
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.320]  You know, it's by far the best name. Central is boring. East is where the East,
[02:20.320 --> 02:24.240]  Pacific, all right, it's all right. But mountain time, that's good stuff.
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.120]  Right. Well, but nobody's ever going to, I don't think,
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.240]  I don't think there's ever going to be a company headquartered in say,
[02:32.240 --> 02:34.480]  what's the biggest city in mountain zone? It's got to be Denver.
[02:34.480 --> 02:36.800]  It's got to be Denver, I think. I don't think anybody,
[02:36.800 --> 02:40.000]  even if they were headquartered in Denver is going to broadcast there.
[02:40.880 --> 02:44.000]  No, because the math doesn't, you've got to subtract an hour for Pacific,
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.760]  you've got to add two hours for East Coast. No, it doesn't work. It's too much of a mess.
[02:48.320 --> 02:51.200]  But I did notice that. Well, and the funny thing about it is that
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.000]  then that means, so they're saying 4.10 PM is the first game because 4.10 PM Pacific,
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.440]  that's not really Friday night. That's Friday afternoon baseball.
[02:59.440 --> 03:05.120]  That's Friday afternoon baseball. This got announced a little late.
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.920]  So anyway, last week was the, as we record, and I believe this episode will definitely,
[03:09.920 --> 03:13.520]  since we're recording on Tuesday the 12th, we will, this show will be out
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.880]  before this week's edition of Friday night baseball. So, but we've, you know,
[03:16.880 --> 03:23.120]  we've got one week under our belts. I watched with great enthusiasm just to see what it was like.
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.320]  I kind of like seeing a new broadcast like that anyway. You know, like I might, I would,
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.840]  maybe I wouldn't take such scrupulous notes if it were on Amazon, but I still would have tuned in.
[03:33.840 --> 03:36.480]  Would have checked it out, sure. Well, did you, so have you watched, I don't know,
[03:36.480 --> 03:38.880]  the past couple of years there have been like YouTube broadcasts.
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.840]  I think Facebook had a broadcast at one point. I don't even, I've, I've tuned into a little bit
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.160]  of these. I, I watch Red Sox games. I watch most of them. And then I watch national games
[03:48.160 --> 03:52.320]  sporadically until the playoffs. But yeah, I did the same thing you did. I tuned into this and,
[03:52.320 --> 03:56.160]  and sort of, I don't think we'd even talked about it beforehand, but I thought maybe it'd
[03:56.160 --> 04:03.280]  be something we'd talk about on the show and then now it is. Well, it's, for those who aren't
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.160]  baseball fans, one of the weird things, and you and I have talked about this at great length,
[04:08.160 --> 04:16.160]  is so if you, baseball is a very long season, six months and 162 games in the regular season,
[04:16.160 --> 04:21.520]  which is a lot of, that's a lot of baseball, even if you're a fan. But that means that like your
[04:21.520 --> 04:29.840]  hometown network gets a hundred and maybe not 162 games because when your team is on national TV,
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.800]  they don't broadcast it. It depends on, if you're a Yankees fan, if you're a Red Sox fan, you lose
[04:34.800 --> 04:39.120]  10, 20 games a year to ESPN, to Friday Night Baseball, to things like that. But yeah,
[04:39.120 --> 04:44.320]  100, 140, 150 games for the hometown announcers. Right. And if you're, you know, the Florida
[04:44.320 --> 04:50.640]  Marlins, well, you get closer to 162 games on your local, your local affiliate.
[04:51.280 --> 04:55.440]  Now, now, now the Miami Marlins, John. Oh, Miami Marlins. That's right. Miami Marlins.
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.000]  I don't expect to see, I don't know. I don't want to poke fun at the smaller market teams,
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.120]  but it's, you know, let's say 150 games. There are occasional, I guess it depends how much the
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.920]  networks bid for the games. So the Yankees, Red Sox game over the weekend, one of the games over
[05:11.920 --> 05:16.160]  the weekend was also on Fox. Did you notice that or did you not even know? No, I didn't see that.
[05:16.160 --> 05:21.360]  That was like the Saturday game. Yeah. I think the Saturday game. Yeah. Because Sunday night was on
[05:21.360 --> 05:27.920]  Sunday with ESPN. So it's a good example. So Saturday afternoon, Fox had a national
[05:27.920 --> 05:33.840]  Fox sports network, had a national telecast of the Yankees Red Sox game, but it wasn't exclusive.
[05:33.840 --> 05:39.200]  And so Yankees fans, I still had my local, I assume you still had your local. Right. But then
[05:39.200 --> 05:45.680]  Sunday night for Sunday night baseball, which is an ESPN franchise and has been for quite a long
[05:45.680 --> 05:50.960]  time, that's an exclusive. And so the local networks didn't have it. But anyway, where I'm
[05:50.960 --> 05:55.600]  going with this though, is that the local networks have so much more experience broadcasting these
[05:55.600 --> 06:02.960]  games and they get really good at it and they've got cameras and they just know how to do slow
[06:02.960 --> 06:09.280]  motion and when to expect there might be a close tag play at second base, make sure there's a high
[06:09.280 --> 06:14.720]  speed slow motion camera with a good angle. And then the playoffs start. And it's the biggest
[06:16.720 --> 06:21.680]  shit sandwich. It really is. Your team makes the playoffs and you're like, this is great. They're
[06:21.680 --> 06:26.240]  going to win the world series. But now I've got to listen to these horrible announcers who don't
[06:26.240 --> 06:32.640]  know nearly as much as I, a fan who's watched all season, know. And the production, as you just
[06:32.640 --> 06:37.760]  said, they don't. It's strange to me because obviously ESPN, Fox, TBS, these are national
[06:37.760 --> 06:42.720]  companies with all kinds of money, but somehow they can't hire people who, I think you're right,
[06:42.720 --> 06:47.360]  I think it's just the experience of doing 150 games makes you better at it than someone who
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.880]  comes in to do a national broadcast for, you know, 10, 20 games every fall. Yeah. And I don't know,
[06:52.880 --> 06:59.280]  you know, I don't tune in randomly. I mean, one thing is I subscribe to the MLB app and I know,
[06:59.280 --> 07:03.520]  I think you and I have talked about this on the show, like baseball's TV rights are so
[07:04.080 --> 07:09.520]  complicated. They're really worst, but it's so bad, but there's these local restrictions on the
[07:09.520 --> 07:14.800]  MLB app that are still in play. Here we are in 2022. I mean, and this has been, I think I've
[07:14.800 --> 07:21.360]  been subscribing. I don't remember when I didn't subscribe. I mean, I don't even know how long ago.
[07:21.360 --> 07:25.360]  I know at least 10 years. I can remember being with you 10 years ago and you were watching the,
[07:25.360 --> 07:31.840]  watching MLB TV. Yeah. But I'm lucky because my favorite team, the Yankees, is out of market in
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.240]  Philadelphia. So I get to watch all of their games, except if they're playing the Phillies,
[07:38.240 --> 07:44.320]  which happens every couple of years due to the way inter league scheduling works. Then I can't
[07:44.320 --> 07:51.120]  cause it's on my local TV and I have to watch the Phillies telecast on terrestrial TV or through
[07:51.120 --> 07:56.800]  some online service that shows you terrestrial TV uninterrupted. It's very strange. And then,
[07:56.800 --> 08:04.640]  then these local broadcast teams that spend 162 games following the team, then the playoffs start,
[08:04.640 --> 08:08.080]  if you're lucky, if your team is lucky enough to get into the playoffs, then that's it. They're,
[08:08.080 --> 08:12.160]  they're done. They don't get to broadcast. Which is kind of a shame.
[08:12.160 --> 08:17.360]  It really is. Well, and, and I don't know, they, they often do, you know, pre-game stuff and
[08:17.360 --> 08:22.080]  post-game stuff and, but it's, it's not nearly as good. And, and I'm sure they're disappointed
[08:22.080 --> 08:27.200]  to not be able to do it. And as a fan, you're disappointed to not hear your team getting,
[08:27.200 --> 08:31.760]  you know, your, your announcing team that you've, you know, people, people always say,
[08:31.760 --> 08:35.040]  these announcers always say, you know, thank you for letting us come into your home. And they
[08:35.040 --> 08:39.200]  really do. We, we listen to these people for, like you said, 150 games a year, two, three hours a
[08:39.200 --> 08:43.200]  game minimum. You're talking about hundreds of hours a year. It's honestly, it's even more than
[08:43.200 --> 08:47.680]  your podcast, you know, in terms of content, in terms of time, that you really do get to know
[08:47.680 --> 08:54.480]  these people. Imagine if I had my podcast 162 times in, in the next six months, starting from
[08:54.480 --> 09:00.160]  now. Yeah, just in half a year, even. In the next six months, there'll be 162 episodes and the
[09:00.160 --> 09:04.960]  average episode length will go up. Well, it'll actually be higher, right? Slightly higher.
[09:04.960 --> 09:10.080]  Yeah, that's, it's a lot of talking. And I also think it's, you know, I, as somebody who
[09:11.520 --> 09:17.360]  feels mentally exhausted after doing my show, three, roughly three times a month,
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.360]  two hours-ish, two plus hours, I, I'm mentally exhausted at the end. And it's,
[09:23.360 --> 09:28.800]  it's given me a tremendous appreciation for daily broadcasters, people who I've been,
[09:28.800 --> 09:34.560]  I've been thinking more about it lately, just of all sorts, somebody like a Jimmy Kimmel or
[09:34.560 --> 09:39.760]  Stephen Colbert or Seth Meyers, who hosts four times, four nights a week, hour long show,
[09:39.760 --> 09:47.520]  talk radio, like AM talk radio, like the, the Rush Limbaugh style or sports talk, you know,
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.560]  there's all sorts of ways to do talk radio, but those, those hosts on like talk radio do
[09:52.560 --> 09:57.600]  four hours in the afternoon every day. I mean, it's real work. It's, it's, and,
[09:57.600 --> 10:00.960]  and you wouldn't necessarily think it just, oh, you're just sitting there talking like you,
[10:00.960 --> 10:04.960]  like you said, it does get exhausting. I think of, I mean, he's retired now,
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.840]  but Vin Scully worked until he was how old? Oh, he was like 82, something?
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.400]  In his depth, I think older than that. I mean, he, towards the end, he was not doing, doing a ton,
[10:14.400 --> 10:20.560]  but- He wasn't doing road games for the Dodgers. Right. Well, I mean, good for him. He earned that.
[10:22.080 --> 10:26.800]  That's pretty damn good. I, you know, a lot of respect for that. And he was great.
[10:26.800 --> 10:34.240]  Well, for a small market team, like the Dodgers, maybe. No, he was absolutely great, but yeah,
[10:34.240 --> 10:40.560]  it's just, you know, it's a deep, deep appreciation for being able to hold people's interests and sort
[10:40.560 --> 10:45.520]  of hold their affection. I don't know. I mean, it's like, how can you not be, sometimes I wonder
[10:45.520 --> 10:51.360]  how can people not be like sick of me by now? Like, maybe you love talking about all these
[10:51.360 --> 10:59.120]  nerdy things like fonts and Apple computers and their operating systems and the company strategy
[10:59.120 --> 11:04.160]  and the occasional rant on baseball and an extended rant on the graphic design of the
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.160]  fonts in the Apple baseball thing. Scorebug, sure, yeah, which we're going to get to.
[11:10.160 --> 11:15.200]  This might all be things that are like, yes, this is why the talk show is my favorite podcast. But
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.920]  it's like, sometimes I just think, aren't you sick of me by now? I'm glad you're not,
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.800]  whoever you are out there. I'm very, very glad that you're not, but you're going to next week,
[11:24.800 --> 11:28.800]  you're going to see the listener numbers crater. Everyone's going, you know what? He's right. He's
[11:28.800 --> 11:34.000]  a smart guy and he's right. And I'm sick of him. Let's go. Canceled. Deleted. Unsubscribed.
[11:34.560 --> 11:40.560]  You know what's funny? Amy and I are going through old Seinfeld's Netflix,
[11:40.560 --> 11:47.840]  which I mostly haven't watched since it was like on primetime back in the mid-deleted.
[11:47.840 --> 11:54.160]  Oh, I've done Seinfeld. Not lately, but I've done Seinfeld reruns for years. That's a great
[11:54.160 --> 12:00.000]  background show. It is, but I'm sort of watching them new. And for some reason, I don't know why.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.200]  I think I started with season four. I could check somewhere. I wrote it. But I think I skipped
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.960]  seasons one to three for reasons I just don't know. I just saw an episode of season four,
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.400]  and Netflix suggested it. I was like, yeah, I would like to, why don't we watch that before
[12:16.400 --> 12:21.680]  we go to bed? But there was an episode we just watched last night from season seven where George,
[12:22.800 --> 12:30.560]  they're in the coffee shop and a couple comes over who'd been having troubles. And the gist of the
[12:30.560 --> 12:38.560]  plot is Jerry and Elaine are both interested in the people in this couple. And then they come
[12:38.560 --> 12:44.000]  over and say, hi. George comes and they introduce themselves. And the woman is a doctor and the man
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.240]  is a salesman of some site. And George says, a salesman? And he looks at the woman. He goes,
[12:48.240 --> 12:55.360]  you could have done so much better than him. And then she goes home and says she thought about it
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.320]  and thought, you know what? I think I could do better. And that's. But somehow she decides George
[13:00.320 --> 13:05.920]  is better because as I recall, he said, God bless you when she sneezed. I forget. I don't know. I
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.800]  believe that's right. But it's, you know, but I might've just done that to myself. It's possible.
[13:10.800 --> 13:17.360]  Well, just put the seed in listeners' heads. All I can tell you if you are out there and that
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.840]  thought is now bouncing around your head is there really are not very many podcasts out there.
[13:22.480 --> 13:25.760]  No, there's nothing else to listen to. So don't bother looking elsewhere.
[13:26.720 --> 13:30.160]  Don't look around. You got to fill your time with something. And it might as well be this
[13:30.160 --> 13:32.880]  because there's nothing else. That's a ringing endorsement, right?

[15:24.880 --> 15:29.680]  that was one of the first things that kind of hit me about Apple's Friday night baseball telecast
[15:29.680 --> 15:33.760]  was I actually had the question before. I wasn't even sure if they were going to have
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.360]  regular commercials. They would have ads at all. Yeah. Right. Like what's Apple in this for,
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.120]  right? Like why, why, you know, let's big, big picture, broad strategy. Why does,
[15:43.120 --> 15:49.360]  why did Apple pay Major League Baseball for the rights to do two national telecasts every Friday
[15:49.360 --> 15:53.600]  night for baseball season? I mean, the obvious answer they're doing the first, what did they
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.800]  say? The first half of the season is free. And then after that, you're going to have to be an
[15:56.800 --> 16:01.760]  Apple TV plus subscriber. So they want to juice their numbers. They want to get more subscribers
[16:01.760 --> 16:06.880]  and the rest of the service doesn't have ads. So it's, it's very, it definitely is. Once you
[16:06.880 --> 16:10.960]  stop and think about it, if you watch baseball, yeah, of course there's ads. There's every,
[16:10.960 --> 16:14.480]  every, you know, 10 minutes, there's a break for the half inning and got to fill that with
[16:14.480 --> 16:20.240]  something. But if you put this on, if HBO had baseball, would they put ads on? I don't know
[16:20.240 --> 16:26.480]  because they've never had it or Netflix, right? Like, and, and, and just by sheer coincidence,
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.720]  Ben Thompson had wrote last week and you know, the analysts have been chewing this around. Like,
[16:30.720 --> 16:35.440]  it looks like I don't want to get sidetracked talking about Netflix, but it looks like Netflix
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.960]  growth worldwide is slowing. And for the, for the very good reason of,
[16:40.960 --> 16:45.600]  There's not too many more people left to capture. Right. Amongst people who have
[16:45.600 --> 16:53.440]  internet access and, you know, eight to 10 bucks at least per month, they've got most of them
[16:53.440 --> 17:00.400]  subscribed, which if you were a normal business, you, someone would think, well, that's an amazing
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.960]  business. But if you're a publicly held company, if you're publicly traded, then, then your growth
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.920]  is flat lined and, and your stock is almost worthless now. Right. And so where's the growth
[17:09.920 --> 17:13.840]  going to come from? It doesn't matter how big you already are and how sustainable it is and how
[17:13.840 --> 17:18.160]  loyal your customers are. Growth, growth, growth. And so people are talking about Netflix adding
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.720]  ads and Netflix has long said, we, we, you know, we, we don't want to do ads. We don't want to have
[17:22.720 --> 17:26.880]  an ad based here, blah, blah, blah. I don't know. I, you know, maybe that's one of the reasons they
[17:26.880 --> 17:32.400]  don't have sports. It's kind of, you know, I don't, it's a good question. I guess I wonder
[17:32.400 --> 17:38.000]  how much I have no idea on in terms of numbers, but you know, how much money did they, are they
[17:38.000 --> 17:42.560]  making on the ads? I mean, it's millions upon millions. Is it tens of millions? Is it hundreds
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.840]  of millions for the season? It's, it would definitely be a lot of money to just be leaving
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.760]  on the table and I guess showing some Apple TV ads, but beyond that, and maybe, maybe some Mac
[17:51.760 --> 17:56.080]  ads, maybe some iPad ads, but it'd be a lot of money to be leaving on the table to not sell
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.480]  these ads because there's a ton of ad time during a baseball game. Well, that's, see now that's one
[18:00.480 --> 18:05.280]  of the things that's fascinating about the differences between sports is that baseball
[18:05.280 --> 18:10.880]  has very natural ad time. You know, in between half innings, you know, one team, you know,
[18:10.880 --> 18:14.960]  the three outs. Now you're, you're half of the innings over. You have to switch sides,
[18:14.960 --> 18:19.600]  the catcher. More than any other sport. It's like clockwork that you're going to have these breaks.
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.000]  Right. The pitcher has to come out and start warming up to get ready to throw. You can't
[18:24.000 --> 18:27.920]  just come out and start throwing a hundred miles an hour without a couple of warmups.
[18:27.920 --> 18:32.880]  Players have to get out to the outfield and warm up their arms a little. The catcher might have to
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.400]  put their equipment back on if they, if they were just up or were ready to be up. You got about
[18:38.400 --> 18:44.240]  three minutes in there. It, it, if you go to a minor league game or a high school game, you know,
[18:44.240 --> 18:49.040]  just go to a high school game that's not even on TV or televised other than parents holding their
[18:49.040 --> 18:54.320]  phones out to watch it. There's three minutes between innings where if you were broadcasting
[18:54.320 --> 18:59.520]  it, you might as well, why not put ads as opposed to the beauty. And again, I'm not a huge soccer
[18:59.520 --> 19:03.840]  fan, but I do have to admit every four years when I watched the world cup, I do, I think it's,
[19:03.840 --> 19:10.160]  it's just lovely, absolutely lovely that when they start playing the half of a game of soccer,
[19:10.160 --> 19:16.800]  it just goes and goes and goes until the half is over and that's it. Well, or unless a player flops
[19:16.800 --> 19:21.840]  with a fake shin injury and then you just sit there and watch them sit there and five minutes
[19:21.840 --> 19:27.280]  go by and they add on two minutes at the end. I don't even get me started on soccer timekeeping,
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.520]  but I do agree that it's, it's nice to just have a continuous flow of action.
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.200]  I, yeah, if you and I ran FIFA, which we should, because it's a corrupt organization,
[19:37.200 --> 19:42.320]  could use some outside blood, especially from two Americans who don't really know much about soccer.
[19:42.320 --> 19:46.800]  I don't even really know the sport, but this is a stellar idea.
[19:46.800 --> 19:51.280]  We would have, the first change, I think you and I would agree, the first change we would institute
[19:51.280 --> 19:58.480]  is there would be a real clock that, proper clock, yeah, and everyone from the fans in the stadiums
[19:58.480 --> 20:02.960]  to the coaches, to the players could see how much time was left in the half. And if some,
[20:02.960 --> 20:07.120]  Instead of just the one official who's got it in his head and eventually decides,
[20:07.120 --> 20:08.640]  yeah, I'm going to blow the whistle now it's over.
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.800]  And I know I don't, don't yell at me soccer fans. I know that there's some sort of, you know,
[20:15.440 --> 20:21.760]  magic gift of a soccer referee's mind where they know not to just blow it mindlessly at this
[20:21.760 --> 20:26.480]  moment, like, oh, wait till the ball goes out of bounds or something like that off, off the pitch,
[20:26.480 --> 20:31.600]  whatever they call it, then blow the whistle and call the game over. Nonsense. You got to have a
[20:31.600 --> 20:36.640]  clock. But it is lovely that they don't have commercial breaks. They just don't. And so
[20:36.640 --> 20:42.320]  they've worked around it. Obviously there's tons of money to be made worldwide in soccer
[20:42.320 --> 20:47.280]  television rights. But this is part, I've always heard, and I believe this is part of why it's not
[20:47.280 --> 20:51.600]  that popular in the US is that you can't, you know, we've got major league soccer, we've got
[20:51.600 --> 20:57.280]  MLS, but it's not nationally broadcast because they can't put ads in it. At least not to the
[20:57.280 --> 21:02.000]  extent that you can with baseball, football, basketball, hockey. One of my favorite stories
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.320]  about sports and TV is that basketball traditionally is a game of four quarters
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.680]  instead of two halves. And like the NBA still plays four quarters, high school, junior high,
[21:13.680 --> 21:19.840]  you know, at that level of play is still four quarters, but top level college basketball is
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.280]  two halves. And that change happened while I was, I don't even, I don't even want to Wikipedia it.
[21:25.280 --> 21:30.480]  It was like, I think sometime in the eighties, but I was, I remember I was a fan of college
[21:30.480 --> 21:35.200]  basketball when they made the switch. And I was like, it, it, it seemed into us like, yeah,
[21:35.200 --> 21:39.120]  this will help the game flow more. Why, why the hell have all these buzz buzzer beat, you know,
[21:39.120 --> 21:45.120]  why have four buzzer beater scenarios a game instead of just two? This feels right for
[21:45.120 --> 21:51.760]  basketball. But then it turns out what they did is they really chopped each half instead of into
[21:51.760 --> 21:57.280]  two parts. They chopped them into three and they put, they call them media time.
[21:57.280 --> 21:59.520]  That's right. There's the four minute timeout, the eight minute time.
[22:00.560 --> 22:05.360]  And like the 12 minute timeout, it's a 20 minute half, but there's these two periods where once
[22:05.360 --> 22:09.520]  you reach like a certain point on the clock, like it might be like eight minutes into the game,
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.720]  the next time any break in the action happens, that's a media timeout. And what they mean by
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.320]  media is commercials. Well, is that, is there, are there only two? So it's 12 minutes and four
[22:20.320 --> 22:25.440]  minutes, I guess, or 12 and eight. I forget. It doesn't matter. You know, and maybe they've
[22:25.440 --> 22:31.680]  tweaked them over the years, but I think that there's two, you know, but that's in addition
[22:31.680 --> 22:36.320]  to the fact that when the coaches call timeout, because they want to like talk to their players or
[22:36.320 --> 22:41.280]  regroup or strategize, or just give the guys a break, a full timeout is long enough to show
[22:41.280 --> 22:49.120]  commercials too. It's, you know, they've optimized for showing more commercials and nobody, when you
[22:49.120 --> 22:52.880]  think about it, nobody would ever do that with a high school basketball game, because there's
[22:53.680 --> 22:59.040]  no reason for it, right? It's the money. Baseball, it's a gift. And, you know, football,
[22:59.040 --> 23:03.840]  there's no doubt in my mind that the NFL, when you watch the NFL, there's no reason for the breaks to
[23:03.840 --> 23:08.640]  take as long as they do. They just- Wow. And like, you know, you score a touchdown, break,
[23:08.640 --> 23:14.000]  extra point, break, kickoff, break. That's where it's really brutal is right after a score,
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.840]  right around a score. Right. You've gotten like seven seconds of clock action from the game,
[23:19.840 --> 23:23.280]  and then you've, but you've been able to show eight minutes of commercials.
[23:25.280 --> 23:29.680]  Well, there's a reason these networks and, you know, there's a reason Monday Night Football is
[23:29.680 --> 23:35.520]  a billion dollar franchise. I know you're not a golf fan, but do you ever watch the golf on TV?
[23:35.520 --> 23:39.840]  My dad used to watch it, and I hated it because I was a kid and, you know, cartoons were on or
[23:39.840 --> 23:45.600]  whatever. So, no. How do the commercials work there? Well, they just show lots of commercials
[23:45.600 --> 23:52.000]  and they're from typically 51 weeks a year, or I guess they don't show golf 52 weeks a year, but
[23:52.800 --> 23:57.520]  all but one weekend a year, they're the exact type of companies that you would think sponsor
[23:58.560 --> 24:04.160]  golf. A game? Yeah. It's erectile dysfunction. It's life insurance. Life insurance.
[24:04.160 --> 24:11.280]  Life insurance, cars, you know, you name it. But the Masters, which just finished this last weekend,
[24:11.280 --> 24:20.000]  is a very strange and unusual golf tournament where it is run not by the PGA. It is not run
[24:20.800 --> 24:28.320]  by the network, CBS. It is run by the Augusta National Golf Club. They call all the shots,
[24:28.320 --> 24:34.480]  and it's always been on CBS, but CBS does, I don't know how long their contracts run, but there have
[24:34.480 --> 24:39.440]  been weird situations over the years where there was a golf announcer, the one guy, his name is
[24:39.440 --> 24:45.440]  Gary something, and he was sort of like the funny golf announcer, which by the standards of comedy.
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.920]  Very bad, but by the standards of golf? Yeah, but he's also like, if you tuned in for half an hour,
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.000]  you might listen to him and think, you know what, if I was going to grab a beer after this,
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.440]  he might be the guy. But he described one of their greens as being so fast. The Masters,
[25:03.440 --> 25:08.640]  when you putt, the greens are extremely, extremely fast. One golfer's described it as
[25:09.280 --> 25:14.480]  putting on a windshield. Very, very fast. Well, he described it as having been bikini waxed.
[25:16.080 --> 25:20.400]  That was his quip on the air. And got in trouble for this?
[25:20.400 --> 25:26.960]  They never announced the Masters again. Wow. And that wasn't CBS's decision. It was the Masters,
[25:26.960 --> 25:33.200]  but they also vastly undersell the ad inventory. This is where I'm going, is for years and years,
[25:33.200 --> 25:38.480]  when I was a little kid, I think they only had two advertisers. I think it was one of them was
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.240]  definitely Travelers, which I don't even think is a company anymore. I think it got bought
[25:42.240 --> 25:47.920]  by some other by somebody else. But that red umbrella logo is etched in my mind. It was like,
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.640]  and so they'd only have like two sponsors for the whole weekend. It was Travelers Life Insurance and
[25:54.640 --> 26:00.320]  like EF Hutton or something like that. And they just limit it to like, and now it's like three
[26:00.320 --> 26:05.120]  or four. I watched a little bit of the Masters over the weekend just to see some Tiger Woods.
[26:05.120 --> 26:11.280]  IBM has been involved now for quite a long time. IBM is one of their sponsors. Rolex is involved
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.600]  at some degree, but it's like just three or four companies like that. And, but here's the weird
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.720]  thing, because they have so few sponsors, they have way fewer breaks in the action.
[26:21.360 --> 26:25.680]  They don't do as many breaks. Yeah. Right. And they just, a lot of times,
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.560]  even when there's nothing to show, like golf has a lot of flexibility because there's just
[26:30.560 --> 26:34.880]  groups of golfers all over the golf course. All 18 holes are in use and you just cut between them.
[26:34.880 --> 26:41.280]  Yeah. Yeah. But for the most part, they show the golfers who are in the lead or close to the lead,
[26:41.280 --> 26:49.120]  or they'll cut away. Or Tiger Woods. Right. There's three groups of golfers. The ones who
[26:49.120 --> 26:53.440]  are in the lead are very close to the lead and they tend to be playing at the back because they
[26:53.440 --> 27:00.400]  start those golfers last. Whoever's leading going into the last day is the last group to come
[27:00.400 --> 27:06.400]  through. And for the most part, nobody who's too far ahead of them generally scores so low on one
[27:06.400 --> 27:11.520]  day that they come into contention. But if they do, they'll just cut ahead to here's so-and-so
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.920]  who's shooting an unbelievable round today. And then they'll also cut away if somebody hits a
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.640]  hole-in-one or a great drive or something. Yeah. Something amazing happens like that,
[27:20.640 --> 27:26.560]  or it knocks an 85-foot putt that goes left, then right, then drops right into the hole.
[27:26.560 --> 27:33.200]  Then they'll cut away to that. But for the most part, whenever the leaders hit their tee shot,
[27:33.200 --> 27:38.960]  and 300 yards away, now they've got minutes to go, then they can just say, here's the scoreboard,
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.880]  cut to commercial. Because you've got minutes before the leaders are going to do anything live.
[27:42.880 --> 27:45.760]  To get all the way to their ball. Yeah. Right. But when you watch the Masters,
[27:45.760 --> 27:52.800]  it's way more soothing. For somebody who hates golf, they should record the Masters every year.
[27:52.800 --> 27:58.320]  And if they have trouble sleeping, they could just put it on. And it's so soothing. And if
[27:58.320 --> 28:04.320]  there's nothing going on and there's no golfers on hole 10 doing something interesting, they just
[28:04.320 --> 28:11.360]  play this soothing Masters music and just show beautiful footage of the golf course from a drone.
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.720]  It's really quite—when you're used to the way most sports are on TV, where it's as many
[28:18.720 --> 28:24.400]  commercials as they can possibly fit in, the fact that they just luxuriate in not showing you that.
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.880]  In some grass. Right. I looked this up. Do you know what Tiger Woods—so he finished,
[28:30.880 --> 28:32.880]  I think, 47th? Yeah.
[28:32.880 --> 28:35.360]  Do you know what he made for that? No.
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.360]  I love this. Because if you finish a golf tournament, I think everybody gets some
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.160]  last place if you finish. I think it still might even be a thousand bucks, whatever it is.
[28:44.160 --> 28:49.600]  I believe he got $44,000, which is just such a hilarious number to me. It's a ton of money.
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.720]  It's a great amount of money. But it's Tiger Woods who's worth, I assume, hundreds of millions
[28:54.720 --> 28:59.360]  of dollars, has sponsorships still that are worth millions, tens of millions of dollars.
[28:59.920 --> 29:03.920]  He played four rounds of golf and earned $44,000 last weekend.
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.160]  To finish third to last or something like that. To finish near the bottom, yeah.
[29:08.160 --> 29:14.320]  But I will say this. It was a pleasure to watch him play. That's after making the cut. In the
[29:14.320 --> 29:19.440]  first two rounds, there's way more golfers and you have to—the Masters is also unusual compared to
[29:19.440 --> 29:25.760]  other tournaments where they invite a lot of amateurs and stuff like that. But then the cut
[29:25.760 --> 29:30.880]  is extremely exclusive. Making the cut there is actually more— It's very difficult.
[29:30.880 --> 29:33.440]  Very difficult. And was he—I don't even know,
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.160]  you probably know—was he able to play as a former champion? Are they just always allowed?
[29:40.480 --> 29:46.080]  I forget how much—there are certain rules where if you win any of the major tournaments,
[29:46.080 --> 29:51.280]  the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship, you get an automatic invitation
[29:51.280 --> 29:55.600]  to the Masters. If you've previously won the Masters, I believe you have a lifetime—
[29:55.600 --> 29:56.640]  I think that's right.
[29:56.640 --> 29:57.200]  —invitations.
[29:57.200 --> 30:02.000]  Because he hasn't done anything, but then he just decided to roll into Augusta and
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.120]  play four rounds of golf.
[30:03.120 --> 30:08.720]  Right. But the U.S. Open, because it's truly an open championship, run by the
[30:09.840 --> 30:15.200]  United States Golf Association. And so any kind of organization like that has a rule book
[30:15.200 --> 30:19.520]  and here's what you have to do to qualify for the U.S. Open, right? And you could just—it's
[30:19.520 --> 30:23.600]  like a computer algorithm. You can just check or X whether you qualify or not.
[30:23.600 --> 30:28.320]  The Masters, because the Augusta National Golf Club has ultimate say, can just say,
[30:28.320 --> 30:33.280]  yeah, but we're also going to invite Jack Nicklaus. Even though he's 84 and, you know,
[30:33.280 --> 30:37.520]  obviously he's not going to be competitive, but he gets to play if he wants, you know.
[30:37.520 --> 30:39.360]  All right. How did we get on golf? Let's talk baseball.
[30:39.360 --> 30:40.000]  Well, we're talking commercial.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.600]  Let's talk a different boring sport.
[30:41.600 --> 30:48.320]  So we were talking about the big question. Is Apple even going to have ads on Friday
[30:48.320 --> 30:52.160]  Night Baseball or will they only be for other Apple products? And it gets to the question
[30:52.160 --> 30:56.800]  of what's Apple's point here. Are they trying to make money with Friday Night Baseball?
[30:58.000 --> 30:58.640]  Directly.
[30:58.640 --> 31:04.240]  Right. Like, all right, Major League Baseball charged them—I have no idea what it would cost.
[31:05.040 --> 31:09.120]  We'll make up a number. They had to pay $500 million to have these games this year. That's
[31:09.120 --> 31:13.120]  probably high, but whatever. Yeah. $500 million this year. Are they trying to sell $501 million
[31:13.120 --> 31:14.720]  worth of ads? Right.
[31:14.720 --> 31:18.320]  Slash subscriptions, slash Apple products, slash whatever.
[31:18.320 --> 31:24.800]  Right. So, yeah. So it would be—if they were purely in it to make a profit, it would be the
[31:25.360 --> 31:31.120]  number of ads that they sell and their share of those ads, which I don't think is 100% for
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.040]  reasons we'll get into. Yeah, right.
[31:33.040 --> 31:40.960]  The net additive number of TV Plus paid subscribers who they think came because of the
[31:40.960 --> 31:46.800]  baseball, which they'll never know, right? And this isn't like, oh, Apple doesn't track people.
[31:46.800 --> 31:51.040]  It's like, how could anybody know for sure? No, you've heard about Ted Lasso and you think,
[31:51.040 --> 31:53.920]  eh, maybe I'll check it out. And then you hear about baseball and you say, well, I like
[31:53.920 --> 31:57.840]  baseball too. Now there's two things that I'm interested in. I'll subscribe.
[31:57.840 --> 32:03.920]  But you could probably come close to at least a decent spitball guess by looking at people
[32:03.920 --> 32:15.200]  who didn't have a paid subscription that gave them TV Plus access, who did after April of
[32:15.200 --> 32:24.800]  2022, and who watched some Friday night baseball, right? That's the sort of tracking that I assume
[32:24.800 --> 32:27.920]  Apple does with TV Plus, right? That they would look at something.
[32:27.920 --> 32:29.280]  They can see what you're watching. Yeah, sure.
[32:29.280 --> 32:33.440]  Right. I mean, because they know, you know, they make suggestions and stuff. Now, do they
[32:33.440 --> 32:38.640]  anonymize that and look at it in the aggregate? I presume they do. I mean, and I don't think
[32:38.640 --> 32:44.720]  that's contrary to their privacy argument because they don't care about you, Paul Kefauver.
[32:44.720 --> 32:48.240]  What John is watching. Yeah, they care about what 10,000 people are watching.
[32:48.240 --> 32:52.400]  Right. But they obviously try to, you know, look at who's watching which shows. And if
[32:52.400 --> 32:57.440]  nobody is watching Severance, which I hope is not true, because I love that show. It's like
[32:57.440 --> 33:01.360]  my favorite new show. But like, if nobody watched it, it's like, they're not going to renew it,
[33:01.360 --> 33:06.560]  right? Like, you know, so there's some net additive number of subscribers that they will
[33:06.560 --> 33:11.200]  get out of this. And what else? How else could they make money? Oh, the promotional value
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.280]  that they get for free ads, you know, for their own Apple products, telling people to buy the
[33:17.280 --> 33:24.800]  new iPhone 13, which is now in green. They obviously advertised a lot of Apple TV shows.
[33:24.800 --> 33:28.400]  What else? How else could they make money from this? I don't think they're going to make money.
[33:28.400 --> 33:34.640]  And I think they know that they're not. That's my guess is that they paid more for prestige
[33:34.640 --> 33:43.280]  for the rights. Obviously, the most broadcast companies that show sports do so to make money,
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.680]  right? Like when CBS shows the Super Bowl, they do it in an NFL football every Sunday afternoon.
[33:50.240 --> 33:57.120]  And they pay the NFL billions of dollars per year for the rights to do it. So many people watch
[33:57.120 --> 34:03.200]  football that they think that they make money on that, right? That's what's so tricky if you're
[34:03.200 --> 34:11.440]  like a traditional company, like NBC or CBS. And these streaming services like Amazon and Apple
[34:11.440 --> 34:16.800]  come in and might have different strategies and are just willing to write a check for a couple
[34:16.800 --> 34:21.280]  hundred million dollars for baseball rights because that's just, you know, what's like a huge
[34:21.280 --> 34:28.000]  deal to CBS Sports is like, hey, you know, pocket change to Tim Cook, right? I sort of think that
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.040]  the overall strategy is less about making money directly on Friday Night Baseball, but more just
[34:35.040 --> 34:42.640]  broadly trying to get more people to sign up for not just TV plus as a paid subscription, but any
[34:42.640 --> 34:48.720]  sort of Apple subscription that includes TV plus. Right. Okay. So they've got their bundles with
[34:48.720 --> 34:53.840]  with fitness and right. Apple, the Apple one bundles, right? There's like Apple one and
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.680]  Apple one plus or something. You can always just add a plus, just throw a plus on there.
[34:59.680 --> 35:04.320]  But it's like you can still just pay for Apple music, but it doesn't really make much sense to
[35:04.320 --> 35:10.480]  maybe just pay $9 a month for or $10 a month for Apple music. And that's all you get. But they
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.760]  really want you to spend like 15 or 20 bucks a month and get Apple music and TV plus. And,
[35:15.760 --> 35:20.160]  you know, guess what, some extra iCloud storage, blah, blah, blah. They just want more people
[35:20.160 --> 35:26.160]  to be on a tier like that. And I think that's my guess is that adding some sort of sports
[35:26.160 --> 35:35.280]  is a way to sort of expand that into new demographics. Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.920]  It's very strange because you mentioned that this was announced late. Baseball was potentially
[35:39.920 --> 35:44.000]  in a strike situation and or a lockout rather, I should say, because it was the owners, not the
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.920]  players. But there was the potential that the season wasn't going to start on time and that it
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.760]  wasn't going to happen at all. So then, yeah, when Apple announced this, what, in March, I guess,
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.560]  right? They announced it in March. And we said, well, if there's baseball, there will be baseball
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.440]  on Apple TV. But if there's not baseball, then there won't be. But they announced it like four
[36:01.440 --> 36:06.400]  weeks before they actually started doing it. And so it's been interesting to see that it wasn't
[36:06.400 --> 36:09.680]  something to anticipate for a long time. It was just, they announced it. And then a few weeks
[36:09.680 --> 36:16.320]  later, there was. Right. And they didn't announce the production details and announcing team and
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.960]  stuff like that until the day before the game. Until like the day before, yeah. Yeah. And I
[36:20.960 --> 36:28.800]  I'm fascinated by that, too, because that's, in my opinion, extremely unusual. I can't recall that
[36:28.800 --> 36:32.400]  ever happening. What I think is most interesting about the production and everything is that
[36:32.960 --> 36:39.280]  the crews that they used are not anybody that you would have seen on ESPN, on TBS,
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.760]  and any of the national broadcasts. First of all, the number of women was phenomenal. They were,
[36:43.760 --> 36:50.080]  I think, in the booth. What did we have? Two women and one guy on both of them? Is that right? Or
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.080]  was there? It doesn't matter. There were at least three women in the booth that I can recall in my
[36:54.080 --> 37:00.160]  head out of six announcers, which is three more than pretty much ever before about five years ago
[37:00.160 --> 37:05.040]  when Jess Mendoza was on ESPN. Yeah. And, you know, most broadcasts, national broadcasts,
[37:05.040 --> 37:10.960]  home broadcasts don't have, don't frequently have women. So it was very cool to see some diversity
[37:10.960 --> 37:16.160]  there. And then even the other announcers that they had were not, you know, they didn't bring in,
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.080]  you know, somebody from ESPN, Karl Ravitch or somebody like that, who's done this before. They
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.520]  brought in people who were more fresh voices, which I really liked. Yeah. Now I wonder how
[37:25.520 --> 37:32.240]  much of that was a deliberate strategy on Apple's part. I think the diversity clearly was deliberate.
[37:32.240 --> 37:36.160]  I mean, I don't think that, I think that they came into this thinking we're going to diversify,
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.600]  especially gender wise, because I think it's safe to say that racially
[37:41.600 --> 37:49.200]  commentators, at least in sports, have been racially diverse for a while. Play-by-play,
[37:49.200 --> 37:52.080]  not so much, which is weird. And I know if you're not a sports fan, you're like,
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.640]  what the hell are you talking about? And it's like, usually for any of these sports, basketball,
[37:56.640 --> 38:01.920]  baseball, hockey, football, there's a play-by-play person as someone who, who went to broadcasting
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.840]  school. Right. And it is just a voice on the radio. Right. Well, even though you're watching
[38:07.840 --> 38:13.920]  on TV, but like you, you can turn your back to the TV though, and follow the game. Like they're
[38:13.920 --> 38:20.000]  telling you, you know, here's the pitch, it's low, it's low and outside, that's ball three.
[38:20.720 --> 38:24.880]  And you know, you're not even watching, you can hear them say this. And it's like, oh, it's a long
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.280]  drive to left field. And you know, then tells you what happens. That's play-by-play. It's telling
[38:29.280 --> 38:32.880]  you what happens. And you can say, well, why is, I've thought about this over the years. Why do
[38:32.880 --> 38:39.600]  you even need that if it's television? Like, is that, here we are 60 years, 70 years into the TV
[38:39.600 --> 38:45.600]  era after radio. Right. That is certainly a vestige of radio. Right. But I think it would
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.520]  drive people. I think there's a, I don't know. I think there's a reason that it works. And maybe it
[38:51.520 --> 38:57.200]  is just tradition, but it does work. But anyway, that role is, in my experience, watching nationally
[38:57.200 --> 39:01.760]  televised games, not as diverse. It's typically not- No, it's a whole lot of white dudes. It's
[39:01.760 --> 39:07.360]  a whole lot of white dudes. So the racial diversity on play-by-play, not so great. Gender
[39:07.360 --> 39:12.560]  diversity on play-by-play, almost non-existent. I think Apple, when they announced that Melanie
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.280]  Newman, who does, she calls games for the Baltimore Orioles, is their East Coast. I don't
[39:17.280 --> 39:20.880]  think they're announcing an East Coast crew and a West Coast crew, but I think that's obviously
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.720]  what's going to happen because if she's calling most games for the Orioles, she can't really
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.040]  zip across the country. But that's, you know, I think that was absolutely deliberate. Now,
[39:31.040 --> 39:36.800]  is it, was it deliberate that they went for up and coming, newer, young, and they are, they were all
[39:36.800 --> 39:43.040]  younger too. That's, you know, it was, and that's, you know, for baseball, honestly, that's another
[39:43.040 --> 39:48.640]  angle of diversity. I would say it's the least important maybe of them, but it was a different
[39:48.640 --> 39:53.680]  group of faces than you typically see. You know, baseball is typically a bunch of 60-some-year-old
[39:53.680 --> 39:57.840]  white dudes talking about the game. This was different. But was it strategic that they didn't
[39:57.840 --> 40:03.520]  get big names, that they didn't go poaching for Carl Ravitch from ESPN or somebody else?
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.840]  Well, you had seen, was this a tweet that you saw? I can't remember what you...
[40:07.840 --> 40:11.520]  Yeah, I'll put it in the show notes. I just added a note to make sure I put it in the show notes.
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.640]  But is it what you're going to say about... That you had seen that they were trying,
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.280]  at least had talked to Bill Simmons, who's a decently big name, formerly of ESPN,
[40:19.280 --> 40:22.240]  and I can't remember who the other name was, but another, another ESPN name.
[40:22.240 --> 40:26.960]  Mina Kimes. That's right. So they had spoken to at least a couple bigger names and,
[40:26.960 --> 40:29.600]  and didn't get them to sign on whatever happened.
[40:30.320 --> 40:35.120]  Yeah, I don't know. Apparently the rumor from the New York Post media reporter was that
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.120]  neither Bill Simmons nor Mina Kimes had interest. I don't even know if Mina Kimes
[40:39.120 --> 40:44.800]  follows baseball. She's a top football, a pro football analyst, and she's terrific.
[40:44.800 --> 40:48.640]  She's really, really astute. But I don't know if she follows baseball. I don't know.
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.240]  But so they did at least make an attempt at some bigger names, although those aren't
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.800]  necessarily big names that have done baseball broadcasts. But yeah, I, I really liked the
[40:58.800 --> 41:03.360]  crews that they had. Katie Nolan, I thought was great on the, on the second broadcast.
[41:03.360 --> 41:07.920]  And, and it really, to me was it, it's where Apple stood out from a lot of the other
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.840]  broadcasts because they all tend to sound the same, which is fine. But this, at least,
[41:13.840 --> 41:16.880]  I felt that there was a difference watching these games. And I think that's something
[41:16.880 --> 41:20.000]  that was a result of who Apple hired for these roles.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.600]  Yeah. One of the things that's been true for a long time, and who knows why it's,
[41:25.600 --> 41:32.720]  it's gender stuff can be so hard to explain, especially when it comes to the media. It's
[41:32.720 --> 41:39.600]  like, but for whatever reason, when the barrier broke, like when I was a little kid,
[41:39.600 --> 41:46.400]  there were no women broadcasting sports period, just none, or at least not nationally.
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.960]  And when they first sort of broke into it, it was always as the sideline reporter, right?
[41:50.960 --> 41:56.320]  So you'd have two, two dudes in the booth. And then when like, there's like an injury.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.320]  And then they call down to a woman on the field.
[41:58.320 --> 42:04.480]  Right. And then it became, I wouldn't say they're all women, but it, the sideline
[42:04.480 --> 42:09.040]  reporters are like in the NFL, I think are majority women. It certainly seems like most
[42:09.040 --> 42:13.440]  of them are. And that's great that there's a role, but it's so weird that, that it's
[42:13.440 --> 42:18.960]  instead of like, all of these jobs are open to the most talented broadcast, you know,
[42:18.960 --> 42:22.560]  to the people who are the most engaging and have the most interesting stuff to say,
[42:22.560 --> 42:28.160]  which clearly would lead to the sort of diversity we're seeing with like Friday night baseball,
[42:28.160 --> 42:34.160]  right? There's absolutely no reason that there shouldn't be more than one or two
[42:34.960 --> 42:39.600]  women calling play-by-play on nationally televised sports in the United States. It's,
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.920]  you know, that's clearly out of whack, you know, it's, it's, but it's so weird that
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.680]  the sideline reporters became like the designated role. Well, we'll definitely have a woman
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.440]  down there. It's, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it, but I guess it's,
[42:53.440 --> 43:00.080]  I don't know. It's almost like group think, right? Like, well, CBS put a, put a woman
[43:00.080 --> 43:04.400]  in the job as sideline reporter and people still watched football. So I guess, you know.
[43:04.400 --> 43:05.520]  I guess we can risk it.
[43:05.520 --> 43:10.720]  Yeah, I guess we can risk it. It's, it's a very, you know, they, they love to look at
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.560]  all the stats and the ratings and, you know, demographics and stuff like that, but it is,
[43:14.560 --> 43:19.600]  there's a lot of risk adversity to the media business. So anyway, I thought the baseball
[43:19.600 --> 43:23.200]  broadcast was good. Well, what other details did you want to talk about? I want to talk
[43:23.200 --> 43:23.440]  about the graphics.
[43:23.440 --> 43:27.280]  Oh, Chris Young really cracks me up. That was, that was the one that I, I sent you while
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.320]  we were watching it. So Chris Young was a player for, he was in the first broadcast
[43:32.320 --> 43:36.080]  and he was a baseball player, retired now, never a superstar, but I think he was decent.
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.880]  He played on the Yankees for a little while and he played on the Red Sox for a little
[43:38.880 --> 43:44.960]  while. And as I was poking at his Wikipedia page, I saw this, this little, this little
[43:45.840 --> 43:53.040]  explanation that he had claimed to have invented, or at least popularized sign stealing in baseball
[43:53.040 --> 43:58.960]  via Apple watch, which both the Red Sox have been accused of and the Yankees. So, you know,
[43:58.960 --> 44:02.480]  neither, neither of our hands are clean on this, but, but I just love that this, that
[44:02.480 --> 44:08.480]  Apple got the guy who, who at least claimed to have popularized using an Apple watch to,
[44:08.480 --> 44:11.840]  to steal signs. And they got them on their very first broadcast with the Friday night
[44:11.840 --> 44:12.400]  baseball.
[44:12.400 --> 44:18.240]  Did you think it, it, it, it is funny. I don't know that they're going to talk about that
[44:18.240 --> 44:18.720]  incident.
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.520]  Probably that will not, I don't know if they've told them not to talk about it, but I bet
[44:23.520 --> 44:24.640]  that will not come up.
[44:24.640 --> 44:30.960]  But it is funny that, that of all people, the one player in all of major league baseball,
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.720]  who, you know, he's not the only one who's been on the Yankees and Red Sox, but he was
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.200]  at the heart of the only micro scandal that involved an Apple product.
[44:39.200 --> 44:42.320]  Yep. And they got him on the very first broadcast.
[44:42.320 --> 44:47.440]  The, the, there's a side note on technology. So, so for those who aren't baseball fans,
[44:47.440 --> 44:52.320]  that baseball has, you're not allowed to have electronics. So like, you can't.
[44:52.320 --> 44:53.120]  In the dugout area.
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.040]  In the dugout, you can't have, well, you can have an iPad, but it can't be hooked up to
[44:57.040 --> 44:57.600]  the internet.
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.280]  Right. So that, that was a recent rule from a couple of years ago. They're like, okay,
[45:01.280 --> 45:05.040]  you can have an iPad, but it can't have any internet access. So you can't get.
[45:05.040 --> 45:10.240]  And the reason for, the reason to have it is they can look at, like there are swings,
[45:10.240 --> 45:13.920]  they can look at how a pitcher throws and prepare for their next at bat. There's all
[45:13.920 --> 45:19.200]  sorts of reasons to use it. They don't have to be stealing signs or cheating, basically.
[45:19.200 --> 45:25.040]  Right. Whereas the NFL has embraced technology for decades, you know, and they they've got
[45:25.040 --> 45:33.200]  coaches who are up in the booth, 300 seats above the field with binoculars and with TVs,
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.600]  and they can show the video. They can look at the video of the game and the last play.
[45:37.600 --> 45:42.400]  And you see the players down there with these Microsoft surfaces through a sponsorship deal,
[45:42.400 --> 45:46.720]  looking at live pictures from like the last time they were on the field and here's how
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.760]  the team signed up and they've got headsets and the quarterbacks have, you know, headsets
[45:51.760 --> 45:55.760]  inside their helmets. So the coaches can call plays and they're talking to each other.
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.000]  Baseball, all of that stuff is illegal. It's there's until.
[46:00.720 --> 46:03.200]  Until. This season.
[46:03.200 --> 46:07.680]  Right. So this season they've added a thing which you and I have talked about offline.
[46:07.680 --> 46:09.920]  What's it? Pitchcom, right? Pitchcom, yeah.
[46:11.200 --> 46:14.000]  This was another thing. There, there was all this stuff that got introduced
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.480]  in like the past couple of weeks, it seems like as a baseball fan. And this was another thing
[46:18.480 --> 46:23.360]  where it wasn't something that had been on my radar anyway, but suddenly is being used
[46:23.360 --> 46:28.320]  in Major League Baseball games for the pitcher and catcher and defense to communicate.
[46:29.760 --> 46:36.640]  It, I would say it sort of looks like the catcher gets a thing that looks like a garage door opener.
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.160]  It's a little black piece of plastic with like a keypad within, I don't know, nine or 10 buttons.
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.320]  Oh, I don't, I'd almost say like a video game controller, but yeah, like, like the,
[46:46.320 --> 46:50.320]  the pin pad outside of a garage door, at least that has a bunch of buttons on it. Yeah.
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.560]  Yeah. I guess a garage door opener typically only has like open and closed buttons or something
[46:54.560 --> 46:57.920]  like that, or, you know, it, yeah. It's, it's weird.
[46:57.920 --> 47:00.800]  It's a little more complex than that, but it's not super complex. It's got,
[47:00.800 --> 47:04.880]  I think you're right. It's about 10 buttons. And, and so basically the catcher's got this,
[47:04.880 --> 47:08.400]  this pad that they can have on their wrist or they can, I've seen some guys wearing it like
[47:08.400 --> 47:15.280]  on their thigh and they, they hit a button and it says fast ball. And that, that plays in the
[47:15.280 --> 47:19.200]  pitcher's ear. It plays in an outfielder's ear, if they're wearing the, the earpiece.
[47:19.200 --> 47:22.800]  And it actually, I, this was an interesting fact was that it plays in the catcher's ear
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.400]  so that they can be sure that they hit the right button, which it makes perfect sense,
[47:26.400 --> 47:31.280]  but it's not necessarily something you'd think of initially. And, and so previously, and still some
[47:31.280 --> 47:37.680]  teams have a system that's been around for gotta be a hundred years of just throwing down fingers
[47:37.680 --> 47:42.720]  to indicate what pitch they want to throw. And now there's this, now we've introduced technology
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.680]  in a way that it makes it much more difficult for the other team to steal those signs and,
[47:47.680 --> 47:52.560]  and know what's coming. Right. And another thing to, for the people out there who are,
[47:52.560 --> 47:58.080]  you know, aren't baseball fans, it is actually, you know, it, I, I remember when I was a kid,
[47:58.080 --> 48:01.200]  when I learned this, I was like, that's amazing. I just thought the pitcher just got up there and
[48:01.200 --> 48:04.640]  threw whatever pitch they wanted and the catcher caught it. Cause that's how we as kids played.
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.520]  That's how little it works. That's how we played, but it, you know,
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.040]  in professional level, they call the exact pitch, not just like fastball,
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.720]  but like fastball outside or fastball inside location. And if they, they call it getting
[48:16.720 --> 48:22.160]  crossed up, like, cause so the sign stealing is, is a huge part of the game has been for,
[48:22.160 --> 48:27.280]  you know, over well over a hundred years and it's, it's, they'll mix up the signs. And so
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.480]  instead of three fingers on my right thigh and then two fingers on this thigh, and that means
[48:32.480 --> 48:38.640]  whatever it, they mix up the signals. But if the, if the pitcher and the catcher have the signals
[48:38.640 --> 48:42.400]  crossed up between them and the pitcher, the pitcher's throwing a fastball when the
[48:42.400 --> 48:46.960]  catcher's expecting a curve ball and the balls in his face before he realizes it's actually
[48:46.960 --> 48:52.480]  dangerous, right? Cause it can like sail past. Cause like a, it's a huge difference in speed,
[48:52.480 --> 48:57.040]  huge difference in where you expect the ball to wind up, you know, 20 to 25 miles an hour
[48:57.040 --> 49:02.160]  difference in speed sometimes. And it could just sail right over the catcher and hit the umpire
[49:02.160 --> 49:04.640]  right in the head or something. I was about to say, it's mostly dangerous for the umpire.
[49:04.640 --> 49:09.120]  Yeah, it is. That's, that's like the worst is when they're expecting off speed,
[49:09.120 --> 49:13.760]  which means a slower curvy, you know, like Frisbee type pitch that's going to bend.
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.320]  And instead it's a 98 mile an hour fastball. It just sails right in the umpire.
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.280]  It just hits the umpire right in the face or something.
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.560]  Right. So it's dangerous. So the, the confirmation that the catcher hears,
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.200]  that's just good user interface design, right? It's like, but it's really interesting that
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.360]  they've added this technology this year. And it's, it, I, when I sent you the link,
[49:31.360 --> 49:36.320]  and I still think it cracks me up. It was, I know the date. It was exactly seven days ago.
[49:36.320 --> 49:42.160]  It was April 5th because I was like, I got to send this to Paul. And then right before I even
[49:42.160 --> 49:46.720]  had it pasted into iMessage, I was ready to send it. And I thought, wait a minute, is this a joke?
[49:46.720 --> 49:47.600]  Is this an April Fool's joke?
[49:47.600 --> 49:51.440]  Is this an April Fool's joke? And I stumbled upon it. I knew it wasn't April 1st anymore,
[49:51.440 --> 49:57.520]  but I thought perhaps I've stumbled on an April 1st joke on MLB.com. And I've just seen it four
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.920]  days late. And Paul's going to laugh at me. Because no, it's completely serious.
[50:03.920 --> 50:08.000]  But if you made up the joke, the keypad that they actually use
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.320]  would be a very good mock-up for the joke.
[50:11.200 --> 50:15.520]  Absolutely. And well, and also you would say that it was created by a company that does
[50:15.520 --> 50:17.280]  communication systems for magicians.
[50:17.280 --> 50:18.800]  And, and mentalists.
[50:18.800 --> 50:23.440]  And mentalists, right. Which is, which is the truth. This company, it's, I assume a
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.720]  relatively small company, but they make communication systems that magicians and mentalists use.
[50:28.720 --> 50:32.800]  And, you know, have to have some sort of wireless communication that most people can't detect,
[50:32.800 --> 50:37.920]  can't see. And that turns out, a whole lot of that translates to making a communication
[50:37.920 --> 50:41.280]  system that a pitcher and catcher use where you don't want the batter who is
[50:41.280 --> 50:45.040]  three feet from the catcher to be able to tell what, what you just did.
[50:45.040 --> 50:48.400]  Well, that's the part two that made me think it might be a joke is that they're not,
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.920]  none of the players are actually wearing earpieces. They've got like a headband in the hat.
[50:53.920 --> 50:55.200]  So is it bone conduction?
[50:55.200 --> 50:58.880]  Yeah, I think, I think, but that's, I would love to know the details of this.
[50:58.880 --> 51:03.120]  If anybody out there has like links to how it actually works, is it, but I presume the
[51:03.120 --> 51:06.800]  only other option is bone conduction, but apparently it's good enough that they can
[51:06.800 --> 51:10.880]  hear it even over the crowd noise, but you don't see, like, you know, it would be funny
[51:10.880 --> 51:14.880]  too, if like on Friday night baseball, it's like, well, can they, can they wear an AirPod?
[51:14.880 --> 51:19.200]  Switch the headphone from whatever generic one to an AirPod.
[51:19.200 --> 51:23.280]  To a white AirPod. Yeah. You don't see like an earpiece in there. It's apparently some
[51:23.280 --> 51:28.240]  apparatus that fits inside their caps, you know, like the pitcher's cap or the shortstop,
[51:28.240 --> 51:33.040]  whoever else has it. And they somehow hear this right now. That sounds really cool,
[51:33.040 --> 51:38.720]  but that's apparently also how like the batter won't hear the catchers, even if like, it's,
[51:38.720 --> 51:43.360]  you know, like you're in Tampa and it's a real quiet, real quiet, real quiet. Watching the
[51:43.360 --> 51:49.360]  game, the batter isn't going to be able to hear curve ball. Oh, thank you. Cause it's just,
[51:49.360 --> 51:54.160]  it's just bone conduction, but that's where, and then that's where the idea that it came
[51:54.160 --> 52:01.760]  from a company that made equipment for mentalists, right? Well, that's, that's exactly what made me
[52:01.760 --> 52:05.920]  like convinced it was an April fool's joke. It was like, oh, it sounds like a joke when
[52:05.920 --> 52:08.880]  you put it that way. Yeah. But at the same time, it makes perfect sense.
[52:08.880 --> 52:14.160]  And the worst part is baseball. I think of all the sports I follow baseball is the one that to
[52:14.160 --> 52:20.480]  me seems most prone to April fool's jackassery. There was famously, I think you're a bit young
[52:20.480 --> 52:25.920]  for this, but you remember the George Plimpton story and it was the back page column in sports
[52:25.920 --> 52:30.800]  illustrated. I don't, I I'm, I'm familiar, but I don't know which story you're talking about.
[52:30.800 --> 52:33.360]  Go ahead. Oh, I got to get the player's name right. Cause it was
[52:33.360 --> 52:40.960]  Plimpton Mets prank. It was like sometime around like 1986. I'm thinking, and it was the,
[52:41.520 --> 52:47.200]  the back page column in sports illustrated and George Plimpton well-regarded very famous for,
[52:47.200 --> 52:50.160]  I guess it wasn't even the back page column. It was a feature. I'm looking at it here. I'll
[52:50.160 --> 52:55.520]  get it in the show notes, the curious case of Sid Finch. And it was about this phenom in the
[52:55.520 --> 53:03.520]  Mets organization who liked to pitch barefoot and could throw 120 miles an hour. And you know,
[53:03.520 --> 53:08.720]  it was an April fool's gag, but you know, people were very upset about it because sports illustrated
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.240]  didn't let, you know, you had to kind of, you know, and I think if you read closely,
[53:12.240 --> 53:16.640]  you'd catch on eventually it'd be like, ah, this is the April 1st edition of sports illustrated.
[53:16.640 --> 53:21.680]  It's a gag, but people were very upset about it. I remember, I don't know what year it was,
[53:21.680 --> 53:28.320]  but I remember watching ESPN and you know, April fool's coincides with the start of baseball
[53:28.320 --> 53:31.520]  season, very beginning of the season, very beginning of the season. Usually the first
[53:31.520 --> 53:36.640]  games are like April 1st or second or something like that. But I remember one time watching ESPN
[53:36.640 --> 53:40.240]  had to be around the late nineties when I mentioned the name of the player, but they said,
[53:40.240 --> 53:45.120]  you know, and it hasn't gotten a lot of hubbub during spring training, but major league baseball
[53:45.120 --> 53:48.880]  players are all very excited about the fact that this is the first year that they'll be allowed to
[53:48.880 --> 53:52.800]  use aluminum bats. And you know, and then they showed, you know, they got, you know, because
[53:52.800 --> 53:56.480]  it's ESPN, they could do it. They showed, you know, some well-known major leaguers taking
[53:56.480 --> 54:01.760]  batting practice with aluminum bats and just drilling balls over the fence. And they're like,
[54:01.760 --> 54:06.080]  there's some concern, you know, the average line drive in major league baseball last three seasons
[54:06.080 --> 54:09.920]  was, you know, 98 miles an hour off the bat or something like that. And they're like, and you
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.800]  know, most of these, you know, even the shortstops now are getting, you know, upwards of 120 miles an
[54:14.800 --> 54:18.800]  hour off the bat. So there's some concern for pitchers' safety. And then they'd like interviewed
[54:18.800 --> 54:22.560]  a pitcher who's like, I hate this rule. This is the worst thing that's ever happened to baseball.
[54:23.040 --> 54:29.040]  Honestly, I'm terrified. And then they cut to Jose Canseco and Oakland A's legend.
[54:29.040 --> 54:31.840]  Steven McLaughlin At his most roided-up state.
[54:31.840 --> 54:34.560]  Jay Famiglietti Right. And he said that he honestly expected,
[54:34.560 --> 54:39.600]  this is where I realized this has got to be a gag. He was like, I honestly expect that I think I could
[54:39.600 --> 54:46.000]  hit 100 home runs this year, you know, at a time when the decades-long Babe Ruth record or...
[54:46.000 --> 54:46.880]  Steven McLaughlin No, Roger Maris.
[54:46.880 --> 54:48.160]  Jay Famiglietti Roger Maris was 61.
[54:48.160 --> 54:48.960]  Steven McLaughlin Sixty-one, yeah.
[54:48.960 --> 54:52.320]  Jay Famiglietti Right. He was like, I think I'll hit 100. If I stay healthy, I'll hit 100, no problem.
[54:52.320 --> 54:55.920]  Steven McLaughlin I'd probably kill about 10, 12 pitchers, too.
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.160]  Jay Famiglietti Right. Anyway, so I was worried about it,
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.520]  but it's kind of interesting. I would love to hear it, right? I would love to hear what this
[55:05.520 --> 55:07.760]  bone conduction sounds like, but... Steven McLaughlin
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.160]  Well, you watched the Sunday Night Game. They had the speaker. I just...
[55:12.160 --> 55:14.320]  Jay Famiglietti Oh, I didn't hear it. I missed that part.
[55:14.320 --> 55:15.600]  Steven McLaughlin Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's right. You
[55:15.600 --> 55:18.320]  were watching the other broadcast. You were watching the terrible other broadcast part of
[55:18.320 --> 55:25.360]  the time. So, they showed the transmitter, sorry, the receiver, and they had it play audio,
[55:25.360 --> 55:30.320]  but it played more like a normal speaker. So, I'm not sure. I got to look this up because I've
[55:30.320 --> 55:34.080]  looked at this a little bit, but yeah, I'm not sure how the audio is being played. Bone conduction
[55:34.080 --> 55:36.960]  certainly makes sense because then no one's going to be able to hear it except for you.
[55:36.960 --> 55:39.280]  Steven McLaughlin But the way that they played it on air,
[55:39.280 --> 55:44.640]  at least, it seemed like it was transmitting sound in a way that could be heard through the air. So,
[55:45.440 --> 55:47.280]  I'll be interested to look this up when we're done.
[55:47.280 --> 55:49.360]  Jay Famiglietti Well, I think that gets back to the fact that
[55:49.360 --> 55:55.280]  they started doing work for mentalists, right? Because if you went to see a guy who claims that
[55:55.280 --> 56:02.000]  he can read minds or speak to the dead or something like that, the things that mentalists do at a paid
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.080]  show, if you saw them with an earpiece, you'd be like, what the hell's going on? He's got an
[56:06.080 --> 56:10.480]  earpiece. I think that they hook it up so that it goes through their glasses or something like that
[56:10.480 --> 56:13.520]  so that it's bone conduction. Steven McLaughlin
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.400]  Yeah, so it definitely is bone conduction. So, I'm not sure how they made that work on air because,
[56:18.400 --> 56:24.240]  as I said, they were playing, they were using the pin pad and then making it say curveball,
[56:24.240 --> 56:25.120]  fastball, whatever. Jay Famiglietti
[56:25.120 --> 56:28.640]  Well, I don't know. I mean, at some point, as you might know, I don't know if you know anything
[56:28.640 --> 56:35.760]  about audio, but at some point, it's just audio in a computer and it could go elsewhere, right?
[56:35.760 --> 56:41.680]  It could just go to, one of the receivers could be something that could just record the actual
[56:41.680 --> 56:45.520]  audio. You know, it doesn't have to be, doesn't mean every receiver has to be bone conduction.
[56:45.520 --> 56:46.080]  Steven McLaughlin It has to be a bone
[56:46.080 --> 56:49.840]  conduction earpiece, yeah. So, yeah, maybe they had something else for demonstrating it.
[56:49.840 --> 56:51.600]  Jay Famiglietti But anyway,
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.960]  technology and baseball. What else on the Friday night baseball? The graphics looked very appley.
[56:56.960 --> 56:57.920]  I think they did. Steven McLaughlin
[56:57.920 --> 57:03.520]  Well, and I sent you one shot where it looked like they were showing some stat. They were showing,
[57:03.520 --> 57:07.520]  you know, the number of hits somebody got last year compared to other players or something.
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.280]  And it looked like a scrollable list. It looked like you could interact with it,
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.040]  because I at least was watching on my Apple TV, and it looked exactly like every control on an
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.400]  Apple TV where you could scroll through the settings or whatever. And there was a little,
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.480]  you noted there was like a little, what looked like a disclosure triangle, which obviously
[57:24.480 --> 57:29.040]  doesn't do anything, but it was just, it was more of an asterisk. But yeah, I found the graphics a
[57:29.040 --> 57:34.560]  little, they looked nice enough, but I found them a little disconcerting because it looked like I
[57:34.560 --> 57:39.040]  could interact with them. And actually, honestly, there's not a reason why you couldn't interact
[57:39.040 --> 57:44.000]  with them. Apple certainly could, with an online only broadcast, make it such that you could,
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.600]  on certain devices, interact and say, oh, tell me more about this stat or whatever.
[57:48.160 --> 57:49.440]  That is not currently how it works. Jay Famiglietti
[57:49.440 --> 57:55.600]  It was sort of the, you know, it's a variation of the uncanny valley. It's instantly recognizable
[57:55.600 --> 58:04.400]  as Apple-like. If this had been, if Amazon had won the bidding and done this, and you would have
[58:04.400 --> 58:10.080]  known, it was like, wait, the license terms for the San Francisco font don't even allow that.
[58:10.080 --> 58:15.840]  You're not, and I know that San Francisco, you're not allowed to use it like that. It looked so
[58:15.840 --> 58:22.880]  instantly Apple-like. And for somebody who's attuned to fonts and Apple's UI styles, you know,
[58:22.880 --> 58:27.440]  you could have kept me away from this news, showed me the broadcast, and I would have instantly
[58:27.440 --> 58:32.000]  figured out, hey, Apple's doing baseball. This is, you know, this has got to be an Apple broadcast.
[58:32.000 --> 58:40.960]  But on the other hand, it is weird that within the confines of Apple's 2D, you know, fonts and
[58:40.960 --> 58:46.560]  colors and, you know, lots of black backgrounds with white text and the way that the highlight
[58:46.560 --> 58:53.280]  looked exactly like the selection highlight on the tvOS. And that's the one out of Apple's,
[58:53.280 --> 58:56.960]  you know, the way that Apple has sort of gone in a similar direction with all their
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.200]  operating systems, but tvOS still sort of looks different. It looked like something I should be
[59:01.200 --> 59:06.320]  able to take my Apple TV remote and go up and down, you know, and you can't. But like you said,
[59:06.320 --> 59:13.200]  why not, right? That's actually very interesting to me is if Apple has more ambitious technical
[59:13.200 --> 59:19.120]  goals. And if this whole thing was sort of delayed until March because of the lockout,
[59:19.120 --> 59:23.520]  like I honestly don't know what was allowed. I know the players and the teams were not allowed
[59:23.520 --> 59:27.920]  to interact at all. So like players weren't allowed to go to the team's health facilities
[59:27.920 --> 59:31.680]  just to like rehab an injury or something like that. They had to do it on their own. That's what
[59:31.680 --> 59:36.160]  lockout meant. But it seemed like other things were prevented, too. So maybe this was all a bit
[59:36.160 --> 59:43.600]  rushed towards the end. But if you're showing it on a computing device, and that's all Apple is,
[59:43.600 --> 59:50.960]  right, they're not simulcasting it to any sort of terrestrial TV. Everything is either like an Apple
[59:50.960 --> 59:57.440]  TV or an iPhone or an iPad or you can watch on the web. But again, that's a computer. It could be
[59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.600]  all those graphics could be interactive. You could have way more interaction with it. Yeah,
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:08.320]  I mean, you've used MLB TV in the MLB app. And that's got way more interactivity than just a
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.440]  traditional broadcast. You can change how it looks. You can pull up different stats. You can do all
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:18.320]  sorts of stuff. And yeah, there's no reason that Apple's broadcasts couldn't allow at least some
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:24.400]  of that. So what's the future hold for Apple TV with the Friday Night Baseball? I don't know. I
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.640]  kind of feel the other thing to wrap this segment up. Well, let me take a break because I have a
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.080]  little bit more to say about Apple TV. All right, we'll get on to audio hijacked for after that. But
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.720]  let me take a break here. And thank our next sponsor. It's our good friends. I love this
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:46.000]  company. I love what they do trade. Coffee, trade coffee is where you go to subscribe to coffee,
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:52.480]  get it delivered right to your home. I've tried it. It is delicious, delicious coffee. It's a
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.640]  great service, what you do. And now here's the part that sounds crazy. They've got let me see
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.920]  if I got it here. My last over 450 roasts that they that they keep. And you think now that that
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.480]  sounds to me at least that sounds like a nightmare. Like why would I go to sign up for a coffee
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.800]  subscription with 450 coffees to choose from? How in the world am I going to pick the best one? I'm
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.920]  going to feel like I'm making a terrible mistake. That's not how it works. They have a sign up. You
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.640]  just answer a couple of questions. You say I'm a new customer. And you start answering a couple
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.080]  of questions about the type of coffee you like the type of tastes you like. And they quickly
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.600]  vary just a couple of questions. But they quickly narrow you down to a personalized variety of
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.120]  coffees to suggest to you and with absolutely no gimmicks. And you can get them delivered
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.920]  as often as you'd like. You want like one bag every month. Do you want two bags a week because
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.040]  maybe you're buying coffee for a whole office or a whole family of coffee drinkers, whatever you
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.160]  want. You can do it. You can adjust it on the fly. And they have a guarantee. You either love
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.480]  your first order or they will replace it for free. So if you get your first order and you're like,
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.800]  I don't even like this coffee, you go back to them, say I didn't like it. And they'll get in
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.600]  touch with you with like some kind of automated thing where they will course correct what didn't
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.520]  you like and make another suggestion and send you that other coffee free of charge. That's how sure
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.760]  they are that you're going to like it. They have delivered over five million bags of fresh coffee,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:22.640]  and they have over 750,000 positive reviews. And the thing I can't say strongly enough about coffee
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:28.880]  is that coffee is a produce. It is like buying fruit or vegetables or something like that. It
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.320]  goes bad quickly. You want your coffee fresh. You want to get it. They roast it, package it,
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.360]  ship it to you. It's within your hands like two days later, fresh coffee. That's the way to go.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.320]  And you can't like stock up on it. It's like you can't stock up on apples for the next three
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.440]  months. Well, you can't. You really shouldn't be stocking up on coffee. But when you go to
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.600]  the supermarket, that's what everything on the shelves is. It's just old, stale coffee that's
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:03:20.640]  drying out. Trade coffee can really solve your problems with that. I love it. It is really great.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.480]  And they'll find a coffee that you will love. Thirty bucks off? What else was going on?
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.520]  So the other thing that we were talking about the commercials before,
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:36.720]  this is the part that really, hmm, that makes me go, I wonder. It looked to me like the sponsors
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.200]  for Friday Night Baseball were largely the same as the ones that MLB tends to have on their own
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.640]  MLB network. They weren't prestige sponsors or anything like that.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.600]  Right. It's the opposite. And that harkens back to my, hark's back. I forget. What do you say there,
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.960]  Paul? Hark's back or harkens back? I think that they're both accepted. This is a little insight
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.080]  into me and Paul's friendship because if I were writing and I haven't even spoken to Paul in a
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.040]  week or something like that, I'll just immediately iMessage Paul with a question like that. He's on
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:11.440]  the copy desk at Daring Fire, Paul. But I'll do that. And then while I'm texting you, then I'll
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:17.200]  start looking it up in the dictionary app. Yeah, it looks like you're right. They're both
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.120]  acceptable. It harkens back to my discussion of the Masters where I thought, and you know,
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:27.040]  I thought it was coincidental that it was Masters weekend, the same weekend Apple was doing this,
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.680]  but I thought that maybe Apple will do something prestige like that and just sort of, instead of
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:39.120]  that bombastic in between innings, boom, boom, boom, you know, go to Chipotle, go to Subway,
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.960]  you know, gamble, gamble, gamble at BetMGM. Crypto, crypto, crypto. Right. Crypto, crypto,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.760]  drink a beer and then go gamble some more. Maybe it'll be more sedate and cool. They could just
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.200]  show like those screensavers like on Apple TV, you know. Oh God, that'd be amazing. Right. You're
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.560]  talking about the like ASMR quality of golf. I would like to just give me those screensavers
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.280]  with a little bit of audio behind them. Right. And some scores from around the league at the
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.200]  bottom. Make sure people know they're still watching the baseball game. There's, they had
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:16.720]  all sorts of options, but really it just looked to me like a white label MLB network broadcast.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:22.240]  It was obvious. They did not go that route. They did not go the route of fewer ads or nicer ads.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.960]  Apple clearly hired all of the talent, right? The announcers, as we discussed that the announcers,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:34.160]  the sideline reporters, the pregame hosts, you know, Apple hired those people. They worked for
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.000]  Apple, but it seemed like the ads went through MLB network or else somehow Apple ended up selling
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.080]  the exact same style of ads. Is it distasteful? Is it, you know, like the whole legalized sports
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:53.040]  betting thing, like sports betting was like, I don't know. It was, it, it, it somehow fell
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:06:01.360]  for most of my life on the vice side of. Is this potential activities? Yeah. Potential activities.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:08.400]  Right. And without getting into any kind of argument about drug policy at a legal level,
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:16.960]  why is it that alcohol has been legal? Well, not forever, but there was a brief period. I don't
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.560]  know if people know since the 18th amendment was repealed with what the 21st amendment 21st
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.960]  amendment. They it's, isn't it funny too, that that amendment didn't last long, but they were
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.480]  amending like gangbusters. Two more in there in between. Yeah, exactly. They got two more in
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.520]  before they repealed it, but it's, you know, legal and it's been obviously as any, you don't have to
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:43.440]  be a sports fan to know that alcohol advertising is, has been a staple of sports commercials ever
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.640]  since it's, ever since TV sports have been a thing, but like, you know, marijuana has been
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:53.600]  illegal in the United States for until very recently and still is regulated on a state by
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.080]  state level. I've, I've never seen any kind of advertising for that. I wonder if it'll start
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:03.120]  New Jersey, which is right across the river from me is on the cusp. They've already voted to make
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:09.120]  recreational marijuana legal in New Jersey. Oh, well, John, are you just talking about TV
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:14.000]  ads or any ads? Well, any ads, but TV ads. Oh, no, no, no. So, so yeah, here in mass,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.840]  it got legalized. I don't even know the timeline. It got legalized a while ago. It's taken some
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.960]  time, but if you drive down a highway, three quarters of the billboards will be dispensary
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.840]  ads. The sides of every trash can in the city are telling you about weed delivery. It's, it's,
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:31.840]  it's going to be huge. As soon as it's legal anywhere, the advertising will be huge. It just
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:38.640]  won't be on TV because that's federal. I think the FCC won't allow that. Yeah, I think you're
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.880]  right. I do think you're right that they won't. Cause it's still, even though a state like New
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:49.440]  Jersey or Nevada or California, Massachusetts, you know, might legalize it. Pennsylvania,
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:56.640]  it is legal for medical purposes only recently. I mean, I think like within the last 18 months,
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.160]  two years, something like that. But now we have, it's still federally illegal. Right. And it's,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.000]  and so like, I believe like in every one of these states, all of the marijuana you buy,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  whether it's a medical thing or a recreational thing has to be grown in the state because you
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.240]  can't legally take it over state lines. Even if you're going from like one state where it's legal
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:23.760]  to another, it's all kind of bananas, but you know, it falls on this spectrum of is this beneath
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:31.200]  us or our brand or not. And the gambling stuff was truly illegal everywhere but Nevada. Sports
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.880]  gambling has been illegal everywhere but Nevada until just a handful of years ago. But then once
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.800]  the dam breaks, it breaks everywhere because it's all of a sudden when Pennsylvania sees that
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.720]  Delaware is getting all of this tax money from- The tax money, absolutely.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:53.680]  Right. And it, you know, every single way that gambling has grown since I was a kid. I mean,
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:59.040]  it was a, I remember being like six years old or so when Atlantic City started opened their
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.120]  casinos and seemed terribly exciting to me. You know, it was like, it seemed, wow, this is,
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:08.960]  you know, gambling looks like a lot of fun. It was a huge deal because it was the first place
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:13.280]  where there was any gambling outside of Nevada, except horse racing, which has always been
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.320]  oddly legal everywhere, even though you're allowed to bet on the horses. But then, you know, like the
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.720]  horse tracks around here, state by state started adding slot machines. And once one state did it
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.040]  and they saw how much money was coming in and how people stopped going to Philadelphia Park
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.960]  to watch horse tracks, they'd go to Delaware because then they could play slot machines.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.560]  Well, guess what? They added slot machines in Philadelphia. So anyway-
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.480]  So that's interesting to me, though, because you're a little older than I am. And so in my
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.920]  mind, it was always Vegas and Atlantic City. And that was it. There was nothing else. And then,
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.600]  yeah, in the past, I don't know, 20 years or so is where, as you said, the dam broke and all
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.640]  these states started allowing all sorts of gambling. But that's funny that for you,
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:57.440]  it was just Nevada. And for me, it was just Nevada and Atlantic City. And then, and now,
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.960]  you know, anyone born in the past 30 years, it's just everywhere.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.200]  Right. Well, and then in the in-between time when they legalized it, there were a couple of,
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:12.240]  for whatever, I guess, some kind of exception to federal laws where Indian reservations were-
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.680]  Could have, could have gambling.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:19.040]  And then did build them. And they're a huge, huge deal on the, as we call it,
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.720]  the Northeast Corridor between Foxwoods up by you-
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.760]  Foxwoods, Mohegan Sun.
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.200]  Mohegan Sun in between New York and Boston in particular. There's some Indian land and
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.680]  they built these casinos that were untapped because people
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.440]  no longer had to drive all the way to Atlantic City, which, you know, for Boston, you know,
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.960]  that's quite a trek.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.760]  Well, you might as well just fly, at that point, you might as well fly to Vegas,
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.640]  right? Which is, you know, how trouble starts. But anyway, the whole Apple pregame show was
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:55.200]  sponsored by BetMGM, which is, I actually have an account at BetMGM. I pass no judgment. I enjoy
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.080]  sports gambling. Somehow they've managed, even though it's like state by state, that the MGM
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.480]  thing is tied into the MGM resorts. So, like, I can use my same account that I have from actual
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.040]  casinos in Las Vegas. It's the same MGM account. It's a pretty good sports app, you know, for
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:18.000]  betting on football and baseball and stuff. But, you know, am I surprised that Apple took them on
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.160]  as a sponsor? A little bit, you know?
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.040]  Yeah, it definitely, you know, we said it earlier, but if Apple had done this and shown no ads or
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.800]  only ads for Apple stuff, I would not have been at all surprised by that.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:29.840]  Right.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.960]  You know, it would have been different. It would have been unusual, but I would have said,
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.760]  well, that's why it's on this premium, you know, network or whatever we want to call it, premium
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.240]  service. And they want to show off their technology. They want to show off their subscription
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.000]  services, and they don't need to share it with anybody else. They certainly don't need the money
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.760]  from this. Early on, we were saying, how much money would they be leaving on the table? Whatever
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.840]  it is, they don't need it, you know, with hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank. They could
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.600]  take this as a loss leader and just say, yep, we're presenting baseball, and there's not going
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.600]  to be a lot of ads, and it's going to be a much more enjoyable experience. And the same way that,
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.520]  you know, when they show a movie on Apple TV+, you're not getting ads in the middle of that.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.640]  Right, right.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.480]  They're not going that route so far, at least. I'll be interested to see when it is no longer
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:16.960]  free. So the first half of the season is free to anybody. You don't need a subscription to tune in.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.560]  And the second half is when they're going to say, okay, you need an Apple TV Plus subscription.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.320]  I wonder if it'll be any different at that point.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.800]  Have they officially announced that? I thought so.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.320]  I think they've left that open. I think what they've said is here's the schedule for the first
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:39.440]  half. And the first half of the season, here's the whole schedule. And all of these games will
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.400]  be available free for anybody who wants to watch. And they have an instruction page so that you can
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.360]  figure out how to watch. Like even if you're on a Windows computer, you can go to tv.apple.com,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.480]  and they'll, and you don't have an Apple ID yet. But you just, you got to watch the California
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.640]  Angels or the Anaheim Angels. What do they call it now? Los Angeles Angels?
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.280]  Los, are they still the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim?
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.040]  Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. But you know, if your favorite team is on and this is the
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.480]  thing that's going to get you into TV, you could do it without, even without owning an Apple
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.080]  product. But they'll, you know, but I don't think they've said that you'll have to pay for the
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.920]  second half. I think it's just, they just haven't answered the question. And I think people are
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:20.720]  assuming. So they've, all they've said is that the first half is free. And now we're getting,
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.600]  we're, we're leaping to the conclusion that the second half won't be.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:30.000]  And that is a very Apple-like strategy of we just won't, you know, don't, don't say, let's see,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.080]  let's see. And we'll make up our mind later. Right. I mean, they didn't even announce WWDC
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:39.600]  until like three days ago. Right. It's, you know, they, why do they always announce WWDC
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:45.840]  so bizarrely late compared, compared to every other developer conference from a comparable company.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.760]  Which the year before tells you when it's going to be.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.720]  Right. Every, you know, like at Macworld, you'd be leaving Macworld Expo and they'd be,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:58.320]  they, you could not leave without three different people giving you a signup sheet for next year's
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.680]  Macworld Expo, which will be January. On these specific dates.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:06.960]  Right. These dates here at Moscone and San Francisco, blah, blah, blah. You know, Java
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.960]  world, whatever. I don't even know what the hell else. Oracle world. I don't know. I guess that's
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.120]  the same as Java world now, but Salesforce, Salesforce has a big conference every year.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.960]  You know, they, they, they probably have the dates for three years of them out, out in advance.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:23.440]  All right. Well, so I'm, I'm looking at this at the PR and it says, and for a limited time without
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.680]  the need for a subscription. Yeah. So the app that's the Apple press release. So they're
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.720]  definitely implying, but you know, a limited time could be, who knows how long we've all got a
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:37.440]  limited time on this earth. Right. Well, and, and like I said, presumably my guess is that the
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:44.320]  number one reason Apple is even getting into this at all is just to, just to sort of increase the
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.000]  surface area of the number of people who would subscribe to TV plus. I mean, ultimately I think
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.760]  they want people to subscribe to TV plus. And if the most interesting thing to a certain
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.000]  demographic is Friday night baseball, well then they're not going to keep it free forever.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.760]  Right. It's I, you know, it's the same way, you know, and they have, you know, they're,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:07.280]  they're expanding the type of shows they have, you know, like now they have a talk show with
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.560]  Jon Stewart and. You know, they didn't make that free just to get the Jon Stewart fans who might
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:17.120]  be, you know, I would presume, you know, they, they marginally increase the number of people
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:21.920]  who might be interested. There might be a ton of people out there who do not like watching
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:28.320]  prestige drama TV, like the morning show and severance and, you know, all the other
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.800]  shows that typical Apple TV plus shows. They don't like stuff like that, but they love Jon
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.920]  Stewart. Right. Well, then, you know, that now they box a month and you can see it. Right.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.440]  And you get all this other stuff and you might like some of it. I, so I presume that you're
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:48.800]  right. I would guess that the second half of the season will be, you require a paid account or,
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.640]  you know, maybe they'll have a deal where you can still get a 30 day free signup. I don't know,
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.800]  they'll do something, but, but that's in there. I am a little surprised about the advertising now,
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:04.800]  because it, it, one of my favorite little details is the, the, the family and I, as you know,
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:10.080]  have on occasion, we go on, we've been on the cruise vacations and we've been on the
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.800]  Royal Caribbean cruises, which are a very traditional. It's exactly what you think.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.720]  If you've never been on a cruise, Royal Caribbean cruise is exactly what you think a cruise is like.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.040]  Everyone gets sick is what you're telling me. No, nobody gets sick.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.000]  Cause that's what, I've never been on a cruise. And I assume that as soon as you get on,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.080]  you get norovirus, if you're lucky. And if you're unlucky, you get COVID.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:36.400]  I, I have never, never gotten ill on a, on a cruise ship. I will say this, it's a total aside,
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.160]  but I, I've never gotten sick by going to a conference. I know people used to say they'd
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.880]  go to Mac world and come home and everybody always got like some kind of Mac world flu because of
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.760]  people coming together. I, and it's not like I have a particularly hardy, never get a cold or
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.160]  flu immune system, but I'd never came home from a conference. All the times I've been to like
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.120]  WWDC or Mac world or any of those things, I never came back and, and got sick, but maybe it's
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.640]  but maybe it's just stupid luck. Maybe because I, unlike my gags on previous years on this show,
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:11.600]  I actually do wash my hands when I'm in public as often. And, you know, you know, let's, let's be
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.840]  double sure here. I don't know what you're supposed to, you know, what are you supposed
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.600]  to sing happy birthday or something like that? It's like 20 seconds. The watch does it for you
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:25.600]  now. I don't like that. I get too many false positives. It's too stupid. It's a nice idea.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  And, you know, but it doesn't work for me, but we've been on the Disney cruises and it's a lot
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.520]  of fun. And even when our son got older and it wasn't, you know, it's really, really, I would
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.440]  recommend it to anybody with little kids who are into Disney. It's a terrific family place where
[01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.080]  the adults can, you know, get some time away from the kids and the kids can go to a supervised
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.240]  thing that they will love, you know, and they won't feel like they'll be begging to go to
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.400]  the kids club or whatever they call it. They want to get away from you when they're young.
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.080]  But we've been, it's a nice cruise and it's a nice vacation and a nice way to see different
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.120]  islands in the Caribbean. But the most distinctive thing, at least from my mind as a degenerate
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:07.200]  gambler of Disney cruises versus every other cruise line in the world is they don't have
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:13.200]  casinos on the ships. And the casinos on all the cruise ships operate once they're in international
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:18.560]  waters so that there's, well, and it's for tax purposes and regular tours, you know, like,
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:26.400]  so gambling is, casino gambling is illegal in Bermuda. And we've gone on this couple of cruises
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:32.640]  to Bermuda with our extended families, parents and my sister and her family and stuff like that.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:38.080]  But Bermuda, there are no casinos on the land in Bermuda. So once the ship is docked,
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:42.880]  the casino has to close anyway. But I think they close, even if they land at an island where there
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.800]  are casinos, they still close the casinos on the ship because they don't want to pay taxes to the
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.920]  to the country where they're docked. And I think the logic behind why does every cruise ship have
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:59.120]  a casino is why not, right? Right? That's a terrible answer, but it also makes perfect
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.160]  sense. Yes. Right. But Disney does not. They do have no casinos on their ships, even though
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.000]  there's no legal reason. And again, like Apple, nobody from Disney is going to come out and
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.200]  explain that we think gambling is a filthy vice and we don't want to be associated with it.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.400]  But, you know, Disney's got a funny brand, you know? Well, it's exactly like the Intel
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.040]  Inside stickers until a year and a half ago, two years ago. But, you know, when Apple switched
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.880]  Intel and they were asked, you know, are you going to put the Intel Inside sticker on there
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:32.400]  and collect whatever dollar you get for every machine you sell? And Apple certainly didn't do
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.240]  that because it wasn't their brand to do that. Well, you remember, though, that that's one of
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.840]  my all time favorite moments of my career. I was in... Were you out at the press conference? I was
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:48.480]  at the press conference for... I forget. It was a weird... I forget why, though. It was at Apple's
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:55.440]  Town Hall, which was famously small, very cozy at the old Infinite Loop campus. I forget what the...
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.880]  if it was in Tennegate and they just happened to take questions on other subjects. Would that have...
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.320]  No, because that would have been too early. No, it's too late. It's got to be earlier than that.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.800]  Were they introducing a new machine, one of the first Intel machines or something? I don't know.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:12.400]  I don't know what... I'd have to look... I'll have to put it in the show notes and look it up. But
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:18.320]  it was after... as they were want to do at the time, which was wonderful, but also makes me feel
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:25.280]  ancient. Because imagine if Apple did this now, if they came to the end of an event and then they
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.440]  said... Q&A? Yeah, and they said, hey, we're going to do... take some questions from the media and
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.160]  take a minute, set up some stools, get some water for whoever's going to... you know, Tim Cook and
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:38.880]  Jaws and Federighi, whoever else is going to answer some questions, and then just take 10
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:44.640]  minutes of questions from the press right there on stage. I would love it. I thought it was great.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:51.680]  But anyway, the guy asked about the Intel stickers and everybody laughed in the audience. It was...
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.800]  and I forget the guy who asked it, but he was more... I remember looking him up and, you know,
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.880]  it was a legit question from his perspective. He wasn't like... Right, it's a business question
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.760]  as opposed to, you know, an Apple... someone who covers Apple thinking about this. Yeah, it was
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:10.080]  like the equivalent... I don't think he was. You know, maybe he was from PC Magazine or Tom's
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.480]  Hardware, but somebody who at the time covered the whole spectrum of the technology industry.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:20.000]  But everybody in the hall laughed and giggled a little, but Jobs had the perfect answer. He said,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:27.280]  we like our own stickers, which was a great answer because it was funny. It made him feel...
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.640]  it made him feel better for asking. He got a clever answer because of his question. It deflated
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:37.040]  the fact that some of us in the audience had chuckled at his question. You know, it made the
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:42.160]  whole thing funny. It leavened it up. But he also didn't throw Intel under the bus, their new partner
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:47.920]  who they'd just done it. It was absolutely perfect. Steve Jobs at his best. But anyway, Disney
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.240]  doesn't do casinos. And I wondered, would Apple not do gambling? Well, no, they do gambling. Now,
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.160]  of course, they have the gambling apps in the App Store, right? But that's different. You know,
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:04.160]  they have all sorts of stuff in the App Store that they may not take ads for. But yeah,
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.120]  gambling is just... sports gambling has just sort of rocketed from completely,
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.280]  literally illegal to just perfectly as acceptable as selling beer, you know, within the course of
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:22.640]  like a year. Strange times. Well, and you're right, it is within the past. Is it a year?
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.120]  It's a year or two. And it certainly coincides with a whole lot of people just sitting in their
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.280]  homes and not having anything else to do. Yeah, yeah. Well, there's a lot of speculation that
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.080]  that's been bad. It's been bad timing, you know, that it's actually been sort of a bad time for
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:40.480]  sports gambling to sort of get legalized nationwide because people have time on their hands.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:46.480]  Really? Yeah, but I... Oh, and they're doing other things than that? I think that's overblown. I
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:51.600]  think people who have gambling problems, it's a bad idea in general. And it's, you know, it's
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.680]  and it's certainly for people who have any kind of, you know, if you have an alcohol addiction
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:03.760]  problem, it probably was good when alcohol was prohibited. It's just that it wasn't, you know...
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.760]  Making it harder, at least. Yeah. Right. For people who have a gambling addiction,
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:13.200]  it can't be good that it's legal in any way, anywhere, at any time, let alone making it so
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.320]  that you can do it from your phone anytime you're within state... A couple taps, yeah.
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:24.000]  State borders? Yeah, it's probably bad, but that's, you know, that's a discussion for another show.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.560]  Let's talk about Audio Hijack 4. I would say it's safe to say that Audio Hijack is
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:34.080]  Rogue Amoeba's flagship app. That's the term I've always used because we've had other products that
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:40.080]  have been more popular in terms of users or revenue over time, but Audio Hijack we've had for
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.800]  almost 20 years now, and it has been consistently popular for that 20 years and more and more
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.600]  popular in recent years. That's a... Flagship is the term that I always use. Yeah, but that's,
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:55.680]  you know, that's sort of fascinating, and I know there are certainly other Mac apps. The Mac is an
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.000]  established platform, let's say. You know, there are certainly a lot of apps that are older than
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.240]  20 years. There's the BB edits and... BB edit is the obvious one that comes to mind, yeah.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:09.760]  Photoshop and Illustrator and, you know, the list goes... Graphic Converter, if you want to go
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.960]  it purely indie. I think my beloved Keyboard Maestro, it was in different hands at the time,
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.600]  but I believe it... I think Keyboard Maestro goes back to classic Mac OS. I'm pretty sure,
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.120]  yeah. You know, but 20 years, it's a long time, but it's just kind of fascinating that something
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:31.120]  that was a good enough idea 20 years ago and then well-executed enough that, you know, it could
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:37.680]  become the flagship app of an indie software company like Rogue Amoeba is more popular now,
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:41.920]  right? Because the world has changed, right? It's, you know, there's all sorts of ideas that
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.080]  might have been great 20 years ago that aren't great anymore, and you can't predict that. And
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.400]  if you, you know, tried to predict right now what's a great new app to make, but I want to
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:58.400]  make sure this thing is more popular than ever in the year 2042. I want it to be more popular than
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:03.520]  now. Good luck. You know, that's just good luck, don't you think? I mean, you know, it's...
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:09.200]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, the biggest thing for us... So Audio Hijack, when we first created it,
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:15.120]  was designed to... The example I always use is record real player streams because it really
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:19.040]  dates me and makes me sound old and makes the product sound old because real player streams
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.800]  don't even exist anymore. And, you know, it predates podcasts. So it's something where
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:32.080]  the initial idea is not something that it's used for ever at this point, but the general idea of
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:37.040]  recording audio is something we've been doing for decades. And the biggest stroke of fortune that
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:43.600]  we had was the rise of things exactly like this, podcasts, because there aren't that many people
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:47.760]  making podcasts compared to people listening to podcasts. So something like Overcast, where,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:52.640]  you know, you're listening to podcasts, that has a much wider audience. But people that are making
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:57.600]  podcasts like you are making money from making podcasts, a whole lot of them, selling ads,
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.640]  having subscriptions, and making a tool that helps them do that is something where there actually is
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.200]  a market for it. And as podcasts have become so mainstream, it's been... That's the number one
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.440]  reason why it's more popular now than it was 20 years ago is because there's this new thing that
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:18.160]  didn't even exist until 2006, 2005, you know, a few years into the product.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.360]  I know we've talked about Audio Hijack before, but I don't assume that everybody listening has
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.600]  keenly remembered your March 2019 appearance on the show when we might last have spoken about it.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:36.240]  But I'm going to take a stab at describing for people who aren't familiar with Audio Hijack,
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:42.560]  but it's a utility for the Mac and only the Mac. It is not for iOS, and it is not available on
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:50.240]  Windows or Linux or TiVo, or I don't know where else it could run. But it's a Mac utility,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:55.040]  and you install it, and then you can assign sources, which could be something you think,
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.960]  obviously, a microphone, duh, but you could just assign application as an input source and say,
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:08.480]  I would like to record the audio from Safari and whatever Safari is playing, like if it were
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:16.160]  a real player stream or something else that through whatever JavaScript chicanery they've
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:23.200]  tried to keep you from just being able to download and listen not live, like you should be able to do
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.880]  with a computer, you could just pump that in as an input stream and then do all sorts of stuff.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:35.840]  To do all sorts of stuff here is where I'm skipping. Keeping it simple. It's a lot of dot,
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.920]  dot, dot. It's like the equivalent of saying with BB Edit, you can do stuff to the text
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:45.680]  and then output it to audio that you can save as a file on your computer.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:51.520]  Yeah, I mean, so the three-word summary of the app is record any audio, and that's served us
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:55.840]  pretty well, but as you said, there's a whole lot of depth in terms of things that you can do
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.760]  beyond just making a recording and a whole lot of reasons why you would make a recording.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:04.400]  Right, but the big difference I see as we look at this 20-year mark is, you know,
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.920]  we're joking about RealPlayer, but it is true. We've got listeners who don't remember RealPlayer.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.080]  Oh, I'm sure. I wish I didn't.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:16.160]  One of Jonas' high school friends is a listener of the show. It just blows me away because I
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.080]  just assumed that, come on, I don't know. I'd like to think I'm not too middle-aged,
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.240]  but it's like I kind of worry that I've lost the idea that I'm going to get the teens.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:32.480]  But some computer-enthusiast teens who listen not because that's their pal's dad, but just
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.800]  like stumbled upon the show. Somebody like that, they don't remember RealPlayer. You know,
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.360]  it was kind of bananas. RealPlayer was what, Flash? Was it Flash or was it their own? It was
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.080]  like their own—
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.280]  I think it was their own.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:43.600]  Yeah.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.040]  It was garbage is what it was.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.520]  It was very bad, but it was the option for streaming audio at the time. Besides,
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.360]  I don't even know which came first, but there was also Windows Media Audio.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:53.840]  Right.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.760]  Which also isn't in use anymore.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.400]  Right, and QuickTime Audio. But the idea back in those days was that
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:06.480]  browser—web browser plugins, fundamentally, hugely different from today's extensions,
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.280]  where today's extensions for browsers are all built using web technology. The extensions
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.880]  themselves are programmed in JavaScript, and if they have a presentation layer, it's, you know,
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:21.600]  HTML and CSS, whereas plugins were like binaries. They were—
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:24.240]  It was like running a separate application just inside the web browser.
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:29.040]  Just inside the web browser. And, you know, RealPlayer was one of them, and it was
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:33.920]  it was a thing, and they were ahead of their time in terms of anticipating the market of
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.640]  people would love to listen to audio. I mean, you could listen—
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.640]  To stream audio from concerts and—
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.880]  Ball games? I remember listening to baseball games. But, you know, the internet at the
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.480]  time was a little bit slower.
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:46.400]  Just a little bit.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:50.640]  So they were like, I don't know, like 64 kilobits per second, probably less, probably,
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:56.720]  like, I don't know, super staticky. It was like listening to Ham Radio in 1988.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:01.200]  It was very low quality, but it was stuff you couldn't listen to otherwise, you know?
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.160]  Any other way, absolutely.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:07.680]  Right. And radio stations would have like a little, you know, they'd say like, go to
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.320]  our website and you can listen to our RealPlayer stream. And if you wanted to listen to your
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.040]  hometown radio station in Philadelphia while you were in San Francisco, you could do it
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.360]  over the internet. That seemed amazing.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.160]  It was amazing. And yeah, I mean, we're denigrating RealPlayer. It wasn't that bad. It was not
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:29.760]  great technology, but what it enabled was very cool. And yeah, it certainly was, as
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:34.080]  you said, I think, it was ahead of its time because it's sort of, I always think of this
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.480]  about the Newton, you know, the network wasn't really ready for what they were doing in both
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:39.280]  of those cases.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.680]  Oh, absolutely. Oh, I think so too. I've always said that. To me, the biggest problem with
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.400]  the Newton and even the Palm Pilot, you know, like the Newton had two—
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:46.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:52.720]  The Newton was too big, too expensive, and there was no wireless network. So it was
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:57.920]  there was no wireless networking. The Wi-Fi didn't even exist yet. So the Palm Pilot
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.360]  solved two of the problems. It was a much more reasonable size. You could definitely
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:06.240]  carry it in a pocket, and it was cheaper. It was like 400 bucks instead of 1,000. So
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:11.760]  there's one reason why Palm was successful. Palm Pilot was successful and Newton wasn't.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.880]  But ultimately, the Palm Pilot kind of fizzled out because it didn't have wireless networking
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:21.280]  either. And really, the whole point of carrying a pocket computer around, we've now realized
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.880]  is to be on the internet.
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:28.720]  Get on the internet. But that 20 years ago, let's make a record audio anywhere Mac utility,
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:35.920]  the idea primarily was let's record audio from known sources out there, you know?
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.760]  Yeah, that was certainly like one of the biggest uses. Another one that was that's sort of
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:45.280]  funny was adding an equalizer to like DVDs. So a DVD player on the Mac didn't have an
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:49.440]  EQ. And people were watching movies and they said, I want to I want to tweak the audio
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.440]  on this. And so, yeah, basically the original use cases, if I looked back at like our original
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:58.720]  press release, I could probably tick off all the original use cases and say, yep, no one's
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:02.400]  doing that anymore. No one's doing that anymore, which so yeah, we're definitely a little
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:07.040]  bit fortunate to have found new ways to angle this and to focus on.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.480]  Yeah, but that is a good point, though, that Audio Hijack doesn't just save to a file.
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:15.680]  You can just pipe it through live and apply filters and just have it come through.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.480]  Well, just listen to it live, but have it filtered or pumped through Audio Hijack for
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.200]  some kind of processing type thing, or have it saved to a file at the same time or something.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:29.040]  Yeah, but you could listen to it. The big difference, like you said, clearly now,
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:36.560]  especially greatly. I'm not even going to say exacerbated by COVID, but accelerated
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:42.080]  by COVID, because I think the move to more people working at home was already underway
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.640]  and COVID just— Oh, but definitely accelerated. I mean, from zero to 100.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:51.120]  But I don't think it's going to go back, right? Like, I think even as people now,
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:56.160]  literally as we speak, are returning to offices and stuff like that, like the need and acceptance
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:02.320]  for—well, Paul always works from home Thursdays and Fridays anyway, so any kind of meeting
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.920]  on Thursday or Friday, you're going to jump on. The meeting is going to be on Zoom or
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:10.560]  whatever anyway, even if some of the people are in an office together. It's just way
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.960]  more accepted and accelerated, and I think we would have gotten—where we'll wind up
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:23.280]  when, you know, knock on wood, COVID is in the wide rearview mirror overall, is where
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.120]  we would have wound up anyway. It's just going to happen many, many years faster. But
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:32.320]  long story short, people are making their own audio now and have things they want to
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.120]  do and filter and make sound better about it.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:42.640]  Yeah, I mean, so I mentioned podcasts, even before that, having the iPod. The iPod debuted
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:47.280]  in 2001, and a year later is when we first released Audio Hijack, and people were recording
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:52.080]  stuff to put on their iPod. So, you know, prior to that, you had a portable disc player,
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.160]  CD player, disc man, you had a Walkman tape player, but you didn't really have a computer
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:01.200]  based device. So the iPod was the first big thing for us. Podcasting was the second big
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:05.120]  thing for us. And in terms of Audio Hijack, at least, yeah, having people working from
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:12.400]  home. In March of 2020, even before the pandemic had affected me personally, you know, before
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.800]  stores were shutting down or businesses were shutting down temporarily, we saw a sales
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:22.320]  spike, and we honestly did not know what was happening. We saw such an extreme sales spike
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.720]  of Audio Hijack and another one of our tools, Loopback, which lets you route audio around
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:32.800]  your computer. And it took us a little while talking to users who contacted us and said,
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.480]  oh, I'm trying to do whatever. It took us a little while to understand, oh, all of these
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:41.760]  people are suddenly working remotely, and these tools are helping them do that. And
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.400]  it was really, it was a very strange thing initially to just see this huge sales spike
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.920]  totally unrelated to, you know, we just released Audio Hijack 4. We see a sales spike based
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.240]  on that because people are talking about it, people are linking to it. That's great. But
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.360]  to see a sales spike come out of nowhere was very odd. And then to realize that it was
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.400]  associated with this horrible event that was affecting everything was, it's still difficult
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.240]  to, I've yet to figure out how to talk about this, because obviously it's nice to make
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.920]  more money, but it's not nice for it to be on the backs of literally hundreds of thousands,
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:18.960]  millions of people dying and businesses going out of business because they can't sustain
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.560]  themselves. And, you know, it's not nice for it to be on the back of a global pandemic.
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.640]  So I'd rather have made less money and not had the global pandemic, but, you know, it
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:31.040]  was really nice to be able to help a whole lot of people with these products to do things
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:35.120]  that they suddenly needed to do and that they didn't realize they would need to do.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.800]  It was very gratifying. It's a small thing, obviously. We didn't create the vaccines
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.160]  that are saving people's lives, but making it more possible for people to work from home
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:47.360]  and therefore not have to go out and therefore not spread the virus was a small contribution
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.720]  to make things a little bit better, at least.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.800]  Yeah. What is the saying, fortune benefits the prepared or?
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.200]  Well, fortune favors the bold is one of them, but I don't even know if this was bold. This
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.400]  was more luck, like you said.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.840]  Yeah. But yeah, it's funny. It's, you know, there's for as many businesses that suffered
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.480]  terribly, you know, during the, especially 2020 in the pandemic, you know, there were
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:13.520]  others that did well, you know, and it's funny to think of like you guys being there with
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.840]  like people who sell yeast to bake your own bread at home.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.720]  Right.
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:24.400]  Right. And it's like, it's like if you have a small company with seven employees and all
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:31.040]  you do is sell stuff to help people make better bread at home, it was like the best, probably
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.280]  the best thing that ever happened to your business and all of a sudden you can't keep
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:36.240]  the stuff in stock.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:40.080]  That was the thing. Yeah. I mean, you're mentioning a particular case where, what is it? King
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:45.760]  Arthur Flour is a small company and they suddenly needed a hundred times as much capacity as
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.760]  they had. And they were selling like only 40 pound bags of flour because that's all they
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.200]  could manage, even though most people wanted five or 10 pounds, whatever. We had a similar
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.080]  issue where we had this sales spike and we had a usage spike and we fortunately were
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:03.040]  able to bring on an experienced support technician who previously had worked at the Omni group.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:07.040]  An old friend of ours named Brian Covey was able to come in and work for a few months
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:13.120]  to do support for us. It was something where we suddenly had this spike in support cases
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.520]  just from having so many more users. And it's difficult to plan for that. It's certainly,
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.280]  you don't want to have that capacity all the time on the off chance that you'll suddenly
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:28.240]  have a huge usage spike and all sorts of businesses. It's a good problem to have, obviously,
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.080]  but it is still a problem you have to solve to figure out how to deal with suddenly having
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.240]  twice as many or five times as many or 10 times as many people using your product or
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.680]  purchasing your product or whatever.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:42.320]  In some ways, I know I'm entering into Ben Thompson territory here by bringing up marginal
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:48.640]  costs, but it is sort of the magic of software is that there's no marginal costs. So it's
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:56.080]  a lot lower, at least. Well, you do pay more for some things as sales go up, but it's all
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.000]  commensurate as opposed to you don't want to be Peloton, right? Peloton saw this huge
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:08.160]  spike in people buying their bikes and treadmills. And because they couldn't go to the gym and
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:15.040]  Peloton thought it was a flash forwarding to the future, the acceleration of a trend
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.840]  and Peloton thought the whole world is going to stop going to the gym anyway, because riding
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:26.800]  your beautiful Peloton at home is so much better. So let's build a $600 million factory
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:31.040]  here in the United States. Let's buy this, get as many of these bikes made. And then
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:37.360]  it turned out that, no, it was a one-time spike from the one-time pandemic. And then
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.840]  they have all these bikes on their hands and a factory that they'd broken ground on that
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:47.920]  they actually don't need. And it's a mess. You make a guess, you go with it. And we can
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.600]  laugh at their plight, but I sort of admire the fact that they were true believers in
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.200]  the product. They went for it, absolutely. And thought that this isn't just a one-time
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:58.480]  spike. This is going to open the doors and now everybody's going to buy a Peloton. You
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:05.120]  don't have to print up. It's not 30 years ago where you're printing CDs. No, no. So
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:10.160]  yeah, to your point, I don't even know the numbers, but let's just say three times as
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:14.800]  many people downloaded the software. We didn't notice that. The one thing we noticed was
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:20.000]  support requests, just because if one in a hundred people need support, and if there's
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.320]  suddenly three times as many people, then you have more support requests. So that was
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.920]  for us the sort of growing pain. But yeah, it was very easy to deal with most of it.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.440]  And a lot of it just didn't get noticed at all, things like downloads.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.920]  Yeah. Let's take a break here and thank our next sponsor. I'm very, very excited. First
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.200]  time sponsor and they're celebrating a special anniversary. It's Get Drafts. That's
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.400]  Drafts the app from Agile Tortoise.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.600]  Oh, is that their 10th anniversary? Do I have that right?
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  That is correct. It is the 10th anniversary of the productivity app Drafts. I'll just
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.400]  tell you the URL right now. It's getdrafts.com. They're running a discount offer. Look,
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.760]  I could tell you in two words, Drafts is a notes app, but Drafts is so much more than
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.760]  a notes app. And trust me, I know notes apps. Drafts and Drafts is very different than the
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.840]  notes app I made, but that's what makes it so interesting. It is a very different approach
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:21.040]  to using your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch. It is very, very much an Apple ecosystem
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:26.560]  app. If there were a sensible reason to have Drafts on tvOS, I guarantee you they would
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:32.640]  have it. But there's not, so there is. But your watch, iOS, and Mac, definitely. It's
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:38.320]  a low friction way to capture your thoughts. By default, Drafts launches ready to type.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.880]  So as soon as you launch Drafts by default, it's just ready there with a new note. So
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.480]  just something you want to dash down, just a couple of words, a thought, something to
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:52.080]  buy, whatever, and you don't want to lose it. Open Drafts, start typing, put the phone
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:57.280]  back in your pocket or your purse or wherever, and there it is, a new draft ready for you.
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.720]  No more fumbling around to find the right app or find the folder where you want to put
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:04.720]  it. You just make the new thing, and then you can deal with it later, and you can tag
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:09.360]  it later or something like that, or process it. Once you've created your text, their
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.880]  customizable editor, which has terrific, by the way, I will say markdown support, syntax
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:19.600]  coloring, all sorts of keyboard shortcuts that are totally customizable for adding
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.240]  markdown links or italics or something like that. This is not one of those things where
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:29.360]  it's like here's how Drafts works, and then they realize markdown got popular and
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:35.840]  sort of tacked it on. This was sort of as close to built with markdown in mind as I
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.840]  could imagine. And if you don't use markdown, you don't have to. It's not like everything
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:43.440]  is marked down. There are all sorts of different types that notes can be, but if you do use
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.480]  markdown, man, it is a terrific app for that. You could just do all sorts of things. They
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:52.720]  have so many actions. You get actions for sending emails, for sending messages, for
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:57.840]  tweeting right from Drafts. You can create lists in the Reminders app, the system-level
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:02.480]  Reminders app right from your Drafts based on the content of the Drafts, and you can
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:08.320]  extend Drafts with ready-to-use actions from the Drafts directory on the website where
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.640]  you just say, oh, I need something to do that, like integration with WordPress or something
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.440]  like that. Download the action right from the website. It opens right in Drafts on your
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.800]  device. It'll sync to your other devices over iCloud so that the same extensions you
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:29.520]  have on one device work elsewhere. And you could just build your own, and it's terrifically
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:34.960]  well-documented, just a terrific user manual. The scripting interface for creating your
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:43.840]  own extensions is absolutely perfectly documented. I use it all the time. I don't write tons
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.360]  of my own extensions and stuff for Drafts or modify the ones that are there, but then
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.960]  when I want to, it's like anything I want to look up, it's right there. It tells me
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.720]  how to do it. Oh, easy change. Do that. Boom. Done. April 2022, this month, marks the 10th
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:01.440]  anniversary of the Drafts original release in the App Store, and a celebrated agile
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:09.840]  tortoise is offering new users a full year of Drafts Pro for just $4.99. $4.99. That
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.240]  is an unbelievable deal. Act fast. It is only good through the end of April. That's why
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.800]  I wanted to make sure they got into this first episode of April here. Let this offer have
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.760]  it rattling around in your head for as long as possible because you don't want to miss
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:29.520]  out on it. Just one penny under five bucks and you get a full year of Drafts Pro. You
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:36.800]  can start using Drafts completely free of charge. Go to getdrafts.com slash the talk
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:46.480]  show, getdrafts.com slash the talk show. Automation support, shortcuts, scripting, downloadable
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.600]  actions that you don't have to write or modify at all, themes, syntax definitions, all that
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:59.120]  stuff. It's so, so great. It's just a terrific, terrific software. Exemplifies terrific Apple
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:04.000]  platform software. So my thanks to Drafts, getdrafts.com slash the talk show. Now, that's
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.480]  a perfect segue back to you, Paul, talking about Audio Hijack 4, because one of the most
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.760]  intriguing new features to me is the new, what are you calling it? Scripting automation.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.880]  It's a little bit of both. Yeah.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:26.720]  It's such a wonderful similarities to Drafts and being well-documented and it's supported
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.000]  right within the app itself. So it's not that there's anything wrong with just saying,
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.920]  oh, there's a folder and you put your scripts in the folder and then they show up in this
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.040]  menu. That's a good way if you just want to like populate a menu of scripts in a scriptable
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.960]  app. But it's like the actions in Audio Hijack, they're just like the actions that are built
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:54.880]  into the app. And you guys added, so a whole scripting interface is new in Audio Hijack.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:01.040]  And also like Drafts, it's using JavaScript. And I'm just curious, I'm curious what the
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:07.360]  thinking was there. It's a custom, not custom, but it's not based on the JavaScript for
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:14.400]  automation that's related to AppleScript. No. So, I mean, you are someone who,
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.480]  did you ever really write in AppleScript? Yes, I have written, I have probably written
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.200]  as much AppleScript as anybody who's never been paid to write AppleScript.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.200]  Okay. Okay. So, I mean, so you're familiar with AppleScript, obviously, as am I, but
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.600]  then, you know, you certainly know, and I think probably a lot of listeners know,
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.360]  Apple doesn't seem to care about AppleScript and hasn't seemed to care about AppleScript for,
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:42.480]  for, geez, at least five years, if not longer. So Audio Hijack, is that an understatement?
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.560]  That might be the funniest thing any guest on this show has ever said.
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:51.280]  It's a little bit of an understatement. I would say it's an understatement. I would
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:59.200]  say that AppleScript has existed in the weirdest, no, no man's land in Apple technologies. I forget
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:02.640]  who was on recently. I don't want to interrupt you because I want you to go back to the thinking
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:07.120]  behind. But I will just say this, on a recent show, I remember saying with somebody, if you
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:15.040]  went back to 1994, 1995, I think AppleScript came out in 1993. Two years in, a lot of apps adopted
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:20.560]  it. The need for sort of inter-application scripting was out, but by 1995, people sort of,
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:25.440]  people who were into it and Mac users sort of had the, you know, we, we could see what AppleScript
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.680]  was going to be and it's like, what was good about it and what was bad about it.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:36.640]  If you looked around, like by 1996, when the Apple announced the deal with Next and they said,
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.920]  we're buying this company to have, you know, use their operating system as the future of
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:49.360]  the Mac and Apple technology. If you looked around at what technologies were in macOS at the time
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:57.600]  and said, what do you think will still be here in 20 plus years, 25 years. I don't know where
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.000]  AppleScript would have been on the list, but I'll tell you, it would be very, very close to the
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.240]  bottom. In my opinion, both, not because I ha I don't hate it. I use it. I like it, but it was
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:14.400]  weird. It certainly seemed, it did not seem like it was long for the world then. And when it was
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:22.320]  three years old and yet here we are, and it might be the only thing left from Mac OS. It's, it's a
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:29.440]  very strange, no person's land where it is, where it's, it's too essential to too many pro users
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:35.680]  workflows to just get rid of. But yet they've, like you, I mean, you said five years, but they
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:44.560]  just haven't really had great enthusiasm for it at any point in the post next reunification era.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.840]  There's never been a time where Apple is really, really gung ho about AppleScript since Steve Jobs
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.960]  and Next came back to the company, but yet they never took it away. Well, like you said, it was,
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:00.240]  it had grown so essential for so many things that most users don't ever notice it. Right. And then
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:06.000]  the pro users who have these workflows that rely on, on AppleScripting don't want it to go away.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.880]  So that, that explains why it never went away. But the, the thing that, you know, I think a lot
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:15.840]  of people were frustrated by is just that it was never updated. It was never improved. It was never,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.400]  it never got any better probably since the nineties. But so, so yeah. So, so when we looked
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:27.760]  at scripting AudioHijack 3 came out seven years ago in 2015, and that was sort of a sequel to
[01:48:27.760 --> 01:48:33.440]  multiple AudioHijack products before it. And one of those was AudioHijack Pro 2, which had a little
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:37.840]  bit of scripting built into it. And AudioHijack 3 did not have any scripting built into it.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:41.600]  And so one of the things we heard was from the types of users that we've just talked about who
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.880]  would be upset about losing, you know, their workflows. And people said, you know, I want
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:49.760]  to be able to script. I want to be able to automate some things. And obviously it took us
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.880]  quite a while to do that in the new AudioHijack 4 seven years later. But it was something where
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:01.280]  at the time in 2015, 2016, there, there wasn't a good way to do that. There wasn't an obvious,
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:05.360]  this is the way to do it and it's going to work and it's going to continue to work and be improved
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  as time moves on. The way to do it would have been AppleScript. And that's certainly what we'd used
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.120]  in the past, but that wasn't something that it, it was pretty clear at that point that it was,
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.200]  I don't even know what, it's not a dead end, but it's not, it's not growing. It's not
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.440]  getting any love. It's not getting any attention. So we weren't terribly interested to do anything
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:30.720]  with AppleScript. And we had looked at JavaScript and that was, that was what we felt was the best
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:35.520]  way to do this. And in the years since then, you know, JavaScript has only become more and more
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.920]  popular, more and more essential on the web. So there are a ton of JavaScript programmers out
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.960]  there, a ton of JavaScript tutorials and resources. I don't know if, if you went to Apple and said,
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:51.440]  if you went to, you know, DubDub a few years ago and went to the labs and said, I want to do
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.800]  scripting in my application. How should I do it? I don't even know if they would have told you,
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.240]  oh yeah, AppleScript. That's the way, that's the technology to deal with. And if they would have,
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:01.440]  they were lying. They weren't, you know, they weren't being honest with you or themselves.
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.280]  You know, it's, it's just sort of interesting the way it petered out. Not petered out,
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:14.960]  but the way we wound up here where the idea back in the day in the nineties when AppleScript was
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:22.240]  new and, and what I like to call, I know consistency gets misused as a word that, that,
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:28.000]  you know, one of the hallmarks of the Mac compared to Windows or other operating systems,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.360]  if you go back far enough, you know, when there were more competing PC operating systems was
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:39.600]  consistency between apps that, you know, across the interface and, and that, you know, it's file,
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.440]  edit, view, you know, it's like, what, which app am I talking about? That's all, that's the menu
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.880]  bar for almost all the apps, right? And that, that consistency is very, was good for users.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:57.280]  And that, that AppleScript and OSA scripting, where it was supposed to be this sort of
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.160]  foundational layer object, I forget what OSA stands for, but it would, the idea was,
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:06.560]  was that there'd be this fundamental scripting layer. And if you, if your app adopted it,
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:13.520]  then the user could use any OSA scripting language they wanted to. But it turns out the only one
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.960]  that's ever really stuck is AppleScript. But there were ideas that there'd be one that's more like a
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:23.760]  JavaScript language. You're right. I mean, and again, I don't want to go on a rant about
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.600]  scripting languages, but even if you're not someone who's ever written a script yourself,
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.680]  you could look at AppleScript and see, oh, this is a programming language that's supposed to look like
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:39.600]  English prose. Tell application, and you have all these spaces, you know, like writing a real
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:44.160]  language. Whereas most computer programming languages don't let you use spaces between the
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:49.120]  terms. Right. No, I mean, it's certainly the, the original idea was, or at least part of the
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:53.760]  original idea was something you could read and anybody could look at and pick up and understand.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.960]  Right. But that somebody, you know, there'd be somehow that never took off, right. But
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.320]  then there'd be another language that would be, and right now there is, it's officially supported
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:08.240]  in macOS. It's the JavaScript for automation something. So you can go to the script editor
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:15.360]  app and write an app to drive an AppleScriptable application and write it in JavaScript instead
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:22.720]  of AppleScript. And it's the app's perspective. It all compiles to the same OSA objects and the
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:29.520]  app just gets that support for free, sort of. But it's weird. You look at the JavaScript syntax
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:34.640]  when you're doing that and it's, it's like translating through another language. It's,
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:41.280]  it always reads wrong. It doesn't look like the way anybody would write a real JavaScript API
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:46.960]  today. It looks like JavaScript mimicking the weird idiosyncrasies of the AppleScript language.
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.680]  Of AppleScript.
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:54.400]  Right. And it's like, so like in the alternate world, where seven years ago,
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.560]  Rogue Amoeba said, well, we may not love AppleScript, but that's the Mac scripting
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:03.600]  thing. That's what we should do. And there's an Audio Hijack 4 that supports AppleScript
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.640]  to do all the same things. But you could also use JavaScript in the script editor to do it.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:14.400]  The scripts you would write to perform the same task look totally different.
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:15.440]  Would be very different.
[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:21.680]  Yeah. And the ones that you guys have come up with, with an API native, not just to JavaScript,
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:26.480]  but to sort of modern JavaScript, right? Like I was looking around the documentation and it's
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:31.760]  like, yeah, this looks like, you know, the, the JavaScript APIs I've seen for apps like
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:37.600]  drafts and there's, you know, a couple others. And on iOS, it's interesting because Apple has,
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.880]  I don't know if you've heard this, but Apple has some strict rules about the App Store.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:43.680]  Yeah. I've, I've, I've heard tell, yes.
[01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:50.080]  Huh. Well, one of them is, and this seems to be like a gray zone where they're making more
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:56.720]  and more exceptions, but you're not supposed to have your own scripting engine in your app.
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:53:59.920]  And maybe they've even lessened the official guideline. I forget, but for a while,
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:06.720]  you couldn't make a native iOS app with a scripting language because they didn't want to
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:12.160]  open up the back door to, well, God, God only knows what the app will do once it's running your
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:16.640]  Lua scripts or something like that, or, you know, insert your whatever language it could be, but
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:22.160]  we'll let you use WebKit's JavaScript engine because we, we know what that can do. And that's,
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.280]  we feel that safe. It's not exposing security vulnerabilities to buffer overflows because it's
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:34.560]  our JavaScript engine. So on iOS, there are, have, have been for, you know, 10 plus years apps that
[01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:39.360]  have added scripting or scripting like things, but always using JavaScript, not just because
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:44.400]  JavaScript is popular period, but because it was sort of the only officially sanctioned way to do
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:48.320]  it on iOS, even though I know there's tons of exceptions now, and there's apps that let you
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:53.760]  do stuff with Python. And there are in fact, apps that let you program script, write little scripts
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:59.120]  with the Lua and I'm sure dozens of other languages, but you guys didn't have to pick
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:06.240]  JavaScript though, because of iOS or app store restrictions, because audio hijack is Mac only.
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:10.160]  And in fact is not just Mac only, but is no longer in the app store.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:15.120]  Well, so audio hijack has never been in the app store. Yeah, Piazzo, our little brother
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.520]  to audio hijack was previously in the app store, but yeah, so we, yeah, we didn't have to worry
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:25.120]  about any of those restrictions, but a whole lot of that still influenced us because yeah,
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:29.520]  if you've got a decade worth of JavaScript programming going on on iOS, people are going
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.480]  to know how to do these things and the people using an iPhone and a Mac are more likely to
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:40.880]  have that experience and just to be able to make this work. So yeah, it was something where the
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.120]  timing, over time, it became clear that this was the best way for us to do this. And so far,
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.120]  you know, this has only been out for, what are we, two weeks, but you know, we've seen a whole
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:54.720]  lot of uptake from people who are interested to automate various parts of their workflows.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:00.160]  And the other thing from iOS that we haven't even touched on is shortcuts. Shortcuts,
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.800]  iOS originally workflow, but you know, shortcuts on iOS that have been there for a couple of years.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  And then on macOS 12, having shortcuts be part of the Mac. That was another part of the automation
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.200]  that we implemented in Audio Hijack 4 was that we have a couple of shortcuts that you can use and
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:19.520]  then you can tie in all different sorts of ways, not just dealing with JavaScript, but our good
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.440]  friend Jason Snell has had a couple posts on doing things with shortcuts and using like a stream deck,
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.320]  a hardware device that can run a shortcut and trigger, you know, start a session running and
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:36.640]  start a recording and basically just making it possible to—anything that is possible with the
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.320]  scripting that we've implemented and with the shortcuts, it was already possible. It's just
[01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:45.200]  making it a whole lot easier and it's making it a whole lot simpler to integrate into things that
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.680]  you're already doing such that, you know, it can be one click instead of needing to do it all
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:56.640]  manually. It's something where we've, for years, we've done various types of scripting and early
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.120]  on, we were doing Apple scripting stuff and we always sort of layered it on top of the application
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:06.800]  and that was sort of what made sense was because most users weren't using scripting, but those who
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:11.600]  were really loved it and they appreciated it and then, you know, it's the sort of thing people talk
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.000]  about and ideally, in an ideal world, you've got an application that's scriptable and people are
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.760]  sharing scripts and you've got a whole community around that. I don't know that—we've yet to have
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:24.320]  an application like that. Audio Hijack 4 is potentially, you know, a little more headed
[01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:29.680]  that way in terms of podcasters who are doing similar things. But yeah, it's something where,
[01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.320]  for us, scripting has sort of evolved over time from early on, it was something we did because of
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:39.840]  AppleScript and that was just, you know, a good Mac app had AppleScript support and then over time,
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:44.320]  that no longer was true, but people still want to have that automation and this is sort of the
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:52.720]  best way to do it right now. Yeah, I think it's fascinating and it spans these different eras of
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:57.360]  personal computing in a way, especially a company like Apple, which has always tried to be
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:03.440]  democratizing in terms, you know, of its ability to let people who, you know, the computer for the
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:07.600]  rest of us, you know, who were the rest of us? Well, the people who didn't understand what the
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.960]  computers before, how they were. What the early 80s, late 70s computers required you to know.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.840]  Right. I don't know what I would do with this thing and I don't know how to do the things I
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.680]  might think I might want to do with it, you know, make it easier to understand and democratize
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.160]  computing and let you be creative with it. But one of those things that's gone by the wayside,
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:32.640]  I think it was a noble idea. I think it made intuitive sense. I actually, at the time,
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:38.640]  like when AppleScript came out, believed that this might be the way of the future, that an English
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:45.200]  like programming language might be just what the doctor ordered to get a wider audience. People
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:51.120]  like me and you, Paul, you know, who are programmer-y, you know, and kind of understand
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:56.400]  computers, but really should not be writing, you know, objectives here, Swift-like. It's just,
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:01.680]  you know, that's different. We have much smarter people working at Rogamiba than I am to deal with
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:06.800]  that. Way fast people who could do, you know, and it's like, what, how did you do this in a day?
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:10.880]  And it's like, oh, you know, I'm a good programmer. It's like, wow. But I just thought that was the
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:14.960]  way of the future and that, you know, that the problem with computer programming that was,
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:22.880]  the idea was, well, maybe just this bizarre mathematical-like notation is turning a huge
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:28.000]  segment off. And, you know, because that's what most programming languages are like. They more
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.840]  resemble algebra and make it more like prose, and it might open the doors to more people.
[01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:38.960]  And HyperCard was obviously in exactly along the same lines of that. But at the time, Apple,
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:43.120]  you know, as opposed to today's Apple, where they're pretty good about reusing stuff when
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:49.360]  they can, like shortcuts being on all platforms now, you know, HyperTalk, the programming language
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:55.840]  of HyperCard was very similar to AppleScript, but completely incompatible. And yet a totally
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.800]  different thing. But also more popular and I think it was a better take at that idea. But it turns
[02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:07.760]  out that whole English-like programming language thing truly did peter out. And I think rightly
[02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:10.880]  so. I don't think that was the problem. I don't think that's the thing that was keeping people
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:16.080]  from scripting. But the idea was if you make it like that, more people will do it. And then I
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:21.520]  think people got turned off from, including Apple, from emphasizing scriptability. And it's like,
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:26.160]  ah, we tried that. We spent all this time. It's a lot of work, right? I mean, I'm sure you'll agree.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:34.800]  It's adding a rich scripting system to an app is a lot of engineering work and design work, right?
[02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:41.120]  It is because it has to be, if you want it to be good, you know, it's really hard work designing
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:49.040]  APIs and anticipating things that people might want to do. It's a lot of work. And then I think
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:54.000]  the argument is, and we know that almost none of our users are going to write scripts. So why should
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.240]  we do it? It's a tiny percentage of, yeah. So even if you're the biggest application in the world,
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:03.760]  it's going to be one, two, 5% of your users that are actively creating scripts for it.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:10.560]  Right. And my counter argument to that is that it's the, you know, I don't know that anything
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:15.760]  exemplifies it better than the browser extension market, right? Like browser extensions are
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:24.320]  probably almost as mainstream as apps for mobile phones, right? Lots of very typical people have
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:30.640]  browser extensions. Capital One has ads asking you to install their browser extension running
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:36.480]  on TV. So people certainly understand what a browser extension is to a great level, yeah.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.960]  Right. And really, you know, like I said earlier, browser extensions are really just
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.600]  scripting interface for browsers. It's scripting. You're writing in JavaScript, and you're doing
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:49.840]  these things, you know, it could just be a little tiny tweak, just a way to, you know,
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:53.360]  hook up your Capital One account to whatever the hell they're doing.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.720]  Showing discounts or something, yeah.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:59.680]  Yeah, probably. Something scammy like that, spying on you. That's probably what all these
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:04.080]  extensions are doing, is spying on you. But it's a small number of people create them,
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:09.040]  and a larger number of people can then share, take that work that was shared and install
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:15.040]  it and use these things that, you know, maybe wouldn't make sense for Rogue Amoeba to build
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:19.840]  in because there's still too few people. But the people who need that, oh my God, like,
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.040]  being able to press one button on my Steam Deck and have it, you know, trigger an action
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.680]  in Audio Hijack 4 while I'm recording a podcast or something like that, that's exactly what
[02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:33.120]  I needed. I never would have thought to do it. Thank you, Jason Snell, for sharing it.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:42.640]  Or, it could be that so many people are using a handful of extensions for Audio Hijack 4 that,
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:49.520]  by the time Audio Hijack 4.1 or 4.5 comes out, you could build some of those features in.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:50.560]  You could Sherlock them.
[02:02:51.760 --> 02:02:56.640]  Yeah, I mean, well, so we're not expecting anyone to try and sell anything. So, yeah,
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.040]  if something happens where we see, oh, you know what, that should be a first-party feature,
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:04.800]  that should be built in, I don't think we'll be hurting anybody with that, and hopefully it would
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:09.280]  be helping more people do it. But yeah, it's something where, so when we created the API
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:13.520]  for this, we sort of intentionally, you know, we had a beta test and showed this to a lot of
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:20.160]  people who would be using it, but we intentionally said, this is a skeleton, and we want to see what
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:28.400]  people build on it and then potentially add to that API. But the 4.0.0 API that we just released,
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.440]  we don't view as final because we don't know exactly what people are going to do with it
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.520]  and how we can make it better. And there's two things we can do there. You were talking
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.640]  about anticipating what people might do, and obviously we had to do some of that to
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.400]  create the basics of the API. But over time, we're going to watch and see, okay, people are
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:50.800]  looking to automate something that is not currently possible to automate. We should
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:56.400]  add that. And then people are using this script all over the place. That should just be a feature
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:59.840]  in the application, and you shouldn't need a script to do it at all. And at this point,
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.440]  the app is fairly mature. You know, it's been around for 20 years. So I don't know that there's
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.880]  a ton of things that we're going to discover that way, but there's at least the possibility
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.640]  that we'll see people doing things that, oh, you know what, that's something we wouldn't have
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.040]  thought of ourselves, but it's worth including in the application, and you won't need scripting
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:20.400]  for that. And that has value. Even, you know, all that scripting work can help guide that
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:24.160]  development. It doesn't just have to be about the ultimate scripts that people are making with it.
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:29.840]  Yeah. And not to keep going back to drafts, but, you know, drafts implements a bunch of the built-in
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:37.600]  features of the notes editor in its own extensions, you know, and it's... In addition to, I think,
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:43.680]  making life easier for Greg Pierce, the developer and designer of drafts at Agile Tortoise, you know,
[02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:46.960]  because he can just write this quick thing in JavaScript, I know firsthand because I've
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:50.960]  written to him. And he's said, well, you know, that's a great idea for a feature request,
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:54.160]  but also here, I've attached this action. You could just add this to drafts.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:54.640]  It just does it already.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:59.120]  Yeah, it just does it already. And I was like, oh, well, I guess I should have thought of that
[02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:03.120]  myself. And I could have done that. And then I look at the syntax. I'm like, oh, yeah, I figure
[02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:09.040]  that makes a lot of sense. But that's happened to me. And, you know, it's a cool thing, but I don't
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:12.720]  know, I was very excited to see it. I'm always excited to see it. But the other thing about
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.840]  AppleScript compared to today, and I feel like I have so many complaints about shortcuts,
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:23.280]  but I'm so happy overall. And it's like the note it exists at all now that it's on the Mac. But
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:29.040]  I think adding it to the Mac has really it to my view now, I don't think it's my personal bias,
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:35.040]  as if someone, an Apple user whose favorite platform is unlikely will always remain the Mac.
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:40.960]  I don't think it's that bias. I think it's it's real that shortcuts enthusiasm,
[02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:46.720]  nerd of nerd universe wide skyrocketed over the last year, now that it's once it came to the Mac.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:54.480]  Yep, because it includes apps like yours, right, which are only on the Mac. And that's if it's
[02:05:54.480 --> 02:06:01.200]  interesting to me, but to me, the thing that's clear is that there's sort of like inter is that
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:08.080]  right inter application. So having one application, control another, and maybe, you know,
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:13.360]  involve three or four applications in the whole thing, like you're getting text out of BB edit,
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:21.840]  and or text out of drafts to put into a BB edit document and also somehow getting audio out of
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:28.240]  audio hijack. And you've got this whole thing will work together, you could use shortcuts as the sort
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:34.880]  of framework for talking to all of these apps that support shortcuts. But then within each app,
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:41.760]  they can do whatever makes the most sense for them. You know, like a custom JavaScript API,
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:48.000]  just for audio hijack that is meant for it. And it sounds like that's more complicated,
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.400]  because Apple script was supposed to be both things. It is both things, right. But it's like,
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:59.360]  all I want to do is do a 10 step process in BB edit, you could do the whole thing in Apple
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:04.960]  script. And the only app the script ever talks to is BB edit. But Apple script was also the
[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:09.840]  cross platform thing, or cross application thing, cross application, inter application.
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:15.840]  But the thing that made that so frustrating is that no two applications had the same style
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:20.960]  of dictionaries, right for Apple script, it didn't work that well. No, it was like talking
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:27.040]  a completely different dialect of of the programming language. Once you were inside
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:33.680]  the tell application, whatever that Mac apps name is, once you're telling that application,
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:41.600]  you're using that apps dictionary. And it's, it might as well have been a different effectively,
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:46.320]  it's a different API, we call them dictionaries. But it's like each app had its own API for
[02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:51.600]  scripting anyway. So the fact that they were all glued together at the Apple script layer,
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:56.560]  really wasn't more convenient. In fact, it was more confusing, because there'd be things that
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:01.360]  looked like they were the same, but were different. Whereas, okay, I'm just using shortcuts to talk
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:06.800]  to three different apps. But then within that app, I'm telling audio hijack to fire off an extension
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:11.200]  or an action or something like that. And I can just write all that in JavaScript right there and
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:17.040]  audio hijack. I think that's actually it's both the it seems to be the way the whole
[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:21.680]  platforms, plural, have gone. But I actually think it makes more sense that way.
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:27.360]  I mean, it's certainly the proof is in the pudding. And we're seeing a whole lot more
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.520]  uptake with this than we ever did with with, you know, cross cross application, Apple scripting.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.080]  So yeah, I think I think it's, I don't know that you'd sit down and you'd say, yes, this is how it
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:42.000]  should work. But it does work. And and, you know, it is why we have shortcuts support, we and didn't
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.040]  have things like Apple script support for for many years. So, yeah, it's it's been it's been
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:50.640]  interesting to see. I was talking to somebody about the shortcuts app. I was talking with you
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:53.360]  about it, but I was talking with somebody else about it. And I was saying that the only thing
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.800]  worse than the shortcuts app on the Mac would be not having the shortcuts app on the Mac.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.200]  It's a very bad application. It needs a lot of work. And hopefully I think it's popular enough
[02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:09.200]  that it will get some work. But the fact that it enables so much to be done makes it possible to
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:14.880]  overlook or to look past, I should say, all of its flaws or most of its flaws anyway. And you know,
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:20.000]  sort of put up with it because because it exists, it's possible to do so many things. And even
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.920]  though it's a crummy app, the output of it is still useful and still functional. So it's it's
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.520]  this bizarre. We were talking you and I were talking about catalyst apps in general, and it's
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:35.120]  this bizarre, not very good app on the Mac. But it's better than the app not existing on the Mac.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:39.920]  Trenton Larkin Yeah, I don't think it's catalyst, though. I think it's SwiftUI,
[02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:46.000]  which is well, okay, even I think, which is why it's even worse. Because there's just certain
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:52.320]  things that even catalyst would get right. But that with that SwiftUI didn't even support into,
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:56.080]  you know, natively, like, I haven't I haven't drilled down on it too much. I've just had to
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:00.320]  poke at it and said, This is not a Mac. One of my favorite examples. It's just the smallest thing.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:05.440]  But if you prompt the user for text, and it shows it doesn't matter if you're on iOS or the Mac,
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.600]  it shows a little dialog box. And you can type some text. And then there's like a cancel button
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:18.320]  to cancel it, or an OK button to go on to the next step, passing the text you entered to the next
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:26.640]  step of your shortcut. On the Mac. When you hit the on iOS, there is no hardware return key,
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.120]  right? You have to you if you hit a return, you can just enter a new line of text within the
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.360]  field. And you'd always have to hit your right there on screen anyway, you just hit the OK button
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:43.120]  to make it go away. On the Mac. What happens if you want to dismiss it with the keyboard and the
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:49.280]  button is blue, right? It says okay, or done or something, you know, says done, done. And the,
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:54.960]  the return button doesn't do that. Because instead, they want to allow you which is
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:11:00.000]  reasonable to enter multi lines of text, multiple lines of text right in the text field return is
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.720]  used in the text field to just give you a new line, right? There's a standard for this. It's
[02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:12.160]  been around forever. It is command return. Because option return always enters a return option is you
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:17.760]  can't you shouldn't use option for it. Because option would enter a return in a dialogue,
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.400]  even if it didn't support right, even if the return return, if the plain unmodified return
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:26.960]  key activated the done button, then option return is how you literally enter a new line.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:32.400]  But shortcuts until like three weeks ago, or a month ago, used FN return.
[02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:40.240]  And I always just made it up. They just picked a new they just picked a new one.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:46.960]  And, and it's not even on most keyboards unless they're Apple branded, right. So if you use any
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:52.720]  third party USB keyboard, which again is not a thing on iOS, but you know, it's clearly a thing
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:57.520]  that many keyboard enthusiasts are involved with on Mac, you may not even have an FN key.
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:03.920]  I'm reminded I got to tell this story. I know we're going a little long, but many several years
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:08.240]  ago, Brent, our good friend Brent Simmons was here in Philadelphia, and we took him to eat.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:13.600]  And Jonas was younger, much younger at the time. And across the street from the restaurant where
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:19.040]  we went to with Brent, it was me and my wife and young Jonas and Brent, we went to a Del Frisco
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:24.240]  steakhouse down on Chestnut Street across the street was a Wendy's, but the Wendy's, the sign
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:29.760]  was was not fully functional. And so instead of saying Wendy's old fashioned hamburgers,
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.040]  literally the part of the sign that was out the neon or whatever it was made of was the
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:45.680]  Ashend, Asha. So it literally looked like Wendy's old FN hamburgers. And Brent, Brent pointed it out
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.960]  to like 11 year old Jonas or 10 year old Jonas. And of course, Jonas. Well, I think Jonas would
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:57.520]  still enjoy that very much. But it became it's a family joke now and that the Brent Simmons is part
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:04.080]  of our extended family enjoyed Wendy's old FN hamburgers. But I now I always think of it when
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:11.760]  it comes to the FN key on the keyboards. And I thought that there was no better use of it than
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:19.840]  when Shortcuts made you use FN return, use the FN return key. Right. But now wait, you said three
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:26.640]  or four weeks ago, did they change? Yes, in the Mac OS 12.3 update. And I, in fact, highlighted it
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.800]  on Daring Fire, probably the one of the least popular. That's right. That's right. I highlighted
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:37.280]  it because I was personally so happy about it. Because it's not just that the that the it to me,
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:42.640]  I was so happy about it, not because of the bug itself irritated me. It's that I there,
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.400]  they're clearly Mac affine shortcuts, right? It's not making it more like a Mac app, right.
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:54.960]  And it makes me very happy. I can't help but think there's always a chicken and an egg problem with
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:00.240]  automation in general, where, like I said, like you get like a product manager hat on yourself,
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:04.880]  and you can you can make an argument. This isn't worth the engineering time. We have features to
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:10.400]  add that 90% of our users will use or 60% of users want this. Anything more than like,
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:16.720]  one or 2% will use. Right. And it's like, well, but if you don't have it, how do you know how
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:21.840]  many people would actually use the scripts from others? Right. It's like it in, you know, and I
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:28.240]  think the future of Apple automation, post AppleScript, you know, and part of the whole
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.320]  thing with AppleScript is it never made it to iOS for good reason, I think, but it was not replaced
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:40.480]  until shortcuts came about. Right. And so there was a long stretch where there was literally no
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:46.720]  user level automation built into iOS at all, despite the fact that it was the most popular
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.760]  platform that Apple has ever made and arguably the single most popular personal computing platform
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:56.800]  any company has ever made in the history of computers, no automation, and which seemed,
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:03.600]  you know, criminal, right? Like, you know, that's sort of what computers are for. And it just,
[02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:10.720]  I feel like that chicken and egg problem, if shortcuts, would it have been my preference? No,
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.520]  probably not. But I'm just so happy that it's something. And now that they've done it and
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:20.880]  brought it to the Mac, and I think it's the enthusiastic response is so strong that Apple
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:26.880]  clearly must see that. And if there was any doubts within Apple about how much to devote to it,
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:33.600]  I would hope that that's been erased and that the pro, hey, we should, we should fully embrace
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:43.600]  shortcuts and cross application, cross platform shortcuts as best and fully as we can. I would
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:47.760]  have to think they're on board with that now. And that to me is very exciting. And the FN,
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:55.040]  the FN return key to me exemplifies the optimistic, sunny future of automation on
[02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:59.280]  Apple's platforms. Well, fingers crossed. All right, let me take a break here. I have one
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.680]  final sponsor who I want to thank. It's our good friends at Memberful. That's where you can
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.720]  monetize your passion with membership. It allows you, a creative individual, to build a sustainable
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:14.480]  recurring revenue based on your creative work. It is the easiest way to sell memberships to
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:20.880]  your audience, whether you're a writer or a podcaster or a visual artist or a video artist,
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.120]  or you name it, a YouTuber. They have everything you need to run a membership program,
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:29.840]  including custom branding, gift certificates, Apple pay, free trials, private podcasts,
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:35.520]  and tons more. Memberful seamlessly integrates with the tools you already use. They keep you
[02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:43.760]  in full control of your brand, your audience and your memberships. It's always your brand
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.680]  in front. And if you ever decide that you want to leave, you want to take your membership system
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:53.200]  elsewhere, it's as easy as possible. You just export it, you take it away. That's just how
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:58.320]  confident they are that you're not going to want to leave Memberful. They only get paid when you
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:03.280]  get paid and you only get paid when you have people in your audience who are happy to subscribe
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:08.320]  to your memberships through Memberful. It's just a terrific service. I subscribe to probably at
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.960]  least half a dozen Memberful sites, probably more if I actually dug into it, but sites like
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:17.760]  Six Colors at Jason Snell's site that we just mentioned earlier on the show, all sorts of relay
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:23.280]  FM podcasts have Memberful. It's really just a terrific way to do it. And you can get started
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:29.680]  for free with no credit card required. Where do you go? Go to memberful.com slash talk show.
[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:34.960]  That's memberful.com slash talk show. Monetize your passions with membership.
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:38.480]  Anything else you want to talk about with Audio Hijack? Any other interesting tidbits about
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:44.640]  version four, the sort of thing that you couldn't really emphasize on the webpage or in the email to
[02:17:44.640 --> 02:17:49.200]  users telling them about it, but that you would love to talk about on a second hour of a podcast
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:57.440]  like this? Oh, wow. I was not prepared for that question. I mean, we just spent so much time on
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:02.640]  so many little parts of this. But yeah, in the past month, I've been focused on the things that
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:09.920]  I can tout. Yeah, I don't know. People should come check it out. And if they need to do anything
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:14.400]  with audio on their computer, then it's the application to do it. Yeah, I don't know. The
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.880]  scripting stuff has been really interesting just to see what people are doing with it. And I'm
[02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:25.680]  hoping to see more in the next few months of it being out there. And as I said earlier, just sort
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:30.000]  of see how that guides our development with it. Yeah, I don't know. I'm sure there's a ton of
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.720]  stuff in there. When I wrote up our blog post and our press release and everything, and I was going
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:40.720]  through our change log, and there were over 100 different notable bullet points. So that was fun
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:45.440]  that there was just this huge round number of stuff that we've done. When usually an update,
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:52.240]  even a major upgrade can be as little as 10 or 20 major things. We got over 100. So there's a ton
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:56.000]  of them. But I'd say just reading the release notes is really the way to go. I know you're a
[02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:03.120]  big fan of quality release notes, like Barebones always has. And I strive to at least have readable
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.400]  and useful release notes in there. I love reading release notes. I know most people don't. But again,
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:12.800]  it's another one of those things like scripting support. Like sure, most of your users aren't
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:17.520]  going to read the whole list. But the ones who do are really going to appreciate it. Just along the
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:25.520]  lines of the way—I know you agree. I know you and I have spoken about this. But writing clarifies
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:31.040]  your thinking. And sometimes I just don't know what I think about something until I actually
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:37.200]  write about it. And I might think I do. But until I actually start writing about it, I realize,
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:41.440]  ah, you know what, I kind of have a dot dot dot, a yada yada yada in there that I've never really
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:46.560]  thought through. And that's actually, oh, that's pretty tricky. I feel like copiously documenting
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:53.200]  your software's changes is clarifying. Well, and that's one of the first things I do,
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:57.520]  especially for a major upgrade, is I'll run through the changelog and work that out.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:01.840]  And then I've got, in this case, over 100 different things that I'm looking at. And I say,
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:06.000]  okay, so which of these do we think are the most important? And which of these do we think are the
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.200]  most interesting to talk about? And as you said, it clarifies sort of how to market things and
[02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:14.800]  how we're going to—what we're going to focus on and put in front of users.
[02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:20.880]  Do you think it's—is it tricky at this point, 20 years in, to balance the how do we please
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:26.000]  our existing users and get them to pay for an upgrade and keep them as happy users versus how
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.760]  do we expand to new users? And like you said, there's obviously a lot of new users out there
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:35.600]  for an app that has the capabilities that Audio Hijack does.
[02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:39.440]  I mean, it's not something where we ever—well, I shouldn't say that. We don't usually look at
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:43.840]  a feature and say, oh, this will bring in a new group or this will please the existing group.
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:48.000]  I would say mostly when we—once we've implemented something, we either
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.400]  assume that it's sort of done or we hear from people and we say, okay, we need to improve that.
[02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:57.120]  So, you know, something like scripting was—that was something where we heard from users of version
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:00.960]  three and they said, oh, a lot of people said, oh, I want to use that. I want to have scripting.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:05.360]  I want to have automation. And that's something that we think, okay, that'll sell upgrades.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:09.120]  People will say, okay, I want that for the new—so I'll purchase the upgrade.
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:13.280]  I don't tend to think about how do we sell upgrades to people because
[02:21:13.280 --> 02:21:17.120]  we don't sell a lot of upgrades. We've only had—I'd have to do the math now,
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:22.320]  but over 20 years, we've had maybe 10 paid upgrades. It might even be fewer than that.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:27.520]  We're focused on selling to new users all the time and assuming that the existing users
[02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:32.160]  are satisfied and that when there is a new version that they will come along to it because
[02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:36.880]  eventually we're going to drop the old version. We don't do that quickly. We make them last a
[02:21:36.880 --> 02:21:42.480]  lot longer than some products do. But I don't—we don't really optimize for, oh, we need to make
[02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:46.320]  people purchase the new version. We just try and make it as good as possible. And then I think for
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:51.200]  the most part, people say, okay, yep, I've used this. If somebody bought AudioHijacked in 2015,
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:57.200]  they have had seven years' worth of free updates and a $29 upgrade hopefully looks like a pretty
[02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:02.480]  good deal at that point. It's honestly, when I put it that way, it sounds awfully inexpensive
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:06.000]  to the point where hopefully people, a lot of people do say, you know, oh, I saw there was
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.080]  an upgrade. I got it immediately without even looking at it. So that's one where I obviously
[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:15.760]  don't need to sell people on it. I think that you're
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:21.680]  —all of Rogue Amoeba's apps have always done such a good—you guys have done such a good job
[02:22:21.680 --> 02:22:29.280]  culling them over the years to keep them looking fresh, new, up to date. I mean, I could go on and
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:36.640]  on about the user interface design of all of your apps, but I just love the balance between, oh,
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:43.600]  this is obviously a very Mac-like Mac app that is up to date and uses, you know, sort of customizes
[02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:49.440]  things in a way for branding, like you've got distinct colors, but all the controls look like
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:54.000]  real Mac controls. And if anything, whenever they deviate from like the system standard ones,
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.200]  they look better, right? Which is, you know, it's an exquisite attention to detail, you know,
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:06.320]  and then like, I know it's not just because I'm your friend and it's not just because, oh, it's
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:12.080]  John Gruber of Daring Fireball, but it's like, I can tell you about a straight apostrophe in the
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:18.800]  first run screen. And it's like, I could see how this sneaks past them. The first run screen often
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:22.960]  has little things like that because you don't see it as much because if you're testing it,
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:27.280]  you've got to like wipe all your preferences and then relaunch the app to get the first run
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.200]  experience. And I'm sure you do look at it, but it's, you know, it's a more likely place
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:34.800]  for something like that. I tell you there's a straight apostrophe. I know it's going to get
[02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:44.000]  fixed. It is. It did. And I have the release notes for version 4.0.1. And let me pull it up right
[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.680]  here. I said, fussy typography improvements have been made to the release notes window,
[02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.280]  which you might be looking at right now, which you would be. And that was, you know, I didn't mention
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:56.960]  you by name, but that was a result of you DMing me or iMessaging me and me saying, yep, you're
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:02.880]  right. That's not right. And we're going to fix it. I actually like it when something like that
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:09.040]  that I've reported to, whether it's you or to Rich at Barebones or any of the other apps I
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  use where I know the developers, I like it when they don't thank me in the release notes, because
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:17.360]  I know, I know that. Right. You know, fussy typography improvements is for you. I didn't
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.080]  even have to keep reading. I know we've got a lot of it. Let's briefly, briefly look ahead to WWDC,
[02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:27.760]  which was announced last week. I, yeah, in between my last episode from March and this episode,
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:33.680]  WWDC was announced sort of. Right. I mean, they announced the dates. They announced that there's
[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:39.360]  going to be this weird watch party in person, but not an actual in-person dub-dub. Right.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:48.720]  So it's a weird thing right now. And, you know, it's, I'm, I say this living as somebody living
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:55.040]  in Philadelphia, the first city in the country to go back to a mandatory indoor mask mandate,
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:25:00.320]  which again, I could do a whole two-hour podcast ranting about. I think it's both a policy mistake
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:05.280]  and a political mistake that is going to be grossly, it is already grossly unpopular. I
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:10.960]  think it makes no sense. You know, everybody jokes about it, but it's no joke that you go
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:15.600]  into a restaurant and you have to wear a mask until they take you to your table. And then you
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:22.640]  take off your mask to eat and drink your beverages. And then you go out and you put your mask on when
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:27.040]  you get to the door. Put your mask on to walk the 10 feet back out the door. And this suppresses an
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:33.440]  airborne respiratory virus. How? I mean, but anyway, you know, I realize COVID is not over.
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:37.520]  And here in Philadelphia, we're putting our masks back on. But oddly enough, even though they
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:41.600]  announced the return of a mask mandate, which is... It's for a week from now. A week from now.
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:47.040]  I love, that's my favorite part is because we did the same thing in Boston. We had a mask
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:52.320]  mandate and a vaccine mandate that took effect farther in the future. And if it's important,
[02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.120]  let's just do it right now. And not, you know, nobody needs to go to jail if they don't have
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.680]  their vaccine yet. But you know, you say, okay, well, it's time to do it. You don't need a whole
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:07.520]  month to implement it. On the one hand, it exasperates me because it's like, obviously,
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.360]  this isn't an emergency if you're giving us a week. But on the other hand, I'm glad because
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.800]  I'm going to go out and buy as much stuff as I can. And then never go out for the next month.
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.160]  Yeah. So it's like, I guess we'll go out to eat a couple of times this weekend and, you know,
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:24.960]  live it up without our masks until next week when this week's emergency measure takes effect.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:33.040]  But I realized though, from a WWDC planning perspective, no matter how solid one feels
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:44.160]  about COVID being at a manageable place overall, I don't think the traditional in-person WWDC could
[02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:51.680]  possibly have been planned for June. We just don't know. Of all the things you could do,
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:59.520]  packing 5,000, I guess counting the Apple employees, 7,000 people into a convention
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:02.400]  hall is, you know, among the least recommendable. And I...
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:03.680]  That's not a great idea. Yeah.
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:07.120]  But, you know, I say this knowing that, you know, the NBA playoffs are started and,
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:13.520]  you know, there's 30,000 people going to these basketball games and arenas. So the 7,000 people
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:18.720]  at WWDC is, you know, a third the size of that. I'm just saying if you could do your convention,
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:24.800]  you can't really play basketball otherwise. I mean, I guess they did during the lockdown,
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:29.360]  but it was no fun. You could see why sporting events are back. It would have been very
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:34.560]  surprising to me if they had announced last week, WWDC is back and it's exactly like it used to be
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:38.480]  before COVID. That would have been pretty surprising. And I think ill-advised.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:41.840]  But some conferences, there have been some conferences, have there not?
[02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:44.880]  Oh, yeah, definitely. Vegas is back full swing. You know, I was just...
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.080]  Some random thing about... Just a random story outside my usual wheelhouse,
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.120]  but about like car dealers and, you know, a big car dealer conference in Vegas and
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:00.480]  all sorts of places are having conferences. It's a weird mix of people who don't even
[02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:04.960]  realize how much a lot of the world has gone back to normal and people who would be
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.040]  flabbergasted if Apple said, we're going to have 5,000 attendees.
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:15.760]  Horrified if they had at all a normal WW. Well, so they did this weird hybrid though,
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:21.520]  or it sounds like they're doing this weird hybrid where it's unclear, although I think if you read
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:27.440]  it properly, you can tell that on day one, they're going to have an event where you can go and watch,
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.160]  but it sounds like it's going to be videos. So it doesn't sound like anything will be live in
[02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.720]  front of you. So you can go and watch the keynote, almost like going to a movie theater.
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:42.480]  Right. But they haven't even said where it is, right? And again, I think this is typical Apple,
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.480]  well, we can hedge our bets on this, so why not? We'll just tell people as late as possible.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:47.760]  Right, keep the flexibility, yeah.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:50.720]  But, you know, is it going to be outdoors on a lawn?
[02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:55.760]  I would bet. I mean, it doesn't make any sense to pack people in to watch a video,
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:58.240]  but not pack them in to, you know, see sessions.
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:04.160]  Right. Yeah, I don't get it. And I know some people wear masks outdoors. It's
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:09.600]  widely accepted, though, that COVID doesn't really transmit very much outdoors, if at all.
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:16.880]  So certainly it's safer, you know, whether to meet any particular person's definition of safe enough,
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.720]  you know, that's up to that person. But clearly outdoors would be safer than indoors,
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:26.800]  but no details, except that they said seating will be limited. Could be something where they're
[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:31.840]  going to have events all over the world, you know, I don't know, you know, or at least several
[02:29:31.840 --> 02:29:36.080]  locations around the world, not just somewhere in California. And would it be?
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.040]  Oh, that's interesting.
[02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:44.480]  Right? And where would it be in California? Like, I was thinking like San Jose,
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.840]  but why would they even have it in San Jose if they're not at the convention center?
[02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:53.200]  No, my thought was outdoors in the middle of Apple Park, you know, you can set up a big
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:56.080]  video screen as long as—it doesn't rain a lot there in the weather.
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:57.200]  You mean inside the ring?
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.080]  Yeah.
[02:29:58.080 --> 02:30:00.560]  Oh, I don't think they want to ever let outsiders in there.
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:04.320]  Okay. Well, I mean, that's where they've had like concerts at Apple employees.
[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:10.560]  Yeah, Apple employees. I think that they—I don't know exactly what level of it is security and what
[02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:14.400]  level of it is something else, but—
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:15.280]  Psychological or whatever.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:17.520]  But you've never been there, but there is—
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:18.020]  I haven't.
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:25.920]  The old visitor center at Infinite Loop was—Infinite Loop was not very Apple-like
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:31.200]  architecture-wise. Or it is not. I know it's still stuffed to the gills with people who work
[02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:35.760]  there because there are so many employees. But like the company store, it's just in one of the
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:43.440]  buildings. You just park where employees park, and you just walk right into, you know, the new
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:49.520]  Apple Park. The ring building and the Steve Jobs Theater are across the road from the visitor
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:54.240]  center. And the visitor center has its own parking lot, and that is where the media park for an
[02:30:54.240 --> 02:31:01.120]  event. But then they have—you could see how unusual it is that those of us parking at the
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:08.640]  visitor center for an event are being escorted over here, across the street, up this walkway to
[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:14.640]  get to the Steve Jobs Theater. I mean, they could do it at the Steve Jobs Theater. The Steve Jobs
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:19.520]  Theater is sort of meant for that, but it really doesn't seat many people at all. I mean, it's
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:22.880]  certainly bigger than the town hall we mentioned before, but it's just a couple hundred. That
[02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:29.520]  doesn't really make sense. And it's indoors. But there's no way to get to that center courtyard of
[02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:35.840]  the ring without going through a place that I don't think was ever meant to take any visitors
[02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:41.120]  at all. It just isn't set up for that. So I don't think so. I mean, if you could teleport them
[02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:45.440]  there, it's certainly enough space. And like you said, they've had concerts and stuff like that,
[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:51.120]  but it won't be there. Well, so here's my question for you. If it is only in California,
[02:31:51.120 --> 02:31:57.280]  will you go to that if there's a press portion of it? I don't know. And I guess I can say,
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:01.120]  because there's nothing under NDA, because I haven't heard anything from anybody at Apple,
[02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:07.520]  whether there is a press thing. Or if it is from the media's perspective, it'll be exactly like
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:13.520]  the last two, where you just watch wherever you watch remotely, and all of our post-event media
[02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:19.840]  briefings are conducted via Webex and stuff like that. I don't know. I guess if it's in person for
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:24.560]  the media, I would like to go. I mean, I'm ready to go back. That makes a lot more sense. I've
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:29.120]  talked with other developers and things, and there's not a lot of enthusiasm that I've seen
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:35.440]  to go to this watch party as a developer, because it's a trip to California, which,
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:40.800]  you know, from the East Coast, it's a trek. And it doesn't sound like—we'll see what Apple
[02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:46.080]  announces—but it doesn't sound like there's going to be a lot to it, as opposed to a week of
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:51.840]  sessions and after-work things that the conference usually is or formerly has been.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:55.520]  Yeah, my guess is it's just the Monday stuff, which would be the morning keynote,
[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:58.880]  then the afternoon State of the Union keynote with the technical details.
[02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:00.080]  That's all they've announced, yeah.
[02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:04.960]  And then maybe they'll have the Apple Design Awards, you know, and let you watch them. I mean,
[02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:08.400]  they move Apple Design Awards all over the place on the schedule, but, you know,
[02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:15.440]  it would certainly slot right in as something to do as the third thing of the Monday.
[02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:16.080]  Of the day.
[02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:21.840]  You know, and then Tuesday through Friday are when the regular sessions come out,
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:27.680]  and they're all just like the last two years, just online. They were pre-recorded. Probably,
[02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:32.080]  you know, there are probably people listening to this podcast this week who are hard at work on
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:37.280]  their WWDC presentations and Cupertino, you know. That's my guess. I don't know. The only other
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:41.280]  thing I could think of, other than the keynote, the State of the Union, would be the Apple Design
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:47.840]  Awards or some other special thing. You know, maybe they would have a band come and simulcance
[02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:49.040]  a band. I don't know.
[02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:52.880]  But yeah, it sounds like it makes a lot more sense. If there's an in-person press thing,
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:57.680]  that makes sense to go to. But if there's an in-person, if all the in-person developer portion
[02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:03.440]  is watching a couple videos, and even if there's a band or something, it to me is not worth a trip
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:07.760]  across the country. I think they'll get a whole lot of people from California attending that and
[02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:09.280]  not from very far away beyond that.
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:14.880]  Yeah, correction here. I'm getting a piece on my earpiece. I actually loaded up their website,
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.560]  and I'm glad I did. It does say here on the website, go to Apple.com slash WWDC.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:28.240]  It forwards you to the developer slash WWDC 22 page. But no, you were right, Paul. I owe you
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:32.800]  a being right point. In addition to the online conference, Apple will host a special day
[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:39.040]  for developers and students at Apple Park on June 6th to watch the keynote and State
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:43.840]  of the Union videos together, along with the online community. So they're saying,
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.280]  keynote, State of the Union, and it will be somewhere at Apple Park. Maybe there's
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:50.480]  some kind of walkway they will get people into the ring. I don't know.
[02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.120]  Can they do stairs like up and over?
[02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:55.280]  Maybe, but it's—
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:35:00.240]  No, no, no. It's four stories tall. I don't think that's how they'll do it.
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:07.280]  I don't know. I'm very intrigued now, now that I think about it, where they're going to do it.
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:12.240]  If there's some way they can create a walkthrough through the ring. But I don't even know where
[02:35:12.240 --> 02:35:16.640]  the people would park, though, because I think it's actually quite a hall from the Visitor Center.
[02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:24.160]  And the Visitor Center, I don't think, is meant to have that many people park. I certainly don't
[02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.600]  think 4,000 people.
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:30.160]  Well, it's certainly unclear what sort of numbers we're talking about. I think it says space is
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:37.040]  limited, details, blah, blah, blah. But if there's a thousand people, that's a number
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:40.880]  that makes sense to me. But even that, it sounds like, would be potentially too many for
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:43.840]  a lot of this for the infrastructure.
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:48.160]  Right. I mean, honest to God, I don't want to harp on parking too much, but
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:54.960]  it's not like—all right, San Francisco, when it was at Moscone, there were dozens and dozens of
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:36:01.280]  hotels within walking distance of Moscone, because it's downtown San Francisco. Literally, the area
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:06.160]  is built up around the convention center, or they put the convention center there because the hotels
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:10.320]  were already there. San Jose, not as many hotels.
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:13.360]  But still a city.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:16.960]  Still a city. The same great prices for hotels.
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.440]  What should we say about the quality of the hotels by comparison?
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:24.640]  Mustier.
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:28.800]  Danker.
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:32.720]  More employees enjoying their first day on the job.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:35.600]  Than anywhere I've ever been.
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:41.600]  You know, but you still get those great $500 a night prices for a mid-price two-queen room.
[02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:46.080]  You can't beat it, really. But still, wherever you stayed in San Jose,
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.520]  you could walk to whatever the name of the convention center is there.
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:50.880]  I had a broken foot and I did it.
[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:54.080]  Yes, you did. That is actually true, although you kind of wheeled yourself.
[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:56.480]  No, no, I was hobbling. I had the peg leg.
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.840]  Oh, that's right, the peg leg. Yeah, that's right. Good times.
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.120]  Yeah, the best. But yeah, it was doable because it was in a city and it worked.
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:10.000]  I've never tried it. I mean, I've been to multiple events at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park,
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.200]  but it's nowhere near any hotels that I'm aware of. I mean, certainly not walking distance. I mean,
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:23.200]  there was a weird hotel in Cupertino that you can definitely easily walk to Infinite Loop,
[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:30.000]  but it's miles away from Apple Park. And I don't know. And it's like, so how many, you know,
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.680]  if you're not local, how do you get there? You don't have to rent a car. You could take an Uber,
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:38.960]  but how many thousands of people can show up in an Uber on the same morning, you know?
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:42.320]  And it's like, you know, I don't know. I don't know what that's going to be like. It's going to
[02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:46.320]  be, they must have something in mind, but. They must have something planned. I mean,
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:50.720]  shuttle bus is something, but yeah, that's interesting to think about. It's not something
[02:37:50.720 --> 02:37:55.120]  that I had thought about as far as just sort of the security of the campus and not necessarily
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:38:00.640]  wanting people to park in the employee parking lot, which has employee parking garage, which
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.680]  has thousands of spaces or anything like that. It feels, when I've been there, it feels like,
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:12.800]  in fact, at one time they had an event that I was at where they did have a certain fitness component.
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:20.240]  And like I've been to their fitness center for employees because they've used it to demo stuff.
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:25.280]  It's far enough from the Steve Jobs Theater that they had like golf carts to take people.
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:30.880]  No, they really did. And I think I wanted to turn it down and they're like, no, no,
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.760]  you got to take a golf cart. You got to take the cart. And they golf cart you around in it,
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:43.520]  you know? You or I, when your foot isn't broken, would easily walk it. It's like walking a couple
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:48.240]  holes of a golf course or something, but it's certainly not walkable for everybody of all ages
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:56.240]  and state of their broken foot. There's all sorts of reasons. It's not close though. The visitor
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:39:01.840]  center is close-ish to the Steve Jobs Theater, but the Steve Jobs Theater is not that close to
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:07.600]  the ring. And that's just the outside of the ring. So I don't know. I don't know what they're going
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.240]  to do. Although there is a lot of green space in between. Maybe that's where they'll put something
[02:39:12.240 --> 02:39:18.960]  outside the ring, but in the big green space that's in between. Who knows? But then that
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:20.880]  raises the question. Well, we'll see in what? Two months.
[02:39:20.880 --> 02:39:25.600]  Yeah. Well, and it raises the question of are they also, are they going to have media onsite
[02:39:25.600 --> 02:39:32.800]  for the keynote? Which I believe they will be willing to wait until the end of May.
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:34.560]  Like a week before it. Yeah, right.
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:40.640]  Right. And just, you know, and because what do they care if some people have to fly from
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:48.000]  London or Europe or way further away than I do? They'll fill up the room, that's for sure.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:54.080]  You'll get there or you won't. And yeah, exactly. I mean, even for developers, as you alluded to
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:59.280]  earlier, they've never announced this a year in advance or six months in advance. It's two or
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:04.560]  three months heads up to try and book a room in San Jose and get flights and everything. So yeah.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:08.720]  So if the developers aren't getting much heads up, the media certainly is not going to get any.
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:12.240]  You and I, how many years have you and I spent
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.200]  bargain hunting hotels based on guest WWDC days?
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:23.280]  Oh, God. Yeah. From when it was in San Francisco, we could see the calendar of the
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:29.440]  Moscone Center and see, okay, that week is blocked off and this hotel reservation is cancelable. So
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.480]  I'll book one that week. I mean, reading tea leaves to go to a conference is ridiculous,
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:41.600]  but that's what we were reduced to. Yeah. And I would buy Southwest airline tickets
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:46.640]  because they're fully refundable. I forget if you get your money back or just credit, but I knew I'd
[02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:51.360]  fly somewhere else and I wouldn't be paying any kind of fee on the airline tickets. It was a
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:55.920]  nightmare. But anyway, I'm sure I'll find out. What is it? June 6th? I'll probably find out.
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:59.920]  June 6th. So by June 4th, you'll definitely know if you're going out there.
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:05.680]  Well, the ultimate was the... And again, I think it might have... No, it wasn't Antennagate,
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:11.280]  but Antennagate was when I had my crowning moment and asked Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller and Tim
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:17.360]  Cook and Big Bob whether they used the bumper case on their iPhone 4. And all four of them
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.160]  took out their phones and showed that they just keep them in their pocket without a case.
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:25.120]  Had no case whatsoever. Yeah. And were making phone calls just fine.
[02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:30.240]  But that was my... Number one, it's not because I'm shy, it's because they don't take questions
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:34.960]  anymore. I've always got a question that I would ask if they took them. But that was my question.
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:41.520]  But I made the Antennagate press conference. I had a phone call from Apple PR around three
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:49.680]  in the afternoon, Philly time. Can you get here tomorrow morning? And I may only be slightly
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:56.720]  exaggerating, but it was definitely like a Thursday afternoon. And money was... Revenue at
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:02.560]  Daring Fireball was not what it is today. It was theoretically possible that I could get a flight,
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:07.680]  but it would be out of the budget. But I got like a United flight at 420. I was like,
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:11.120]  hey, Amy, I'm going to California. I gotta go to the airport.
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:16.320]  She's like, when? And I'm like, oh, no, now I'm packing. She's like, what are you talking about?
[02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:21.520]  And I'm like, oh my God, it's the antenna thing. There we go. But no, it was like,
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:28.800]  I would say 18 hours of notice. But now that was an emergency press conference. Like you said,
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:33.040]  I'm sure they'll give me at least two days for WWDC. I thank you for your time. This is long,
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:37.520]  but we did have four sponsors. So it kind of made it worthwhile for everybody. Everybody should
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:44.080]  absolutely check out Audio Hijack 4. It is at the Rogue Amoeba website. Do you play the Wordle?
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:50.000]  Oh, let me, I do. Has Rogue come up yet? I think, I think Rogue will be one of those
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:56.800]  words of the day that's going to trip people up. Yeah. No, no A, no E, no N, no S. Yeah. That's a,
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:43:01.360]  that's a, that's a tricky one. No, it's got an E. Rogue, Rogue. Oh, you're right. You're right. I
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:05.520]  was running through the most common letters in my head. All right. So no, no N, no S, no, yeah,
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.120]  I don't know. I think people would get that, but wait, let me, let me, let me, I've probably done
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:13.040]  this on the show before, but we've got, because no one could spell Rogue as I even just demonstrated
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:18.400]  and no one can spell Amoeba. We've got the website to go to is just macaudio.com. Oh.
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:25.280]  So yeah, a few years ago we snapped that up when it became available and basically use it for
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:30.800]  nothing but podcasts because everyone, if you can't spell macaudio.com, then I don't know,
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:36.960]  we can't help you. I gotta say that Rogue Amoeba definitely has the highest vowel to consonant
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:43.120]  ratio of any company in the indie Mac space. Ooh. Yeah, probably. That's probably right. Pretty high.
[02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:51.760]  You'd have to be like AAA, AAA ado to, to beat it, but all right. So macaudio.com and you,
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:56.080]  it'll just what redirect people? It just takes you to rogueamoeba.com. If you want to try and
[02:43:56.080 --> 02:44:00.640]  spell rogueamoeba.com, you can, but Amoeba has multiple valid spellings and we don't own all
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:07.840]  of them. And everyone spells the word rogue as rouge. So. Hmm. Oh yeah. Macaudio.com. Yeah.
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.880]  Yeah, the U's in there somewhere. The G's in the middle. Just, just figure it out. Yeah. So you
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:18.640]  don't have rouge. Do you have rouge? We have rouge amoeba. We have, I forget if we have one of the
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:24.160]  other spellings of amoeba, but Google makes this, you know, web searching, duck, duck, go, whatever.
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:29.360]  Search engines make this unnecessary except in a case like a podcast where, you know, someone
[02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:34.480]  might just type it in and totally muff it. And my thanks also, in addition that you for your time
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:38.880]  and your, your keen observations on this, I'll thank all of the sponsors of this episode. We
